TI  == enterococcus faecalis lipoteichoic acid suppresses aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide-induced il-8 expression in human periodontal ligament cells.
AB  == periodontitis is caused by multi-bacterial infection and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and enterococcus faecalis are closely associated with inflammatory periodontal diseases. although lipopolysaccharide (lps) of a. actinomycetemcomitans (aa.lps) and lipoteichoic acid of e. faecalis (ef.lta) are  considered to be major virulence factors evoking inflammatory responses, their combinatorial effect on the induction of chemokines has not been investigated. in this study, we investigated the interaction between aa.lps and ef.lta on il-8 expression in human periodontal ligament (pdl) cells. aa.lps, but not ef.lta, substantially induced il-8 expression at the protein and mrna levels. interestingly, ef.lta suppressed aa.lps-induced il-8 expression without affecting the binding of aa.lps to toll-like receptor (tlr) 4. ef.lta reduced aa.lps-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, including erk, jnk and p38 kinase. furthermore, ef.lta inhibited the aa.lps-induced transcriptional activities of the activating protein 1, ccaat/enhancer-binding protein and nuclear factor-kappa b transcription factors, all of which are known  to regulate il-8 gene expression. ef.lta augmented the expression of il-1 receptor-associated kinase-m (irak-m), a negative regulator of tlr intracellular  signaling pathways, in the presence of aa.lps at both the mrna and protein levels. small interfering rna silencing irak-m reversed the attenuation of aa.lps-induced il-8 expression by ef.lta. collectively, these results suggest that ef.lta down-regulates aa.lps-induced il-8 expression in human pdl cells through up-regulation of the negative regulator irak-m.

TI  == bactericidal activity and mechanism of photoirradiated polyphenols against gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
AB  == the bactericidal effect of various types of photoirradiated polyphenols against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was evaluated in relation to the mode of action. gram-positive bacteria (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus mutans) and gram-negative bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) suspended in a 1 mg/ml polyphenol aqueous solution (caffeic acid, gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, and proanthocyanidin) were exposed to led light (wavelength, 400 nm; irradiance, 260 mw/cm2) for 5 or 10 min. caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid exerted the highest bactericidal activity  followed by gallic acid and proanthocyanidin against both gram-positive and -negative bacteria. it was also demonstrated that the disinfection treatment induced oxidative damage of bacterial dna, which suggests that polyphenols are incorporated into bacterial cells. the present study suggests that blue light irradiation of polyphenols could be a novel disinfection treatment.

TI  == microleakage of bacteria in different implant-abutment assemblies: an in vitro study.
AB  == purpose: the aim of the present in vitro study was to evaluate the leakage observed for 2 different microbial species at the level of the implant-abutment (i-a) interface, and the marginal fit and size of microgap at the i-a interface in 2 different implant connections. methods: ten specimens of each group were tested. the inner parts of 5 implants per group were inoculated with 0.1 mul of a viable enterococcus faecalis suspension and 5 implants per group with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. all of the vials containing the control specimens were incubated at 37 degrees c under aerobic condition for e. faecalis  and 37 degrees c in presence of 5% co2 for a. actinomycetemcomitans. they were maintained for 14 days, and the possible penetration of bacterial suspension into the surrounding solution was determined by the observation of turbidity of the broth. the i-a interface was evaluated for size of microgap and measured under sem. five implants of each group were evaluated. the marginal fit between implant and abutment was measured at 8 random locations in each assembly, under different magnifications at the interface. results: no leakages through the i-a interface were demonstrated for either type of connection evaluated. the microgap values of all i-a interfaces ranged from 0.008 to 2.009 mum; the differences between the 2  systems were statistically significant. conclusions: the present study demonstrated that a good marginal fit of implant components seemed to be able to  prevent bacterial leakage.

TI  == integration of non-oral bacteria into in vitro oral biofilms.
AB  == biofilms are polymicrobial communities that grow on surfaces in nature. oral bacteria can spontaneously form biofilms on the surface of teeth, which may compromise the health of the teeth, or their surrounding (periodontal) tissues. while the oral bacteria exhibit high tropism for their specialized ecological niche, it is not clear if bacteria that are not part of the normal oral microbiota can efficiently colonize and grow within oral biofilms. by using an in vitro "supragingival" biofilm model of 6 oral species, this study aimed to investigate if 3 individual bacterial species that are not part of the normal oral microbiota (eschericia coli, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecails) and one not previously tested oral species (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) can be incorporated into this established supragingival biofilm model. staphylococcus aureus and a. actinomycetemcomitans were able to grow efficiently in the biofilm, without disrupting the growth of the remaining species. they localized in sparse small aggregates within the biofilm mass. enterococcus faecalis and e. coli were both able to populate the biofilm at high  numbers, and suppressed the growth of a. oris and s. mutants. enterococcus faecalis was arranged in a chain-like conformation, whereas e. coli was densely and evenly spread throughout the biofilm mass. in conclusion, it is possible for  selected species that are not part of the normal oral microbiota to be introduced into an oral biofilm, under the given experimental micro-environmental conditions. moreover, the equilibrated incorporation of a. actinomycetemcomitans  and s. aureus in this oral biofilm model could be a useful tool in the study of aggressive periodontitis and peri-implantitis, in which these organisms are involved, respectively.

TI  == improving photodynamic inactivation of bacteria in dentistry: highly effective and fast killing of oral key pathogens with novel tooth-colored type-ii photosensitizers.
AB  == increasing antibiotic resistances in microorganisms create serious problems in public health. this demands alternative approaches for killing pathogens to supplement standard treatment methods. photodynamic inactivation of bacteria (pib) uses light activated photosensitizers (ps) to generate reactive oxygen species immediately upon illumination, inducing lethal phototoxicity. positively  charged phenalen-1-one derivatives are a new generation of ps for light-mediated  killing of pathogens with outstanding singlet oxygen quantum yield phidelta of >97%. upon irradiation with a standard photopolymerizer light (bluephase c8, 1260 +/- 50 mw/cm(2)) the ps showed high activity against the oral key pathogens enterococcus faecalis, actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mutans, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. at a concentration of 10 mum, a maximum efficacy of more than 6 log10 steps (>/= 99.9999%) of bacteria killing is reached in less than 1 min (light dose 50 j/cm(2)) after one single treatment. the pyridinium substituent as positively charged moiety is especially advantageous for antimicrobial action.

TI  == antibiogram pattern of oral microflora in periodontic children of age group 6 to  12 years: a clinicomicrobiological study.
AB  == aim: the study was carried out to see the diversity of oral microflora and its antibiotic sensitivity test in children of age group 6 to 12 years was carried. materials and methods: total 50 patients of age group 6 to 12 years were analyzed for their oral microflora and then checked for the antibiotic susceptibility test. the samples that were collected were incubated at 37 degrees c for 48 hours. once dispersed samples were taken and gram staining was done, also they were spread on to a number of freshly prepared agar plates and incubated to allow cells to form microbial colony. results: the result showed microflora common in all types, gram-positive facultative anaerobic rods and cocci. in normal children gram-positive facultative anaerobic and fermenting cocci were predominant where as in children with caries growth of microbiota that were gram-negative and positive, capnophilic, motile and anaerobic rods and cocci belonging to members of genera s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans was seen. conclusion: by the present study it has been concluded that the number of bacteria determined by microscopic counts was twice as high in caries patients as in healthy sites, and  also recommended that amoxicillin, ampicillin and amikacin are the most effective antibacterial drugs for the treatment of dental caries.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection  treatment with photolysis of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 and comparing this with existing antibacterial agents. we tested seven antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, cefepime hydrochloride, erythromycin, ofloxacin, clindamycin hydrochloride, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, and minocycline hydrochloride, as positive controls for validation of the assay protocol. for all of the agents tested, at least one of the four bacterial species (staphylococcus  aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and streptococcus salivarius) was resistant to these agents by repeated exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of the agents up to 10 times. in contrast, antibacterial activity  against any of the bacterial species tested (s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. coli, s.  salivarius, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus mutans, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) was not affected by repeated exposure to the disinfection  treatment up to 40 times. this finding suggested that the risk of inducing bacterial resistance by disinfection treatment was low. the active ingredient of  this disinfection treatment is hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis of h2o2. therefore, hydroxyl radicals interact with several cell structures and different  metabolic pathways in microbial cells, probably resulting in a lack of development of bacterial resistance. in conclusion, disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 appears to be a potential alternative for existing antimicrobial agents in terms of a low risk of inducing bacterial resistance.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (itcs) extracted from horseradish (armoracia rusticana) root against oral microorganisms.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (itcs) extracted from horseradish root was investigated against oral microorganisms: 6 strains of facultative anaerobic bacteria, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus casei, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans; one strain of yeast, candida albicans, and 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella nigrescens, and clostridium perfringens. the itcs extracted from horseradish root showed antimicrobial activity against all oral microorganisms by the paper disk method.  the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of the itcs extracted from horseradish root ranged from 1.25 to 5.00 mg/ml against 6 strains of facultative  anaerobic bacteria and one strain of yeast, and 4.17 to 16.67 mg/ml against 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria. the itcs extracted from horseradish root showed the strongest antimicrobial activity, with a mbc of 1.25 mg/ml, against c. albicans among facultative microorganisms, and 4.17 mg/ml against f. nucleatum among anaerobic bacteria. these results suggest that the itcs extracted from horseradish root may be a candidate for use as an antimicrobial agent against oral microorganisms.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in human chronic periodontitis microbiota.
AB  == background: patients with chronic periodontitis (cp) may yield multiple species of putative periodontal bacterial pathogens that vary in their antibiotic drug susceptibility. this study determines the occurrence of in vitro antibiotic resistance among selected subgingival periodontal pathogens in patients with cp.  methods: subgingival biofilm specimens from inflamed deep periodontal pockets were removed before treatment from 400 adults with cp in the united states. the samples were cultured, and selected periodontal pathogens were tested in vitro for susceptibility to amoxicillin at 8 mg/l, clindamycin at 4 mg/l, doxycycline at 4 mg/l, and metronidazole at 16 mg/l, with a post hoc combination of data for  amoxicillin and metronidazole. gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads were subjected to ciprofloxacin disk-diffusion testing. results: overall, 74.2% of the patients with cp revealed subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to at least one of the test antibiotics. one or more test species, most often prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, streptococcus constellatus, or aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, were resistant in vitro to doxycycline, amoxicillin, metronidazole, or clindamycin, in 55%, 43.3%, 30.3%, and 26.5% of the patients with cp, respectively. fifteen percent of patients harbored subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to both amoxicillin and metronidazole, which were mostly either s. constellatus (45 individuals) or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains of gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads (nine individuals). conclusions: patients with cp in the united states frequently yielded subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant in vitro to therapeutic concentrations of antibiotics commonly used in clinical periodontal practice. the wide variability  found in periodontal pathogen antibiotic-resistance patterns should concern clinicians empirically selecting antibiotic treatment regimens for patients with  cp.

TI  == effect of metalloporphyrins on red autofluorescence from oral bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the red autofluorescence from bacterial species related to dental caries and periodontitis in the presence of different nutrients in the growth medium. bacteria were grown anaerobically on tryptic soy  agar (tsa) supplemented with nutrients, including magnesium-porphyrins from spinach and iron-porphyrins from heme. the autofluorescence was then assessed at  405 nm excitation. on the tsa without additives, no autofluorescence was observed from any of the species tested. on the tsa containing sheep blood, red autofluorescence was observed only from parvimonas micra. when the tsa was supplemented with blood, hemin, and vitamin k, red autofluorescence was observed  from actinomyces naeslundii, bifidobacterium dentium, and streptococcus mutans. finally, on the tsa supplemented with spinach extract, red autofluorescence was observed from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a. naeslundii, enterococcus  faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus salivarius, s. mutans, and veillonella parvula. we conclude that the bacteria related to dental caries and periodontal disease exhibit red autofluorescence. the autofluorescence characteristics of the tested strains depended on the nutrients present, such as  metalloporphyrins, suggesting that the metabolic products of the oral biofilm could be responsible for red autofluorescence.

TI  == necrotizing periodontal diseases in hiv-infected brazilian patients: a clinical and microbiologic descriptive study.
AB  == objective: nowadays, necrotizing periodontal diseases have a low prevalence; however, a better understanding of the etiopathogenesis of these diseases is necessary for determining more adequate preventive and therapeutic strategies. method and materials: from a pool of 1,232 hiv-infected patients, 15 presented with necrotizing periodontal diseases, which were evaluated by full-mouth periodontal clinical measurements. subgingival biofilm samples were collected from necrotizing lesions of six of these individuals. the presence and levels of  47 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: all 15 patients (10 had severe immunodeficiency) had been infected sexually. thirteen patients were taking antiretroviral medication (66.7% undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy). regarding necrotizing periodontal diseases, necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (60%) was more prevalent  than necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (40%). the frequency of supragingival biofilm and bleeding on probing ranged from 11.5% to 59.2% and 3.0% to 54.0%, respectively, whereas the mean probing depth and clinical attachment level were between 1.48 and 2.61 mm and 1.30 and 2.62 mm, respectively. species detected in  high prevalence and/or counts in necrotizing lesions included treponema denticola, eikenella corrodens, dialister pneumosintes, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus intermedius, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and campylobacter rectus. in contrast, parvimonas micra, prevotella melaninogenica, fusobacterium nucleatum, eubacterium nodatum, and helicobacter pylori were observed in the lowest mean prevalence and/or counts. conclusion: necrotizing periodontal disease lesions in hiv-infected patients present a microbiota with high prevalence and/or counts of classical periodontal pathogens, in particular t denticola, as well as species not commonly considered as periodontal pathogens, such as e faecalis and d pneumosintes. in addition, these individuals with necrotizing periodontal disease frequently display severe immunodeficiency and aids-defining diseases such as tuberculosis.

TI  == association of red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans and non-oral bacteria with periodontal diseases.
AB  == objective: pathogens related to systemic infections have been detected in the periodontal microbiota. the relationship amongst these pathogens, periodontal bacteria and periodontal clinical status is poorly understood. this study evaluated the association amongst red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans (a.a) and non-oral pathogenic bacteria in subjects with good periodontal health (ph), gingivitis (g), chronic (cp) and aggressive (ap) periodontitis. methods: subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 51 ph, 42 g, 219 cp and 90 ap subjects. the presence and levels of a.a, red complex (porphyromonas gingivalis,  tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola), acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia  coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus were determined by dna probes and dna-dna hybridization technique. results: cp and ap subjects presented significantly higher prevalence and levels of a.a, red  complex and a. baumannii than g and ph individuals (p<0.01), whereas s. aureus was detected in lower frequency and counts in ap as compared to the other groups  (p<0.001). the predictor variables age, prevalence of red complex, and the presence of a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa were strongly associated with the frequency of sites with pd and cal >/=5 mm. increasing age (or 1.08), high frequency of red complex (or 6.10), and the presence of a.a with p. aeruginosa (or 1.90) were associated with periodontal disease (p<0.001). subjects harbouring a high prevalence of a.a, a. baumannii, and red complex with p. aeruginosa were more likely to have ap than cp (p<0.001). conclusion: putative periodontal pathogens and non-oral bacteria alone or in association were strongly associated  with periodontitis.

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic species--an in vitro study.
AB  == the in vitro study was aimed to determine the effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic microorganisms. ozone was generated for 6 s-2 x 24 s (corresponding to 0.56 mg-2 x 2.24 mg of ozone) against 23 mainly anaerobic periodontopathogenic species. agar diffusion test was used as a screening method. then, the killing activity was tested in a serum-free environment and with 25% v/v inactivated serum. further, the effect of ozone on bactericidal activity of native serum was analyzed against fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. agar diffusion test showed a high efficacy of ozone against microorganisms, especially against porphyromonas gingivalis. this result was confirmed by the killing tests; most of the strains in a concentration of 10(5) were completely eliminated after twofold 18-s application of ozone. only four of the six potentially "superinfecting" species (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, candida albicans) survived in part. addition of heat-inactivated serum reduced the killing rate of ozone by 78% after 6-s and by 47% after twofold 18-s exposures; no strain was completely eradicated after any application of ozone. the bactericidal effect of native serum was enhanced after application of ozone; no effect was visible on the included a. actinomycetemcomitans strain which was found to be completely resistant to the bactericidal action of serum. in conclusion, (a) ozone has a strong antibacterial activity against putative periodontopathogenic microorganisms, and (b) the bactericidal effect is reduced in the presence of serum. ozone may have potential as an adjunctive application to mechanical treatment in periodontitis patients.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of diterpenes from viguiera arenaria against endodontic bacteria.
AB  == six pimarane-type diterpenes isolated from viguiera arenaria baker and two semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated in vitro against a panel of representative microorganisms responsible for dental root canal infections. the microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) against porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus faecalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid, its sodium salt and ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol were the most active, displaying mic values ranging from 1 to 10 mug ml-1. the results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new chemicals for use as a complement to instrumental endodontic procedures.

TI  == photolysis of hydrogen peroxide, an effective disinfection system via hydroxyl radical formation.
AB  == the relationship between the amount of hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis  of h(2)o(2) and bactericidal activity was examined. h(2)o(2) (1 m) was irradiated with laser light at a wavelength of 405 nm to generate hydroxyl radicals. electron spin resonance spin trapping analysis showed that the amount of hydroxyl radicals produced increased with the irradiation time. four species of pathogenic oral bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus mutans, and enterococcus faecalis, were used in the bactericidal assay. s. mutans in a model biofilm was also examined. laser irradiation of suspensions in 1 m h(2)o(2) resulted in a >99.99% reduction of the viable counts  of each of the test species within 3 min of treatment. treatment of s. mutans in  a biofilm resulted in a >99.999% reduction of viable counts within 3 min. other results demonstrated that the bactericidal activity was dependent on the amount of hydroxyl radicals generated. treatment of bacteria with 200 to 300 mum hydroxyl radicals would result in reductions of viable counts of >99.99%.

TI  == combination of 10% edta, photosan, and a blue light hand-held photopolymerizer to inactivate leading oral bacteria in dentistry in vitro.
AB  == aims: the goal of this study was to investigate the phototoxicity of photosan in  combination with edta and a hand-held photopolymerizer used in dentistry for light-curing resins against leading key pathogens in caries, endodontic treatment failures, and periodontitis respectively. methods and results: cellular uptake of photosan was detected by fluorescence spectroscopy for streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis but not for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. addition of 10% edta enabled the uptake of photosan by a. actinomycetemcomitans. killing of s. mutans and e. faecalis mediated by photosan and blue light was concentration and light dose dependent, achieving a >or=99.9% (>or=3 log(10) reduction) efficacy of bacteria killing. in the presence of 10% edta, photosan induced a reduction of >or=4 log(10) in the viability of a. actinomycetemcomitans at a concentration of 50 microg ml(-1), upon activation at a dose of 9.65 j cm(-2) for 60 s. edta alone, light alone, and photosan alone were not able to kill bacteria. conclusions: ten per cent edta and photosan cause a potent phototoxicity against oral bacteria upon illumination with a photopolymerizer. significance and impact of the study: increasing antibiotic resistance and insufficient drug concentrations within the sulcus fluid are responsible for lacking antimicrobial efficacy. this study provides useful information that combination of photosan, edta, and a photopolymerizer may be a potentially powerful tool for the efficient destroying of key oral bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial effectiveness of electro-chemically activated water as an endodontic irrigation solution.
AB  == aim: the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effectiveness of electro-chemically activated water (eca) as an endodontic irrigation solution. methodology: the root canals of 60 caries-free, single-rooted, adult, maxillary, anterior human teeth were instrumented and irrigated in a similar method to that used for in vivo root canal treatment. the  external root surface of each tooth was sealed, maintaining the access cavities patent and the root canals were inoculated with a suspension containing four bacteria. the teeth were randomly divided into four groups (n = 15). each group was irrigated ultrasonically with one of the following solutions: distilled water (control), naocl (3.5%), and eca, the latter at phs 7.0 and 9.0. antimicrobial effectiveness was established directly after irrigation and again 7 days later, by counting colony-forming units on blood agar plates and by spectrophotometric analysis. results: large numbers of bacteria were present in the canals of teeth  irrigated with distilled water. no bacteria were observed following irrigation with naocl. neither of the eca solutions were found to be effective against all the bacteria. although some reduction in the number of bacteria was evident in the eca groups, this was not statistically significant (p > 0.05) when compared to sodium hypochlorite. conclusion: within the confines of this study eca did not demonstrate antimicrobial effectiveness.

TI  == serum antibodies reacting with subgingival species in refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the levels of serum igg antibody to 85 subgingival species in 32 refractory periodontitis, 56 successfully treated, and 33 periodontally healthy subjects. refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or >3 sites showing attachment loss >2.5 mm within 1 year after 2 treatment modalities, scaling and root planing and surgery plus systemically administered tetracycline. successfully-treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss >2.5 mm, 1 year post-therapy. periodontally healthy subjects exhibited no pocket or attachment level >3 mm, and no evidence of progressing attachment loss during 1 year of monitoring. baseline serum was obtained from each subject and tested against 85 subgingival species, including reference strains and strains isolated from refractory subjects, using checkerboard immunoblotting. significance of differences in levels of serum antibody among groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis test. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based  on their serum antibody response to subgingival species. some individuals had antibody reactions to many subgingival species, while other subjects showed fewer or low numbers of responses. on average, refractory subjects exhibited higher numbers and levels of serum antibody reactions to a wide range of subgingival species than successfully treated or periodontally healthy subjects. differences  in serum antibody among clinical groups were more striking at higher threshold levels of antibody (>50 microg/ml and > 100 microg/ml). the data showed that a subject was 10.1 x more likely to be refractory if the subject exhibited antibody reactions with >9 subgingival species at >50 microg/ml (p<0.001, after adjusting  for multiple comparisons). serum antibody to a subset of the test species differed among the clinical groups. porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroidesforsythus, and some strains isolated from refractory subjects (a novel neisseria sp., enterococcus faecalis, prevotella loescheii and prevotella oulora) elicited high serum antibody in the successfully treated and refractory subjects. high levels of serum antibody to a microbacterium lacticum-like organism, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus constellatus, actinobacillus actinonmycetemcomitans serotype c and haemophilus aphrophilus significantly increased the likelihood of a subject being refractory to conventional periodontal therapy.
