TI  == newly documented antimicrobial activity of quinolones.
AB  == the improved antimicrobial activity of newer fluoroquinolones and novel applications recently found for the drugs already marketed are reviewed. several  new compounds are more active against gram-positive bacteria than the presently marketed fluoroquinolones. win 57273, the most potent compound in vitro on a weight basis, is 16 to 128 times more active than ciprofloxacin against various staphylococci, streptococci, enterococcus spp., corynebacterium spp., listeria monocytogenes and bacillus spp. bmy 40062, pd 117558, pd 127391, sparfloxacin, temafloxacin and tosufloxacin also show enhanced in vitro efficacy against these  species. these drugs also possess increased activity against various anaerobes, notably clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile and the bacteroides fragilis group. mycobacterium tuberculosis, rapidly growing mycobacteria other than mycobacterium chelonae, and mycobacterium leprae are often susceptible to quinolones displaying bactericidal activity which is potentially useful for curing difficult-to-treat mycobacteriosis. in addition, a number of new products, notably those containing a cyclopropyl group, are more active than reference fluoroquinolones against mycobacterium leprae. sparfloxacin, bmy 40062 and win 57273 compare favorably with older fluoroquinolones in the killing of intracellular legionella spp., and several of the newer compounds have greater antichlamydial potency. improved antibacterial activity has also been found against mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas maltophilia. by contrast, the newer quinolones have similar or less activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae. recently, pefloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were found to be active against protozoa, including plasmodium spp., trypanosoma cruzi and leishmania donovani, but not against toxoplasma gondii. in the near future, more specific research testing unusual pathogens may lead to the identification of quinolones with more selective activity.

TI  == [reactive arthritis].
AB  == the term reactive arthritis was introduced to describe an acute non-purulent arthritis complicating an infection elsewhere in the body. reactive arthritis can also be classified into hla-b27 associated and non-associated forms. rheumatic fever is an example of the hla-b27 non-associated forms with genetic factors other than hla-b27 involved. hla-b27 associated reactive arthritis includes enteric, urogenic and idiopathic arthritides. the bacteria known to trigger post-enteritic reactive arthritis are: yersinia, salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, clostridium difficile and brucella; those known to trigger post-urethritic reactive arthritis are chlamydia trachomatis and ureaplasma urealyticum, but often the germ remains unidentified. mechanisms through which susceptibility to reactive arthritis is linked to hla-b27 antigen are still incompletely understood, but a clue could be cross-reactivity between b27 and a surface antigen of pathogenic germs. the clinical profile of the disease is characterized by an asymmetrical oligoarthritis with involvement particularly of  the peripheral joints of the lower limbs. the arthritis generally recovers without sequelae within a few weeks or months. accompanying features can be the involvement of enthesis and tendon sheets in form of a talalgia or dactylitis. in some cases the arthritis can relapse and chronicize. in some cases, in addition,  involvement of the axial skeleton can occur (spondylitis and/or sacroiliitis). another feature of the disease is the frequent association with typical extra-articular manifestations such as uveitis and muco-cutaneous lesions.
