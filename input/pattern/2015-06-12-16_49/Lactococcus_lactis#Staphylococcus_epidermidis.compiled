TI  - Staphylococcus epidermidis serine-aspartate repeat protein G (SdrG) binds to osteoblast integrin alpha V beta 3.
AB  - Staphylococcus epidermidis is the leading etiologic agent of orthopaedic implant  infection. Contamination of the implanted device during insertion allows bacteria gain entry into the sterile bone environment leading to condition known as osteomyelitis. Osteomyelitis is characterised by weakened bones associated with progressive bone loss. The mechanism through which S. epidermidis interacts with bone cells to cause osteomyelitis is poorly understood. We demonstrate here that S. epidermidis can bind to osteoblasts in the absence of matrix proteins. S. epidermidis strains lacking the cell wall protein SdrG had a significantly reduced ability to bind to osteoblasts. Consistent with this, expression of SdrG in Lactococcus lactis resulted in significantly increased binding to the osteoblasts. Protein analysis identified that SdrG contains a potential integrin recognition motif. alphaVbeta3 is a major integrin expressed on osteoblasts and typically recognises RGD motifs in its ligands. Our results demonstrate that S. epidermidis binds to recombinant purified alphaVbeta3, and that a mutant lacking SdrG failed to bind. Blocking alphaVbeta3 on osteoblasts significantly reduced binding to S. epidermidis. These studies are the first to identify a mechanism through which S. epidermidis binds to osteoblasts and potentially offers a mechanism through which implant infection caused by S. epidermidis leads to osteomyelitis.
TI  - Microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of May bryndza cheese.
AB  - Diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of May bryndza cheese, a traditional Slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. Quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, E. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and Geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. Diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese, lactobacilli, lactococci and Geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) CFU/g, 10(9) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. The diversity of bacteria encompassed Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter guillouiae, Acinetobacter sp., Acinetobacter johnsonii, Citrobacter braakii, Clostridium bartlettii, Corynebacterium callunae, Corynebacterium maris, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus pallens, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Hafnia alvei, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "Leuconostoc garlicum", Mannheimia glucosida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pseudomonas sp., Ps. fluorescens, "Ps. reactans", Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, "Rothia arfidiae", Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. felis, Staph. pasteuri, Staph. sciuri, Staph. xylosus, Streptococcus parauberis, Str. thermophilus and Variovorax paradoxus. The diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed Alternaria alternata, "Ascomycete sp.", Aspergillus fumigatus, Beauveria brongniartii, Candida xylopsoci, C. inconspicua, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Debaromyces hansenii, Fomes fomentarius, Galactomyces candidus, Gymnoascus reesii, Chaetomium globosum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Metarhizium anisopliae, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, P. camemberti, P. freii, P. polonicum, P. viridicatum, Pichia kudriavzevii, Sordaria alcina, Trichosporon lactis and Yarrowia lipolytica.
TI  - The role of ionic interactions in the adherence of the Staphylococcus epidermidis adhesin SdrF to prosthetic material.
AB  - Staphylococcus epidermidis infections are common complications of prosthetic device implantation. SdrF, a surface protein, appears to play a critical role in the initial colonization step by adhering to type I collagen and Dacron. The role of ionic interactions in S. epidermidis adherence to prosthetic material was examined. SdrF was cloned and expressed in Lactococcus lactis. The effect of pH, cation concentration, and detergents on adherence to different types of plastic surfaces was assessed by crystal violet staining and bacterial cell counting. SdrF, in contrast with controls and other S. epidermidis surface proteins, bound to hydrophobic materials such as polystyrene. Binding was an ionic interaction and was affected by surface charge of the plastic, pH, and cation concentration. Adherence of the SdrF construct was increased to positively charged plastics and was reduced by increasing concentrations of Ca(2+) and Na(+). Binding was optimal at pH 7.4. Kinetic studies demonstrated that the SdrF B domain as well as one of the B subdomains was sufficient to mediate binding. The SdrF construct also bound more avidly to Goretex than the lacotococcal control. SdrF is a multifunctional protein that contributes to prosthetic devices infections by ionic, as well as specific receptor-ligand interactions.
TI  - Typing of bacteriophages by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR to assess genetic diversity.
AB  - The recent boom in phage therapy and phage biocontrol requires the design of suitable cocktails of genetically different bacteriophages. The current methods for typing phages need significant quantities of purified DNA, may require a priori genetic information and are cost and time consuming. We have evaluated the randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR technique to produce unique and reproducible band patterns from 26 different bacteriophages infecting Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactococcus lactis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus thermophilus, Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus casei bacterial strains. Initially, purified DNA and phage suspensions of seven selected phages were used as a template. The conditions that were found to be optimal 8 muM of 10-mer primers, 3 muM magnesium oxalacetate and 5% dimethyl sulfoxide. The RAPD genomic fingerprints using a phage titer suspension higher than 10(9) PFU mL(-1) were highly reproducible. Clustering by the Pearson correlation coefficient and the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages clustering algorithm correlated largely with genetically different phages infecting the same bacterial species, although closely related phages with a similar DNA restriction pattern were indistinguishable. The results support the use of RAPD-PCR for quick typing of phage isolates and preliminary assessment of their genetic diversity bypassing tedious DNA purification protocols and previous knowledge of their sequence.
TI  - Role of surface protein SasG in biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The SasG surface protein of Staphylococcus aureus has been shown to promote the formation of biofilm. SasG comprises an N-terminal A domain and repeated B domains. Here we demonstrate that SasG is involved in the accumulation phase of biofilm, a process that requires a physiological concentration of Zn(2+). The B domains, but not the A domain, are required. Purified recombinant B domain protein can form dimers in vitro in a Zn(2+)-dependent fashion. Furthermore, the protein can bind to cells that have B domains anchored to their surface and block biofilm formation. The full-length SasG protein exposed on the cell surface is processed within the B domains to a limited degree, resulting in cleaved proteins of various lengths being released into the supernatant. Some of the released molecules associate with the surface-exposed B domains that remain attached to the cell. Studies using inhibitors and mutants failed to identify any protease that could cause the observed cleavage within the B domains. Extensively purified recombinant B domain protein is very labile, and we propose that cleavage occurs spontaneously at labile peptide bonds and that this is necessary for biofilm formation.
TI  - Origin of the putrescine-producing ability of the coagulase-negative bacterium Staphylococcus epidermidis 2015B.
AB  - A multiplex PCR method, aimed at the detection of genes associated with biogenic  amine production, identified the odc gene encoding ornithine decarboxylase in 1 of 15 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis. The ability of the positive strain, S. epidermidis 2015B, to produce putrescine in vitro was demonstrated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In this strain, the odc gene was detected on plasmid DNA, suggesting that the ability to form putrescine is carried by a mobile element, which explains the fact that the trait is strain dependent within the S. epidermidis species. A 6,292-bp nucleotide sequence harboring the putative odc gene was determined. S. epidermidis ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) showed 60 to 65% sequence identity with known ODCs of Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative bacteria. Downstream of the odc gene, a gene encoding a putative amino acid transporter was found that shared 59% sequence identity with the ornithine/putrescine exchanger (PotE) of Escherichia coli. Cloning and expression of the potE gene of S. epidermis 2015B in Lactococcus lactis demonstrated that the gene product transported ornithine and putrescine into the cells and efficiently exchanged putrescine for ornithine. Analysis of the flanking regions showed high identity levels with different S. epidermidis plasmid sequences, which would confirm the plasmidic location of the odc operon. It follows that the odc and potE gene pair encodes a putrescine-producing pathway in S. epidermis 2015B that was acquired through horizontal gene transfer.
TI  - Heart valve allograft decontamination with antibiotics: impact of the temperature of incubation on efficacy.
AB  - Heart valve allografts are typically processed at 4 degrees C in North America, including the step of antibiotic decontamination. In our own experience with heart valve banking, we often observe persistent positive cultures following decontamination at wet ice temperature. We hypothesized that warmer temperatures of incubation might increase the efficacy of the decontamination procedure. In a first series of experiments, 12 different bacterial species were grown overnight, frozen in standardized aliquots and used directly to inoculate antibiotic cocktail aliquots at 10(5) colony-forming units (CFU)/ml. The antibiotic cocktail contains vancomycin (50 mug/ml), gentamicin (80 mug/ml) and cefoxitin (240 mug/ml) in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium. Inoculated aliquots were incubated at 4, 22 and 37 degrees C and CFUs were determined at regular intervals up to 24 h post-inoculation. In a second set of experiments, 10 heart valves were spiked with 5000 CFU/ml and incubated with antibiotics at 4 and 37 degrees C for 24 h. The final rinse solutions of these heart valves were filtered and tested for bacterial growth. After 24 h of incubation, CFUs of all 12 bacterial species were reduced by a factor of only one to two logs at 4 degrees C whereas log reductions of 3.7 and 5.0 or higher were obtained at 22 and 37 degrees C, respectively. Most microorganisms, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Lactococcus lactis lactis and Propionibacterium acnes survived well the 24-h antibiotic treatment at 4 degrees C (< 1 Log reduction). All 10 heart valves that were spiked with microorganisms had positive final rinse solutions after antibiotic soaking at 4 degrees C, whereas 8 out of 10 cultures were negative when antibiotic decontamination was done at 37 degrees C. These experiments show that a wet ice temperature greatly reduces the efficacy of the allograft decontamination process as microorganisms survived well to a 24-h 4 degrees C antibiotic treatment. This could explain the high rate of positive post-processing cultures obtained with our routine tissue decontamination procedure. Increasing the decontamination temperature from 4 to 37 degrees C may significantly reduce the incidence of post-disinfection bacterial contamination of heart valves.
TI  - The terminal A domain of the fibrillar accumulation-associated protein (Aap) of Staphylococcus epidermidis mediates adhesion to human corneocytes.
AB  - The opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus epidermidis colonizes indwelling medical devices by biofilm formation but is primarily a skin resident. In many S. epidermidis strains biofilm formation is mediated by a cell wall-anchored protein, the accumulation-associated protein (Aap). Here, we investigate the role of Aap in skin adhesion. Aap is an LPXTG protein with a domain architecture including a terminal A domain and a B-repeat region. S. epidermidis NCTC 11047 expresses Aap as localized, lateral tufts of fibrils on one subpopulation of cells (Fib(+)), whereas a second subpopulation does not express these fibrils of Aap (Fib(-)). Flow cytometry showed that 72% of NCTC 11047 cells expressed Aap and that 28% of cells did not. Aap is involved in the adhesion of Fib(+) cells to squamous epithelial cells from the hand (corneocytes), as the recombinant A-domain protein partially blocked binding to corneocytes. To confirm the role of the Aap A domain in corneocyte attachment, Aap was expressed on the surface of Lactococcus lactis MG1363 as sparsely distributed, peritrichous fibrils. The expression of Aap increased corneocyte adhesion 20-fold compared to L. lactis carrying Aap without an A domain. S. epidermidis isolates from catheters, artificial joints, skin, and the nose also used the A domain of Aap to adhere to corneocytes, emphasizing the role of Aap in skin adhesion. In addition, L. lactis expressing Aap with different numbers of B repeats revealed a positive correlation between the number of B repeats and adhesion to corneocytes, suggesting an additional function for the B region in enhancing A-domain-dependent attachment to skin. Therefore, in addition to its established role in biofilm formation, Aap can also promote adhesion to corneocytes and is likely to be an important adhesin in S. epidermidis skin colonization.
TI  - Elucidating the role of Staphylococcus epidermidis serine-aspartate repeat protein G in platelet activation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus epidermidis is a commensal of the human skin that has  been implicated in infective endocarditis and infections involving implanted medical devices. S. epidermidis induces platelet aggregation by an unknown mechanism. The fibrinogen-binding protein serine-aspartate repeat protein G (SdrG) is present in 67-91% of clinical strains. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether SdrG plays a role in platelet activation, and if so to investigate the role of fibrinogen in this mechanism. METHODS: SdrG was expressed in a surrogate host, Lactococcus lactis, in order to investigate its role in the absence of other staphylococcal components. Platelet adhesion and platelet aggregation assays were employed. RESULTS: L. lactis expressing SdrG stimulated platelet aggregation (lag time: 2.9 +/- 0.5 min), whereas the L. lactis control did not. L. lactis SdrG-induced aggregation was inhibited by alpha(IIb)beta3 antagonists and aspirin. Aggregation was dependent on both fibrinogen and IgG, and the platelet IgG receptor FcgammaRIIa. Preincubation of the bacteria with Bbeta-chain fibrinopeptide inhibited aggregation (delaying the lag time six-fold), suggesting that fibrinogen acts as a bridging molecule. Platelets adhered to L. lactis SdrG in the absence of fibrinogen. Adhesion was inhibited by alpha(IIb)beta3 antagonists, suggesting that this direct interaction involves alpha(IIb)beta3. Investigation using purified fragments of SdrG revealed a direct interaction with the B-domains. Adhesion to the A-domain involved both a fibrinogen and an IgG bridge. CONCLUSION: SdrG alone is sufficient to support platelet adhesion and aggregation through both direct and indirect mechanisms.
TI  - SdrF, a Staphylococcus epidermidis surface protein, contributes to the initiation of ventricular assist device driveline-related infections.
AB  - Staphylococcus epidermidis remains the predominant pathogen in prosthetic-device  infections. Ventricular assist devices, a recently developed form of therapy for end-stage congestive heart failure, have had considerable success. However, infections, most often caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis, have limited their long-term use. The transcutaneous driveline entry site acts as a potential portal of entry for bacteria, allowing development of either localized or systemic infections. A novel in vitro binding assay using explanted drivelines obtained from patients undergoing transplantation and a heterologous lactococcal system of surface protein expression were used to identify S. epidermidis surface components involved in the pathogenesis of driveline infections. Of the four components tested, SdrF, SdrG, PIA, and GehD, SdrF was identified as the primary ligand. SdrF adherence was mediated via its B domain attaching to host collagen deposited on the surface of the driveline. Antibodies directed against SdrF reduced adherence of S. epidermidis to the drivelines. SdrF was also found to adhere with high affinity to Dacron, the hydrophobic polymeric outer surface of drivelines. Solid phase binding assays showed that SdrF was also able to adhere to other hydrophobic artificial materials such as polystyrene. A murine model of infection was developed and used to test the role of SdrF during in vivo driveline infection. SdrF alone was able to mediate bacterial adherence to implanted drivelines. Anti-SdrF antibodies reduced S. epidermidis colonization of implanted drivelines. SdrF appears to play a key role in the initiation of ventricular assist device driveline infections caused by S. epidermidis. This pluripotential adherence capacity provides a potential pathway to infection with SdrF-positive commensal staphylococci first adhering to the external Dacron-coated driveline at the transcutaneous entry site, then spreading along the collagen-coated internal portion of the driveline to establish a localized infection. This capacity may also have relevance for other prosthetic device-related infections.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several Gram-negative  and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. METHODS: The in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against H. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. Time-kill assay was performed with two Staphylococcus spp. strains. RESULTS: Anti-H. pylori activity was detected with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus spp., 1 Enterococcus faecium and 2 Lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 H. pylori strains tested. All Staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-H. pylori effect: one Staphylococcus auricularis and two Staphylococcus epidermidis against all H. pylori tested; Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis and S. auricularis against six, five and seven H. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus against one H. pylori strain. An inhibitory effect was detected with one Escherichia coli against one H. pylori. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four H. pylori strains, and Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 H. pylori isolates. No anti-H. pylori activity was detected with one Lactobacillus spp., two Lactococcus lactis, four Streptococcus spp., one Bacillus cereus, one E. faecium, one Enterococcus faecalis, one E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. Time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two Staphylococcus spp. strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit H. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
TI  - Stability of microbial communities in goat milk during a lactation year: molecular approaches.
AB  - The microbial communities in milks from one herd were evaluated during 1-year of  lactation, using molecular methods to evaluate their stability and the effect of breeding conditions on their composition. The diversity of microbial communities was measured using two approaches: molecular identification by 16S and 18S rDNA sequencing of isolates from counting media (two milks), and direct identification using 16S rDNA from clone libraries (six milks). The stability of these communities was evaluated by counting on selective media and by Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of variable region V3 of the 16S rRNA gene and variable region V4 of the 18S rRNA gene. One hundred and eighteen milk samples taken throughout the year were analyzed. Wide diversity among bacteria and yeasts in the milk was revealed. In addition to species commonly encountered in milk, such as Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus garvieae, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus casei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus simulans, Staphylococcus caprae, Staphylococcus equorum, Micrococcus sp., Kocuria sp., Pantoea agglomerans and Pseudomonas putida, sequences were affiliated to other species only described in cheeses, such as Corynebacterium variabile, Arthrobacter sp., Brachybacterium paraconglomeratum, Clostridium sp. and Rothia sp. Several halophilic species atypical in milk were found, belonging to Jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, Salinicoccus sp., Dietza maris, Exiguobacterium, Ornithinicoccus sp. and Hahella chejuensis. The yeast community was composed of Debaryomyces hansenii, Kluyveromyces lactis, Trichosporon beigelii, Rhodotorula glutinis, Rhodotorula minuta, Candida pararugosa, Candida intermedia, Candida inconspicua, Cryptococcus curvatus and Cryptococcus magnus. The analyses of microbial counts and microbial SSCP profiles both distinguished four groups of milks corresponding to four periods defined by season and feeding regime. The microbial community was stable within each period. Milks from winter were characterized by Lactococcus and Pseudomonas, those from summer by P. agglomerans and Klebsiella and those from autumn by Chryseobacterium indologenes, Acinetobacter baumanii, Staphylococcus, Corynebacteria and yeasts. However, the composition of the community can vary according to factors other than feeding. This study opens new investigation fields in the field of raw milk microbial ecology.
TI  - A functional homing endonuclease in the Bacillus anthracis nrdE group I intron.
AB  - The essential Bacillus anthracis nrdE gene carries a self-splicing group I intron with a putative homing endonuclease belonging to the GIY-YIG family. Here, we show that the nrdE pre-mRNA is spliced and that the homing endonuclease cleaves an intronless nrdE gene 5 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the intron insertion site, producing 2-nt 3' extensions. We also show that the sequence required for efficient cleavage spans at least 4 bp upstream and 31 bp downstream of the cleaved coding strand. The position of the recognition sequence in relation to the cleavage position is as expected for a GIY-YIG homing endonuclease. Interestingly, nrdE genes from several other Bacillaceae were also susceptible to cleavage, with those of Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis (nrdE1), B. anthracis, and Bacillus thuringiensis serovar konkukian being better substrates than those of Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus lichenformis, and S. epidermidis (nrdE2). On the other hand, nrdE genes from Lactococcus lactis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Corynebacterium ammoniagenes were not cleaved. Intervening sequences (IVSs) residing in protein-coding genes are often found in enzymes involved in DNA metabolism, and the ribonucleotide reductase nrdE gene is a frequent target for self-splicing IVSs. A comparison of nrdE genes from seven gram-positive low-G+C bacteria, two bacteriophages, and Nocardia farcinica showed five different insertion sites for self-splicing IVSs within the coding region of the nrdE gene.
TI  - SdrF, a Staphylococcus epidermidis surface protein, binds type I collagen.
AB  - Staphylococcus epidermidis is the leading cause of device-related infections. These infections require an initial colonization step in which S. epidermidis adheres to the implanted material. This process is usually mediated by specific bacterial surface proteins and host factors coating the foreign device. Some of these surface proteins belong to the serine-aspartate repeat (Sdr) family, which includes adhesins from Staphyloccus aureus and S. epidermidis. Using a heterologous expression system in Lactococcus lactis to overcome possible staphylococcal adherence redundancy we observed that one of these Sdr proteins, SdrF, mediates binding to type I collagen when present on the lactococcal cell surface. We used lactococcal recombinant strains, a protein-protein interaction assay and Western ligand blot analysis to demonstrate that this process occurs via the B domain of SdrF and both the alpha1 and alpha2 chains of type I collagen. It was also found that a single B domain repeat of S. epidermidis 9491 retains the capacity to bind to type I collagen. We demonstrated that the putative ligand binding N-terminal A domain does not bind to collagen which suggests that SdrF might be a multiligand adhesin. Antibodies directed against the B domain significantly reduce in vitro adherence of S. epidermidis to immobilized collagen.
TI  - A panel of monoclonal antibodies recognizing the Staphylococcus epidermidis fibrinogen-binding MSCRAMM SdrG.
AB  - Staphylococcus epidermidis is an important opportunistic human pathogen that has  recently emerged as a major cause of foreign-body infections. The most important stage contributing to the pathogenesis of this bacteria is the initial adherence to host tissue. SdrG is a cell-wall-anchored fibrinogen-binding adhesin of S. epidermidis that has been shown to be necessary for bacterial binding to fibrinogen-coated foreign bodies, such as catheters. Here we report the generation and characterization of a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against this S. epidermidis virulence factor. Through the use of multiple in vitro assays, surface plasmon resonance, and flow cytometry, we have characterized a diverse array of MAbs that may prove to be beneficial in studies that address the precise biologic role of SdrG.
TI  - Correcting base-assignment errors in repeat regions of shotgun assembly.
AB  - Accurate base-assignment in repeat regions of a whole genome shotgun assembly is  an unsolved problem. Since reads in repeat regions cannot be easily attributed to a unique location in the genome, current assemblers may place these reads arbitrarily. As a result, the base-assignment error rate in repeats is likely to be much higher than that in the rest of the genome. We developed an iterative algorithm, EULER-AIR, that is able to correct base-assignment errors in finished genome sequences in public databases. The Wolbachia genome is among the best finished genomes. Using this genome project as an example, we demonstrated that EULER-AIR can 1) discover and correct base-assignment errors, 2) provide accurate read assignments, 3) utilize finishing reads for accurate base-assignment, and 4) provide guidance for designing finishing experiments. In the genome of Wolbachia, EULER-AIR found 16 positions with ambiguous base-assignment and two positions with erroneous bases. Besides Wolbachia, many other genome sequencing projects have significantly fewer finishing reads and, hence, are likely to contain more base-assignment errors in repeats. We demonstrate that EULER-AIR is a software tool that can be used to find and correct base-assignment errors in a genome assembly project.
TI  - Shunt infection: is there a near-miss scenario?
AB  - OBJECT: The aim of this study was to establish whether microbiological contamination at the time of shunt insertion can be detected and used to predict the likelihood of subsequent shunt infection. METHODS: A prospective study of pediatric patients undergoing primary shunt insertion was undertaken. Following the protocol devised for this study, three swab samples were collected from the surgical wounds during each procedure. These samples were incubated and subcultured, and the isolates were identified and stored. In patients who subsequently presented with clinical evidence of shunt infection, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was analyzed using microscopy, tissue cultures, and sensitivity testing. The organisms isolated at the time of shunt insertion and those responsible for subsequent shunt infection were then compared. The study population consisted of 107 pediatric patients. Because one patient underwent placement of an additional contralateral shunt system, there were 108 total shunt insertions yielding 325 swab samples. Organisms were identified in cultures of 50 swab samples (15%) obtained in 40 patients (37%). In seven of these 40 patients (17.5%) a CSF infection subsequently developed. In only one patient was the infectious organism the same as that isolated from the swab specimens. In an additional six patients (8.8%) a CSF infection occurred despite the lack of growth in the cultures from intraoperative swab samples. CONCLUSIONS: The organisms responsible for shunt infection were rarely detected in the operative wound at the time of shunt insertion, leading the authors to conclude that the vulnerable period for bacterial colonization of shunts may not be restricted to the operative procedure as is commonly believed, but may extend throughout the postoperative period of wound healing. These findings have implications not only for a better understanding of the cause of shunt infections but also for the development of strategies to prevent them.
TI  - [Regulation of nitrogen metabolism in gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - We searched for new members of the TnrA and GlnR regulons controlling assimilation of nitrogen in gram-positive bacteria. We identified the regulatory signals for these transcription factors with consensuses ATGTNAWWWWWWWTNACAT for GlnR and TGTNAWWWWWWWTNACA for TnrA. We described the structure and found new potential members for the TnrA/GlnR regulons in Bacillus subtilis, B. licheniformis, Geobacillus kaustophilus, Oceanobacillus iheyensis, for the TnrA regulon in B. halodurans and for the GlnR regulons in Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. mutans, S. agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and St. epidermidis.
TI  - Impact of the accessory gene regulatory system (Agr) on extracellular proteins, codY expression and amino acid metabolism in Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - The quorum-sensing system Agr is part of a complex regulatory network of gene expression in staphylococci. This study presents the effect of an agr mutation on a biofilm-forming Staphylococcus epidermidis isolate by employing proteome and transcriptome analysis. The agr mutant exhibited a significantly lowered amount of extracellular proteins: amongst others SspA, AtlE, GehD and the phenol soluble modulins PSM1/2. Cytoplasmic proteome analysis and expression profiling indicated that the agr inactivation led to a strongly altered regulation of metabolism and virulence. Most strikingly, expression of CodY, a global regulator of virulence and stationary phase gene expression, was decreased in the agr mutant. In this respect, homologous genes known to be controlled by CodY in Bacillus subtilis and Lactococcus lactis were found to be up-regulated in the S. epidermidis agr mutant. The combined data show that wild-type and agr mutant differ with respect to amino acid biosynthesis and oligopeptide transport, carbohydrate utilization, as well as GMP and IMP interconversion. Due to the varying physiological properties S. epidermidis agr mutants, which often occur spontaneously, might be capable of colonizing alternative ecological niches in the human host and could, therefore, have an advantage in adapting to changing environmental conditions.
TI  - Biosurfactant from Lactococcus lactis 53 inhibits microbial adhesion on silicone  rubber.
AB  - The ability of biosurfactant obtained from the probiotic bacterium Lactococcus lactis 53 to inhibit adhesion of four bacterial and two yeast strains isolated from explanted voice prostheses to silicone rubber with and without an adsorbed biosurfactant layer was investigated in a parallel-plate flow chamber. The microbial cell surfaces and the silicone rubber with and without an adsorbed biosurfactant layer were characterized using contact-angle measurements. Water contact angles indicated that the silicone-rubber surface with adsorbed biosurfactant was more hydrophilic (48 degrees) than bare silicone rubber (109 degrees). The results showed that the biosurfactant was effective in decreasing the initial deposition rates of Staphylococcus epidermidis GB 9/6 from 2,100 to 220 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), Streptococcus salivarius GB 24/9 from 1560 to 137 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), and Staphylococcus aureus GB 2/1 from 1255 to 135 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), allowing for a 90% reduction of the deposition rates. The deposition rates of Rothia dentocariosa GBJ 52/2B, Candida albicans GBJ 13/4A, and Candida tropicalis GB 9/9 were far less reduced in the presence of the biosurfactant as compared with the other strains. This study constitutes a step ahead in developing strategies to prevent microbial colonization of silicone-rubber voice prostheses.
TI  - The Staphylococcus aureus surface protein SasG and its homologues promote bacterial adherence to human desquamated nasal epithelial cells.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus binds to human desquamated nasal epithelial cells, a phenomenon likely to be important in nasal colonization. ClfB was identified previously as one staphylococcal adhesin that promoted binding to nasal epithelia. In this study, it is shown that the S. aureus surface protein SasG, identified previously by in silico analysis of genome sequences, and two homologous proteins, Pls of S. aureus and AAP of Staphylococcus epidermidis, also promote bacterial adherence to nasal epithelial cells. Conditions for in vitro expression of SasG by S. aureus were not found. Adherence assays were therefore performed with S. aureus and Lactococcus lactis expressing SasG from an expression plasmid. These studies showed that SasG did not bind several ligands typically bound by S. aureus. Significantly, SasG and Pls did promote bacterial adherence to nasal epithelial cells. Furthermore, pre-incubation of epithelial cells with purified recombinant proteins revealed that the N-terminal A regions of SasG, Pls and AAP, but not the B repeats of SasG, inhibited adherence of L. lactis expressing SasG in a dose-dependent fashion. These results suggest that SasG, Pls and AAP bind to the same as-yet-unidentified receptor on the surface of nasal epithelial cells. In addition, expression of SasG, like Pls, reduced adherence of S. aureus to fibronectin and fibrinogen.
TI  - Inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus by the commensal bacteria of human milk.
AB  - AIMS: To study the bacterial diversity in expressed human milk with a focus on detecting bacteria with an antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, known as a causative agent of maternal breast infections and neonatal infections. METHODS AND RESULTS: Random isolates (n = 509) were collected from breast milk samples (n = 40) of healthy lactating women, genotypically identified, and tested for antimicrobial activity against Staph. aureus. Commensal staphylococci (64%) and oral streptococci (30%), with Staph. epidermidis, Strep. salivarius, and Strep. mitis as the most frequent isolates, were the predominant bacterial species in breast milk. One-fifth of Staph. epidermidis and half of Strep. salivarius isolates suppressed growth of Staph. aureus. Enterococci (Ent. faecalis), isolated from 7.5% of samples, and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) (Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lact. crispatus, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconoctoc mesenteroides), isolated from 12.5% of samples, were also effective against Staph. aureus. One L. lactis isolate was shown to produce nisin, a bacteriocin used in food industry to prevent bacterial pathogens and spoilage. CONCLUSIONS: Expressed breast milk contains commensal bacteria, which inhibit Staph. aureus. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The strains inhibitory against the pathogen Staph. aureus have potential use as bacteriotherapeutic agents in preventing neonatal and maternal breast infections caused by this bacterium.
TI  - Microbial quality and direct PCR identification of lactic acid bacteria and nonpathogenic Staphylococci from artisanal low-acid sausages.
AB  - Detection of six species of lactic acid bacteria and six species of gram-positive catalase-positive cocci from low-acid fermented sausages (fuets and chorizos) was assessed by species-specific PCR. Without enrichment, Lactobacillus sakei and Lactobacillus curvatus were detected in 11.8% of the samples, and Lactobacillus plantarum and Staphylococcus xylosus were detected in 17.6%. Enriched samples allowed the detection of L. sakei and S. xylosus in all of the samples (100%) and of Enterococcus faecium in 11.8% of the sausages. The percentages of L. curvatus, L. plantarum, Staphylococcus carnosus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis varied depending on the sausage type. L. curvatus was detected in 80% of fuets and in 57% of chorizos. L. plantarum was found in 50% of fuets and 100% of chorizos. S. epidermidis was detected in only 11.8% of fuets, and S. carnosus was detected in only 5.9% of chorizos. Lactococcus lactis, Staphylococcus warneri, and Staphylococcus simulans were not detected in any sausage type. From a microbiological point of view, 70.6% of the samples could be considered of high quality, as they had low counts of Enterobacteriaceae and did not contain any of the food-borne pathogens assayed.
TI  - The Fbe (SdrG) protein of Staphylococcus epidermidis HB promotes bacterial adherence to fibrinogen.
AB  - Staphylococcus epidermidis strains HB and K28 express surface proteins called Fbe or SdrG, respectively, that have sequence similarity to the clumping factors ClfA and ClfB of Staphylococcus aureus. A mutation in the fbe gene of strain HB was isolated by directed plasmid integration using the broad-host-range temperature-sensitive plasmid pG(+)Host9 (pVE6155). An internal fragment of fbe was cloned into pG(+)Host9 and the chimaeric plasmid was mobilized from S. aureus RN4220 to S. epidermidis 9142 by conjugation promoted by plasmid pGO1. The plasmid was then transferred to S. epidermidis strain HB by phage-48-mediated transduction. The plasmid integrated into the chromosomal fbe gene at a frequency of 2.8 x 10(-4). All the survivors tested had a copy of pG(+)Host9'fbe' integrated into the chromosomal fbe gene either as a single copy or as a tandem array. Western immunoblotting showed that the wall-associated Fbe protein was absent in the mutant. Wild-type S. epidermidis HB adhered to immobilized fibrinogen in a dose-dependent and saturable fashion whereas the mutant did not bind. The Fbe proteins of HB and K28 were expressed at a high level in Lactococcus lactis MG1363 using the expression vector pKS80. These strains adhered strongly to immobilized fibrinogen. These results confirm that Fbe is a fibrinogen-binding adhesin.
TI  - Molecular and physiological characterization of dominant bacterial populations in traditional mozzarella cheese processing
AB  - The development of the dominant bacterial populations during traditional Mozzarella cheese production was investigated using physiological analyses and molecular techniques for strain typing and taxonomic identification. Analysis of RAPD fingerprints revealed that the dominant bacterial community was composed of 25 different biotypes, and the sequence analysis of 16S rDNA demonstrated that the isolated strains belonged to Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, Leuc. lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Strep. bovis, Strep. uberis, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, L. garviae, Carnobacterium divergens, C. piscicola, Aerococcus viridans, Staphylococcus carnosus, Staph. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. sulphureus and Enterococcus spp. The bacterial populations were characterized for their physiological properties. Two strains, belonging to Strep. thermophilus and L. lactis subsp. lactis, were the most acidifying; theL. lactis subsp. lactis strain was also proteolytic and eight strains were positive to citrate fermentation. Moreover, the molecular techniques allowed the identification of potential pathogens in a non-ripened cheese produced from raw milk.
TI  - Immunity to lantibiotics.
AB  - Bacteria producing bacteriocins have to be protected from being killed by themselves. This mechanism of self-protection or immunity is especially important if the bacteriocin does not need a specific receptor for its action, as is the case for the type A lantibiotics forming pores in the cytoplasmic membrane. At least two different systems of immunity have evolved in this group of bacteriocins containing modified amino acids as a result of posttranslational modification. The immunity mechanism of Pep5 in Staphylococcus epidermidis is based on inhibition of pore formation by a small 69-amino acid protein weakly associated with the outer surface of the cytoplasmic membrane. In Lactococcus lactis and Bacillus subtilis the putative immunity lipoproteins NisI and SpaI, respectively, are also located at the outer surface of the cytoplasmic membrane, suggesting that a similar mechanism might be utilized by the producers of nisin and subtilin. In addition an ABC-transport system consisting of two membrane proteins, (NisEG, SpaG and the hydrophobic domain of SpaF, and EpiEG) and a cytoplasmic protein (NisF, the cytoplasmic domain of SpaF, and EpiF) play a role in immunity of nisin, subtilin and epidermin by import, export or inhibition of pore formation by the membrane components of the transport systems. Almost nothing is known of the immunity determinants of newly described and other type of lantibiotics.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the lantibiotic Pep5 biosynthetic gene cluster and functional analysis of PepP and PepC. Evidence for a role of PepC in thioether formation.
AB  - The biosynthesis of Pep5, a lanthionine-containing antimicrobial peptide, is directed by the 20-kbp plasmid pED503. We identified a 7.9-kbp DNA-fragment within this plasmid which covers the information for Pep5 synthesis in the homologous host Staphylococcus epidermidis 5 which has been cured of pED503. This fragment contained, in addition to the previously described structural gene pepA and the immunity gene pepI [Reis, M., Eschbach-Bludau, M., Iglesias-Wind, M. I., Kupke, T. & Sahl, H.-G. (1994) Appl. Env. Microbiol. 60, 2876-2883], a gene pepT coding for a translocator of the ABC transporter family, a gene pepP coding for a serine protease and two genes pepB and pepC coding for putative modification enzymes; the gene arrangement is pepTIAPBC. We analyzed the biosynthetic genes with respect to their function in Pep5 biosynthesis. Deletion of PepT reduced Pep5 production to about 10%, indicating that it can be partially replaced by other host-encoded translocators. Inactivation of PepP by site-directed mutagenesis of the active-site His residue resulted in production of incorrectly processed Pep5 fragments with strongly reduced antimicrobial activity. Deletion of pepB and pepC leads to accumulation of Pep5 prepeptide in the cells without excretion of processed peptide. A pepC-deletion clone did not excrete correctly matured Pep5 but it did produce fragments from which serine and threonine were absent. Only one of these fragments contained a single lanthionine residue out of three expected while the remaining, unmodified cysteine residues could be detected by reaction with Ellman's reagent. These results demonstrate that PepC is a thioether-forming protein and strongly suggest that PepB is responsible for dehydration of serine and threonine.
TI  - Membrane-associated proteins encoded by the nisin gene cluster may function as a  receptor for the lantibiotic carnocin UI49.
AB  - Carnocin UI49, a lantibiotic produced by Carnobacterium piscicola shows bactericidal activity against many lactic acid bacteria. This paper describes the results of a study on the mode of action of carnocin UI49. It has previously been observed that nisin-producing Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis strains are at least 10-fold more sensitive to carnocin UI49 relative to other lactic acid bacteria. Addition of carnocin UI49 to cells of L. lactis subsp. lactis NZ9700 resulted in a dissipation of the membrane potential and a rapid hydrolysis of internal ATP. These results suggest that carnocin UI49 may act at the cytoplasmic membrane. The correlation between production of and/or immunity to nisin and sensitivity to carnocin of L. lactis subsp. lactis strains was further investigated. Several transformed L. lactis subsp. lactis strains carrying a fragment of the nisin gene cluster were tested for their sensitivity to carnocin UI49 and their immunity to nisin. The results suggest that NisP, which is one of the membrane-associated proteins involved in the production of nisin acts as receptor for carnocin UI49. This may facilitate the binding and/or insertion of carnocin UI49 into the cytoplasmic membrane thus increasing its bactericidal activity. Lantibiotic-producing and non-producing mutants of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Lactobacillus sake did not show a difference in sensitivity to carnocin UI49. The proposed receptor-mediated action of carnocin UI49 at the cytoplasmic membrane therefore seems to be specific for the nisin-producing strains.
TI  - Growth phase-dependent regulation and membrane localization of SpaB, a protein involved in biosynthesis of the lantibiotic subtilin.
AB  - The information responsible for biosynthesis of the lantibiotic subtilin is organized in an operon-like structure that starts with the spaB gene. The spaB gene encodes an open reading frame consisting of 1,030 amino acid residues, and it was calculated that a protein having a theoretical molecular mass of 120.5 kDa could be produced from this gene. This is consistent with the apparent molecular weight for SpaB of 115,000 which was estimated after sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis and identification with SpaB-specific antibodies. The SpaB protein is very similar to proteins EpiB and NisB, which were identified previously as being involved in epidermin and nisin biosynthesis. Upstream from SpaB a characteristic sigma A promoter sequence was identified. An immunoblot analysis revealed that SpaB expression was strongly regulated. No SpaB protein was detected in the early logarithmic growth phase, and maximum SpaB expression was observed in the early stationary growth phase. The expression of SpaB was strongly correlated with subtilin biosynthesis. Deletion mutations in either of two recently identified regulatory genes, spaR and spaK, which act as a "two-component" regulatory system necessary for growth phase-dependent induction of subtilin biosynthesis (C. Klein, C. Kaletta, and K. D. Entian, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 59:296-303, 1993), also resulted in failure of SpaB expression. To investigate the intracellular localization of SpaB, vesicles of Bacillus subtilis were prepared. The SpaB protein cosedimented with the vesicle fraction and was released only after vigorous resuspension of the vesicles. Our results suggest that SpaB is membrane associated and that subtilin biosynthesis occurs at the cytoplasmic membrane of B. subtilis.
TI  - [Lantibiotics, a class of ribosomally synthesized peptide antibiotics].
AB  - Lantibiotics are defined as peptide antibiotics containing the unusual amino acids mesolanthionine, 3-methyllanthionine, dehydroalanine, and dehydrobutyrine. They are synthesized by some gram-positive bacteria. Their inhibitory effect on certain other gram-positive bacteria is explained by detergent-like damage of cytoplasmic membranes. Prominent members of the lantibiotics are nisin of Lactococcus lactis, which can be used as a food preservative, subtilin of Bacillus subtilis, which is similar to nisin, and epidermin of Staphylococcus epidermidis, which is considered in the treatment of acne. Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized as prepeptides, which are posttranslationally modified. Genes probably encoding these biosynthetic enzymes and regulatory factors have been identified adjacent to the structural genes of the lantibiotics subtilin, nisin, and epidermin.
TI  - Biosynthesis of the lantibiotic nisin: genomic organization and membrane localization of the NisB protein.
AB  - Nisin produced by Lactococcus lactis 6F3 is used as a food preservative and is the most important member of a group of peptide-antibiotics containing lanthionine bridges (lantibiotics) (N. Schnell, K.-D. Entian, U. Schneider, F. Gotz, H. Zahner, R. Kellner, and G. Jung, Nature [London] 333:276-278, 1988). Nisin is ribosomally synthesized, and its structural gene, nisA, encodes a prepeptide that is posttranslationally modified, revealing the active lantibiotic (C. Kaletta and K.-D. Entian, J. Bacteriol. 171:1597-1601, 1989). Adjacent to nisA, the additional genes nisB, nisT, and nisC were identified. Over their entire sequences, these genes were homologous to genes recently identified as important for the biosynthesis of lantibiotics, that is, subtilin from Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 and epidermin from Staphylococcus epidermidis Tu 3298. Genes nisB, nisT, and nisC corresponded to open reading frames of 993, 600, and 418 amino acid residues, respectively. The nisT open reading frame is homologous to proteins of the HlyB (hemolysin B protein of Escherichia coli) subfamily. Proteins of this subfamily are responsible for the secretion of a variety of compounds, including large polypeptides, polysaccharides, and anti-drug tumors, indicating that NisT may be involved in nisin transport. Northern (RNA) blot analysis revealed a 0.3-kb transcript for the nisA structural gene, and the transcriptional start point of the nisA gene was determined by primer extension. Additionally, a mRNA of at least 3 kb was identified by using a hybridization probe specific to nisB. Antibodies were raised against the NisB protein, and Western blot (immunoblot) analysis revealed a molecular weight of about 115 kDa, which is in accordance with the theoretical protein size of 117.5 kDa as calculated from the nisB open reading frame. Several amphipathic transmembrane alpha-helices indicated that NisB is associated with the membrane. This was confirmed by preparing L. lactis vesicles. The NisB protein was tightly associated with the vesicle fraction and was released by sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment only. These results suggest that NisB is membrane associated and that nisin biosynthesis occurs at the cell membrane.
TI  - Nisin, a peptide antibiotic: cloning and sequencing of the nisA gene and posttranslational processing of its peptide product.
AB  - Nisin produced by Streptococcus lactis is used as a food preservative and is the  most important member of a group of antibiotics containing lanthionine bridges. To understand the genetic basis of these so-called lantibiotics (Schnell et al., Nature 333:276-278, 1988), we characterized the nisin structural gene, nisA, which is located on a plasmid and codes for a 57-amino-acid prepeptide. The prepeptide is processed posttranslationally to the pentacyclic antibiotic. Although nisin and the recently elucidated lantibiotic epidermin from Staphylococcus epidermidis are produced by different organisms, their gene organization is identical. As with epidermin, the nisin propeptide corresponds to the C-terminus of the prepeptide. The N-terminus of the prepeptide is cleaved at a characteristic splice site (Pro--2 Arg--1 Ile-+1). Remarkably, the N-terminus of prenisin shares 70% similarity with preepidermin, although the propeptide sequences are distinctly different. The structural similarities between these two lantibiotics are consistent with the fact that there is a common mechanism of biosynthesis of these lanthionine-containing antibiotics.
TI  - Silver-coated nylon fiber as an antibacterial agent.
AB  - A blend of nylon fiber and silver-coated nylon fiber (the latter known as X-static) was used in these experiments. This fiber was bactericidal when bacteria were exposed to it directly or to an extract derived from its prior incubation in salt solution. At ambient temperatures, a rapid exponential decrease of survival occurred, usually after a delay of approximately 1 h. The rate of killing (decrease of survival) increased with an increase in X-static percentage of the fiber blend, temperature of fiber extraction, concentration of Tris buffer present during extraction, and temperature at which bacteria were exposed to the extract. When bacteria were exposed to the extract at 37 degrees C as opposed to ambient temperature, there was no delay in onset of killing. Escherichia coli was generally the indicator organism tested, but comparable results were also found for Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus species. The rate of killing increased with increasing silver ion concentration of the fiber extract, as determined through atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The rate of killing was greater and the onset was earlier with an extract containing silver ions from fiber than with a salt solution containing the same concentration of silver ions from silver nitrate. Studies of the kinetics of ion release suggested that X-static may be an effective, sustained-release antibacterial agent.
