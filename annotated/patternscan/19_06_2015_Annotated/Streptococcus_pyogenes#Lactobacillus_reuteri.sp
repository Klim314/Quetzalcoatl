TI  == crispr-cas9-assisted recombineering in lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (crisprs) and the crispr-associated (cas) nuclease protect bacteria and archeae from foreign dna by site-specific cleavage of incoming dna. type-ii crispr-cas systems, such as the streptococcus pyogenes crispr-cas9 system, can be adapted such that cas9 can be guided to a user-defined site in the chromosome to introduce double-stranded breaks. here we have developed and optimized crispr-cas9 function in the lactic acid bacterium lactobacillus reuteri atcc pta 6475. we established proof-of-concept showing that crispr-cas9 selection combined with single-stranded dna (ssdna) recombineering is a realistic approach to identify at high efficiencies edited cells in a lactic acid bacterium. we show for three independent targets that subtle changes in the bacterial genome can be recovered  at efficiencies ranging from 90 to 100%. by combining crispr-cas9 and recombineering, we successfully applied codon saturation mutagenesis in the l. reuteri chromosome. also, crispr-cas9 selection is critical to identify low-efficiency events such as oligonucleotide-mediated chromosome deletions. this also means that crispr-cas9 selection will allow identification of recombinant cells in bacteria with low recombineering efficiencies, eliminating the need for  ssdna recombineering optimization procedures. we envision that crispr-cas genome  editing has the potential to change the landscape of genome editing in lactic acid bacteria, and other gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == heat shock treatment increases the frequency of loss of an erythromycin resistance-encoding transposable element from the chromosome of lactobacillus crispatus chcc3692.
AB  == a 3,165-bp chromosomally integrated transposon, designatedtn3692, of the gram-positive strain lactobacillus crispatus chcc3692 contains an erm(b) gene conferring resistance to erythromycin at concentrations of up to 250 micrograms/ml. loss of this resistance can occur spontaneously, but the rate is substantially increased by heat shock treatment. heat shock treatment at 60 degrees c resulted in an almost 40-fold increase in the frequency of erythromycin-sensitive cells (erythromycin mic, 0.047 micrograms/ml). the phenotypic change was followed by a dramatic increase in transcription of the transposase gene and the concomitant loss of an approximately 2-kb dna fragment carrying the erm(b) gene from the 3,165-bp erm transposon. in cells that were not subjected to heat shock, transcription of the transposase gene was not detectable. the upstream sequence of the transposase gene did not show any homology to known heat shock promoters in the gene data bank. significant homology (>99%) was observed between the erythromycin resistance-encoding gene from l. crispatus chcc3692 and the erm(b) genes from other gram-positive bacteria, such as streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus  faecium, and lactobacillus reuteri, which strongly indicates a common origin of the erm(b) gene for these species. the transposed dna element was not translocated to other parts of the genome of chcc3692, as determining by southern blotting, pcr analysis, and dna sequencing. no other major aberrations were observed, as judged by colony morphology, growth performance of the strain, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. these observations suggest that heat shock treatment could be used as a tool for the removal of unwanted antibiotic resistance genes harbored in transposons flanked by insertion sequence elements or transposases in lactic acid bacteria used for animal and human food production.

TI  == ketolides: the future of the macrolides?
AB  == the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens associated with community-acquired respiratory tract infections is increasing. ketolides, semi-synthetic derivatives of erythromycin, overcome the macrolide resistance mechanisms found in streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes, two key  pathogens. they also have improved potency and longer post-antibiotic effects, while maintaining the antibacterial spectrum of the macrolide class. the new ketolides cethromycin (abt-773) and telithromycin have overall antibacterial properties that suggest they will be clinically useful new antibiotics and are undergoing clinical development and regulatory review.
