TI  == do atopobium vaginae, megasphaera sp. and leptotrichia sp. change the local innate immune response and sialidase activity in bacterial vaginosis?
AB  == objectives: to investigate if the participation of atopobium vaginae, megasphaera sp. and leptotrichia sp. in the bacterial community of bacterial vaginosis (bv) is associated with distinct patterns of this condition. methods: in this cross-sectional controlled study, 205 women with bv and 205 women with normal flora were included. vaginal rinsing samples were obtained for measuring the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and bacterial sialidases. real-time pcr was  used to quantify the bv-associated bacteria and to estimate the total bacterial load using the 16s rrna. principal component analysis (pca) using the measured parameters was performed to compare the bv samples with lower and higher loads of the species of interest. results: higher bacterial load (p<0.001), levels of interleukin 1-beta (p<0.001) and sialidase activity (p<0.001) were associated with bv. women with bv and higher relative loads of a vaginae, megasphaera sp. and leptotrichia sp. presented increased sialidase activity, but unchanged cytokine levels. pca analysis did not indicate a different pattern of bv according to the loads of a vaginae, megasphaera sp. and leptotrichia sp. conclusions: greater participation of a vaginae, megasphaera sp. and leptotrichia sp. in vaginal bacterial community did not indicate a less severe form of bv; moreover, it was associated with increased sialidase activity.

TI  == rapid characterization of the normal and disturbed vaginal microbiota by application of 16s rrna gene terminal rflp fingerprinting.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a prevalent infection in women of reproductive age associated with numerous sequelae, including preterm delivery, amniotic fluid infections and an increased risk of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases. the  vaginal microbiota in bv patients is characterized by a shift from lactobacilli to a diverse spectrum of mostly anaerobic bacteria. in this study, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) was used to characterize the vaginal bacterial communities from 50 women with bv and 20 healthy subjects. in the bv samples, 23 species or phylotypes from 17 genera could be identified, including atopobium vaginae, megasphaera sp., lactobacillus iners, gardnerella vaginalis and three recently described phylotypes from the order clostridiales. the number of detected species or phylotypes was on average 6.3 per sample (range 2-14). in contrast, in normal samples, only lactobacillus species could be identified. in conclusion, t-rflp provides a rapid and reliable technique to investigate the diversity of the predominant vaginal microbiota and allows differentiation of the flora of bv and healthy women. as such, t-rflp may be helpful both in the diagnosis of bv from vaginal fluids and in a better understanding of the bacterial succession involved in the aetiology of bv.
