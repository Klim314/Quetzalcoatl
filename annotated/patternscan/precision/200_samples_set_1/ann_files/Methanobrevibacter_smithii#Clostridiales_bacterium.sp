TI  == methanogen communities in stool of humans of different age and health status and  co-occurrence with bacteria.
AB  == hydrogenotrophic methanogens live in a synthrophic relationship with the human gut microbiota as the terminal part of the anaerobic food chain. methanobrevibacter smithii of the methanobacteriales is the prevailing archaeal species. recently, methylotrophic archaea of the novel order methanomassiliicoccales were isolated from human stool. little data exist on the  prevalence, abundance, persistence and ecology of these methanogens in humans. this study investigated methanogen communities in 26 healthy and obese children (8-14 years), and 18 adults (28-78 years) using quantitative pcr. from nine females, samples were obtained before and after giving birth. bacterial groups linked to the abundance of methanogens in adult females were identified using a 16s rrna gene amplicon dataset. 89 and 65% adults and children, respectively, carried methanobacteriales. methanomassiliicoccales were recovered from 50% of the adults and one child. mean relative abundance of methanomassiliicoccales in adults was lower than of methanobacteriales (0.10% vs. 0.52%). both methanobacteriales and methanomassiliicoccales formed stable communities in females before and after giving birth. methanobacteriales co-occurred with bacterial taxonomic groups associated with the trophic chain from carbohydrate degradation to hydrogen and formate formation. relative abundance was inversely correlated to blautia. negative correlation with little characterized groups within the clostridiales indicated possible interactions of methanomassiliicoccales with the bacterial community.

TI  == pan-genome of the dominant human gut-associated archaeon, methanobrevibacter smithii, studied in twins.
AB  == the human gut microbiota harbors three main groups of h(2)-consuming microbes: methanogens including the dominant archaeon, methanobrevibacter smithii, a polyphyletic group of acetogens, and sulfate-reducing bacteria. defining their roles in the gut is important for understanding how hydrogen metabolism affects the efficiency of fermentation of dietary components. we quantified methanogens in fecal samples from 40 healthy adult female monozygotic (mz) and 28 dizygotic (dz) twin pairs, analyzed bacterial 16s rrna datasets generated from their fecal  samples to identify taxa that co-occur with methanogens, sequenced the genomes of 20 m. smithii strains isolated from families of mz and dz twins, and performed rna-seq of a subset of strains to identify their responses to varied formate concentrations. the concordance rate for methanogen carriage was significantly higher for mz versus dz twin pairs. co-occurrence analysis revealed 22 bacterial  species-level taxa positively correlated with methanogens: all but two were members of the clostridiales, with several being, or related to, known hydrogen-producing and -consuming bacteria. the m. smithii pan-genome contains 987 genes conserved in all strains, and 1,860 variably represented genes. strains from mz and dz twin pairs had a similar degree of shared genes and snps, and were significantly more similar than strains isolated from mothers or members of other families. the 101 adhesin-like proteins (alps) in the pan-genome (45 +/- 6 per strain) exhibit strain-specific differences in expression and responsiveness to formate. we hypothesize that m. smithii strains use their different repertoires of alps to create diversity in their metabolic niches, by allowing them to establish syntrophic relationships with bacterial partners with differing metabolic capabilities and patterns of co-occurrence.
