TI  == altered microbiota associated with abnormal humoral immune responses to commensal organisms in enthesitis-related arthritis.
AB  == introduction: prior studies have established altered microbiota and immunologic reactivity to enteric commensal organisms in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). since intestinal inflammation is present in a subset of patients with both pediatric and adult spondyloarthritis (spa), we hypothesized that spa patients may also have altered microbiota and immune responsiveness to enteric organisms.  methods: stool and blood specimens were collected from children with enthesitis-related arthritis (era) and non-inflammatory controls. dna purified from stool was subject to pcr amplification and sequencing of the variable iv region from the 16s rdna gene. iga and igg enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisas) were performed on select species of bacteria in most subjects. results:  twenty-five children with era and 13 controls were included. the era patients had less faecalibacterium prausnitzii (3.8% versus 10%, p = 0.008) and lachnospiraceae family (12 versus 7.0%, p = 0.020), a statistically significant increase in bifidobacterium (1.8% versus 0%, p = 0.032) and a non-statistically significant increase in bacteroides (21% versus 11%, p = 0.150). akkermansia muciniphila was abundant (>2%) in 7/27 era patients but none of the controls (p = 0.072.) cluster analysis revealed two clusters of era patients: cluster one (n =  8) was characterized by high levels of bacteroides genus, while a second (n = 15) cluster had similar levels as the controls. seven of 17 (41%) of the era subjects in cluster 2 compared to 0/8 of the subjects in cluster 1 had abundant akkermansia muciniphila (p = 0.057). serum iga and igg antibody levels against f. prausnitzii and b. fragilis were similar between patients and controls, whereas the two groups showed divergent responses when the fecal relative abundances of f. prausnitzii and bacteroides were compared individually against iga antibody levels recognizing f. prausnitzii and b. fragilis, respectively. conclusion: the  abundance of f. prausnitzii in the stool among patients with era is reduced compared to controls, and bacteroides and a. muciniphila are identified as associative agents in subsets of era patients. differences in the humoral responses to these bacteria may contribute to disease.

TI  == association of dietary type with fecal microbiota in vegetarians and omnivores in slovenia.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this study was to discover differences in the human fecal microbiota composition driven by long-term omnivore versus vegan/lacto-vegetarian dietary pattern. in addition, the possible association of demographic characteristics and dietary habits such as consumption of particular foods with the fecal microbiota was examined. methods: this study was conducted on a slovenian population comprising 31 vegetarian participants (11 lacto-vegetarians  and 20 vegans) and 29 omnivore participants. bacterial dna was extracted from the frozen fecal samples by maxwell 16 tissue dna purification kit (promega). relative quantification of selected bacterial groups was performed by real-time pcr. differences in fecal microbiota composition were evaluated by pcr-dgge fingerprinting of the v3 16s rrna region. participants' demographic characteristics, dietary habits and health status information were collected through a questionnaire. results: vegetarian diet was associated with higher ratio (% of group-specific dna in relation to all bacterial dna) of bacteroides-prevotella, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, clostridium clostridioforme and faecalibacterium prausnitzii, but with lower ratio (%) of clostridium cluster xiva. real-time pcr also showed a higher concentration and ratio of enterobacteriaceae (16s rdna copies/g and %) in female participants (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01) and decrease in bifidobacterium with age (p < 0.01). dgge analysis of the 16s rrna v3 region showed that relative quantity of dgge bands from certain bacterial groups was lower (bifidobacterium, streptococus, collinsella and lachnospiraceae) or higher (subdoligranulum) among vegetarians, indicating the association of dietary type with bacterial community composition. sequencing of selected dgge bands revealed the presence of common representatives of fecal microbiota: bacteroides, eubacterium, faecalibacterium, ruminococcaceae, bifidobacterium and lachnospiraceae. up to 4 % of variance in microbial community analyzed by dgge could be explained by the vegetarian type of diet. conclusions:  long-term vegetarian diet contributed to quantity and associated bacterial community shifts in fecal microbiota composition. consumption of foods of animal  origin (eggs, red meat, white meat, milk, yoghurt, other dairy products, fish and seafood) and vegetarian type of diet explained the largest share of variance in microbial community structure. fecal microbiota composition was also associated with participants' age, gender and body mass.

TI  == temporal bacterial community dynamics vary among ulcerative colitis patients after fecal microbiota transplantation.
AB  == objectives: fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) from healthy donors, which is  an effective alternative for treatment of clostridium difficile-associated disease, is being considered for several disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and metabolic syndrome. disease remission upon fmt is thought to be facilitated by an efficient colonization of healthy donor microbiota, but knowledge of the composition and temporal stability of patient microbiota after fmt is lacking. methods: five patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (mayo score >/=6) and refractory to standard therapy received fmt via nasojejunal tube and enema. in addition to clinical activity and adverse events, the patients' fecal bacterial communities were monitored at multiple time points for up to 12 weeks using 16s rrna gene-targeted pyrosequencing. results: fmt elicited fever and a temporary increase of c-reactive protein. abundant bacteria from donors established in recipients, but  the efficiency and stability of donor microbiota colonization varied greatly. a positive clinical response was observed after 12 weeks in one patient whose microbiota had been effectively augmented by fmt. this augmentation was marked by successive colonization of donor-derived phylotypes including the anti-inflammatory and/or short-chain fatty acid-producing faecalibacterium prausnitzii, rosebura faecis, and bacteroides ovatus. disease severity (as measured by the mayo score) was associated with an overrepresentation of enterobacteriaceae and an underrepresentation of lachnospiraceae. conclusions: this study highlights the value of characterizing temporally resolved microbiota  dynamics for a better understanding of fmt efficacy and provides potentially useful diagnostic indicators for monitoring fmt success in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

TI  == prebiotic stimulation of human colonic butyrate-producing bacteria and bifidobacteria, in vitro.
AB  == dietary macronutrients affect the composition of the gut microbiota, and prebiotics are used to improve and maintain a healthy gut. the impact of prebiotics on dominant gut bacteria other than bifidobacteria, however, is under-researched. here, we report carbohydrate utilisation patterns for representative butyrate-producing anaerobes, belonging to the gram-positive firmicutes families lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae, by comparison with selected bacteroides and bifidobacterium species. growth assessments using anaerobic hungate tubes and a new rapid microtitre plate assay were generally in  good agreement. the bacteroides strains tested showed some growth on basal medium with no added carbohydrates, utilising peptides in the growth medium. the butyrate-producing strains exhibited different growth profiles on the substrates, which included starch, inulin, fructooligosaccharides (fos), galactooligosaccharides (gos) and xylooligosaccharides (xos). eleven were able to grow on short-chain fos, but this number decreased as the chain length of the fructan substrates increased. long-chain inulin was utilised by roseburia inulinivorans, but by none of the bifidobacterium species examined here. xos was  a more selective growth substrate than fos, with only six of the 11 firmicutes strains able to use xos for growth. these results illustrate the selectivity of different prebiotics and help to explain why some are butyrogenic.

TI  == identification and characterization of potential performance-related gut microbiotas in broiler chickens across various feeding trials.
AB  == three broiler feeding trials were investigated in order to identify gut bacteria  consistently linked with improvements in bird performance as measured by feed efficiency. trials were done in various geographic locations and varied in diet composition, broiler breed, and bird age. gut microbial communities were investigated using microbial profiling. eight common performance-linked operational taxonomic units (otus) were identified within both the ilea (180, 492, and 564-566) and ceca (140-142, 218-220, 284-286, 312, and 482) across trials. otu 564-566 was associated with lower performance, while otus 140-142, 482, and 492 were associated with improved performance. targeted cloning and sequencing of these eight otus revealed that they represented 26 bacterial species or phylotypes which clustered phylogenetically into seven groups related  to lactobacillus spp., ruminococcaceae, clostridiales, gammaproteobacteria, bacteroidales, clostridiales/lachnospiraceae, and unclassified bacteria/clostridia. where bacteria were identifiable to the phylum level, they belonged predominantly to the firmicutes, with bacteroidetes and proteobacteria also identified. some of the potential performance-related phylotypes showed high sequence identity with classified bacteria (lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus aviarius, lactobacillus crispatus, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, escherichia coli, gallibacterium anatis, clostridium lactatifermentans, ruminococcus torques, bacteroides vulgatus, and alistipes finegoldii). the 16s rrna gene sequence information generated will allow quantitative assays to be developed which will enable elucidations of which of these phylotypes are truly performance related. this information could be used to monitor strategies to improve feed efficiency and feed formulation for optimal gut health.

TI  == diversity of the autochthonous colonic microbiota.
AB  == a longstanding hypothesis in intestinal microbial ecology is that autochthonous microbes (resident) play a role that is distinct from allochthonous microbes (transient microbes in the fecal stream). a challenge has been to identify this pool of microbes. we used laser capture microdissection to collect microbes from  the mouse ascending colon. this area contains transverse folds that mimic human intestinal folds and contains a distinct population of intestinal microbes that is associated with the mucosa. our analysis of bacterial 16s rrna genes showed that this area was enriched for lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae. in this addendum, we further compare this community to studies of mucosa-associated microbes in humans. this analysis reveals common phylogenetic groups of bacteria  that are present in both mouse and human. however, we found microorganisms at the genus and species levels including faecalibacterium prausnitzii which appears to  be specific for humans. we propose that that examination of the mucosa-associated microbes in wild type and genetically modified mice will be a valuable component  to define host microbial interactions that are essential for homeostasis.
