TI  == comparative in vitro activities of abt-773 against 362 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of abt-773, a novel ketolide antibiotic, against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined and compared to the activities of other antimicrobial agents. mics at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=0.06 microg/ml for actinomyces spp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus spp., propionibacterium spp., and porphyromonas spp. the mic(50)s and mic(90)s were </=0.06 and >32 microg/ml, respectively, for eubacterium spp., lactobacillus spp., clostridium difficile, and clostridium ramosum. the mic(90) for bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides ureolyticus, and campylobacter gracilis was 1 microg/ml, and that for prevotella bivia and other prevotella spp. was 0.5 microg/ml. the mic(90) for fusobacterium nucleatum was 8  microg/ml, and that for fusobacterium mortiferum and fusobacterium varium was >32 microg/ml. the mic(90)s for the bacteroides fragilis group were as follows: for b. fragilis, 8 microg/ml; for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides distasonis, and bacteroides uniformis, >32 microg/ml; and for bacteroides vulgatus, 4 microg/ml. telithromycin mics for the b. fragilis group were usually 1 to 2 dilutions higher than abt-773 mics. for all strains, abt-773  was more active than erythromycin by 4 or more dilutions, and for some strains this drug was more active than clindamycin.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin (sb 265805) against anaerobes.
AB  == gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805), a new fluoronaphthyridone, was tested against  359 recent clinical anaerobic isolates by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards reference agar dilution method with supplemented brucella blood agar and an inoculum of 10(5) cfu/spot. comparative antimicrobials tested included trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, sparfloxacin, sitafloxacin (du-6859a), penicillin g, amoxicillin clavulanate, imipenem, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole. the mic(50) and mic(90) (mics at which 50 and 90% of the isolates were inhibited) of gemifloxacin against various organisms (with the number of strains tested in parentheses) were as follows (in micrograms per milliliter): for bacteroides fragilis (28), 0.5 and 2; for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (24), 1 and 16; for bacteroides caccae (12), 1 and 16; for bacteroides distasonis (12), 8 and >16; for bacteroides ovatus (12), 4 and >16; for bacteroides stercoris (12), 0.5 and 0.5; for bacteroides uniformis (12), 1 and 4; for bacteroides vulgatus (11), 4 and 4; for clostridium clostridioforme (15), 0.5 and 0.5; for clostridium difficile (15), 1 and >16; for clostridium innocuum (13), 0.125 and 2; for clostridium perfringens (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for  clostridium ramosum (14), 0.25 and 8; for fusobacterium nucleatum (12), 0.125 and 0.25; for fusobacterium necrophorum (11), 0.25 and 0.5; for fusobacterium varium  (13), 0.5 and 1; for fusobacterium spp. (12), 1 and 2; for peptostreptococcus anaerobius (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (13), 0.125 and 0.125; for peptostreptococcus magnus (14), 0.03 and 0.03; for peptostreptococcus micros (12), 0.06 and 0.06; for peptostreptococcus prevotii (14), 0.06 and 0.25; for porphyromonas asaccharolytica (11), 0.125 and 0.125; for prevotella bivia (10), 8 and 16; for prevotella buccae (10), 2 and 2; for prevotella intermedia (10), 0.5 and 0.5; and for prevotella melaninogenica (11),  1 and 1. gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805) was 1 to 4 dilutions more active than  trovafloxacin against fusobacteria and peptostreptococci, and the two drugs were  equivalent against clostridia and p. asaccharolytica. gemifloxacin was equivalent to sitafloxacin (du 6859a) against peptostreptococci, c. perfringens, and c. ramosum, and sitafloxacin was 2 to 3 dilutions more active against fusobacteria.  sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, and levofloxacin were generally less active than gemifloxacin against all anaerobes.

TI  == comparative in-vitro and in-vivo activity of am-1155 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of am-1155, a 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone, was compared with those of temafloxacin, sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin  and cefmetazole, a cephamycin, against a variety of anaerobic bacteria. although  am-1155 demonstrated only modest activity against the bacteroides fragilis group  and prevotella bivia (mic90s > or =3.13 mg/ml), 76% of the b. fragilis strains tested were inhibited at am-1155 concentrations of 0.78 mg/l. am-1155 was highly  active against prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium spp., clostridium perfringens and mobiluncus spp. (mic90s < or =0.39 mg/l). an in-vivo study using a mixed infection with am-1155- and tosufloxacin-susceptible  b. fragilis and escherichia coli strains in rat granuloma pouch was performed. am-1155 was effective against both organisms whereas tosufloxacin was effective only against e. coli. these results correlated well to the higher pouch levels of am-1155 than those of tosufloxacin. clostridium difficile overgrowth was found in the caecum of mice treated with ampicillin both 1 and 7 days after 5 days dosing, but not in am-1155-treated mice. these results suggest that the clinical efficacy of am-1155 against infections involving most anaerobic bacteria except for the b. fragilis group and p. bivia should be evaluated further.

TI  == comparison of activities of trovafloxacin (cp-99,219) and five other agents against 585 anaerobes with use of three media.
AB  == agar dilution testing was used to compare the in vitro activities of trovafloxacin and ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, metronidazole, and clindamycin against 585 anaerobes. the activity of trovafloxacin was superior to  those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, with 94%, 91%, 96%, 100%, 90%, and 100% inhibition of bacteroides fragilis, non-fragilis bacteroides species, peptostreptococcus magnus/peptostreptococcus micros, clostridium perfringens, prevotella bivia/prevotella disiens, and fusobacterium species, respectively, at  a breakpoint of 2 micrograms/ml. trovafloxacin was more active than clindamycin against most anaerobes and slightly less active than imipenem and metronidazole.  different testing media, which were compared side by side, did affect the in vitro activities of trovafloxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin but did not affect those of the other antibiotics. testing with supplemented brain-heart infusion agar demonstrated lower minimum inhibitory concentrations than did testing with wilkins-chalgren agar and supplemented brucella agar. the activity of trovafloxacin was twofold lower when the ph of the testing media was adjusted  to 6.0 than when the ph of the testing media was adjusted to 7.0 or 7.5.

TI  == in vitro activity of meropenem compared with imipenem, metronidazole, ampicillin, and ampicillin/sulbactam against anaerobes.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to compare the in vitro activity of meropenem (ici 194660, cas 96036-03-2) with imipenem, metronidazole, clindamycin, ampicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam against a variety of anaerobic bacteria using an agar dilution method. 423 clinical isolates were tested belonging to 70 species of 15 anaerobic genera. they included bacteroides fragilis (n = 62), bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (n = 45), prevotella bivia (n = 11), fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 12), clostridium perfringens (n = 15) and several rarely isolated  species and genera, e.g. selenomonas sputigena and clostridium symbiosum. bacteroides species were inhibited by meropenem at < or = 2.0 micrograms/ml, clostridium species, including c. difficile, at < or = 4.0 micrograms/ml and all  the other anaerobes at < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. meropenem and imipenem were the most active substances, but often equal to, or only slightly better than, metronidazole, clindamycin or ampicillin/sulbactam, dependent on species. meropenem was especially active against bacteroides gracilis (mic90 0.015 microgram/ml), prevotella disiens (mic90 0.03 microgram/ml), fusobacterium nucleatum (mic90 0.015 microgram/ml), clostridium perfringens (mic90 0.015 microgram/ml) and veillonella parvula (mic90 0.03 microgram/ml). the results obtained indicate that meropenem might be a useful adjunct to chemotherapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections.

TI  == patterns of susceptibility to fluoroquinolones among anaerobic bacterial isolates in the united states.
AB  == the activity of the fluoroquinolone antibiotics against anaerobic bacteria has generally been moderate to poor. nalidixic acid and cinoxacin show poor activity  against almost all anaerobes. norfloxacin and enoxacin exhibit poor anaerobic activity (mic90, 8- > 256 micrograms/ml) except against clostridium perfringens,  bacteroides ureolyticus, and some eubacteria. norfloxacin is slightly more active than enoxacin against some bacteroides species. while ciprofloxacin is more active than earlier fluoroquinolones against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis (mic90, 4-16 micrograms/ml), fusobacteria, and peptostreptococci, its activity is often variable and its mic90 is frequently close to the maximal level attainable in serum. ofloxacin is active against b. fragilis (mic90, 4-8 micrograms/ml) but not against other species of the b. fragilis group (mic90, 8-32 micrograms/ml); other anaerobes (e.g., peptostreptococci and fusobacteria) are generally susceptible to < or = 8 micrograms of ofloxacin/ml. several newer quinolones exhibit improved anaerobic activity (although the studies yielding relevant data have often used diverse methods, small numbers and varieties of isolates, and different breakpoints). ci-960 and win 57273 inhibit 95% of strains tested at < or = 2 micrograms/ml. ci-990, sparfloxacin, and temafloxacin inhibit  most anaerobes at < or = 2 micrograms/ml, but clustering around the breakpoint and strain variability have been noted. ci-990 is active against more than 85% of b. fragilis strains (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), but other species of the b. fragilis group often require > 4 micrograms/ml for inhibition; prevotella bivia,  fusobacterium varium, and fusobacterium ulcerans are usually resistant.(abstract  truncated at 250 words)
