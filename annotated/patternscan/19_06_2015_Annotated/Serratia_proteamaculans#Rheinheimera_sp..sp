TI  == gallaecimonas pentaromativorans gen. nov., sp. nov., a bacterium carrying 16s rrna gene heterogeneity and able to degrade high-molecular-mass polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
AB  == a gram-negative, rod-shaped, halotolerant bacterium, designated strain cee_131(t), which degraded high-molecular-mass polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons of four and five rings, was isolated from intertidal sediment of corcubion ria in cee, a coruna, spain. direct sequencing showed ambiguities and suggested heterogeneity. cloned 16s rrna gene sequence pcr products yielded five different  sequences varying at five positions. strain cee_131(t) showed rather distant relationships to its phylogenetically closest neighbours, including the genera rheinheimera and serratia , exhibiting 91 % sequence similarity with rheinheimera perlucida ba131(t) and serratia proteamaculans subsp. quinovora dsm 4597(t). the  major fatty acids were c(16 : 1 )omega7c, c(16 : 0) and c(18 : 1)omega7c. the dna g+c content was 41.7 mol%. on the basis of these distinct phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, strain cee_131(t) is considered to represent a novel species in a new genus in the class gammaproteobacteria, for which the name gallaecimonas pentaromativorans gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain  is cee_131(t) (=dsm 21945(t)=cect 7479(t)).
