TI  == identifying gene clusters within localized regions in multiple genomes.
AB  == an important strategy to study genome evolution is to investigate the clustering  of orthologous genes among multiple genomes, in which the most popular approaches require that the distance between adjacent genes in a cluster be small. we investigate a different formulation based on constraining the overall size of a cluster and develop statistical significance estimates that allow direct comparison of clusters of different sizes. we first consider a restricted version which requires that orthologous genes are strictly ordered within each cluster and show that it can be solved in polynomial time. we then develop practical exact algorithms for the unrestricted problem that allows paralogous genes within a genome and clusters that may not appear in every genome while considering a general model in which a gene is allowed to appear in more than one orthologous group. we show that our algorithm can identify biologically relevant gene clusters on four bacterial genomes bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, and clostridium acetobutylicum. we also show that our algorithm can identify significantly more functionally enriched gene clusters on  four yeast genomes saccharomyces cerevisiae, saccharomyces paradoxus, saccharomyces mikatae, and saccharomyces bayanus than previous algorithms. a software program (gcfinder) and a list of gene clusters found on the bacterial and the yeast genomes are available at http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/shsze/gcfinder .

TI  == comparative analysis of gene expression among low g+c gram-positive genomes.
AB  == we present a comparative analysis of predicted highly expressed (phx) genes in the low g+c gram-positive genomes of bacillus subtilis, bacillus halodurans, listeria monocytogenes, listeria innocua, lactococcus lactis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium acetobutylicum, and clostridium perfringens. most enzymes acting in glycolysis and fermentation pathways are phx in these genomes, but not those involved in the tca cycle and respiration, suggesting that these organisms have predominantly adapted to grow rapidly in an anaerobic environment. only b. subtilis and b. halodurans have several tca cycle phx genes, whereas the tca pathway is entirely  missing from the metabolic repertoire of the two streptococcus species and is incomplete in listeria, lactococcus, and clostridium. pyruvate-formate lyase, an  enzyme critical in mixed acid fermentation, is among the highest phx genes in all these genomes except for c. acetobutylicum (not phx), and b. subtilis, and b. halodurans (missing). pyruvate-formate lyase is also prominently phx in enteric gamma-proteobacteria, but not in other prokaryotes. phosphotransferase system genes are generally phx with selection of different substrates in different genomes. the various substrate specificities among phosphotransferase systems in  different genomes apparently reflect on differences in habitat, lifestyle, and nutrient sources.

TI  == clpe, a novel type of hsp100 atpase, is part of the ctsr heat shock regulon of bacillus subtilis.
AB  == clp atpases, which include the ubiquitous hsp100 family, are classified according to their structural features and sequence similarities. during the course of the  bacillus subtilis genome sequencing project, we identified a gene encoding a new  member of the hsp100 family. we designated this protein clpe, as it is the prototype of a novel subfamily among the clp atpases, and have identified homologues in several bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, lactobacillus sakei and clostridium acetobutylicum. a unique feature of these hsp100-type clp atpases is their amino-terminal zinc finger motif. unlike the other class iii genes of b. subtilis (clpc and clpp ), clpe does not appear to be required for stress tolerance. transcriptional analysis revealed two sigmaa-type promoters, expression from which was shown to be inducible by heat shock and puromycin treatment. investigation of the regulatory mechanism controlling clpe expression  indicates that this gene is controlled by ctsr and is thus a member of the class  iii heat shock genes of b. subtilis. ctsr negatively regulates clpe expression by binding to the promoter region, in which five ctsr binding sites were identified  through dnase i footprinting and sequence analysis.

TI  == ctsr, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == clpp and clpc of bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the clp atp-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. they play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the  so-called class iii group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. the product of ctsr, the first gene of the clpc operon, has now been  shown to act as a repressor of both clpp and clpc, as well as clpe, which encodes a novel member of the hsp100 clp atpase family. the ctsr protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. random mutagenesis, dnasel footprinting and dna sequence deletions and comparisons were  used to define a consensus ctsr recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. this target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several gram-positive bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus salivarius, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, leuconostoc oenos, lactobacillus sake, lactococcus lactis and clostridium acetobutylicum. ctsr homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by ctsr is highly conserved in gram-positive bacteria.
