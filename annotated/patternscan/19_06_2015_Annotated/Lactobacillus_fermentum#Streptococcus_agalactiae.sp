TI  == effectiveness of the two microorganisms lactobacillus fermentum lf15 and lactobacillus plantarum lp01, formulated in slow-release vaginal tablets, in women affected by bacterial vaginosis: a pilot study.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common reason for abnormal vaginal discharge in reproductive-age women and one of its most important causative agents is the gram-variable bacterium gardnerella vaginalis. bv is not  accompanied by significant local inflammation, whereas the "fishy odor" test is always positive. in contrast, aerobic vaginitis (av) is predominantly associated  with escherichia coli, but streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus are also involved. standard treatment of bv consists of oral or intravaginal antibiotics, although these are unable to spontaneously restore normal flora characterized by a high concentration of lactobacilli. the main limitation is the inability to offer a long-term defensive barrier, thus facilitating relapses and  recurrences. this study was undertaken firstly to assess the ability of selected  lactobacilli to in vitro antagonize g. vaginalis to determine an association with a strain able to inhibit e. coli, thus identifying a possible use in av. the second step of the study was to conduct a human pilot trial in women affected by  bv using an association of the most promising and active bacteria. materials and  methods: for this purpose, neutralized supernatants of individual lactobacilli were tested at percentages ranging from 0.5% to 4% to determine their ability to  hinder the growth of g. vaginalis american type culture collection 10231. the bacterium that was able to exert the strongest inhibition was subsequently tested with lactobacillus plantarum lp01 in a human intervention, placebo-controlled, pilot trial involving 34 female subjects (aged between 18 and 50, mean 34.7+/-8.9, no menopausal women) diagnosed with bv. the 2 microorganisms lactobacillus fermentum lf15 (dsm 26955) and l. plantarum lp01 (lmg p-21021) were delivered to the vagina by means of slow-release vaginal tablets, also containing 50 mg of tara gum. the amount of each strain was 400 million live cells per dose. the women were instructed to apply a vaginal tablet once a day for 7 consecutive  nights, followed by 1 tablet every 3 nights for a further 3-week application (acute phase) and, finally, 1 tablet per week to maintain a long-term vaginal colonization against possible recurrences. a clinical examination was performed and the nugent score was quantified for each patient at enrollment (d0), after 28 days (d28), and at the end of the second month of relapse prevention (d56). a statistical comparison was made between d28, or d56, and d0, and between d56 and  d28 to quantify the efficacy against possible recurrences. results: l. fermentum  lf15 showed the strongest in vitro inhibitory activity towards g. vaginalis american type culture collection (atcc) 10231 after both 24 and 48 hours. in the  human trial, the 2 lactobacilli selected, namely l. fermentum lf15 and l. plantarum lp01, significantly reduced the nugent score below the threshold of 7 after 28 days in 22 patients of 24 in the active group (91.7%, p<0.001). eight women (33.3%) recorded a nugent score between 4 and 6, evidence of an intermediate situation, whereas the remaining 14 (58.3%) showed a score <4, therefore suggesting the restoration of physiological vaginal microbiota. at the  end of the second month, only 4 women registered a nugent score >7, definable as  bv (16.7%, p=0.065 compared with d28). in the placebo group, no significant differences were recorded at any time. conclusions: bv, also known as vaginal bacteriosis is the most common cause of vaginal infection in women of childbearing age. furthermore, bv is often asymptomatic as about 50% of women with this condition have no symptoms at all and the prevalence rate in apparently healthy women is around 10%. this study suggests the ability of the 2 strains l.  fermentum lf15 and l. plantarum lp01 to counteract acute gardnerella infections effectively and significantly improve the related uncomfortable symptoms in a very high percentage of women. this could be partially attributed to the presence of tara gum, which is able to create a mechanical barrier against gardnerella on  the surface of vaginal mucosa as a primary mechanism. furthermore, long-term physiological protection seems to be established, thanks to the integration of the 2 lactobacilli into the vaginal microbiota and to their adhesion to the epithelial cells of the mucosa. in the light of the additional in vitro inhibitory activity against e. coli, their prospective use in av could also prove interesting.

TI  == effect of two probiotic strains of lactobacillus on in vitro adherence of listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococcus aureus to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  == the lactobacilli probiotics maintain a normal vaginal biota and prevent disease recurrence. this microorganisms form a pellicle on the vaginal epithelium that acts as a biologic barrier against colonization by pathogenic bacteria. in this paper were realized assays of exclusion, competition, and displacement. for these test, vaginal epithelial cells, two strains of lactobacilli and pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae and listeria monocytogenes) were used. the lactobacilli strains showed a great capacity of adherence, with a mean of 83.5 +/- 26.67 lactobacillus fermentum cells and 56.2 +/- 20.87 lactobacillus rhamnosus cells per vaginal epithelial cells. l. fermentum and l. rhamnosus were able to reduce the adherence of s. aureus, s. agalactiae and l. monocytogenes in a significant level in this assay (p < 0.01).  the lactobacilli used in this study protect the vaginal epithelium through a series of barriers and interference mechanisms. the aim of present study was to assess the ability of vaginal lactobacillus strains, selected for their probiotic properties, to block the adherence of pathogenic microorganisms in vitro by displacement, competition, and exclusion mechanisms.

TI  == detection and partial characterization of a bacteriocin-like substance produced by lactobacillus fermentum cs57 isolated from human vaginal secretions.
AB  == lactobacilli (150) from human vaginal secretions were tested for the production of antimicrobial substances which can provide a physiological defense against the pathogenic microorganisms in the vaginal area. sixteen of the isolates (10.6%) showed antibacterial activity against one or several closely related microorganisms used as indicators. lactobacillus fermentum cs57 was the best producer and secretes a bacteriocin-like substance (bls) with antagonistic activity against streptococcus agalactiae and candida albicans. the compound was  susceptible to the proteolytic enzymes and was heat labile. the mode of action was identified as bactericidal. the crude activity of the l. fermentum cs57 bls was linked to a substance with a molecular weight larger than 30 kda. plasmid analysis of l. fermentum cs57 revealed the presence of a plasmid band with molecular weight of 54.7 kb. all l. fermentum cs57 non-producer variants (bls-) obtained by curing experiments, showed loss of plasmid band and were susceptible  to the bls of the original strain. therefore antimicrobial activity and immunity  production seem to be linked to genes located on that same plasmid. taking into account our results, l. fermentum cs57 could be considered a candidate for potential use as probiotic for the prophylaxis of vaginal human infections.

TI  == investigation of vaginal microbiota in sexually active women using hormonal contraceptives in pakistan.
AB  == background: previous studies report association of contraceptives with moderate increase in urinary tract infection among sexually active premenopausal women. the aim of our study was to find out whether the use of hormonal contraceptives has any effect on microbiota of the vagina in the contraceptives users in khairpur sindh pakistan. methods: a prospective study in woman population of khairpur sindh pakistan aged 20-30 years and 31-40 years, using hormonal contraceptives was carried out. high vaginal swab samples (n = 100) were collected from the test populations as well as control group (n = 100) and investigated for vaginal microbial flora using standard microbiological and biochemical techniques. results: vaginal swabs culturing from hormonal contraceptives users in the age group 20-30 years showed statistically insignificant candida sp (10% samples), and statistically significant (p < 0.05)  staphylococcus saprophyticus. (18% samples), streptococcus agalactiae (23% samples), escherichia coli (28% samples) and lactobacillus fermentum (32% samples). in the age group 31-40 years, statistically significant percentage of samples (p < 0.05) showed lactobacillus fermentum (28%), candida sp (24%), and e. coli, (24%) where statistically insignificant samples showed staphylococcus saprophyticus (13%) and streptococcus agalactiae (11%). conclusions: the use of hormonal contraceptives alters the normal microbiota of vagina in women according to the age. lactobacillus fermentum appeared as the predominant species followed  by e. coli among the age group of 20-30 years and, lactobacillus fermentum, candida sp and e. coli as predominant among women of age group 31-40 years when compared to corresponding control groups. an inverse relationship between e. coli and lactobacillus fermentum was observed in the women aged 20-30 years.

TI  == synergistic effect between two bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances produced by lactobacilli strains with inhibitory activity for streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  == group b streptococci (gbs) are bacterial species that colonize the vagina in pregnant women and as such may cause serious infections in neonates that passed through the birth channel. the objective of this work was to study the inhibitory activities produced by each bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (blis) of lactobacillus rhamnosus l60 and lactobacillus fermentum l23, and the effects of the combined blis-es of these lactobacilli on gbs. the interactions between the blis-es were assessed by qualitative and quantitative methods on agar plates. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and fractional inhibitory concentrations (fics) were determined by a modification of the broth microdilution and checkerboard methods, respectively. antibiotic susceptibilities of all s. agalactiae strains were assayed and the results of these tests were evaluated for statistical significance. a 7.5% of gbs isolates were recovered from 760 pregnant women and 91% of those strains were susceptible to each blis produced by l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and also to a mixture of them. the comparisons among the blis-es showed statistically significant differences, with a combination of the blis-es from the two lactobacillus species being better than the blis of each one alone (p < 0.05) as gbs growth inhibitors. synergistic activities between the blis-es were found on 100% of susceptible gbs strains, mics ranges of blis of l23 and l60 were 80-160 and 160-320 ua ml(-1), respectively. by the checkerboard method, the blis-es combination showed synergistic effect on all sensitive strains tested, with values of fics ranging from 0.131 to 0.218. the blis-es produced by these lactobacilli of vaginal origin were able to inhibit s. agalactiae isolates. the results indicate that these strains may have probiotic potential for the control of gbs in women and may consequently prevent gbs infections in newborns.

TI  == nucleic acid-based diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and improved management using probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common condition in women that represents an imbalance of the vaginal microflora, lactobacilli depletion, and excess growth of mainly anaerobic gram-negative pathogens. diagnosis is made using a series of tests or a gram stain of a vaginal smear. treatment with antibiotics is quite effective, but recurrences are common. a study of 55 vaginal samples from 11 postmenopausal women showed the presence of bv by the gram stain-based nugent scoring system, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that bacteroides or prevotella species were the most common isolates recovered (24 of 25), with escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae also found in some samples. in one case, only gardnerella vaginalis was found. these findings illustrate that bv remains common even among otherwise healthy women, but it is not caused solely by either  gardnerella or mobiluncus. use of a femexam system (cooper surgical, shelton, ct), based upon elevated ph and trimethylamine levels, to screen vaginal smears from 59 healthy women showed poor correlation with the gram stain method. a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of these subjects showed that the lactobacilli-dominant microbiota was restored in subjects with bv but not in controls, following 2 months of daily oral intake of lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14. these studies show that nucleic acid-based methods are effective at identifying bacteria responsible for bv. if such methods could be used to develop a commercially available, self-use kit, women would be much better placed to take control of their own health, for example, using medicinal food or dietary supplement products such as the clinically proven probiotic strains l. rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14.

TI  == identification and characterization of the novel lysm domain-containing surface protein sep from lactobacillus fermentum br11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in lactobacillus and lactococcus.
AB  == examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of lactobacillus fermentum br11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kda  protein termed sep. the amino-terminal sequence of sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of lactobacillus reuteri, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and lactobacillus plantarum. the carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) surface proteins of lactobacillus gasseri and  lactobacillus johnsonii. the mature amino terminus of sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding lysm domain, thereby making it distinct from apf proteins.  we have identified a common motif within lysm domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding yg motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in l. fermentum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactococcus lactis mg1363. modified sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and l. lactis hosts. sep as well as the previously described surface protein bspa were used to express and secrete in l.  fermentum or l. rhamnosus a fragment of human e-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for listeria monocytogenes. this study demonstrates that sep has  potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == peptide surface display and secretion using two lpxtg-containing surface proteins from lactobacillus fermentum br11.
AB  == a locus encoding two repetitive proteins that have lpxtg cell wall anchoring signals from lactobacillus fermentum br11 has been identified by using an antiserum raised against whole l. fermentum br11 cells. the first protein, rlp, is similar to the rib surface protein from streptococcus agalactiae, while the other protein, mlp, is similar to the mucus binding protein mub from lactobacillus reuteri. it was shown that multiple copies of mlp exist in the genome of l. fermentum br11. regions of rlp, mlp, and the previously characterized surface protein bspa were used to surface display or secrete heterologous peptides in l. fermentum. the peptides tested were 10 amino acids of the human cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator protein and a six-histidine epitope (his(6)). the bspa promoter and secretion signal were used in combination with the rlp cell wall sorting signal to express, export, and covalently anchor the heterologous peptides to the cell wall. detection of the cell surface protein fusions revealed that rlp was a significantly better surface display vector than  bspa despite having lower cellular levels (0.7 mg per liter for the rlp fusion compared with 4 mg per liter for the bspa fusion). the mlp promoter and encoded secretion signal were used to express and export large (328-kda at 10 mg per liter) and small (27-kda at 0.06 mg per liter) amino-terminal fragments of the mlp protein fused to the his(6) and cftr peptides or his(6) peptide, respectively. therefore, these newly described proteins from l. fermentum br11 have potential as protein production and targeting vectors.

TI  == vaginal bacterial flora activates rat peritoneal mast cells.
AB  == sixteen strains of physiological and pathological vaginal bacteria were tested for their ability to secrete histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells in vitro. we noticed that mycoplasma hominis-induced histamine release was very high (up to 53.6%). the stimulation of rat mast cells with staphylococccus cohnii, staphylococcus coagulase(-) (two strains), ureaplasma urealyticum, peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides capillosus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae resulted in lower but significant histamine secretion (11.2%-17.5%). other bacteria strains (staphylococcus epidermidids, enterococcus  faecalis, escherichia coli, actinomyces naeslundii (two strains) and lactobacillus fermentum (two strains) caused very low (4.2% - 8.8%) histamine release.

TI  == adherence of trichomonas vaginalis to cell culture monolayers.
AB  == the in vitro adherence to wish cells of a pathogenic trichomonas vaginalis strain was studied with a method utilizing thymidine-labeled protozoa. a marked dose-related adherence was observed. glutaraldehyde fixed trichomonads were not adherent. the presence of fetal calf serum during the assay did not influence attachment. concanavalin a inhibited adherence of protozoa. complete or partial inhibition of adherence was achieved by preincubating wish cells with lactobacillus fermentum or streptococcus agalactiae. finally, pretreatment of cells with alpha-estradiol, beta-estradiol, progesterone and estrone influenced attachment of protozoa, whereas estriol was ineffective. these results suggest that adherence of trichomonas vaginalis is dependent on different factors, whose  manipulation may have clinical relevance in preventing recurrence of trichomonad  vaginitis.
