TI  == the microbial epidemiology of breast implant infections in a regional referral centre for plastic and reconstructive surgery in the south of france.
AB  == background: breast implant infections are usually caused by staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. gram-negative bacilli are rarely reported to be involved in breast implant infections. methods: thirty-seven cases of microbiologically confirmed breast implant infection managed from january 2008 to june 2012 in the study centre were reviewed, including 10 cases from the study centre itself and 27 cases from private clinics in the region. results: the prevalence of breast implant infection in the study centre was 0.74% of breast implantation, i.e., 3.23% in breast reconstruction for breast cancer and 0.27% in aesthetic breast augmentation (p=0.0002). of the 37 cases, 30% had undergone radiotherapy and 11% had undergone a lymph node dissection. s. aureus was identified in 18 cases, gram-negative bacilli in 10 cases, coagulase-negative staphylococci in eight cases, anaerobic bacteria in eight cases, and streptococci in three cases. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the second most commonly identified pathogen. staphylococcus epidermidis was the most frequent coagulase-negative staphylococcus species. in addition to propionibacterium acnes and actinomyces neuii, other facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria have not been reported before, e.g., bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, corynebacterium simulans, dermabacter hominis, finegoldia magna, and peptoniphilus harei. seventy-percent of cases were treated by immediate implant removal. all cases treated only with antibiotics were treated with surgery at the second visit. conclusions: the microbiological epidemiology was noted by an increasing the proportion of gram-negative bacteria  and anaerobic bacteria detected with the advent of maldi-tof ms and molecular identification for diagnosis.

TI  == synergistic effect of 2% chlorhexidine combined with proteolytic enzymes on biofilm disruption and killing.
AB  == aim: to investigate the dynamics of a disinfection regimen using 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase k in combination with 2% chlorhexidine (with or without ultrasonics) using a nutrient-stressed endodontic multispecies model biofilm. methodology: nutrient-stressed biofilms (propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus  epidermidis, actinomyces radicidentis, streptococcus mitis and enterococcus faecalis omgs 3202) were grown in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth. the treatment groups included 1% trypsin and 2% chlorhexidine (chx), 1% proteinase k and 2% chx (with and without ultrasonics). 2% chx was the positive control and untreated group, and sterile saline (with and without ultrasonics) was the negative control. the biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. results: the trypsin and chx group with ultrasonics was significantly more effective in reducing viable counts and the substratum coverage than those of all other groups (p < 0.05). the viable counts of the proteinase k and chx group used with (4.26 +/- 0.58 log10 cfu ml-1 ) or without ultrasonics (5.05 +/-  1.36 log10 cfu ml-1 ) were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) as compared with the  untreated control (7.67 +/- 0.84 log10 cfu ml-1 ) and saline groups used with (6.57 +/- 0.73 log10 cfu ml-1 ) and without ultrasonics (6.74 +/- 0.10 log10 cfu  ml-1 ). the chx group was less effective in biofilm disruption compared to when used in combination with trypsin and proteinase k. conclusion: the trypsin and chx group with ultrasonics was significantly more effective at reducing bacterial viable counts and disrupting biofilm.

TI  == a commentary on the disparate perspectives of clinical microbiologists and surgeons: ad hoc antimicrobial use.
AB  == prosthetic joints and other orthopedic implants have improved quality of life for patients world-wide and the use of such devices is increasing. however, while infection rates subsequent to associated surgery are relatively low (<3%), the consequences of incidence are considerable, encompassing morbidity (including amputation) and mortality in addition to significant social and economic costs. emphasis, therefore, has been placed on mitigating microbial risk, with clinical  microbiologists and surgeons utilizing rapidly evolving molecular laboratory techniques in detection and diagnosis of infection, which still occurs despite sophisticated patient management. multidisciplinary approaches are regularly adopted to achieve this. in this commentary, we describe an unusual case of actinomyces infection in total hip arthroplasty and, in that context, describe the perspectives of the clinical microbiology and surgical teams and how they contrasted. more specifically, this case demonstrates an ad hoc approach to structured eradication of biofilms and intracellular bacteria related to biomaterials, as reflected in early usage of linezolid. this is a complex topic and, as described in this case, such accelerated treatment can be effective. this commentary focuses on the merits of such inadvisable use of potent antimicrobials amid the risk of diminishing valuable antimicrobial efficacy, albeit resulting in desirable patient outcomes.

TI  == the effectiveness of enzymic irrigation in removing a nutrient-stressed endodontic multispecies biofilm.
AB  == aim: to establish a nutrient-stressed multispecies model biofilm and investigate  the dynamics of biofilm killing and disruption by 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase k  with or without ultrasonic activation. methodology: nutrient-stressed biofilms (propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis, actinomyces radicidentis, streptococcus mitis and enterococcus faecalis omgs 3202) were grown on hydroxyapatite discs and in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth in modified fluid universal medium. the treatment groups included trypsin, proteinase k, 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate and 1% sodium hypochlorite (naocl) (with and without ultrasonics). naocl and chlorhexidine were the positive controls and untreated group, and sterile saline was the negative control. the biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. results: nutrient stress in the multispecies biofilm was apparent as the medium ph became alkaline, glucose was absent, and serum proteins were degraded in the supernatant. the clsm showed the percentage reduction in viable bacteria at the biofilm surface level due to nutrient starvation. on the disc model, trypsin and proteinase k were effective in killing bacteria; their aerobic viable counts were significantly lower (p < 0.01) than the negative control and chlorhexidine. naocl was the most  effective agent (p < 0.001). in the tooth model, when compared to saline, trypsin with ultrasonics caused significant killing both aerobically and anaerobically (p < 0.05). chlorhexidine (1.46 +/- 0.42), trypsin (3.56 +/- 1.18) and proteinase k  (4.2 +/- 1.01) with ultrasonics were significantly effective (p < 0.05) in reducing the substratum coverage as compared to saline with ultrasonics (12% +/-  4.9). conclusion: trypsin with ultrasonic activation has a biofilm killing and disrupting potential.

TI  == antibacterial and antifungal activities of punica granatum peel extracts against  oral pathogens.
AB  == objective: punica granatum has been used for many years in folk medicine due to several purposes. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of methanolic extract of punica granatum peel (mepgp) against streptococcus mutans,  staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguinis, staphylococcus epidermidis, actynomyces viscosus, lactobacillus acidophilus and candida albicans. materials and methods: in this in vitro study, the mentioned oral organisms were cultured in blood agar and mueller-hinton media and then paper disks containing mepgp at concentrations of 4 mg/ml, 8 mg/ml and 12 mg/ml were inserted on medias. the antimicrobial activity was evaluated by agar disk diffusion method. the effects of three different concentrations of mepgp against  microorganisms were compared using one-way anova and tukey tests. results: all concentrations of mepgp had antibacterial activity against s. aureus and s. epidermidis. only at concentration of 8 mg/ml and 12 mg/ml mepgp was effective against l. acidophilus, s. mutans and s. salivarius. furthermore; no concentrations of mepgp inhibited a. viscosus and c. albicans. conclusion: this study suggests that mepgp might be used as an antibacterial agent in controlling  oral infections.

TI  == prevalence, intensity and identity of bacteraemia following conservative dental procedures in children.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence, intensity  and microbial identity of bacteraemia following conservative dental procedures. the procedures were placement of rubber dam, use of the fast drill, use of the slow drill and placement of a matrix band and wedge. method: two hundred and five children and adolescents undergoing general anaesthesia for dental treatment at the eastman dental hospital were recruited. each subject was randomly allocated to one of the procedure groups. a baseline blood sample was taken before any dental treatment was carried out. a second blood sample was taken 30 s after a single conservative procedure. the blood samples were processed using lysis filtration. all bacterial isolates were identified using comparative 16 s ribosomal rna gene sequencing. oral streptococcus spp. and coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. were further identified by comparative soda gene sequencing.  results: the prevalence of bacteraemia was significantly greater following placement of rubber dam (p = 0.01) and placement of matrix band and wedge, compared with baseline. the intensity of bacteraemia was significantly greater following placement of rubber dam (p = 0.001) and placement of matrix band and wedge (p = 0.0001). the most frequently isolated bacteria were streptococcus spp. (56%), actinomyces spp. (15%) and coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. (15%). conclusion: conservative dental procedures are a significant cause of bacteraemia.

TI  == the prevalence of multidose vial contamination by aerobic bacteria in a major teaching hospital, shiraz, iran, 2006.
AB  == background: parenteral medications are usually given out in multidose vials (mdvs) and can be used for a prolonged period for 1 or more patients. the risk of extrinsic contamination of mdvs and its consequences may be serious and may lead  to an outbreak, especially in hospitals. therefore, bacterial contamination of multiple-dose medication vials in namazi hospital, the major referral teaching hospital, in shiraz, southwestern iran, was evaluated. methods: in a period of 4  months, all used mdvs in namazi hospital were collected by the infection control  nurses. information was recorded about the medication, labeling of vials, storing temperature, wards, and dates of opening. remained contents of each vial were also tested for aerobic bacteria. microbial contamination was confirmed by microbiologic methods. results: bacterial contamination was identified in 36 of 637 (5.6%) of vials, with no difference in contamination among different wards in the hospital or the medication type. most commonly identified organisms were part of the normal commensally flora. gram-positive bacteria (88.9%) were more significantly involved than gram-negative ones (11.1%), with the highest frequency for staphylococcus epidermidis (44.4%) and the lowest for actinomyces viscosus (2.8%). conclusion: although the clinical significance is not resolved at this point, infection control practices should be emphasized considering this  potential source of nosocomial infection.

TI  == mechanisms of inhibition by fluoride of urease activities of cell suspensions and biofilms of staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii and of dental plaque.
AB  == background/aims: fluoride is known to be a potent inhibitor of bacterial ureases  and can also act in the form of hydrofluoric acid as a transmembrane proton conductor to acidify the cytoplasm of intact cells with possible indirect, acid inhibition of urease. our research objectives were to assess the inhibitory potencies of fluoride for three urease-positive bacteria commonly found in the mouth and to determine the relative importance of direct and indirect inhibition  of ureases for overall inhibition of intact cells or biofilms. methods: the experimental design involved intact bacteria in suspensions, mono-organism biofilms, cell extracts, and dental plaque. standard enzymatic assays for ammonia production from urea were used. results: we found that ureolysis by cells in suspensions or mono-organism biofilms of staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus salivarius or actinomyces naeslundii was inhibited by fluoride at plaque levels of 0.1-0.5 mm in a ph-dependent manner. the results of experiments  with the organic weak acids indomethacin and capric acid, which do not directly inhibit urease enzyme, indicated that weak-acid effects leading to cytoplasmic acidification are also involved in fluoride inhibition. however, direct fluoride  inhibition of urease appeared to be the major mechanism for reduction in ureolytic activity in acid environments. results of experiments with freshly harvested supragingival dental plaque indicated responses to fluoride similar to  those of s. salivarius with ph-dependent fluoride inhibition and both direct and  indirect inhibition of urease. conclusion: fluoride can act to diminish alkali production from urea by oral bacteria through direct and indirect mechanisms.

TI  == evaluation of bacterial nitrate reduction in the human oral cavity.
AB  == it is hypothesized that the enterosalivary nitrate circulation encourages nitrate reducing bacteria to reside within the oral cavity. nitrite production may then limit the growth of acidogenic bacteria as a result of the production of antimicrobial oxides of nitrogen, including nitric oxide. this study was carried  out with 10 subjects to characterize oral nitrate reduction and identify the bacteria responsible. nitrate reduction varied between individuals (mean 85.4 +/- 15.9 nmol nitrite min(-1) with 10 ml 1 mm kno(3) mouth wash) and was found to be  concentrated at the rear of the tongue dorsal surface. nitrate reductase positive isolates identified, using 16s rdna sequencing, from the tongue comprised veillonella atypica (34%), veillonella dispar (24%), actinomyces odontolyticus (21%), actinomyces naeslundii (2%), rothia mucilaginosa (10%), rothia dentocariosa (3%) and staphylococcus epidermidis (5%). nitrite production rates,  using intact and permeabilized cells, of the major tongue nitrate reducers were determined in the presence of methyl and benzyl viologen. under anaerobic conditions in the presence of nitrate, rates in decreasing order were: a. odontolyticus > r. mucilaginosa > r. dentocariosa > v. dispar > v. atypica. in conclusion, veillonella spp. were found to be the most prevalent taxa isolated and thus may make a major contribution to nitrate reduction in the oral cavity.

TI  == microbial analysis of bone collected during implant surgery: a clinical and laboratory study.
AB  == dental implant surgery produces bone debris which can be used to correct bone defects in the "simultaneous-augmentation" technique. however, this debris is potentially contaminated with oral bacteria. therefore, this study examined bone  debris collected during dental implant surgery in order 1) to identify the microbial contaminants and 2) to compare the effects of two different aspiration  protocols on the levels of microbial contamination. twenty-four partially dentate patients were randomly allocated into two equal groups and underwent bone collection using the frios bone collector during surgery to insert two endosseous dental implants. in group s (using a stringent aspiration protocol), bone collection occurred within the surgical site only. in group ns (utilizing a non-stringent aspiration protocol), bone collection and tissue fluid control was  achieved using the same suction tip. bone samples were immediately transported for microbial analysis. colonial and microscopic morphology, gaseous requirements and identification kits were utilized for identification of the isolated microbes. twenty-eight species were identified including a number associated with disease, in particular, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus epidermidis as well as the anaerobes actinomyces odontolyticus, eubacterium sp., prevotella intermedia, propionibacterium propionicum and peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. in group s (stringent aspiration protocol), significantly fewer organisms were found than in group ns, the non-stringent aspiration protocol (p=0.001). gram-positive cocci dominated the isolates from both groups. it is concluded that if bone debris is collected for implantation around dental implants, it should be collected with a stringent aspiration protocol (within the surgical site only) to minimize bacterial contaminants.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 gram-positive microorganisms. the mic(90) (mg/l) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus anginosus and actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for streptococcus sanguis and listeria monocytogenes, 2 for corynebacterium jekeium and bifidobacterium bivius. over 50% of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium,  quinolone-resistant staphylococci, nocardia steroides and clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/l moxifloxacin. moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against gram-positive bacilli.

TI  == beta-hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms in apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis.
AB  == thirteen teeth with necrotic pulps and apical periodontitis and nine severe periodontal pockets were cultured for presence of beta-hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms. samples were dispersed and plated on two non-selective and one selective growth media and incubated anaerobically and in 10% co2 in air. a total of 59 beta-hemolytic colonies were purified and identified. eight beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates were obtained from three  of the severe marginal periodontitis sites. all were identified as belonging to the streptococcus sanguis group. no beta-hemolytic streptococci were detected in  apical periodontitis samples. twenty obligately anaerobic isolates were detected, all of which were known periodontal and endodontic pathogens. isolates from apical periodontitis sites were identified as propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces naeslundii, actionomyces odontolyticus and peptostreptococcus micros, while severe marginal periodontal sites contained the same species with the addition of actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces meyeri. of 19 staphylococci and  micrococci, staphylococcus epidermidis was the predominant isolate in both apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis sites. however, less commonly known organisms such as staphylococcus cohnii and micrococcus sp. were identified in severe marginal periodontitis sites. the isolation of bacillus sp. (12 isolates) in one severe marginal periodontitis and two apical periodontitis subjects was especially interesting, warranting consideration of this organism as a legitimate isolate and potential pathogen in oral disease.

TI  == isolation and characterization of an antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain ponssii.
AB  == an antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain ponssii has been isolated and partially characterized. the antibiotic is produced throughout culture growth, with maximum amounts accumulating in the broth when the culture is in the early stationary phase of growth. the activity declines within about 30 h after the culture enters stationary phase. purification techniques included chromatography on amberlite xad-2, deae sephadex and sp sephadex in addition to c18 hplc with an average yield of 75%. this antibiotic only inhibits pathogenic strains of s. scabies that cause scab disease on potato and other tuberous vegetables and does not affect s. griseus, s. venezuelae, actinomyces bovis, nocardia asteroides, clostridium perfringens, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus, serratia marcescens and escherichia coli. the antibiotic has a molecular weight of 500 or less, and is stable for weeks at acidic ph but is very labile at alkaline ph conditions.

TI  == enzymatic removal and disinfection of bacterial biofilms.
AB  == model biofilms of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas  fluorescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were made on steel and polypropylene substrata. plaque-resembling biofilms of streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, and fusobacterium nucleatum were made on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite.  the activity of enzymes against bacterial cells in biofilm was measured by fluorescence microscopy and an indirect conductance test in which evolution of carbon dioxide was measured. glucose oxidase combined with lactoperoxidase was bactericidal against biofilm bacteria but did not remove the biofilm from the substrata. a complex mixture of polysaccharide-hydrolyzing enzymes was able to remove bacterial biofilm from steel and polypropylene substrata but did not have  a significant bactericidal activity. combining oxidoreductases with polysaccharide-hydrolyzing enzymes resulted in bactericidal activity as well as removal of the biofilm.

TI  == bacterial identity and characteristics in healthy and unhealthy respiratory tracts of sheep and calves.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare different bacteriological aspects of the respiratory systems of healthy (h) versus unhealthy (uh) animals with respiratory signs. the prevalence of different bacterial species was determined in the upper  and lower respiratory tract of h and uh najdi sheep, somali sheep and holstein calves. the characteristics of pasteurella spp. isolates, and the biotype of pasteurella haemolytica were identified in h and uh animals, eighteen out of 28 (64.3%) of the identified bacterial species in the upper respiratory tract were more prevalent in the nasal cavities of uh najdi and somali sheep and holstein calves with respiratory signs than in apparently healthy animals; four of the most prevalent bacteria in the upper respiratory system of uh sheep were moraxella spp., pseudomonas pseudomallei, erysipelothrix spp., pasteurella multocida, while three of the most prevalent bacteria in uh calves were pasteurella haemolytica, actinomyces spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the prevalence of six different bacterial species was greater in the lungs of uh animals, namely actinomyces pyogenes, erysipelothrix spp., p. haemolytica, pasteurella ureae, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis, which could be risk factors in the complexity of the prevalent respiratory diseases of  the animals surveyed. of the biochemical, cytological and colonial characteristics studied in the identified p. haemolytica and p. multocida, two characters were significantly different (p < 0.05) in organisms isolated from uh  as compared to those from h animals. these were the higher loss of haemolytic power by the strains of p. haemolytica and the decreased fermentation of trehalose by all the strains of p. multocida recovered from healthy animals. the  only biotype of p. haemolytica isolated from h animals was biotype a, while both  biotypes a (88.0% of the isolates) and t (12.0% of the isolates) were recovered from uh animals.

TI  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans on denture surfaces.
AB  == infectious diseases caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, mrsa,  and candida albicans are often serious in compromised hosts. we enumerated mrsa and c. albicans on denture surfaces and in saliva samples from 29 adults. staphylococcus species, mrsa, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, mrse, were detected on 17, 3, and 1 of the 29 denture surfaces, respectively. c. albicans were detected on 22 denture surfaces. all saliva samples from patients whose dentures carried staphylococcus species and c. albicans were also found to contain both microorganisms. adherence of isolated 3h labeled cells of mrsa and c. albicans to resin beads and saliva-coated resin beads was examined. cells of both microorganisms adhered in significantly higher  numbers to saliva-coated resin beads than to resin beads. the hydrophobicity of the mrsa isolated from denture surfaces varied from strain to strain; that of c.  albicans strains was moderately high. the zeta potentials of mrsa isolates and of c. albicans isolates determined in kci buffer were significantly low. the potential of the resin beads decreased after treatment with saliva. two out of 5  mrsa strains were found to be inhibited in growth by oral streptococcus, actinomyces, and gram-negative bacterial strains, suggesting that some oral bacterial species play a role in inhibiting the colonization of staphylococcus species. no isolates of c. albicans were inhibited in their growth by any of the  oral bacteria tested. isolates of mrsa and c. albicans coaggregated with porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum strains. using denture cleaners every night for 2 weeks did not reduce numbers of staphylococcus species or c. albicans organisms in saliva.

TI  == bacteria in human mouths involved in the production and utilization of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == earlier studies have demonstrated that pure cultures of oral streptococci produce hydrogen peroxide but none has found any free peroxide in dental plaque or salivary sediment despite streptococci being major components of their mixed bacterial populations. the absence of peroxide in plaque and sediment could be due to the dominance of its destruction over its formation by bacterial constituents. to identify which of the oral bacteria might be involved in such a  possibility, pure cultures of 27 different oral bacteria were surveyed (as well as dental plaque and sediment) for their peroxide-forming and peroxide-removing capabilities. peroxide production was measured for each of the pure cultures by incubation with glucose at low and high substrate concentrations (2.8 and 28.0 mm) for 4 h and with the ph kept at 7.0 by a ph-stat. removal of hydrogen peroxide was assessed in similar experiments where peroxide at 0, 29.4, 147.2 or  294.4 mm [0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1% (w/v)] replaced the glucose. hydrogen peroxide formation was seen with only three of the bacteria tested, streptococcus sanguis  i and ii (sanguis and oralis), and strep. mitior (mitis biotype i); levels of hydrogen peroxide between 2.2 and 9.8 mm were produced when these micro-organisms were grown aerobically and 1.1 and 3.9 mm when grown anaerobically. earlier reports indicate that such levels were usually sufficient to inhibit the growth of many plaque bacteria. the amounts formed were similar at the two glucose levels tested, suggesting that maximum peroxide production is reached at low glucose concentration. none of the three peroxide-producing organisms was able to utilize hydrogen peroxide but five of the other 24 tested, neisseria sicca, haemophilus segnis, h. parainfluenzae, actinomyces viscosus and staphylococcus epidermidis, could readily do so, as could the mixed bacteria in salivary sediment and dental plaque, both of which contain relatively high numbers of these peroxide-utilizing micro-organisms. the ability of the bacteria in plaque and sediment to degrade hydrogen peroxide was considerable and extremely rapid; peroxide removal and usually complete within the first 15 min of the incubation even when its initial level was as high as 294.4 mm. this almost overwhelming ability to remove peroxide was confirmed when peroxide-producing and -using cultures were mixed and when each of eight salivary sediments was incubated with  glucose and with peroxide at concentrations up to 294.4 mm. in the glucose incubations, no hydrogen peroxide was observed, indicating dominance of microbial peroxide removers over hydrogen peroxide producers.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == comparison of the effects of galactose and glucose on the ph responses of human dental plaque, salivary sediment and pure cultures of oral bacteria.
AB  == comparisons made in dental plaque in vivo demonstrated that galactose produces a  significantly smaller decrease in ph than does glucose. in vitro studies with plaque, salivary sediment and pure cultures of oral bacteria done in the absence  of intraoral factors such as flowing saliva confirmed this lesser acidogenicity of galactose. pure culture showed that most of the bacteria tested produce a moderate to large decrease with glucose but only a few do so with galactose; most produced a moderate to little or no ph response with this sugar. this suggested that the smaller decreases in ph seen in plaque in vivo with galactose were largely due to bacterial differences, basically that resident micro-organisms individually have less galactolytic than glucolytic capability. variance in capability was attributed to differences in membrane transport processes and metabolic pathways normally available to bacteria for galactose and glucose catabolism. in the in vitro experiments, because plaque and sediment can produce  base as readily as they can produce acid, the nitrogenous substrates identified earlier as major stimulants of base formation, urea and arginine, were concurrently examined for their attenuating effects on the galactose and glucose  ph responses. these showed, consistent with its lesser acidogenicity, that galactose could be countered more readily in its ability to reduce the ph by either of these two base-forming substrates than could glucose. the effects were  different with urea and with arginine, urea attenuation occurred sooner and arginine attenuation later in both plaque and sediment. the corresponding acid-base ph profiles for pure cultures were different.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == use of monoclonal antibodies with neutralizing effects on toxic antigens from human bacterial plaque to detect specific bacteria by colony blotting.
AB  == inflammatory periodontal diseases are provoked by bacteria which adhere to teeth  at the gingival margin and form plaques containing toxins detectable by their effect on mammalian cells in culture. the aim of this study was to make toxin-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and determine whether they detect antigen in specific oral bacteria. bacterial plaque was collected from teeth and  homogenized, and the fluid phase (plaque extract) was boiled or first fractionated over sephacryl s-300. hybridomas from immunized mice secreted immunoglobulin m (igm) antibodies which reacted to plaque antigens. neutralization was detected by an increase in the growth of hl60 cells which were exposed to plaque toxins in the presence of igm from hybridoma culture or ascitic fluids. however, the neutralization was obvious only when the plaque toxins reduced growth by 50% or less. plaque toxin preparations were found to contain proteases which hydrolyzed all of the igm in ascitic fluids within 24 h. replenishing the igm daily preserved protection compared with protection from igm from other hybridomas or saline only. the decrease in the specific activity of plaque proteins caused by replenishing one such antibody (3he5) was 2.5-fold compared with activity with unreplenished 3he5, 3.8-fold compared with activity with saline only, and 10.7-fold compared with activity with replenished, unrelated antibody. the neutralizing igm detected an array of 14,000- to 22,000-molecular-weight antigens. the native toxins may be aggregates of these antigens, or the array may indicate fragments of an undetected, larger antigen or a common, nonpeptide adduct. only 0.5 to 0.8% of the bacteria from sites with periodontitis and grown on blood agar contained antigen. one group of reactive bacteria was identified as actinomyces odontolyticus serotype i. other isolates were identified as staphylococcus epidermidis, but antigen disappeared from the these isolates within 6 weeks of subculture. epitope-containing antigens were also found in streptococcal and eikenella isolates, and it is likely that the antigens from only some of these bacteria are toxic.

TI  == studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  == two unique forms of periodontal disease, hiv-gingivitis and hiv-periodontitis, have been described in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). in order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in aids patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 aids patients with periodontitis. the presence of putative periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly b. gingivalis), and wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 aids patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. of 666 bacterial  strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, streptococcus sanguis ii was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), porphyromonas gingivalis  (12%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. enteric species including enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis, clostridium clostridiiforme and clostridium difficle as well as klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. intermedius, and  p. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four  times more periodontitis patients demonstrated w. recta. subgingival yeast was a  frequent finding in these aids patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. this study indicates that subgingival plaque in aids patients with  periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-hiv infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.

AB  == the aim of this study was to determine an influence of udder infection on milk chloride level and on milk productivity of cows of black and white race. bacteriological analysis was performed by bacterial isolation from milk collected in sterile conditions from single lobes of mammary gland. the study was aimed to  detect the following bacteria: streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, actinomyces pyogenes, enterobacteriaceae rods, corynebacterium bovis, and micrococcus sp. milk chloride level was determined by burette method in 1250 milk samples collected from entire udder. milk productivity was determined on the day  of bacterial isolation. statistical analysis of the results of the study on udder infection, milk chloride level, and milk productivity of mammary gland did reveal lack of a simple correlations between those parameters and in the indirect manner indicated an influence of inappropriate maintenance conditions of tested cows on  the health condition of their udder. it seems possible that alkalosis and acidosis in cows, taken into consideration in discussion section, could constitute a factor influencing the frequency of mastitis incidence.

TI  == arginolytic and ureolytic activities of pure cultures of human oral bacteria and  their effects on the ph response of salivary sediment and dental plaque in vitro.
AB  == thirty-nine different microorganisms commonly found in supragingival plaque and salivary sediment were screened for their ability to raise the ph by producing base from arginine, lysylarginine and urea. only actinomyces naeslundii and staphylococcus epidermidis showed significant ph-rise activity with all three compounds. eleven bacteria demonstrated such activity with arginine and lysylarginine but not with urea. only one, actinomyces viscosus, produced a ph-rise with urea but not with the two arginine compounds. the remaining 26 bacteria showed little or no base-forming activity with any of the three test substrates. the ability of the different oral bacteria to produce base (especially from urea) was a less universal function than their ability to produce acid from fermentable carbohydrate. substituting pure cultures of arginolytic or non-arginolytic bacteria for portions of the mixed bacterial populations of plaque or sediment in test incubations containing glucose and arginine altered their ability to produce ph-fall-ph-rise responses shaped like those of the stephen curve in vivo. in general, addition of arginolytic bacteria  made these in vitro ph responses less acidic, whereas addition of non-arginolytic bacteria made the responses more acidic. because of the relatively high arginolytic activity of the plaque harvested in this study, the effect of adding  non-arginolytic bacteria was more readily seen than the converse. similar changes in levels of ureolytic microorganisms and incubation with glucose and urea had little effect on sediment or plaque being able to produce a ph-fall-ph-rise type  of response. when increasing proportions of the mixed bacteria in salivary sediment were replaced with the highly cariogenic lactobacillus casei or streptococcus mutans, the ph minimum became slightly more acidic and then slightly more alkaline, whereas the ph-rise became progressively and significantly less. thus arginolytic bacteria have a different and greater effect on shaping the ph response of plaque or sediment than ureolytic bacteria. a large change in the proportions of arginolytic or non-arginolytic microorganisms may be needed to make a plaque microflora potentially non-cariogenic or cariogenic, respectively.

TI  == keratinolytic activity of cutaneous and oral bacteria.
AB  == a test was developed to measure the keratinolytic activity of cutaneous and oral  bacteria. keratin, labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate, was used in a phosphate buffer (ph 7.2) with 1 mm dithiothreitol. the degradation of keratin was estimated by measuring the fluorescence of the degradation products in the supernatant of the reaction mixtures in a luminescence spectrometer. several oral and cutaneous bacteria were investigated: bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, treponema denticola, actinomyces odontolyticus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus hominis, staphylococcus  saprophyticus, brevibacterium epidermidis, brevibacterium lines, corynebacterium  glutamicum, corynebacterium minutissimum, corynebacterium ovis, and rhodococcus equi. the dermatophyte trichophyton rubrum was used as a control organism. the test offered a simple and quantitative method for the estimation of keratin degradation and enabled us to show keratinolytic activity in trichophyton rubrum, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, b. linens, b. epidermidis, bacteroides gingivalis, and treponema denticola. the keratinolytic activity was cell bound and heat sensitive. the presence of dithiothreitol stimulated the degradation of  keratin to mainly high-molecular-weight products.

TI  == ability of oral bacteria to degrade fibronectin.
AB  == the fibronectin-degrading ability of 116, mainly oral, strains was assayed by using plasma-derived fibronectin adsorbed to a polystyrene surface. ability to degrade fibronectin was revealed in strains of bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides loeschii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, peptococcus prevotii, clostridium sporogenes, and propionibacterium acnes. the fibronectinolytic activity of subgingival bacteriological samples was found to be related to the presence of b. gingivalis  and b. intermedius. in addition, strains of the nonoral bacteroides species b. asaccharolyticus and b. fragilis showed fibronectin-degrading ability. no such ability was detected in the oral strains tested of streptococcus, veillonella, actinomyces, lactobacillus, actinobacillus, capnocytophaga, fusobacterium, or haemophilus species.

TI  == mode of action and in-vitro activity of vancomycin.
AB  == vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. it also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. there is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits  ribonucleic acid synthesis. induction of bacterial l-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. stable l-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to  vancomycin. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant  strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), str. pyogenes, str. agalactiae, str. bovis, str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species and lactobacillus species. there has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against staph. aureus, str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. the combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of staph. epidermidis. it shows indifference against enterococci. vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against staph. aureus.

TI  == characterization of a monoclonal antibody specific for lipoteichoic acid from various gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == a hybrid cell line, 3g6, producing monoclonal antibody (mab) against the polyglycerophosphate (pgp) backbone of lipoteichoic acids has been derived by the polyethylene glycol-induced fusion of mouse myeloma cells and spleen cells from mice immunized with partially purified glucosyltransferase from culture supernatant of streptococcus mutans strain 6715. immunodiffusion tests and elisa  revealed that the antibody reacted with purified pgp from group a streptococcus pyogenes strain sv as well as crude phenol-water and saline extracts of various gram-positive bacteria except for a few species such as biotype b s. sanguis, micrococcus sp., and actinomyces viscosus. whole cells of serotype b s. mutans and staphylococcus epidermidis were agglutinated upon addition of 3g6 mab, while  those of most other species were not significantly affected by this procedure. a  hapten inhibition study showed that glycerophosphate was only a potent inhibitor  of passive hemagglutination reactions between lta coated sheep erythrocytes and 3g6 mab.

TI  == production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
AB  == staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. these strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of staphylococcus aureus fda209p. the frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. strain iys2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. iys2 was identified to be s. aureus, based on its biological properties. the bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. the isoelectric point was 10.0. in amino acid  composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. the bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. the bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. an analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that streptococcus salivarius, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium parvulum, and actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacterionema matruchotii, and bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. the majority of s. aureus tested were susceptible, and all staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.

TI  == the antibacterial action of vancomycin.
AB  == vancomycin inhibits the second stage of cell wall synthesis in susceptible bacteria. furthermore, there is evidence that vancomycin also alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits ribonucleic acid synthesis. stable l-phase variants are susceptible to vancomycin, but induction of bacterial l-phase variants with vancomycin is very difficult. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive cocci and bacilli, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (including multiply resistant strains). streptococcus  pneumoniae (including multiply resistant strains), streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus bovis, viridans group streptococcus, enterococcus, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species, and lactobacillus species. antimicrobial activity can be enhanced with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against s. aureus, s. bovis, enterococcus, and viridans streptococcus. the combination of vancomycin and rifampin also has enhanced activity against s. aureus.

TI  == immunoadjuvant activities of cell walls and their water-soluble fractions prepared from various gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the cell walls from all 21 species of gram-positive bacteria examined, except lysozyme-susceptible micrococcus lysodeikticus (nctc 2665) and lysozyme-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (atcc 155), were found to be definitely adjuvant-active in both stimulation of increased serum antibody levels and induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity to ovalbumin when administered to guinea-pigs as water-in-oil emulsions. using various cell wall lytic enzymes, the immunoadjuvant principles were solubilized with full retention of the adjuvant activities from walls of staphylococcus aureus (copenhagen), streptococcus pyogens (group a, type 6; s43/100), streptococcus salivarius (ifo 3350), streptococcus faecalis (ifo 12580), streptococcus mutans (bht), lactobacillus plantarum (atcc 8014), bacillus megaterium (ifo 12068), corynebacterium diphtheriae (park-williams no. 8), mycobacterium smegmatis, and actinomyces viscous (atcc 15987). evidence was obtained that the non-peptidoglycan portion of the cell walls is not essential for manifestation of immunoadjuvancy.
