TI  == microbiota and diabetes: an evolving relationship.
AB  == the gut microbiota affects numerous biological functions throughout the body and  its characterisation has become a major research area in biomedicine. recent studies have suggested that gut bacteria play a fundamental role in diseases such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. data are accumulating in animal  models and humans suggesting that obesity and type 2 diabetes (t2d) are associated with a profound dysbiosis. first human metagenome-wide association studies demonstrated highly significant correlations of specific intestinal bacteria, certain bacterial genes and respective metabolic pathways with t2d. importantly, especially butyrate-producing bacteria such as roseburia intestinalis and faecalibacterium prausnitzii concentrations were lower in t2d subjects. this supports the increasing evidence, that butyrate and other short-chain fatty acids are able to exert profound immunometabolic effects. endotoxaemia, most likely gut-derived has also been observed in patients with metabolic syndrome and t2d and might play a key role in metabolic inflammation. a further hint towards an association between microbiota and t2d has been derived from studies in pregnancy showing that major gut microbial shifts occurring during pregnancy affect host metabolism. interestingly, certain antidiabetic drugs such as metformin also interfere with the intestinal microbiota. specific members of the microbiota such as akkermansia muciniphila might be decreased in diabetes and when administered to murines exerted antidiabetic effects. therefore, as a 'gut signature' becomes more evident in t2d, a better understanding of the role of the microbiota in diabetes might provide new aspects regarding its pathophysiological relevance and pave the way for new therapeutic principles.

TI  == fluctuations in butyrate-producing bacteria in ulcerative colitis patients of north india.
AB  == aim: to study the interplay between butyrate concentration and butyrate-producing bacteria in fecal samples of ulcerative colitis (uc) patients vs control individuals. methods: fecal samples were collected from 14 control individuals (hemorrhoid patients only) and 26 uc patients (severe: n = 12, moderate: n = 6, remission: n = 8), recruited by the gastroenterologist at the department of gastroenterology, all india institute of medical sciences, new delhi, india. disease activity in uc patients was determined by clinical colitis activity index. we employed fluorescent in situ hybridization in combination with flow cytometry to enumerate the clostridium cluster population targeted by 16s rrna gene probe. major butyrate-producing species within this cluster were quantified  to see if any change existed in control vs uc patients with different disease activity. this observed change was further validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. in addition to this, we carried out gas chromatography to evaluate the changes in concentration of major short chain fatty acids (scfas), namely acetate, n-butyrate, iso-butyrate, in the above samples. student t test and graph pad prism-6 were used to compare the data statistically. results: there was a significant decrease of clostridium coccoides (control, 25.69% +/- 1.62% vs severe, 9.8% +/- 2.4%, p = 0.0001) and clostridium leptum clusters (control, 13.74% +/- 1.05% vs severe, 6.2% +/- 1.8%, p = 0.0001) in fecal samples of uc patients. furthermore, we demonstrated that some butyrate-producing members of the clostridial cluster, like fecalibacterium prausnitzii (control, 11.66% +/- 1.55% vs severe, 6.01% +/- 1.6%, p = 0.0001) and roseburia intestinalis (control, 14.48% +/- 1.52% vs severe, 9% +/- 1.83%, p = 0.02) were differentially present in patients with different disease activity. in addition, we also demonstrated decreased concentrations of fecal scfas, especially of n-butyrate (control, 24.32 +/- 1.86 mmol/mul vs severe, 12.74 +/- 2.75 mmol/mul, p = 0.003), iso-butyrate (control, 1.70 +/- 0.41 mmol/mul vs severe, 0.68 +/- 0.24 mmol/mul, p = 0.0441) and acetate (control, 39.51 +/- 1.76 mmol/mul vs severe, 32.12 +/- 2.95 mmol/mul, p = 0.047), in the fecal samples of uc patients. the observed decrease of predominant butyrate producers of clostridial clusters correlated with the reduced scfa levels in active uc patients. this was further confirmed by the restoration in the population of some butyrate producers with simultaneous increase in the level of scfa in remission samples. conclusion: our observations  indicate that decreases in members of the clostridial cluster resulting in reduced butyrate levels contribute to the etiology of uc.

TI  == butyrate-producing clostridium cluster xiva species specifically colonize mucins  in an in vitro gut model.
AB  == the human gut is colonized by a complex microbiota with multiple benefits. although the surface-attached, mucosal microbiota has a unique composition and potential to influence human health, it remains difficult to study in vivo. therefore, we performed an in-depth microbial characterization (human intestinal  tract chip (hitchip)) of a recently developed dynamic in vitro gut model, which simulates both luminal and mucosal gut microbes (mucosal-simulator of human intestinal microbial ecosystem (m-shime)). inter-individual differences among human subjects were confirmed and microbial patterns unique for each individual were preserved in vitro. furthermore, in correspondence with in vivo studies, bacteroidetes and proteobacteria were enriched in the luminal content while firmicutes rather colonized the mucin layer, with clostridium cluster xiva accounting for almost 60% of the mucin-adhered microbiota. of the many acetate and/or lactate-converting butyrate producers within this cluster, roseburia intestinalis and eubacterium rectale most specifically colonized mucins. these 16s rrna gene-based results were confirmed at a functional level as butyryl-coa:acetate-coa transferase gene sequences belonged to different species  in the luminal as opposed to the mucin-adhered microbiota, with roseburia species governing the mucosal butyrate production. correspondingly, the simulated mucosal environment induced a shift from acetate towards butyrate. as not only inter-individual differences were preserved but also because compared with conventional models, washout of relevant mucin-adhered microbes was avoided, simulating the mucosal gut microbiota represents a breakthrough in modeling and mechanistically studying the human intestinal microbiome in health and disease. finally, as mucosal butyrate producers produce butyrate close to the epithelium,  they may enhance butyrate bioavailability, which could be useful in treating diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  == in vitro kinetics of prebiotic inulin-type fructan fermentation by butyrate-producing colon bacteria: implementation of online gas chromatography for quantitative analysis of carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas production.
AB  == kinetic analyses of bacterial growth, carbohydrate consumption, and metabolite production of five butyrate-producing clostridial cluster xiva colon bacteria grown on acetate plus fructose, oligofructose, inulin, or lactate were performed. a gas chromatography method was set up to assess h2 and co2 production online and to ensure complete coverage of all metabolites produced. method accuracy was confirmed through the calculation of electron and carbon recoveries. fermentations with anaerostipes caccae dsm 14662(t), roseburia faecis dsm 16840(t), roseburia hominis dsm 16839(t), and roseburia intestinalis dsm 14610(t) revealed similar patterns of metabolite production with butyrate, co2, and h2 as  the main metabolites. r. faecis dsm 16840(t) and r. intestinalis dsm 14610(t) were able to degrade oligofructose, displaying a nonpreferential breakdown mechanism. lactate consumption was only observed with a. caccae dsm 14662(t). roseburia inulinivorans dsm 16841(t) was the only strain included in the present  study that was able to grow on fructose, oligofructose, and inulin. the metabolites produced were lactate, butyrate, and co2, without h2 production, indicating an energy metabolism distinct from that of other roseburia species. oligofructose degradation was nonpreferential. in a coculture of r. inulinivorans dsm 16841(t) with the highly competitive strain bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum lmg 11047 on inulin, hardly any production of butyrate and co2 was detected, indicating a lack of competitiveness of the butyrate producer. complete recovery of metabolites during fermentations of clostridial cluster xiva butyrate-producing colon bacteria allowed stoichiometric balancing of the metabolic pathway for butyrate production, including h2 formation.

TI  == cross-feeding between bifidobacterium longum bb536 and acetate-converting, butyrate-producing colon bacteria during growth on oligofructose.
AB  == in vitro coculture fermentations of bifidobacterium longum bb536 and two acetate-converting, butyrate-producing colon bacteria, anaerostipes caccae dsm 14662 and roseburia intestinalis dsm 14610, with oligofructose as the sole energy source, were performed to study interspecies interactions. two clearly distinct types of cross-feeding were identified. a. caccae dsm 14662 was not able to degrade oligofructose but could grow on the fructose released by b. longum bb536  during oligofructose breakdown. r. intestinalis dsm 14610 could degrade oligofructose, but only after acetate was added to the medium. detailed kinetic analyses of oligofructose breakdown by the last strain revealed simultaneous degradation of the different chain length fractions, in contrast with the preferential degradation of shorter fractions by b. longum bb536. in a coculture  of both strains, initial oligofructose degradation and acetate production by b. longum bb536 took place, which in turn also allowed oligofructose breakdown by r. intestinalis dsm 14610. these and similar cross-feeding mechanisms could play a role in the colon ecosystem and contribute to the combined bifidogenic/butyrogenic effect observed after addition of inulin-type fructans to the diet.

TI  == h2 and acetate transfers during xylan fermentation between a butyrate-producing xylanolytic species and hydrogenotrophic microorganisms from the human gut.
AB  == the aim of this work was to investigate in vitro interrelationships during xylan  fermentation between an h2 and butyrate-producing xylanolytic species recently isolated in our laboratory from human faeces and identified as roseburia intestinalis and the h2-utilizing acetogen ruminococcus hydrogenotrophicus or the methanogen methanobrevibacter smithii. h2 transfer between m. smithii or ru. hydrogenotrophicus and the xylanolytic species was evidenced, confirming the great potential of these h2-consuming microorganisms to reutilize fermentative h2 during fibre fermentation in the gut. in addition, acetate transfer was demonstrated between the xylanolytic roseburia sp. and the acetogenic species, both metabolites transfers leading to butyric fermentation of oat xylan without production of h2.

TI  == studies on the effect of system retention time on bacterial populations colonizing a three-stage continuous culture model of the human large gut using fish techniques.
AB  == fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to quantitate bacteria growing in a three-stage continuous culture system inoculated with human faeces, operated at two system retention times (60 and 20 h). twenty-three different 16s rrna gene oligonucleotide probes of varying specificities were used to detect bacteria. organisms belonging to genera bacteroides and bifidobacterium, together with the  eubacterium rectale/clostridium coccoides group, the atopobium, faecalibacterium  prausnitzii and eubacterium cylindroides groups, as well as the segmented filamentous bacteria, the roseburia intestinalis group and lactic acid bacteria,  were all present in high numbers in the continuous culture system. other groups and species such as ruminococci and enterobacteria also persisted in the model, though not always at levels that allowed reliable quantitation. some organisms such as streptococci and corynebacteria, present in the faecal inoculum, did not  colonize the system. other probes specific for eubacterium lentum and for members of the genus desulfovibrio did not detect these organisms at any time. short chain fatty acid production was always highest in vessel i of the continuous culture system, however, a marked increase in acetate formation and a reduction in butyrate production occurred when system retention time was reduced to 20 h, which correlated with reductions in the numbers of butyrate-producing roseburia.

TI  == lactate-utilizing bacteria, isolated from human feces, that produce butyrate as a major fermentation product.
AB  == the microbial community of the human colon contains many bacteria that produce lactic acid, but lactate is normally detected only at low concentrations (<5 mm)  in feces from healthy individuals. it is not clear, however, which bacteria are mainly responsible for lactate utilization in the human colon. here, bacteria able to utilize lactate and produce butyrate were identified among isolates obtained from 10(-8) dilutions of fecal samples from five different subjects. out of nine such strains identified, four were found to be related to eubacterium hallii and two to anaerostipes caccae, while the remaining three represent a new  species within clostridial cluster xiva based on their 16s rrna sequences. significant ability to utilize lactate was not detected in the butyrate-producing species roseburia intestinalis, eubacterium rectale, or faecalibacterium prausnitzii. whereas e. hallii and a. caccae strains used both d- and l-lactate,  the remaining strains used only the d form. addition of glucose to batch cultures prevented lactate utilization until the glucose became exhausted. however, when two e. hallii strains and one a. caccae strain were grown in separate cocultures  with a starch-utilizing bifidobacterium adolescentis isolate, with starch as the  carbohydrate energy source, the l-lactate produced by b. adolescentis became undetectable and butyrate was formed. such cross-feeding may help to explain the  reported butyrogenic effect of certain dietary substrates, including resistant starch. the abundance of e. hallii in particular in the colonic ecosystem suggests that these bacteria play important roles in preventing lactate accumulation.

TI  == oligonucleotide probes that detect quantitatively significant groups of butyrate-producing bacteria in human feces.
AB  == 16s rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes were designed for butyrate-producing bacteria from human feces. three new cluster-specific probes detected bacteria related to roseburia intestinalis, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and eubacterium  hallii at mean populations of 2.3, 3.8, and 0.6%, respectively, in samples from 10 individuals. additional species-level probes accounted for no more than 1%, with a mean of 7.7%, of the total human fecal microbiota identified as butyrate producers in this study. bacteria related to e. hallii and the genera roseburia and faecalibacterium are therefore among the most abundant known butyrate-producing bacteria in human feces.

TI  == roseburia intestinalis sp. nov., a novel saccharolytic, butyrate-producing bacterium from human faeces.
AB  == five strains of butyrate-producing, anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria were isolated from human faecal material. these strains were slightly curved rods that showed motility by means of multiple subterminal flagella. the dna g + c content  of the strains was 29-31 mol%. a detailed investigation of the phenotypic and phylogenetic characteristics of the strains revealed that they represent a novel  species of anaerobic, low-g+c-content, butyrate-producing bacterium that shows net acetate utilization during growth on media containing carbohydrates and short-chain fatty acids. the 16s rrna gene sequences of the five isolates were determined and they confirmed that these strains were closely related to each other. phylogenetic analysis indicated that the most closely related species are  eubacterium rectale, eubacterium oxidoreducens and roseburia cecicola, members of cluster xiva of the clostridium subphylum of gram-positive bacteria, although they share less than 95% sequence identity with the novel strains. it is proposed that a novel species, roseburia intestinalis sp. nov., be created, with strain l1-82t (= dsm 14610t = ncimb 13810t) as the type strain.
