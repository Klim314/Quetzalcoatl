TI  == characterization of the vaginal microbiota of healthy canadian women through the  menstrual cycle.
AB  == background: the vaginal microbial community plays a vital role in maintaining women's health. understanding the precise bacterial composition is challenging because of the diverse and difficult-to-culture nature of many bacterial constituents, necessitating culture-independent methodology. during a natural menstrual cycle, physiological changes could have an impact on bacterial growth,  colonization, and community structure. the objective of this study was to assess  the stability of the vaginal microbiome of healthy canadian women throughout a menstrual cycle by using cpn60-based microbiota analysis. vaginal swabs from 27 naturally cycling reproductive-age women were collected weekly through a single menstrual cycle. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was performed to amplify the universal target region of the cpn60 gene and generate amplicons representative of the microbial community. amplicons were pyrosequenced, assembled into operational taxonomic units, and analyzed. samples were also assayed for total 16s rrna gene content and gardnerella vaginalis by quantitative pcr and screened  for the presence of mollicutes by using family and genus-specific pcr. results: overall, the vaginal microbiome of most women remained relatively stable throughout the menstrual cycle, with little variation in diversity and only modest fluctuations in species richness. microbiomes between women were more different than were those collected consecutively from individual women. clustering of microbial profiles revealed the expected groupings dominated by lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners, and lactobacillus jensenii. interestingly, two additional clusters were dominated by either bifidobacterium breve or a heterogeneous mixture of nonlactobacilli. direct g. vaginalis quantification correlated strongly with its pyrosequencing-read abundance, and mollicutes, including mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma parvum, and ureaplasma urealyticum, were detected in most samples. conclusions: our cpn60-based investigation of the vaginal microbiome demonstrated that in healthy women most vaginal microbiomes remained stable through their menstrual cycle. of interest in these findings was the presence of bifidobacteriales beyond just gardnerella species. bifidobacteriales are frequently underrepresented in 16s rrna gene-based studies, and their detection by cpn60-based investigation suggests that their significance in the vaginal community may be underappreciated.

TI  == bead-based multiplex sexually transmitted infection profiling.
AB  == objectives: sexually transmitted infections are a significant cause of genital disease, infertility and hospital admissions. the economic impact is high. an accurate diagnosis is often difficult and time consuming. we report the development and validation of a novel bead-based multiplex sexually transmitted infection profiling (stip) assay that detects 18 sexually transmitted infections  using a multiplex pcr followed by luminex bead-based hybridisation. methods: stip was validated using urogenital samples pretested by commercially available quantitative pcr, microscopy or by culturing methods. results: stip specifically  detects chlamydia trachomatis, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, treponema pallidum,  trichomonas vaginalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, mycoplasma (m.) genitalium, m. hominis, m. pneumonia, m. spermatophilum, ureaplasma urealyticum and u. parvum, and quantifies bacterial vaginosis-associated atopobium vaginae and gardnerella vaginalis as well as three candida species and normal genital flora-associated lactobacillus species. stip reached an overall concordance of 95-100% with commercially available quantitative pcr tests. compared to nugent score, stip reached a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 86% for bacterial vaginosis detection. candida specimens, pretested by direct culturing, were identified with a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 99%. conclusions: stip is a powerful high-throughput tool in assessing a broad spectrum of urogenital infections.

TI  == subtle perturbations of genital microflora alter mucosal immunity among low-risk  pregnant women.
AB  == objective: alteration in the vaginal flora has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. the objective of this study was to examine the impact of changes in individual microflora on genital immunity among low-risk pregnant women in early pregnancy. design: cross-sectional study. setting: large, tertiary care, academic hospital clinic. population: low-risk women were enrolled prior to 14 weeks' gestation. methods: women were included if they had no medical or previous obstetrical complications, were non-smokers, had no sexually transmitted infections and no intercourse in the last 48 hours. consenting women underwent speculum examination for collection of vaginal culture and dacron swabs for cytokine analysis. semi-quantitative vaginal cultures were performed in a reference laboratory. main outcome measures: concentrations of immune mediators were compared in the presence of various organisms. concentrations were converted to multiples of the median to standardize the values of each mediator. regression analyses were performed to control for race. results: we enrolled 47 women. the frequencies of genital microorganisms were: h(2)o(2) -producing lactobacilli (70%), ureaplasma urealyticum (66%), gardnerella vaginalis (45%), anaerobic non-pigmented gram-negative rods (anpgnr, 40%), anaerobic pigmented gram-negative rods (apgnr, 17%). after adjusting for race and body mass index, interleukin-1beta, interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and granulocyte  macrophage-colony stimulating factor were increased in the presence of g. vaginalis, anpgnr, and apgnr. there was no consistent impact on the other markers of immune activation. conclusion: the presence of individual species impacts genital immunity among low-risk pregnant women. perturbations in genital immunity could partially explain heterogeneity in adverse pregnancy outcomes.

TI  == molecular quantification of gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae loads to  predict bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a poorly detected public health problem that is associated with preterm delivery and for which no reliable diagnostic tool exists. methods: molecular analysis of 231 vaginal samples, classified by gram stain-based nugent score, was used to propose molecular criteria for bv; these criteria were prospectively applied to 56 new samples. a quantitative molecular tool targeting 8 bv-related microorganisms and a human gene was developed using a specific real-time polymerase chain reaction assay and serial dilutions of a plasmid suspension. the targeted microorganisms were gardnerella vaginalis, lactobacillus species, mobiluncus curtisii, mobiluncus mulieris, and candida albicans (which can be identified by gram staining), as well as atopobium vaginae, mycoplasma hominis, and ureaplasma urealyticum (which cannot be detected by gram staining). results: with use of the nugent score, 167 samples were classified as normal, 20 were classified as bv, and 44 were classified as intermediate. except for u. urealyticum, m. mulieris, and lactobacillus species,  dna of the tested bacteria was detected more frequently in samples demonstrating  bv, but the predictive value of such detection was low. the molecular quantification of a. vaginae (dna level, > or = 10(8) copies/ml) and g. vaginalis (dna level, > or = 10(9) copies/ml) had the highest predictive value for the diagnosis of bv, with excellent sensitivity (95%), specificity (99%), and positive (95%) and negative (99%) predictive values; 25 (57%) of the samples demonstrating intermediate flora had a bv profile. when applied prospectively, our molecular criteria had total positive and negative predictive values of 96% and 99%, respectively. conclusions: we report a highly reproducible, quantitative tool to objectively analyze vaginal flora that uses cutoff values for the concentrations of a. vaginae and g. vaginalis to establish the molecular diagnosis of bv.

TI  == [vaginosis in patients with antenatal foetus death].
AB  == polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis of bacterial vaginosis as well as of vaginal anaerobe flora (mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, gardnerella vaginalis, bacteroides spp. and mobiluncus curtisii) was performed in women with  antenatal foetus death. specimens from forty women with this pathology were studied. control group consisted of 100 pregnant women of the adequate age groups and gestation periods, but with live foetus. vaginal smears treated by the use of polymerase chain reaction method showed that in the cases of antenatal foetus death in 70% of women lactobacillus spp. was completely absent. this bacterium was observed only in 30% of these women. in 75% of women with live foetus lactobacillus spp. was observed, while in 25% it was not present. increase of quantity of anaerobic vaginal flora was observed in women, where the antenatal death of foetus was diagnosed. percentage significance of these indices in women  with live foetus was comparatively lower.

TI  == a cluster analysis of bacterial vaginosis-associated microflora and pelvic inflammatory disease.
AB  == controversy surrounds the association between bacterial vaginosis (bv) and pelvic inflammatory disease (pid). women (n = 1,140) were ascertained at five us centers, enrolled (1999-2001), and followed up for a median of 3 years. serial vaginal swabs were obtained for gram's stain and cultures. pid was defined as 1)  histologic endometritis or 2) pelvic pain and tenderness plus oral temperature >38.8 degrees c, leukorrhea or mucopus, erythrocyte sedimentation rate >15 mm/hour, white blood cell count >10,000, or gonococcal/chlamydial lower genital infection. exploratory factor analysis identified two discrete clusters of genital microorganisms. the first correlated with bv by gram's stain and consisted of the absence of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus, gardnerella vaginalis, mycoplasma hominis, anaerobic gram-negative rods, and, to  a lesser degree, ureaplasma urealyticum. the second, unrelated to bv by gram's stain, consisted of enterococcus species and escherichia coli. being in the highest tertile in terms of growth of bv-associated microorganisms increased pid  risk (adjusted rate ratio = 2.03, 95% confidence interval: 1.16, 3.53). carriage  of non-bv-associated microorganisms did not increase pid risk. women with heavy growth of bv-associated microorganisms and a new sexual partner appeared to be at particularly high risk (adjusted rate ratio = 8.77, 95% confidence interval: 1.11, 69.2). when identified by microbial culture, a combination of bv-related microorganisms significantly elevated the risk of acquiring pid.

TI  == characterization of vaginal flora and bacterial vaginosis in women who have sex with women.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) may be common among women who report having sex with women (wsw) and frequently occurs in both members of monogamous couples. the results of gram staining of a vaginal smear were consistent with bv in 81 (25%) and intermediate in 37 (11%) of 326 wsw included in this study. lactobacilli were detected in 64% of subjects, and 42% of subjects had h(2)o(2)-producing strains.  bv was associated with a higher lifetime number of female sex partners, failure to always clean an insertive sex toy before use, and oral-anal sex with female partners. neither recent douching nor sexual practices with male partners were associated with bv. vaginal smears from each partner were concordant in 55 (95%)  of 58 monogamous couples; bv was present in both partners in 16 couples (28%) (p<.001, compared with expected distribution). bv was common among subjects who did not douche, who did not have concurrent sex with male partners, or who did not have a new sex partner, which suggests that other risk factors for bv exist.  these data support the hypothesis that sexual exchange of vaginal secretions is a possible mechanism for acquisition of bv.

TI  == predictors of the vaginal microflora.
AB  == objective: our purpose was to define influences on the patterns of the vaginal microflora. study design: we enrolled 617 african american and mexican american women in a 1-year longitudinal study of sexual behaviors and the vaginal microflora on the basis of the presence of gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, trichomoniasis, or syphilis at the initial visit. the patients were assigned randomly to a behavioral intervention or standard counseling regarding sexually transmitted disease. we reevaluated 508 (82%) and 549 (89%) women at 6 and 12 months, respectively. a comprehensive survey of lower genital tract organisms was conducted at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. behavioral and microbiologic associations were screened by bivariate analysis. all variables associated with an organism at p < or = .15 were included in a multivariate analysis. associations between behavior and the genital tract microflora were identified by logistic regression coefficients with p <.05. results: african american race had  a consistent association with vaginal microflora, specifically, mycoplasma hominis, trichomonas vaginalis, bacterial vaginosis, group b streptococci, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and chlamydia trachomatis. various behaviors had a less consistent effect, including multiple partners, douching, frequency of coitus >3  times a week, and cunnilingus, fellatio, and anal intercourse at the last sexual  encounter. m hominis (but not ureaplasma urealyticum ), gardnerella vaginalis, and lactobacillus species were associated with bacterial vaginosis. lactobacillus species appeared to protect against bacterial vaginosis and infection with g vaginalis. sexually transmitted diseases (caused by m hominis, n gonorrhoeae, c trachomatis, and t vaginalis ) were associated with each other. in contrast, hormonal status, vaginal blood, and foreign bodies had little effect. conclusion: the presence of other microorganisms and race have a more consistent association  with the presence or absence of a cervical-vaginal organism than sexual behavior, hormonal status, vaginal devices, or the presence of abnormal vaginal bleeding.

TI  == detection of cervical immunoglobulin a in normal pregnancy.
AB  == the aim of our study was to evaluate a feasible method to quantify the immunoglobulin a concentration in the cervical mucus of women with a normal singleton pregnancy. in 60 immunologic healthy pregnant women cervical mucus samples were taken at a random time in pregnancy using an absorbing cylindrical cotton-swab stick. in this cervical mucus immunoglobulin a concentration was measured by radial immunodiffusion. a vaginal bacterial swab was taken from each  woman. concentration of immunoglobulins in maternal serum was estimated. there was no statistically significant difference of cervical immunoglobulin a concentration between the investigated groups (p = 0.952): 18-24 gestational weeks (gw): 52.8 (6.6-258.4) mg/l; 25-29 gw: 89.3 (4.8-193.8) mg/l; 30-34 gw: 55  (1.4-326) mg/l; 35-40 gw: 59.2 (4-400.9) mg/l. women with a normal vaginal flora  showed a significantly higher cervical immunoglobulin a concentration than those  with a pathological colonization: 92.2 (6.6-400.9) mg/l vs. 42.5 (1.4-326) mg/l (p < 0.05). the serum levels of immunoglobulins a, a1, a2, m and g do not correlate to cervical immunoglobulin a levels nor to gestational age. in normal pregnancy, cervical immunoglobulin a concentration does not change with advancing gestational age, but a pathological vaginal colonization seems to be associated with decreased immunoglobulin a levels.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis a "broad overview".
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) was first reported in 1995 by gardner and dukes, who described the unique clinical signs and symptoms and the distinctive nature of the vaginal discharge associated with it. they also described a "new" causative organism, which they named "haemophilus vaginalis", subsequently renamed gardnerella vaginalis. bv is currently the most prevalent cause of infectious vaginitis among women attending for genitourinary diseases. bv has a complex microbiology. lactobacillus populations, which are usually dominant in healthy women, are replaced by a polymicrobial group of organisms that includes g. vaginalis, anaerobic gram-negative rods such as prevotella species, peptostreptococcus species, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, and often mobiluncus species. anaerobic bacteria produce enzymes, aminopeptidases, that degrade protein and decarboxylases that convert amino acids and other compounds to amines. those amines contribute to the signs and symptoms associated with the  syndrome, raising the vaginal ph and producing a discharge odor. the excessive amounts of bacteria characteristic of the syndrome attach to epithelial cell surfaces, resulting in "clue cell". nearly half the patients report no noticeable symptoms, but many develop a characteristic copious, malodorous discharge if untreated. results from epidemiologic studies have associated bv with serious upper genital tract infections and adverse pregnancy outcome. in particular, the  presence of bv in pregnant women increases the risk of preterm delivery, and evidence is now compelling that bv is a cause of preterm delivery. the interest in potential invasiveness of g. vaginalis has increased. however, virulence determinants have not been studied enough. the most important therapy includes clindamycin and metronidazole.

TI  == a quantitative microbiological study of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == a quantitative microbial study of vaginal secretions from 100 women with bacterial vaginosis (bv) and 50 healthy women matched for age, was undertaken. this was aimed at comparing the bacterial flora colonising the vagina of sexually active asymptomatic women with those with bv and correlating bacterial counts with presence of symptoms. of the total 475 bacteria isolated anaerobes were predominant among controls and among patients aerobes and anaerobes had equal prevalences. the increased viable counts of all anaerobes (> 10(7) cfu/g) were related with symptoms. mobiluncus mulieris could be isolated from one patient and chlamydia trachomatis antigen was absent in all samples tested. bacteroides, g. vaginalis and ureaplasma urealyticum were found to be the most commonly occurring group in women with bv. lactobacillus, and probably coryneforms have a protective role in health, preventing disease.

TI  == variability of polymerase chain reaction-based detection of human papillomavirus  dna is associated with the composition of vaginal microbial flora.
AB  == the results of repeated human papillomavirus (hpv) dna testing were compared to changes in cervical pathology and the composition of vaginal microorganisms. a cohort of 19 women with hpv cervical infections in the absence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia at enrollment was reexamined on average at 7.3-month intervals over a 2-year period. at each follow-up visit, cytological and colposcopic examinations were done and vaginal microorganisms were assessed quantitatively by gram staining of secretions, and anaerobic and aerobic culture. hpv genotypes 6, 11, 16, and 18 were detected by polymerase chain reaction analysis using dna isolated from exfoliated cervical cells. the detection of hpv  dna was significantly associated with carriage of grade ii flora (p < 0.001), isolation of gardnerella vaginalis (p = 0.03), ureaplasma urealyticum (p = 0.04), candida albicans (p = 0.01), bacteroides species (p = 0.01), and overgrowth by anaerobes (p = 0.004). normal vaginal flora, characterised by the predominance of lactobacillus species, was significantly associated (p < 0.001) with a negative hpv test. the detection of hpv dna is associated with the composition of microorganisms present in the vagina at the time of testing.

TI  == the microbiology of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == a group of microorganisms are present concurrently in high concentrations in the  vaginas of women with bacterial vaginosis. the major members of the group are gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic gram-negative rods belonging to the genera prevotella, porphyromonas and bacteroides, peptostreptococcus species, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, and often mobiluncus species. facultative species of lactobacillus are present in lower concentrations and are less prevalent in bacterial vaginosis than in women with a normal vaginal examination. the exact microbe(s) responsible for bacterial vaginosis is unknown whether among the organisms listed above or an unknown agent. the high concentrations of anaerobic gram-negative rods, peptostreptococci, and other opportunistic pathogens in the lower genital tract place women with bacterial vaginosis at increased risk for genital infections and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

TI  == the normal vaginal flora, h2o2-producing lactobacilli, and bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women.
AB  == in this study of the vaginal flora of 171 pregnant women in labor at term, the flora was categorized as normal (lactobacillus predominant), intermediate, or representative of bacterial vaginosis (bv) on the basis of a vaginal smear. bv was diagnosed in 39 women (23%); the vaginal flora was classified as normal in 50% of cases and as intermediate in 27%. h2o2-producing lactobacilli were recovered from 5% of women with bv, 37% of those with an intermediate flora, and  61% of those with a normal flora. h2o2-negative lactobacilli were equally frequent (57%-65%) in all three groups. the microorganisms most frequently recovered from women with bv included gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia/disiens, bacteroides ureolyticus, prevotella corporis/bacteroides levii, fusobacterium nucleatum, mobiluncus species, peptostreptococcus prevotii, peptostreptococcus tetradius, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, viridans streptococci, ureaplasma urealyticum, and mycoplasma hominis (p < .05 for each).  the presence of all but three of these organisms was inversely related to vaginal colonization by h2o2-producing lactobacilli; the exceptions were b. ureolyticus,  f. nucleatum, and p. prevotii. other microorganisms were equally frequent among women with and without bv. we conclude that specific groups of anaerobes are associated with bv in this population and that a strong association exists between species associated with bv and those inhibited by h2o2-producing lactobacilli.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and spectrum of rifaximin, a new topical rifamycin derivative.
AB  == rifaximin, a rifamycin derivative, was evaluated in vitro to assess its spectrum  and potency against a wide variety of bacteria, yeasts, viruses, and parasites. high concentrations of rifaximin were often used to reflect topically achieved levels since this compound is poorly absorbed by oral route. like rifampin, rifaximin possessed best activity against staphylococcus spp. (mic50 < or = 0.015 microgram/ml), streptococcus spp. (mic50s, < or = 0.03-0.12 microgram/ml), enterococcus spp. (mic50s, 0.25-2 micrograms/ml), bacillus cereus (mic50, 0.06 microgram/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic50, < or = 0.03 microgram/ml), and haemophilus influenzae (mic50, 0.25 microgram/ml). rifaximin demonstrated potential use as a topical agent for bacterial vaginosis by inhibiting bacteroides bivius-disiens, gardnerella vaginalis, lactobacillus spp., and mobiluncus spp. strains (all mics < or = 1 microgram/ml). strains of haemophilus  ducreyi and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mic50s, 0.25 microgram/ml) were also inhibited. however, some organisms associated with genital tract infections were  rifaximin resistant, for example, candida spp., herpes virus, mycoplasmas, trichomonas vaginalis, and ureaplasma urealyticum. clinical trials appear warranted using rifaximin topical concentrations that will minimize mutations to  rifamycin resistance.

TI  == the relationship of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli to bacterial vaginosis and genital microflora in pregnant women.
AB  == lactobacilli provide an important microbial defense against genital colonization  by pathogens. the role of hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) in the control of genital microflora was explored in a cross-sectional study of 275 women in the second trimester of pregnancy. vaginal cultures were obtained for detection of h2o2-positive and h2o2-negative lactobacilli and other members of the genital microflora. compared with women with h2o2-negative lactobacilli, women colonized  by h2o2-positive lactobacilli were less likely to have bacterial vaginosis, symptomatic candidiasis, and vaginal colonization by gardnerella vaginalis, bacteroides, peptostreptococcus, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, and  viridans streptococci (p less than or equal to .05 for each comparison). in addition to the above organisms, women without vaginal lactobacilli were more likely than those women with h2o2-positive lactobacilli to have chlamydia trachomatis, and less likely to be colonized by enterococcus or coagulase-negative staphylococci (p less than .05 for each comparison). vaginal colonization by group b streptococci or escherichia coli was not related to the presence of h2o2-positive lactobacilli. these data suggest that the presence of h2o2-positive lactobacilli in the vagina is inversely correlated with infection by some genital pathogens in pregnant women.

TI  == the midcycle cervical microbial flora as studied by the weighed-swab method, and  its possible correlation with results of sperm cervical mucus penetration tests.
AB  == infertile couples undergoing routine investigation for infertility were randomly  selected for the study. a quantitative method using weighed swabs was found satisfactory for the study of microbial flora in the midcycle cervical mucus. in  6 of the 20 women, the midcycle cervical mucus was hostile in the sperm cervical  mucus penetration tests. the total bacterial counts and the number of species (average, 2.5) isolated from the hostile mucus were significantly greater than those from the receptive mucus (average, 1.3). only normal vaginal/cervical flora was isolated. ureaplasma urealyticum was found more frequently in patients undergoing clomiphene citrate therapy (6/10 versus 0/9, p less than 0.03, fischer's exact test).

TI  == microbiology of the lower genital tract in postmenarchal adolescent girls: differences by sexual activity, contraception, and presence of nonspecific vaginitis.
AB  == the prevalence of selected microorganisms in the lower genital tract in postmenarchal adolescent girls was assessed, including vaginal gardnerella vaginalis, group b streptococcus, lactobacillus, mycoplasma species, ureaplasma urealyticum, staphylococcus aureus, and yeast, and endocervical mycoplasma species, u. urealyticum, chlamydia trachomatis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and trichomonas vaginalis. specific attention was focused on important sexually transmitted disease organisms, and differences in isolations by age, sexual activity, ethnicity, contraception, and the diagnosis of nonspecific vaginitis were measured. sexually active subjects had a mean of 6.05 organisms (sd = 3.16), compared with 3.12 organisms (sd = 3.92) in non-sexually active subjects (p = 0.001). sexually active subjects had significantly more vaginal g. vaginalis, lactobacilli, mycoplasma species, and u. urealyticum, as well as endocervical mycoplasma species and u. urealyticum, compared with non-sexually active subjects; c. trachomatis, n. gonorrhoea, and t. vaginalis were isolated exclusively from the sexually active group. significant differences in isolation  rates by ethnicity were found in vaginal mycoplasma species and u. urealyticum, and endocervical mycoplasma species, u. urealyticum, c. trachomatis, n. gonorrhoeae, and t. vaginalis. in general, organisms were isolated from blacks most frequently; n. gonorrhoea was isolated from blacks exclusively. differences  were found in microbiologic isolations by the presence or absence of nonspecific  vaginitis. vaginal g. vaginalis and mycoplasma species and endocervical mycoplasma species and u. urealyticum were found significantly more often in isolates from the group with nonspecific vaginitis. it is important to define the microbial flora of the lower genital tract in adolescent girls in order to understand its role in the pathogenesis of acute salpingitis.
