TI  - Screening of Lactobacillus strains of domestic goose origin against bacterial poultry pathogens for use as probiotics.
AB  - Lactobacilli are natural inhabitants of human and animal mucous membranes, including the avian gastrointestinal tract. Recently, increasing attention has been given to their probiotic, health-promoting capacities, among which their antagonistic potential against pathogens plays a key role. A study was conducted to evaluate probiotic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from feces or cloacae of domestic geese. Among the 104 examined isolates, previously identified to the species level by whole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and analysis of 16S-23S regions of rDNA, dominated Lactobacillus salivarius (35%), followed by Lactobacillus johnsonii (18%) and Lactobacillus ingluviei (11%). All lactobacilli were screened for antimicrobial activity toward Salmonella Enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Pasteurella multocida, and Riemerella anatipestifer using the agar slab method and the well diffusion method. Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus plantarum exhibited particularly strong antagonism toward all of the indicator strains. In the agar slab method, the highest sensitivity to Lactobacillus was observed in R. anatipestifer and P. multocida, and the lowest in E. coli and S. aureus. The ability to produce H(2)O(2)was exhibited by 92% of isolates, but there was no correlation between the rate of production of this reactive oxygen species and the antimicrobial activity of Lactobacillus sp. All lactobacilli showed resistance to pH 3.0 and 3.5 and to 2% bile. The data demonstrate that Lactobacillus isolates from geese may have probiotic potential in reducing bacterial infections. The antibacterial activity of the selected lactobacilli is mainly due to lactic acid production by these bacteria. The selected Lactobacillus strains that strongly inhibited the growth of pathogenic bacteria, and were also resistant to low pH and bile salts, can potentially restore the balance of intestinal microflora in geese and could offer an alternative to antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Pharmacological evidence for activation of phospholipid and small GTP binding protein signalling cascades by Nod factors.
AB  - The effects of lipo-chitin oligosaccharide Nod factors (NodNGR[S] from Rhizobium  sp. NGR234) on root hair deformation in Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp. were studied using pharmacological agents to mimic and/or inhibit their action. It was hypothesised that the rearrangement of the cytoskeleton seen during Nod factor induced root hair deformation is modulated by protein kinase C, monomeric G proteins of the Rho superfamily and the location and amount of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphates (PI3Ps). This hypothesis is supported by the following observations. The protein kinase C activators, 12-deoxyphorbol 13-acetate (DPA) and diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor 1, stimulated root hair deformation to a level similar to that seen with Nod factors or mastoparan, whereas the inhibitor Go 6976 inhibited root hair deformations induced by NodNGR[S], mastoparan, DPA and diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor 1. The Ras antagonists mevastatin and sulindac sulphide, and the Rho antagonist exoenzyme C3 toxin from Clostridium botulinum all inhibited Nod factor stimulated root hair deformation. Pasteurella multocida toxin activates Rho and stimulated root hair deformation, this stimulation was inhibited by both neomycin and exoenzyme C3 toxin. The PI3 kinase inhibitors, wortmannin and LY-294002 attenuated Nod factor induced root hair deformation. These studies were complemented with actin immunoprecipitations of root hair enriched microsomal membrane preparations from V. unguiculata which pulled down small GTP binding proteins. Root hair deformation is an important early stage in the formation of nitrogen fixing nodules and this study highlights that these processes may depend on signalling cascades involving phospholipids and small GTP binding proteins.
