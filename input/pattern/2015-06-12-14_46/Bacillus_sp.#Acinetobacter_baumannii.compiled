TI  - Production of humic substances through coal-solubilizing bacteria.
AB  - In this paper, the production of humic substances (HS) through the bacterial solubilization of low rank coal (LRC) was evaluated. The evaluation was carried out by 19 bacterial strains isolated in microenvironments with high contents of coal wastes. The biotransformed LRC and the HS produced were quantified in vitro in a liquid growth medium. The humic acids (HA) obtained from the most active bacterial strain were characterized via elemental composition (C, H, N, O), IR analyses, and the E4/E6 ratio; they were then compared with the HA extracted chemically using NaOH. There was LRC biotransformation ranged from 25 to 37%, and HS production ranged from 127 to 3100 mg . L(-1). More activity was detected in the isolated strains of Bacillus mycoides, Microbacterium sp, Acinetobacter sp, and Enterobacter aerogenes. The HA produced by B. mycoides had an IR spectrum and an E4/E6 ratio similar to those of the HA extracted with NAOH, but their elemental composition and their degree of aromatic condensation was different. Results suggest that these bacteria can be used to exploit the LRC resulting from coal mining activities and thus produce HS in order to improve the content of humified organic matter in soils.
TI  - Microstructure, microbial profile and quality characteristics of high-pressure-treated chicken nuggets.
AB  - High-pressure processing (300 MPa for 5 min) as a non-thermal post-processing intervention was employed to improve the shelf life and qualities of cooked refrigerated chicken nuggets. Pomegranate peel extract (1%) was also used as a source of natural antioxidant and antimicrobial in chicken nuggets. Microstructure, microbial profile, instrumental colour, texture profile and lipid oxidation were evaluated. High-pressure treatment and pomegranate peel extract did not influence significantly the colour and textural properties of cooked chicken nuggets. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substance values significantly (p < 0.05) increased in pressure-treated nuggets. Microstructural studies revealed shrinkage in the structure and loosening of the dense network of meat emulsion due to high-pressure treatment. Pressure treatment resulted in a reduction of 2-3.0 log10 cfu/g in total plate count and Enterobacteriaceae count. Molecular characterization studies revealed that Enterobacter amnigenus and Enterobacter sp. in control and Bacillus licheniformis, Enterococcus gallinarum and Acinetobacter baumannii in high-pressure-treated chicken nuggets were the major spoilage bacteria.
TI  - Molecular identification of antagonistic bacteria from Tehran soils and evaluation of their inhibitory activities toward pathogenic fungi.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To find antagonistic bacteria with potential antifungal activity against some pathogenic fungi, including Aspergillus niger, A. flavus, Fusarium moniliforme and Penicillium marneffei, a total of 148 agricultural soil samples from different sites of Tehran were examined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antagonistic soils were selected by screening against A. niger on glucose-yeast extract (GY) agar using a visual agar plate assay method. All growing bacteria were examined for antifungal activity, and antagonistic bacteria identified based on 16S rRNA sequence analysis. Among a total number of 97 bacteria isolated form inhibitory soils (36 samples), 16 bacteria were reported as strong growth inhibitors in co-cultures on GY agar with all tested fungi at variable degrees. Fungal growth inhibitory bacteria were cultured against all fungi and growth inhibition was measured and analyzed between test and control groups by statistical analysis (ANOVA). RESULTS: Molecular identification of antagonistic bacteria indicated that most bacterial isolates belonged to the genus Bacillus (81.25%), including B. subtilis (5 isolates), B. amyloliquefaciens (6 isolates) and B. valismortis (2 isolates), followed by one isolate (6.25%) from each Streptomyces sp., Pseudomonas chlororaphis and Acinetobacter baumannii. Based on the visual plate assay results, total fungal growth inhibition of all bacteria was reported in the range of 13.2 to 68.3%. P. chlororaphis S105 was reported as the most potent antagonistic bacterium which inhibited the growth of A. niger by 68.3%, followed by F. moniliforme (66.4%), A. flavus (64.7%) and P. marneffei (57.1%). CONCLUSION: P. chlororaphis and some other inhibitory bacteria reported in the present study, they may be considered not only as a rich source of useful metabolites with potential application in antifungal drug discovery, but also as potential candidates for biological control programs.
TI  - Phytochemical constituents and antibacterial efficacy of the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum (DC.) Baker ex Heyne.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the preliminary phytochemistry and antibacterial activity of the flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum . METHODS: Phytochemical analysis was done by using the standard methods given by Harbone. The methanolic flower extract were tested against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi, Serratia marsecens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes by the agar disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Preliminary phytochemical screening of flower extract showed the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, tannins, xanthoproteins, carboxylic acids, coumarins and carbohydrates. The flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum showed significant activity against four gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes) and three gram negative bacteria (Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii and Serratia marsecens), out of 12 pathogenic bacteria studied. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study confirm the presence of significant antibacterial activity against human pathogens in the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum.
TI  - Identification of Streptomyces sp. KH29, which produces an antibiotic substance processing an inhibitory activity against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - The Actinomycete strain KH29 is antagonistic to the multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Based on the diaminopimelic acid (DAP) type, and the morphological and physiological characteristics observed through the use of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), KH29 was confirmed as belonging to the genus Streptomyces. By way of its noted 16S rDNA nucleotide sequences, KH29 was found to have a relationship with Streptomyces cinnamonensis. The production of an antibiotic from this strain was found to be most favorable when cultured with glucose, polypeptone, and yeast extract (PY) medium for 6 days at 27 degrees C. The antibiotic produced was identified, through comparisons with reported spectral data including MS and NMR as a cyclo(L-tryptophanyl-L-tryptophanyl). Cyclo(L-Trp-L-Trp), from the PY cultures of KH29, was seen to be highly effective against 41 of 49 multidrugresistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Furthermore, cyclo(LTrp- L-Trp) had antimicrobial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus niger, and Candida albicans, However, it was ineffective against Streptomyces murinus.
TI  - [Changes in the bacterial spectrum in severe burn wounds].
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the time axis for increase in Gram negative bacterial strains in burn wounds during hospitalization. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty-five patients hospitalized at the Clinic of burns and reconstructive surgery between 2006 and 2008 were enrolled in the study. The major criteria for enrolment were more than 15% of total body surface area (TBSA) burned, hospital stay of 1 month or more and age over 18 years. Specimens for microbiological examination were collected on days 2, 6, 10, 14 and 20 after admission. RESULTS: A total of 777 bacterial strains were isolated from the study patients, with 64.6% of these strains being Gram positive and 35.4% Gram negative. The most frequently isolated Gram positive pathogens were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (260 strains) and Bacillus sp. (113 strains), while the most common Gram negative pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (81 strains), Escherichia coli (63 strains) and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex (57 strains). CONCLUSION: The study provided data that supports the assumption of increase in Gram negative bacterial strains in burn wounds during hospitalization. Nevertheless, even on day 20 after admission, such strains did not predominate.
TI  - [Toxigenic effect of Acinetobacter baumannii isolated from children with acute diarrhoea].
AB  - Diarrheal diseases with diarrhea are the most frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in children; however the causative agent cannot be identified always, which suggests the presence of unknown enteropathogens inducing diarrhea. The isolation of Acinetobacter sp. from feces of children with acute diarrhea, unrelated to known enteropathogens motivated this investigation to detect a possible enterotoxigenic effect on HT-29 cells. The study population comprised 150 children with an age range from 0 to 5 years old; 120 were assisted in the "Hospital Materno Infantil del Este'' with gastrointestinal syndrome and 30 healthy controls who went to the center for routine analysis. In 25% of symptomatic patients were diagnosed parasites and bacteria, identified routinely. From four symptomatic patients were isolated three Acinetobacter baumannii strains and two A. calcoaceticus strains. The strains were cultured in brain-heart infusion for 24 and 48 hrs, at 35 degrees C, and the supernatants were obtained by centrifugation and filtration and their activity tested on HT-29 cell monolayers. The supernatants of the three strains of A. baumannii induced alterations of the cell monolayer, showed by detachments of cell monolayers, cell segregation, cell rounding and swelling. These effects were more intense with the 48 h culture exoproducts of the 016 strain, which were higher than the positive control. This toxigenic effect of A. baumannii, could represent a pathogenic mechanism whose definition requires more studies to determine the possible role in the pathogenicity of this bacillus.
