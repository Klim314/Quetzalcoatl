TI  - Levels of Selenomonas species in generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To compare the levels of Selenomonas sputigena and uncultivated/unrecognized Selenomonas species in subgingival biofilms from periodontally healthy subjects and from subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifteen periodontally healthy subjects and 15 subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis were recruited and their clinical periodontal parameters were evaluated. Nine subgingival plaque samples were collected from each subject and all were individually analyzed for the levels of 10 bacterial taxa, including cultured and uncultivated/unrecognized microorganisms, using the RNA-oligonucleotide quantification technique. Between-group differences in the levels of the test taxa were determined using the Mann-Whitney U-test. RESULTS: Subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis showed significantly higher mean counts of Porphyromonas gingivalis, S. sputigena and the Mitsuokella sp. Human Oral Taxon (HOT) 131 (previously described as Selenomonas sp. oral clone CS002), while higher mean counts of Actinomyces gerencseriae and Streptococcus sanguinis were found in periodontally healthy subjects (p < 0.01). Selenomonas sp. HOT 146 was only detected in the generalized aggressive periodontitis group. In the generalized aggressive periodontitis group, the levels of P. gingivalis and S. sputigena were higher in deep sites (probing depth >/= 5 mm) than in shallow sites (probing depth </= 3 mm) (p < 0.01). Furthermore, in subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis, sites with probing depth of </= 3 mm harbored higher levels of these two species than sites with the same probing depth in periodontally healthy subjects. There were positive correlations between probing depth and the levels of P. gingivalis (r = 0.77; p < 0.01), S. sputigena (r = 0.60; p < 0.01) and Selenomonas dianae (previously described as Selenomonas sp. oral clone EW076) (r = 0.42, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: S. sputigena and Mitsuokella sp. HOT 131 may be associated with the pathogenesis of generalized aggressive periodontitis, and their role in the onset and progression of this infection should be investigated further.
TI  - Comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (RP) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (GRs = good responders) or periodontal health (PH) using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM). METHODS: At baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with PH and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM. The subjects with periodontitis were classified as having RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or more than three sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GRs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after treatment. Significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis and chi(2) tests. RESULTS: More species were detected in patients with disease (GR or RP) than in those without disease (PH). Subjects with RP were distinguished from GRs or those with PH by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Campylobacter gracilis, Eubacterium nodatum, Selenomonas noxia, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Treponema spp., and Eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, TM7 spp. oral taxon [OT] 346/356, Bacteroidetes sp. OT 272/274, Solobacterium moorei, Desulfobulbus sp. OT 041, Brevundimonas diminuta, Sphaerocytophaga sp. OT 337, Shuttleworthia satelles, Filifactor alocis, Dialister invisus/pneumosintes, Granulicatella adiacens, Mogibacterium timidum, Veillonella atypica, Mycoplasma salivarium, Synergistes sp. cluster II, and Acidaminococcaceae [G-1] sp. OT 132/150/155/148/135) (P <0.05). Species that were more prevalent in subjects with PH than in patients with periodontitis included Actinomyces sp. OT 170, Actinomyces spp. cluster I, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Lautropia mirabilis, Propionibacterium propionicum, Rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and Streptococcus sanguinis (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: As determined by HOMIM, patients with RP presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the GR and PH groups.
