TI  == are cellulosome scaffolding protein cipc and cbm3-containing protein hycp, involved in adherence of clostridium cellulolyticum to cellulose?
AB  == clostridium cellulolyticum, a mesophilic anaerobic bacterium, produces highly active enzymatic complexes called cellulosomes. this strain was already shown to  bind to cellulose, however the molecular mechanism(s) involved is not known. in this context we focused on the gene named hycp, encoding a 250-kda protein of unknown function, containing a family-3 carbohydrate binding module (cbm3) along  with 23 hyaline repeat modules (hyr modules). in the microbial kingdom the gene hycp is only found in c. cellulolyticum and the very close strain recently sequenced clostridium sp bnl1100. its presence in c. cellulolyticum guided us to  analyze its function and its putative role in adhesion of the cells to cellulose. the cbm3 of hycp was shown to bind to crystalline cellulose and was assigned to the cbm3b subfamily. no hydrolytic activity on cellulose was found with a mini-protein displaying representative domains of hycp. a c. cellulolyticum inactivated hycp mutant strain was constructed, and we found that hycp is neither involved in binding of the cells to cellulose nor that the protein has an obvious role in cell growth on cellulose. we also characterized the role of the cellulosome scaffolding protein cipc in adhesion of c. cellulolyticum to cellulose, since cellulosome scaffolding protein has been proposed to mediate binding of other cellulolytic bacteria to cellulose. a second mutant was constructed, where cipc was inactivated. we unexpectedly found that cipc is only  partly involved in binding of c. cellulolyticum to cellulose. other mechanisms for cellulose adhesion may therefore exist in c. cellulolyticum. in addition, no  cellulosomal protuberances were observed at the cellular surface of c. cellulolyticum, what is in contrast to reports from several other cellulosomes producing strains. these findings may suggest that c. cellulolyticum has no dedicated molecular mechanism to aggregate the cellulosomes at the cellular surface.
