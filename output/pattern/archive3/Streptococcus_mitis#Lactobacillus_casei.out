bacterial adhesion to silica sand as related to gibbs energy variations.
bacterial adhesion to silica sand was related to variations in system gibbs energy deltag(adh). two typical gram-positive bacterial strains of streptococcus mitis and lactobacillus casei were used as the model bacteria in this research. impacts of solution chemistry and goethite coating of silica sand on bacterial adhesion were also explored. s. mitis and l. casei had negative deltag(adh) with both uncoated and goethite-coated silica sand, demonstrating their adhesion potentials to these substrate. after goethite coating, deltag(adh) decreased (negatively increased) for both s. mitis and l. casei. in the presence of rhamnolipid biosurfactant, deltag(adh) increased (negatively decreased) in answer to the increase of the rhamnolipid biosurfactant concentration. bacterial percentage adhesion to silica sand corresponded to deltag(adh). this study demonstrated that bacterial adhesion to substrate could be explained in terms of bacterial, substratum and intervening medium physicochemical surface properties, which can be independently determined based on contact angle measurements.
identification and nucleotide sequence of genes involved in the synthesis of lactocin 705, a two-peptide bacteriocin from lactobacillus casei crl 705.
the structural gene determinants of lactocin 705, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus casei crl 705, have been amplified from a plasmid of approximately 35 kb and sequenced. lactocin 705 is a class iib bacteriocin, whose activity depends upon the complementation of two peptides (705alpha and 705beta) of 33 amino acid residues each. these peptides are synthesized as precursors with signal sequences of the double-glycine type, which exhibited high identities with the leader peptides of plantaricin s and j from lactobacillus plantarum, brochocin c from brochotrix campestris, sakacin p from lactobacillus sake, and the competence stimulating peptides from streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mitis. however, the two mature bacteriocins 705alpha and 705beta do not show significant similarity to other sequences in the databases.
