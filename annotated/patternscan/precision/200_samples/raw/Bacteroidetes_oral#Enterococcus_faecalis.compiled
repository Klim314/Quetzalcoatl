TI  - [Study of association between Parvimonas micra and pulp dominant pathogens in the infected root canals with chronic periradicular periodontitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of Parvimonas micra (Pm) and the associations  between Pm and pulp dominant pathogens in order to reflect the colonization of Pm in the infected root canals with chronic periradicular periodontitis. METHODS: A total of 120 teeth diagnosed as chronic periradicular periodontitis from 104 patients were included into the study. The teeth were allocated into untreated (primary infectious) and root-canal- treated (secondary infectious) groups with 60 in either group. Samples were collected from the root canals using sterile files and paper points, and subsequent extraction of bacterial DNA was undertaken. The Pm 16S rDNA level was evaluated using 16S rDNA PCR. The prevalence of Pm in chronic periradicular periodontitis was determined accordingly. Then, the associations of Pm and Enterococcus faecalis (Ef), Porphyromonas endodontalis (Pe) as well as Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) were analysed. RESULTS: Pm was detected in 40% (24/60) of the samples from the primary infectious group, 5% (3/60) from the secondary infectious group. The prevalences of Pm from the two groups were different significantly (chi(2) = 21.06, P < 0.05). Significant correlations (untreated group OR = 5.98, root-canal-treated group OR = 33.50) between Pm and Pe were identified in both groups, while the correlations between Pm and Pg as well as Ef were not of significance, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A significantly higher relevance ratio of Pm was estimated in the primary infectious group than the secondary infectious one. Pm and Pe were correlated significantly in the infected root canals, suggesting a symbiotic relation between these two bacteria.
TI  - Highly diverse microbiota in dental root canals in cases of apical periodontitis  (data of illumina sequencing).
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic apical periodontitis (CAP) is a frequent condition that has a considerable effect on a patient's quality of life. We aimed to reveal root canal microbial communities in antibiotic-naive patients by applying Illumina sequencing (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA). METHODS: Samples were collected under strict aseptic conditions from 12 teeth (5 with primary CAP, 3 with secondary CAP, and 4 with a periapical abscess [PA]) and characterized by profiling the microbial community on the basis of the V6 hypervariable region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene by using Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing combinatorial sequence-tagged polymerase chain reaction products. RESULTS: Root canal specimens displayed highly polymicrobial communities in all 3 patient groups. One sample contained 5-8 (mean = 6.5) phyla of bacteria. The most numerous were Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, but Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes, Tenericutes, and Synergistetes were also present in most of the patients. One sample contained 30-70 different operational taxonomic units; the mean (+/- standard deviation) was lower in the primary CAP group (36 +/- 4) than in the PA (45 +/- 4) and secondary CAP (43 +/- 13) groups (P < .05). The communities were individually different, but anaerobic bacteria predominated as the rule. Enterococcus faecalis was found only in patients with secondary CAP. One PA sample displayed a significantly high proportion (47%) of Proteobacteria, mainly at the expense of Janthinobacterium lividum. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided an in-depth characterization of the microbiota of periapical tissues, revealing highly polymicrobial communities and minor differences between the study groups. A full understanding of the etiology of periodontal disease will only be possible through further in-depth systems-level analyses of the host-microbiome interaction.
TI  - In vitro comparison of commercial oral rinses on bacterial adhesion and their detachment from biofilm formed on hydroxyapatite disks.
AB  - PURPOSE: This in vitro study was designed to assess the effectiveness of three oral rinses on bacterial adherence to epithelial cells and hydroxyapatite surfaces. The role of oral rinses on the detachment of bacteria from biofilm was also evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The efficacy of three oral rinses, Acclean, Noplak and Prevention were tested against a wide range of oral bacteria. Oral rinse antimicrobial activity was determined by an MTT assay for bacterial viability, by live/ dead staining and by measuring the bacterial metabolic activity using an XTT assay. RESULTS: The two oral rinses that contained 0.12% chlorhexidine had the greatest antibacterial activity on both planktonic and bio lm-grown organisms when compared to the Prevention oral rinse. CONCLUSION: Both Acclean and Noplak were extremely effective in lowering the number of bacteria attached to buccal epithelial cells and pelllicles. In addition, these two oral rinses were also effective against the biofilm bacteria.
TI  - Antibiogram pattern of oral microflora in periodontic children of age group 6 to  12 years: a clinicomicrobiological study.
AB  - AIM: The study was carried out to see the diversity of oral microflora and its antibiotic sensitivity test in children of age group 6 to 12 years was carried. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Total 50 patients of age group 6 to 12 years were analyzed for their oral microflora and then checked for the antibiotic susceptibility test. The samples that were collected were incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 hours. Once dispersed samples were taken and Gram staining was done, also they were spread on to a number of freshly prepared agar plates and incubated to allow cells to form microbial colony. RESULTS: The result showed microflora common in all types, Gram-positive facultative anaerobic rods and cocci. In normal children Gram-positive facultative anaerobic and fermenting cocci were predominant where as in children with caries growth of microbiota that were Gram-negative and positive, capnophilic, motile and anaerobic rods and cocci belonging to members of genera S. mutans and A. actinomycetemcomitans was seen. CONCLUSION: By the present study it has been concluded that the number of bacteria determined by microscopic counts was twice as high in caries patients as in healthy sites, and also recommended that amoxicillin, ampicillin and amikacin are the most effective antibacterial drugs for the treatment of dental caries.
TI  - Bioactive nanofibrous scaffolds for regenerative endodontics.
AB  - Here we report the synthesis, materials characterization, antimicrobial capacity, and cytocompatibility of novel antibiotic-containing scaffolds. Metronidazole (MET) or Ciprofloxacin/(CIP) was mixed with a polydioxanone (PDS)polymer solution at 5 and 25 wt% and processed into fibers. PDS fibers served as a control. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), tensile testing, and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were used to assess fiber morphology, chemical structure, mechanical properties, and drug release, respectively. Antimicrobial properties were evaluated against those of Porphyromonas gingivalis/Pg and Enterococcus faecalis/Ef. Cytotoxicity was assessed in human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs). Statistics were performed, and significance was set at the 5% level. SEM imaging revealed a submicron fiber diameter. FTIR confirmed antibiotic incorporation. The tensile values of hydrated 25 wt% CIP scaffold were significantly lower than those of all other groups. Analysis of HPLC data confirmed gradual, sustained drug release from the scaffolds over 48 hrs. CIP-containing scaffolds significantly (p < .00001) inhibited biofilm growth of both bacteria. Conversely, MET-containing scaffolds inhibited only Pg growth. Agar diffusion confirmed the antimicrobial properties against specific bacteria for the antibiotic-containing scaffolds. Only the 25 wt% CIP-containing scaffolds were cytotoxic. Collectively, this study suggests that polymer-based antibiotic-containing electrospun scaffolds could function as a biologically safe antimicrobial drug delivery system for regenerative endodontics.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in human chronic periodontitis microbiota.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic periodontitis (CP) may yield multiple species of putative periodontal bacterial pathogens that vary in their antibiotic drug susceptibility. This study determines the occurrence of in vitro antibiotic resistance among selected subgingival periodontal pathogens in patients with CP. METHODS: Subgingival biofilm specimens from inflamed deep periodontal pockets were removed before treatment from 400 adults with CP in the United States. The samples were cultured, and selected periodontal pathogens were tested in vitro for susceptibility to amoxicillin at 8 mg/L, clindamycin at 4 mg/L, doxycycline at 4 mg/L, and metronidazole at 16 mg/L, with a post hoc combination of data for amoxicillin and metronidazole. Gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads were subjected to ciprofloxacin disk-diffusion testing. RESULTS: Overall, 74.2% of the patients with CP revealed subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to at least one of the test antibiotics. One or more test species, most often Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, Streptococcus constellatus, or Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, were resistant in vitro to doxycycline, amoxicillin, metronidazole, or clindamycin, in 55%, 43.3%, 30.3%, and 26.5% of the patients with CP, respectively. Fifteen percent of patients harbored subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to both amoxicillin and metronidazole, which were mostly either S. constellatus (45 individuals) or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains of Gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads (nine individuals). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CP in the United States frequently yielded subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant in vitro to therapeutic concentrations of antibiotics commonly used in clinical periodontal practice. The wide variability found in periodontal pathogen antibiotic-resistance patterns should concern clinicians empirically selecting antibiotic treatment regimens for patients with CP.
TI  - Comprehensive analysis of secondary dental root canal infections: a combination of culture and culture-independent approaches reveals new insights.
AB  - Persistence of microorganisms or reinfections are the main reasons for failure of root canal therapy. Very few studies to date have included culture-independent methods to assess the microbiota, including non-cultivable microorganisms. The aim of this study was to combine culture methods with culture-independent cloning methods to analyze the microbial flora of root-filled teeth with periradicular lesions. Twenty-one samples from previously root-filled teeth were collected from patients with periradicular lesions. Microorganisms were cultivated, isolated and biochemically identified. In addition, ribosomal DNA of bacteria, fungi and archaea derived from the same samples was amplified and the PCR products were used to construct clone libraries. DNA of selected clones was sequenced and microbial species were identified, comparing the sequences with public databases. Microorganisms were found in 12 samples with culture-dependent and -independent methods combined. The number of bacterial species ranged from 1 to 12 in one sample. The majority of the 26 taxa belonged to the phylum Firmicutes (14 taxa), followed by Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. One sample was positive for fungi, and archaea could not be detected. The results obtained with both methods differed. The cloning technique detected several as-yet-uncultivated taxa. Using a combination of both methods 13 taxa were detected that had not been found in root-filled teeth so far. Enterococcus faecalis was only detected in two samples using culture methods. Combining the culture-dependent and -independent approaches revealed new candidate endodontic pathogens and a high diversity of the microbial flora in root-filled teeth with periradicular lesions. Both methods yielded differing results, emphasizing the benefit of combined methods for the detection of the actual microbial diversity in apical periodontitis.
TI  - Efficacy of berberine, an antimicrobial plant alkaloid, as an endodontic irrigant against a mixed-culture biofilm in an in vitro tooth model.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Berberine, a plant alkaloid isolated from many medicinal plants, has shown antimicrobial activity against selected oral pathogens. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of berberine solution against selected endodontic pathogens using a multispecies biofilm tooth model. METHODS: The bacterial species used in the multispecies biofilm tooth model were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Enterococcus faecalis, and Prevotella intermedia. Extracted human anterior teeth were collected and standardized to a length of 14.0 mm. Teeth were cultured in Schaedler broth with the 3 test bacteria strains for 21 days and then randomly assigned to 6 treatment groups (ie, sterile saline, 5.25% NaOCl, 2% chlorhexidine [CHX], 1% CHX, 2 mg/mL berberine, and 1 mg/mL berberine plus 1% CHX). The teeth were instrumented to size 35/.06 and irrigated with 6 mL irrigant for 2 minutes. Surviving bacteria were sampled before and after instrumentation. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance (P < .05) followed by the Scheffe test. RESULTS: The minimal inhibitory concentration of berberine against F. nucleatum, P. intermedia, and E. faecalis was 31.25 mug/mL, 3.8 mug/mL, and 500 mug/mL, respectively. Instrumentation and irrigation resulted in 99% bacterial reduction in all groups. All tested solutions resulted in a statistically significant reduction in bacteria when compared with the saline control. When used alone, berberine (2 mg/mL) was less effective than the other test irrigants. However, when combined with 1% CHX, berberine (2 mg/mL) was comparable in bactericidal activity with 5.25% NaOCl, 2% CHX, and 1% CHX (Table 2). CONCLUSIONS: Berberine was more effective than saline as an endodontic irrigant against selected endodontic pathogens in vitro and, when combined with CHX, was comparable with NaOCl in its bactericidal efficacy.
TI  - Bactericidal activity and oral pathogen inactivation by electromagnetic wave irradiation.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this work was to clarify the effects of electromagnetic wave irradiation (EMWI) on oral bacterial pathogens. METHODS AND RESULTS: A Gram-negative (Porphyromonas gingivalis) or Gram-positive (Streptococcus mutans, S. intermedius, Enterococcus faecalis) bacterial suspension was irradiated by EMW apparatus (500-1000 kHz, 5-15 times, 1 s time(-1) ). Quantification of survival bacteria by CFU counting revealed that EMWI exhibited marked bactericidal activity against all tested bacteria and bactericidal activity at 500 kHz increased in an irradiation number-dependent manner. After EMWI at 500 kHz, scanning electron microscopic observations showed that the chain of S. mutans cells was shortened after 5 irradiations and the outlines of bacterial cells (S. mutans and P. gingivalis) were unclear after 5-10 irradiations. EMWI inhibited the inductive effect of S. mutans on pro-inflammatory cytokine production in human monocytes and this inhibitory effect was comparable with that of heat-killed bacteria. Furthermore, using an enzyme activity assay, EMWI partially inactivated the activities of gingipains from P. gingivalis. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrated that EMWI has inactivation and bactericidal activities against single microbial species among four kinds of oral pathogens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Electromagnetic wave irradiation may be applicable for medical disinfection and sterilization, such as refractory periapical periodontitis.
TI  - Effect of a calcium hydroxide/chlorhexidine paste as intracanal dressing in human primary teeth with necrotic pulp against Porphyromonas gingivalis and Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intracanal medication is important for endodontic treatment success as it eliminates microorganisms that persist after biomechanical preparation. Aim. To evaluate the effect of two intracanal medications against Porphyromonas gingivalis and Enterococcus faecalis in the root canals of human primary teeth with necrotic pulp with and without furcal/periapical lesion, using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). DESIGN: Thirty-two teeth with necrotic pulp were used. Twelve teeth did not present lesion, and 20 teeth presented radiographically visible furca/periapical lesion. Microbiological samples were collected after coronal access and biomechanical preparation. The teeth were medicated with calcium hydroxide pastes prepared with either polyethylene glycol or chlorhexidine. After 30days, the medication was removed and a third collection was performed. Microbiological samples were processed using qRT-PCR. Data were analysed by Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney tests (alpha=0.05). RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the microbiota present in the primary teeth with and without furcal/periapical lesion. Biomechanical preparation was effective in reducing the number of microorganisms (P<0.05). The intracanal medications had similar antibacterial activity. CONCLUSION: The association of chlorhexidine with calcium hydroxide did not increase the antibacterial activity of the intracanal medication in the treatment of primary teeth with necrotic pulp with and without furcal/periapical lesion.
TI  - Association of red complex, A. actinomycetemcomitans and non-oral bacteria with periodontal diseases.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pathogens related to systemic infections have been detected in the periodontal microbiota. The relationship amongst these pathogens, periodontal bacteria and periodontal clinical status is poorly understood. This study evaluated the association amongst red complex, A. actinomycetemcomitans (A.a) and non-oral pathogenic bacteria in subjects with good periodontal health (PH), gingivitis (G), chronic (CP) and aggressive (AP) periodontitis. METHODS: Subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 51 PH, 42 G, 219 CP and 90 AP subjects. The presence and levels of A.a, red complex (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola), Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus were determined by DNA probes and DNA-DNA hybridization technique. RESULTS: CP and AP subjects presented significantly higher prevalence and levels of A.a, red complex and A. baumannii than G and PH individuals (p<0.01), whereas S. aureus was detected in lower frequency and counts in AP as compared to the other groups (p<0.001). The predictor variables age, prevalence of red complex, and the presence of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa were strongly associated with the frequency of sites with PD and CAL >/=5 mm. Increasing age (OR 1.08), high frequency of red complex (OR 6.10), and the presence of A.a with P. aeruginosa (OR 1.90) were associated with periodontal disease (p<0.001). Subjects harbouring a high prevalence of A.a, A. baumannii, and red complex with P. aeruginosa were more likely to have AP than CP (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Putative periodontal pathogens and non-oral bacteria alone or in association were strongly associated with periodontitis.
TI  - Development of novel oral formulations prepared via hot melt extrusion for targeted delivery of photosensitizer to the colon.
AB  - Colon-residing bacteria, such as vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Bacteroides fragilis, can cause a range of serious clinical infections. Photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy (PACT) may be a novel treatment option for these multidrug resistant organisms. The aim of this study was to formulate a Eudragit(R)-based drug delivery system, via hot melt extrusion (HME), for targeting colonic release of photosensitizer. The susceptibility of E. faecalis and B. fragilis to PACT mediated by methylene blue (MB), meso-tetra(N-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphine tetra-tosylate (TMP), or 5-aminolevulinic acid hexyl-ester (h-ALA) was determined, with tetrachlorodecaoxide (TCDO), an oxygen-releasing compound, added in some studies. Results show that, for MB, an average of 30% of the total drug load was released over a 6-h period. For TMP and h-ALA, these values were 50% and 16% respectively. No drug was released in the acidic media. Levels of E. faecalis and B. fragilis were reduced by up to 4.67 and 7.73 logs, respectively, on PACT exposure under anaerobic conditions, with increased kill associated with TCDO. With these formulations, photosensitizer release could potentially be targeted to the colon, and colon-residing pathogens killed by PACT. TCDO could be used in vivo to generate oxygen, which could significantly impact on the success of PACT in the clinic.
TI  - An in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (CloSYS Oral Rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. METHODS: Oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. The numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity. RESULTS: As expected, Listerine and Crest Pro-Health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. Breath Rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. CloSYS and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, CloSYS oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that CloSYS Oral Rinse has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.
TI  - Effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic species--an in vitro study.
AB  - The in vitro study was aimed to determine the effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic microorganisms. Ozone was generated for 6 s-2 x 24 s (corresponding to 0.56 mg-2 x 2.24 mg of ozone) against 23 mainly anaerobic periodontopathogenic species. Agar diffusion test was used as a screening method. Then, the killing activity was tested in a serum-free environment and with 25% v/v inactivated serum. Further, the effect of ozone on bactericidal activity of native serum was analyzed against Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. Agar diffusion test showed a high efficacy of ozone against microorganisms, especially against Porphyromonas gingivalis. This result was confirmed by the killing tests; most of the strains in a concentration of 10(5) were completely eliminated after twofold 18-s application of ozone. Only four of the six potentially "superinfecting" species (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Candida albicans) survived in part. Addition of heat-inactivated serum reduced the killing rate of ozone by 78% after 6-s and by 47% after twofold 18-s exposures; no strain was completely eradicated after any application of ozone. The bactericidal effect of native serum was enhanced after application of ozone; no effect was visible on the included A. actinomycetemcomitans strain which was found to be completely resistant to the bactericidal action of serum. In conclusion, (a) ozone has a strong antibacterial activity against putative periodontopathogenic microorganisms, and (b) the bactericidal effect is reduced in the presence of serum. Ozone may have potential as an adjunctive application to mechanical treatment in periodontitis patients.
TI  - Persistence of dead-cell bacterial DNA in ex vivo root canals and influence of nucleases on DNA decay in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The fate of DNA from bacteria that do not survive in the root canal is uncertain, yet DNA longevity may confound recovery of authentic etiologic participants in the disease process. This study assessed the recovery of PCR-detectable DNA in ex vivo human root canals and some environmental factors on the decay of microbial DNA. STUDY DESIGN: Heat-killed Enterococcus faecalis cells were inoculated into instrumented human root canals ex vivo, and samples were taken at intervals over 2 years and analyzed by polymerase chain reaction. In an in vitro assay, heat-killed E. faecalis cells and extracted E. faecalis DNA were inoculated into various media, DNase, and culture of a DNase-producing species, Prevotella intermedia. Recovery of DNA was assessed by gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: In ex vivo human teeth, amplifiable DNA was recovered after 1 and 2 years (in 14/15 and 21/25 teeth, respectively). In vitro experiments showed that extracted DNA incubated in different media (water, 10%-50% sera, and DNase) progressively decomposed to levels below the detection limit. In corresponding assays, cell-bound DNA was more resistant to decay. CONCLUSION: Amplifiable DNA is preserved after cell death, but the critical determinant is the form of DNA. Free DNA undergoes spontaneous and enzymatic decomposition, whereas cell-bound E. faecalis DNA persists for long periods.
TI  - Detection of selected bacterial species in intraoral sites of patients with chronic periodontitis using multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to detect the prevalence of selected bacterial species in intraoral sites of patients with chronic periodontitis (CP) using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). METHODOLOGY: Samples were collected from the tongue dorsum, buccal mucosa, supragingival and subgingival plaque and saliva of 30 patients with untreated CP. Multiplex PCR was used to determine prevalence rates, which were then compared using a chi-square test. Significance level was set at p<0.05. Mean and standard deviation values were used to evaluate variations in prevalence according to site. RESULTS: The prevalence of S. mutans was 70% in saliva; 60% in samples collected from the tongue dorsum; 50% in samples collected from the buccal mucosa; 56.5% in the supragingival plaque; and 53.5% in the subgingival plaque. The prevalence of E. faecalis ranged from 3.5% to 13.5% in all intraoral microenvironment. The highest prevalence of P. gingivalis was found in subgingival plaque (53.5%), and of P. intermedia in supragingival plaque (33.5%), subgingival plaque (30%) and tongue dorsum (33.5%). The prevalence of bacteria did not vary significantly among the intraoral sites. CONCLUSIONS: All studied bacteria were identified in intraoral sites. S. mutans, P. gingivalis and P. intermedia had high prevalence rates, but the prevalence of E. faecalis was low. Multiplex PCR proved to be an adequate method for epidemiological studies.
TI  - Study of the direct bactericidal effect of Nd:YAG and diode laser parameters used in endodontics on pigmented and nonpigmented bacteria.
AB  - Laser light can be used during endodontic procedures to sterilize the root canal  by destroying bacteria. Previous in-vitro studies that investigated the mechanism of the destruction of bacteria inhabiting the root canal by 1,064-nm Nd:YAG and 808-nm diode laser light used substrates that absorb light in the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum. These substrates heat the bacterial microenvironment, which possibly contributes to cell death. To determine the direct effect of laser light on the bacterial sample in the absence of detrimental heating, a sapphire substrate, which is virtually transparent in NIR spectrum, was inoculated with bacterial samples and subjected to laser irradiation at 1,064 nm (1.5 W, 15 Hz) and at 808 nm (1.5 W, 20 Hz). Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Porphyromonas gingivalis bacteria were used. E. faecalis and E. coli were largely unaffected by laser light. The viability of P. gingivalis, a pigmented bacterium, was directly affected by both NIR wavelengths (a 57% decrease of viability at 1,064 nm and a 31% decrease at 808 nm). Our results indicate that the primary mediator of cell death appears to be the interaction between NIR laser light and the bacterial microenvironment, most likely in the form of heating. Our research suggests that when optimizing the efficacy of laser-assisted endodontic sterilization of the root canal, the optical characteristics of the bacterial microenvironment play a key role, as nonpigmented bacteria appear to be virtually transparent at 808 nm and 1,064 nm.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of MTAD, Tetraclean, Cloreximid, and sodium hypochlorite on  three common endodontic pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the antimicrobial action of BioPure MTAD (Dentsply Tulsa Dental, Johnson City, TN), Tetraclean, Cloreximid (a mixture of Chlorhexidine (CHX) digluconate and Cetrimide), and 5.25% NaOCl (Ogna Laboratori Farmaceutici, Milano, Italy) against selected endodontic pathogens (Enterococcus faecalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The agar plate diffusion procedure was used to observe the antimibrobial activity of irrigants. RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed significant effects of the different irrigants on the bacteria colonies. Treatment with 5.25% NaOCl induced a larger zone of microbial inhibition in Prevotella intermedia and Porphyromonas gingivalis (Tukey HSD post-test, P = 0.0001) when compare to MTAD, Tetraclean and CHX. Anyway, MTAD and Tetraclean were more effective to inhibit bacterial growth compared to CHX (P < 0.0001, Tukey HSD post-test). Furthermore, post hoc analysis revealed that MTAD and Tetraclean induced the largest zone of microbial inhibition of Enterococcus faecalis cultured under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, when compared with 2% CHX and NaOCl (P < 0.0001, Tukey HSD post-test). The control group showed no microbial inhibition. CONCLUSION: 5.25% NaOCl showed a high antimicrobial activity against anaerobic bacteria. MTAD and Tetraclean showed a high action against both, strictly anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria. Chlorexidine + Cetrimide (Cloreximid) showed the lowest antibacterial activity against both, facultative and strictly anaerobic bacteria tested.
TI  - Antimicrobial action of intracanal medicaments on the external root surface.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess in vitro the antimicrobial action of intracanal medicaments in the external root surface, with or without of cementum. METHODS: After the placement of intracanal medicaments, the coronal and apical openings were sealed. The antimicrobial action of 2% chlorhexidine gel (2%CHX); calcium hydroxide+2% chlorhexidine gel (CH+2%CHX); calcium hydroxide+2% chlorhexidine gel+zinc oxide (CH+2%CHX+ZnO); calcium hydroxide+saline solution (CH+SS) was evaluated against Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Actinomyces viscosus and Porphyromonas gingivalis. The samples were placed over the agar, and the zones of inhibition of microbial growth were measured after the incubation period. RESULTS: The antimicrobial effects of the medicaments could be ranked from strongest to weakest as follows: 2%CHX, CH+2%CHX, CH+2%CHX+ZnO, CH+SS. No differences among groups were verified in the presence or absence of cementum. CONCLUSIONS: 2%CHX containing medicaments diffused into the dentin and reached the outer surface, exerting antimicrobial action.
TI  - Comparative analysis of endodontic pathogens using checkerboard hybridization in  relation to culture.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: The purpose of this study was to detect bacterial species and to  quantify the total number of bacteria from samples of infected root canals before (S1) and after chemo-mechanical preparation using 2% chlorhexidine (CHX) gel as auxiliary chemical substance (S2) and after 7 days of intracanal dressing (S3) to compare microbial changes. METHOD: Twenty-four teeth were selected for this study. Chemo-mechanical preparation was performed using 2% CHX gel, then three different intracanal medicaments [M1: Ca(OH)(2) paste; M2: 2% CHX gel; and M3: Ca(OH)(2) paste plus 2% CHX gel] were used for 7 days. Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization was performed to detect 40 bacterial species. Aerobic and anaerobic culture techniques were used to determine the bacterial community by counting the colony-forming units (CFU). RESULTS: The species most frequently identified by checkerboard in S1 were: Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, Treponema socranskii ssp. socranskii, Parvimonas micra and Enterococcus faecalis. In S2 and S3 a total of eight different species were identified; and only one of them was gram-positive (E. faecalis). Microorganisms were not identified after use of M2 for 7 days. The quantification obtained on agar plates ranged from 4 x 10(5) to 2.6 x 10(6) CFU/ml in S1, mean CFU was reduced by 99.96% in S2, and there was no statistical difference between the CFU in S2 and S3. CONCLUSION: The antibacterial effect of the mechanical preparation supplemented by the use of an antibacterial auxiliary substance greatly reduced the microorganisms in the main root canal.
TI  - Molecular analysis of the root canal microbiota associated with endodontic treatment failures.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The failure of endodontic treatment is usually caused by persistent/secondary intraradicular infections and Enterococcus faecalis has been considered to be the main pathogen involved. Nevertheless, the breadth of bacterial diversity involved with endodontic treatment failures remains to be consistently explored by culture-independent approaches. METHODS: This study determined the intraradicular microbiota of root-canal-treated teeth with post-treatment apical periodontitis using 16S ribosomal RNA gene clone library analysis. RESULTS: Bacteria were present in all cases, confirming the infectious etiology of post-treatment disease. Seventy-four bacterial taxa belonging to six phyla were found in the nine cases investigated. Of these, 55% were identified as as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes, which also made up a significant proportion of the microbiota in many cases. Twenty-five new phylotypes were identified. Most teeth harbored a mixed consortium, with a mean number of 10 taxa per case. Only 11 taxa were found in more than one case, revealing a high interindividual variability in the composition of the microbiota. CONCLUSION: The current findings revealed new candidate endodontic pathogens, including as-yet-uncultivated bacteria and taxa other than E. faecalis, which may participate in the mixed infections associated with post-treatment apical periodontitis.
TI  - PCR-based identification of selected pathogens associated with endodontic infections in deciduous and permanent teeth.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of the selected pathogens in samples from deciduous and permanent tooth root canals by using PCR method and to determine the association of these organisms with clinical symptoms. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 145 children, 5 to 13 years old, were involved in this study. The presence of selected pathogens (Actinomyces israelii, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Streptococcus intermedius, Treponema denticola, Parvimonas micra, Tannerella forsythensis, Enterococcus faecium, Prevotella melaninogenica) in infected root canals was studied using PCR. RESULTS: T. denticola (P = .012, .02) and E. faecalis (P = .012, .04) were highly associated with periapical radiolucency and previous pain, while P. gingivalis was associated with tenderness to percussion in both deciduous and permanent teeth (P = .01, .015). CONCLUSION: The results of the present study confirm that certain species of microorganisms are associated with clinical signs and symptoms of endodontic disease in both deciduous and permanent teeth.
TI  - Microbiological evaluation of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without sinus tract.
AB  - AIM: To examine the microbiological status of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without a sinus tract. METHODOLOGY: Samples were collected by means of a size 15 H-type file and two sterile paper points from 30 cases of primary endodontic infections with (n = 15) or without (n = 15) a sinus tract. The presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. RESULTS: The species found at the highest levels and prevalence were Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. vincentii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Enterococcus faecalis, Campylobacter gracilis and Neisseria mucosa. Total bacterial counts were similar between teeth with (44 x 10(5)) and without (50 x 10(5)) a sinus tract (t-test: P > 0.05). E. faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus, Capnocytophaga sputigena and Capnocytophaga gingivalis had significantly higher counts in the absence of sinus tract (Mann-Whitney test, P < 0.05). Higher levels of P. gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum were observed in cases with a sinus tract. Leptotrichia buccalis (OR = 1.83; CI 95%) and Porphyromonas endodontalis (OR = 2.15; CI 95%) were associated with an increased chance of subjects having a sinus tract. CONCLUSIONS: Primary endodontic infections were associated with a large variety of bacterial species. Specific differences between the composition of the microbiota of primary root canal infections were observed in cases with or without a sinus tract.
TI  - Determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration of four medicaments used as intracanal medication.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of iodoform, calcium hydroxide, IKI (iodine potassium iodine) and CFC (ciprofloxacin, Flagyl (metronidazole) and calcium hydroxide) required to kill S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and B. fragilis. In the experiment, medicaments were added to bacterial species into test tubes, in 10 different concentrations. The MIC was the lowest concentration of the drug at which bacterial growth could not be observed. In this investigation, CFC was the most effective medicament against all bacteria. All drugs were able to eliminate E. faecalis and B. fragilis, while IKI was not effective against S. aureus. IKI and calcium hydroxide were not able to eliminate P. aeruginosa as well.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of propolis and other substances against selected endodontic pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial effect of ethanol extract of propolis (EEP) and intracanal medicaments calcium hydroxide, camphorated paramonochlorophenol, and formocresol by means of the macrodilution method using the reinforced clostridial medium (RCM) and brucella and brain heart infusion media. STUDY DESIGN: The antimicrobial agents were sequentially diluted and tested against anaerobic bacteria Prevotella nigrescens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces israelii, and Clostridium perfringens and against Enterococcus faecalis, with the 5 x 10(5) CFU/mL standardized inocula. The tubes were anaerobically incubated and the minimum inhibitory concentration was detected. Blood agar RCM subcultures were performed to provide minimum bactericidal concentration. The results were analyzed by analysis of variance test. RESULTS: All drugs were effective against all tested strains, without statistical differences. E. faecalis was the less susceptible strain, and RCM broth promoted faster bacterial growth, but there were no significant differences in these results. Ethanol did not influence the antimicrobial effect of EEP.
TI  - Bacterial examination of endodontic infections by clonal analysis in concert with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to examine the diversity of bacterial  species in the infected root canals of teeth associated with endodontic abscesses by cloning and sequencing techniques in concert with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. METHODS: Samples collected from five infected root canals were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with universal 16S ribosomal DNA primers. Products of these PCRs were cloned and sequenced. Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) was used as a screening method to reduce the number of clones necessary for DNA sequencing. RESULTS: All samples were positive for the presence of bacteria and a range of 7-13 different bacteria were found per root canal sample. In total, 48 different oral clones were detected among the five root canal samples. Olsenella profusa was the only species present in all samples. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Dialister pneumosintes, Dialister invisus, Lachnospiraceae oral clone, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Peptostreptococcus micros and Enterococcus faecalis were found in two of the five samples. The majority of the taxa were present in only one sample, for example Tannerella forsythia, Shuttleworthia satelles and Filifactor alocis. Some facultative anaerobes that are frequently isolated from endodontic infections such as E. faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus and Lactobacillus spp. were also found in this study. CONCLUSION: Clonal analysis of the microflora associated with endodontic infections revealed a wide diversity of oral species.
TI  - Evaluation of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections using checkerboard  DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in 111 selected cases of single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. METHODS: Samples were collected from the root canals using #15 Hedstroen-type files and two sterile paper points, which were introduced 1 mm short of the apical foramen. The presence, levels, and proportions of 40 different bacterial species in each sample were determined using DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization techniques. RESULTS: The mean number of species per sample was 22. Enterococcus faecalis (89.3%), Campylobacter gracilis (89.3%), Leptotrichia buccalis (89.3%), Neisseria mucosa (87.5%), Prevotella melaninogenica (86.6%), Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii (85.7%), Eubacterium saburreum (75.9%), Streptococcus anginosus (75%), and Veillonella parvula (74.1%) were the most prevalent species. The species found in highest mean counts (over 10(5)) were F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii (13.14 x 10(5)), E. saburreum (5.67 x 10(5)), E. faecalis (5.38 x 10(5)), N. mucosa (4.19 x 10(5)), V. parvula (3.63 x 10(5)), C. gracilis (3.46 x 10(5)), Treponema socranskii (3.34 x 10(5)), Porphyromonas endodontalis (2.96 x 10(5)), Porphyromonas gingivalis (2.85 x 10(5)), Micromonas micros (2.81 x 10(5)), Prevotella nigrescens (2.68 x 10(5)) and Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum (2.64 x 10(5)). Most of these species were also found in high proportions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that several bacterial species considered to be oral pathogens seem to be implicated in the etiology of primary endodontic infections.
TI  - Duration-dependent susceptibility of endodontic pathogens to calcium hydroxide and chlorhexidene gel used as intracanal medicament: an in vitro evaluation.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effective duration of antimicrobial activity of a calcium hydroxide-based medicament (Apex Cal) and 2% chlorhexidene gluconate gel against selected endodontic pathogens (Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia). The agar diffusion test was used to determine the antimicrobial activity. Chlorhexidene gluconate gel showed the largest inhibitory zones. The antimicrobial action of both medicaments decreased significantly with time, with calcium hydroxide showing no antimicrobial action after 72 hours. In conclusion, 2% chlorhexidene gel showed better antimicrobial activity than calcium hydroxide, and the effective antimicrobial action of both medicaments decreased after 48 hours.
TI  - Sensitivity of oral bacteria to 254 nm ultraviolet light.
AB  - AIM: To explore the sensitivity of bacteria commonly found in root canals to 254  nm ultraviolet (UV) light, either as individual cells or as participants of a bacterial multilayer. METHODOLOGY: The sensitivity of oral bacteria, as individual cells, to UV light was tested by subjecting plates streaked with bacteria to 254 nm UV, at a fluence of 1-20 mJ cm(-2). An experimental model was designed to produce a bacterial multilayer and to study absorption of UV light by bacteria in an outer layer and its effect on the elimination of bacteria in the inner layer. RESULTS: Direct exposure to relatively low doses of UV light (2-7 mJ cm(-2)) effectively eliminated all bacterial strains tested. Furthermore, an Enterococcus faecalis strain, partially resistant to a 24 h exposure to calcium hydroxide, was effectively eliminated within several seconds of exposure to UV light (P < 0.001). UV was absorbed by a multilayer of bacteria. When 4 bacterial cells microm(-2) were present in the light path, the UV light dose had to be increased by a factor of x10 to achieve 100% elimination of the bacteria in an inner layer. CONCLUSIONS: The application of UV light to eliminate endodontic pathogens may be possible. Nevertheless, its absorbance by outer layers of bacteria should be considered and the UV light dose adapted accordingly.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide combined with chlorhexidine gel used as intracanal medicament.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) combined with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) gel against endodontic pathogens and to compare the results with the ones achieved by Ca(OH)2 mixed with sterile water and by CHX gel alone. Two methods were used: the agar diffusion test and the direct contact test. Ca(OH)2 + 2% CHX gel produced inhibitory zones ranging from 2.84 to 6.5 mm, and required from 30 seconds to 6 hours to eliminate all tested microorganisms. However, 2% CHX gel showed the largest microbial growth zones from 4.33 to 21.67 mm, and required 1 minute or less to inhibit all tested microorganisms. A paste of Ca(OH)2 plus sterile water inhibited only the microorganisms with which it was in direct contact and required from 30 seconds to 24 hours to kill all tested microorganisms. In conclusion, 2% CHX gel + Ca(OH)2 showed better antimicrobial activity than Ca(OH)2 manipulated with sterile water.
TI  - Photodynamic therapy for endodontic disinfection.
AB  - The aims of this study were to investigate the effects of photodynamic therapy (PDT) on endodontic pathogens in planktonic phase as well as on Enterococcus faecalis biofilms in experimentally infected root canals of extracted teeth. Strains of microorganisms were sensitized with methylene blue (25 microg/ml) for 5 minutes followed by exposure to red light of 665 nm with an energy fluence of 30 J/cm2. Methylene blue fully eliminated all bacterial species with the exception of E. faecalis (53% killing). The same concentration of methylene blue in combination with red light (222 J/cm2) was able to eliminate 97% of E. faecalis biofilm bacteria in root canals using an optical fiber with multiple cylindrical diffusers that uniformly distributed light at 360 degrees. We conclude that PDT may be developed as an adjunctive procedure to kill residual bacteria in the root canal system after standard endodontic treatment.
TI  - Coaggregation interactions between oral and endodontic Enterococcus faecalis and  bacterial species isolated from persistent apical periodontitis.
AB  - Interactions between Enterococcus faecalis and other species found in root canal  infections might be important for the development and persistence of periapical disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the coaggregation interactions between E. faecalis clinical isolates and species previously shown to survive and induce apical periodontitis in monkeys: Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella oralis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Streptococcus anginosus. Intergeneric coaggregation assays were conducted in duplicate with observations scored immediately at 0 h, 1 h and 24 h after mixing of combinations of strains. All E. faecalis strains (n = 53) coaggregated with F. nucleatum; E. faecalis did not coaggregate with P. anaerobius or S. anginosus. One strain, E. faecalis E1, coaggregated with P. oralis, with aggregates visible at 1 h. Coaggregation interactions between E. faecalis and F. nucleatum observed in this study suggest a potential role for this combination in endodontic infections.
TI  - Influence of residual bacteria on periapical tissue healing after chemomechanical treatment and root filling of experimentally infected monkey teeth.
AB  - The purpose of this study was twofold: first, to determine the influence on the healing of the periapical tissues when selected bacterial strains and combinations thereof remain after root canal treatment; and, second, the relationship to healing of the quality of the root filling. In eight monkeys, 175 root canals, previously infected with combinations of four or five bacterial strains and with radiographically verified apical periodontitis, were endodontically treated, bacteriologically controlled, and permanently obturated. After 2-2.5 yr, the periapical regions were radiographically and histologically examined. Of these teeth, 48 root canals were also examined for bacteria remaining after removal of the root fillings. When bacteria remained after the endodontic treatment, 79% of the root canals showed non-healed periapical lesions, compared with 28% where no bacteria were found. Combinations of residual bacterial species were more frequently related to non-healed lesions than were single strains. When no bacteria remained, healing occurred independently of the quality of the root filling. In contrast, when bacteria remained, there was a greater correlation with non-healing in poor-quality root fillings than in technically well-performed fillings. In root canals where bacteria were found after removal of the root filling, 97% had not healed, compared with 18% for those root canals with no bacteria detected. The present study demonstrates the importance of obtaining a bacteria-free root canal system before permanent root filling in order to achieve optimal healing conditions for the periapical tissues.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial efficacy of a new chlorhexidine slow-release device.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial effect of chlorhexidine and calcium hydroxide slow-release devices on oral bacteria. METHOD AND MATERIALS: The agar diffusion test was used to evaluate the antibacterial effect of the slow-release devices Activ Point (chlorhexidine; Roeko) and Calcium Hydroxide Plus Point (Roeko) on 8 anaerobic and 2 facultative oral bacterial strains, as well as 2 bacterial cultures randomly sampled from necrotic root canals and incubated in anaerobic and aerobic broth for 48 hours. The efficiency of the medicaments against the various strains was evaluated using a nonparametric test (Friedman type) and a second nonparametric test (Wilcoxon's signed rank test). RESULTS: Activ Point produced significantly larger inhibition zones (P < .001) than the calcium hydroxide slow-release device around all tested bacterial strains. CONCLUSION: The chlorhexidine slow-release device (Activ Point) exhibited significant antibacterial activity in the agar diffusion test and merits study as an intracanal medicament.
TI  - Detection of bacteria in endodontic samples by polymerase chain reaction assays and association with defined clinical signs in Italian patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The presence of selected bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythensis, Treponema denticola) in infected root canals was studied using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, and the association of bacteria with clinical signs of endodontic disease was assessed. The null hypothesis, that no difference could be observed between clinical signs of apical periodontitis and a specific bacterial strain, was tested. METHODS: Microbial samples were obtained from 62 teeth in 54 patients with endodontic disease. For each tooth, clinical data including patient symptoms were collected. Teeth were categorized by diagnosis as having acute apical periodontitis (AAP, teeth with clinical symptoms but no periapical radiolucency, n=22), chronic apical periodontitis (CAP, teeth with radiolucency but no clinical symptoms, n=15) or exacerbated apical periodontitis (EAP, teeth with symptoms and radiolucency, n=25). Seventy-one percent of cases were primary endodontic infections, and 29% were recurrent ('secondary') endodontic infections (failing cases). PCR assays were used to detect the presence of the selected bacteria. RESULTS: T. denticola and E. faecalis were each detected in 15 of 62 samples (24%), P. gingivalis in 8 samples (13%), P. intermedia in 5 samples (8%), and T. forsythensis in 4 samples (7%). T. denticola was detected in 56% of teeth with EAP. E. faecalis was found in 60% of teeth with CAP and in 72% of teeth with secondary infection. Statistical analysis demonstrated an association of CAP and secondary endodontic infection with the presence of E. faecalis. (P<0.01). EAP was associated with the presence of T. denticola (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: T. denticola was associated with symptomatic endodontic disease in the presence of apical bone resorption. E. faecalis was associated with treatment failures. We suggest that these species may play critical roles in endodontic pathology.
TI  - Single species biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates on gutta-percha points.
AB  - The participation of bacterial biofilms in the over-filled gutta-percha points associated with refractory periapical periodontitis has recently been reported. This study investigated the initial biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates (Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Strep. intermedius, Strep. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Propionibacterium acnes, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia) on gutta-percha points in vitro. Each bacterial strain was suspended in 100% cell culture medium or in culture medium containing 4.5, 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. The bacterial suspensions were then co-incubated anaerobically with gutta-percha points for 7 d. The gutta-percha points were processed for scanning electron microscopic observation and examined for biofilm presence and thickness. E. faecalis, Strep. sanguis, Strep. intermedius, Strep. pyogenes and Staph. aureus biofilms were generated on the surfaces of the specimens incubated in culture medium supplemented with 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. The E. faecalis and Strep. sanguis biofilms were significantly thicker than those of Strep. intermedius, Strep. pyogenes and Staph. aureus. No biofilms were detected on the specimens incubated with F. nucleatum, Prop. acnes, Porph. gingivalis and Prev. intermedia. These findings suggest that Gram-positive facultative anaerobes have the ability to colonize and form extracellular matrices on gutta-percha points, while serum plays a crucial role in biofilm formation.
TI  - Polymerase chain reaction identification of microorganisms in previously root-filled teeth in a South Korean population.
AB  - A large body of evidence indicates that microorganisms are the primary causative  agents of endodontic treatment failures. This study intended to assess the occurrence of nine putative endodontic pathogens in root-filled teeth associated with periradicular lesions in a South Korean population using a culture-independent molecular approach. Fourteen root-filled teeth with persistent periradicular diseases were selected for retreatment. After removal of the root canal filling, the canals were sampled, and a polymerase chain reaction assay using taxon-specific oligonucleotide primers was used for microbial detection. Bacteria were present in all cases, as revealed by amplification using ubiquitous 16S rDNA primers. The most frequently detected taxon was Enterococcus faecalis (64%), followed by Streptococcus spp. (21%) and Tannerella forsythensis (14%). The results of this study using a highly sensitive identification method are concurrent with those from other geographical locations using diverse identification methods in that E. faecalis is the main species found in cases of root-filled teeth associated with periradicular lesions.
TI  - Apical periodontitis development and bacterial response to endodontic treatment.  Experimental root canal infections in monkeys with selected bacterial strains.
AB  - In six monkeys, 160 root canals were inoculated with a combination of four bacterial strains belonging to species Streptococcus milleri, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella oralis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. In two other monkeys, 24 root canals were inoculated with a five-strain combination consisting of these strains and a strain of Enterococcus faecalis. All strains were previously isolated from an infected monkey root canal. After 8-12 months, survival of the strains was recorded bacteriologically, and the reaction in the periapical region was radiographed. From 180 of 184 root canals, one or more of the bacterial strains were reisolated. The two facultative strains were more frequently reisolated than the anaerobic strains. Apical periodontitis was registered in the periapical region of more than 96% of root canals with reisolated bacteria but in none of those without reisolated bacteria. Endodontic treatment was carried out in two sessions with an interval of 14 d without interappointment dressings, and the effect was evaluated bacteriologically before and after each treatment. The chemo-mechanical treatment reduced significantly the number of strains and bacterial cells. The facultative bacteria were more resistant to the treatment than the anaerobic bacteria. The five-strain combination had a higher survival rate than the four-strain combination.
TI  - Association of T CD4 lymphocyte levels and subgingival microbiota of chronic periodontitis in HIV-infected Brazilians under HAART.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the subgingival microbiota of HIV-infected patients with chronic periodontitis and different T CD4 lymphocyte levels under HAART. STUDY DESIGN: 64 HIV+ patients (mean age 34.5 +/- 7.3; 75% males) were distributed into Group I: chronic periodontitis (> or = 3 sites with probing pocket depth (PPD) and/or clinical attachment level (CAL) > or = 5 mm); and Group II: periodontal health (no sites with PPD > 3 mm and/or CAL > 4 mm). All subjects received conventional periodontal therapy. Periodontal clinical parameters were evaluated at 6 sites/tooth in all teeth at baseline and 4 months after therapy. The levels of T CD4 were obtained from the patient's medical record. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the 6 sites with the largest pocket depth in each subject of Group I, and 6 randomly selected sites in subjects of Group II. The presence of 22 subgingival species was determined using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. Significant microbiological differences within and among groups were sought using Wilcoxon signed-rank and Mann-Whitney tests, respectively. Relationships between T CD4 levels and microbiological parameters were determined using Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: Sixty-one percent of the HIV-infected patients represented AIDS cases, although 69% of them were periodontally healthy. The T CD4 lymphocyte mean level was 333 cells/mm3 and viral load was 12,815 +/- 24,607 copies/mm3. Yet, the prevalence of chronic periodontitis was relatively low (36%). Several periodontal pathogens, in particular T. forsythensis (P < .05), were more prevalent in HIV-positive patients with periodontitis than in HIV-positive subjects with periodontal health. Most of the species decreased in frequency after therapy, particularly P. gingivalis (P < .05). E. faecalis and F. nucleatum were significantly more prevalent in the subgingival microbiota of patients with chronic periodontitis and lower levels of T CD4 (P < .05), while beneficial species tended to be more frequently detected in individuals with T CD4 counts over 500 cells/mm3. CONCLUSION: The subgingival microbiota of HIV-infected patients with chronic periodontitis include a high prevalence of classical periodontal pathogens observed in non-infected individuals. Furthermore, the severe immunosuppression seems to favor the colonization by these species, as well as by species not commonly found in the subgingival microbiota.
TI  - Microbiological examination of infected dental root canals.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the root canal microbiota of primary and secondary root-infected canals and the association of constituent species with specific endodontic signs and symptoms. METHODS: Microbial samples were taken from 60 root canals, 41 with necrotic pulp tissues (primary infection) and 19 with failed endodontic treatment (secondary infection). Strict anaerobic techniques were used for serial dilution, plating, incubation and identification. RESULTS: A total of 224 cultivable isolates were recovered belonging to 56 different bacterial species. Individual root canals yielded a maximum of 10 bacterial species. Of the bacterial isolates, 70% were either strict anaerobes or microphilic. The anaerobes most frequently isolated were: Peptostreptococcus micros (35%), Fusobacterium necrophorum (23.3%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (11.7%), Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (16.7%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%) and Porphyromonas endodontalis (5%). The root canal microflora of untreated teeth with apical periodontitis was found to be mixed, comprising gram-negative and gram-positive and mostly anaerobic microorganisms and usually containing more than 3 species per canal. On the other hand, facultative anaerobic and gram-positive bacteria predominated in canals with failed endodontic treatment, which harbored 1-2 species per canal. Suggested relationships were found between anaerobes, especially gram-negatives, and the presence or history of pain, tenderness to percussion and swelling (P<0.05). In particular, associations were found between: a) pain (n=29) and P. micros (P<0.01), P. intermedia/nigrescens and Eubacterium spp. (both P<0.05); b) history of pain (n=31) and P. micros (P<0.01) Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium spp. (P<0.05); c) tenderness to percussion (n=29) and Porphyromonas spp. (P<0.01), Peptostreptococcus and Fusobacterium spp. (P<0.001); d) swelling (n=20) and Peptostreptococcus spp. (P<0.01), Porphyromonas and Enterococcus spp. (P<0.05); e) wet canals (n=33) and Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium spp. (P<0.05); f) purulent exudate (n=20) and Porphyromonas, Peptostreptococcus and Fusobacterium spp. (P<0.05); previous endodontic treatment and Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus spp., P. micros, F. necrophorum (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate potential complex interactions of species resulting in characteristic clinical pictures which cannot be achieved by individual species alone. They also indicate that the microbiota of primary infected canals with apical periodontitis differs in number and in species from the secondary infected canals by using the culture technique.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of chlorhexidine and sodium hypochlorite.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate in vitro the antimicrobial activity of 0.2%, 1%, and 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX gel and CHX liquid), against endodontic pathogens and compare the results with the ones achieved by 0.5%, 1%, 2.5%, 4%, and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). A broth dilution test was performed, and the timing for irrigants to kill microbial cells was recorded and statistically analyzed. Both 2.0% gel and liquid formulations eliminated Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans in 15 seconds, whereas the gel formulation killed Enterococcus faecalis in 1 minute. All tested irrigants eliminated Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia in 15 seconds. The timing required for 1.0% and 2.0% CHX liquid to eliminate all microorganisms was the same required for 5.25% NaOCl. The antimicrobial action is related to type, concentration, and presentation form of the irrigants as well as the microbial susceptibility.
TI  - Additive antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide and chlorhexidine on common  endodontic bacterial pathogens.
AB  - It is an established procedure to use calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2] as a therapeutic component to achieve sterilization of infected root canals. Unfortunately, some bacterial species are relatively resistant to Ca(OH)2 and are therefore associated with treatment failures. The objective of this study was to identify combinations of substances that improve antimicrobial activity. Ca(OH)2 was used as a suspension or as a component of gutta-percha points. Efficacy of killing was compared for (a) Ca(OH)2 suspension alone; (b) zinc oxide (ZnO) points alone; (c) Ca(OH)2 suspension combined with ZnO points; (d) Ca(OH)2 suspension combined with ZnO/chlorhexidine points; and (e) Ca(OH)2 points combined with ZnO/chlorhexidine points. Common endodontopathogenic bacterial species (Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus intermedius) in pure cultures served as target organisms. In the in vitro assay, the antibacterial substances and approximately 10(7) colony forming units of test bacteria were co-incubated in diluted human serum under growth conditions appropriate for the single bacterial species. Samples were taken on days 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 of incubation and viable counts determined. Gram-negative bacteria were sufficiently killed by Ca(OH)2 alone. Combinations with other agents did not improve the killing kinetics. For the inactivation of the Gram-positive bacteria P. micros and S. intermedius, a combination of Ca(OH)2 and ZnO/chlorhexidine, killed the bacteria faster than Ca(OH)2 alone. For E. faecalis, combining Ca(OH)2 suspension with ZnO/chlorhexidine points lead to a faster decrease in the overall number of viable bacteria, but no test conditions lead to the complete loss of culture viability. The results of this study support the use of a combination of Ca(OH)2 and chlorhexidine for faster eradication of P. micros and S. intermedius from infected root canals.
TI  - Bacterial concentrations determine the ability to implant in the root canal system and translocate to lymph nodes in germ-free mice.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of the infecting dose on  bacterial colonization in root canal systems (RCS) and translocation to the submandibular lymph node (SML) of gnotobiotic (germ-free) mice. RCS were inoculated with 10(2) and 10(1) colony-forming units (CFU) of Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 4083) or 10(5), 10(4), 10(3), and 10(2) CFU of Prevotella nigrescens (ATCC 33563). E. faecalis implanted in 83.3% of the cases, for both inocula. Translocation was detected in 58.3% of lymph nodes for the 10(2) CFU inoculum and in 33.3% of lymph nodes for the 10(1) CFU inoculum. P. nigrescens implanted in 25%, 16.7%, 8.3%, and 0%, for the 10(5), 10(4), 10(3), and 10(2) CFU inocula, respectively, and did not translocate at any of the concentrations used. These results indicate that E. faecalis was able to implant in the RCS and translocate to the SML, whereas P. nigrescens implanted in lower percentages in the RCS and did not translocate to the SML.
TI  - Microbial susceptibility to calcium hydroxide pastes and their vehicles.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the susceptibility of some microorganisms commonly isolated from root canals to calcium hydroxide in combination with several vehicles by the agar diffusion method. Stainless-steel cylinders were placed on each inoculated agar medium. The test medications and their controls were placed inside the cylinders. The zones of growth inhibition were measured and recorded after the incubation period for each plate, and the results were analyzed statistically. Enterococcus faecalis was most resistant, whereas the anaerobic Porphyromonas endodontalis was more susceptible to all medications, followed by P. gingivalis and Prevotella intermedial intermedia. Ca(OH)2 + CMCP + glycerin showed significantly larger mean zones of inhibition when compared with the other medications. We conclude that anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria are more susceptible to calcium hydroxide pastes than facultative Gram-positive microorganisms.

TI  - Antimicrobial effectiveness of electro-chemically activated water as an endodontic irrigation solution.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effectiveness of electro-chemically activated water (ECA) as an endodontic irrigation solution. METHODOLOGY: The root canals of 60 caries-free, single-rooted, adult, maxillary, anterior human teeth were instrumented and irrigated in a similar method to that used for in vivo root canal treatment. The external root surface of each tooth was sealed, maintaining the access cavities patent and the root canals were inoculated with a suspension containing four bacteria. The teeth were randomly divided into four groups (n = 15). Each group was irrigated ultrasonically with one of the following solutions: distilled water (control), NaOCl (3.5%), and ECA, the latter at pHs 7.0 and 9.0. Antimicrobial effectiveness was established directly after irrigation and again 7 days later, by counting colony-forming units on blood agar plates and by spectrophotometric analysis. RESULTS: Large numbers of bacteria were present in the canals of teeth irrigated with distilled water. No bacteria were observed following irrigation with NaOCl. Neither of the ECA solutions were found to be effective against all the bacteria. Although some reduction in the number of bacteria was evident in the ECA groups, this was not statistically significant (P > 0.05) when compared to sodium hypochlorite. CONCLUSION: Within the confines of this study ECA did not demonstrate antimicrobial effectiveness.
TI  - Role of the Streptococcus gordonii SspB protein in the development of Porphyromonas gingivalis biofilms on streptococcal substrates.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is an aggressive periodontal pathogen that persists in the mixed-species plaque biofilm on tooth surfaces. P. gingivalis cells attach to the plaque commensal Streptococcus gordonii and this coadhesion event leads to the development of P. gingivalis biofilms. Binding of these organisms is multimodal, involving both the P. gingivalis major fimbrial FimA protein and the species-specific interaction of the minor fimbrial Mfa1 protein with the streptococcal SspB protein. This study examined the contribution of the Mfa1-SspB interaction to P. gingivalis biofilm formation. P. gingivalis biofilms readily formed on substrata of S. gordonii DL1 but not on Streptococcus mutans cells which lack a coadhesion-mediating homologue of SspB. An insertional inactivation of the mfa1 gene in P. gingivalis resulted in a phenotype deficient in S. gordonii binding and unable to form biofilms. Furthermore, analysis using recombinant streptococci and enterococci showed that P. gingivalis biofilms formed on Enterococcus faecalis strains expressing SspB or translational fusions of SspB with SpaP (the non-adherent SspB homologue in S. mutans) containing the P. gingivalis adherence domain (SspB adherence region, BAR) of SspB. In contrast, an isogenic Ssp null mutant of S. gordonii DL1 was unable to support biofilm growth, even though this strain bound to P. gingivalis FimA at levels similar to wild-type S. gordonii DL1. Finally, site-specific mutation of two functional amino acid residues in BAR resulted in SspB polypeptides that did not promote the development of P. gingivalis biofilms. These results suggest that the induction of P. gingivalis biofilms on a streptococcal substrate requires functional SspB-minor fimbriae interactions.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota of Brazilian subjects with untreated chronic periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Different periodontopathogenic microbiota have been associated with periodontal diseases in several populations. The present investigation determined the subgingival microbiota of untreated chronic periodontitis Brazilians using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique. METHODS: Twenty-five periodontitis patients (mean age, 41 +/- 2; mean probing depth [PD], 3.3 +/- 0.2; mean attachment level [AL], 3.6 +/- 0.2) with no history of previous periodontal therapy and a control group of 14 healthy subjects (mean age, 34 +/- 0.6; mean PD, 1.8 +/- 0.2; mean AL, 1.7 +/- 0.1) were selected. Measurements of PD, AL, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation, and suppuration were recorded at 6 sites/tooth. Subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 4 sites in each tooth/subject in both groups. The presence and levels of 41 subgingival species were determined in 4,032 plaque samples using whole genomic DNA probes and the checkerboard method. RESULTS: Periodontal pathogens, as well as some unusual species (E. faecalis, E. coli and Bartonella sp.), were detected significantly more often and/or in higher levels in the periodontitis group (P < 0.05). Most species were more frequently detected in interproximal sites. B. forsythus, P. gingivalis, E. nodatum, and F. nucleatum ss vincentii showed a significant positive correlation with mean PD and AL (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The subgingival microbiota of Brazilians with untreated chronic periodontitis were complex, including high proportions of periodontopathogens commonly found in other populations, as well as some unusual species.
TI  - Discrete protein determinant directs the species-specific adherence of Porphyromonas gingivalis to oral streptococci.
AB  - For pathogens to survive in the human oral cavity, they must identify a suitable  niche in the complex multispecies biofilm that exists on oral tissues. The periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis adheres to Streptococcus gordonii by interacting with a specific region of the streptococcal SspB polypeptide, designated BAR. However, it does not adhere to Streptococcus mutans, which expresses SpaP, a highly conserved homolog of SspB. Comparison of the predicted secondary structure of BAR with the corresponding region of SpaP suggested that the substitution of Asn for Gly1182 and Val for Pro1185 in SspB may confer a unique local structure that is not conserved in SpaP. A synthetic peptide of 26 amino acids that encompassed residues 1167 to 1193 of SspB promoted avid adherence of P. gingivalis, whereas a peptide derived from the region corresponding to BAR in SpaP was inactive. Substitution of Gly1182 and Pro1185 for Asn1182 and Val1185 in SspB by site-specific mutation generated proteins that were predicted to assume an SpaP-like secondary structure, and the purified proteins did not promote P. gingivalis adherence. Furthermore, Enterococcus faecalis strains expressing the site-specific mutants did not support adherence of P. gingivalis cells. In contrast, P. gingivalis adhered efficiently to E. faecalis strains expressing intact SspB or SspB-SpaP chimeric proteins containing BAR. These results suggest that a region of SspB consisting of 26 amino acids is sufficient to mediate the adherence of P. gingivalis to S. gordonii and that the species specificity of adherence arises from its interaction with a discrete structural determinant of SspB that is not conserved in SpaP.
TI  - An in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial efficacy of irrigants on biofilms of  root canal isolates.
AB  - AIM: The bactericidal effect of four antimicrobial agents was investigated against single-species biofilms derived from a range of root canal isolates. METHODOLOGY: Single-species biofilms of Prevotella intermedia, Peptostreptococcus micros, Streptococcus intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Enterococcus faecalis were generated on membrane filter discs and subjected to 15 min or 1 h incubation with 5 p.p.m. colloidal silver, 2.25% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), 0.2% chlorhexidine, 10% iodine or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) as a control. The antimicrobial activity of the agents was neutralized and the bacterial cells were harvested from the discs by vortexing, serially diluted in reduced transport fluid, plated on fastidious anaerobe agar containing 5% horse blood, incubated anaerobically and colony-forming units calculated. RESULTS: Iodine and NaOCl were more effective than chlorhexidine except against P. micros and P. intermedia where they were all 100% effective. Iodine and NaOCl elicited a 100% kill after 1 h incubation for all strains used. However, after 15 min, they showed differing bactericidal effects depending on the strain. None of the agents were effective against F. nucleatum after 15 min but NaOCl, iodine and chlorhexidine were all effective after 1 h. Colloidal silver was generally ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of a particular agent was dependent on the nature of the organism in the biofilm and on the contact time. NaOCl was generally the most effective agent tested, followed by iodine. However the clinical efficacy of these agents must be considered in light of the complex root canal anatomy and polymicrobial nature of root canal infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and flow rate of newer and established root canal sealers.
AB  - Endodontic sealers that possess both optimum flow ability and antimicrobial properties may theoretically assist in the elimination of microorganisms located in confined areas of the root canal system. The antimicrobial effects and the flow rate of the following sealers were investigated and compared: Kerr Pulp Canal Sealer EWT, Grossman's Sealer, ThermaSeal, Sealer 26, AH Plus, and Sealer Plus. The agar diffusion test was used to assess the antimicrobial activity of the sealers. In the flow assay, the sealers were placed between two glass slabs and a weight of 500 g was placed on the top of the glass. The diameters of the formed discs were recorded. All root canal sealers tested showed some antimicrobial activity against most of the microorganisms. There were no significant differences between the materials tested (p > 0.05). All root canal sealers also flowed under the conditions of this study. Statistical analysis of the results revealed that AH Plus and Kerr Pulp Canal Sealer EWT had flow values significantly superior to the other sealers tested (p > 0.05). Taken together, these findings suggest that these sealers have the potential to help in the microbial control in the root canal system.
TI  - Identification of a Porphyromonas gingivalis receptor for the Streptococcus gordonii SspB protein.
AB  - Colonization of the plaque biofilm by the oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis  is favored by the presence of antecedent organisms such as Streptococcus gordonii. Coadhesion between P. gingivalis and S. gordonii can be mediated by the SspB protein of S. gordonii; however, the P. gingivalis cognate receptor for this protein has not been identified. In this study, we identified a surface protein of P. gingivalis that interacts with the SspB protein. Coprecipitation between P. gingivalis outer membrane proteins and purified SspB protein demonstrated that a 100-kDa P. gingivalis protein bound to SspB. The 100-kDa protein also bound to an engineered strain of Enterococcus faecalis that expresses the SspB protein on the cell surface. Monospecific polyclonal antibodies to the 100-kDa protein inhibited the binding between P. gingivalis and S. gordonii in a dose-dependent manner up to 86%. Amino acid sequencing of the 100-kDa protein showed homology to a protein previously identified as the P. gingivalis minor fimbria. The minor fimbrial protein may exist as a complex with a hemagglutinin-like protein since the genes encoding these proteins are adjacent on the chromosome and are cotranscribed. Thus, the P. gingivalis receptor for S. gordonii SspB is a 100-kDa protein that structurally may be a minor fimbria-protein complex and functionally effectuates coadhesion.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis and Arnica montana against oral pathogens.
AB  - Arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. They possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. Although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. Also, the antimicrobial activity of Arnica has not been extensively investigated. Therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by Arnica and propolis extracts. Arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from Minas Gerais State were compared with controls. Fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: Candida albicans--NTCC 3736, F72; Staphylococcus aureus--ATCC 25923; Enterococcus faecalis--ATCC 29212; Streptococcus sobrinus 6715; Strep. sanguis--ATCC 10556; Strep. cricetus--HS-6; Strep. mutans--Ingbritt 1600; Strep. mutans--OMZ 175; Actinomyces naeslundii--ATCC 12104, W 1053; Act. viscosus OMZ 105; Porphyromonas gingivalis; Porph. endodontalis and Prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). Antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. To assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees C in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. To assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 M sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees C in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. Arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. The propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for Actinomyces spp. The Arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. Cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. The Arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for Strep. mutans and 15% for Strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same concentrations. Thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the Arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.
TI  - Serum antibodies reacting with subgingival species in refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to compare the levels of serum IgG antibody to 85 subgingival species in 32 refractory periodontitis, 56 successfully treated, and 33 periodontally healthy subjects. Refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or >3 sites showing attachment loss >2.5 mm within 1 year after 2 treatment modalities, scaling and root planing and surgery plus systemically administered tetracycline. Successfully-treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss >2.5 mm, 1 year post-therapy. Periodontally healthy subjects exhibited no pocket or attachment level >3 mm, and no evidence of progressing attachment loss during 1 year of monitoring. Baseline serum was obtained from each subject and tested against 85 subgingival species, including reference strains and strains isolated from refractory subjects, using checkerboard immunoblotting. Significance of differences in levels of serum antibody among groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based on their serum antibody response to subgingival species. Some individuals had antibody reactions to many subgingival species, while other subjects showed fewer or low numbers of responses. On average, refractory subjects exhibited higher numbers and levels of serum antibody reactions to a wide range of subgingival species than successfully treated or periodontally healthy subjects. Differences in serum antibody among clinical groups were more striking at higher threshold levels of antibody (>50 microg/ml and > 100 microg/ml). The data showed that a subject was 10.1 x more likely to be refractory if the subject exhibited antibody reactions with >9 subgingival species at >50 microg/ml (p<0.001, after adjusting for multiple comparisons). Serum antibody to a subset of the test species differed among the clinical groups. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroidesforsythus, and some strains isolated from refractory subjects (a novel Neisseria sp., Enterococcus faecalis, Prevotella loescheii and Prevotella oulora) elicited high serum antibody in the successfully treated and refractory subjects. High levels of serum antibody to a Microbacterium lacticum-like organism, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus constellatus, Actinobacillus actinonmycetemcomitans serotype c and Haemophilus aphrophilus significantly increased the likelihood of a subject being refractory to conventional periodontal therapy.
TI  - Experimental root canal infections in conventional and germ-free mice.
AB  - A small animal model was evaluated to study the interrelationships between microorganisms after their implantation in root canals (inferior central incisors) using germ-free (GF) and conventional (CV) mice. The selected microorganisms were: Porphyromonas endodontalis (ATCC 35406), Eubacterium lentum (ATCC 25559), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (ATCC 27337), Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC 10953), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 4083). Only P. anaerobius, E. coli, and E. faecalis, respectively, were able to colonize when inoculated alone into the root canal of both CV and GF mice. E. lentum, when inoculated alone colonized only in CV animals. P. endodontalis and F. nucleatum were unable to colonize in CV and GF animals after single inoculation. It is concluded that the experimental animal model presented herein is valuable for ecological studies of root canal infections and that only some strict anaerobic bacteria are able to colonize mice root canals when inoculated by themselves alone in pure culture.
TI  - Acid tolerance response and survival by oral bacteria.
AB  - Using 21 species of oral bacteria, representing six acidogenic genera, we undertook to determine whether the pH-limiting exponential growth is related to the ability of the organisms to generate an acid-tolerance response that results in enhanced survival at low pH. The lower pH limit of exponential growth varied by more than two units with that of Neisseria A182 at pH 6.34; growth of Lactobacillus casei RB1014 stopped at pH 3.81, with species of Actinomyces, Enterococcus, Prevotella and Streptococcus falling between these limits. The working hypothesis was that the organisms with the higher pH limits for growth are unable to respond to acidic environments in order to survive, whereas the more aciduric organisms would possess or acquire acid tolerance. Adaptation to acid tolerance was tested by determining whether the prior exposure of exponential-phase cells to a low, sub-lethal pH would trigger the induction of a mechanism that would enhance survival at a pH killing pH 7.5 control cells. The killing pH varied from pH 4.5 for Prevotella intermedia ATCC 25611 to pH 2.3 for the three Lactobacillus casei strains in the study, with the three Streptococcus mutans strains killed at pH 3.0 for 3 h. The adaptation experiments revealed three groups of organisms: non-acid-responders, generally representing strains with the highest terminal pH values; weak acid-responders in the middle of the pH list, generating low numbers of survivors at one or two pH values, and the aciduric, strong responders generating a high number of survivors at pH values in the range 6.0 to 3.5, but not at pH 7.5. Predominant among the latter group were the S. mutans and Lactobacilli casei strains, with the most significant adaptive response exhibited by S. mutans LT11 and S. mutans Ingbritt, involving a process that required protein synthesis. Time course experiments with the latter organisms indicated that 90-120 min was required after exposure to the triggering pH before the acid response was fully functional. These results indicate that the sudden exposure of strains of oral streptococci and lactobacilli, as well as Enterococcus faecalis, to pH values between 6.0 and 3.5 results in the induction of an acid tolerance response that enhances the survival of these strains at or below pH 3.5.
TI  - A scanning electron microscopic evaluation of in vitro dentinal tubules penetration by selected anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - In vitro root canal dentinal tubule invasion by selected anaerobic bacteria commonly isolated from endodontic infections was evaluated. Dentinal cylinders obtained from bovine incisors were inoculated with bacteria, and microbial penetration into tubules was demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy. The results indicated that all bacterial strains tested were able to penetrate into dentinal tubules, but to different extents.
TI  - Pathogenicity of bacteria using a simulated root canal system.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the reliability of an implantation test using Teflon-simulated root canals for evaluating the pathogenicity of root canal bacteria. Models including suspensions of lyophilized strains (Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus faecalis, and Porphyromonas asaccharolyticus) were implanted in rat subcutaneous tissue for 1 wk, and histological changes were observed. Severe inflammation occurred around the models. Among them, P. asaccharolyticus induced the severest inflammatory response. Further study using P. asaccharolyticus was conducted to compare the implantation test's ability to evaluate pathogenicity with that of an injection test at 1, 2, or 4 wk. Tissue injected with a bacterial suspension showed no clear response through the experimental periods, whereas tissue around implantation sites showed a severe response at 1 wk. However, the inflammatory response subsided at later stages. Consequently, further improvement is needed to investigate pathogenicity for long periods.
TI  - Molecules of Streptococcus gordonii that bind to Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Interbacterial binding is considered an important colonization mechanism for many of the organisms that inhabit dental plaque. Porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontal pathogen, can adhere to species that comprise early plaque, such as Streptococcus gordonii. In this study, the molecules of S. gordonii G9B that mediate binding to P. gingivalis were investigated. Biotinylated surface molecules of S. gordonii were extracted and mixed with P. gingivalis cells. Interactive streptococcal components were identified by SDS-PAGE of the P. gingivalis cells followed by electroblotting, and visualization of the adsorbed streptococcal molecules with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase. S. gordonii molecules of 45 kDa and a doublet of 62/60 kDa were observed to bind to P. gingivalis. Polyclonal antibodies raised to the 62/60 kDa proteins inhibited the binding interaction. These antibodies demonstrated an antigenic relationship between the 62/60 kDa molecules and the 45 kDa protein. Both molecules were also antigenically related to, and may be breakdown products of, a larger molecule of 170 kDa which is antigenically related to the P1 antigen of S. mutans. Cloning and expression in Enterococcus faecalis of the gene for the P1-like molecule from S. gordonii M5 resulted in a phenotype that expressed the 62/60 kDa and 45 kDa antigens and was capable of binding to P. gingivalis. These results suggest that a P1-like molecule in S. gordonii is involved in adherence to P. gingivalis. Processing of the P1-like molecule into smaller fragments of 62/60 kDa and 45 kDa may be required for binding activity.
TI  - [The bactericidal efficiency of ultrasonic in the root canal].
AB  - The objective of this paper was to determine the quantitative bactericidal efficiency of ultrasonic in the root canal. Four test organisms found frequently in the root canal were compared. The result showed ultrasonic can kill the test organisms effectively in the root canals. The best bactericidal efficiency occurred at 4 or 5 min. of ultrasonic though the more efficiency as the time longer. Bactericidal irrigation could increase the bactericidal efficiency of ultrasonic and its bactericidal action similar to irrigation bactericidal property.
TI  - Studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  - Two unique forms of periodontal disease, HIV-gingivitis and HIV-periodontitis, have been described in patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). In order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in AIDS patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 AIDS patients with periodontitis. The presence of putative periodontal pathogens including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides intermedius, Porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly B. gingivalis), and Wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 AIDS patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. Of 666 bacterial strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, Streptococcus sanguis II was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by Lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (12%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), Actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and Actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). Fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. Enteric species including Enterococcus avium and Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium clostridiiforme and Clostridium difficle as well as Klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. Immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of A. actinomycetemcomitans, B. intermedius, and P. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four times more periodontitis patients demonstrated W. recta. Subgingival yeast was a frequent finding in these AIDS patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. This study indicates that subgingival plaque in AIDS patients with periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-HIV infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.
TI  - Effect of infection with Eimeria tenella upon the cecal bacterial population in monoflora chickens.
AB  - Monoflora chickens were established at 2 days of age by an oral inoculation with  one of six species of bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium thermophilum, Bacteroides vulgatus, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, or Streptococcus faecalis) and were infected with Eimeria tenella (5 X 10(4) oocysts per bird) 2 days later. There were two experimental groups for each bacterium: birds infected with bacteria alone and birds infected with a combination of bacteria and E. tenella. Seven days after E. tenella infection, counts of B. thermophilum in the cecal contents were significantly lower for E. tenella-infected birds than for those infected by B. thermophilum alone, whereas 10 days after E. tenella infection, counts were higher for E. tennella-infected birds. The population of L. acidophilus in the cecal contents of the E. tenella-infected chickens 10 days after inoculation was significantly greater than that in uninfected chickens. No significant differences were observed between the numbers of B. vulgatus, C. perfringens, and S. faecalis in cecal contents of groups with and without E. tenella infections.
TI  - Effect of oral ciprofloxacin on the faecal flora of healthy volunteers.
AB  - The effect of oral ciprofloxacin on the intestinal flora was investigated in six  male volunteers aged between 21 and 54 years. Faecal specimens were cultured quantitatively for aerobic and anaerobic micro-organisms before, during and after a five day course of ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin resulted in a significant reduction in aerobic flora in all volunteers and colonisation with resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci or corynebacteria in two volunteers. The total anaerobic flora counts were significantly reduced in only one volunteer. Neither Clostridium difficile nor its toxin was detected and there was no significant colonisation with Pseudomonas spp. or yeasts; no ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacilli were detected. Peak serum levels on days 1 and 5 of 1.6-4.3 mg/l (mean 2.7) were achieved after 30-90 min and urine recovery over the five days was 27.1-44.6%.
TI  - Intestinal bacterial flora and host defense mechanisms.
AB  - The protective mechanisms of intestinal bacterial flora against exogenous infections will be discussed in this paper. Experimental data on protective function of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacteroides distasonis comprising intestinal flora against oral infection of Shigella flexneri which causes localized infection are presented. Furthermore, the present investigation deals with non-specific defense mechanism which indicate that protective activity of intestinal flora against parenteral infection of Salmonella typhimurium mainly depend upon the larger number of functional kupffer cells in conventional mice than in that of their germfree counterparts.
TI  - Apical periodontitis induced by selected bacterial strains in root canals of immunized and nonimmunized monkeys.
AB  - Experimental infections in root canals with Streptococcus faecalis ss. liquefaciens (Strep-MC4). Actinomyces bovis (Act-MC6) and Bacteroides oralis (Bact-MC3) were studied in four immunized and five nonimmunized monkeys. The immunization was performed using antigens of the homologous strains. The antibody level was checked by gel diffusion. In 56 root canals of the immunized animals and 60 root canals of the nonimmunized animals, viable cells of the three bacterial strains were enclosed in equal amounts of various combinations. After 6 months, samples from the root canals were subjected to qualitative and quantitative bacteriologic analyses and the apical area was radiographically and histologically examined. The analyses revealed no significant difference between the two groups of monkeys, although the viable cell recovery was slightly higher in most of the root canals of nonimmunized monkeys. The cell proportion of the strains within the different bacterial combinations was equal in root canals of the two groups of animals. The radiographic and histologic examinations revealed no significant difference between the two groups of animals regarding the number of teeth with periapical lesions. The radiographic examination, however, showed a more distinct limitation of the process in the immunized than in the nonimmunized monkeys. Histologically the lesions were more encapsulated and had a sparser cell infiltration in immunized than in nonimmunized monkeys. In the latter, inflammatory cells had often infiltrated the bone. Mixed infections gave a more severe periapical reaction than single strain infections in both animal groups.
TI  - Bacterial invasion of pulpal dentin wall in vitro.
AB  - Instrumented root canals of extracted human teeth were inoculated with known pulpal bacterial isolates. The inoculated teeth were immersed in the appropriate culture media and incubated at 37 degrees C for varying periods. Streptococci multiplied in the root canals and invaded the radicular dentinal tubules. The extent of bacterial invasion was time-dependent. This experimental model of bacterial invasion was time-dependent. This experimental model may be useful in investigating the effect of intra-canal medicaments on microorganisms lodged in the pulpal dentin wall.
TI  - Influence of antibiotics or certain intestinal bacteria on orally administered Candida albicans in germ-free and conventional mice.
AB  - Candida albicans, administered by gastric intubation, persisted in the gastrointestinal tract of gnotobiotic mice for long periods but was eliminated within a relatively short period of time in pathogen-free mice. Oxytetracycline administered by mouth had no reproducible effect on the persistence of C. albicans in the gastrointestinal tract of either germ-free or pathogen-free mice. Prolonged administration of streptomycin extended the time that C. albicans could be recovered from feces of pathogen-free mice when compared to mice not receiving the antibiotic or those receiving a single large dose. There was a brief interval of time during which C. albicans could not be recovered from the feces of gnotobiotic mice contaminated with certain intestinal bacteria, but eventually all mice began to shed the fungus again. C. albicans administered by mouth was not pathogenic for germ-free or pathogen-free mice. It can be concluded from these findings that mice do not possess an innate resistance to C. albicans but that pathogen-free mice do possess some ecological mechanism which prevents establishment of the fungus in their gastrointestinal tract. The reason for the difference in colonization of C. albicans in germ-free or gnotobiotic mice and pathogen-free mice was not determined.
