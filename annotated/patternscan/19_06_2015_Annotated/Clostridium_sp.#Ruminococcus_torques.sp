TI  == ruminococcus faecis sp. nov., isolated from human faeces.
AB  == bacterial strain eg2(t), an anaerobic, gram-positive, non-motile, and non-spore-forming coccus, was isolated from human faeces. the optimal temperature for its growth was 37 degrees c. oxidase activity was negative, but catalase activity was positive. the strain was able to hydrolyze esculin and to produce acids from the fermentation of several substrates, including glucose. lactic and  acetic acids were the main products of glucose fermentation. the major fatty acids present in this strain were c(16:0), c(14:0), and c(18:1) cis11 dma. the g+c content was 43.4 mol%. based on the 16s rrna gene sequence, strain eg2(t) was closely related to species of the genus ruminococcus (96.3% similarity to r. torques and 96.2% similarity to r. lactaris), and its taxonomic position was placed within the clostridium cluster xiva. based on phenotypic, chemotaxonomic,  genotypic, and phylogenetic evidence, we propose that this novel strain be assigned to the genus ruminococcus and be named ruminococcus faecis sp. nov. the  type strain is eg2(t) (=kctc 5757(t) =jcm 15917(t)).

TI  == clostridium glycyrrhizinilyticum sp. nov., a glycyrrhizin-hydrolysing bacterium isolated from human faeces.
AB  == screening of faecal bacteria for glycyrrhetic acid (ga) production by hydrolysing of glycyrrhizin (gl) resulted in the isolation of two strains, designated zm35t and zm38. strains zm35t and zm38 were gram-positive, obligate anaerobic, non-spore-forming and rod-shaped bacteria. analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequences indicated that strains zm35t and zm38 belonged to cluster xiva of the genus clostridium. the 16s rrna gene sequences of strains zm35t and zm38 were identical. strain zm35t exhibited approximately 94% to 95% identity with the validly described species, clostridium oroticum(94.5%), eubacterium contortum(93.8%), ruminococcus gnavus(94.5%) and r. torques(95.1%). in an experiment of dna-dna hybridization, it was confirmed that strains zm35t and zm38 were the same species. the guanine-plus-cytosine (g+c) content of strain zm35t is 45.7 mol%. based on the phylogenetic and phenotypic findings, we propose that strains zm35t and zm38 be assigned to a novel species named clostridium glycyrrhizinilyticum. the type strain is zm35t (=jcm 13368t=dsm 17593t).
