TI  == ethanol production from cellulosic materials by genetically engineered zymomonas  mobilis.
AB  == to confer the ability to ferment cello-oligosaccharides on the ethanol-producing  bacterium, zymomonas mobilis, the beta-glucosidase gene from ruminococcus albus,  tagged at its n-terminal with the 53-amino acid tat signal peptide from the periplasmic enzyme glucose-fructose oxidoreductase from z. mobilis, was introduced into the strain. the tag enabled 61% of the beta-glucosidase activity  to be transported through the cytoplasmic membrane of the recombinant strain which then produced 0.49 g ethanol/g cellobiose.
