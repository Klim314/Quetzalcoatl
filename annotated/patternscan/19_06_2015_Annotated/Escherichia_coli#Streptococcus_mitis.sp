TI  == antimicrobial activity of chemokine cxcl10 for dermal and oral microorganisms.
AB  == cxcl10 (ip-10) is a small 10 kda chemokine with antimicrobial activity. it is induced by ifn-gamma, chemoattracts mononuclear cells, and promotes adhesion of t cells. recently, we detected cxcl10 on the surface of the skin and in the oral cavity. in the current study, we used broth microdilution and radial diffusion assays to show that cxcl10 inhibits the growth of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, corynebacterium jeikeium, corynebacterium striatum, and candida albicans hmv4c, but not corynebacterium bovis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, poryphromonas gingivalis, or c. albicans atcc 64124. the reason for the selective antimicrobial activity is not yet known. however, antimicrobial activity of cxcl10 may be related to its composition and structure, as a cationic 98 amino acid residue molecule with 10 lysine residues,  7 arginine residues, a total net charge of +11, and a theoretical pi of 9.93. modeling studies revealed that cxcl10 contains an alpha-helix at the n-terminal,  three anti-parallel beta-strands in the middle, and an alpha-helix at the c-terminal. thus, cxcl10, when produced on the surface of the skin or in the oral cavity, likely has antimicrobial activity and may enhance innate antimicrobial and cellular responses to the presence of select commensal or opportunistic microorganisms.

TI  == a case of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis with bacteremia caused by shewanella  algae.
AB  == human infection caused by shewanella algae is rare, which usually occurred after  direct contact with seawater or ingestion of raw seafood in the immunocompromised host. there have been anecdotal reports about shewanella infections in human, but their pathogenic role and microbiologic data are limited. here, we report a fatal case of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis with bacteremia due to s. algae in a 57-year-old male with liver cirrhosis who had no history of exposure to seawater  or raw seafood. polymicrobial infection with streptococcus mitis and escherichia  coli was combined and the patient died in spite of early appropriate antimicrobial therapy and early goal-directed therapy for sepsis.

TI  == enzymatic treatment of specimens before dna extraction directly influences molecular detection of infectious agents.
AB  == introduction: biological samples, pharmaceuticals or food contain proteins, lipids, polymers, ammoniums and macromolecules that alter the detection of infectious agents by dna amplification techniques (pcr). moreover the targeted dna has to be released from the complex cell walls and the compact nucleoprotein  matrixes and cleared from potential inhibitors. the goal of the present work was  to assess the efficiency of enzymatic pretreatments on infectious agents to make  dna available for further extraction and amplification. methods: staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, propionibacterium acnes, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, aspergillus niger and fusarium solani were mixed with an internal control virus and treated with: 1) proteinase k; 2) lyticase and 3) lyticase followed by proteinase k. dnas was manually extracted using the qiamp dna mini kit or the magna pure compact automate. dna extraction yields and the inhibitors were assessed with a phocid herpesvirus. bacterial detection was performed using taqman real-time pcr and yeasts and filamentous fungi with hrm (real-time pcr followed by high-resolution melting analysis). results: viral dna was released, extracted and detected using manual and automatic methods without pre enzymatic treatments. either the manual or the automatic dna extraction systems did not meet the sensitivity expectations if enzymatic treatments were not performed before: lyticase for fungi and proteinase k for bacteria. the addition of lyticase and proteinase k did not improve results. for fungi the detection after lyticase was higher than for proteinase k, for which melting analysis did not allow fungal specification. discussion: columns and magnetic beads allowed collecting dna and separate pcr inhibitors. detection rates cannot be related to dna-avidity of beads or to elution but to the lack of proteolysis.

TI  == [evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
AB  == introduction: antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (snp's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for  therapeutic purposes. it is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal snp's  possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of snp's against cariogenic bacteria: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis  responsible for initiation of dental carries. tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. nanotechnology creates a  new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. methods: colloidal silver solution (css) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were  evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis and s, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs  of 7 patients treated for dental carries at department of conservative dentistry, medical university of warsaw. mic and mbc values for css's were evaluated. results: css used in this research is of good stability. no agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. mic values were: 12-25 ppm for s. salivarius, 25 ppm for s. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for s. mitis and 50 ppm for s. mutans, while mbc values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. after 24 hours of contact  mbc values were: 25-50 ppm for s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for s. mitis and 200 ppmfor s. mutans. conclusions: antimicrobial properties of css depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. the susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in  our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.

TI  == preliminary molecular analysis of bacterial composition in periapical lesions with primary endodontic infections of deciduous teeth.
AB  == background: the bacterial composition of periapical lesions in deciduous teeth has not been well documented. this study was designed to explore the bacterial compositions, especially the dominant bacteria in periapical lesions using 16s rrna sequencing. methods: tissue samples were collected from 11 periapical lesions in deciduous teeth with primary endodontic infections. dna was extracted  from each sample and analyzed using 16s rrna cloning and sequencing for the identification of bacteria. results: all dna samples were positive for 16s rrna gene pcr. one hundred and fifty-one phylotypes from 810 clones were identified to eight phyla, and each sample contained an average of 25.9 phylotypes. in addition, 59 phylotypes were detected in more than two samples, and fusobacterium (f.) nucleatum (8/11), dialister (d.) invisus (8/11), campylobacter (c.) gracilis (7/11), escherichia (e.) coli dh1 (6/11), aggregatibacter (a.) segnis (6/11), and streptococcus (s.) mitis (6/11) were the most prevalent species. furthermore, 45  as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes were also identified. conclusions: chronic periapical lesions in deciduous teeth contained polymicrobial infections. f. nucleatum, d. invisus, c. gracilis, e. coli dh1, a. segnis, and s. mitis were the most prevalent species detected by 16s rrna sequencing.

TI  == bacterial diversity in meconium of preterm neonates and evolution of their fecal  microbiota during the first month of life.
AB  == the establishment and succession of bacterial communities in infants may have a profound impact in their health, but information about the composition of meconium microbiota and its evolution in hospitalized preterm infants is scarce.  in this context, the objective of this work was to characterize the microbiota of meconium and fecal samples obtained during the first 3 weeks of life from 14 donors using culture and molecular techniques, including dgge and the human intestinal tract chip (hitchip) analysis of 16s rrna amplicons. culture techniques offer a quantification of cultivable bacteria and allow further study  of the isolate, while molecular techniques provide deeper information on bacterial diversity. culture and hitchip results were very similar but the former showed lower sensitivity. inter-individual differences were detected in the microbiota profiles although the meconium microbiota was peculiar and distinct from that of fecal samples. bacilli and other firmicutes were the main bacteria groups detected in meconium while proteobacteria dominated in the fecal samples.  culture technique showed that staphylococcus predominated in meconium and that enterococcus, together with gram-negative bacteria such as escherichia coli, escherichia fergusonii, klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia marcescens, was more abundant in fecal samples. in addition, hitchip results showed the prevalence of  bacteria related to lactobacillus plantarum and streptococcus mitis in meconium samples whereas those related to enterococcus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and yersinia predominated in the 3(rd) week feces. this study highlights that spontaneously-released meconium of preterm neonates contains a specific microbiota that differs from that of feces obtained after the first week of life. our findings indicate that the presence of serratia was strongly associated with a higher degree of immaturity and other hospital-related parameters, including antibiotherapy and mechanical ventilation.

TI  == particularities in diagnosis and treatment for infectious endocarditis in children.
AB  == infectious endocarditis (ie) represents a rare pathology in children, but with lethal potential. the goal of the therapy is fast and total eradication of the infection. aims: to study particularities in diagnosis and treatment for infectious endocarditis in children. material and methods: children with infectious endocarditis hospitalized between january 2007 - february 2012 in the  cardiology department of the ,,sfanta maria" children emergency hospital of lasi  have been included in the study. results: the patients are aged between 23 days and 16 years, the average age being 4 years old. at approximately 88% of the patients (14 cases), the endocardial damage appeared in the pre-existent valvular lesions, specially mitral and aortal. as associated congenital malformations, the patients prevailingly presented ventricular septal defect, mitral valve prolapse, arterial canal persistence, aortic stenosis, coarctation of the aorta. blood cultures were collected and the most frequent identified etiological agents were: staphylococcus coagulase-positive, streptococcus mitis, staphylococcus speciae coagulase-negative, staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus bovis, escherichia coli, for which the antibiogram showed sensitivity for beta-lactam, cephalosporins, glycopeptides, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, rifampicin, quinolone, lincosamides, oxazolidinones, and thus specific treatment was set up according to the antibiogram. conclusions: the infectious endocarditis is a serious disease that affects young age too, leading towards exitus in some cases. diagnostic imaging and early blood cultures are of relevance in order to intervene promptly. the treatment must be targeted and applied as fast as possible.

TI  == non-tuberculous mycobacteria and their surface lipids efficiently induced il-17 production in human t cells.
AB  == interleukin-17 (il-17) is produced by a subset of cd4(+) t helper (th) lymphocytes known as th17 cells. in humans, il-1beta, enhanced by il-6 and il-23  is crucial for differentiation of these cells. il-17 evokes inflammation and is involved in host defence against microorganisms, although little is known about its role in diseases caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria. the genus mycobacterium contains both obligate and opportunistic pathogens as well as saprophytes, and the mycobacterial cell envelope is unique in its abundance of lipids. here we investigated il-17 and il-23 production in human pbmc in response to intact uv-inactivated mycobacteria and mycobacterial surface lipids from two opportunistic (mycobacterium avium and mycobacterium abscessus) and one generally non-pathogenic (mycobacterium gordonae) species. representative gram-positive (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus mitis) and gram-negative (escherichia coli) bacteria were included as controls. intact mycobacteria induced production of large amounts of il-17, while il-17 responses to control bacteria were negligible. purified cd4(+) t cells, but not cd4-depleted cell fractions, produced this il-17. isolated mycobacterial surface lipids induced il-17, but not il-23 production. the ability of the non-tuberculous mycobacteria to induce il-17 production in cd4(+) t cells was the same regardless of the pathogenic potential  of the particular mycobacterial species.

TI  == assessing the oral microbiota of healthy and alcohol-treated rats using whole-genome dna probes from human bacteria.
AB  == objective: this study aimed to evaluate the capacity of whole-genome dna probes prepared from human oral bacteria to cross-react with bacteria from the oral cavity of rats, and to assess the influence of alcohol ingestion on the animals'  oral biofilm. design: twenty four mature wistar rats were equally divided in two  groups. one group (control) was fed balanced diet of rat pellets and water. the alcohol-treated group (at) received the same diet and 20% ethanol solution. upon  euthanasia after 30 days, bacterial samples from the oral biofilm covering the animals' teeth were collected using microbrushes. bacteria identification and quantification were performed using the dna checkerboard hybridization method with 33 probes prepared from human oral bacteria. signals corresponding to bacterial genome counts and percentages were compared using a mann-whitney u test with a significance level <0.05. results: cross-reaction for all targeted species, except streptococcus mutans and streptococcus mitis-like species, occurred in the control group. escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, porphyromonas endodontalis, and veillonella parvula-like species only produced detectable signals in the at group. significantly more signals were detected in the control group compared to the at group (p=0.001). the percentage of e. coli-like species was highest in both groups. conclusions: whole-genome dna probes prepared from human oral bacteria can cross-react with rats' oral bacterial species. alcohol consumption is associated with lower levels and diversity of bacterial species in the oral cavity of rats.

TI  == the surface lipids of non-tuberculous mycobacteria suppress production of phagocyte activating cytokines in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
AB  == the genus mycobacterium includes obligate pathogens as well as opportunistic and  non-pathogenic species ubiquitous in the environment. mycobacteria have a unique  cell wall abundant in lipids. here we investigated cytokine production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) in response to the opportunistic mycobacteria mycobacterium avium and mycobacterium abscessus, the non-pathogenic  mycobacterium gordonae and extracted surface lipids from the three species. the cytokine response elicited by mycobacteria, regardless of their pathogenic potential, differed distinctly from that induced by control gram-positive (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus mitis) and gram-negative (escherichia coli) bacteria. mycobacteria induced no il-12 and less tnf and ifn-gamma compared with  conventional gram-positive bacteria. il-10 was induced by all the mycobacteria and this production was partly responsible for the down-regulation of il-12 and ifn-gamma. the capacity of the gram-positive bacterium e. faecalis to induce il-12, as well as tnf and ifn-gamma, in human pbmcs was strongly reduced when mycobacterial lipids were added. the mycobacterial surface lipids down-regulated  the production of il-12 and ifn-gamma without eliciting il-10 production. our results show that mycobacteria evade triggering production of phagocyte activating cytokines (il-12, tnf and ifn-gamma) and that the mycobacterial cell wall surface lipids may play a significant role in this process.

TI  == antibacterial activity of sphingoid bases and fatty acids against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == there is growing evidence that the role of lipids in innate immunity is more important than previously realized. how lipids interact with bacteria to achieve  a level of protection, however, is still poorly understood. to begin to address the mechanisms of antibacterial activity, we determined mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of lipids common to the skin and oral cavity--the sphingoid bases d-sphingosine, phytosphingosine, and dihydrosphingosine and the fatty acids sapienic acid and lauric acid--against four gram-negative bacteria and seven gram-positive bacteria. exact kruskal-wallis tests of these values showed differences among lipid treatments (p < 0.0001) for each bacterial species except serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. d-sphingosine (mbc range, 0.3 to 19.6 mug/ml), dihydrosphingosine (mbc range, 0.6 to 39.1 mug/ml), and phytosphingosine (mbc range, 3.3 to 62.5 mug/ml) were active against all bacteria except s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa (mbc > 500 mug/ml). sapienic acid (mbc range, 31.3 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and fusobacterium nucleatum but not active against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa, corynebacterium bovis, corynebacterium striatum, and corynebacterium  jeikeium (mbc > 500 mug/ml). lauric acid (mbc range, 6.8 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against all bacteria except e. coli, s. marcescens, and p. aeruginosa (mbc > 500 mug/ml). complete killing was achieved as early as 0.5 h for some lipids but took as long as 24 h for others. hence, sphingoid bases and fatty acids have  different antibacterial activities and may have potential for prophylactic or therapeutic intervention in infection.

TI  == characterization of recombinant streptococcus mitis-derived human platelet aggregation factor.
AB  == we previously purified streptococcus mitis-derived human platelet aggregation factor (sm-hpaf) from the culture supernatant of s. mitis strain nm-65, isolated  from the tooth surface of a patient with kawasaki disease. here we produced recombinant sm-hpaf protein (rsm-hpaf) in escherichia coli, to determine whether  rsm-hpaf conserves its platelet aggregation activity. rsm-hpaf precursor (665 amino acids) shows up to 36-56% identity with the family of cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (cdcs), and rsm-hpaf displayed potent hemolytic activity toward mammalian erythrocytes, including human erythrocytes with platelet aggregation activity. the 162-amino acid amino-terminal domain of rsm-hpaf was found in no other cdcs except lectinolysin; this domain is homologous to a portion of pneumococcal fucolectin-related protein. interestingly, suilysin (sly) and pneumolysin (ply) of cdcs also exhibit substantial human platelet aggregation activity, similar to rsm-hpaf, and the platelet aggregation by rsm-hpaf, sly, and ply was morphologically confirmed using light and electron microscopy.

TI  == population genetics and evolution of the pan-genome of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == the genetic variability in bacterial species is much larger than in other kingdoms of life. the gene content between pairs of isolates can diverge by as much as 30% in species like escherichia coli or streptococcus pneumoniae. this unexpected finding led to the introduction of the concept of the pan-genome, the  set of genes that can be found in a given bacterial species. the genome of any isolate is thus composed by a "core genome" shared by all strains and characteristic of the species, and a "dispensable genome" that accounts for many  of the phenotypic differences between strains. the pan-genome is usually much larger than the genome of any single isolate and, given the ability of many bacteria to exchange genetic material with the environment, constitutes a reservoir that could enhance their ability to survive in a mutating environment.  to understand the evolution of the pan-genome of an important pathogen and its interactions with the commensal microbial flora, we have analyzed the genomes of  44 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, one of the most important causes of microbial diseases in humans. despite evidence of extensive homologous recombination, the s. pneumoniae phylogenetic tree reconstructed from polymorphisms in the core genome identified major groups of genetically related strains. with the exception of serotype 1, the tree correlated poorly with capsular serotype, geographical site of isolation and disease outcome. the distribution of dispensable genes was consistent with phylogeny, although horizontal gene transfer events attenuated this correlation in the case of ancient lineages. homologous recombination, involving short stretches of dna, was the dominant evolutionary process of the core genome of s. pneumoniae. genetic exchange with related species sharing the same ecological niche was the main mechanism of evolution of s. pneumonia; and s. mitis was the main reservoir of genetic diversity of s. pneumoniae. the pan-genome of s. pneumoniae increased logarithmically with the number of strains and linearly with the variability of the sample, suggesting that acquired genes accumulate proportionately to the age  of clones.

TI  == [etiology and epidemic characteristics of hospital acquired pneumonia in children].
AB  == objective: to investigate the etiology and epidemic characteristics of hospital acquired pneumonia (hap) in children. method: a retrospective hospital infection  study was performed in 52,639 children admitted to our hospital from january 2005 to december 2008. result: six hundred and ninety eight patients were diagnosed as hap. the incidence of hap was 1.33%, among which, 108 (15.47%) cases were early-onset hap and 590 (84.53%) were late-onset hap. the hap patients aged 3 days to 15 years (503 male and 195 female). the proportion of patients younger than 1 year was 51.4%. main underlying diseases were cytomegalovirus hepatitis, congenital heart disease, malignant tumor, granulocytopenia or agranulocytosis, prematurity and low birth weight. there was significant difference in the incidences among different departments with the highest one seen in icu, followed by departments of infectious diseases, hematology and digestive diseases. two hundred and thirty one stains of pathogens were identified from sputum of 355 cases. one hundred and fifty six (67.5%) strains were gram-negative bacteria, which accounted for the highest proportion. there were 30 (13.0%) gram-positive bacterial strains, and 29 (12.6%) respiratory tract virus strains, and 15 (6.5%)  fungal strains, and 1 (0.4%) mycoplasma strain. the predominant bacterial pathogens were klebsiella pneumoniae, followed by stenotrophomonas maltophilia, burkholderia cepacia, escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii. the isolation rates of klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli with positive extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) were 94.8% and 85.7%, respectively. those two bacteria were universally resistant to the third and forth generations  cephalosporins. the main pathogens of early-onset hap were respiratory syncytial  virus (rsv), streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumonia, haemophilus influenzae and klebsiella pneumoniae, while the main pathogens of late-onset hap were esbls-positive klebsiella pneumonia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, burkholderia cepacia, escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii. conclusion: hap in children is most common in children younger than 1 year and with underlying diseases. the main pathogens are gram-negative bacteria. rsv was an important pathogen of hap. the pathogens of early-onset hap are different from those of late-onset hap. these results may be of some help in prevention and control of hap in children and in guiding for rational application of antibiotics, especially the empirical antibiotic choice.

TI  == oxygen tension modulates the cytokine response of oral epithelium to periodontal  bacteria.
AB  == background: there is an inverse relationship between pocket depth and pocket oxygen tension with deep pockets being associated with anaerobic bacteria. however, little is known about how the host tissues respond to bacteria under differing oxygen tensions within the periodontal pocket. aim: to investigate the  effect of different oxygen tensions upon nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappab) activation and the inflammatory cytokine response of oral epithelial cells when exposed to nine species of oral bacteria. materials and methods: h400 oral epithelial cells were equilibrated at 2%, 10% or 21% oxygen. cells were stimulated with heat-killed oral bacteria at multiplicity of infection 10:1, escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (15 mug/ml) or vehicle control. interleukin-8 (il-8) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and nf-kappab activation was measured by reporter vector or by immunohistochemical analysis. results: tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia elicited the greatest epithelial nf-kappab activation and cytokine responses. an oxygen-tension-dependent trend in cytokine production was observed with the highest il-8 and tnf-alpha production observed at 2% oxygen and lowest at 21% oxygen. conclusions: these data demonstrate a greater pro-inflammatory host response and cell signalling response to bacteria present in more anaerobic conditions, and hypersensitivity of epithelial cells to pro-inflammatory stimuli  at 2% oxygen, which may have implications for disease pathogenesis and/or therapy.

TI  == aerobic bacteria from mucous membranes, ear canals, and skin wounds of feral cats in grenada, and the antimicrobial drug susceptibility of major isolates.
AB  == in a 2-year period 54 feral cats were captured in grenada, west indies, and a total of 383 samples consisting of swabs from rectum, vagina, ears, eyes, mouth,  nose and wounds/abscesses, were cultured for aerobic bacteria and campylobacters. a total of 251 bacterial isolates were obtained, of which 205 were identified to  species level and 46 to genus level. a commercial bacterial identification system (api/biomerieux), was used for this purpose. the most common species was escherichia coli (n=60), followed by staphylococcus felis/simulans (40), s. hominis (16), s. haemolyticus (12), streptococcus canis (9), proteus mirabilis (8), pasteurella multocida (7), streptococcus mitis (7), staphylococcus xylosus (7), s. capitis (6), s. chromogenes (4), s. sciuri (3), s. auricularis (2), s. lentus (2), s. hyicus (2), streptococcus suis (2) and pseudomonas argentinensis (2). sixteen other isolates were identified to species level. a molecular method  using 16s rrna sequencing was used to confirm/identify 22 isolates. salmonella or campylobacters were not isolated from rectal swabs. e. coli and s. felis/simulans together constituted 50% of isolates from vagina. s. felis/simulans was the most  common species from culture positive ear and eye samples. p. multocida was isolated from 15% of mouth samples. coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common isolates from nose and wound swabs. staphylococcus aureus, or s. intemedius/s. pseudintermedius were not isolated from any sample. antimicrobial drug resistance was minimal, most isolates being susceptible to all drugs tested  against, including tetracycline.

TI  == metagenomic detection of phage-encoded platelet-binding factors in the human oral cavity.
AB  == the human oropharynx is a reservoir for many potential pathogens, including streptococcal species that cause endocarditis. although oropharyngeal microbes have been well described, viral communities are essentially uncharacterized. we conducted a metagenomic study to determine the composition of oropharyngeal dna viral communities (both phage and eukaryotic viruses) in healthy individuals and  to evaluate oropharyngeal swabs as a rapid method for viral detection. viral dna  was extracted from 19 pooled oropharyngeal swabs and sequenced. viral communities consisted almost exclusively of phage, and complete genomes of several phage were recovered, including escherichia coli phage t3, propionibacterium acnes phage pa6, and streptococcus mitis phage sm1. phage relative abundances changed dramatically depending on whether samples were chloroform treated or filtered to  remove microbial contamination. pbla and pblb genes of phage sm1 were detected in the metagenomes. pbla and pblb mediate the attachment of s. mitis to platelets and play a significant role in s. mitis virulence in the endocardium, but have never previously been detected in the oral cavity. these genes were also identified in salivary metagenomes from three individuals at three time points and in individual saliva samples by pcr. additionally, we demonstrate that phage  sm1 can be induced by commonly ingested substances. our results indicate that the oral cavity is a reservoir for pbla and pblb genes and for phage sm1 itself. further studies will determine the association between pbla and pblb genes in the oral cavity and the risk of endocarditis.

TI  == identification and characterization of amylase-binding protein c from streptococcus mitis ns51.
AB  == a substantial proportion of the streptococcal species found in dental plaque biofilms are able to interact with the abundant salivary enzyme alpha-amylase. these streptococci produce proteins that specifically bind amylase. an important  plaque species, streptococcus mitis, secretes a 36-kda amylase-binding protein into the extracellular milieu. proteins precipitated from s. mitis ns51 cell culture supernatant by the addition of purified salivary amylase were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a membrane, and a prominent 36-kda band was cut from the membrane and sequenced to  yield the n-terminal amino acid sequence dsqaqysngv. searching the s. mitis genome sequence database revealed a single open reading frame containing this sequence, and the gene was amplified by the s. mitis genomic dna polymerase chain reaction. the coding region of this open reading frame, designated amylase-binding protein c (abpc), was cloned into an escherichia coli expression  vector and the recombinant abpc (rabpc) was purified from the soluble fraction of the e. coli cell lysate. purified abpc was found to interact with immobilized amylase, confirming abpc as a new streptococcal amylase-binding protein.

TI  == photodynamic inactivation of escherichia coli and streptococcus mitis by cationic zinc(ii) phthalocyanines in media with blood derivatives.
AB  == the photodynamic inactivation (pdi) of escherichia coli and streptococcus mitis sensitized by cationic phthalocyanines was studied in different media containing  blood derivatives. first, the activity of zinc(ii) tetramethyltetrapyridino[3,4-b:3',4'-g:3'',4''-l:3''',4'''-q]porphyrazinium (znapc4+), zinc(ii) 2,9,16,23-tetrakis[4-(n-methylpyridyloxy)]phthalocyanine (znppc4+) and zinc(ii) 2,9,16,23-tetrakis[2-(n,n,n-trimethylamino)ethoxy]phthalocyanine (znepc4+) were compared to photoinactivate these bacteria in saline solutions. after visible light irradiation, a higher photoinactivation of e. coli cells was found for znppc4+, while znepc4+ was the more effective sensitizer to eradicate s. mitis cells. in the presence of human red blood (hrb) cells, two aspects were analyzed: the photohemolysis induced by these cationic phthalocyanines and the pdi of bacteria in medium containing erythrocytes. the highest photohemolytic damage was produced by znppc4+, which can be avoided using azida ion as photoprotective quencher. in both bacteria, the photoinactivation is possible in presence of hrb  cells. mainly, znepc4+ is effective to photoinactivate s. mitis with a low hemolysis of erythrocytes. however, inactivation of e. coli by znppc4+ decreases  in medium with hrb cells, further when azide ion is added to avoid hemolysis. the presence of plasma considerable reduces the photocytotoxic effect, which mainly affects the eradication of e. coli. however, the pdi of s. mitis by znepc4+ is even possible in presence of blood derivatives.

AB  == a streptococcus mitis genomic dna fragment carrying the smt1224 gene encoding a putative beta-galactosidase was identified, cloned, and expressed in escherichia  coli. this gene encodes a protein 2,411 amino acids long with a predicted molecular mass of 268 kda. the deduced protein contains an n-terminal signal peptide and a c-terminal choline-binding domain consisting of five consensus repeats, which facilitates the anchoring of the secreted enzyme to the cell wall. the choline-binding capacity of the protein facilitates its purification using deae-cellulose affinity chromatography, although its complete purification was achieved by constructing a his-tagged fusion protein. the recombinant protein was characterized as a monomeric beta-galactosidase showing a specific activity of around 2,500 u/mg of protein, with optimum temperature and ph ranges of 30 to 40  degrees c and 6.0 to 6.5, respectively. enzyme activity is not inhibited by glucose, even at 200 mm, and remains highly stable in solution or immobilized at  room temperature in the absence of protein stabilizers. in s. mitis, the enzyme was located attached to the cell surface, but a significant activity was also detected in the culture medium. this novel enzyme represents the first beta-galactosidase having a modular structure with a choline-binding domain, a peculiar property that can also be useful for some biotechnological applications.

TI  == the impact of the stone age diet on gingival conditions in the absence of oral hygiene.
AB  == background: the objective of this study was to assess the oral microbiota and clinical data in subjects without access to traditional oral hygiene methods and  who ate a diet available in the stone age. methods: ten subjects living in an environment replicating the stone age for 4 weeks were enrolled in this study. bleeding on probing (bop), gingival and plaque indices, and probing depth (pd) were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. microbiologic samples were collected at the mesio-buccal subgingival aspects of all teeth and from the dorsum of the tongue and were processed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization methods. results: no subject had periodontitis. mean bop decreased from 34.8% to 12.6% (p <0.001).  mean gingival index scores changed from 0.38 to 0.43 (not statistically significant) and mean plaque scores increased from 0.68 to 1.47 (p <0.001). pd at sites of subgingival sampling decreased (mean difference: 0.2 mm; p <0.001). at week 4, the total bacterial count was higher (p <0.001) for 24 of 74 species, including bacteroides ureolyticus, eikenella corrodens, lactobacillus acidophilus, capnocytophaga ochracea, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, haemophilus influenzae, helicobacter pylori, porphyromonas endodontalis, staphylococcus aureus (two strains), streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus anginosis, and streptococcus mitis. bacterial counts from tongue samples were higher at baseline (p <0.001) for 20 species, including tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; serotype a), and streptococcus  spp. conclusions: the experimental gingivitis protocol is not applicable if the diet (e.g., stone age) does not include refined sugars. although plaque levels increased, bop and pd decreased. subgingival bacterial counts increased for several species not linked to periodontitis, whereas tongue bacterial samples decreased during the study period.

TI  == differentiation of streptococcus pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak isolates by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus [pnc]) is a causative agent of many infectious diseases, including pneumonia, septicemia, otitis media, and conjunctivitis. there have been documented conjunctivitis outbreaks in which nontypeable (nt), nonencapsulated pnc has been identified as the etiological agent. the use of mass spectrometry to comparatively and differentially analyze protein and peptide profiles of whole-cell microorganisms remains somewhat uncharted. in this report, we discuss a comparative proteomic analysis between nt s. pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak strains (cpnc) and other known typeable or  nt pneumococcal and streptococcal isolates (including pnc tigr4 and r6, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes) and nonstreptococcal isolates (including escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus) as controls. cpnc cells and controls were grown to mid-log phase, harvested, and subsequently treated with a 10% trifluoroacetic acid-sinapinic acid matrix mixture. protein and peptide fragments of the whole-cell bacterial isolate-matrix combinations ranging in size from 2 to 14 kda were evaluated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. additionally random forest analytical tools and dendrogramic representations (genesis) suggested similarities and clustered the isolates into distinct clonal groups, respectively. also, a peak list of protein and peptide masses was obtained and compared to a known pnc protein mass library, in which a peptide common and unique to cpnc isolates was tentatively identified. information gained from this  study will lead to the identification and validation of proteins that are commonly and exclusively expressed in cpnc strains which could potentially be used as a biomarker in the rapid diagnosis of pneumococcal conjunctivitis.

TI  == risk of bacteremia in bleeding and nonbleeding gastric varices after endoscopic injection of cyanoacrylate.
AB  == background and study aim: bacteremia is common in cirrhosis with gastrointestinal bleeding, including variceal bleeding. elective esophageal sclerotherapy and banding have been reported to cause bacteremia. the risk associated with therapeutic endoscopy in patients with gastric varices has not yet been reported. this study was conducted to compare the risk of bacteremia between patients with  active gastric variceal bleeding and those with gastric varices that were not actively bleeding who underwent n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate injection. patients and methods: patients were categorized into three groups: group i, patients with bleeding gastric varices who underwent cyanoacrylate injection for hemostasis (n  = 20); group ii, patients who underwent elective cyanoacrylate injection for further obliteration of gastric varices (n = 18); and group iii, patients with cirrhosis who underwent endoscopic surveillance for varices, and patients with gastric varices who presented for a follow-up endoscopy without a requirement for treatment (n = 17). blood culture was obtained before and 5 minutes and 3 hours after endoscopy. needle tips were also sent for culture. results: before procedures, blood cultures were positive in 4 patients (20 %) from group i. the number of positive blood cultures in group i at 5 minutes and 3 hours after the procedure were 3 (15 %) and 2 (10 %) respectively. the identified organisms were: klebsiella pneumoniae (2), escherichia coli (1), vibrio cholerae non-o1 (1). no patient from group ii had a positive culture at any point of blood drawn. only one in group iii had a positive culture, for streptococcus mitis at 5 minutes. no clinical evidence of infections occurred in any patient. needle-tip cultures grew mainly organisms from the oral and gastrointestinal tracts. conclusions: elective cyanoacrylate injection for nonbleeding gastric varices is not associated with significant bacteremia or infection. for this reason, prophylactic antibiotics may not be needed in this patient group. by contrast, prophylactic antibiotics are strongly recommended for patients with bleeding gastric varices undergoing cyanoacrylate injection.

TI  == a quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  == objectives: toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. this can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. in this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. methods: fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. microorganisms were enumerated and identified. bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated pbs solution  for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. results: counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) cfu. candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. no obligate anaerobes were isolated. members of streptococcaceae family were regularly found  (65.2%) belonging to the following species: streptococcus pyogenes, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. sobrinus, s. viridans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, aerococcus viridans. a. viridans and s. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were found on adults  brushes. escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp. and enterococcus sp., were also recovered. we found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. however, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. conclusions: ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.

TI  == the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of abrus precatorius (l) fabaceae extract on  some clinical pathogens.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activities of the extracts  of abrus precatorius on some clinical isolates as resistance to available and affordable antibiotics by these pathogens is on the increase. method: in this study the antimicrobial effects of the extracts of abrus precatorius from leaves, stem and the seed oil were tested against staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, three clinical s. aureus isolates from different sources, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus anginosus (s.milleri), bacillus subtilis, corynebacterium spp (toxigenic strain of the mitis biotype), escherichia coli atcc 25922, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as candida albicans using the agar well diffusion technique. aqueous and methanolic extraction, using the soxhlet extractor was carried out on all plant parts used while petroleum ether was the solvent used to extract the seed oil. to measure the mic values, various concentrations of the stock, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8 and 4 microg/ml were assayed against the test bacteria. result: at the  different concentrations of the extracts used (512 microg/ml - 4 microg/ml), staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive organism with an mic of 8 ug/ml for  the leaf extract. extract from the stem and seed oil were potent against some of  the gram-positive bacteria and candida albicans but not against s anginosus, e. faecalis and gram-negative bacteria tested. the ph of the extracts ranged between ph5 and ph8. this study demonstrates that abrus precatorius particularly the seed oil has a potent antimicrobial activity. conclusion: the results substantiate the ethno botanical use of different parts of abrus precatorius for the treatment of  various bacteria-related diseases. topical application of abrus precatorius extracts in ointments may be recommended especially for treating superficial infections caused by staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == prospective assessment of the role of antibiotic prophylaxis in ercp.
AB  == background/aims: despite the existence of published recommendations, various studies of antibiotic prophylaxis have reached conflicting conclusions, and controversy exists regarding the role of antibiotic prophylaxis in ercp. the aim  of this study was to analyze the efficacy of the intramuscular administration of  clindamicine and gentamicine before ercp. methodology: sixty-one consecutive patients referred for ercp were prospectively randomized to receive either clindamicine 600mg and gentamicine 80mg, both intramuscularly one hour before the ercp (group i; 31 patients) or not (group ii; 30 patients). two blood samples were obtained from every patient (just before endoscopy and within 5 minutes of withdrawal of the endoscope) and were incubated for 7 days and examined daily for growth of bacteria. patients were closely monitored for 7 days after endoscopy to detect the development of infectious complications. results: only 7 cultures from 7 patients were positive. four were obtained post-ercp (two patients in group i and two in group ii) and the remaining three before endoscopy. the post-ercp isolated bacteria were: streptococcus mitis, peptoestreptococcus anaerobious, moraxella spp and escherichia coli. two patients, one from each group, developed  post-ercp cholangitis that were solved with medical treatment. conclusions: our findings indicate that ercp induce bacteremia in a small group of patients and suggest that prophylactic administration of clindamicine plus gentamicine does not reduce the incidence of bacteremia and cholangitis, and do not support the routine use of prophylactic antibiotics prior to ercp.

TI  == horizontal transfer of the immunoglobulin a1 protease gene (iga) from streptococcus to gemella haemolysans.
AB  == bacterial iga1 proteases share the ability to cleave human iga1 at the hinge region. nature has developed this trait along at least five independent evolutionary lineages. to obtain further insight into the phylogeny and function  of iga1 proteases, the nucleotide sequence of the iga gene that encodes the iga1  protease was determined from two streptococcus mitis strains and one gemella haemolysans strain. heterologous expression in escherichia coli confirmed that the genes encode human iga1-cleaving activity. iga1 proteases from streptococcus  and g. haemolysans shared structural features, including a motif typical for zinc-dependent metalloproteases of clan ma(e) family m26 and an n-terminal signal sequence followed by an lpxtg cell-wall-anchor motif and two putative membrane-spanning domains. in addition, they all harboured a repeat region preceding the active site of the protease. in the streptococcal iga1 proteases, a g5 domain, which has been suggested to bind n-acetylglucosamine, was identified.  conservation of these structures in otherwise diverse proteases suggests that they are essential to the biological function of the enzyme. the phylogenetic distribution of homologous iga genes and conservation of gene order in the iga gene region in different streptococcus species, combined with the sequence homologies, strongly suggest that the iga gene is more ancient in streptococcus than in g. haemolysans, and therefore that the iga1 protease gene was transferred from streptococcus to g. haemolysans.

TI  == molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  == the complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. however, studies  on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. to clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16s rdna sequences from the dna isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16s rdna libraries were constructed with the amplicons of pcr conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. nine independent libraries were produced  by the application of three sets of primers (set a, set b, and set c) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. the library clone with set a universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. thus, set a primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. on the first day of the life of the infant, enterobacter, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, and streptococcus mitis were present. the largest taxonomic group was l. lactis. on the third day of the  life of the infant, enterobacter, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, s. mitis, and streptococcus salivarius were present. on the sixth day of the life of the infant, citrobacter, clostridium difficile, enterobacter sp., enterobacter cloacae, and e. coli were present. the largest taxonomic group was e. coli. these results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after  the third day.

TI  == in-house validation of the bactec 9240 blood culture system for detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: at present, only two commercially available automated culture systems are cleared by the fda for the purpose of quality control (qc) testing for bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates: the bact/alert blood culture system (biomerieux) and the pall ebds (pall corporation), both of which allow testing of leukoreduced apheresis as well as whole blood-derived plts. after the decision of the aabb to institute universal qc testing of plt concentrates for evidence of bacterial contamination, in-house validation of the  performance of our current blood culture system, the bactec 9240, was carried out for this purpose. study design and methods: serial dilutions of nine species of bacteria commonly associated with plt contamination were prepared in one single-donor apheresis plt unit per organism. four ml of dilutions containing less than 1 to greater than 10(3) colony-forming units (cfus) per ml was inoculated into blood culture bottles (standard 10 aerobic/f, becton-dickinson diagnostic systems) and incubated in a bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system. positive bottles were removed from the system and subcultured to  insure the identity of bacterial growth. results: with the exception of streptococcus mitis, the bactec system provided a detection sensitivity of less than 10 cfus per ml for staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the limit of detection for the  s. mitis test strain was 61 cfus per ml. detection of positive bottles ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 hours depending on the species tested and the cell density of the inoculum. ongoing use of this system for bacterial detection yielded two true-positive samples from 3879 apheresis plt products collected at our hospital-based donor center over 9 months. conclusion: this study validates the use of the bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system for the detection of low-level bacterial contamination in single donor apheresis plts in  less than 24 hours.

TI  == detection of heat shock proteins but not superantigen by isolated oral bacteria from patients with behcet's disease.
AB  == we isolated bacteria from periodontal sites and mixed saliva in eight patients with behcet's disease and surveyed them to determine whether they produced heat shock proteins (hsps) and superantigen. cultivable bacterial compositions from periodontal sites and saliva were examined by anaerobic culture using blood agar  plates. gram-negative anaerobic rods such as prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and capnocytophaga species were predominant in the isolates from the subgingival plaque samples. the streptococcus mitis group was the most common type isolated from the saliva samples. to detect the production of hsps, western  blot analyses were performed using a polyclonal rabbit antibody to escherichia coli dnak and a monoclonal antibody to helicobacter pylori gro-el. sonic extracts of 27 of the strains (79.4%) reacted with the antibody against e. coli dnak. nine of these 34 strains (26.5%) were found to produce hsps that reacted with antibody to h. pylori gro-el. a total of 54 isolates were examined for superantigen activity against human peripheral leukocytes. twenty-five gram-negative clinical  strains isolated from chronic periodontitis lesions and 20 atcc strains of microorganisms were also examined. we could not detect any superantigen activity  in 500x diluted supernatant of the strains isolated from the eight patients with  behcet's disease. the present study indicates that the anaerobic strains isolated from the oral cavity of these patients produce hsps, the production being related to bechet's disease.

TI  == characterization of lyta-like n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidases from two new streptococcus mitis bacteriophages provides insights into the properties of the major pneumococcal autolysin.
AB  == two new temperate bacteriophages exhibiting a myoviridae (phib6) and a siphoviridae (phiher) morphology have been isolated from streptococcus mitis strains b6 and her 1055, respectively, and partially characterized. the lytic phage genes were overexpressed in escherichia coli, and their encoded proteins were purified. the lytaher and lytab6 genes are very similar (87% identity) and appeared to belong to the group of the so-called typical lyta amidases (atypical  lyta displays a characteristic two-amino-acid deletion signature). although they  exhibited several differential biochemical properties with respect to the pneumococcal lyta, e.g., they were inhibited in vitro by sodium deoxycholate and  showed a more acidic ph for optimal activity. however, and in sharp contrast with the pneumococcal lyta, a short dialysis of lytaher or lytab6 resulted in reversible deconversion to the low-activity state (e-form) of the fully active phage amidases (c-form). comparison of the amino acid sequences of lytaher and lytab6 with that of the pneumococcal amidase suggested that val317 might be responsible for at least some of the peculiar properties of s. mitis phage enzymes. site-directed mutagenesis that changed val317 in the pneumococcal lyta amidase to a thr residue (characteristic of lytab6 and lytaher) produced a fully  active pneumococcal enzyme that differs from the parental one only in that the mutant amidase can reversibly recover the low-activity e-form upon dialysis. this is the first report showing that a single amino acid residue is involved in the conversion process of the major s. pneumoniae autolysin. our results also showed  that some lysogenic s. mitis strains possess a lyta-like gene, something that was previously thought to be exclusive to streptococcus pneumoniae. moreover, the newly discovered phage lysins constitute a missing link between the typical and atypical pneumococcal amidases known previously.

AB  == streptococcus oralis 264-3, streptococcus mitis 254-1 and s. mitis 264-1, isolated from the oral cavities of two children were each found to carry the tet(m) gene but exhibited different degrees of reduced susceptibility to tetracycline (tetracycline mics of 2, 8 and 64 mg/l, respectively). the aim of this study was to determine the molecular basis for the different levels of tetracycline resistance (tc(r)) observed. escherichia coli hb101 carrying the cloned tet(m) genes exhibited similar levels of tetracycline susceptibility to those observed in the parental streptococcal strains (mics of 1, 16, and 64 mg/l  for tet(m) genes from s. oralis 264-3, s. mitis 254-1 and s. mitis 264-1, respectively). dna sequencing revealed that s. oralis 264-3 had a tet(m) gene highly homologous to tet(m) carried by tn916 from enterococcus faecalis (99.6% identity), while the intermediate- and high-level tc(r) strains had tet(m) sequences that resembled the tet(m) gene of tn5251 from streptococcus pneumoniae  (99.3% and 99.4% identity, respectively). no differences were observed in the upstream attenuator structure for each of the strains and differences in reduced  tetracycline susceptibilities could be attributed to changes in the deduced amino acid sequences of the tet(m) proteins.

TI  == innate immune responses of human neonatal cells to bacteria from the normal gastrointestinal flora.
AB  == the hygiene hypothesis postulates that the prevalence of allergy has increased due to decreased microbial stimulation early in life, leading to delayed maturation of the immune system. the aim of this study was to examine the cytokine pattern produced from cord blood mononuclear cells relative to adult cells after stimulation with bacterial strains from the normal flora. mononuclear cells from cord and adult blood samples were stimulated with the following bacteria: bifidobacterium adolescentis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus mitis, corynebacterium minutissimum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides vulgatus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, veillonella parvula, and neisseria sicca. the levels of interleukin 12 (il-12), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-10, and il-6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the tnf-alpha production was also analyzed after blocking cd14, toll-like receptor 2 (tlr-2), and tlr-4 prior to stimulation with bacteria. the levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha were similar in cord and adult cells. gram-positive bacteria induced considerably higher levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha than gram-negative bacteria in both cord and adult cells. the levels of il-6 were significantly higher in newborns than in adults, whereas the levels of  il-10 were similar in newborns and adults. gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria induced similar levels of il-6 and il-10 in cord cells. l. plantarum bound or signaled through cd14, tlr-2, and tlr-4, whereas e. coli acted mainly through cd14 and tlr-4. these results indicate that the innate immune response in newborns to commensal bacteria is strong and also suggest that different bacterial strains may have differential effects on the maturation of the immune system of infants.

TI  == a retrospective investigation of advanced periodontal disease as a risk factor for septicemia in hematopoietic stem cell and bone marrow transplant recipients.
AB  == objective: septicemia is a cause of death in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (hsct) recipients. extraction of teeth with advanced periodontitis has been advocated before hsct to prevent septicemia in myeloablated hosts. the primary aim of the present study was to determine impact of chronic periodontitis, as measured by radiographic alveolar bone loss, on septicemia and transplant mortality. study design: a retrospective design was used to study 77 subjects who received pretransplant dental evaluation, panoramic radiography, and full myeloablative allogeneic hsct to treat hematologic malignancies. radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss was measured with a schei ruler on all teeth. microorganisms isolated from positive blood cultures within the first 100 days after transplant were categorized as of likely origin from periodontal, oral, or  any body sites. spearman correlation and logistic regression analysis assessed associations between positive blood cultures, mean subject whole-mouth percent radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss, and 100-day survival. results: radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss per study subject averaged 13% +/- 7%, with 18.2% exhibiting bone loss of 20% or greater. during the initial 100 days after transplant, 63.6% subjects yielded septicemia-associated positive blood cultures, with staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli as the most common isolates recovered. no statistically significant associations were found between mean subject radiographic alveolar bone loss and septicemia of likely periodontal or oral origin. conclusion: in this preliminary study, no relationship was found between radiographic periodontal status and septicemia or  mortality within the initial 100 days after transplant. a larger-sized, prospective study is warranted to further delineate the risk of septicemia from periodontal and other oral diseases in immunocompromised patients.

AB  == xerd belongs to the site specific recombinases of the integrase family of proteins that catalyze recombination events via a phosphotyrosine intermediate. sequence alignments and crystal structure resolution of e. coli xerd and related  enzymes demonstrated the importance of four conserved amino acids r-h-r-h that are spaced along the c-terminal domain in addition to a conserved k and the active site y, all of which have been implicated in catalysis. the deduced amino  acid sequence of the putative s. pneumoniae xerd contained three unique replacements at the conserved positions resulting in l-q-r-l; moreover, the active site y was the penultimate amino acid residue, and the extreme c-terminal  region suggested to be involved in interaction of e. coli xerd with xerc was lacking. severe growth defects in a loss-of-function xerd mutant are consistent with an important in vivo function of the s. pneumoniae xerd protein. highly related xerd genes with similar unusual amino acid replacements were found in s.  mitis, s. mutans and s. pyogenes but not in other gram-positive bacteria, although the genetic environment was very similar in many species. there are at least another four genes in the s. pneumoniae knr_7/87 genome encoding xer related peptides, one of which was identified as the xerc homologue. the xerd and xerc genes were present in a sample of 20 s. pneumoniae strains whereas the other xer genes appear to be absent in some of the strains and are more closely related to integrases of phage and transposon origin.

TI  == [utility of prolonged incubation and terminal subcultures of blood cultures from  immunocompromised patients].
AB  == the value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the fundacion favaloro, the fundacion para la lucha contra las enfermedades neurologicas de la infancia and the hospital de ninos ricardo gutierrez. a total  of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). bact-alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees c for 30 days in the bact-alert system. bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and sabouraud agar. a total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. the positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). the median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. the microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), escherichia coli (n = 18), acinetobacter spp (n = 9), candida spp (n = 8), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), enterococcus faecalis, salmonella spp and capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecium, citrobacter diversus, candida albicans, klebsiella oxytoca, chryseomonas luteola, serratia marcescens, abiotrophia spp, campylobacter jejuni, moraxella catarrhalis, moraxella urethralis, neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group g streptococci, rhodococcus equi, micrococcus spp, cryptococcus neoformans  and streptococcus mitis (n = 1). in our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.

TI  == population dynamics of streptococcus mitis in its natural habitat.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to examine the genetic structure of the typical commensal streptococcus mitis biovar 1 in its natural habitat in the human oral cavity and pharynx and to investigate the role that selected microbial properties and host, spatial, and temporal factors play in determining the structure of the  bacterial population. consecutive samples were collected from buccal and pharyngeal mucosal surfaces of two infants, their four parents, and two elderly individuals over a period of approximately 1 year. a total of 751 isolates identified as s. mitis biovar 1 were typed by restriction endonuclease analysis (rea) and representative clones were typed by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (mlee). the genetic diversity of the s. mitis biovar 1 isolates collected from single infant hosts over a period of 9 to 10 months was found to be between 0.69  and 0.76, which is considerably higher than that previously observed for intestinal populations of escherichia coli. the study provides evidence of the existence of both transient and persistent clones in adult individuals. in the two infants, however, none of 42 demonstrated clones were detected on more than a single occasion. statistical calculations showed that the ability to persist was  not distributed at random in the s. mitis biovar 1 population. however, neither immunoglobulin a1 protease activity nor the ability to bind alpha-amylase from saliva was a preferential characteristic of persistent genotypes. in contrast to  current concepts of climax ecosystems, the species niche in the habitat appears to be maintained predominantly by a succession of clones rather than by stable strains. several lines of evidence suggest that the major origin of "new" clones  is the many other habitats in the respiratory tract that are occupied by this species.

TI  == streptococcal histone induces murine macrophages to produce interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha.
AB  == the histone-like protein (hlpa) is highly conserved among streptococci. after lysis of streptococci in infected tissues, hlpa can enter the bloodstream and bind to proteoglycans in the glomerular capillaries of kidneys, where it can react with antibodies or stimulate host cell receptors. deposits of streptococcal antigens in tissues have been associated with localized acute inflammation. in this study, we measured the ability of purified hlpa (5 to 100 microg/ml), from streptococcus mitis, to induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines by cultured, murine peritoneal macrophages. the release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin-1 (il-1) was time and concentration dependent and was not diminished by the presence of polymyxin b. exposure of macrophages to a mixture of hlpa and lipoteichoic acid resulted in a synergistic response in the production of both tnf-alpha and il-1. stimulation with a mixture of hlpa and heparin resulted in reduced cytokine production (50% less il-1 and 76% less tnf-alpha) compared to that by cells incubated with hlpa alone. the inclusion of  antibodies specific to hlpa in macrophage cultures during stimulation with hlpa did not affect the quantity of tnf-alpha or il-1 produced. these observations suggest that streptococcal histone may contribute to tissue injury at infection sites by promoting monocytes/macrophages to synthesize and release cytokines that initiate and exacerbate inflammation. streptococcus pyogenes, which can infect tissues in enormous numbers, may release sufficient amounts of hlpa to reach the  kidneys and cause acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.

TI  == bacteremic pneumonia in neutropenic patients with cancer: causes, empirical antibiotic therapy, and outcome.
AB  == background: bacteremic pneumonia is a major cause of death among neutropenic patients with cancer. methods: we analyzed the causes, empirical antibiotic therapy, and outcome of 40 consecutive cases of bacteremic pneumonia identified among 408 episodes of bacteremia in adult neutropenic patients with cancer, prospectively documented from 1986 to 1995. results: the most frequent causative  organisms were pseudomonas aeruginosa (17 cases), streptococcus pneumoniae (12 cases), escherichia coli (5 cases), and streptococcus mitis (3 cases). overall, p. aeruginosa and s. pneumoniae caused 72.5% of all episodes of bacteremic pneumonia, compared with 11.4% of bacteremic episodes from other sources (p< .001). thirty patients received ceftazidime and 10 patients received imipenem as  the beta-lactam component of the initial empirical treatment. all strains of p. aeruginosa were susceptible to both agents. forty-seven percent of streptococcal  strains were penicillin resistant and showed a decreased susceptibility to ceftazidime (minimum inhibitory concentration ranged from 1 to 64 microg/ml). five patients (12.5%) were considered to have received inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy. attributable mortality in patients with bacteremic pneumonia  was higher than in patients with bacteremia from other sources; 22 (55%) of the 40 patients with bacteremic pneumonia died, whereas 39 (10.6%) of the 368 patients with bacteremia from other sources died (p<.001). conclusions: our data  suggest that bacteremic pneumonia in neutropenic cancer patients is associated with a poor outcome and that empirical antibiotic therapy for neutropenic patients with pneumonia should include agents active against both p. aeruginosa and cephalosporin-resistant streptococci.

TI  == molecular evolution of rifampicin resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == rifampicin resistance has arisen in several different species of bacteria because of alterations to one or more regions in the target of the antibiotic, the beta-subunit of rna polymerase encoded by rpob. nucleotide sequence analysis of a 270 bp fragment of rpob from 16 clinical rifampicin-susceptible isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, 8 clinical rifampicin-resistant isolates, and 3 spontaneous rifampicin-resistant mutants, has revealed that, as with previously examined species, point mutations within the cluster i region of rpob, at sites encoding asp516 and his526, also confer resistance to rifampicin in this important human pathogen. moreover, the residues within cluster i, that were altered within the rifampicin-resistant mutants of s. pneumoniae, were in the same position as those previously found to alter in resistant isolates of escherichia coli and mycobacterium tuberculosis. sequence analysis of rpob, both  from these isolates of s. pneumoniae and from two strains of s. mitis, reveals that, among a number of clinical isolates, resistance to rifampicin in s. pneumoniae has arisen by point mutation. however, the nucleotide sequence of rpob from one isolate examined suggests that interspecies gene transfer may also have  played a role in the evolution of rifampicin-resistance in s. pneumoniae.

TI  == evaluation of swirling, ph, and glucose tests for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: although infrequent, episodes of transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis may lead to serious outcomes or death and therefore are of concern. this study evaluates the sensitivity of three surrogate tests for the presence of bacteria in platelet concentrates: cessation of swirling, low extracellular ph, and low plasma glucose levels. study design and methods: day 0 platelet concentrates were inoculated with low levels of one of seven bacterial strains and stored with agitation at 20 to 24 degrees c for up to 5 days. in the morning  and afternoon of each day of storage, bacterial levels were ascertained by quantitative plate culture, and platelet concentrates were tested for platelet ph, plasma glucose, and swirling. quantitative and semiquantitative dipstick techniques were used to determine ph and glucose levels. results: platelet concentrates had attained stationary phase growth of streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus mitis, or staphylococcus epidermidis (> or = 10(7) -10(8) colony-forming units [cfu]/ml) before either the swirling or dipstick methods suggested the presence of bacteria. the sensitivity of swirling and glucose tests for detecting bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates was generally comparable. although the sensitivity of the ph test was generally similar to that of swirling and glucose tests for most bacteria, platelet concentrates contaminated with e. cloacae had normal ph despite the presence of high levels of bacteria (> or = 10(7)-10(8) cfu/ml). conclusion: the sensitivity in detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates by the swirling technique or by measuring extracellular ph or plasma glucose is less than the sensitivity reported for microscopy with gram stain (10(5)-10(6) cfu/ml), fluorescence microscopy with acridine orange stain (10(4)-10(5) cfu/ml), chemiluminescence detection of ribosomal rna (10(3)-10(4) cfu/ml), and automated bacterial culture (1 cfu/sample volume).

TI  == disruption of the gene encoding penicillin-binding protein 2b (pbp2b) causes altered cell morphology and cease in exopolysaccharide production in streptococcus thermophilus sfi6.
AB  == genetic and biochemical analysis of exopolysaccharide (eps) production in lactic  acid bacteria has been a growing field of interest in the food industry. we previously identified and characterized a gene cluster composed of 13 genes (epsa to epsm) responsible for eps production in streptococcus thermophilus sfi6. here  we report one further gene, pbp2b, that is connected to eps production. mutants with a gene disruption in pbp2b were no longer able to produce eps, exhibited a reduced growth-rate, and their cell morphology was altered. the predicted gene product showed significant homology to the class b penicillin-binding proteins 2b of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis involved in peptidoglycan synthesis. upstream of pbp2b, we further identified two genes which showed significant homology to the e. coli fold and urfl, which is an unidentified open reading frame presumed to be involved in dna repair. downstream of pbp2b, we identified a gene that showed homology to the bacillus subtilis and  the escherichia coli recm or recr which, respectively, are involved in the methyl-dependent dna mismatch repair. in s. thermophilus, pbp2b and recm were transcribed from their own promoters as monocistronic mrnas and are therefore organized as independent transcriptional units.

TI  == homeologous recombination and mismatch repair during transformation in streptococcus pneumoniae: saturation of the hex mismatch repair system.
AB  == the ability of the hex generalized mismatch repair system to prevent recombination between partially divergent (also called homeologous) sequences during transformation in streptococcus pneumoniae was investigated. by using as donor in transformation cloned fragments 1.7-17.5% divergent in dna sequence from the recipient, it was observed that the hex system prevents chromosomal integration of the least and the most divergent fragments but frequently fails to do so for other fragments. in the latter case, the hex system becomes saturated (inhibited) due to an excess of mismatches: it is unable to repair a single mismatch located elsewhere on the chromosome. further investigation with chromosomal donor dna, carrying only one genetically marked divergent region, revealed that a single divergent fragment can lead to saturation of the hex system. increase in cellular concentration of either hexa, the muts homologue that binds mismatches, or hexb, the mutl homologue for which the essential role in repair as yet remains obscure, was shown to restore repair ability in previously saturating conditions. investigation of heterospecific transformation  by chromosomal dna from two related streptococcal species, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis, also revealed complete saturation of the hex system. therefore the hex system is not a barrier to interspecies recombination in s. pneumoniae. these results are discussed in light of those described for the mut system of escherichia coli.

TI  == antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  == in addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. this investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol,  super eba and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli b and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella (bacteroides) intermedia, prevotella (bacteroides) melaninogenica, fusobacterium  necrophorum, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. after growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials  were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees c. impregnated discs with the super eba liquid were used as positive controls. the antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials.  impregnated discs with super eba liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. zinc  oxide-eugenol and super eba pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the effect of indigenous bacterial populations on buccal epithelial cells on subsequent microbial adhesion in vitro.
AB  == despite the numerous investigations on the adhesion of microorganisms to buccal epithelial cells, it is difficult to correlate different results, as disparate adherence values have been reported for a given organism. as one reason for this  disparity may be the indigenous or natural bacterial populations on human buccal  epithelial cells, the effect of the latter on subsequent microbial adherence in vitro was examined. there was a highly significant correlation between the degree of natural bacterial colonization on pooled buccal epithelial cells from 8 healthy donors and the adhesion of a single isolate each of streptococcus mitis,  escherichia coli and actinomyces naeslundii. however, no such relationship could  be established for candida albicans, streptococcus milleri and another isolate of streptococcus mitis. as in previous studies, variation in adherence values was found, both between samples from different donors, and from the same donor over time, but to a far lesser degree in pooled samples from different donors. these results imply that natural bacterial populations on buccal epithelial cells may affect the adhesion values derived from laboratory experimentation, and hence such data should be interpreted with caution.

AB  == this study evaluated restriction fragment length polymorphisms of rrna genes (ribotyping) for genotypic identification of 53 oral isolates classified as "streptococcus sanguis" by colony morphology. isolates were from 8-h buccal plaque on lower first permanent molars of 20 subjects. dna was digested with aatii and hybridized with digoxygenin-labeled cdna of escherichia coli 16s and 23s rrna. strains were ribotyped again with alwni or pvuii on the basis of the presence or absence of a 2,290-bp aatii band. band patterns were compared with reference ribotypes for streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus crista, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus parasanguis strains. forty-eight isolates could be assigned to a species (22 s. sanguis, 14 s. oralis, 12 s. gordonii). multiple species were seen in 14 subjects; multiple strains of the same species occurred in 11 subjects. our findings suggest that ribotyping can be used for genotypic identification of s. sanguis, s. oralis, and s. gordonii isolates.

TI  == species identification of oral viridans streptococci by restriction fragment polymorphism analysis of rrna genes.
AB  == oral streptococci formerly classified as streptococcus sanguis have been divided  into six genetic groups. methods to identify those species by genotype are needed. this study compared restriction fragment polymorphisms of rrna genes (ribotypes) for seven s. gordonii, three s. sanguis, four s. oralis, three s. mitis, one s. crista, and seven s. parasanguis strains classified in previous dna hybridization studies, as well as one clinical isolate. dna was digested with hindiii, pvuii, hindiii and pvuii combined, ecori, bamhi, aatii, alwni, and draii. dna fragments were hybridized with a digoxigenin-labeled cdna probe obtained by reverse transcription of escherichia coli 16s and 23s rrna. s. oralis, s. mitis, and s. parasanguis all showed an isolated 2,290-bp band in aatii ribotypes that was absent from s. gordonii, s. sanguis, and s. crista. the  last three groups showed species-specific bands with aatii and also with pvuii. s. oralis could be distinguished from s. mitis and s. parasanguis in alwni and draii ribotypes. s. mitis and s. parasanguis could not be distinguished, since they shared multiple bands in pvuii, alwni, and ecori patterns. the clinical isolate in the panel was very similar to s. sanguis by all enzymes used. our findings suggest that ribotyping may be useful for genotypic identification of oral viridans streptococci. initial digests of clinical isolates might be made with aatii, followed by pvuii or alwni. isolates then could be identified by comparing ribotype patterns with those of reference strains. this approach could  facilitate clinical studies of these newly defined species.

TI  == postsepsis bradycardia in children with leukemia.
AB  == objective: we observed sinus bradycardia in a small number of children with hematologic malignancies who were recovering from sepsis. our objective was to define this symptom complex and attempt to delineate its etiology. design: retrospective chart review. setting: a pediatric icu in a children's oncology hospital. patients: children admitted to the icu over a 24-month period who developed persistent bradycardia (heart rate less than 5% for age for greater than 1 hr) after an episode of sepsis. measurements and main results: seven children developed postsepsis bradycardia. six patients had a primary diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia and one patient had acute lymphocytic leukemia. all patients had positive blood cultures (streptococcus mitis, n = 4; escherichia coli, n = 2; and klebsiella pneumoniae, n = 1). all seven children were clinically recovering from sepsis when the bradycardia developed. neither hypotension nor other symptom was associated with the bradycardia. no therapy was given for the bradycardia. echocardiograms and ecgs were normal in all patients,  except for the presence of bradycardia. bradycardia persisted for 24 to 72 hrs. after that time, heart rates slowly increased to the normal range for age. conclusions: we speculate that this syndrome may result from alterations in beta-adrenergic receptor function or an unidentified humoral factor produced by the invading organism or as part of the host's response to sepsis. prior drug therapy or the underlying illness may predispose to this condition, since all the patients had acute leukemia. as the bradycardia was clinically insignificant, invasive therapeutic or diagnostic strategies were not indicated.

AB  == a dna fragment encoding the sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase component of the streptococcus mutans phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sucrose phosphotransferase system has been recovered from a plasmid-based genomic library of strain gs5. the locus, designated scrb, was found to reside within a 2.9-kilobase-pair restriction fragment present on the chimeric molecule pva1343 (7.3 kilobase pairs). minicell analysis of pva1343-directed translation products revealed that  the scrb product synthesized in escherichia coli v1343 was a single peptide of mr 57,000. this polypeptide was reactive with antiserum prepared against s. mutans intracellular invertase, which has been previously shown to have an mr of 43,000  to 48,000. the basis of this difference in mr was not established but may represent a posttranslational proteolytic event which occurred in s. mutans but not in recombinant v1343. sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase purified to homogeneity from v1343 exhibited michaelis constants of 180 mm for sucrose and 0.08 mm for sucrose-6-phosphate. deletion analysis of pva1343 facilitated the assignment of a coding region for the hydrolase within the insert, as well as an orientation for  the transcription of scrb. scrb-defective strains of s. mutans constructed by additive integration of an insertionally inactivated scrb locus exhibited the sucrose sensitivity characteristic of this mutant class. similar loci were detected by dna-dna hybridization in additional strains of s. mutans and two strains of streptococcus cricetus, but not in single strain representatives of s. rattus, s. sobrinus, s. sanguis i and ii, s. salivarius, or s. mitis.

AB  == blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (cfu) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. at intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (hs-glc). forty-six isolates including all those examined of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, s. faecalis, s. milleri, s. mitior, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia sp., enterobacter cloacae, bacterioides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, candida albicans, c. krusei and torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by hs-glc. hs-glc failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus. haemophilus influenzae, corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of s. epidermidis. the growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. no significant difference was found between hs-glc analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. all the yeast isolates were detected by hs-glc after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by hs-glc analysis than by other methods.

TI  == hydrogen peroxide-mediated antagonism against serratia marcescens by streptococcus mitis.
AB  == the alpha-hemolytic streptococcus mitis strain no. 17-1, isolated from the oral cavity of an healthy female adult, antagonized the growth of all 24 test strains  of serratia marcescens examined; furthermore, this strain inhibited the growth of various strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, listeria monocytogenes, and corynebacterium diphtheriae. however, strans of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa proved refractory. the mechanism of microbial antagonism was due to production and release of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic atmospheric conditions, which was neutralized through incorporation of bovine liver catalase into the solid assay medium.

TI  == effect of human saliva on glucose uptake by streptococcus mutans and other oral microorganisms.
AB  == we examined the effects of human whole salivary supernatant and parotid fluid on  glucose uptake by streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. the following three effects of saliva were observed: (i) inhibition of glucose uptake (s. mutans, s. sanguis), (ii) promotion of a transient, rapid (0 to 30 s) burst of glucose uptake (s. mutans, s. sanguis), and (iii) enhancement of glucose uptake (s. mitis, a. viscosus, s. aureus, e. coli). we observed no differences between the effects of whole salivary supernatant and the effects of parotid fluid. heat treatment (80 degrees c, 10 min) of saliva or the addition of dithiothreitol abolished inhibition of glucose uptake. supplementation of saliva  with h(2)o(2) potentiated inhibition of glucose uptake. s. mitis and a. viscosus, which were stimulated by saliva alone, were inhibited by h(2)o(2)-supplemented saliva; 50% inhibition of glucose uptake by s. mutans and s. mitis required ca. 10 mum h(2)o(2) in 50% (vol/vol) saliva. loss of the inhibitory action of saliva  occurred at about 5% (vol/vol) saliva. supplementation of saliva dilutions with scn(-) and h(2)o(2) extended the inhibitory activity to solutions containing ca.  0.2% (vol/vol) saliva. we suggest that the salivary lactoperoxidase-scn(-)-h(2)o(2) system is responsible for the inhibitory activity of saliva reported here. furthermore, we concluded that lactoperoxidase and scn(-) are present in saliva specimens in concentrations that exceed minimal inhibitory levels by factors of ca. 500 and 10 to 20, respectively. the resistance of a. viscosus, s. aureus, and e. coli to the inhibitory potential of  saliva alone was probably due to the production of catalase by these organisms. the resistance of s. mitis may have been due to special effects of saliva on h(2)o(2) accumulation by this organism compared with s. mutans and s. sanguis. the basis of saliva-dependent enhancement of glucose uptake and the basis of promotion of a transient, rapid burst of glucose uptake are unknown. the role of  the salivary lactoperoxidase-scn(-)-h(2)o(2) system in the oral microbial ecosystem is discussed.

TI  == determinants of the developing oral flora in normal newborns.
AB  == the ability of streptococcus species to selectively adhere to the oral epithelial cells of newborns was studied in vitro. on day 1 of life, mucosal cells from normal infants demonstrated selective attraction for the natural distribution of  streptococci that would soon colonize these surfaces. streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis adhered well in vitro to scraped cells from cheek and tongue surfaces. streptococcus mutans, on the other hand, exhibited feeble or no  adherence to cheek or tongue cells. adherence of escherichia coli to oral epithelial cells was also studied. the ability of strains of e. coli to adhere to cheek and tongue cells correlated solely with the presence of cell surface substances, probably pili. these observations, made on infants at the critical moment of their developing flora, strengthen the hypothesis that the ability of bacteria to adhere to surfaces is an important determinant of their ecological place in the oral microflora.

TI  == a peroxidase-mediated, streptococcus mitis-dependent antimicrobial system in saliva.
AB  == h(2)o(2) formation by streptococcus mitis was measured by the catalase-dependent  conversion of [(14)c]formate to (14)co(2) ; it was optimal at ph 6.0-6.5 and required glucose. the h(2)o(2) formed by s. mitis could be employed as a component of an antimicrobial system that also included lactoperoxidase (lpo) and either iodide or thiocyanate ions in the concentrations present in saliva. the antimicrobial effect of the lpo-iodide-s. mitis system was measured by the decrease in the viable cell count of the target organisms (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, candida tropicalis). the antimicrobial effect of the lpo-thiocyanate-s. mitis system was measured by the decrease in the rate of growth or the rate of uptake of [(14)c]valine by the target organisms (e. coli, s. aureus). mixed or parotid saliva could replace lpo and thiocyanate ions in the s. mitis-dependent inhibition of bacterial growth and valine uptake. the presence in saliva of a peroxidase-mediated, antimicrobial system dependent on microbial metabolism for h(2)o(2) and its role as a natural host defense mechanism are considered.

TI  == cores, microbial organelles possibly specific to group d streptococci.
AB  == a long, thin, approximately cylindrical core spans the interior of cells of 24-hr cultures of all group d streptococci that were examined, five strains of streptococcus faecalis, single strains of s. faecalis subsp. zymogenes and s. durans, and three strains of streptococcus spp. in one strain of s. faecalis, serial section electron microscopy showed that most cells possess a core. the core is 0.10 to 0.16 mum thick and consists of a matrix and an axial array of ribosomelike particles. it resembles one of two types of cores present in a stable protoplast form of one of the s. faecalis strains. cores were not present  in single strains of s. pyogenes (beta-hemolytic group a), s. agalactiae (group b), s. dysgalactiae (group c), s. equisimilis (group c), and s. mitis (viridans group) that were examined; nor were cores observed in single strains of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and bacillus megaterium. cores may be useful, therefore, in identification of group d streptococci. for preservation and rapid recognition of cores, a glutaraldehyde-osmium tetroxide sequence of fixation appears superior to the osmium tetroxide method often employed in processing bacteria for electron microscopy.

TI  == establishment of human indigenous bacteria in germ-free mice.
AB  == gibbons, r. j. (forsyth dental center and harvard school of dental medicine, boston, mass.), s. s. socransky, and b. kapsimalis. establishment of human indigenous bacteria in germ-free mice. j. bacteriol. 88:1316-1323. 1964.-thirteen strains of bacteria indigenous to the gingival crevice area of man were tested for their ability to establish as monocontaminants in germ-free mice. three facultative organisms, streptococcus mitis, staphylococcus albus, and a "diphtheroid," established, as well as three anaerobes. fusobacterium fusiforme,  an anaerobic diphtheroid, and a bacteroides strain. seven other anaerobes (two strains of b. melaninogenicus, and one strain each of treponema microdentium, veillonella alcalescens, a peptostreptococcus strain, vibrio sputorum, and b. oralis) failed to establish. a mixture consisting of ten organisms representative of the predominant groups of cultivable bacteria present in the gingival crevice  area of man was inoculated intraorally into germ-free mice. all organisms with the exception of b. melaninogenicus and t. microdentium became established as polycontaminants. escherichia coli could be established in the above polycontaminated mice, as well as in those contaminated directly with human gingival debris. e. coli comprised approximately 50 and 6% of the fecal flora in  the two groups, respectively. diet, cecal contents, and feces of germ-free and polycontaminated mice were tested for inhibitory action against t. microdentium and b. melaninogenicus. none inhibited t. microdentium, whereas all three inhibited b. melaninogenicus. the inhibitory effect appeared to be due to dietary alfalfa. b. melaninogenicus could become established in mice monocontaminated with a facultative diptheroid and maintained on an alfalfa-free diet. these experiments indicate that human indigenous bacteria can become established in germ-free mice, and that microbial interactions and diet composition are important determinants.

TI  == normal flora of the nose, throat, and lower intestine of dogs.
AB  == clapper, w. e. (the lovelace foundation for medical education and research, albuquerque, n.m.) and g. h. meade. normal flora of the nose, throat, and lower intestine of dogs. j. bacteriol. 85:643-648. 1963.-an attempt was made to isolate and identify the complete normal flora of the rectum, nose, and throat of beagles. for primary isolation, 12 different kinds of media were used. incubation of blood agar plates and slants anaerobically, and of thioglycolate broth aerobically, allowed the growth of obligate anaerobes. from the rectal specimens, 20 species of bacteria and 10 species of fungi were isolated and identified. the  organisms were similar to those found in the human intestine. escherichia coli, streptococcus mitis, enterococci, s. lactis, bacillus species, and coliforms other than e. coli were most frequently encountered. the frequency of occurrence  was approximately the same at both samplings in more commonly cultured bacteria.  pathogenic e. coli were isolated from nearly one-third of the first specimens. these were the only human pathogens observed. in the throat cultures, 29 species  of bacteria and 2 species of yeasts were identified, and 27 species of bacteria were identified from the nasal cultures. s. mitis, neisseria, and coagulase-negative staphylococcus were most often isolated. the flora was similar to that found in human nose and throat cultures, except that more haemophilus and pneumococcus and fewer coliforms are generally found in human throats. organisms  resembling human pathogens were group a streptococci and coagulase-positive staphylococci. these were isolated infrequently. it appears that this kind of examination would reveal any significant changes in normal flora that might be related to the health of the animal.
