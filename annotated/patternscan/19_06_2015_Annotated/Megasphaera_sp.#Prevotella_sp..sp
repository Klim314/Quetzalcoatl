TI  == analysis of the airway microbiota of healthy individuals and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by t-rflp and clone sequencing.
AB  == chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) is a progressive, inflammatory lung  disease that affects a large number of patients and has significant impact. one hallmark of the disease is the presence of bacteria in the lower airways. objective: the aim of this study was to analyze the detailed structure of microbial communities found in the lungs of healthy individuals and patients with copd. nine copd patients as compared and 9 healthy individuals underwent flexible bronchoscopy and bal was performed. bacterial nucleic acids were subjected to terminal restriction fragment (trf) length polymorphism and clone library analysis. overall, we identified 326 t-rflp band, 159 in patients and 167 in healthy controls. the results of the trf analysis correlated partly with the data obtained from clone sequencing. although the results of the sequencing showed high diversity, the genera prevotella, sphingomonas, pseudomonas, acinetobacter,  fusobacterium, megasphaera, veillonella, staphylococcus, and streptococcus constituted the major part of the core microbiome found in both groups. a trf band possibly representing pseudomonas sp. monoinfection was associated with a reduction of the microbial diversity. non-cultural methods reveal the complexity  of the pulmonary microbiome in healthy individuals and in patients with copd. alterations of the microbiome in pulmonary diseases are correlated with disease.

TI  == microbial community diversity of organically rich cassava sago factory waste waters and their ability to use nitrate and n2o added as external n-sources for enhancing biomethanation and the purification efficiency.
AB  == water shortage necessitated south indian sago factory owners, extracting starch out of cassava tubers, to install biogas plants where a starch utilizing microbial community multiplies and reduces the biological oxygen demand (bod) of  the waste waters by presently about 30%. the purification efficiency of sago factory waste waters, rich in solid particles and having wide c/n ratios, around  250, through unstirred biogas plants needs to be improved. our approach was to apply instead of animal slurry nitrate (no3(-)) and nitrous oxide (n2o) as external n-sources anticipating a better n-distribution in the unstirred biogas plants. estimated cell numbers, bacterial community changes, on the basis of 16s  rrna gene clone libraries and changing co2-, ch4-, n2o releases due to the presence of nitrate or n2o suggest that acid tolerant lactobacillus spp. dominate the biogas plant inflows (ph 3.5). they were very less or not found in the outflows (ph 7.3). assumingly, the phyla bacteroidetes (prevotella spp.), proteobacteria (rhizobium spp., defluvibacter sp.), firmicutes (megasphaera spp., dialister spp., clostridium spp.) and synergistetes (thermanaerovibrio spp.), not-detectable in the biogas plant inflows, replaced them. anaerobes, about 400cellsml(-1) in the inflows, increased to about 10(6)cellsml(-1) in the outflows. the methane formation, as confirmed by the incubation experiments, suggests that methanogens must have been present among the anaerobes. in the biogas plant in- and outflows also about 300cellsml(-1) denitrifying bacteria and up to 10(4)cfu fungi were found. despite the low number of denitrifying bacteria  nitrate added to the biogas plant in- and outflows was widely consumed and added  n2o decreased considerably. thus, wide c/n ratios substrates like sago factory waste waters keep the n2o emissions low by using n2o either as electron acceptor  or by incorporating it into the growing biomass what needs to be confirmed. the biogas plant inflow samples have emitted tentatively more co2 and the outflow samples released more ch4.

TI  == [study of the bacterial community structure of microbiota in bacterial vaginosis  using amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis].
AB  == objective: to study the bacterial community structure of the microbiota in the vaginal fluid from patients with bacterial vaginosis. methods: the composition of bacteria in the samples of vaginal fluid from 3 patients with bacterial vaginosis and 1 normal premenopausal control was investigated by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis(ardra). results: lactobacillus species were the predominant  bacteria in the woman without bacterial vaginosis. bacterial vaginosis was associated with higher concentrations of a variety of bacterial groups. women with bacterial vaginosis had greater bacterial diversity, with 31 to 37 otus operational taxonomic units detected per sample. the species associated with bacterial vaginosis were leptotrichia, prevotella sp. and megasphaera including several species with no close cultivated relatives. conclusions: women with bacterial vaginosis have complex vaginal infections with many newly recognized species. ardra allows rapid analysis of the diversity of microorganisms in the vagina, and is capable of identifying potentially pathogenic bacteria that can not be identified by general culture.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacteria in asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to use terminal restriction fragment length  polymorphism analysis and the 16s rrna gene clone library to investigate the diversity of the microbiota associated with asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections and to compare the bacterial community structure in these two clinical conditions. samples were taken from asymptomatic endodontic infections associated with chronic periradicular lesions and from symptomatic infections clinically diagnosed as acute abscesses. 16s rrna genes from dna isolated from clinical samples were used to construct clone libraries or were subjected to terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. sequence analysis of 186 clones revealed 42 taxa; 23 (55%) were uncultivated phylotypes, of which seven were unique to endodontic infections. clone sequencing and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed that the most commonly detected taxa were fusobacterium nucleatum (including terminal restriction fragment types 1 and 2), peptostreptococcus micros/peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone aj062/bs044/fg014, prevotella species, dialister species, mogibacterium species, lachnospiraceae oral clone 55a-34, filifactor alocis, megasphaera sp. oral clone cs025/bs073, and veillonella sp. oral clone bp1-85/veillonella dispar/v. parvula. bacteroides-like sp. oral clone x083/bacteroidales oral clone mce7_20 and dialister sp. oral clone bs016/mce7_134 were detected only in asymptomatic teeth. on the other hand, f. nucleatum terminal restriction fragment type 2, prevotella intermedia, dialister pneumosintes, and some phylotypes were exclusively detected in symptomatic samples. bacterial profiles of symptomatic endodontic infections generated by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis were clearly different from those of asymptomatic infections. overall, the average number of terminal restriction fragments in symptomatic samples was significantly larger than in asymptomatic samples. molecular analysis of the microbiota associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic endodontic infections indicates that the endodontic bacterial diversity is greater than previously described by culture methods and that the structure of the microbiota differ significantly between asymptomatic and symptomatic infections.
