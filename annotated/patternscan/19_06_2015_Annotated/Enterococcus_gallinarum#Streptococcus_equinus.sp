TI  == immunomodulatory properties of streptococcus and veillonella isolates from the human small intestine microbiota.
AB  == the human small intestine is a key site for interactions between the intestinal microbiota and the mucosal immune system. here we investigated the immunomodulatory properties of representative species of commonly dominant small-intestinal microbial communities, including six streptococcal strains (four streptococcus salivarius, one s. equinus, one s. parasanguinis) one veillonella parvula strain, one enterococcus gallinarum strain, and lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1 as a bench mark strain on human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. the different streptococci induced varying levels of the cytokines il-8, tnf-alpha, and il-12p70, while the v. parvula strain showed a strong capacity to induce il-6. e. gallinarum strain was a potent inducer of cytokines and tlr2/6 signalling. as streptococcus and veillonella can potentially interact metabolically and frequently co-occur in ecosystems, immunomodulation by pair-wise combinations of strains were also tested for their combined immunomodulatory properties. strain combinations induced cytokine responses in dendritic cells that differed from what might be expected on the basis of the results obtained with the individual strains. a combination of (some) streptococci with veillonella appeared to negate il-12p70 production, while augmenting il-8, il-6, il-10, and tnf-alpha responses. this suggests that immunomodulation data obtained in vitro with individual strains are unlikely to adequately represent immune responses to mixtures of gut microbiota communities in vivo. nevertheless, analysing the immune responses of strains representing the dominant species in the intestine may help to identify immunomodulatory mechanisms that influence immune homeostasis.

TI  == cholesterol assimilation by lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria isolated from the human gut.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of human gut-derived lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria on cholesterol levels in vitro. continuous cultures inoculated with fecal material from healthy human volunteers  with media supplemented with cholesterol and bile acids were used to enrich for potential cholesterol assimilators among the indigenous bacterial populations. seven potential probiotics were found: lactobacillus fermentum strains f53 and kc5b, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, streptococcus bovis atcc 43143, enterococcus durans dsm 20633, enterococcus gallinarum, and enterococcus faecalis. a comparative evaluation regarding the in vitro cholesterol reduction abilities of these strains along with commercial probiotics was undertaken. the degree of acid and bile tolerance of strains was also evaluated. the human isolate l. fermentum kc5b was able to maintain viability for 2 h at ph 2 and to grow in a medium with 4,000 mg of bile acids per liter. this strain was also able to remove a maximum of 14.8 mg of cholesterol per g (dry weight) of cells from the culture medium and therefore was regarded as a candidate probiotic.

TI  == [the effect of culture media on bacteriocin production in various strains of bacteria].
AB  == some staphylococcus and enterococcus strains were used to investigate the effect  of culture medium on bacteriocin production. staphylococcus cohnii sc7, staphylococcus sp. ztj 151, s. saprophyticus ss 877, enterococcus faecium ef1 and e. faecalis efg2 were isolated from the rumen wall and contents of lambs, calves  and fallow deer, enterococcus gallinarum eg10 and e. avium ea12 were isolated from the caecum of japanese quail. the tested bacteria belong to producers with a wide antimicrobial effectiveness spectrum, they have low to medium adherence and  urease activity (tab. iii). these culture media were used to test the effect of culture medium on bacteriocin production: nutrient agar no. 2 and vl agar enriched with 2% of glucose and lactose (zag, zal, vlg, vll), agar for isolation  of faecal streptococci (sa) and the base for blood agar no. 4 and no. 2 (ka4, ka2). the strains streptococcus bovis ao 24/85 and staphylococcus aureus oxford 209 p were used as indicator bacteria. tables i and ii show the results of these  tests. the tested strains produced the widest inhibition zones (6 mm) with both indicators on sa medium, and this indicates massive bacteriocin production. on zag medium, the zones of enterococci with the ao 24/85 strain were larger size than those of staphylococci, but the zones were dim. all strains with the 209p indicator produced dim zones of the 2mm size. the larger inhibition zones (2-5mm) in comparison with staphylococci were observed in enterococci on the zal medium with the ao24/85 strain. the production of tested strains was balanced on vlg agar with respect to the use of both indicators.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == numerical taxonomy of streptococcus.
AB  == a numerical taxonomic study of strains of streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. the major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (s. faecalis, s. faecium, 's. avium' and a proposed new species 's. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (s. bovis, s. equinus, s. salivarius, 's. casseliflavus', s. mutans, s. raffinolactis and an unidentified oral group i); (c) lactic species group (s. lactis including s. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (s. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (s. mitis, s. sanguis, a proposed new species 's. oralis' and 's. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. equi, 's. equisimilis' including 's. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of lancefield group b strains of human origin);  (g) parapyogenic species group (s. uberis, 's. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of lancefield groups r, s and t). species of aerococcus, gemella, leuconostoc and pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
