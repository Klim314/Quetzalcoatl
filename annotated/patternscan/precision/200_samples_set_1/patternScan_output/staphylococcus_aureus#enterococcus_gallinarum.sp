TI  == bioprotective potential of bacteriocinogenic enterococcus gallinarum strains isolated from some nigerian fermented foods, and of their bacteriocins.
AB  == enterococcus gallinarum strains isolated from some nigerian fermented foods were  found to produce bacteriocins. the bacteriocins had a broad spectrum of activity  against both gram-positive and negative bacteria. the effects of the bacteriocins and bacteriocinogenic organ- isms on staphylococcus aureus infections in rats were evaluated. sprague-dawley rats were infected with s. aureus mtcc 737 and treated with e. gallinarum t71 and different concentrations of the bacteriocins from e. gallinarum w211 and t71. staphylococcus aureus infection caused significant upregulation of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels in sera of the infected rats. moreover, gelatin zymography revealed that infected gastric tissues showed elevated matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity. bacteriocin treatments reduced the mmp-9 activity and inhibited the expressions of both tumour necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (il-1beta) dose dependently, pointing to a potential role  of the bacteriocins in attenuating inflammatory responses to staphylococcus aureus infec- tion. gastric and git damage caused by staphylococcal infection were reduced in the enterococcus gallinarum t71 and bacteriocin-treated groups also dose dependently. we conclude that these bacteriocins may have useful biomedical applications.
