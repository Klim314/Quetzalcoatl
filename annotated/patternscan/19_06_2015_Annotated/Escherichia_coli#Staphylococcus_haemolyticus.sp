TI  == can apoptosis and necrosis coexist in ejaculated human spermatozoa during in vitro semen bacterial infection?
AB  == purpose: to evaluate whether ejaculated human spermatozoa undergo complete apoptosis or necrosis during experimental semen bacterial infection in vitro. methods: apoptotic markers, including mitochondrial transmembrane potential (deltapsim), phosphatidylserine (ps) externalization, and dna fragmentation, have been detected simultaneously in ejaculated human sperm after their incubation with a known pathogenic (escherichia coli), as well as with conditionally pathogenic bacterial strains (staphylococcus haemolyticus, bacteroides ureolyticus) and/or leukocytes. the deltapsim and translocation of ps was evaluated using the jc-1 and annexin v binding tests, respectively. a modified tunel assay with additional staining for sperm viability was used to detect the dna fragmentation level. results: the exposure of ejaculated spermatozoa to bacterial strains was associated with a simultaneous decrease in the percentage of sperm with normal deltapsim and an increase in the proportion of annexin v-positive sperm. additionally, in the presence of s. haemolyticus, b. ureolyticus and/or leukocytes, a significant increase in the percentage of live tunel-positive (apoptotic) as well as dead tunel-positive (necrotic) sperm cells  was also observed. conclusions: the cellular death observed in spermatozoa in the presence of inflammatory mediators may be due to both apoptosis and necrosis. here, we demonstrate for the first time that direct contact of conditionally pathogenic bacteria with ejaculated human sperm may play an even greater role in  the promotion of apoptosis than in case of some pathogenic bacterial strains. these findings suggest that significant bacteriospermia and leukocytospermia may  be direct causes of subfertility or additional negative factors worsening the prognosis of fertility in natural and assisted procreation.

TI  == drug resistance and molecular epidemiology of aerobic bacteria isolated from puerperal infections in bangladesh.
AB  == puerperal infection is a common complication during postnatal period in developing countries. bacterial species, drug resistance, and genetic characteristics were investigated for a total of 470 isolates from puerperal infections in bangladesh for a 2-year period (2010-2012). the most common species was escherichia coli (n=98), followed by enterococcus faecalis (n=54), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=33), proteus mirabilis (n=32), staphylococcus aureus (n=27), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=22), and enterobacter cloacae (n=21). s.  aureus and acinetobacter baumannii were isolated at a higher frequency from wound infections after cesarean section, while e. coli, e. cloacae, and k. pneumoniae were isolated from community-acquired endometritis and urinary tract infections.  resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was frequent for enterobacteriacae, and was mainly mediated by blactx-m-1 group beta-lactamases. the ctx-m gene in e. coli from the four phylogroups was identified as blactx-m-15, and phylogroup b2 isolates with blactx-m-15 were classified into st131 with o25b allele, harboring  aac(6')-ib-cr and various virulence factors. carbapenemase genes blandm-1 and blandm-7 were identified in one isolate each of phylogroup a e. coli. methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates had type iv or v sccmec, including isolates of st361 (cc672), which is related to an emerging st672 clone in the indian subcontinent. this study revealed the recent epidemiological status of aerobic bacteria causing puerperal infections in bangladesh, providing useful information to improve clinical practice and infection control.

TI  == reduction of teat skin mastitis pathogen loads: differences between strains, dips, and contact times.
AB  == the purpose of these experiments was to (1) assess differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to teat disinfectants (teat dips), and (2) determine the optimum time for premilking teat dips to remain in contact with teat skin to reduce pathogen loads on teat skin. two experiments were conducted using the excised teat model. in experiment 1, the differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to 4 commercially available dips (dip a: 1% h2o2; dip b: 1% chlorine dioxide; dip c: 1% iodophor; and dip d: 0.5% iodophor) were evaluated. four strains of 11 common mastitis pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, mycoplasma bovis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus hyicus, staphylococcus xylosus, and staphylococcus haemolyticus) were tested. in experiment 2, the percentage log reduction of mastitis pathogens (escherichia coli, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, klebsiella species, staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus xylosus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) on teat skin with 3 commercially available teat dips: dip a; dip d;  and dip e: 0.25% iodophor, using dip contact times of 15, 30, and 45 s, was evaluated. experiment 1 results indicated significant differences in strain sensitivities to dips within pathogen species: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus chromogenes, and streptococcus uberis. species differences were also found where mycoplasma bovis (97.9% log reduction) was the most sensitive to tested teat dips and staphylococcus haemolyticus (71.4% log reduction) the most resistant. experiment 2 results indicated that contact times of 30 and 45 s were  equally effective in reducing recovered bacteria for dips d and e and were also significantly more effective than a 15-s contact time. no differences were seen in recovered bacteria between tested contact times after treatment with dip a. it can be concluded that different mastitis pathogen species and strains within species may possess different sensitivities to teat dips, which may have implications in selection of teat dips on dairies. furthermore, a 30-s premilking dip contact time for iodophors and 15 s for h2o2 dips may be optimal in reducing  pathogen load in the shortest amount of time. a reduction in premilking teat dip  contact time may improve milking parlor efficiency.

TI  == characteristic and functional analysis of a ficolin-like protein from the oyster  crassostrea hongkongensis.
AB  == ficolins are a group of soluble animal proteins with multiple roles in innate immunity. these proteins recognize and bind carbohydrates in pathogens and activate the complement system, leading to opsonization, leukocyte activation, and direct pathogen killing, which have been reported in many animal species but  might not be present in the shellfish lineage. in the present study, we identified the first fibrinogen-related protein from the oyster, crassostrea hongkongensis. this novel ficolin-like protein contains a typical signal peptide  and a fibrinogen-related domain (designated chfcn) at the n and c termini, respectively, but does not contain the additional collagen-like domain of ficolins. the full-length cdna of chfcn is 1105 bp, encoding a putative protein of 297 amino acids with the molecular weight of 35.5 kd. chfcn is ubiquitously expressed in selected tissues, with the highest expression level observed in the  gills. the temporal expression of chfcn following microbe infection shows that the expression of chfcn in hemocytes increases at 3 h post-challenge. the chfcn protein expression was also examined, and fluorescence microscopy revealed that dechfcn (truncated signal peptide) is located in the cytoplasm of hela cells. full-length chfcn was detected in the medium supernatant by western blot analysis. recombinant chfcn proteins with the molecular weight about 50 kd bind saccharomyces cerevisiae, staphylococcus haemolyticus or escherichia coli k-12, but not those from vibrio alginolyticus. furthermore, the rchfcn protein could agglutinate gram-negative bacteria e. coli k-12 and enhance the phagocytosis of c. hongkongensis hemocytes in vitro. these results indicate that chfcn might play an important role in the immunity response of oysters.

TI  == fertilizing potential of ejaculated human spermatozoa during in vitro semen bacterial infection.
AB  == objective: to assess the in vitro effect of three bacterial isolates (escherichia coli, serotype o75:hnt, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and bacteroides ureolyticus) and/or leukocytes on sperm motility, subcellular changes in sperm plasma membranes, and sperm fertilizing potential. design: an in vitro model of semen bacterial infection. setting: basic research laboratory. patient(s): healthy normozoospermic volunteers and healthy blood donors. intervention(s): none. main  outcome measure(s): sperm plasma membrane stability was evaluated with a live/dead sperm viability kit and with the merocyanine 540 (m540) test both performed using flow cytometry. an oxiselect tbars assay kit was used for quantitative measurement of malondialdehyde content. functional ability of spermatozoa was assessed by hypo-osmotic swelling (hos) test and sperm penetration assay (spa). result(s): the incubation of sperm with bacteria and/or  leukocytes was associated with the reduction of their fertilizing potential demonstrated in both the hos test and spa, and this effect can be considered as a natural consequence of diminished motility and sperm membrane injury of lipid bilayers. bacteroides ureolyticus demonstrated the most significant detrimental effect on sperm structure and function. conclusion(s): sperm motility and lipid sperm membrane status might be the earliest and the most sensitive indicators of  sperm damage with negative consequences for male factor fertility, which can be attributed to both bacteria and leukocytes action.

TI  == bacteria detected after instrumentation surgery for pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis in a canine model.
AB  == objective: this study was designed to identify the presence, type and origin of bacteria adjacent to the metal implant in the infected region in a canine model of pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis treated with single-stage anterior autogenous bone grafting and instrumentation. methods: dogs with pyogenic spondylodiscitis underwent one-stage debridement, autogenous bone grafting and titanium plate instrumentation and perioperative antibiotic therapy. the implants and adjacent vertebral bones were removed surgically at various postoperative time points (4,  8, 12 and 24 weeks) for bacteria detection. bacteria were detected from retrieved spinal implants as well as surrounding bones by culture and/or pyrosequencing methods in 17 (85%) of all 20 animals. the positive rate for bacteria presence was 45% by culture and 80% by pyrosequencing method. results: radiological or macroscopic examination showed no signs for infection recurrence in any animal regardless of bacteria presence at the surgical site. however, organism identical with the causative bacterium for spinal infection was found in only two of nine culture-positive animals. conclusion: within the confines of the study, the use of metallic implants in an infected area did not lead to a clinically relevant infection although bacteria may exist at the surgical site. the use of metallic implants in an infected area of the spine is safe. the metallic implants may not  be the "culprit" for the persistence or recurrence of infection.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == in vitro efficacy of various topical antimicrobial agents in different time periods from contamination to application against 6 multidrug-resistant bacterial strains isolated from burn patients.
AB  == aim: in vitro efficacy evaluation of eleven topical antimicrobials against multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacteria isolated from burn wounds of our patients. material and methods: growth of six mdr bacterial strains: pseudomonas aeruginosa (2 strains), staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, enterococcus faecalis and escherichia coli in burn-wound models was evaluated 24-h after application of the tested agents. four different wound models were created to investigate the role of time elapsed between inoculation of bacteria and application of the agents on their antimicrobial activity and efficacy. results:  the efficacy against all the 6 bacteria in freshly contaminated wounds was excellent in majority of the tested agents. the longer was the time interval between inoculation and application of the topical antimicrobial agents, the higher failure of the agents was observed. conclusions: topical antimicrobials play an important role in treatment of burn wounds, but they should be used according to their efficacy against bacterial strains present in patients' wounds. in cases where topical agents have been applied after 24 h, when formation of mature biofilm in the wound could be expected, it would probably not be possible to kill all the bacteria using topical antimicrobial therapy only.

TI  == r-thanatin inhibits growth and biofilm formation of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis in vivo and in vitro.
AB  == staphylococcus epidermidis is one of the most frequent causes of device-associated infections, because it is known to cause biofilms that grow on  catheters or other surgical implants. the persistent increasing resistance of s.  epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) has driven the need for newer antibacterial agents with innovative therapeutic strategies. thanatin is reported to display potent antibiotic activities, especially against extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli. the present study aimed to investigate whether a shorter derivative peptide (r-thanatin) could be used as a novel antibacterial agent. we found that r-thanatin was highly potent in vitro against coagulase-negative staphylococci, such as s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, and s. hominis, and inhibited biofilm formation at subinhibitory concentrations. properties of little toxicity to human red blood cells (hrbcs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, a low incidence of resistance, and relatively high stability in plasma were confirmed. excellent in vivo protective  effects were also observed using a methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis (mrse)-induced urinary tract infection rat model. electron microscopy and confocal laser-scanning microscopy analyses suggested that r-thanatin disturbed cell division of mrse severely, which might be the reason for inhibition of mrse  growth. these findings indicate that r-thanatin is active against the growth and  biofilm formation of mrse in vitro and in vivo. r-thanatin might be considered as a specific drug candidate for treating cons infections.

TI  == crystal structure of the ligand-binding form of nanornase from bacteroides fragilis, a member of the dhh/dhha1 phosphoesterase family of proteins.
AB  == nanornase (nrn) specifically degrades nucleoside 3',5'-bisphosphate and the very  short rna, nanorna, during the final step of mrna degradation. the crystal structure of nrn in complex with a reaction product gmp was determined. the overall structure consists of two domains that are interconnected by a flexible loop and form a cleft. two mn(2)(+) ions are coordinated by conserved residues in the dhh motif of the n-terminal domain. gmp binds near the dhha1 motif region in  the c-terminal domain. our structure enables us to predict the substrate-bound form of nrn as well as other dhh/dhha1 phosphoesterase family proteins.

TI  == [frequency distribution and antibiotic resistance of pathogens from the cerebrospinal fluid of 116 children with bacterial meningitis].
AB  == objective: to determine the frequency distribution and antibiotic resistance of pathogens isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid samples of children with bacterial meningitis (bm) and to provide a basis for the timely and effective treatment of childhood bm. methods: retrospective analysis was performed on pathogens isolated from 5097 cerebrospinal fluid samples collected from children  in kunming children's hospital between january 2008 and june 2012, as well as drug sensitivity test results. kirby-bauer antibiotic testing was used to analyze the sensitivity of these pathogens to commonly used antibiotics. results: a total of 116 pathogen strains were detected from the 5097 cerebrospinal fluid samples,  including 77 (66.4%) gram-positive strains, 30 (25.9%) gram-negative strains, and 9 (7.8%) fungal strains, with a positive rate of 2.28%. the six most frequently isolated pathogens were staphylococcus epidermidis (32 strains, 27.6%), streptococcus pneumoniae (15 strains, 12.9%), escherichia coli (15 strains, 12.9%), staphylococcus haemolyticus (9 strains, 7.8%), cryptococcus neoformans (8 strains, 6.9%) and staphylococcus aureus (6 strains, 5.2%). coagulase-negative staphylococci was the predominant pathogen in neonates and young infants with bm, and its sensitivity rates to penicillin, erythromycin and clindamycin were lower  than 40%. streptococcus pneumoniae had a penicillin sensitivity rate of 13.4%, while sensitivity rates to erythromycin and clindamycin reached 60.0%. no staphylococcus and streptococcus pneumoniae pathogens resistant to vancomycin were found. gram-negative bacilli had relatively high sensitivity rates to imipenem, meropenem, cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime. conclusions: gram-positive cocci are the predominant pathogens for childhood bm over the past  five years. the detected pathogens develop high resistance to commonly used antibiotics. to prevent misdiagnosis, careful attention should be paid to bm caused by cryptococcus neoformans.

TI  == hydramacin-1 in action: scrutinizing the barnacle model.
AB  == hydramacin-1 (hm1) from the metazoan hydra exerts antimicrobial activity against  a wide range of bacterial strains. notably, hm1 induces the aggregation of bacterial cells, accompanied by precipitation. to date, the proposed mechanism of peptide-lipid interaction, termed the barnacle model, has not been described on the molecular level. here, we show by biochemical and biophysical techniques that the lipid-peptide interactions of hm1 are initiated by electrostatic and hydrophobic effects, in particular, by tryptophan and neighboring polar amino acid residues that cause an interfacial localization of the peptide between two self-contained lipid bilayers. the high binding constants of hm1 upon lipid interaction are in the range of other potent antimicrobial peptides, e.g., magainin, and can be reasonably explained by two distinct epitopes on the surface of the peptide's global structure, which both contain swt(k/r) motifs. the residues of this motif favor localization of the peptide in the head group region of phospholipid bilayers up to a penetration depth of 4 a and a minor participation of the lipids' hydrocarbon regions. our results expand the knowledge about the molecular modes of action antimicrobial peptides use to tackle their target cells. furthermore, the aggregation of living bacteria by hm1 was observed for a broad range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. therefore, the detailed view of peptide-lipid interactions described by the barnacle model consolidates it among the established models.

TI  == microbiological diagnosis and antibiotic therapy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia and acute copd exacerbation in daily clinical practice: comparison to current guidelines.
AB  == background: the aim of this secondary analysis was to evaluate current microbiological approaches, microbiology, and antibiotic therapy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (cap) and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease (aecopd) in clinical practice and to compare them with current  international guidelines. methods: a total of 362 patients with suspected cap were enrolled in 14 european centers in a prospective multicenter study. results: a total of 279 inpatients (cap, n = 222; aecopd, n = 57) were evaluated. a total  of 83 (37 %) cap patients and 25 (44 %) aecopd patients did not undergo any microbiological tests. in patients with cap/aecopd, blood culture was performed in 109 (49 %)/16 (28.1 %), urinary antigen tests for legionella pneumophila in 67 (30 %)/9 (16 %), and sputum investigation in 55 (25 %)/17 (30 %), respectively. the most frequent pathogens in cap were streptococcus pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumoniae, l. pneumophila, staphylococcus aureus, and enterobacter cloacae; in aecopd they were escherichia coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. all cap patients (mean = 11.1 days) and 35 (61.4 %) of aecopd patients (mean = 8.9 days) received  antibiotics. cap patients were given mostly aminopenicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitors and aecopd patients were given mostly cephalosporins. conclusions: pathogens isolated in cap and aecopd and the antibiotic therapy used are in good  accordance with the guidelines. blood culture, recommended for all cap patients,  was performed in only 50 % of the cases and antibiotic therapy lasted longer than the suggested 5-7 days. therefore, international guidelines regarding performance of blood culture and duration of antibiotic therapy should be adopted more often. this duration was independent of the number of isolated pathogens and number of symptoms on admission. therefore, the question arises as to whether microbiological data are necessary only for patients who are resistant to initial therapy.

TI  == comparative study of nasal bacterial carriage in pediatric patients from two different geographical regions.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial carriage in the anterior nares of two different patient cohorts, aged 5-15 years. by use of a sensitive enrichment broth, gram-positive and -negative bacteria were cultured from the two cohorts of each 100 patients at the referral clinic in eritrea and at a german university hospital. in the german cohort, 27% of the patients were positive either for gram-negative (n=5) or -positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus (n=8; mrsa (n=2)), staphylococcus epidermidis (n=12), corynebacterium spp. (n=4), and streptococcus pyogenes (n=1). in comparison, the  eritrean cohort revealed 33% bacterial carriers in the anterior nares. among the  identified species were s. aureus (n=2), s. epidermidis (n=13), streptococcus haemolyticus (n=9), and gram-negative rods including klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca (n=5), enterobacter agglomerans (n=4), escherichia coli (n=2), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1). noteworthy, none of the eritrean patients were  positive for mrsa. in both cohorts there was no co-occurrence of gram-positive and -negative bacteria in the anterior nares. however, we observed in two subjects of the eritrean cohort co-colonization with s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus. the occurrence of gram-negative bacteria was less significant by age in the german cohort, whereas in the eritrean cohort gram-negative bacteria were more frequently detected in carriers aged 5-9 years. continued surveillance  of s. aureus and gram-negative bacteria carriage deserves further attention and might help to determine future trends in the characteristics of nasal carriage, subsequent incidence of infections, and the potential effectiveness of targeted population based intervention.

TI  == species distribution of coagulase negative staphylococci isolated from different  clinical specimens.
AB  == staphylococci are gram positive, non motile, asporogenous bacteria that characteristically divide in more than one plane to form irregular cluster. species are classified as coagulase-positive staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) are reported to be the third causative agent of nosocomial infections and the most frequent cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections. strains of cons those are resistant to methicillin referred to as methicillin resistant coagulase negative  staphylococci (mrcons). now a days, mrcons has been increasing as a serious nosocomial pathogen having the property of multi drug resistance. the present study was conducted to see the species distribution, antibiotic resistance patterns and some virulence factors of cons isolated from different clinical specimens. this cross sectional descriptive study was carried out in the department of microbiology, mymensingh medical college during the period from july 2009 to may 2011. a total of 300 clinical specimens were collected for this  study of which 240 were found culture positive as single isolate. among them 110  were from surgical wound, 80 from pus of skin infections, 30 from burn ulcer exudates and 20 from diabetic ulcer exudates. a total of 80 strains of cons were  isolated from them. besides cons other isolated bacteria were s. aureus, pseudomonas spp and escherichia coli. the cons were initially detected by coagulase test. all the strains that were either slide or tube coagulase negative were further identified by different biochemical tests using a commercial kit histaph identification kit (himedia laboratories ltd) which comprise a set of 12  standard biochemical tests. a total of 16 species were identified. these were s.  epidermidis, s. saprophyticus, s. caprae, s. haemolyticus, s. simulans, s. xylosus, s. hyicus, s. hominis, s. warneri, s. auricularis, s. lugdunensis, s. felis, s. capitis, s. chromogenes, s. carnosus and s. gallinarum. of them s. epidermidis was the most prevalent (17%) followed by s. saprophyticus (15%), s. caprae (11%), s. haemolyticus (9%).

TI  == chemical synthesis and biological evaluation of an antimicrobial peptide gonococcal growth inhibitor.
AB  == gonococcal growth inhibitor 1 (ggi-1) is a 44-residue peptide with potent anti-legionella activity. it has been isolated from staphylococcus haemolyticus but, to date, its chemical synthesis has not been reported. acquisition of this peptide via this means would enable a more detailed examination of its antimicrobial properties. however, its synthesis represents a significant challenge because of two predicted "difficult sequences" within the peptide. its  successful solid-phase assembly is reported in this paper, and was accomplished by use of simple palliative measures including the introduction of a single pseudo-proline isostere in order to counteract on-resin aggregation. the peptide  had moderate antimicrobial activity against escherichia coli but was inactive against another gram-negative bacterium and two gram-positive bacteria (bacillus  species). it had significant haemolytic activity, with a h(50) (concentration of  peptide that causes 50 % haemolysis) of 20 and 125 mum for two blood samples from different donors. an alternative therapeutic index to that proposed for ggi-1 in  a recent publication is proposed.

TI  == membrane stability and mitochondrial activity of human-ejaculated spermatozoa during in vitro experimental infection with escherichia coli, staphylococcus haemolyticus and bacteroides ureolyticus.
AB  == the aim of the study was to examine an in vitro effect of the three bacterial strains (escherichia coli, staphylococcus haemolyticus and bacteroides ureolyticus) on ejaculated spermatozoa with reference to sperm membrane integrity and mitochondrial activity. the study was carried out on swim-up-separated spermatozoa from 12 normozoospermic volunteers. sperm plasma membrane stability was evaluated by the live/dead sperm viability kit and by the merocyanine 540 test. mitochondrial activity was evaluated using the jc-1 test as well as the nadh-dependent nbt assay. the percentage of dead cells was significantly higher in spermatozoa treated with b. ureolyticus as compared to that of control spermatozoa (p < 0.01). all the bacterial strains applied affected sperm plasma membrane architecture measured by m540 test (p < 0.01). moreover, the presence of e. coli or b. ureolyticus was connected with significant decrease in both the number of cells with high mitochondrial transmembrane potential (deltapsim) and the cells with normal oxidoreductive function of mitochondria (p < 0.05 as compared to untreated cells). to conclude, the contact of bacteria with ejaculated spermatozoa can be a reason for severe injury of sperm membrane stability and mitochondrial activity with potential consequences for male fertility.

TI  == the epidemiological analyses of trauma patients in chongqing teaching hospitals following the wenchuan earthquake.
AB  == background: well-equipped comprehensive hospitals may provide better emergency and patient services for the recovery of injured patients from the earthquake zone. this study aimed to provide an overview of injuries among the patients admitted to the six teaching hospitals in chongqing, china, after the 2008 wenchuan earthquake. materials and methods: the medical records of 533 earthquake victims who were treated and followed-up by the six hospitals were analysed retrospectively. patients' demographic data, diagnosis, microbiological assessment and dispositions were reviewed. results: of the 533 patients, 45.0% patients had an injury severity score (iss) below 8, 41.1% had an iss between 9 and 14 and 13.9% had an iss above 15. the patients were classified based on their fracture sites as follows: head and neck (7.9%), face (1.3%), chest (21.4%), abdomen and pelvis (15.2%), limb and pelvis (58.9%) and body surface (38.5%). of  the 533 patients, 41.6% had a single fracture site, 32.1% had two combined fracture sites and 26.3% had more than three combined fracture sites, while 32 (6.0%) patients suffered from amputation, 3.9% suffered from crush syndrome and 52.7% underwent surgical operations at the hospitals. seventy-nine (14.8%) patients suffered from infections, including 87.3% of pre-hospital infections. the results from bacterial culture and antibiotic susceptibility assays showed that the infectious bacteria mainly involved escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, baumanii, aerobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, c type chain coccus and bacillus aerogenes capsulatus. the sensitivity of various bacterial strains to antibiotics did not exhibit obvious changes, except that the previously multi-drug-resistant hospital bacteria were sensitive to antibiotics. conclusions: for emergency conditions after a catastrophe, comprehensive hospitals must be prepared to meet the massive numbers of severely injured patients. trauma patients from delayed rescue and admission should be given broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as cephalosporin and macrolide antibiotics. the selection of antibiotics in the combination therapy, as described in this study, may greatly enhance the effectiveness of early specific  treatments and prevent severe trauma complications in future natural disasters.

TI  == susceptibility of common aerobic pathogens to tigecycline: results of a surveillance study in germany.
AB  == tigecycline is a novel antimicrobial agent for parenteral use encompassing a broad spectrum of bacterial pathogens, including multi-resistant organisms. here, we report the results of the first nationwide surveillance trial that was conducted in order to evaluate the susceptibility of bacterial isolates to tigecycline in a european country prior to its clinical use. a total of 2,610 gram-positive and gram-negative organisms recovered from hospitalized patients were tested. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined using the microdilution method. all enterococci, staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus; mrsa), and streptococci tested were  tigecycline-susceptible, except one isolate of staphylococcus haemolyticus. among the gram-negative bacteria, 100% of the escherichia coli isolates (including extended spectrum beta-lactamase [esbl]-producers) were tigecycline-susceptible,  while about 10% of the enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were resistant. based on the results of this surveillance study, tigecycline may  represent a suitable option most notably for the empiric treatment of bacterial mixed infections, including in clinical situations in which multi-resistant organisms are suspected.

TI  == a lectin (cflec-2) aggregating staphylococcus haemolyticus from scallop chlamys farreri.
AB  == lectins are a family of carbohydrate-recognition proteins which play crucial roles in innate immunity. in this study, a new lectin (cflec-2) gene was cloned from chlamys farreri by est and race approaches. the full-length cdna of cflec-2  was composed of 708bp, encoding a typical long form carbohydrate-recognition domain of 130 residues. the deduced amino acid sequence showed high similarity to brevican in homo sapiens, c-type lectin-1 and lectin-2 in anguilla japonica. the  cdna fragment encoding the mature peptide of cflec-2 was recombined into plasmid  pet-32a (+) and expressed in escherichia coli rosseta-gami (de3). the recombinant cflec-2 (rcflec-2) protein exhibited aggregative activity toward staphylococcus haemolyticus, and the agglutination could be inhibited by d-mannose but not edta  or d-galactose, indicating that cflec-2 was a ca2+ independent lectin. moreover,  rcflec-2 could suppress the growth of e. coli top10f'. these results suggested that cflec-2 was perhaps involved in the recognition and clearance of bacterial pathogens in scallop.

TI  == bacteria trigger oxygen radical release and sperm lipid peroxidation in in vitro  model of semen inflammation.
AB  == objective: to assess the in vitro effect of five bacterial strains isolated from  semen samples (escherichia coli, staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus oralis, bacteroides ureolyticus, and ureaplasma urealyticum) on reactive oxygen intermediate (roi) release and lipid sperm membrane peroxidation in the coincubated suspensions of white blood cells (wbc) with spermatozoa. design: an in vitro model of semen infection. setting: basic research laboratory. patient(s): healthy normozoospermic volunteers and healthy blood donors. intervention(s): none. main outcome measure(s): chemiluminescent assay was used to evaluate roi generation by wbc. malondialdehyde (mda) concentration was determined in sperm lysates using high-performance liquid chromatography. result(s): of the bacterial strains tested, b. ureolyticus, s. haemolyticus, and  e. coli caused the greatest damage to sperm membrane lipids. an increase in mda levels in sperm lysates was a natural consequence of bacteria-induced roi generation. the wbc usually enhanced harmful activity of the infectious agent toward the cell membranes. conclusion(s): the harmful effect of bacteria on spermatozoa depends on the type and species of microorganisms invading, colonizing, or infecting the male genital tract and is associated with the accompanying oxidative stress. the presence of leukocytes in semen appears to be  the additional factor enhancing the sperm lipid membrane peroxidation, which may  affect the fertility status.

TI  == evaluation of the uro-quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

AB  == aims: to test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. methods: the bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 iu/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin b was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees c with five inocula of 14 bacteria. two yeasts  (candida spp) and one aspergillus were also tested. contaminated media were then  inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened  daily by visual inspection. the sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. results: organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria  irrespective of the starting inoculums: streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, and haemophilus influenzae. for micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal  only (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, candida kruzei, aspergillus  fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (sd 13.8, range 2-52). in cases of detection by the  blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. conclusions: blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.

TI  == nonspecific aerobic vaginitis and pregnancy.
AB  == during the period 1996-1998, cervical swabs of 50 pregnant women with subacute amniotic infection syndrome (ais) and the semen of their consorts were bacteriologically analyzed. in the control group were 50 healthy pregnant women and their consorts too. pathogenic bacteria (the most common were escherichia coli, staphylococcus haemolyticus, chlamydia trachomatis and ureaplasma urealyticum) were isolated from the cervical swab of 50 pregnant patients with ais in 86.0% of them, while in the control group of healthy pregnant women in 28.0%. pathogenic bacteria were present in 70.0% of semen of consorts pregnant women with ais and only in 30.0% of semen of the control group. the congruity of  pathogenic bacteria in the cervical swab and semen in the investigated group was  69.2%, while only 35.7% in the control group. following erythromycin, cefuroxime  and local tetracyclin treatment, the negativization of the cervical swab resulted in 30 pregnant patients with ais, while the colonization persisted in 20 of them. the outcome of pregnancy was significantly better in cases with negativization of the cervical swab: perinatal loss was 6.7%, while in cases with persistent infection it was 55.0%. the authors presume the amniotic infection syndrome should be ascending manifestation of nonspecific vaginitis, which is maintained by the consort's urogenital infection. ais should be classified as a 'sexually-transmitted disease'.

TI  == mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  == 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. the 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. the implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included enterobacter species (enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), klebsiella species (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca), escherichia coli, staphylococcus species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus, serratia marcescens, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus viridans and neisseria meningitidis. six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included e. cloacae in one, a. baumannii in one, k. pneumoniae in one and s. aureus in three. the management of  these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the  high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. however, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.

TI  == staphylococcus haemolyticus lipase: biochemical properties, substrate specificity and gene cloning.
AB  == lipase of staphylococcus haemolyticus l62 was purified from culture supernatant and its molecular mass was estimated to be 45 kda by sds-page. its optimum temperature and ph for the hydrolysis of olive oil was 28 degrees c and ph 8.5, respectively. the enzyme was stable up to 50 degrees c in the presence of ca(2+)and over the ph range 5-11. it had high hydrolytic activity against tributyrin, tripropionin, and trimyristin among various triglycerides. the gene encoding the lipase was cloned in escherichia coli. sequence analysis showed an open reading frame of 2136 bp, which encodes a preproenzyme of 711 amino acids. the preproenzyme is composed of a signal peptide (60 aa), a pro-peptide (259 aa), and a mature enzyme (392 aa). the mature enzyme has 49-67% amino acid sequence homology with other staphylococcal lipases.

TI  == stool microflora in extremely low birthweight infants.
AB  == aim: to serially characterise aerobic and anaerobic stool microflora in extremely low birthweight infants and to correlate colonisation patterns with clinical risk factors. methods: stool specimens from 29 infants of birthweight <1000 g were collected on days 10, 20, and 30 after birth. quantitative aerobic and anaerobic  cultures were performed. results: by day 30, predominant species were enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterbacter  cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus haemolyticus. lactobacillus and bifidobacteria spp were identified in only one infant. in breast milk fed (but not in formula fed) infants, the total number of bacterial species/stool specimen increased significantly with time (2.50 (se 0.34) on day 10; 3.13 (0.38) on day 20; 4.27 (0.45) on day 30) as did quantitative bacterial counts; gram negative species accounted for most of the increase. on day 30, significant inverse correlations were found between days of previous antibiotic treatment and number of bacterial species (r=0.491) and total organisms/g of stool (r=0.482). gestational age, birthweight, maternal antibiotic or steroid treatment, prolonged rupture of the membranes, and mode of delivery did not seem to affect colonisation patterns. conclusions: the gut of extremely low birthweight infants  is colonised by a paucity of bacterial species. breast milking and reduction of antibiotic exposure are critical to increasing fecal microbial diversity.

TI  == [bacterial strains isolated from neutropenic patients and their resistance to antibiotics].
AB  == background: although gram negative as well as gram positive bacteria participate  in febrile episodes of neutropenic patients, in particular recently the ratio of  gram positive bacteria is increasing. the objective of the present work was to investigate the incidence and antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacterial agents in neutropenic patients. methods and results: the presence of bacteria was investigated in 446 neutropenic patients hospitalized at the haematological clinic in 1995. haemocultures (apparatus bact/alert 120, cultivation media organon-teknika) and urine were examined. the sensitivity for antibiotics was tested by the standard dilution micromethod. in blood most frequently staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated (45.4%), coagulase-negative strains of staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus hominis and staphylococcus saprophyticus (14.4%), acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii (complex 6.3%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.3%). in urine the following were detected: staphylococcus epidermidis (36.5%), enterococcus sp. (14.5%), escherichia coli (13.1%), enterococcus faecalis (11.6%) and enterococcus solitarius (6.5%). in all strains resistance to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic drugs was assessed. conclusions: investigation of the frequency of different bacterial species, along with monitoring of the resistance is an essential prerequisite of initial antibiotic therapy of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients.

TI  == bacterial and ureaplasma colonization of the airway: radiologic findings in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  == objective: we designed this retrospective study to compare radiologic findings in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) in whom gram-positive cocci (gpc), gram-negative bacilli (gnb), or ureaplasma urealyticum were colonized. another objective was to correlate the radiologic findings of these patients with the clinical severity of bpd. study design: we correlated serial tracheal aspirates with radiographic findings from 183 infants whose birth weight was < or = 1250 gm. bpd severity was assessed by oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age (36 w pca) and at the time of discharge. two radiologists independently scored films taken at birth and 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days of life. results: of the study population, 55% were male and 35% were black; 80% received surfactant and 69% received dexamethasone; 91% survived. gpc isolates from throat cultures were mainly staphylococcus [corrected] epidermidis and streptococcus haemolyticus. a superimposed gnb colonization was present in 37% of these infants. most common isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and escherichia coli. sepsis caused by gpc developed in 16% of all patients; 7% had sepsis caused by gnb. infants infected with gnb remained receiving oxygen at 36 w pca and at the time of discharge twice as often as those noninfected. radiologic findings: hyperinflation, interstitial changes, and generalized or localized emphysema were prominent features throughout. mean radiologic scores increased over time in a pattern similar among gpc, gnb, and u. urealyticum infected and noninfected infants. high radiologic scores were not predictive at any time of infants who needed supplemental oxygen at 28 days and at 36 w pca. infants infected with u. urealyticum were neither clinically nor radiologically different than noncolonized neonates. conclusion: gpc, gnb, and u. urealyticum airway colonization is not associated with particular radiographic changes at any time. gnb-infected infants had the most severe bpd course, and yet they were radiologically indistinguishable from the other patients. u. urealyticum colonization does not result in more clinically severe bpd or demonstrate a unique radiologic course.

AB  == bacterial adhesion to silver-coated orthopedic external fixation pins was compared with stainless steel controls in an in vitro study. using five bacterial isolates from wound infections, the silver coating was found to reduce adhesion for escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and two strains of staphylococcus aureus while the converse applied for staphylococcus haemolyticus. when placed in human serum, both surfaces were conditioned to a similar extent with serum proteins; this conditioning lead to further reductions in bacterial adhesion, ultimately approaching similar levels for both stainless steel and silver-coated  samples.

TI  == neonatal airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli: association with severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  == background: airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli (gnb) and gram-positive cocci (gpc) is common in mechanically ventilated neonates. whether  gnb are related to nosocomial bloodstream infection (bsi) and/or to the severity  of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) is unknown. methods: we prospectively examine this relationship using a cohort design. data from 260 < or = 1250-g birth weight inborn infants (1991 to 1995) intubated > or = 2 weeks included 917 serial tracheal cultures and 583 blood cultures. the severity of bpd was assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and the use of home oxygen supplementation. results: after 2 weeks of ventilation, 80% of the infants were colonized with gpc (staphylococus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus in 90% of the cases). superimposed on 36% of these infants was gnb airway colonization with klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), enterobacter cloacae (25%), escherichia coli (25%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), serratia marcescen (10%), acinetobacter baumannii and haemophilus influenzae (5%). comparison between 174 gpc- and 86 gnb-colonized infants showed  that demographics, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal risk factors and mortality were similar. fifteen percent of gnb-colonized infants developed bsi caused by gnb and 14% developed bsi caused by gpc. no significant temporal relationship between airway colonization and bsi was noted. gnb infants were ventilated longer and required oxygen at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and home oxygen supplementation twice as often as infants colonized only with gpc. gnb colonization was a predictor of severe bpd after controlling for ventilation. ureaplasma colonization occurred in 28% of gnb-colonized and 33% of noncolonized  infants and was not a predictor of bpd severity. conclusion: gnb airway colonization creates a moderate risk for bsi. antibiotic treatment does not regularly eradicate gnb. gnb airway colonization is associated with severe bpd, but further studies will be necessary before therapeutic efforts to eradicate gnb from the airways should be undertaken.

TI  == [multicenter study of isolated micro-organisms resistant to antimicrobials in 10  portuguese hospitals in 1994].
AB  == in 1994, microbiology laboratories of ten portuguese hospitals analysed isolated  microorganisms found in blood and urine samples and studied antimicrobial susceptibilities of the most frequent bacterial pathogens. from 63780 blood samples, the most frequent were staphylococcus spp. and from 69189 urine samples  significant numbers of escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida spp. were isolated. escherichia coli strains (c.7000) revealed a low percentage of resistance to antibiotics with the exceptions of ampicillin (48%) and co-trimoxazol (25%). klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (c.2000) revealed important resistance to ampicillin (98%), cephalotin (31%), co-trimoxazol (38%) and gentamicin (28%), while values for 3rd generation cephalosporins varied among hospitals, with several strains showing phenotype of  extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. a great variation in resistance values of p. aeruginosa (c.4000) was found in relation to the antibiotics as well as to the hospitals. resistance to methicillin in s. aureus (c.6000) was high, reaching an  average of 47%, and it was even higher with s. epidermidis (c.3000) and s. haemolyticus (c.650). only vancomycin was always active against these strains. in e. faecalis (c.2500) resistance was of 2% to ampicillin, 35% to gentamicin, 45% to streptomycin and 1% to vancomycin. e. faecium isolates (c.300) showed the most worrying results with 70% resistance to ampicillin, 42% to gentamicin, 59% to streptomycin and 9% (30 strains isolated in 5 hospitals) to vancomycin. vancomycin resistant strains were also resistant to all other antibiotics.

TI  == cloning and characterization of a novel, plasmid-encoded trimethoprim-resistant dihydrofolate reductase from staphylococcus haemolyticus mur313.
AB  == in recent years resistance to the antibacterial agent trimethoprim (tmp) has become more widespread, and several trimethoprim-resistant (tmpr) dihydrofolate reductases (dhfrs) have been described from gram-negative bacteria. in staphylococci, only one tmpr dhfr has been described, the type s1 dhfr, which is  encoded by the dfra gene found on transposon tn4003. in order to investigate the  coincidence of high-level tmp resistance and the presence of dfra, we analyzed the dnas from various tmpr staphylococci for the presence of dfra sequences by pcr with primers specific for the thye-dfra genes from tn4003. we found that 30 or 33 isolates highly resistant to tmp (mics, > or = 512 micrograms/ml) contained dfra sequences, whereas among the tmpr (mics, < or = 256 micrograms/ml) and tmps  isolates only the staphylococcus epidermidis isolates (both tmpr and tmps) seemed to contain the dfra gene. furthermore, we have cloned and characterized a novel,  plasmid-encoded tmpr dhfr from staphylococcus haemolyticus mur313. the dfrd gene  of plasmid pabu17 is preceded by two putative shine-dalgarno sequences potentially allowing for the start of translation at two triplets separated by nine nucleotides. the predicted protein of 166 amino acids, designated s2dhfr, encoded by the longer open reading frame was overproduced in escherichia coli, purified, and characterized. the molecular size of the recombinant s2dhfr was determined by ion spray mass spectrometry to be 19,821.2 +/- 2 da, which is in agreement with the theoretical value of 19,822 da. in addition, the recombinant s2dhfr was shown to exhibit dhfr activity and to be highly resistant to tmp.

AB  == sixty-six cultures of staphylococcus spp. were obtained from bone and tissue samples collected from 37 patients during revision arthroplasties and were speciated and ribotyped to assess strain diversity in each species. there were 10 ribotypes among 51 isolates of s. epidermidis, three among three isolates of s. capitis, two among four isolates of s. aureus and two among two isolates of s. simulans. one ribotype was found among each of: two isolates of s. warneri; two isolates of s. haemolyticus and single isolates of s. cohnii and s. saprophyticus. low molecular weight bands of ribotype patterns characterized one  or two related species whereas high molecular weight bands were useful for distinguishing types within species. specimens from 17 patients yielded more than one isolate of staphylococcus spp. in 13 of these patients the isolates were representatives of a single species but in only eight did ribotyping show the isolates to be identical. the findings of multiple species and ribotypes from samples taken from the same patient may have implications for understanding the nature of infection in revision arthroplasty and for antibiotic therapy.

TI  == staphylococcus haemolyticus contains two d-glutamic acid biosynthetic activities, a glutamate racemase and a d-amino acid transaminase.
AB  == two d-glutamic acid biosynthetic activities, glutamate racemase and d-amino acid  transaminase, have been described previously for bacteria. to date, no bacterial  species has been reported to possess both activities. genetic complementation studies using escherichia coli wm335, a d-glutamic acid auxotroph, and cloned chromosomal dna fragments from staphylococcus haemolyticus revealed two distinct  dna fragments containing open reading frames which, when present, allowed growth  on medium without exogenous d-glutamic acid. amino acid sequences of the two open reading frames derived from the dna nucleotide sequences indicated extensive identity with the amino acid sequence of pediococcus pentosaceous glutamate racemase in one case and with that of the d-amino acid transaminase of bacillus spp. in the second case. enzymatic assays of lysates of e. coli wm335 strains containing either the cloned staphylococcal racemase or transminase verified the  identities of these activities. subsequent dna hybridization experiments indicated that staphylococcus aureus, in addition to s. haemolyticus, contained homologous chromosomal dna for each of these genes. these data suggest that s. haemolyticus, and probably s. aureus, contains genes for two d-glutamic acid biosynthetic activities, a glutamate racemase (dga gene) and a d-amino acid transaminase (dat gene).

AB  == two commercially available media recommended for the isolation and rapid identification of escherichia coli from urinary tract infections were supplemented with l-phenylalanine and l-tryptophan. the non-selective medium proved suitable for the direct detection of lactose fermentation, beta-glucuronidase and phenylalanine deaminase activities, indole production and  the oxidase test. it was highly efficient in making a presumptive identification  at species level of the most common gram-negative urinary pathogens, e. coli, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, that account for c. 85% of all urinary isolates. among the gram-positive isolates, most colonies were non-fluorescent and could be separated into staphylococci and enterococci on the  basis of the catalase test. fluorescent colonies were found to be staphylococcus  haemolyticus isolates, 61% of which were fluorescent. the selective medium proved suitable for the same biochemical tests, with the exception of indole, which was  not visible against the red colour of the medium. therefore, the differentiation  of p. mirabilis from other proteus-providencia species was impossible on this medium.

AB  == the clinical efficacy and tolerability of ciprofloxacin orally administered at the dosage of 250 mg twice a day was evaluated in 25 patients affected by acute bacterial pharyngotonsillitis. all patients were non-responders to previous conventional antibiotic therapies due to in vitro resistance of the responsible bacteria, or possibly the low antibiotic concentration at the infection site. none of the patients had infections caused by group a beta-haemolyticus streptococcus. treatment with ciprofloxacin lasted for 5-10 days (mean 6.7). a favorable clinical response was observed in 92% of patients (15 resolutions and 7 improvements) at the end of the therapy and two weeks later (follow-up). one patient was not evaluable because of the unfortunate onset of glossitis that caused the interruption of the treatment. no other side-effects were recorded in  the other 24 patients. the bacteriological response was excellent: 83% bacteriological eradication, 13% persistence and super-infection in only one patient (4%). ciprofloxacin administered orally at low dosages is highly effective in the treatment of bacterial pharyngotonsillitis and is also well tolerated.

TI  == cloning and restriction analysis of dna conferring new quinolone antimicrobial agent resistance from staphylococcus aureus and other coagulase-negative staphylococcus species.
AB  == dna conferring resistance to new quinolone antimicrobial agents (nqr) in clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), s.  epidermidis and s. haemolyticus, was analyzed after cloning in escherichia coli.  the nqr phenotypes were expressed in e. coli at lower levels. nqr gene(s)-carring hindiii fragments were very similar to each other among s. aureus or cns, although the s. aureus fragments differed from the cns fragments in terms of the  nqr phenotypes and restriction endonuclease maps. the data suggest the possibility that the nqr genes have disseminated in evolutionarily distinct routes among s. aureus and cns.

TI  == human choriogonadotropin-like material in bacteria of different species: electron microscopy and immunocytochemical studies with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies.
AB  == immunocytochemical studies using antisera to whole human choriogonadotropin (hcg), to its alpha- and beta-subunits and to the cooh-terminal peptide of hcg beta, and two monoclonal antibodies to hcg beta, demonstrated expression of hcg-like material, its individual subunits and/or fragments in nine bacterial strains. seven of these were isolated from patients with cancer and were definitely identified as streptococcus faecalis (three strains), staphylococcus haemolyticus (two strains) and staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli (single strains). the other two strains were cell-wall-deficient (cwd) variants,  one identified as streptococcus bovis, isolated from the blood of a patient with  a fever of unknown origin and a possible brain abscess. the other was a gram-negative diphtheroid isolated from the urine of a pregnant woman, which during the period of study reverted to a gram-positive corynebacterium identified as a 'c. ulcerans' strain and expressed the hcg-like factor only during its phase as gram-negative diphtheroid. electron microscopy of these nine strains (including negative controls of strains of the same species subjected to the same immunocytochemical analyses and under identical cultural conditions) revealed morphological alterations in the bacterial cell walls and cytoplasmic material and/or bizarre forms of reproduction in six of the nine strains expressing hcg-like material including the two cwd variants. collectively, these results provided evidence that (1) hcg-producing bacteria isolated from patients with overt cancer are not a new and unique species as claimed by others, and (2) there is a close resemblance between the bacterial protein and the human trophoblastic  hormone, based on immunochemical recognition of different parts of the hcg molecule.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == nucleotide sequence of gene lina encoding resistance to lincosamides in staphylococcus haemolyticus.
AB  == we have determined the nucleotide sequence of gene lina in plasmid pip855, which  confers resistance to lincomycin by inactivating it in staphylococcus haemolyticus. the gene was defined by start and stop codons and an open reading frame of 483 bp corresponding to a product with an mr of 19020. the apparent size of the resistance-conferring protein was 21 kda, when a minicell extract was electrophoresed in the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. full expression of lina was obtained both in escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis.

TI  == [determination of resistance and antibiotic therapy in bacterial eye diseases of  childhood].
AB  == from june 1982 to december 1983 children aged between 3 days and 5 years (average 2-1/2 years) with bacterial conjunctivitis, blennorrhea or perforated corneal ulcers were examined microbiologically. the results of 30 antibiotic susceptibility tests were compared with those of adults. prevalence of escherichia coli (6%) and staphylococcus aureus haemolyticus (17%) was observed;  candida species was not found in the young children. pediatric diseases revealed  themselves to be more pronounced in general. the authors diagnosed 3 chlamydial blennorrheas in newborn aged 7, 8 and 10 days. mixed infections were found significantly less often in children (21%) than in adults (64%). the authors point out the need for epidemiologic antibiotic susceptibility studies to facilitate decision making for ad hoc therapeutic measures that are sometimes indicated in endophthalmitis or severe blennorrhea. the possible complications of antibiotic polypragmasia and the use of fixed combinations are discussed.

TI  == plasmid-mediated resistance to lincomycin by inactivation in staphylococcus haemolyticus.
AB  == staphylococcus haemolyticus bm4610 was resistant to high levels of lincomycin and susceptible to macrolides, clindamycin, and streptogramins. this resistance phenotype, not previously reported for a human clinical isolate, was due to inactivation of the antibiotic. the gene conferring resistance to lincomycin in strain bm4610 was carried by a 2.5-kilobase plasmid, pip855, which was cloned in  escherichia coli. plasmid pip855 caused inactivation of both lincomycin and clindamycin in s. haemolyticus and in e. coli but conferred detectable resistance to lincomycin only in s. haemolyticus and to clindamycin only in e. coli.

TI  == microbiological investigations on cryopreserved human semen.
AB  == primary mycological contamination was studied in 565 random human ejaculates. after sperm preservation at low temperature, secondary mycological contamination  of 55 of the ejaculates was investigated. 25 ejaculates were cryopreserved with and without antibiotics and examined bacteriologically before and after different phases of cryopreservation. furthermore, semen samples of several donors were inoculated with suspensions of different concentrations of yeasts and with the test bacteria escherichia coli k 12 and staphylococcus aureus sg 511. microbiological results were then compared before and after cryopreservation. the following results were obtained: 1.9.8% of samples showed primary mycological contamination (1.9% with candida albicans). 2. cryopreservation reduced the concentration of fungi by more than 90% on average. 3. only one semen sample was  contaminated with bacteria (staphylococcus aureus haemolyticus and streptococcus  nonhaemolyticus). non-pathogenic bacteria were found in 11 ejaculates (micrococcus luteus in 5 samples and staphylococcus epidermidis in 6 samples), and contamination was largely unaffected by cryopreservation, even in the presence of antibiotics. 4. test bacteria inoculated into semen were not influenced by the addition of antibiotics to the cryoprotective medium.

TI  == [the antibacterial activity of diphenhydramine (author's transl)].
AB  == diphenhydramine (n,n-dimethyl-2-diphenyl-methoxy-ethylamine) [n,n-dimethyl-2-(diphenylmethoxy)-ethylamin] (dph) is a well-known local anaesthetic and an antagonist of both acetylcholine and histamine. we tested its  antibacterial efficacy by means of three different investigation methods, i.e. microcalorimetry, continuous density measurement and the microdilution test to find out the mic of this compound against various bacteria. dph inhibits the growth of e. coli and klebsiella strains at a concentration of 0.18% of staphylococcus aureus haemolyticus at 0.37%, of pseudomonas aeruginosa at 0.75% and streptococcus faecalis strains at 1.5%. the results of microcalorimetry and continous density measurements showed that the addition of 0.2% dph to a broth with growing bacteria interferes very quickly with cell metabolism and stops further reproduction. the microcalorimetric findings were carried out with staphylococcus aureus haemolyticus strain no. 13,665 an- the e. coli strain no. 3579.

TI  == [comparison of the antibacterial efficacy of doxycycline and tetracycline (author's transl)].
AB  == in order to explain the mechanism of resistance within the tetracycline group, the minimal inhibitory concentration of tetracycline hcl was compared with that of doxycycline in the micro dilution test for bacterial collectives of 48 strains each from the groups of gram-negative and gram-positive cocci, resp. there was no significant difference between the inhibitory effect of doxycycline and tetracycline hcl for the bacterial collectives of e. coli, klebsiella, proteus and staphylococcus aureus heamolyticus strains which were inhibited by a relatively low concentration of tetracycline hcl and doxycycline, respectively. on the other hand a significant difference in inhibitory effect was observed the  calculation was made according to the kolmogoroff-smirnov test for the bacterial  collectives of enterococci and staphylococcus aureus haemolyticus strains which were tetracycline resistant or only inhibited by higher concentrations. these results also have a practical importance, because a further testing against doxycycline can bring about a sensitivity to this substance in case of tetracycline resistant grampositive cocci. possible explanations for the higher efficacy of doxycycline on these bacterial collectives will be discussed.

TI  == antibacterial activity of human cervical mucus.
AB  == the antimicrobial property of human uterine cervical mucus was tested in three groups of women. healthy women, using no contraception, women using an intrauterine device and women receiving hormonal treatment for contraception. cervical mucus was taken on the 10th, 14th, 18th and 22nd day of the menstrual cycle. cervical mucus had a strong inhibitory effect on the growth of micrococcus lysodeicticus in all three groups. the strength of the inhibitory effect on the other microorganisms were in the following order: staphylococcus albus, staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, candida albicans, streptococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus faecalis. use of an intrauterine device did not affect the antimicrobial effect of cervical mucus. the use of hormonal contraceptive canceled the antimicrobial effect on the series of microorganisms,  with the exception of m. lysodeicticus. the maximum inhibitory effect occurred on the 14th day and declined toward the end of the menstrual cycle.
