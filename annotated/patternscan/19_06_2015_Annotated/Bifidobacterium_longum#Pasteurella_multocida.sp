TI  == efficient one-pot multienzyme synthesis of udp-sugars using a promiscuous udp-sugar pyrophosphorylase from bifidobacterium longum (blusp).
AB  == a promiscuous udp-sugar pyrophosphorylase (blusp) was cloned from bifidobacterium longum strain atcc55813 and used efficiently with a pasteurella multocida inorganic pyrophosphatase (pmppa) with or without a monosaccharide 1-kinase for one-pot multienzyme synthesis of udp-galactose, udp-glucose, udp-mannose, and their derivatives. further chemical diversification of a udp-mannose derivative resulted in the formation of udp-n-acetylmannosamine.
