[evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
introduction: antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (snp's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for therapeutic purposes. it is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal snp's possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of snp's against cariogenic bacteria: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis responsible for initiation of dental carries. tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. nanotechnology creates a new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. methods: colloidal silver solution (css) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis and s, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs of 7 patients treated for dental carries at department of conservative dentistry, medical university of warsaw. mic and mbc values for css's were evaluated. results: css used in this research is of good stability. no agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. mic values were: 12-25 ppm for s. salivarius, 25 ppm for s. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for s. mitis and 50 ppm for s. mutans, while mbc values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. after 24 hours of contact mbc values were: 25-50 ppm for s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for s. mitis and 200 ppmfor s. mutans. conclusions: antimicrobial properties of css depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. the susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.
influence of hyaluronic acid on bacterial and fungal species, including clinically relevant opportunistic pathogens.
hyaluronic acid (ha) has several clinical applications (aesthetic surgery, dermatology, orthopaedics and ophtalmology). following recent evidence, suggesting antimicrobial and antiviral properties for ha, we investigated its effects on 15 atcc strains, representative of clinically relevant bacterial and fungal species. the in vitro system employed allowed to assess optical density of broth cultures as a measure of microbial load in a time-dependent manner. the results showed that different microbial species and, sometimes, different strains belonging to the same species, are differently affected by ha. in particular, staphylococci, enterococci, streptococcus mutans, two escherichia coli strains, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida glabrata and c. parapsilosis displayed a ha dose-dependent growth inhibition; no ha effects were detected in e. coli atcc 13768 and c. albicans; s. sanguinis was favoured by the highest ha dose. therefore, the influence of ha on bacteria and fungi warrants further studies aimed at better establishing its relevance in clinical applications.
analytical specificity and sensitivity of a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for identification of bovine mastitis pathogens.
intramammary infection (imi), also known as mastitis, is the most frequently occurring and economically the most important infectious disease in dairy cattle. this study provides a validation of the analytical specificity and sensitivity of a real-time pcr-based assay that identifies 11 major pathogen species or species groups responsible for imi, and a gene coding for staphylococcal beta-lactamase production (penicillin resistance). altogether, 643 culture isolates originating from clinical bovine mastitis, human, and companion animal samples were analyzed using the assay. the isolates represented 83 different species, groups, or families, and originated from 6 countries in europe and north america. the analytical specificity and sensitivity of the assay was 100% in bacterial and beta-lactamase identification across all isolates originating from bovine mastitis (n = 454). when considering the entire culture collection (including also the isolates originating from human and companion animal samples), 4 streptococcus pyogenes, 1 streptococcus salivarius, and 1 streptococcus sanguis strain of human origin were identified as streptococcus uberis, and 3 shigella spp. strains were identified as escherichia coli, decreasing specificity to 99% in strep. uberis and to 99.5% in e. coli. these false-positive results were confirmed by sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. specificity and sensitivity remained at 100% for all other bacterial targets across the entire culture collection. in conclusion, the real-time pcr assay shows excellent analytical accuracy and holds much promise for use in routine bovine imi testing programs. this study provides the basis for evaluating the assay's diagnostic performance against the conventional bacterial culture method in clinical field trials using mastitis milk samples.
lactoferrampin: a novel antimicrobial peptide in the n1-domain of bovine lactoferrin.
the antimicrobial activity of bovine lactoferrin is attributed to lactoferricin,  situated in the n1-domain. based on common features of antimicrobial peptides, a second putative antimicrobial domain was identified in the n1-domain of lactoferrin, designated lactoferrampin. this novel peptide exhibited candidacidal activity, which was substantially higher than the activity of lactoferrin. furthermore, lactoferrampin was active against bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but not against the fermenting bacteria actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis. notably, lactoferrampin is located in the n1-domain in close proximity to lactoferricin, which plays a crucial role in membrane-mediated activities of lactoferrin.
[antibacterial activity of histidine-rich polypeptides in human parotid saliva].
two ultrasensitive antibacterial assays were applied to determine the antibacterial activity of histidine-rich polypeptides (hrps) in human parotid saliva. the results not only confirmed the potent antibacterial activity of hrps against streptococcus mutans mt6r, but also showed for the first time that hrps were effectively antibacterial to staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, escherichia coli ml-35p and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853. among hrps, hrp3, hrp5 and hrp6 were the major antibacterial components which were active against s. mutans, s. aureus, e. coli and p. aeruginosa, whereas hrp1 was only effective against e. coli. s. sanguis was resistant to the action of hrps. these results suggest that hrps are actually a family of endogenous antibiotic peptides with broad antimicrobial spectrum including fungi, gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and may play an important role in the prevention of various infection diseases in the oral cavity as well as in the resistance to caries.
extracts of prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans inhibit alkaline phosphatase activity in osteoblastic cells in vitro.
in order to study the effects of sonicated extracts from prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and other oral-related bacteria, as well as escherichia coli on bone formation, clone mc3t3-e1 cells, which have retained osteoblastic activity, were cultured with various bacterial extracts. the addition of the sonicated extracts from prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans decreased the alkaline phosphatase activity in a dose-dependent fashion over the concentration range of 1-1000 ng ml-1 compared with the control. by contrast, the sonicated extracts from other oral bacteria including porphyromonas gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, streptococcus milleri and streptococcus sanguis, and escherichia coli did not decrease the alkaline phosphatase activity even in the presence of 100 ng ml-1 protein. the addition of prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans extracts that had been treated with heat and trypsin to the cell cultures also inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity in the cells, suggesting that inhibitory factors are not proteinaceous. polymyxin b did not change the alkaline phosphatase activity in the cells treated with the extracts from prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, suggesting that the inhibitory activity of the extracts is not lipopolysaccharide. the inhibitory effect of both extracts was observed in the molecular mass over 290 kda eluted from sephadex g-200 column. the inhibitory substances of prevotella intermedia were partially purified and showed broad band with estimated molecular weight of 170-190 kda by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. these results indicate that prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans may play an important role in inhibiting bone formation as well as in stimulating bone resorption.
disinfection by endodontic irrigants and dressings of experimentally infected dentinal tubules.
the effect of endodontic irrigants and dressings was tested on bacteria in bovine dentin specimens experimentally infected with enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, escherichia coli, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. standardized, cylindrical dentin test pieces were prepared and cleaned by ultrasonic treatment with edta and sodium hypochlorite. the specimens were infected with the test organism for periods up to 14 days, and the degree of infection into the tubules was monitored using brown & brenn stain, scanning electron microscopy, and culturing of dentin dust from sequential bur samples starting from the pulpal side. e. faecalis rapidly infected the whole length of the tubules; s. sanguis required up to 2 weeks for complete infection; e. coli only penetrated to some 600 microns, even after prolonged incubation periods. p. aeruginosa infected dentin quickly, but apparently in very low numbers. e. faecalis persisted for at least 10 d after withdrawal of nutrient support, whereas the other 3 organisms died within 4 to 48 h. endodontic medicaments were applied to infected specimen for comparison of antibacterial potency. camphorated p-monochlorophenol was generally more efficient than calasept, and of the irrigants tested, iodine potassium iodide appeared more potent than sodium hypochlorite or chlorhexidine. the presence of a smear layer delayed, but did not eliminate, the effect of the medicaments.
cloning and expression in escherichia coli of the genes of the arginine deiminase system of streptococcus sanguis nctc 10904.
the common oral bacterium streptococcus sanguis can degrade arginine via the arginine deiminase (ad) system. the three enzymes of this system, ad, ornithine carbamyltransferase (otc), and carbamate kinase (ck), catalyze the breakdown of arginine to ornithine, co2, and two molecules of ammonia, with the production of atp from adp. the genes of the ad system, which are subject to complex regulation in the oral streptococci, have been isolated in bacteriophage lambda by screening for ad activity. the ad gene, designated arca, was expressed from recombinant bacteriophage or in cells harboring plasmid subclones from this phage at a level up to 1,000-fold lower than the level in fully derepressed s. sanguis but apparently under the control of its own promoter. by subcloning in escherichia coli mutants defective in anabolic otc (argf argl) and ck (carb), it was demonstrated that the genes for s. sanguis otc and ck were located adjacent to the ad gene. the levels of expression of the otc and ck genes (arcb and arcc, respectively) were also very low in e. coli, although arcc expression was not as poor as arca and arcb expression when compared with the levels found in s. sanguis. also, arcb and arcc were unable to complement the defects in their anabolic counterparts. introduction of the entire ad system or subclones which encoded only the ad gene into e. coli harboring defects in arginine and pyrimidine biosynthesis resulted in a 10- to 15-fold decrease in the level of ad activity, suggesting that arginine or its metabolites may regulate ad expression. transposon mutagenesis was utilized to construct defined mutants of s. sanguis with mutations in the ad gene cluster. ad gene expression in these mutants indicated that the expression of the ad genes in this organism is strongly interrelated. the isolation and partial characterization of the arc genes represents the first step in the genetic manipulation of the ad system in the oral streptococci for analysis of the regulation of ad, analysis of the role of the system in plaque ecology, and utilization of the system to modulate the cariogenicity of dental plaque.
host-vector system for integration of recombinant dna into chromosomes of transformable and nontransformable streptococci.
we describe a genetic system in which transformation of streptococcus pneumoniae  and streptococcus sanguis was used to insert recombinant dna into the conjugative chromosomal element omega (cat tetm) 6001 (omega 6001). the element containing the recombinant dna was then transferred by conjugation to the chromosome of transformable and nontransformable streptococci. when escherichia coli plasmid pdp36 was used as donor in transformation, it was capable of inserting 5.9 kilobases of heterologous dna into the chromosome of competent streptococcal strains carrying omega 6001; the transformants were scored for erythromycin resistance. genetic analysis showed that in a fraction of the erythromycin-resistant transformants the integration via flanking homology of the heterologous dna caused inactivation of the tetm gene of omega 6001. by analyzing the stability of the resistance markers, we found that stable integration of heterologous dna was achieved only in the erythromycin-resistant, tetracycline-sensitive transformants. it was possible to detect conjugal transfer of the heterologous sequences from stable transformants to strains of s. pneumoniae, s. sanguis, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus faecalis. the omega 6001-pdp36 host-vector system opens new possibilities for gene transfer in streptococci. by this method cloned streptococcal dna (possibly mutagenized in vitro) can be returned to the original host, greatly facilitating complementation tests and fine physiological studies.
expression of the human interferon-alpha 1 gene under transcriptional and translational control of the spea gene.
the human gene for mature interferon-alpha 1 (ifn-alpha 1) was inserted in a new  transcription-translation fusion vector system based on the expression and secretion signals of the gene for type a streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin, spea. as deduced from the known nucleotide sequences of the component elements, the encoded ifn-alpha 1 was a fusion protein carrying an n-terminal extension of 17 amino acids. when inserted in appropriate vectors capable of replication in escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis and streptococcus sanguis, this expression configuration directed the synthesis of antiviral activity in all 3 organisms, as judged by the cythopathic effect inhibition assay of vesicular stomatitis virus. in e. coli jm101, ifn activity was found mainly in the cytoplasmic protein fraction whereas in the gram-positive hosts, it was completely secreted into the culture medium.
purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603 was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
