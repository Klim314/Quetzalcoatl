TI  == cofactor specificity of the bifunctional alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase (adhe) in wild-type and mutants of clostridium thermocellum and thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum.
AB  == clostridium thermocellum and thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum are thermophilic bacteria that have been engineered to produce ethanol from the cellulose and hemicellulose fractions of biomass respectively. although engineered strains of t. saccharolyticum produce ethanol with a yield of 90% of the theoretical maximum, engineered strains of c. thermocellum produce ethanol at lower yields ( approximately 50% of theoretical maximum). in the course of engineering these strains, a number of mutations have been discovered in their adhe genes, which encode both alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (aldh) enzymes. to understand the effect of these mutations, the adhe genes from six strains of c. thermocellum and t. saccharolyticum were cloned and expressed in escherichia coli, followed by purification by affinity chromatography and enzyme activity measurement. in wild type strains of both organisms, nadh was the preferred cofactor for both aldh and adh activity. in high ethanol-producing ("ethanologen") strains of t. saccharolyticum, both aldh and adh activities showed increased nadph-linked activity. interestingly, the ethanologenic strain of c. thermocellum, adhe has acquired high nadph-linked adh  activity while maintaining nadh-linked aldh and adh activity at wild-type levels. when single amino acid mutations in adhe, that caused increased nadph-linked adh  activity, were introduced into c. thermocellum and t. saccharolyticum, ethanol production increased in both organisms. structural analysis was performed for the wild-type and mutant adhe proteins to provide explanations for the cofactor specificity change on a molecular level. importance: this work describes the characterization of the adhe enzyme from different strains of c. thermocellum and t. saccharolyticum. c. thermocellum and t. saccharolyticum are thermophilic anaerobes that have been engineered to make high yields of ethanol and can solubilize components of plant biomass and ferment the sugars to ethanol. in the  course of engineering these strains, several mutations arose in the bifunctional  alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase adhe, changing both enzyme activity and cofactor specificity. we show that changing adhe cofactor specificity from mostly nadh-linked to mostly nadph-linked resulted in higher ethanol production in c. thermocellum and t. saccharolyticum.

TI  == gene knockout identification using an extension of bees hill flux balance analysis.
AB  == microbial strain optimisation for the overproduction of a desired phenotype has been a popular topic in recent years. gene knockout is a genetic engineering technique that can modify the metabolism of microbial cells to obtain desirable phenotypes. optimisation algorithms have been developed to identify the effects of gene knockout. however, the complexities of metabolic networks have made the process of identifying the effects of genetic modification on desirable phenotypes challenging. furthermore, a vast number of reactions in cellular metabolism often lead to a combinatorial problem in obtaining optimal gene knockout. the computational time increases exponentially as the size of the problem increases. this work reports an extension of bees hill flux balance analysis (bhfba) to identify optimal gene knockouts to maximise the production yield of desired phenotypes while sustaining the growth rate. this proposed method functions by integrating optknock into bhfba for validating the results automatically. the results show that the extension of bhfba is suitable, reliable, and applicable in predicting gene knockout. through several experiments conducted on escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, and clostridium thermocellum as model organisms, extension of bhfba has shown better performance in terms of computational time, stability, growth rate, and production yield of desired phenotypes.

TI  == analysis of strand-specific rna-seq data using machine learning reveals the structures of transcription units in clostridium thermocellum.
AB  == identification of transcription units (tus) encoded in a bacterial genome is essential to elucidation of transcriptional regulation of the organism. to gain a detailed understanding of the dynamically composed tu structures, we have used four strand-specific rna-seq (ssrna-seq) datasets collected under two experimental conditions to derive the genomic tu organization of clostridium thermocellum using a machine-learning approach. our method accurately predicted the genomic boundaries of individual tus based on two sets of parameters measuring the rna-seq expression patterns across the genome: expression-level continuity and variance. a total of 2590 distinct tus are predicted based on the  four rna-seq datasets. among the predicted tus, 44% have multiple genes. we assessed our prediction method on an independent set of rna-seq data with longer  reads. the evaluation confirmed the high quality of the predicted tus. functional enrichment analyses on a selected subset of the predicted tus revealed interesting biology. to demonstrate the generality of the prediction method, we have also applied the method to rna-seq data collected on escherichia coli and achieved high prediction accuracies. the tu prediction program named seqtu is publicly available at https://code.google.com/p/seqtu/. we expect that the predicted tus can serve as the baseline information for studying transcriptional  and post-transcriptional regulation in c. thermocellum and other bacteria.

TI  == crystallization and preliminary x-ray diffraction studies of the family 54 carbohydrate-binding module from laminarinase (beta-1,3-glucanase) lic16a of clostridium thermocellum.
AB  == the crystallization and preliminary x-ray diffraction analysis of the carbohydrate-binding module (cbm) from laminarinase lic16a of the hyperthermophilic anaerobic bacterium clostridium thermocellum (ctcbm54) are reported. recombinant ctcbm54 was prepared using an escherichia coli/pqe30 overexpression system and was crystallized by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. x-ray diffraction data were collected to 2.1 a resolution using synchrotron radiation. the crystals belonged to space group p6322, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 130.15, c = 131.05 a. the three-dimensional structure of ctcbm54 will provide valuable information about the structure-function relation of the laminarinase lic16a and will allow the exploitation of this binding module in biotechnological applications.

TI  == structure, activity, and stability of metagenome-derived glycoside hydrolase family 9 endoglucanase with an n-terminal ig-like domain.
AB  == a metagenome-derived glycoside hydrolase family 9 enzyme with an n-terminal immunoglobulin-like (ig-like) domain, leaf-branch compost (lc)-celg, was characterized and its crystal structure was determined. lc-celg did not hydrolyze p-nitrophenyl cellobioside but hydrolyzed cm-cellulose, indicating that it is endoglucanase. lc-celg exhibited the highest activity at 70 degrees c and >80% of the maximal activity at a broad ph range of 5-9. its denaturation temperature was 81.4 degrees c, indicating that lc-celg is a thermostable enzyme. the structure of lc-celg resembles those of celd from clostridium thermocellum (ctceld), cel9a  from alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius (aacel9a), and cellobiohydrolase cbha from c. thermocellum (ctcbha), which show relatively low (29-31%) amino acid sequence  identities to lc-celg. three acidic active site residues are conserved as asp194, asp197, and glu558 in lc-celg. ten of the thirteen residues that form the substrate binding pocket of aacel9a are conserved in lc-celg. removal of the ig-like domain reduced the activity and stability of lc-celg by 100-fold and 6.3  degrees c, respectively. removal of the gln40- and asp99-mediated interactions between the ig-like and catalytic domains destabilized lc-celg by 5.0 degrees c without significantly affecting its activity. these results suggest that the ig-like domain contributes to the stabilization of lc-celg mainly due to the gln40- and asp99-mediated interactions. because the lc-celg derivative lacking the ig-like domain accumulated in escherichia coli cells mostly in an insoluble form and this derivative accumulated in a soluble form exhibited very weak activity, the ig-like domain may be required to make the conformation of the active site functional and prevent aggregation of the catalytic domain.

TI  == differential bees flux balance analysis with optknock for in silico microbial strains optimization.
AB  == microbial strains optimization for the overproduction of desired phenotype has been a popular topic in recent years. the strains can be optimized through several techniques in the field of genetic engineering. gene knockout is a genetic engineering technique that can engineer the metabolism of microbial cells with the objective to obtain desirable phenotypes. however, the complexities of the metabolic networks have made the process to identify the effects of genetic modification on the desirable phenotypes challenging. furthermore, a vast number  of reactions in cellular metabolism often lead to the combinatorial problem in obtaining optimal gene deletion strategy. basically, the size of a genome-scale metabolic model is usually large. as the size of the problem increases, the computation time increases exponentially. in this paper, we propose differential  bees flux balance analysis (dbfba) with optknock to identify optimal gene knockout strategies for maximizing the production yield of desired phenotypes while sustaining the growth rate. this proposed method functions by improving the performance of a hybrid of bees algorithm and flux balance analysis (bafba) by hybridizing differential evolution (de) algorithm into neighborhood searching strategy of bafba. in addition, dbfba is integrated with optknock to validate the results for improving the reliability the work. through several experiments conducted on escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, and clostridium thermocellum as the model organisms, dbfba has shown a better performance in terms of computational time, stability, growth rate, and production yield of desired phenotypes compared to the methods used in previous works.

TI  == construction of gh16 beta-glucanase mini-cellulosomes to improve the nutritive value of barley-based diets for broilers.
AB  == anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria organize a comprehensive range of cellulases and  hemicellulases in high molecular weight multienzyme complexes termed cellulosomes. integration of cellulosomal components occurs via highly ordered protein-protein interactions between cohesins and dockerins. this paper reports the production of mini-cellulosomes containing one (gh16-1c) or three (gh16-3c) copies of clostridium thermocellum glucanase 16a (ctglc16a). barley beta-1,3-1,4-glucans are known to be antinutritive for monogastric animals, particularly for poultry. gh16-1c and gh16-3c were used to supplement barley-based diets for broilers. the data revealed that the two mini-cellulosomes effectively improved the nutritive value of barley-based diets for broilers. analysis of mini-cellulosome molecular integrity revealed that linker sequences separating protein domains in scaffoldins and cellulosomal catalytic units are highly susceptible to proteolytic attack in vivo. the data suggest that linker protection could result in further improvements in enzyme efficacy to improve the nutritive value of barley-based diets for monogastric animals.

TI  == engineered platform for bioethylene production by a cyanobacterium expressing a chimeric complex of plant enzymes.
AB  == ethylene is an industrially important compound, but more sustainable production methods are desirable. since cellulosomes increase the ability of cellulolytic enzymes by physically linking the relevant enzymes via dockerin-cohesin interactions, in this study, we genetically engineered a chimeric cellulosome-like complex of two ethylene-generating enzymes from tomato using cohesin-dockerins from the bacteria clostridium thermocellum and acetivibrio cellulolyticus. this complex was transformed into escherichia coli to analyze kinetic parameters and enzyme complex formation and into the cyanobacterium synechococcus elongatus pcc 7942, which was then grown with and without 0.1 mm isopropyl beta-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (iptg) induction. only at minimal protein expression levels (without iptg), the chimeric complex produced 3.7 times more ethylene in vivo than did uncomplexed enzymes. thus, cyanobacteria can be used to sustainably generate ethylene, and the synthetic enzyme complex greatly enhanced production efficiency. artificial synthetic enzyme complexes hold great  promise for improving the production efficiency of other industrial compounds.

TI  == cbd binding domain fused gamma-lactamase from sulfolobus solfataricus is an efficient catalyst for (-) gamma-lactam production.
AB  == background: gamma-lactamase is used for the resolution of gamma-lactam which is utilized in the synthesizing of abacavir and peramivir. in some cases, enzymatic  method is the most utilized method because of its high efficiency and productivity. the cellulose binding domain (cbd) of cellulose is often used as the bio-specific affinity matrix for enzyme immobilization. cellulose is cheap and it has excellent chemical and physical properties. meanwhile, binding between cellulose and cbd is tight and the desorption rarely happened. results: we prepared two fusion constructs of the gamma-lactamase gene gla, which was from sulfolobus solfataricus p2. these two constructs had cbd (cellulose binding domain from clostridium thermocellum) fused at amino or carboxyl terminus of the  gamma-lactamase. these two constructs were heterogeneously expressed in e. coli rosetta (de3) as two fusion proteins. both of them were immobilized well on avicel (microcrystalline cellulose matrix). the apparent kinetic parameters revealed that carboxyl terminus fused protein (gla-linker-cbd) was a better catalyst. the v(max) and k(cat) value of avicel immobilized gla-linker-cbd were 381 u mg(-)(1) and 4.7 x 10(5) s(-)(1) respectively. and the values of the free gla-linker-cbd were 151 u mg(-)(1) and 1.8 x 10(5) s(-)(1) respectively. these data indicated that the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme was upgraded after immobilization. the immobilized gla-linker-cbd had a 10-degree temperature optimum dropping from 80 degrees c to 70 degrees c but it was stable when incubated at 60 degrees c for 48 h. it remained stable in catalyzing 20-batch reactions. after optimization, the immobilized enzyme concentration in transformation was set as 200 mg/ml. we found out that there was inhibition that  occurred to the immobilized enzyme when substrate concentration exceeded 60 mm. finally a 10 ml-volume transformation was conducted, in which 0.6 m substrate was hydrolyzed and the resolution was completed within 9 h with a 99.5% ee value. conclusions: cellulose is the most abundant and renewable material on the earth.  the absorption between cbd domain and cellulose is a bio-green process. the cellulose immobilized fusion gla exhibited good catalytic characters, therefore we think the cellulose immobilized gla is a promising catalyst for the industrial preparation of (-) - gamma-lactam.

TI  == potent and specific inhibition of glycosidases by small artificial binding proteins (affitins).
AB  == glycosidases are associated with various human diseases. the development of efficient and specific inhibitors may provide powerful tools to modulate their activity. however, achieving high selectivity is a major challenge given that glycosidases with different functions can have similar enzymatic mechanisms and active-site architectures. as an alternative approach to small-chemical compounds, proteinaceous inhibitors might provide a better specificity by involving a larger surface area of interaction. we report here the design and characterization of proteinaceous inhibitors that specifically target endoglycosidases representative of the two major mechanistic classes; retaining and inverting glycosidases. these inhibitors consist of artificial affinity proteins, affitins, selected against the thermophilic celd from clostridium thermocellum and lysozyme from hen egg. they were obtained from libraries of sac7d variants, which involve either the randomization of a surface or the randomization of a surface and an artificially-extended loop. glycosidase binders exhibited affinities in the nanomolar range with no cross-recognition, with efficient inhibition of lysozyme (ki = 45 nm) and celd (ki = 95 and 111 nm), high expression yields in escherichia coli, solubility, and thermal stabilities up to  81.1 degrees c. the crystal structures of glycosidase-affitin complexes validate  our library designs. we observed that affitins prevented substrate access by two  modes of binding; covering or penetrating the catalytic site via the extended loop. in addition, affitins formed salt-bridges with residues essential for enzymatic activity. these results lead us to propose the use of affitins as versatile selective glycosidase inhibitors and, potentially, as enzymatic inhibitors in general.

TI  == optgpsampler: an improved tool for uniformly sampling the solution-space of genome-scale metabolic networks.
AB  == constraint-based models of metabolic networks are typically underdetermined, because they contain more reactions than metabolites. therefore the solutions to  this system do not consist of unique flux rates for each reaction, but rather a space of possible flux rates. by uniformly sampling this space, an estimated probability distribution for each reaction's flux in the network can be obtained. however, sampling a high dimensional network is time-consuming. furthermore, the  constraints imposed on the network give rise to an irregularly shaped solution space. therefore more tailored, efficient sampling methods are needed. we propose an efficient sampling algorithm (called optgpsampler), which implements the artificial centering hit-and-run algorithm in a different manner than the sampling algorithm implemented in the cobra toolbox for metabolic network analysis, here called gpsampler. results of extensive experiments on different genome-scale metabolic networks show that optgpsampler is up to 40 times faster than gpsampler. application of existing convergence diagnostics on small network  reconstructions indicate that optgpsampler converges roughly ten times faster than gpsampler towards similar sampling distributions. for networks of higher dimension (i.e. containing more than 500 reactions), we observed significantly better convergence of optgpsampler and a large deviation between the samples generated by the two algorithms. availability: optgpsampler for matlab and python is available for non-commercial use at: http://cs.ru.nl/~wmegchel/optgpsampler/.

TI  == fine-structural variance of family 3 carbohydrate-binding modules as extracellular biomass-sensing components of clostridium thermocellum anti-sigmai  factors.
AB  == the anaerobic, thermophilic, cellulosome-producing bacterium clostridium thermocellum relies on a variety of carbohydrate-active enzymes in order to efficiently break down complex carbohydrates into utilizable simple sugars. the regulation mechanism of the cellulosomal genes was unknown until recently, when genomic analysis revealed a set of putative operons in c. thermocellum that encode sigmai factors (i.e. alternative sigma factors that control specialized regulon activation) and their cognate anti-sigmai factor (rsgi). these putative anti-sigmai-factor proteins have modules that are believed to be carbohydrate sensors. three of these modules were crystallized and their three-dimensional structures were solved. the structures show a high overall degree of sequence and structural similarity to the cellulosomal family 3 carbohydrate-binding modules (cbm3s). the structures of the three carbohydrate sensors (rsgi-cbm3s) and a reference cbm3 are compared in the context of the structural determinants for the specificity of cellulose and complex carbohydrate binding. fine structural variations among the rsgi-cbm3s appear to result in alternative substrate preferences for each of the sensors.

AB  == this study investigated the role of cbm35 from clostridium thermocellum (ctcbm35) in polysaccharide recognition. ctcbm35 was cloned into pet28a (+) vector with an  engineered his6 tag and expressed in escherichia coli bl21 (de3) cells. a homogenous 15 kda protein was purified by immobilized metal ion chromatography (imac). ligand binding analysis of ctcbm35 was carried out by affinity electrophoresis using various soluble ligands. ctcbm35 showed a manno-configured  ligand specific binding displaying significant association with konjac glucomannan (ka = 14.3x10(4) m(-1)), carob galactomannan (ka = 12.4x10(4) m(-1))  and negligible association (ka = 12 microm(-1)) with insoluble mannan. binding of ctcbm35 with polysaccharides which was calcium dependent exhibited two fold higher association in presence of 10 mm ca(2+) ion with konjac glucomannan (ka =  41x10(4) m(-1)) and carob galactomannan (ka = 30x10(4) m(-1)). the polysaccharide binding was further investigated by fluorescence spectrophotometric studies. on binding with carob galactomannan and konjac glucomannan the conformation of ctcbm35 changed significantly with regular 21 nm peak shifts towards lower quantum yield. the degree of association (k a) with konjac glucomannan and carob  galactomannan, 14.3x10(4) m(-1) and 11.4x10(4) m(-1), respectively, corroborated  the findings from affinity electrophoresis. the association of ctcbm35with konjac glucomannan led to higher free energy of binding (deltag) -25 kj mole(-1) as compared to carob galactomannan (deltag) -22 kj mole(-1). on binding ctcbm35 with konjac glucomannan and carob galactomannan the hydrodynamic radius (rh) as analysed by dynamic light scattering (dls) study, increased to 8 nm and 6 nm, respectively, from 4.25 nm in absence of ligand. the presence of 10 mm ca(2+) ions imparted stiffer orientation of ctcbm35 particles with increased rh of 4.52  nm. due to such stiffer orientation ctcbm35 became more thermostable and its melting temperature was shifted to 70 degrees c from initial 50 degrees c.

TI  == continuous live cell imaging of cellulose attachment by microbes under anaerobic  and thermophilic conditions using confocal microscopy.

TI  == the nature of the carbohydrate binding module determines the catalytic efficiency of xylanase z of clostridium thermocellum.
AB  == xylanase z of clostridium thermocellum exists as a complex in the cellulosome with n-terminus feruloyl esterase, a carbohydrate binding module (cbm6) and a dockerin domain. to study the role of the binding modules on the activity of xynz, different variants with the cbm6 attached to the catalytic domain at its c-terminal (xynz-cb) and n-terminal (xynz-bc), and the cbm22 attached at n-terminus (xynz-b'c) were expressed in escherichia coli at levels around 30% of  the total cell proteins. the activities of xynz-bc, xynz-cb and xynz-b'c were 4200, 4180 and 20,700u mum(-1) against birchwood xylan, respectively. substrate binding studies showed that in case of xynz-bc and xynz-cb the substrate birchwood xylan remaining unbound were 51 and 52%, respectively, whereas in the case of xynz-b'c the substrate remaining unbound was 39% under the assay conditions used. the molecular docking studies showed that the binding site of cbm22 in xynz-b'c is more exposed and thus available for substrate binding as compared to the tunnel shape binding pocket produced in xynz-bc and thus hindering the substrate binding. the substrate binding data for the two constructs are in agreement with this explanation.

AB  == simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (ssf) studies of steam exploded and alkali pretreated different leafy biomass were accomplished by recombinant clostridium thermocellum hydrolytic enzymes and fermentative microbes for bioethanol production. the recombinant c. thermocellum gh5 cellulase and gh43 hemicellulase genes expressed in escherichia coli cells were grown in repetitive  batch mode, with the aim of enhancing the cell biomass production and enzyme activity. in batch mode, the cell biomass (a(600 nm)) of e. coli cells and enzyme activities of gh5 cellulase and gh43 hemicellulase were 1.4 and 1.6 with 2.8 and  2.2 u.mg(-)(1), which were augmented to 2.8 and 2.9 with 5.6 and 3.8 u.mg(-)(1) in repetitive batch mode, respectively. steam exploded wild grass (achnatherum hymenoides) provided the best ethanol titres as compared to other biomasses. mixed enzyme (gh5 cellulase, gh43 hemicellulase) mixed culture (saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida shehatae) system gave 2-fold higher ethanol titre than single enzyme (gh5 cellulase) single culture (saccharomyces cerevisiae) system employing 1% (w/v) pretreated substrate. 5% (w/v) substrate gave 11.2 g.l(-)(1) of ethanol  at shake flask level which on scaling up to 2 l bioreactor resulted in 23 g.l(-)(1) ethanol. 91.6% (v/v) ethanol was recovered by rotary evaporator with 21.2% purification efficiency.

TI  == a useful method integrating production and immobilization of recombinant cellulase.
AB  == the development of cellulase-based bioprocess is afflicted by the processing efficiency of enzymes. to address this issue, a method based on artificial oil bodies (aobs) was proposed to integrate production and immobilization of recombinant cellulase. first, the heterologous endoglucanase (cela), cellobiohydrolase (celk), and beta-glucosidase (gls) genes were individually fused with oleosin, a structural protein of plant seed oils. after expression in  escherichia coli, each fusion protein of insolubility was mixed together with plant oils. aobs were assembled by subjecting the mixture to sonication. consequently, active cela, celk, and gls were resumed and co-immobilized on aobs  surface. finally, the assembly condition (including the protein ratio) and the reaction condition were further optimized by response surface methodology. the resulting aobs-bound cellulase remained stable for 4 cycles of cellulose-hydrolyzed reactions. overall, the result shows a promise of this proposed approach for processing recombinant cellulase, which may provide a facile method to investigate optimum combination of cellulase components towards  various cellulosic materials.

TI  == a novel alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase of family 43 glycoside hydrolase (ct43araf) from clostridium thermocellum.
AB  == the study describes a comparative analysis of biochemical, structural and functional properties of two recombinant derivatives from clostridium thermocellum atcc 27405 belonging to family 43 glycoside hydrolase. the family 43 glycoside hydrolase encoding alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase (ct43araf) displayed an  n-terminal catalytic module ctgh43 (903 bp) followed by two carbohydrate binding  modules ctcbm6a (405 bp) and ctcbm6b (402 bp) towards the c-terminal. ct43araf and its truncated derivative ctgh43 were cloned in pet-vectors, expressed in escherichia coli and functionally characterized. the recombinant proteins displayed molecular sizes of 63 kda (ct43araf) and 34 kda (ctgh43) on sds-page analysis. ct43araf and ctgh43 showed optimal enzyme activities at ph 5.7 and 5.4  and the optimal temperature for both was 50 degrees c. ct43araf and ctgh43 showed maximum activity with rye arabinoxylan 4.7 umg(-1) and 5.0 umg(-1), respectively, which increased by more than 2-fold in presence of ca(2+) and mg(2+) salts. this  indicated that the presence of cbms (ctcbm6a and ctcbm6b) did not have any effect on the enzyme activity. the thin layer chromatography and high pressure anion exchange chromatography analysis of ct43araf hydrolysed arabinoxylans (rye and wheat) and oat spelt xylan confirmed the release of l-arabinose. this is the first report of alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase from c. thermocellum having the capacity to degrade both p-nitrophenol-alpha-l-arabinofuranoside and p-nitrophenol-alpha-l-arabinopyranoside. the protein melting curves of ct43araf and ctgh43 demonstrated that ctgh43 and cbms melt independently. the presence of  ca(2+) ions imparted thermal stability to both the enzymes. the circular dichroism analysis of ctgh43 showed 48% beta-sheets, 49% random coils but only 3% alpha-helices.

TI  == a hybrid of bees algorithm and flux balance analysis with optknock as a platform  for in silico optimization of microbial strains.
AB  == microbial strain optimization focuses on improving technological properties of the strain of microorganisms. however, the complexities of the metabolic networks, which lead to data ambiguity, often cause genetic modification on the desirable phenotypes difficult to predict. furthermore, vast number of reactions  in cellular metabolism lead to the combinatorial problem in obtaining optimal gene deletion strategy. consequently, the computation time increases exponentially with the increase in the size of the problem. hence, we propose an  extension of a hybrid of bees algorithm and flux balance analysis (bafba) by integrating optknock into bafba to validate the result. this paper presents a number of computational experiments to test on the performance and capability of  bafba. escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis and clostridium thermocellum are the model organisms in this paper. also included is the identification of potential reactions to improve the production of succinic acid, lactic acid and ethanol, plus the discussion on the changes in the flux distribution of the predicted mutants. bafba shows potential in suggesting the non-intuitive gene knockout strategies and a low variability among the several runs. the results show that bafba is suitable, reliable and applicable in predicting optimal gene knockout strategy.

TI  == a targetron system for gene targeting in thermophiles and its application in clostridium thermocellum.
AB  == background: targetrons are gene targeting vectors derived from mobile group ii introns. they consist of an autocatalytic intron rna (a "ribozyme") and an intron-encoded reverse transcriptase, which use their combined activities to achieve highly efficient site-specific dna integration with readily programmable  dna target specificity. methodology/principal findings: here, we used a mobile group ii intron from the thermophilic cyanobacterium thermosynechococcus elongatus to construct a thermotargetron for gene targeting in thermophiles. after determining its dna targeting rules by intron mobility assays in escherichia coli at elevated temperatures, we used this thermotargetron in clostridium thermocellum, a thermophile employed in biofuels production, to disrupt six different chromosomal genes (cipa, hfat, hyd, ldh, pta, and pyrf). high integration efficiencies (67-100% without selection) were achieved, enabling detection of disruptants by colony pcr screening of a small number of transformants. because the thermotargetron functions at high temperatures that promote dna melting, it can recognize dna target sequences almost entirely by base pairing of the intron rna with less contribution from the intron-encoded protein than for mesophilic targetrons. this feature increases the number of potential targetron-insertion sites, while only moderately decreasing dna target  specificity. phenotypic analysis showed that thermotargetron disruption of the genes encoding lactate dehydrogenase (ldh; clo1313_1160) and phosphotransacetylase (pta; clo1313_1185) increased ethanol production in c. thermocellum by decreasing carbon flux toward lactate and acetate. conclusions/significance: thermotargetron provides a new, rapid method for gene targeting and genetic engineering of c. thermocellum, an industrially important microbe, and should be readily adaptable for gene targeting in other thermophiles.

TI  == functional display of complex cellulosomes on the yeast surface via adaptive assembly.
AB  == a new adaptive strategy was developed for the ex vivo assembly of a functional tetravalent designer cellulosome on the yeast cell surface. the design is based on the use of (1) a surface-bound anchoring scaffoldin composed of two divergent  cohesin domains, (2) two dockerin-tagged adaptor scaffoldins to amplify the number of enzyme loading sites based on the specific dockerin-cohesin interaction with the anchoring scaffoldin, and (3) two dockerin-tagged enzymatic subunits (the endoglucanse gt and the beta-glucosidase bglf) for cellulose hydrolysis. cells displaying the tetravalent cellulosome on the surface exhibited a 4.2-fold  enhancement in the hydrolysis of phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (pasc) compared with free enzymes. more importantly, cells displaying the tetravalent celluosome also exhibited an ~2-fold increase in ethanol production compared with cells displaying a divalent cellulosome using a similar enzyme loading. these results clearly indicate the more crucial role of enzyme proximity than just simply increasing the enzyme loading on the overall cellulosomal synergy. to the  best of our knowledge, this is the first report that exploits the natural adaptive assembly strategy in creating artificial cellulosome structures. the unique feature of the anchoring and the adaptor scaffoldin strategy to amplify the number of enzymatic subunits can be easily extended to more complex cellulosomal structures to achieve an even higher level of enzyme synergy.

TI  == cell-free protein synthesis and substrate specificity of full-length endoglucanase celj (cel9d-cel44a), the largest multi-enzyme subunit of the clostridium thermocellum cellulosome.
AB  == endoglucanase celj (cel9d-cel44a) is the largest multi-enzyme subunit of the clostridium thermocellum cellulosome and is composed of glycoside hydrolase (gh)  families 9 and 44 (gh9 and gh44) and carbohydrate-binding module (cbm) families 30 and 44 (cbm30 and cbm44). the study of celj has been hampered by the inability to isolate full-length celj from recombinant escherichia coli cells. here, full-length celj and its n- and c-terminal segments, cbm30-gh9 (cel9d) and gh44-cbm44 (cel44a), were synthesized using a wheat germ cell-free protein synthesis system and then were purified to homogeneity. analysis of the substrate specificities of celj and its derivatives demonstrated that the fusion of cel9d and cel44a results in threefold synergy for the degradation of xyloglucan, one of the major structural polysaccharides of plant cell walls. because celj displayed  broad substrate specificity including significant carboxymethylcellulase (cmcase) and xylanase activities in addition to high xyloglucanase activity, celj may play an important role in the degradation of plant cell walls, which are composed of highly heterogeneous polysaccharides. furthermore, because cel9d, but not cel44a, acts as a semi-processive endoglucanase, the different modes of action between cel9d and cel44a may be responsible for the observed synergistic effect on the activity of celj (cel9d-cel44a).

TI  == effects of synthetic cohesin-containing scaffold protein architecture on binding  dockerin-enzyme fusions on the surface of lactococcus lactis.
AB  == background: the microbial synthesis of fuels, commodity chemicals, and bioactive  compounds necessitates the assemblage of multiple enzyme activities to carry out  sequential chemical reactions, often via substrate channeling by means of multi-domain or multi-enzyme complexes. engineering the controlled incorporation  of enzymes in recombinant protein complexes is therefore of interest. the cellulosome of clostridium thermocellum is an extracellular enzyme complex that efficiently hydrolyzes crystalline cellulose. enzymes interact with protein scaffolds via type 1 dockerin/cohesin interactions, while scaffolds in turn bind  surface anchor proteins by means of type 2 dockerin/cohesin interactions, which demonstrate a different binding specificity than their type 1 counterparts. recombinant chimeric scaffold proteins containing cohesins of different specificity allow binding of multiple enzymes to specific sites within an engineered complex. results: we report the successful display of engineered chimeric scaffold proteins containing both type 1 and type 2 cohesins on the surface of lactococcus lactis cells. the chimeric scaffold proteins were able to  form complexes with the escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase fused to either type  1 or type 2 dockerin, and differences in binding efficiencies were correlated with scaffold architecture. we used e. coli beta-galactosidase, also fused to type 1 or type 2 dockerins, to demonstrate the targeted incorporation of two enzymes into the complexes. the simultaneous binding of enzyme pairs each containing a different dockerin resulted in bi-enzymatic complexes tethered to the cell surface. the sequential binding of the two enzymes yielded insights into parameters affecting assembly of the complex such as protein size and position within the scaffold. conclusions: the spatial organization of enzymes into complexes is an important strategy for increasing the efficiency of biochemical pathways. in this study, chimeric protein scaffolds consisting of type 1 and type 2 cohesins anchored on the surface of l. lactis allowed for the controlled positioning of dockerin-fused reporter enzymes onto the scaffolds. by binding single enzymes or enzyme pairs to the scaffolds, our data also suggest that the size and relative positions of enzymes can affect the catalytic profiles of the resulting complexes. these insights will be of great value as we engineer more advanced scaffold-guided protein complexes to optimize biochemical pathways.

TI  == crystal structure of 1,3gal43a, an exo-beta-1,3-galactanase from clostridium thermocellum.
AB  == glycoside hydrolase family 43 (gh43) consists of a variety of enzymes distributed widely in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. the mechanism by which gh43 enzymes hydrolyze oligosaccharides requires three essential acidic amino acid residues. however, one of them is thought to be missing in galactan beta-1,3-galactosidases from the gh43 family. ct1,3gal43a, from clostridium thermocellum, is comprised of a gh43 domain, a cbm13 domain, and a dockerin domain and exhibits an unusual ability to hydrolyze beta-1,3-galactan in the presence of a beta-1,6 linked branch. here, we present its crystal structure at 2.7 a resolution and complex structures of the enzyme with several substrates and analogs. two modes of substrate binding were observed at the beta site of the ctcbm13 domain, and one galactobiose molecule was found in an "l" shaped pocket of the ctgh43 domain, which appears large enough to accommodate two more galactose units. in addition,  we found that mutating glu112 to gln or ala eliminated the galactan hydrolysis activity of ct1,3gal43a while did not disrupt its ligand binding ability. combining this results and the crystal structure we identified glu112 in ct1,3gal43a as the 'missing' essential acidic residue in galactan beta-1,3-galactosidases. structural information presented here also suggests a mechanism by which ct1,3gal43a bypasses beta-1,6 linked branches in the substrate and another mechanism by which the substrate is delivered 'in trans' from the cbm13 domain to the catalytic gh43 domain.

TI  == size-modulated synergy of cellulase clustering for enhanced cellulose hydrolysis.
AB  == immobilization of enzymes onto nanoparticles for enhanced biocatalytic activity via enzyme clustering is a growing field. in this paper, the effect of nanoparticle size on the hydrolytic activity of artificial cellulosomes was investigated. a simple method based on metal affinity coordination was employed to directly conjugate two enzymes, an endoglucanase cela and an exoglucanase cele, onto cdse-zns core-shell quantum dots (qds) without the use of any chemical modification or linker molecules such as streptavidin. artificial cellulosomes were created by clustering the enzymes onto two different qds (5 and 10 nm) to systematically study the influence of particle size and qd to enzyme ratio on the enhancement in cellulose hydrolysis. our results indicate that enzyme proximity is the most important factor for activity enhancement while the influence of particle size is relatively modest. this detailed understanding will provide insights for the design of other artificial cellulosomes based on nanoclustering  of multiple catalytic domains with significantly enhanced activities, and may be  applicable for designing improved nanobiocatalysts for biofuel production, bioremediation, and drug design.

AB  == xynx of thermoanaerobacterium sp. [corrected] is a large, multimodular xylanase of 116 kda. an escherichia coli transformant carrying the entire xynx produced three active truncated xylanase species of 105, 85, and 64 kda intracellularly. the bacillus subtilis wb700 transformant with the xynx, a strain deficient in seven proteases including vpr, secreted two active truncated xylanase species of  65 and 44 kda. the b. subtilis wb800 transformant with xynx, a strain deficient in eight proteases including vpr and wpra, secreted more active enzymes, 8.46 u ml(-1), mostly in the form of 105 and 85 kda, than the wb700 transformant, 6.93 u ml(-1). this indicates that the additional deletion of wpra enabled the wb800 to  secrete xynx in its intact form. b. subtilis wb800 produced more total enzyme activity than e. coli (1,692 +/- 274 u vs. 141.9 +/- 27.1 u), and, more importantly, secreted almost all the enzyme activity. the results suggest the potential use of b. subtilis wb800 as a host system for the production of large multimodular proteins.

TI  == measurements of relative binding of cohesin and dockerin mutants using an advanced elisa technique for high-affinity interactions.
AB  == the cellulosome is a large bacterial extracellular multienzyme complex able to degrade crystalline cellulosic substrates. the complex contains catalytic and noncatalytic subunits, interconnected by high-affinity cohesin-dockerin interactions. in this chapter, we introduce an optimized method for comparative binding among different cohesins or cohesin mutants to the dockerin partner. this assay offers advantages over other methods (such as elisa, celia, spr, and itc) for particularly high-affinity binding interactions. in this approach, the high-affinity interaction of interest occurs in the liquid phase during the equilibrated binding step, whereas the interaction with the immobilized phase is  used only for detection of the unbound dockerins that remain in the solution phase. once equilibrium conditions are reached, the change in free energy of binding (deltadeltag(binding)), as well as the affinity constant of mutants, can  be estimated against the known affinity constant of the wild-type interaction. in light of the above, we propose this method as a preferred alternative for the relative quantification of high-affinity protein interactions.

TI  == escherichia coli expression, purification, crystallization, and structure determination of bacterial cohesin-dockerin complexes.
AB  == cellulosomes are highly efficient nanomachines that play a fundamental role during the anaerobic deconstruction of complex plant cell wall carbohydrates. the assembly of these complex nanomachines results from the very tight binding of repetitive cohesin modules, located in a noncatalytic molecular scaffold, and dockerin domains located at the c-terminus of the enzyme components of the cellulosome. the number of enzymes found in a cellulosome varies but may reach more than 100 catalytic subunits if cellulosomes are further organized in polycellulosomes, through a second type of cohesin-dockerin interaction. structural studies have revealed how the cohesin-dockerin interaction mediates cellulosome assembly and cell-surface attachment, while retaining the flexibility required to potentiate catalytic synergy within the complex. methods that might be applied for the production, purification, and structure determination of cohesin-dockerin complexes are described here.

TI  == engineering a high-affinity scaffold for non-chromatographic protein purification via intein-mediated cleavage.
AB  == while protein purification has long been dominated by standard chromatography, the relatively high cost and complex scale-up have promoted the development of alternative non-chromatographic separation methods. here we developed a new non-chromatographic affinity method for the purification of proteins expressed in escherichia coli. the approach is to genetically fuse the target proteins with an affinity tag. direct purification and recovery can be achieved using a thermo-responsive elastin-like protein (elp) scaffold containing the capturing domain. naturally occurring cohesin-dockerin pairs, which are high-affinity protein complex responsible for the formation of cellulosome in anaerobic bacteria, were used as the model. by exploiting the highly specific interaction between the dockerin and cohesin domain from clostridium thermocellum and the reversible aggregation property of elp, highly purified and active dockerin-tagged proteins, such as the endoglucanase cela, chloramphenicol acetyl  transferase (cat), and enhanced green fluorescence protein (egfp), were recovered directly from crude cell extracts in a single thermal precipitation step with yields achieving over 90%. incorporation of a self-cleaving intein domain enabled rapid removal of the affinity tag from the target proteins, which was subsequently removed by another cycle of thermal precipitation. this method offers great flexibility as a wide range of affinity tags and ligands can be used.

TI  == influence of a mannan binding family 32 carbohydrate binding module on the activity of the appended mannanase.
AB  == in general, cellulases and hemicellulases are modular enzymes in which the catalytic domain is appended to one or more noncatalytic carbohydrate binding modules (cbms). cbms, by concentrating the parental enzyme at their target polysaccharide, increase the capacity of the catalytic module to bind the substrate, leading to a potentiation in catalysis. clostridium thermocellum hypothetical protein cthe_0821, defined here as c. thermocellum man5a, is a modular protein comprising an n-terminal signal peptide, a family 5 glycoside hydrolase (gh5) catalytic module, a family 32 cbm (cbm32), and a c-terminal type  i dockerin module. recent proteomic studies revealed that cthe_0821 is one of the major cellulosomal enzymes when c. thermocellum is cultured on cellulose. here we show that the gh5 catalytic module of cthe_0821 displays endomannanase activity.  c. thermocellum man5a hydrolyzes soluble konjac glucomannan, soluble carob galactomannan, and insoluble ivory nut mannan but does not attack the highly galactosylated mannan from guar gum, suggesting that the enzyme prefers unsubstituted beta-1,4-mannoside linkages. the cbm32 of c. thermocellum man5a displays a preference for the nonreducing ends of mannooligosaccharides, although the protein module exhibits measurable affinity for the termini of beta-1,4-linked glucooligosaccharides such as cellobiose. cbm32 potentiates the activity of c. thermocellum man5a against insoluble mannans but has no significant effect on the capacity of the enzyme to hydrolyze soluble galactomannans and glucomannans. the product profile of c. thermocellum man5a is  affected by the presence of cbm32.

AB  == isocitrate dehydrogenase (idh) catalyzes the oxidative nad(p)(+)-dependent decarboxylation of isocitrate into alpha-ketoglutarate and co2 and is present in  organisms spanning the biological range of temperature. we have solved two crystal structures of the thermophilic clostridium thermocellum idh (ctidh), a native open apo ctidh to 2.35 a and a quaternary complex of ctidh with nadp(+), isocitrate and mg(2+) to 2.5 a. to compare to these a quaternary complex structure of the psychrophilic desulfotalea psychrophila idh (dpidh) was also resolved to 1.93 a. ctidh and dpidh showed similar global thermal stabilities with melting temperatures of 67.9 and 66.9 degrees c, respectively. ctidh represents a typical thermophilic enzyme, with a large number of ionic interactions and hydrogen bonds per residue combined with stabilization of the n  and c termini. ctidh had a higher activity temperature optimum, and showed greater affinity for the substrates with an active site that was less thermolabile compared to dpidh. the uncompensated negative surface charge and the enlarged methionine cluster in the hinge region both of which are important for cold activity in dpidh, were absent in ctidh. these structural comparisons revealed that prokaryotic idhs in subfamily ii have a unique locking mechanism involving arg310, asp251' and arg255 (ctidh). these interactions lock the large domain to the small domain and direct nadp(+) into the correct orientation, which together are important for nadp(+) selectivity.

TI  == enhanced soluble expression of a thermostable cellulase from clostridium thermocellum in escherichia coli.
AB  == in this study, the cellulase gene celd from clostridium thermocellum was cloned into expression vectors pet-20b(+) and phsh. while high expression can be achieved by means of both these expression systems, only the phsh expression system gives soluble proteins. by weakening the mrna secondary structure and replacing the rare codons for the n-terminal amino acids of the target protein, the expression level of celd was increased from 4.1 +/- 0.3 to 6.4 +/- 0.4 u ml(-1) in lb medium. recombinant celd was purified by heat treatment followed by  ni-nta affinity. the purified celd exhibited the highest activity at ph 5.4 and 60 degrees c, and retained more than 50% activity after incubation at 70 degrees  c for 1 h. the cellulase activity of celd was significantly enhanced by ca(2+) but inhibited by edta. the favorable properties of celd offer the potential for genetic modification of strains for biomass degradation. presently, one of the major bottlenecks for industrial cellulase users is the high cost of enzyme production. the high level expression of soluble enzymes from the phsh expression system offers a novel approach for the production of cellulases to be used in various agro-industrial processes such as chemical, food and textile.

TI  == construction and characterization of a fusion beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase to improve hydrolytic activity and thermostability.
AB  == a new fusion gene (bgl-licmb), encoding beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase both from bacillus amyloliquefaciens (bgl) and clostridium thermocellum (licmb), was constructed via end-to-end fusion and expressed in escherichia coli to improve hydrolytic activity and thermostability of beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase. the results of enzymatic  properties showed that the catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/k(m)) of the fusion enzyme for oat beta-glucan was 2.7 and 20-fold higher than that of the parental bgl and licmb, respectively, and that the fusion enzyme can retain more than 50%  of activity following incubation at 80 degrees c for 30 min, whereas the residual activities of bgl and licmb were both less than 30%. these properties make this particular beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase a good candidate for application in brewing and animal-feed industries.

TI  == expression of family 3 cellulose-binding module (cbm3) as an affinity tag for recombinant proteins in yeast.
AB  == easy and low-cost protein purification methods for the mass production of commonly used enzymes that play important roles in biotechnology are in high demand. in this study, we developed a fast, low-cost recombinant protein purification system in the methylotrophic yeast pichia pastoris using the family  3 cellulose-binding module (cbm3)-based affinity tag. the codon of the cbm3 gene  from clostridium thermocellum was optimized based on the codon usage of p. pastoris. the cbm3 tag was then fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein (cbm3-egfp) or with inulinase and expressed in p. pastoris to demonstrate its ability to function as an affinity tag in a yeast expression system. we also examined the effects of glycosylation on the secreted cbm3-tag. the secreted wild-type cbm3-egfp was glycosylated; however, this had little influence on the adsorption of the fusion protein to the regenerated amorphous cellulose (rac; maximum adsorption capacity of 319 mg/g). two cbm3-egfp mutants lacking glycosylation sites were also constructed. the three cbm3-egfps expressed in p. pastoris and the cbm3-egfp expressed in escherichia coli all had similar rac adsorption capacity. to construct a tag-free recombinant protein purification system based on cbm3, a cbm3-intein-egfp fusion protein was expressed in p. pastoris. this fusion protein was stably expressed and the self-cleavage of intein was efficiently induced by dtt or l: -cysteine. in this study, we were able to purify the recombinant fusion protein with high efficiency using both intein and direct fusion-based strategies.

TI  == isolation and characterization of a new cellulosome-producing clostridium thermocellum strain.
AB  == the anaerobic thermophilic bacterium, clostridium thermocellum, is a potent cellulolytic microorganism that produces large extracellular multienzyme complexes called cellulosomes. to isolate c. thermocellum organisms that possess  effective cellulose-degrading ability, new thermophilic cellulolytic strains were screened from more than 800 samples obtained mainly from agriculture residues in  thailand using microcrystalline cellulose as a carbon source. a new strain, c. thermocellum s14, having high cellulose-degrading ability was isolated from bagasse paper sludge. cellulosomes prepared from s14 demonstrated faster degradation of microcrystalline cellulose, and 3.4- and 5.6-fold greater avicelase activity than those from c. thermocellum atcc27405 and jw20 (atcc31449), respectively. scanning electron microscopic analysis showed that s14 had unique cell surface features with few protuberances in contrast to the type strains. in addition, the cellulosome of s14 was resistant to inhibition by cellobiose that is a major end product of cellulose hydrolysis. saccharification  tests conducted using rice straw soaked with sodium hydroxide indicated the cellulosome of s14 released approximately 1.5-fold more total sugars compared to  that of atcc27405. this newly isolated s14 strain has the potential as an enzyme  resource for effective lignocellulose degradation.

TI  == ultra-stable phosphoglucose isomerase through immobilization of cellulose-binding module-tagged thermophilic enzyme on low-cost high-capacity cellulosic adsorbent.
AB  == one-step enzyme purification and immobilization were developed based on simple adsorption of a family 3 cellulose-binding module (cbm)-tagged protein on the external surface of high-capacity regenerated amorphous cellulose (rac). an open  reading frame (orf) cthe0217 encoding a putative phosphoglucose isomerase (pgi, ec 5.3.1.9) from a thermophilic bacterium clostridium thermocellum was cloned and the recombinant proteins with or without cbm were over-expressed in escherichia coli. the rate constant (kcat ) and michaelis-menten constant (km ) of cbm-free pgi at 60 degrees c were 2,765 s(-1) and 2.89 mm, respectively. pgi was stable at a high protein concentration of 0.1 g/l but deactivated rapidly at low concentrations. immobilized cbm (icbm)-pgi on rac was extremely stable at approximately 60 degrees c, nearly independent of its mass concentration in bulk  solution, because its local concentration on the solid support was constant. icbm-pgi at a low concentration of 0.001 g/l had a half-life time of 190 h, approximately 80-fold of that of free pgi. total turn-over number of icbm-pgi was as high as 1.1x10(9) mole of product per mole of enzyme at 60 degrees c. these results suggest that a combination of low-cost enzyme immobilization and thermoenzyme led to an ultra-stable enzyme building block suitable for cell-free  synthetic pathway biotransformation that can implement complicated biochemical reactions in vitro.

TI  == assembly of minicellulosomes on the surface of bacillus subtilis.
AB  == to cost-efficiently produce biofuels, new methods are needed to convert lignocellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars. one promising approach is to degrade biomass using cellulosomes, which are surface-displayed multicellulase-containing complexes present in cellulolytic clostridium and ruminococcus species. in this study we created cellulolytic strains of bacillus subtilis that display one or more cellulase enzymes. proteins containing the appropriate cell wall sorting signal are covalently anchored to the peptidoglycan by coexpressing them with the bacillus anthracis sortase a (srta) transpeptidase. this approach was used to covalently attach the cel8a endoglucanase from clostridium thermocellum to the cell wall. in addition, a cel8a-dockerin fusion protein was anchored on the surface of b. subtilis via noncovalent interactions with a cell wall-attached cohesin module. we also demonstrate that it is possible to assemble multienzyme complexes on the cell surface. a three-enzyme-containing  minicellulosome was displayed on the cell surface; it consisted of a cell wall-attached scaffoldin protein noncovalently bound to three cellulase-dockerin  fusion proteins that were produced in escherichia coli. b. subtilis has a robust  genetic system and is currently used in a wide range of industrial processes. thus, grafting larger, more elaborate minicellulosomes onto the surface of b. subtilis may yield cellulolytic bacteria with increased potency that can be used  to degrade biomass.

TI  == [transgenic tomato plants expressing reca and nls-reca-licbm3 genes as a model for studying meiotic recombination].
AB  == homologous dna recombination in eukaryotes is necessary to maintain genome stability and integrity and for correct chromosome segregation and formation of new haplotypes in meiosis. at the same time, genetic determination and nonrandomness of meiotic recombination restrict the introgression of genes and generation of unique genotypes. as one of the approaches to study and induce meiotic recombination in plants, it is recommended to use the reca gene of escherichia coli. it is shown that the reca and nls-reca-licbm3 genes have maternal inheritance and are expressed in the progeny of transgenic tomato plants. plants expressing reca or nls-reca-licbm3 and containing one t-dna insertion do not differ in pollen fertility from original nontransgenic forms and can therefore be used for comparative studies of the effect of bacterial recombinases on meiotic recombination between linked genes.

TI  == the role of carbohydrate-binding module (cbm) repeat of a multimodular xylanase (xynx) from clostridium thermocellum in cellulose and xylan binding.
AB  == a non-cellulosomal xylanase from clostridium thermocellum, xynx, consists of a family-22 carbohydratebinding module (cbm22), a family-10 glycoside hydrolase (gh10) catalytic module, two family-9 carbohydrate-binding modules (cbm9-i and cbm9-ii), and an s-layer homology (slh) module. e. coli bl21(de3) (pkm29), a transformant carrying xynx', produced several truncated forms of the enzyme. among them, three major active species were purified by sds-page, activity staining, gel-slicing, and diffusion from the gel. the truncated xylanases were different from each other only in their c-terminal regions. in addition to the cbm22 and gh10 catalytic modules, xynx(1) had the cbm9-i and most of the cbm9-ii, xynx(2) had the cbm9-i and about 40% of the cbm9-ii, and xynx(3) had about 75% of the cbm9-i. the truncated xylanases showed higher binding capacities toward avicel than those toward insoluble xylan. xynx(1) showed a higher affinity toward avicel (70.5%) than xynx(2) (46.0%) and xynx(3) (42.1%); however, there were no significant differences in the affinities toward insoluble xylan. it is suggested that the cbm9 repeat, especially cbm9-ii, of xynx plays a role in xylan degradation in nature by strengthening cellulose binding rather than by enhancing xylan binding.

TI  == characterization of a dockerin-based affinity tag: application for purification of a broad variety of target proteins.
AB  == cellulose, a major component of plant matter, is degraded by a cell surface multiprotein complex called the cellulosome produced by several anaerobic bacteria. this complex coordinates the assembly of different glycoside hydrolases, via a high-affinity ca(2+)-dependent interaction between the enzyme-borne dockerin and the scaffoldin-borne cohesin modules. in this study, we characterized a new protein affinity tag, deltadoc, a truncated version (48 residues) of the clostridium thermocellum cel48s dockerin. the truncated dockerin tag has a binding affinity (k(a)) of 7.7 x 10(8)m(-1), calculated by a competitive enzyme-linked assay system. in order to examine whether the tag can be used for general application in affinity chromatography, it was fused to a range of target proteins, including aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (gfp), c. thermocellum beta-glucosidase, escherichia coli thioesterase/protease i (tep1), and the antibody-binding zz-domain from staphylococcus aureus protein a.  the results of this study significantly extend initial studies performed using the geobacillus stearothermophilus xylanase t-6 as a model system. in addition, the enzymatic activity of a c. thermocellum beta-glucosidase, purified using this approach, was tested and found to be similar to that of a beta-glucosidase preparation (without the deltadoc tag) purified using the standard his-tag. the truncated dockerin derivative functioned as an effective affinity tag through specific interaction with a cognate cohesin, and highly purified target proteins  were obtained in a single step directly from crude cell extracts. the relatively  inexpensive beaded cellulose-based affinity column was reusable and maintained high capacity after each cycle. this study demonstrates that deletion into the first ca(2+)-binding loop of the dockerin module results in an efficient and robust affinity tag that can be generally applied for protein purification.

AB  == a substrate specificity study of the recombinant d-ribose-5-phosphate isomerase (rpib) from clostridium thermocellum was performed. among all aldopentoses and aldohexoses, the rpib enzyme displayed activity with l-talose, d-ribose, d-allose, l-allose, l-ribose, and d-talose in decreasing order. the products released were l-tagatose, d-ribulose, d-psicose, l-psicose, l-ribulose, and d-tagatose, respectively. the enzyme showed specificity for aldose substrates possessing hydroxyl groups oriented in the same direction at the c2, c3, and c4 positions. molecular modeling of the enzyme suggests that the novel substrate specificity may be explained by substrate interactions with residues tyr42, his98, and his9, which interact with the hydroxyl groups of c2, c3, and c4, respectively, oriented in the same direction. l-talose and d-ribulose exhibited the highest activity among the aldoses and ketoses, respectively. ribose 5-phosphate isomerase catalyzed the conversion of l-talose to l-tagatose with an  89% conversion yield after approximately 90 min, while d-ribulose was converted to d-ribose with a 38% conversion yield.

TI  == bacterial cmp-sialic acid synthetases: production, properties, and applications.
AB  == sialic acids are abundant nine-carbon sugars expressed terminally on glycoconjugates of eukaryotic cells and are crucial for a variety of cell biological functions such as cell-cell adhesion, intracellular signaling, and in  regulation of glycoproteins stability. in bacteria, n-acetylneuraminic acid (neu5ac) polymers are important virulence factors. cytidine 5'-monophosphate (cmp)-n-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase (css; ec 2.7.7.43), the key enzyme that  synthesizes cmp-n-acetylneuraminic acid, the donor molecule for numerous sialyltransferase reactions, is present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotic systems. herein, we emphasize the source, function, and biotechnological applications of css enzymes from bacterial sources. to date, only a few css from  pathogenic bacterial species such as neisseria meningitidis, escherichia coli, group b streptococci, haemophilus ducreyi, and pasteurella hemolytica and an enzyme from nonpathogenic bacterium, clostridium thermocellum, have been described. overall, the enzymes from both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria share common catalytic properties such as their dependency on divalent cation, temperature and ph profiles, and catalytic mechanisms. the enzymes, however, can be categorized as smaller and larger enzymes depending on their molecular weight. the larger enzymes in some cases are bifunctional; they have exhibited acetylhydrolase activity in addition to their sugar nucleotidyltransferase activity. the csss are important enzymes for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of various sialooligosaccharides of significance in biotechnology.

TI  == molecular characterization of polychlorinated biphenyl-dechlorinating populations in contaminated sediments.
AB  == polychlorinated biphenyl (pcb)-dechlorinating microorganisms were characterized in pcb-contaminated sediments using amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis  (ardra). the sediments were prepared by spiking aroclor 1248 into pcb-free sediments, and were inoculated with microorganisms eluted from st. lawrence river sediments. pcb-free sediments inoculated with the same inoculum served as the control. four restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) groups in the eubacterial and two in the archaeal domain were found exclusively in pcb-spiked sediment clone libraries. sequence analysis of the four eubacterial clones showed homology to escherichia coli, lactosphaera pasteurii, clostridium thermocellum, and dehalobacter restrictus. the predominant archaeal sequence in the pcb-spiked  sediment clone library was closely related to methanosarcina barkeri, which appear to support earlier findings that methanogens are involved in pcb dechlorination. when the dot-blot hybridization was performed between the sediment dna extract and the probes designed with eubacterial rflp groups, the intensity of two of eubacterial rflp groups, which showed high sequence homology  to c. pascui and d. restrictus, was highly correlated with the number of dechlorinating microorganisms suggesting these two members intend to contribute to pcb dechlorination.

TI  == escherichia coli expression and purification of four antimicrobial peptides fused to a family 3 carbohydrate-binding module (cbm) from clostridium thermocellum.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides (amps) are molecules that act in a wide range of physiological defensive mechanisms developed to counteract bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses. several hundreds of amps have been identified and characterized. these molecules are presently gaining increasing importance, as a  consequence of their remarkable resistance to microorganism adaptation. carbohydrate-binding modules (cbms) are non-catalytic domains that anchor glycoside hydrolases into complex carbohydrates. clostridium thermocellum produces a multi-enzyme complex of cellulases and hemicellulases, termed the cellulosome, which is organized by the scaffoldin protein cipa. binding of the cellulosome to the plant cell wall results from the action of cipa family 3 cbm (cbm3), which presents a high affinity for crystalline cellulose. here cipa family 3 cbm was fused to four different amps using recombinant dna technology and the fusion recombinant proteins were expressed at high levels in escherichia  coli cells. cbm3 does not present antibacterial activity and does not bind to the bacterial surface. however, the four recombinant proteins retained the ability to bind cellulose, suggesting that cbm3 is a good candidate polypeptide to direct the binding of amps into cellulosic supports. a comprehensive characterization of the antimicrobial activity of the recombinant fusion proteins is currently under  evaluation.

TI  == functional asymmetry in cohesin binding belies inherent symmetry of the dockerin  module: insight into cellulosome assembly revealed by systematic mutagenesis.
AB  == the cellulosome is an intricate multi-enzyme complex, known for its efficient degradation of recalcitrant cellulosic substrates. its supramolecular architecture is determined by the high-affinity intermodular cohesin-dockerin interaction. the dockerin module comprises a calcium-binding, duplicated 'f-hand' loop-helix motif that bears striking similarity to the ef-hand loop-helix-loop motif of eukaryotic calcium-binding proteins. in the present study, we demonstrate by progressive truncation and alanine scanning of a representative type-i dockerin module from clostridium thermocellum, that only one of the repeated motifs is critical for high-affinity cohesin binding. the results suggest that the near-symmetry in sequence and structure of the repeated elements of the dockerin is not essential to cohesin binding. the first calcium-binding loop can be deleted entirely, with almost full retention of binding. likewise, significant deletion of the second repeated segment can be achieved, provided that its calcium-binding loop remains intact. essentially the same conclusion was verified by systematically mutating the highly conserved residues in the calcium-binding loop. mutations in one of the calcium-binding loops failed to disrupt cohesin recognition and binding, whereas a single mutation in both loops  served to reduce the affinity significantly. the results are mutually compatible  with recent crystal structures of the type-i cohesin-dockerin heterodimer, which  demonstrate that the dockerin can bind in an equivalent manner to its cohesin counterpart through either its first or second repeated motif. the observed plasticity in cohesin-dockerin binding may facilitate cellulosome assembly in vivo or, alternatively, provide a conformational switch that promotes access of the tethered cellulosomal enzymes to their polysaccharide substrates.

TI  == induction of the celc operon of clostridium thermocellum by laminaribiose.
AB  == clostridium thermocellum is an anaerobic, thermophilic, cellulolytic, and ethanogenic bacterium. it produces an extracellular multiprotein complex termed the cellulosome, which consists of >70 subunits, most of them glycosyl hydrolases. it also produces many free glycosyl hydrolases. how the organism commands such a large number of genes and proteins for biomass degradation is an  intriguing yet unresolved question. we identified glyr3, which is cotranscribed with the cellulase/hemicellulase genes celc and lica, as a potential cellulase transcription regulator. the gel-shift assay (emsa) revealed that the recombinant glyr3 bound specifically to the celc promoter region. glyr3 was also identified from the lysate of the lichenan-grown cells, which bound to the same sequence. dnase i footprinting and competitive emsa showed the binding site to be an 18-bp  palindromic sequence with one mismatch. the dna-binding activity was specifically inhibited by laminaribiose, a beta-1-3 linked glucose dimer, in a dose-dependent  manner. in in vitro transcription analysis, celc expression was repressed by rglyr3 in a dose-dependent manner. the repression was relieved by laminaribiose,  also in a dose-dependent manner. these results indicate that glyr3 is a negative  regulator of the celc operon consisting of celc, glyr3, and lica, and inducible by laminaribiose. thus, the bacterium may modulate the biosynthesis of its enzyme components to optimize its activity on an available biomass substrate, in this case, beta-1-3 glucan, because both celc and lica are active on the substrate. the results further indicate that, despite the insolubility of the biomass substrate, regulation of the degradative enzymes can be accomplished through soluble sugars generated by the action of the enzymes.

TI  == two noncellulosomal cellulases of clostridium thermocellum, cel9i and cel48y, hydrolyse crystalline cellulose synergistically.
AB  == the genome of clostridium thermocellum contains a number of genes for polysaccharide degradation-associated proteins that are not cellulosome bound. the list includes beta-glucanases, glycosidases, chitinases, amylases and a xylanase. one of these 'soluble'-enzyme genes codes for a second glycosyl hydrolase (gh)48 cellulase, cel48y, which was expressed in escherichia coli and biochemically characterized. it is a cellobiohydrolyse with activity on native cellulose such as microcrystalline and bacterial cellulose, and low activity on carboxymethylcellulose. it is about 100 times as active on amorphic cellulose and mixed-linkage barley beta-glucan compared with cellulase cel9i. the enzyme cel48y shows a distinct synergism of 2.1 times with the noncellulosomal processive endoglucanase cel9i on highly crystalline bacterial cellulose at a 17-fold excess of cel48y over cel9i. these data show that c. thermocellum has, besides the cellulosome, the genes for a second cellulase system for the hydrolysis of crystalline cellulose that is not particle bound.

TI  == characterization of an exo-beta-1,3-galactanase from clostridium thermocellum.
AB  == a gene encoding an exo-beta-1,3-galactanase from clostridium thermocellum, ct1,3gal43a, was isolated. the sequence has similarity with an exo-beta-1,3-galactanase of phanerochaete chrysosporium (pc1,3gal43a). the gene encodes a modular protein consisting of an n-terminal glycoside hydrolase family  43 (gh43) module, a family 13 carbohydrate-binding module (cbm13), and a c-terminal dockerin domain. the gene corresponding to the gh43 module was expressed in escherichia coli, and the gene product was characterized. the recombinant enzyme shows optimal activity at ph 6.0 and 50 degrees c and catalyzes hydrolysis only of beta-1,3-linked galactosyl oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of the hydrolysis products demonstrated that the enzyme produces galactose from beta-1,3-galactan in an exo-acting manner. when the enzyme acted on arabinogalactan proteins (agps), the enzyme produced oligosaccharides together with galactose, suggesting that the enzyme is able to accommodate a beta-1,6-linked galactosyl side chain. the substrate specificity of the enzyme is very similar to that of pc1,3gal43a, suggesting that the enzyme is an exo-beta-1,3-galactanase. affinity gel electrophoresis of the c-terminal cbm13 did not show any affinity for polysaccharides, including beta-1,3-galactan. however, frontal affinity chromatography for the cbm13 indicated that the cbm13 specifically interacts with oligosaccharides containing a beta-1,3-galactobiose,  beta-1,4-galactosyl glucose, or beta-1,4-galactosyl n-acetylglucosaminide moiety  at the nonreducing end. interestingly, cbm13 in the c terminus of ct1,3gal43a appeared to interfere with the enzyme activity toward beta-1,3-galactan and alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase-treated agp.

TI  == structure and activity of two metal ion-dependent acetylxylan esterases involved  in plant cell wall degradation reveals a close similarity to peptidoglycan deacetylases.
AB  == the enzymatic degradation of plant cell wall xylan requires the concerted action  of a diverse enzymatic syndicate. among these enzymes are xylan esterases, which  hydrolyze the o-acetyl substituents, primarily at the o-2 position of the xylan backbone. all acetylxylan esterase structures described previously display a alpha/beta hydrolase fold with a "ser-his-asp" catalytic triad. here we report the structures of two distinct acetylxylan esterases, those from streptomyces lividans and clostridium thermocellum, in native and complex forms, with x-ray data to between 1.6 and 1.0 a resolution. we show, using a novel linked assay system with pnp-2-o-acetylxyloside and a beta-xylosidase, that the enzymes are sugar-specific and metal ion-dependent and possess a single metal center with a chemical preference for co2+. asp and his side chains complete the catalytic machinery. different metal ion preferences for the two enzymes may reflect the surprising diversity with which the metal ion coordinates residues and ligands in the active center environment of the s. lividans and c. thermocellum enzymes. these "ce4" esterases involved in plant cell wall degradation are shown to be closely related to the de-n-acetylases involved in chitin and peptidoglycan degradation (blair, d. e., schuettelkopf, a. w., macrae, j. i., and aalten, d. m.

TI  == improving solubility of shewanella oneidensis mr-1 and clostridium thermocellum jw-20 proteins expressed into esherichia coli.
AB  == low solubility of proteins overexpressed in e. coli is a frequent problem in high-throughput structural genomics. to improve solubility of proteins from mesophilic shewanella oneidensis mr-1 and thermophilic clostridium thermocellum jw20, an approach was attempted that included a fusion of the target protein to a maltose-binding protein (mbp) and a decrease of induction temperature. the mbp was selected as the most efficient solubilizing carrier when compared to a glutathione s-transferase and a nus a protein. a tobacco etch virus (tev) protease recognition site was introduced between fused proteins using a double polymerase-chain reaction and four primers. in this way, 79 s. oneidensis proteins have been expressed in one case with an n-terminal 30-residue tag and in another case as a fusion protein with mbp. a foreign tag might significantly affect the properties of the target polypeptide. at 37 degrees c and 18 degrees c induction temperatures, only 5 and 17 tagged proteins were soluble, respectively. in fusion with mbp 4, 34, and 38 proteins were soluble upon induction at 37 degrees, 28 degrees, and 18 degrees c, respectively. the mbp is assumed to increase stability and solubility of a target protein by changing both the mechanism and the cooperativity of folding/unfolding. the 66 c. thermocellum proteins were expressed as fusion proteins with mbp. induction at 37 degrees, 28  degrees, and 18 degrees c produced 34, 57, and 60 soluble proteins, respectively. the higher solubility of c. thermocellum proteins in comparison with the s. oneidensis proteins under similar conditions of induction correlates with the thermophilicity of the host. the two-factor wilkinson-harrison statistical model  was used to identify soluble and insoluble proteins. theoretical and experimental data showed good agreement for s. oneidensis proteins; however, the model failed  to identify soluble/insoluble clostridium proteins. a suggestion has been made that the wilkinson-harrison model is not applicable to c. thermocellum proteins because it did not account for the peculiarities of protein sequences from thermophiles.

TI  == xyloglucan is recognized by carbohydrate-binding modules that interact with beta-glucan chains.
AB  == enzyme systems that attack the plant cell wall contain noncatalytic carbohydrate-binding modules (cbms) that mediate attachment to this composite structure and play a pivotal role in maximizing the hydrolytic process. although  xyloglucan, which includes a backbone of beta-1,4-glucan decorated primarily with xylose residues, is a key component of the plant cell wall, cbms that bind to this polymer have not been identified. here we showed that the c-terminal domain  of the modular clostridium thermocellum enzyme ctcel9d-cel44a (formerly known as  celj) comprises a novel cbm (designated cbm44) that binds with equal affinity to  cellulose and xyloglucan. we also showed that accommodation of xyloglucan side chains is a general feature of cbms that bind to single cellulose chains. the crystal structures of cbm44 and the other cbm (cbm30) in ctcel9d-cel44a display a beta-sandwich fold. the concave face of both cbms contains a hydrophobic platform comprising three tryptophan residues that can accommodate up to five glucose residues. the orientation of these aromatic residues is such that the bound ligand would adopt the twisted conformation displayed by cello-oligosaccharides in solution. mutagenesis studies confirmed that the hydrophobic platform located  on the concave face of both cbms mediates ligand recognition. in contrast to other cbms that bind to single polysaccharide chains, the polar residues in the binding cleft of cbm44 play only a minor role in ligand recognition. the mechanism by which these proteins are able to recognize linear and decorated beta-1,4-glucans is discussed based on the structures of cbm44 and the other cbms that bind single cellulose chains.

TI  == how family 26 glycoside hydrolases orchestrate catalysis on different polysaccharides: structure and activity of a clostridium thermocellum lichenase,  ctlic26a.
AB  == one of the most intriguing features of the 90 glycoside hydrolase families (ghs)  is the range of specificities displayed by different members of the same family,  whereas the catalytic apparatus and mechanism are often invariant. family gh26 predominantly comprises beta-1,4 mannanases; however, a bifunctional clostridium  thermocellum gh26 member (hereafter ctlic26a) displays a markedly different specificity. we show that ctlic26a is a lichenase, specific for mixed (glcbeta1,4glcbeta1,4glcbeta1,3)n oligo- and polysaccharides, and displays no activity on manno-configured substrates or beta-1,4-linked homopolymers of glucose or xylose. the three-dimensional structure of the native form of ctlic26a has been solved at 1.50-a resolution, revealing a characteristic (beta/alpha)8 barrel with glu-109 and glu-222 acting as the catalytic acid/base and nucleophile in a double-displacement mechanism. the complex with the competitive inhibitor, glc-beta-1,3-isofagomine (ki 1 microm), at 1.60 a sheds light on substrate recognition in the -2 and -1 subsites and illuminates why the enzyme is specific  for lichenan-based substrates. hydrolysis of beta-mannosides by gh26 members is thought to proceed through transition states in the b2,5 (boat) conformation in which structural distinction of glucosides versus mannosides reflects not the configuration at c2 but the recognition of the pseudoaxial o3 of the b2,5 conformation. we suggest a different conformational itinerary for the gh26 enzymes active on gluco-configured substrates.

AB  == clostridium thermocellum xylanase xyn10c (formerly xync) is a modular enzyme, comprising a family-22 carbohydrate-binding module (cbm), a family-10 catalytic module of the glycoside hydrolases, and a dockerin module responsible for cellulosome assembly consecutively from the n-terminus. to study the functions of the cbm, truncated derivatives of xyn10c were constructed: a recombinant catalytic module polypeptide (rcm), a family-22 cbm polypeptide (rcbm), and a polypeptide composed of the family-22 cbm and cm (rcbm-cm). the recombinant proteins were characterized by enzyme and binding assays. although the catalytic  activity of rcbm-cm toward insoluble xylan was four times higher than that of rcm toward the same substrate, removal of the cbm did not severely affect catalytic activity toward soluble xylan or beta-1,3-1,4-glucan. rcbm showed an affinity for amorphous celluloses and insoluble and soluble xylan in qualitative binding assays. the optimum temperature of rcbm-cm was 80 degrees c and that of rcm was 60 degrees c. these results indicate that the family-22 cbm of c. thermocellum xyn10c not only was responsible for the binding of the enzyme to the substrates,  but also contributes to the stability of the cm in the presence of the substrate  at high temperatures.

TI  == cloning and expression of the clostridium thermocellum l-lactate dehydrogenase gene in escherichia coli and enzyme characterization.
AB  == the structural gene for l-lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) (ec.1.1.1.27) from clostridium thermocellum 27405 was cloned in escherichia coli by screening the lambda zap ii phage library of c. thermocellum genomic dna. in one positive clone, an open reading frame of 948 base pairs corresponded to c. thermocellum ldh gene encoding for the predicted 315-residue protein. the ldh gene was successfully expressed in e. coli fmj39 (ldh mutant) under the lac promoter. the  recombinant enzyme was partially purified from e. coli cell extracts and its kinetic properties were determined. clostridium thermocellum ldh was shown to catalyze a highly reversible reaction and to be an allosteric enzyme that is activated by fructose-1,6-diphosphate (fdp). for pyruvate, partially purified ldh had km and vmax values of 7.3 mmol/l and 87 micromol/min, respectively, and in the presence of fdp, a 24-fold decrease in km and a 5.7-fold increase in vmax were recorded. the enzyme exhibited no marked catalytic activity for lactate in the absence of fdp, whereas km and vmax values were 59.5 mmol/l and 52 micromol/min, respectively, in its presence. the enzyme did not lose activity when incubated at 65 degrees c for 5 min.

TI  == expression, purification and structural characterization of the scaffoldin hydrophilic x-module from the cellulosome of clostridium thermocellum.
AB  == the cellulosome is a membrane-bound, extracellular multi-subunit complex responsible for the degradation of crystalline cellulose by a number of organisms including anaerobic bacteria and fungi. the hydrophilic x-module (cipa-x) from the modular scaffoldin subunit of clostridium thermocellum cellulosome has been proposed to play various roles in cellulosomal function, including thermal and structural stability. towards elucidating the function of cipa-x using structural and biophysical studies, the region comprising residues 1692-1785 from the c. thermocellum cipa cdna encoding cipa-x was cloned into a pet21b expression vector. when expressed in escherichia coli, the c-terminal his-tagged protein accumulated in the insoluble fraction. cell fractionation experiments showed that the recombinant protein was localized to inclusion bodies. refolding and purification involved denaturation of the whole cell lysate by addition of urea,  followed by a nickel-sepharose chromatography step and dialysis into native conditions (25 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.4, 50 mm nacl, and 10 mm edta). a final gel filtration step purified the protein to homogeneity, yielding 40 mg/l. the two-dimensional 1h-15n correlation spectrum of uniformly 15n-labelled cipa-x showed the characteristics of a well-folded protein comprising significant beta-structure, which is in agreement with the circular dichroism data.

TI  == protein splicing and auto-cleavage of bacterial intein-like domains lacking a c'-flanking nucleophilic residue.
AB  == bacterial intein-like (bil) domains are newly identified homologs of intein protein-splicing domains. the two known types of bil domains together with inteins and hedgehog (hog) auto-processing domains form the hog/intein (hint) superfamily. bil domains are distinct from inteins and hogs in sequence, phylogenetic distribution, and host protein type, but little is known about their biochemical activity. here we experimentally study the auto-processing activity of four bil domains. an a-type bil domain from clostridium thermocellum showed both protein-splicing and auto-cleavage activities. the splicing is notable, because this domain has a native ala c'-flanking residue rather than a nucleophilic residue, which is absolutely necessary for intein protein splicing.  b-type bil domains from rhodobacter sphaeroides and rhodobacter capsulatus cleaved their n' or c' ends. we propose an alternative protein-splicing mechanism for the a-type bil domains. after an initial n-s acyl shift, creating a thioester bond at the n' end of the domain, the c' end of the domain is cleaved by asn cyclization. the resulting amino end of the c'-flank attacks the thioester bond next at the n' end of the domain. this aminolysis step splices the two flanks of  the domain. the b-type bil domain cleavage activity is explained in the context of the canonical intein protein-splicing mechanism. our results suggest that the  different hint domains have related biochemical activities of proteolytic cleavages, ligation and splicing. yet the predominant reactions diverged in each  hint type according to their specific biological roles. we suggest that the bil domain cleavage and splicing reactions are mechanisms for post-translationally generating protein variability, particularly in extracellular bacterial proteins.

TI  == electrotransformation of clostridium thermocellum.
AB  == electrotransformation of several strains of clostridium thermocellum was achieved using plasmid pikm1 with selection based on resistance to erythromycin and lincomycin. a custom-built pulse generator was used to apply a square 10-ms pulse to an electrotransformation cuvette consisting of a modified centrifuge tube. transformation was verified by recovery of the shuttle plasmid pikm1 from presumptive transformants of c. thermocellum with subsequent pcr specific to the  mls gene on the plasmid, as well as by retransformation of escherichia coli. optimization carried out with strain dsm 1313 increased transformation efficiencies from <1 to (2.2 +/- 0.5) x 10(5) transformants per micro g of plasmid dna. factors conducive to achieving high transformation efficiencies included optimized periods of incubation both before and after electric pulse application, chilling during cell collection and washing, subculture in the presence of isoniacin prior to electric pulse application, a custom-built cuvette embedded in an ice block during pulse application, use of a high (25-kv/cm) field strength, and induction of the mls gene before plating the cells on selective medium. the protocol and preferred conditions developed for strain dsm 1313 resulted in transformation efficiencies of (5.0 +/- 1.8) x 10(4) transformants per micro g of plasmid dna for strain atcc 27405 and approximately 1 x 10(3) transformants per micro g of plasmid dna for strains dsm 4150 and 7072. cell viability under optimal conditions was approximately 50% of that of controls not  exposed to an electrical pulse. dam methylation had a beneficial but modest (7-fold for strain atcc 27405; 40-fold for strain dsm 1313) effect on transformation efficiency. the effect of isoniacin was also strain specific. the  results reported here provide for the first time a gene transfer method functional in c. thermocellum that is suitable for molecular manipulations involving either the introduction of genes associated with foreign gene products  or knockout of native genes.

TI  == cohesin-dockerin interactions within and between clostridium josui and clostridium thermocellum: binding selectivity between cognate dockerin and cohesin domains and species specificity.
AB  == the cellulosome components are assembled into the cellulosome complex by the interaction between one of the repeated cohesin domains of a scaffolding protein  and the dockerin domain of an enzyme component. we prepared five recombinant cohesin polypeptides of the clostridium thermocellum scaffolding protein cipa, two dockerin polypeptides of c. thermocellum xyn11a and xyn10c, four cohesin polypeptides of clostridium josui cipa, and two dockerin polypeptides of c. josui aga27a and cel8a, and qualitatively and quantitatively examined the cohesin-dockerin interactions within c. thermocellum and c. josui, respectively,  and the species specificity of the cohesin-dockerin interactions between these two bacteria. surface plasmon resonance (spr) analysis indicated that there was a certain selectivity, with a maximal 34-fold difference in the k(d) values, in the cohesin-dockerin interactions within a combination of c. josui, although this was not detected by qualitative analysis. affinity blotting analysis suggested that there was at least one exception to the species specificity in the cohesin-dockerin interactions, although species specificity was generally conserved among the cohesin and dockerin polypeptides from c. thermocellum and c. josui, i.e. the dockerin polypeptides of c. thermocellum xyn11a exceptionally bound to the cohesin polypeptides from c. josui cipa. spr analysis confirmed this exceptional binding. we discuss the relationship between the species specificity  of the cohesin-dockerin binding and the conserved amino acid residues in the dockerin domains.

TI  == cloning, expression, and cell surface localization of paenibacillus sp. strain w-61 xylanase 5, a multidomain xylanase.
AB  == we have shown that a xylan-degrading bacterium, w-61, excretes multiple xylanases, including xylanase 5 with a molecular mass of 140 kda. here, we emend  the previously used classification of the bacterium (i.e., aeromonas caviae w-61) to paenibacillus sp. strain w-61 on the basis of the nucleotide sequence of the 16s rrna gene, and we clone and express the xyn5 gene encoding xylanase 5 (xyn5)  in escherichia coli and study the subcellular localization of xyn5. xyn5 encodes  1,326 amino acid residues, including a 27-amino-acid signal sequence. sequence analysis indicated that xyn5 comprises two family 22 carbohydrate-binding modules (cbm), a family 10 catalytic domain of glycosyl hydrolases, a family 9 cbm, a domain similar to the lysine-rich region of clostridium thermocellum sdba, and three s-layer-homologous (slh) domains. recombinant xyn5 bound to a crystalline cellulose, avicel ph-101, while an n-terminal 90-kda fragment of xyn5, which lacks the c-terminal half of the family 9 cbm, did not bind to avicel ph-101. xyn5 was cell bound, and the cell-bound protein was digested by exogenous trypsin to produce immunoreactive and xylanolytic fragments with molecular masses of 80 and 60 kda. xyn5 was exclusively distributed in the cell envelope fraction consisting of a peptidoglycan-containing layer and an associated s layer. thus, paenibacillus sp. strain w-61 xyn5 is a cell surface-anchored modular xylanase possessing a functional cellulose-binding module and slh domains. possible cooperative action of multiple xylanases produced by strain w-61 is discussed on  the basis of the modular structure of xyn5.

TI  == lic16a of clostridium thermocellum, a non-cellulosomal, highly complex endo-beta-1,3-glucanase bound to the outer cell surface.
AB  == clostridium thermocellum produces one major beta-1,3-glucanase. genomic dna fragments containing the gene were cloned from two strains, dsm1237(t) (6848 bp)  and f7 (9766 bp). overlapping sequences were 99.9 % identical. the nucleotide sequences contained reading frames for a putative transposase, endo-beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase celc, a putative transcription regulator of the laci  type, beta-1,3-glucanase lic16a and a putative membrane protein. the lica genes of both strains encoded an identical protein of 1324 aa with a calculated molecular mass of 148 kda. lic16a is an unusually complex protein consisting of a leader peptide, a threefold repeat of an s-layer homologous module (slh), an unknown module, a catalytic module of glycosyl hydrolase family 16 and a fourfold repeat of a carbohydrate-binding module of family cbm4a. the recombinant lic16a protein was characterized as an endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase with a specific activity of 2680 and 340 u mg(-1) and a k(m) of 0.94 and 2.1 mg ml(-1) towards barley beta-glucan and laminarin, respectively. it was specific for beta-glucans  containing beta-1,3-linkages with an optimum temperature of 70 degrees c at ph 6.0. the n-terminal slh modules were cleaved from the protein as well in escherichia coli as in c. thermocellum, but nevertheless bound tightly to the rest of the protein. lic16a was located on the cell surface from which it could be purified after fractionated solubilization. its inducible production allowed c. thermocellum to grow on beta-1,3- or beta-1,3-1,4-glucan.

(2001) biosci biotechnol biochem 65:548-554] in pks305. the open reading frame of celt consists of 1,833 nucleotides encoding a protein of 611 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 68,510. the mature form of celt consists of a family 9 cellulase domain and a dockerin domain responsible for cellulosome assembly, but lacks a family 3c carbohydrate-binding module (cbm) and an immunoglobulin (ig)-like domain, which are often found with family 9 catalytic domains. celt devoid of the dockerin domain (celtdeltadoc) was constructed and purified from a recombinant escherichia coli, and its enzyme properties were examined. celtdeltadoc showed strong activity toward carboxymethylcellulose (cmc) and barley beta-glucan, and low activity toward xylan. the v(max) and k(m) values were 137 micro mol min(-1) mg(-1) and 16.7 mg/ml, respectively, for cmc. immunological analysis indicated that celt is a catalytic component of the c. thermocellum f1 cellulosome. this is the first report describing the characterization of a family 9 cellulase without  an ig-like domain or family 3c cbm.

TI  == do domain interactions of glycosyl hydrolases from clostridium thermocellum contribute to protein thermostability?
AB  == cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes usually have a domain composition. the  mutual influence of a cellulose-binding domain and a catalytic domain was investigated with cellobiohydrolase celk and xylanase xynz from clostridium thermocellum. celk is composed of an n-terminal family iv cellulose-binding domain (cbdiv(celk)), a family 9 glycosyl hydrolase domain (gh9(celk)) and a dockerin domain (dd). celk without the dd, (cbdiv-gh9)(celk) and cbdiv(celk) bound cellulose. the thermostability of (cbdiv-gh9)(celk) was significantly higher than that of cbdiv(celk) and gh9(celk). the temperature optima of (cbdiv-gh9)(celk) and gh9(celk) were 65 and 45 degrees c, respectively. xynz consists of an n-terminal feruloyl esterase domain (fae(xynz)), a linker (l), a family vi cbd (cbdvi(xynz)), a dd and a xylanase domain. fae(xynz) and (fae-l-cbdvi)(xynz), used in the present study did not bind cellulose, but both were highly thermostable. replacement of cbdvi(xynz) with cbdiv(celk) resulted in chimeras with feruloyl esterase activity and the ability to bind cellulose. cbdiv(celk)-fae(xynz) bound cellulose with parameters similar to that of (cbdiv-gh9)(celk). (fae-l)(xynz)-cbdiv(celk) and fae(xynz)-cbdiv(celk) had lower  relative affinities and binding capacities than those of (cbdiv-gh9)(celk). the three chimeras were much less thermostable than fae(xynz) and (fae-l-cbdvi)(xynz). the results indicate that domains of glycosyl hydrolases are not randomly combined and that domain interactions affect properties of these domain-structured enzymes.

AB  == the cellulosome of clostridium thermocellum is a multiprotein complex with endo-  and exocellulase, xylanase, beta-glucanase, and acetyl xylan esterase activities. xyny and xynz, components of the cellulosome, are composed of several domains including xylanase domains and domains of unknown function (uds). database searches revealed that the c- and n-terminal uds of xyny and xynz, respectively,  have sequence homology with the sequence of a feruloyl esterase of strain pc-2 of the anaerobic fungus orpinomyces. purified cellulosomes from c. thermocellum were found to hydrolyze faxx (o-(5-o-[(e)-feruloyl]-alpha-l-arabinofuranosyl)-(1-->3)-o-beta-d- xyl opyranosyl-(1-->4)-d-xylopyranose) and fax(3) (5-o-[(e)-feruloyl]-[o-beta-d-xylopyranosyl-(1-->2)]-o-alpha-l- arabinofuranosyl-[1-->3])-o-beta-d-xylopyranosyl-(1-->4)-d-xylopyranose) , yielding ferulic acid as a product, indicating that they have feruloyl esterase activity. nucleotide sequences corresponding to the uds of xyny and xynz were cloned into escherichia coli, and the expressed proteins hydrolyzed faxx and fax(3). the recombinant feruloyl esterase domain of xynz alone (fae(xynz)) and with the adjacent cellulose binding domain (fae-cbd(xynz)) were characterized. fae-cbd(xynz) had a molecular mass of 45 kda that corresponded to the expected product of the 1,203-bp gene. k(m) and v(max) values for fax(3) were 5 mm and 12.5 u/mg, respectively, at ph 6.0 and 60 degrees c. pax(3), a substrate similar  to fax(3) but with a p-coumaroyl group instead of a feruloyl moiety was hydrolyzed at a rate 10 times slower. the recombinant enzyme was active between ph 3 to 10 with an optimum between ph 4 to 7 and at temperatures up to 70 degrees c. treatment of coastal bermuda grass with the enzyme released mainly ferulic acid and a lower amount of p-coumaric acid. fae(xynz) had similar properties. removal of the 40 c-terminal amino acids, residues 247 to 286, of fae(xynz) resulted in protein without activity. feruloyl esterases are believed to aid in a release of lignin from hemicellulose and may be involved in lignin solubilization. the presence of feruloyl esterase in the c. thermocellum cellulosome together with its other hydrolytic activities demonstrates a powerful enzymatic potential of this organelle in plant cell wall decomposition.

TI  == identification of the cellulose-binding domain of fibrobacter succinogenes endoglucanase f.
AB  == the cellulose-binding domain (cbd) of fibrobacter succinogenes endoglucanase f (egf) has been determined. the gene encoding egf (celf) and its derivatives were  expressed in escherichia coli. we were able to obtain eight recombinant proteins  and examine their cellulose-binding ability and endoglucanase activity. because four recombinant proteins, which contain the first n-terminal reiterated region of egf, bound to cellulose, the region has been identified as the cbd. although the cbd did not show significant sequence similarity with any other cbds, it did  show significant similarity with a part of endoglucanase j (celj) of clostridium  thermocellum f1. moreover, a large part of the c-terminal catalytic region of egf showed sequence similarity with alpha-l-arabinofuranosidases of glycosyl hydrolase family 51.

TI  == a family 26 mannanase produced by clostridium thermocellum as a component of the  cellulosome contains a domain which is conserved in mannanases from anaerobic fungi.
AB  == cellulosomes prepared by the cellulose affinity digestion method from clostridium thermocellum culture supernatant hydrolysed carob galactomannan during incubation at 60 degrees c and ph 6.5. a recombinant phage expressing mannanase activity was isolated from a library of c. thermocellum genomic dna constructed in lambdazapii. the cloned fragment of dna containing a putative mannanase gene (mana) was sequenced, revealing an orf of 1767 nt, encoding a protein (mannanase  a; man26a) of 589 aa with a molecular mass of 66816 da. the putative catalytic domain (cd) of man26a, identified by gene sectioning and sequence comparisons, displayed up to 32% identity with other mannanases belonging to family 26. immediately downstream of the cd and separated from it by a short proline/threonine linker was a duplicated 24-residue dockerin motif, which is conserved in all c. thermocellum cellulosomal enzymes described thus far and mediates their attachment to the cellulosome-integrating protein (cipa). man26a consisting of the cd alone (man26a") was hyperexpressed in escherichia coli bl21(de3) and purified. the truncated enzyme hydrolysed soluble and insoluble mannan, displaying a temperature optimum of 65 degrees c and a ph optimum of 6.5, but exhibited no activity against other plant cell wall polysaccharides. antiserum raised against man26a" cross-reacted with a polypeptide with a molecular mass of 70000 da that is part of the c. thermocellum cellulosome. a second variant of man26a containing the n-terminal segment of 130 residues and the cd (man26a") bound to ivory-nut mannan and weakly to soluble carob galactomannan and insoluble cellulose. man26a" consisting of the cd alone did not bind to these polysaccharides. these results indicate that the n-terminal 130 residues of mature man26a may constitute a weak mannan-binding domain. sequence comparisons revealed a lack of identity between this region of man26a and other polysaccharide-binding domains, but significant identity with a region conserved  in the three family 26 mannanases from the anaerobic fungus piromyces equi.

TI  == phage display of a cellulose binding domain from clostridium thermocellum and its application as a tool for antibody engineering.
AB  == phage display of antibody fragments has proved to be a powerful tool for the isolation and in vitro evolution of these biologically important molecules. however, the general usefulness of this technology is still limited by some technical difficulties. one of the most debilitating obstacles to the widespread  application of the technology is the accumulation of "insert loss" clones in the  libraries; phagemid clones from which the dna encoding part or all of the cloned  antibody fragment had been deleted. another difficulty arises when phage technology is applied for cloning hybridoma-derived antibody genes, where myeloma derived light chains, irrelevant to the hybridoma's antibody specificity may be fortuitously cloned. here, we report the construction of a novel phage-display system designed to address these problems. in our system a single-chain fv (scfv) is expressed as an in-frame fusion protein with a cellulose-binding domain (cbd)  derived from the clostridium thermocellum cellulosome. the cbd domain serves as an affinity tag allowing rapid phage capture and concentration from crude culture supernatants, and immunological detection of both displaying phage and soluble scfv produced thereof. we demonstrate the utility of our system in solving the technical difficulties described above, and in speeding up the process of scfv isolation from combinatorial antibody repertoires.

TI  == matrix-assisted refolding of single-chain fv- cellulose binding domain fusion proteins.
AB  == we describe a method for the isolation of recombinant single-chain antibodies in  a biologically active form. the single-chain antibodies are fused to a cellulose  binding domain as a single-chain protein that accumulates as insoluble inclusion  bodies upon expression in escherichia coli. the inclusion bodies are then solubilized and denatured by an appropriate chaotropic solvent, then reversibly immobilized onto a cellulose matrix via specific interaction of the matrix with the cellulose binding domain (cbd) moiety. the efficient immobilization that minimizes the contact between folding protein molecules, thus preventing their aggregation, is facilitated by the robustness of the clostridium thermocellum cbd we use. this cbd is unique in retaining its specific cellulose binding capability when solubilized in up to 6 m urea, while the proteins fused to it are fully denatured. refolding of the fusion proteins is induced by reducing with time the  concentration of the denaturing solvent while in contact with the cellulose matrix. the refolded single-chain antibodies in their native state are then recovered by releasing them from the cellulose matrix in high yield of 60% or better, which is threefold or higher than the yield obtained by using published refolding protocols to recover the same scfvs. the described method should have general applicability for the production of many protein-cbd fusions in which the fusion partner is insoluble upon expression.

TI  == characterization of an acetyl xylan esterase from the anaerobic fungus orpinomyces sp. strain pc-2.
AB  == a 1,067-bp cdna, designated axea, coding for an acetyl xylan esterase (axea) was  cloned from the anaerobic rumen fungus orpinomyces sp. strain pc-2. the gene had  an open reading frame of 939 bp encoding a polypeptide of 313 amino acid residues with a calculated mass of 34,845 da. an active esterase using the original start  codon of the cdna was synthesized in escherichia coli. two active forms of the esterase were purified from recombinant e. coli cultures. the size difference of  8 amino acids was a result of cleavages at two different sites within the signal  peptide. the enzyme released acetate from several acetylated substrates, including acetylated xylan. the activity toward acetylated xylan was tripled in the presence of recombinant xylanase a from the same fungus. using p-nitrophenyl  acetate as a substrate, the enzyme had a k(m) of 0.9 mm and a v(max) of 785 micromol min(-1) mg(-1). it had temperature and ph optima of 30 degrees c and 9.0, respectively. axea had 56% amino acid identity with bnaa, an acetyl xylan esterase of neocallimastix patriciarum, but the orpinomyces axea was devoid of a  noncatalytic repeated peptide domain (ncrpd) found at the carboxy terminus of the neocallimastix bnaa. the ncrpd found in many glycosyl hydrolases and esterases of anaerobic fungi has been postulated to function as a docking domain for cellulase-hemicellulase complexes, similar to the dockerin of the cellulosome of  clostridium thermocellum. the difference in domain structures indicated that the  two highly similar esterases of orpinomyces and neocallimastix may be differently located, the former being a free enzyme and the latter being a component of a cellulase-hemicellulase complex. sequence data indicate that axea and bnaa might  represent a new family of hydrolases.

TI  == cloning and sequence analysis of a new cellulase gene encoding celk, a major cellulosome component of clostridium thermocellum: evidence for gene duplication  and recombination.
AB  == the cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic complex of clostridium thermocellum, termed cellulosome, consists of up to 26 polypeptides, of which at least 17 have been sequenced. they include 12 cellulases, 3 xylanases, 1 lichenase, and cipa, a scaffolding polypeptide. we report here a new cellulase gene, celk, coding for celk, a 98-kda major component of the cellulosome. the gene has an open reading frame (orf) of 2,685 nucleotides coding for a polypeptide of 895 amino acid residues with a calculated mass of 100,552 da. a signal peptide of 27 amino acid  residues is cut off during secretion, resulting in a mature enzyme of 97,572 da.  the nucleotide sequence is highly similar to that of cbha (v. v. zverlov et al.,  j. bacteriol. 180:3091-3099, 1998), having an orf of 3,690 bp coding for the 1,230-amino-acid-residue cbha of the same bacterium. homologous regions of the two genes are 86.5 and 84.3% identical without deletion or insertion on the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. both have domain structures consisting of a signal peptide, a family iv cellulose binding domain (cbd), a family 9 glycosyl hydrolase domain, and a dockerin domain. a striking distinction between the two polypeptides is that there is a 330-amino-acid insertion in cbha  between the catalytic domain and the dockerin domain containing a fibronectin type 3-like domain and family iii cbd. this insertion, missing in celk, is responsible for the size difference between celk and cbha. upstream and downstream flanking sequences of the two genes show no homology. the data indicate that celk and cbha in the genome of c. thermocellum have evolved through gene duplication and recombination of domain coding sequences. celk without a dockerin domain was expressed in escherichia coli and purified. the enzyme had ph and temperature optima at 6.0 and 65 degrees c, respectively. it hydrolyzed p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-cellobioside with a km and a vmax of 1.67 microm and 15.1 u/mg, respectively. cellobiose was a strong inhibitor of celk activity, with a ki of 0.29 mm. the enzyme was thermostable, after 200 h of incubation at 60 degrees  c, 97% of the original activity remained. properties of the enzyme indicated that it is a cellobiohydrolase.

AB  == a 5.7-kbp region of the clostridium thermocellum f1 dna was sequenced and found to contain two contiguous and highly homologous xylanase genes, xyna and xynb. the xyna gene encoding the xylanase xyna consists of 2049 bp and encodes a protein of 683 amino acids with a molecular mass of 74,511 da, and the xynb gene  encoding the xylanase xynb consists of 1371 bp and encodes a protein of 457 amino acids with a molecular mass of 49,883 da. xyna is a modular enzyme composed of a  typical n-terminal signal peptide and four domains in the following order: a family-ii xylanase domain, a family-vi cellulose-binding domain, a dockerin domain, and a nodb domain. xynb exhibited extremely high overall sequence homology with xyna (identity 96.9%), while lacking the nodb domain present in the latter. these facts suggested that the xyna and xynb genes originated from a common ancestral gene through gene duplication. xyna was purified from a recombinant escherichia coli strain and characterized. the purified enzyme was highly active toward xylan; the specific activity on oat-spelt xylan was 689 units/mg protein. immunological and zymogram analyses suggested that xyna and xynb are components of the c. thermocellum f1 cellulosome.

TI  == thermostable aminopeptidase from pyrococcus horikoshii.
AB  == from the genome sequence data of the thermophilic archaeon pyrococcus horikoshii, an open reading frame was found which encodes a protein (332 amino acids) homologous with an endoglucanase from clostridium thermocellum (42% identity), deblocking aminopeptidase from pyrococcus furiosus (42% identity) and an aminopeptidase from aeromonas proteolytica (18% identity). this gene was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli, and the characteristics of the expressed protein were examined. although endoglucanase activity was not detected, this protein was found to have aminopeptidase activity to cleave the n-terminal amino  acid from a variety of substrates including both n-blocked and non-blocked peptides. the enzyme was stable at 90 degrees c, with the optimum temperature over 90 degrees c. the metal ion bound to this enzyme was calcium, but it was not essential for the aminopeptidase activity. instead, this enzyme required the cobalt ion for activity. this enzyme is expected to be useful for the removal of  n(alpha)-acylated residues in short peptide sequence analysis at high temperatures.

TI  == involvement of both dockerin subdomains in assembly of the clostridium thermocellum cellulosome.
AB  == clostridium thermocellum produces an extracellular cellulase complex termed the cellulosome. it consists of a scaffolding protein, cipa, containing nine cohesin  domains and a cellulose-binding domain, and at least 14 different enzymatic subunits, each containing a conserved duplicated sequence, or dockerin domain. the cohesin-dockerin interaction is responsible for the assembly of the catalytic subunits into the cellulosome structure. each duplicated sequence of the dockerin domain contains a region bearing homology to the ef-hand calcium-binding motif. two subdomains, each containing a putative calcium-binding motif, were constructed from the dockerin domain of cels, a major cellulosomal catalytic subunit. these subdomains, called ds1 and ds2, were cloned by pcr and expressed in escherichia coli. the binding of ds1 and ds2 to r3, the third cohesin domain of cipa, was analyzed by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. a stable complex was  formed only when r3 was combined with both ds1 and ds2, indicating that the two halves of the dockerin domain interact with each other and such interaction is required for effective binding of the dockerin domain to the cohesin domain.

AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the clostridium thermocellum f1 xync gene, which encodes the xylanase xync, consists of 1,857 bp and encodes a protein of 619 amino acids with a molecular weight of 69,517. xync contains a typical n-terminal signal peptide of 32 amino acid residues, followed by a 165-amino-acid sequence which is homologous to the thermostabilizing domain. downstream of this domain was a family 10 catalytic domain of glycosyl hydrolase. the c terminus separated  from the catalytic domain by a short linker sequence contains a dockerin domain responsible for cellulosome assembly. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of xync-ii, the enzyme purified from a recombinant escherichia coli strain, was in agreement with that deduced from the nucleotide sequence although xync-ii suffered from proteolytic truncation by a host protease(s) at the c-terminal region. immunological and n-terminal amino acid sequence analyses disclosed that  the full-length xync is one of the major components of the c. thermocellum cellulosome. xync-ii was highly active toward xylan and slightly active toward p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-xylopyranoside, p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-cellobioside, p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside, and carboxymethyl cellulose. the km and vmax values for xylan were 3.9 mg/ml and 611 micromol/min/mg of protein, respectively. this enzyme was optimally active at 80 degrees c and was stable up  to 70 degrees c at neutral phs and over the ph range of 4 to 11 at 25 degrees c.

AB  == clostridium thermocellum cell extracts exhibit specific endonuclease activity with very little non-specific exonuclease activity at 55 degrees c. the dam methylation system of escherichia coli offers complete protection from digestion  by c. thermocellum atcc 27405 cell extracts for all dna tested (totaling > 100 kb, insuring that most potential restriction sequences have been exposed). based  on both the dam recognition sequence and the similarity of cell extract and mboi  dna digests, the c. thermocellum restriction enzyme recognition sequence appears  to be 5' gatc 3'. cell extracts made from a second thermophile, c. thermosaccharolyticum atcc 31960 do not exhibit specific endonuclease activity under the conditions tested. genomic dna from c. thermocellum exhibits a dam+ phenotype while genomic dna from c. thermosaccharolyticum exhibits a dam- phenotype.

AB  == we constructed two vectors, pc27-glc and pc29-glc, that allow expression of the beta-1,3-glucanase gene (glc) in plant cells. the glc gene was previously cloned  from anaerobic thermophilous bacterium clostridium thermocellum. to increase the  efficiency of expression, the n-terminal fragment of the glc gene encoding bacterial transient peptide was deleted, and hybrid variants of lacz-glc were obtained. analysis of expression of the hybrid genes in escherichia coli showed that deletion of the fragment corresponding to 31 amino acids (a.a.) of beta-glucanase affected neither activity nor thermostability of the enzyme. the modified gene was subcloned into two vectors, pc27 and pc29, in which its expression was controlled by the tr2' promoter of the 2' gene of t-dna and the rbcs promoter from arabidopsis, respectively. each of the resulting plasmids, pc27-glc and pc29-glc, was transfected into protoplasts of nicotiana plumbaginifolia. both the plasmids were shown to allow a high level of activity of the thermostable beta-1,3-glucanase. we plan to use the vectors obtained for transformation of agrobacteria and construction of transgenic plants.

TI  == interactions of the cels binding ligand with various receptor domains of the clostridium thermocellum cellulosomal scaffolding protein, cipa.
AB  == the clostridium thermocellum cellulosomal scaffolding protein, cipa, acts as an anchor on the cellulose surface for the various catalytic subunits of the cellulosome, a large extracellular cellulase complex. cipa contains nine repeated domains that serve as receptors for the cellulosomal catalytic subunits, each of  which carries a conserved, duplicated ligand sequence (ds). four representative cipa receptor domains with sequence dissimilarity were cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the interaction of these cloned receptor domains with the duplicated ligand sequence of cels (expressed as a thioredoxin fusion protein, trx-dscels), was studied by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. trx-dscels formed a stable complex with each of the four receptor domains, indicating that cels, the most abundant cellulosomal catalytic subunit, binds nonselectively to all of the cipa receptors. conversely, the duplicated sequence  of cipa (in the form of trx-dscipa), which is homologous to that of cels, did not bind to any of the receptors under the experimental conditions.

TI  == product inhibition of the recombinant cels, an exoglucanase component of the clostridium thermocellum cellulosome.
AB  == cels is the most abundant subunit and an exoglucanase component of the clostridium thermocellum cellulosome, multicomponent cellulase complex. the product inhibition pattern of cels was examined using purified recombinant cels (rcels) produced in escherichia coli. the rcels activity on cellopentaose was strongly inhibited by cellobiose. the rcels activity was also inhibited by lactose. glucose was only marginally inhibitory. cellobiose appeared to inhibit the rcels activity through a competitive mechanism. the inhibition was relieved when beta-glucosidase was added, presumably because of the conversion of cellobiose into glucose. these hydrolysis product inhibition patterns are consistent with those of the crude enzyme (cellulosome), suggesting that cels is  a rate-limiting factor in the activity of the cellulosome.

TI  == the anchorage function of cipa (cell), a scaffolding protein of the clostridium thermocellum cellulosome.
AB  == enzymatic cellulose degradation is a heterogeneous reaction requiring binding of  soluble cellulase molecules to the solid substrate. based on our studies of the cellulase complex of clostridium thermocellum (the cellulosome), we have previously proposed that such binding can be brought about by a special "anchorage subunit." in this "anchor-enzyme" model, cipa (a major subunit of the  cellulosome) enhances the activity of cels (the most abundant catalytic subunit of the cellulosome) by anchoring it to the cellulose surface. we have subsequently reported that cels contains a conserved duplicated sequence at its c terminus and that cipa contains nine repeated sequences with a cellulose binding  domain (cbd) in between the second and third repeats. in this work, we reexamined the anchor-enzyme mechanism by using recombinant cels (rcels) and various cipa domains, cbd, r3 (the repeat next to cbd), and cbd/r3, expressed in escherichia coli. as analyzed by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis, rcels, through its conserved duplicated sequence, formed a stable complex with r3 or cbd/r3 but not  with cbd. although r3 or cbd alone did not affect the binding of rcels to cellulose, such binding was dependent on cbd/r3, indicating the anchorage role of cbd/r3. such anchorage apparently increased the rcels activity toward crystalline cellulose. these results substantiate the proposed anchor-enzyme model and the expected roles of individual cipa domains and the conserved duplicated sequence of cels.

TI  == direct isolation of functional genes encoding cellulases from the microbial consortia in a thermophilic, anaerobic digester maintained on lignocellulose.
AB  == gene libraries ("zoolibraries") were constructed in escherichia coli using dna isolated from the mixed liquor of thermophilic, anaerobic digesters, which were in continuous operation with lignocellulosic feedstocks for over 10 years. clones expressing cellulase and xylosidase were readily recovered from these libraries.  four clones that hydrolyzed carboxymethylcellulose and methylumbelliferyl-beta-d-cellobiopyranoside were characterized. all four cellulases exhibited temperature optima (60-65 degrees c) and ph optima (ph 6-7)  in accordance with conditions of the enrichment. the dna sequence of the insert in one clone (plasmid pfgh1) was determined. this plasmid encoded an endoglucanase (cela) and part of a putative beta-glucosidase (celb), both of which were distinctly different from all previously reported homologues. cela protein shared limited homology with members of the a3 subfamily of cellulases, being similar to endoglucanase c from clostridium thermocellum (40% identity). the n-terminal part of celb protein was most similar to beta-glucosidase from pseudomonas fluorescens subsp. cellulosa (28% homology). the use of zoolibraries  constructed from natural or laboratory enrichment cultures offers the potential to discover many new enzymes for biotechnological applications.

TI  == olpb, a new outer layer protein of clostridium thermocellum, and binding of its s-layer-like domains to components of the cell envelope.
AB  == several proteins of clostridium thermocellum possess a c-terminal triplicated sequence related to bacterial cell surface proteins. this sequence was named the  slh domain (for s-layer homology), and it was proposed that it might serve to anchor proteins to the cell surface (a. lupas, h. engelhardt, j. peters, u. santarius, s. volker, and w. baumeister, j. bacteriol. 176:1224-1233, 1994). this hypothesis was investigated by using the slh-containing protein orf1p from c. thermocellum as a model. subcellular fractionation, immunoblotting, and electron  microscopy of immunocytochemically labeled cells indicated that orf1p was located on the surface of c. thermocellum. to detect c. thermocellum components interacting with the slh domains of orf1p, a probe was constructed by grafting these domains on the c terminus of the male protein of escherichia coli. the slh  domains conferred on the chimeric protein (male-orf1p-c) the ability to bind noncovalently to the peptidoglycan of c. thermocellum. in addition, 125i-labeled  male-orf1p-c was shown to bind to slh-bearing proteins transferred onto nitrocellulose, and to a 26- to 28-kda component of the cell envelope. these results agree with the hypothesis that slh domains contribute to the binding of exocellular proteins to the cell surface of bacteria. the gene carrying orf1 and  its product, orf1p, are renamed olpb and olpb (for outer layer protein b), respectively.

TI  == evidence for a general role for non-catalytic thermostabilizing domains in xylanases from thermophilic bacteria.
AB  == a genomic library of clostridium thermocellum dna constructed in lambda zapii was screened for xylanase-expressing clones. cross-hybridization experiments revealed a new xylanase gene isolated from the gene library, which was designated xyn y. the encoded enzyme, xylanase y (xyly), displayed features characteristic of an endo-beta1,4-xylanase: the enzyme rapidly hydrolysed oat spelt, wheat and rye arabinoxylans and was active against methyl-umbelliferyl-beta-d-cellobioside, but did not hydrolyse any cellulosic substrates. the ph and temperature optima of the enzyme were 6.8 and 75 degrees c respectively, and the recombinant xyly, expressed by escherichia coli had a maximum mr of 116000. the nucleotide sequence of xyn y contained an open reading frame of 3228 bp encoding a protein of predicted mr 120 105. the encoded enzyme contained a typical n-terminal 26-residue signal peptide, followed by a 164 amino acid sequence, designated domain a, that was not essential for catalytic activity. downstream of domain a was a 351-residue xylanase family f catalytic domain, followed by a 180-residue sequence that exhibited 28% sequence identity with a thermostable domain of thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum xylanase a. the c-terminal portion of xyly  comprised the 23-residue duplicated docking sequence found in all other c. thermocellum plant cell wall hydrolases that are constituents of the bacterium's  multienzyme complex, termed the cellulosome, followed by a 286-residue domain which exhibited 32% sequence identity with the n-terminal region of c. thermocellum xylanase z. the enzyme did not contain linker sequences found in other c. thermocellum plant cell wall hydrolases. analysis of truncated forms of  xyly and hybrid proteins, comprising segments of xyly fused to the e. coli maltose binding domain, confirmed that xyly contained a central catalytic domain  and an adjacent thermostable domain. the c-terminal domain did not bind to cellulose or xylan. western blot analysis using antiserum raised against xyly showed that the xylanase was located in the cellulosome and did not appear to be  extensively glycosylated. the non-catalytic domains of xyly are discussed in relation to the general stability of thermophilic xylanases.

TI  == expression, purification and subunit-binding properties of cohesins 2 and 3 of the clostridium thermocellum cellulosome.
AB  == the enzymatic subunits of the cellulosome of clostridium thermocellum are integrated into the complex by a major non-catalytic polypeptide, called scaffoldin. its numerous functional domains include a single cellulose-binding domain (cbd) and nine subunit-binding domains, or cohesin domains. two of the cohesin domains, together with the adjacent cbd, have been cloned and expressed in escherichia coli, and the recombinant constructs were purified by affinity chromatography on a cellulosic matrix. both cohesin domains, which differ by about 30% in their primary structure, showed a similar binding profile to the cellulosomal subunits. calcium ions enhanced dramatically this binding. under the conditions of the assay, only one major catalytic subunit of the cellulosome failed to bind to either cohesin domain. the results indicate a lack of selectivity in the binding of cohesin domains to the catalytic subunits and also  suggest that additional mechanisms may be involved in cellulosome assembly.

TI  == cloning and expression of the clostridium thermocellum cels gene in escherichia coli.
AB  == clostridium thermocellum atcc 27405 produces an extremely complicated multi-component cellulase aggregate (cellulosome) highly active on crystalline cellulose. from the cellulosome, two subunits, cels (or ss; m(r) = 82,000) and cell (or sl, cipa; m(r) = 250,000), have been identified as essential for crystalline cellulose degradation [wu et al. (1988) biochemistry 27:1703]. we have determined the dna sequence of the cels gene from four cloned dna fragments  encompassing this gene [wang et al. (1993) j bacteriol 175:1293]. to express the  entire cels gene in escherichia coli, the cels structural gene was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) employing the pcr primers corresponding to sequences flanking the desired gene. this pcr product (2.1 x 10(3) bases; 2.1 kb) was cloned into an e. coli expression vector prset b. subsequent expression of the cloned gene resulted in a fusion protein (rcels; m(r) = 86,000) as inclusion  bodies. the rcels protein was recognized specifically by an anti-cels antiserum in a western blot analysis. the inclusion bodies were purified and solubilized in 5 m urea. the refolded rcels produced very little reducing sugar from carboxymethylcellulose. however, it showed a higher activity on the crystalline cellulose (avicel) and an even higher activity on phosphoric-acid-swollen avicel. these results indicate that the cels is an exoglucanase.

AB  == nucleotide sequencing of a 4.15 kb dna fragment from megaplasmid 2 of rhizobium meliloti 2011 revealed the location of the genes exoh, exok and exol. the putative proteins encoded by these genes have molecular weights of 41, 30, and 44 kda, respectively. the hydrophobicity profile of the exoh amino acid sequence resembles that of transmembrane proteins. the predicted exol gene product does not contain hydrophobic regions, indicating a cytoplasmic localization. the exok  gene product is characterized by a putative signal peptide and exhibits significant homology to endo-beta-1,3-1,4-glucanases of bacilli and clostridium thermocellum. r. meliloti exok mutants induced pink nodules and synthesized a reduced amount of exopolysaccharide (eps). colonies of this mutant showed a delay in the appearance of the calcofluor white fluorescence. in addition, the formation of the characteristic halo was strongly delayed. r. meliloti exol and exoh mutants induced pseudonodules. the exoh, but not the exol mutant, synthesized an eps that could be precipitated by cetyl pyridinium chloride (cpc)  and also by ethanol. plasmid integration mutagenesis revealed promoter regions preceding exoh, exok and exol.

TI  == secretion of a prokaryotic cellulase in bacterial and mammalian cells.
AB  == the catalytic domain of mature clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase e (ege') and derivatives of the enzyme fused to prokaryote and eukaryote signal peptides (sp), were produced in chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells and escherichia coli. all three forms of the endoglucanase were secreted into the periplasm of escherichia coli, but only derivatives of the enzyme containing an n-terminal sp  were exported from cho cells. extracellular ege', purified from e. coli and cho cultures, displayed similar properties suggesting that glycosylation of the enzyme in the eukaryote did not significantly alter the protein's properties. data presented in this report indicate that mature ege' contains secretion signals which are recognised only by the e. coli protein export apparatus, suggesting that there are differences in the recognition of certain secretion signals in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. as mature ege' does not contain secretion  signals recognised by the mammalian cell, membrane translocation of the bacterial cellulase in a higher eukaryote is directed by an n-terminal prokaryotic sp.

TI  == [specific proteolysis of clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase upon heterologous expression in escherichia coli cells].
AB  == the cel(1) gene of clostridium thermocellum encoding endoglucanase cloned earlier in escherichia coli was deleted at specific sites and fused with the e. coli gene lacz'. analysis of heterologous expression of the produced variants was performed. it was established that the post-translational modification of the clostridial endoglucanase in e. coli involves a membrane-linked n-terminal cleavage of 6 kda polypeptide during secretion through the cytoplasmic membrane and a c-terminal cleavage of 4 kda protein not related to the secretion. a comparative study of the authors' and literature data supports the suggestions that: (i) the cel(1) cloned in this laboratory is a deleted variant of the cloned cel(1) gene of c. thermocellum described previously by other authors, and (ii) the c-terminal proteolysis of the endoglucanase precursor takes place in a linker region connecting the catalytic and cellulose binding domains. an account of similar kind of proteolysis responsible for multiple forms of cellulolytic enzymes is given.

TI  == gene sequence and properties of celi, a family e endoglucanase from clostridium thermocellum.
AB  == the clostridium thermocellum celi gene, coding for endoglucanase i (celi), consists of an open reading frame (orf) of 2640 nucleotides and codes for a protein of m(r) 98531. the orf was confirmed as celi by comparing the n-terminal  sequence of purified recombinant celi with that deduced from the nucleotide sequence. celi hydrolysed lichenan and carboxymethylcellulose, but was principally active against barley beta-glucan. it exhibited significant sequence  identity with subfamily e2 endoglucanases, and by analogy with others in this group contains a catalytic domain of around 500 residues located in the n-terminal half of the protein. the c-terminal region of celi was highly homologous with the cellulose-binding domain of the non-catalytic cellulosome subunit, s1. a repeated segment, previously shown to be highly conserved in xylanase z and in other endoglucanases from c. thermocellum, was absent from celi. antiserum raised against purified recombinant celi cross-reacted with proteins contained in the cellulosomes of two strains of c. thermocellu, suggesting that celi is either a component of the cellulosome or is homologous to other cellulosome proteins. a second gene, located upstream of celi, consisted of an orf of 1671 nucleotides, coding for a protein of m(r) 61042. based on its homology with the escherichia coli tar gene product, the polypeptide encoded by the second gene is tentatively identified as a sensory transducer.

TI  == the gene encoding the cellulase (avicelase) cel1 from streptomyces reticuli and analysis of protein domains.
AB  == streptomyces reticuli produces an unusual cellulase (avicelase), with an apparent molecular weight of 82 kda, which is solely sufficient to degrade crystalline cellulose. during cultivation the processing of the avicelase to a truncated enzyme (42 kda) and an inactive protein (40 kda) correlated with the occurrence of an extracellular protease. after its purification this 36 kda protease cleaved the s. reticuli avicelase in vitro in the same manner. using antibodies raised against the avicelase and its truncated form (42 kda) and gene libraries of s. reticuli dna in the escherichia coli phage vectors lambda gt11 and charon 35, the avicelase gene (cel1) was identified. further subcloning and dna-sequencing revealed a g+c rich (72%) reading frame of 2238 bp encoding a protein of 746 amino acids. the transcriptional start site was mapped about 180 bp upstream from the gtg start codon. a signal sequence of 29 amino acids was identified by aligning the deduced amino acids with the characterized n-terminus of the 82 kda  avicelase. comparison of the n-terminal amino acids from the purified proteins with the amino acid sequence derived from the avicelase gene revealed that the truncated enzyme (42 kda) corresponds to the c-terminal region whereas the inactive proteolytically derived protein (40 kda) represents the n-terminal part  of the 82 kda avicelase. comparisons with amino acid sequences deduced from known cellulase genes indicated the presence of three putative protein domains: (i) an  n-terminal part showing significant similarity with a repeat region of endoglucanase c from cellulomonas fimi, recently shown to be a cellulose-binding  domain; (ii) an adjoining region sharing homology with the n-terminal domains with unknown function of endoglucanase a from pseudomonas fluorescens, endoglucanase d from clostridium thermocellum and a cellodextrinase from butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and (iii) a c-terminal catalytic domain belonging to cellulase family e.

(pmy1 to pmy3). to probe their usefulness, we used one of the plasmids (pmy1) to clone in e. coli a modified form of the cellulase gene (cela) from clostridium thermocellum in which the native signal peptide was replaced in vitro by that from the s-layer gene of t. thermophilus hb8. the hybrid product was expressed and exported by e. coli. when  the gene was transferred by transformation into t. thermophilus, the cellulase protein was also expressed and secreted at 70 degrees c.

TI  == characterization of the gene celd and its encoded product 1,4-beta-d-glucan glucohydrolase d from pseudomonas fluorescens subsp. cellulosa.
AB  == a genomic library of pseudomonas fluorescens subsp. cellulosa dna constructed in  puc18 and expressed in escherichia coli was screened for recombinants expressing  4-methylumbelliferyl beta-d-glucoside hydrolysing activity (mugase). a single mugase-positive clone was isolated. the mugase hydrolysed cellobiose, cellotriose, cellotetraose, cellopentaose and cellohexaose to glucose, by sequentially cleaving glucose residues from the non-reducing end of the cello-oligosaccharides. the km values for cellobiose and cellohexaose hydrolysis  were 1.2 mm and 28 microm respectively. the enzyme exhibited no activity against  soluble or insoluble cellulose, xylan and xylobiose. thus the mugase is classified as a 1,4-beta-d-glucan glucohydrolase (ec 3.2.1.74) and is designated  1,4-beta-d-glucan glucohydrolase d (celd). when expressed by e. coli, celd was located in the cell-envelope fraction; a significant proportion of the native enzyme was also associated with the cell envelope when synthesized by its endogenous host. the nucleotide sequence of the gene, celd, which encodes celd, revealed an open reading frame of 2607 bp, encoding a protein of m(r) 92,000. the deduced primary structure of celd was confirmed by the m(r) of celd (85,000) expressed by e. coli and p. fluorescens subsp. cellulosa, and by the experimentally determined n-terminus of the enzyme purified from e. coli, which showed identity with residues 52-67 of the celd translated sequence. the structure of the n-terminal region of full-length celd was similar to the signal  peptides of p. fluorescens subsp. cellulosa plant-cell-wall hydrolases. deletion  of the n-terminal 47 residues of celd solubilized mugase activity in e. coli. celd exhibited sequence similarity with beta-glucosidase b of clostridium thermocellum, particularly in the vicinity of the active-site aspartate residue,  but did not display structural similarity with the mature forms of cellulases and xylanases expressed by p. fluorescens subsp. cellulosa.

TI  == conversion of xylan to ethanol by ethanologenic strains of escherichia coli and klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  == a two-stage process was evaluated for the fermentation of polymeric feedstocks to ethanol by a single, genetically engineered microorganism. the truncated xylanase gene (xynz) from the thermophilic bacterium clostridium thermocellum was fused with the n terminus of lacz to eliminate secretory signals. this hybrid gene was  expressed at high levels in ethanologenic strains of escherichia coli ko11 and klebsiella oxytoca m5a1(ploi555). large amounts of xylanase (25 to 93 mu/mg of cell protein) accumulated as intracellular products during ethanol production. cells containing xylanase were harvested at the end of fermentation and added to  a xylan solution at 60 degrees c, thereby releasing xylanase for saccharification. after cooling, the hydrolysate was fermented to ethanol with the same organism (30 degrees c), thereby replenishing the supply of xylanase for a subsequent saccharification. recombinant e. coli metabolized only xylose, while recombinant k. oxytoca m5a1 metabolized xylose, xylobiose, and xylotriose but not xylotetrose. derivatives of this latter organism produced large amounts of intracellular xylosidase, and the organism is presumed to transport both xylobiose and xylotriose for intracellular hydrolysis. by using recombinant m5a1, approximately 34% of the maximal theoretical yield of ethanol was obtained from xylan by this two-stage process. the yield appeared to be limited by the digestibility of commercial xylan rather than by a lack of sufficient xylanase or by ethanol toxicity. in general form, this two-stage process, which uses a single, genetically engineered microorganism, should be applicable for the production of useful chemicals from a wide range of biomass polymers.

AB  == endoglucanase d from clostridium thermocellum was purified from inclusion bodies  formed upon its overproduction in escherichia coli, using 5 m urea as a solubilizing solution. we examined the effects of denaturing agents upon the stability of the pure soluble enzyme as a function of the temperature. at room temperature, guanidinium chloride induces an irreversible denaturation. by comparison, we observed no structural or functional effects at room temperature using high concentrations of urea as denaturing agent. the irreversible denaturation process observed with guanidinium chloride also occurs with urea but only at elevated temperature (greater than or equal to 60 degrees c); in 6 m urea, the activation energy of the denaturation reaction is decreased by a factor of only 1.8. we interpret the high resistance of this protein to urea as reflecting a reduced flexibility of its structure at normal temperatures which should be correlated to the thermophilic origin of this protein.

TI  == pseudomonas fluorescens subsp. cellulosa: an alternative model for bacterial cellulase.
AB  == pseudomonas fluorescens subsp. cellulosa, a gram-negative soil bacterium, can utilize crystalline cellulose or xylan as main sources of carbon and energy. synthesis of endoglucanases and xylanases is induced by avicel, filter paper, carboxymethylcellulose or xylan and is repressed by cellobiose, glucose or xylose. these enzymes are secreted into the culture supernatant fluid and do not  form aggregates or associate with the cell surface. cells of ps. fluorescens subsp. cellulosa do not adhere to cellulose. in cultures containing avicel or filter paper, a significant proportion of the secreted cellulase and xylanase activities becomes tightly bound to the insoluble cellulose. western blotting has revealed that endoglucanase b, xylanase a and a cellodextrinase encoded by genes  previously isolated from ps. fluorescens subsp. cellulosa and expressed in escherichia coli, are synthesized by the pseudomonad under a variety of conditions. these enzymes appear to be post-translationally modified, probably through glycosylation. overall, it appears that the cellulase/hemicellulase system of ps. fluorescens subsp. cellulosa differs from the model established for celluloytic anaerobes such as clostridium thermocellum.

AB  == by the use of a t7 expression system, endoglucanases-xylanases engb and engd from clostridium cellulovorans were hyperexpressed and purified from escherichia coli. the two enzymes demonstrated both endoglucanase and xylanase activities. the substrate specificities of both endoglucanases were similar except that engd had  four-times-greater p-nitrophenyl beta-1,4-cellobiosidase activity. the two proteins were very homologous (80%) up to the pro-thr-thr region which divided the protein into -nh2- and -cooh-terminals. the -cooh- region of engb has high homology to the endoglucanases and a xylanase from clostridium thermocellum and to an endoglucanase from clostridium cellulolyticum and did not show strong binding to cellulose (avicel). however, the -cooh- region of engd, which had homology to the cellulose-binding domains of cellulomonas fimi exo- and endoglucanases and to pseudomonas fluorescens endoglucanase, demonstrated binding ability to cellulose even when the domain was fused to the n-terminal domain of engb. by probing the avicel-purified cellulase complex (f8) with anti-engb and anti-engd antibodies, both engb and engd were shown to be present on the cellulase complex of c. cellulovorans. many proteins homologous to engb and engd  were also present on the complex.

TI  == structure of the beta-glucosidase gene bgla of clostridium thermocellum. sequence analysis reveals a superfamily of cellulases and beta-glycosidases including human lactase/phlorizin hydrolase.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the clostridium thermocellum gene bgla, coding for the thermostable beta-glucosidase a, has been determined. the coding region of 1344 bp was identified by comparison with the n-terminal amino acid squence of recombinant beta-glucosidase a purified from escherichia coli. the deduced amino  acid sequence corresponds to a protein of 51,482 da. the coding region is flanked by putative promoter and transcription terminator sequences. the protein is unrelated to beta-glucosidase b of c. thermocellum, but has a high level of similarity with other bacterial beta-glucosidases and phospho-beta-glucosidases.  similarity is also observed with the beta-galactosidase of the archaebacterium sulfolobus solfataricus. unexpectedly, it was found that human lactase-phlorizin  hydrolase contains three copies of a sequence closely related to c. thermocellum  beta-glucosidase a (up to 40% sequence identity). these diverse beta-glucosidases can therefore be grouped into an enzyme family (bga) of common structural design. sequence comparison by hydrophobic cluster analysis revealed that all bga enzymes share a well conserved region which is homologous to the catalytic domain of the  widely distributed cellulase family a. a distinctive feature of this domain is the sequence motif his-asn-glu-pro in which the catalytic residues his and glu are separated by 35-55 amino acid residues. the cellulase family a and the beta-glucosidase family bga might thus be considered as members of a protein super-family comprising beta-glucanases and beta-glycosidases from all three primary kingdoms of living organisms.

TI  == sequence analysis of the clostridium stercorarium celz gene encoding a thermoactive cellulase (avicelase i): identification of catalytic and cellulose-binding domains.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the celz gene coding for a thermostable endo-beta-1,4-glucanase (avicelase i) of clostridium stercorarium was determined. the structural gene consists of an open reading frame of 2958 bp which encodes a  preprotein of 986 amino acids with an mr of 109,000. the signal peptide cleavage  site was identified by comparison with the n-terminal amino acid sequence of avicelase i purified from c. stercorarium culture supernatants. the recombinant protein expressed in escherichia coli is proteolytically cleaved into catalytic and cellulose-binding fragments of about 50 kda each. sequence comparison revealed that the n-terminal half of avicelase i is closely related to avocado (persea americana) cellulase. homology is also observed with clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase d and pseudomonas fluorescens cellulase. the cellulose-binding region was located in the c-terminal half of avicelase i. it consists of a reiterated domain of 88 amino acids flanked by a repeated sequence  about 140 amino acids in length. the c-terminal flanking sequence is highly homologous to the non-catalytic domain of bacillus subtilis endoglucanase and caldocellum saccharolyticum endoglucanase b. it is proposed that the enhanced cellulolytic activity of avicelase i is due to the presence of multiple cellulose-binding sites.

AB  == the endoglucanase gene of clostridium thermocellum f7 was cloned in escherichia coli cells using pkm4 vector. both the physical mapping and analysis of the gene  products in the e. coli mini-cells system suggest cloning of a new cel gene different from those described earlier. the activity of endoglucanase in e. coli  cells is localized in the periplasm, which correlates with secretion of enzymes of this type in c. thermicellum. apart from 2 major components with mr 42.5 and 43 kda, corresponding to mature protein forms, we observed the formation of minor products of various electrophoretic motilities. cloning of the endoglucanase gene on bhr vector pbs954 controlled by its own regulatory signal yielded high level of the endoglucanase activity in the recombinant strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens and erwinia carotovora comparable with the level  of the gene expression in e. coli cells.

AB  == bacteroides ruminicola b(1)4, a noncellulolytic rumen bacterium, produces an endoglucanase (carboxymethylcellulase [cmcase]) that is excreted into the culture supernatant. cultures grown on glucose, fructose, maltose, mannose, and cellobiose had high specific activities of cmcase (greater than 3 mmol of reducing sugar per mg of protein per min), but its synthesis was repressed by sucrose. b. rumincola did not grow on either ball-milled or acid-swollen cellulose even though the cmcase could hydrolyze swollen cellulose. the cmcase gene was cloned into escherichia coli, and its nucleotide sequence contained a single open reading frame coding for a protein of 40,481 daltons. the enzyme was  overproduced in e. coli under the control of the tac promoter and purified to homogeneity. the n-terminal sequence, amino acid composition, and molecular weight of the purified enzyme were similar to the values predicted from the open  reading frame of the dna sequence. however, the cmcase present in b. ruminicola was found to have a monomer molecular weight of 88,000 by western immunoblotting. this discrepancy appeared to have resulted from our having cloned only part of the cmcase gene into e. coli. the amino acid sequence of the cmcase showed homology to sequences of beta-glucanases from ruminococcus albus and clostridium  thermocellum.

AB  == the cel-3 gene cloned from fibrobacter succinogenes into escherichia coli coded for the enzyme eg3, which exhibited both endoglucanase and cellobiosidase activities. the gene had an open reading frame of 1,974 base pairs, coding for a  protein of 73.4 kilodaltons (kda). however, the enzyme purified from the osmotic  shock fluid of e. coli was 43 kda. the amino terminus of the 43-kda protein matched amino acid residue 266 of the protein coded for by the open reading frame, indicating proteolysis in e. coli. in addition to the 43-kda protein, western immunoblotting revealed a 94-kda membranous form of the enzyme in e. coli and a single protein of 118 kda in f. succinogenes. thus, the purified protein appears to be a proteolytic degradation product of a native protein which was 94  kda in e. coli and 118 kda in f. succinogenes. the discrepancy between the molecular weight expected on the basis of the dna sequence and the in vivo form may be due to anomalous migration during electrophoresis, to glycosylation of the native enzyme, or to fatty acyl substitution at the n terminus. one of two putative signal peptide cleavage sites bore a strong resemblance to known lipoprotein leader sequences. the purified 43-kda peptide exhibited a high km (53 mg/ml) for carboxymethyl cellulose but a low km (3 to 4 mg/ml) for lichenan and barley beta-glucan. the enzyme hydrolyzed amorphous cellulose, and cellobiose and cellotriose were the major products of hydrolysis. cellotriose, but not cellobiose, was cleaved by the enzyme. eg3 exhibited significant amino acid sequence homology with endoglucanase celc from clostridium thermocellum, and as with both cela and celc of c. thermocellum, it had a putative active site which could be aligned with the active site of hen egg white lysozyme at the highly conserved amino acid residues asn-44 and asp-52.

AB  == an endoxylanase encoded by the xynz gene of clostridium thermocellum was purified from escherichia coli harbouring a fragment of the gene cloned in puc8. the purified enzyme showed two active bands of mr 41,000 and 39,000, the latter one presumably derived from the former through proteolysis. the enzyme was highly active on xylan and para-nitrophenyl-beta-d-xylobioside. the major end product of xylan hydrolysis was xylobiose. with an antiserum raised against the enzyme purified from e. coli, an immunoreactive polypeptide of mr 90,000, corresponding  to the entire xynz gene product, was detected in a culture supernatant from c. thermocellum grown on cellulose. by immunological detection, xylanase z was shown to be associated with a cellulose-binding, high-molecular-weight fraction whose properties coincided with those described previously for the cellulose-degrading  complex of c. thermocellum known as the cellulosome.

TI  == conserved reiterated domains in clostridium thermocellum endoglucanases are not essential for catalytic activity.
AB  == the complete nucleotide sequence of the clostridium thermocellum cele gene, coding for an endo-beta-1,4-glucanase (endoglucanase e; ege) with xylan-hydrolysing activity has been determined. the structural gene consists of an open reading frame (orf) of 2442 bp commencing with a gtg start codon and followed by a taa stop codon. the nucleotide sequence obtained has been confirmed by comparing the predicted amino acid sequence with that derived by n-terminal amino acid sequencing of the purified protein. the ege sequence contains a region homologous to the reiterated domain found at the c terminus of other endoglucanases from the same organism. bal 31 deletions of the structural gene have revealed the extent to which this conserved sequence is necessary for endoglucanase and xylanase activity. a region of dna, upstream from the structural gene has also been sequenced and a ribosome-binding site and putative  promoter sequences have been identified. a second orf which ends 349 bp 5' to the gtg start codon of the cele gene has also been identified. the encoded product contains a c terminus homologous to other c. thermocellum endoglucanases.

TI  == cloning and expression of two cellulase genes of clostridium cellulolyticum in escherichia coli.
AB  == two cellulase genes isolated from clostridium cellulolyticum strain atcc3519 were cloned in escherichia coli using plasmid pacyc184. plasmids pb52 and pb43 were isolated from the transformants producing carboxymethylcellulase (cmcase) and the two cloned cmcase-coding genes were found to be included in two ecori fragments of 5.7 kb and 2.6 kb, respectively. these two genes showed no homology. the cmcase-coding genes were found to be contained in a 1.8-kb kpni-hindiii fragment  and a 2.05-kb hindiii-pvuii fragment of the dna donor strain. expression of these genes in e. coli was found not to depend on their orientation in the cloning vector. hybridization experiments between these two fragments and clostridium thermocellum ncib10682 dna fragments carrying genes cela, celb, celc and celd were carried out and some homologies were detected.

TI  == nucleotide sequence of the celc gene encoding endoglucanase c of clostridium thermocellum.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the cellulase gene celc, encoding endoglucanase c of clostridium thermocellum, has been determined. the coding region of 1032 bp was identified by comparison with the n-terminal amino acid (aa) sequence of endoglucanase c purified from escherichia coli. the atg start codon is preceded by an aggagg sequence typical of ribosome-binding sites in gram-positive bacteria. the derived amino acid sequence corresponds to a protein of mr 40,439.  amino acid analysis and apparent mr of endoglucanase c are consistent with the amino acid sequence as derived from the dna sequencing data. a proposed n-terminal 21-aa residue leader (signal) sequence differs from other prokaryotic  signal peptides and is non-functional in e. coli. most of the protein bears no resemblance to the endoglucanases a, b, and d of the same organism. however, a short region of homology between endoglucanases a and c was identified, which is  similar to the established active sites of lysozymes and to related sequences of  fungal cellulases.

TI  == synthesis and secretion of a heat-stable carboxymethylcellulose from clostridium  thermocellum in bacillus subtilis and bacillus stearothermophilus.
AB  == the cellulase gene cela of clostridium thermocellum coding for the thermostable endoglucanase a was transferred from escherichia coli to bacillus subtilis 168 and b. stearothermophilus cu21 using plasmids derived from the bacillus vector pub110. when the structural part of the gene was joined to a pub110 promoter the  recombinant plasmids (pse102, pse105) were stably maintained and expressed carboxymethylcellulose (cmcase) activity. in b. stearothermophilus cu21 (pse105)  the clostridial cmcase was produced over a wide temperature range up to the maximal growth temperature (68 degrees c). in contrast to e. coli, all of the cmcase synthesized in bacilli was released into the culture medium. about 50% of  the extracellular protein secreted by b. subtilis 168 (pse102) carrying the cela  gene consisted of endoglucanase a. these findings demonstrate the feasibility of  producing cellulolytic enzymes from thermophilic anaerobes in bacilli.

TI  == molecular cloning of clostridium thermocellum dna and the expression of further novel endo-beta-1,4-glucanase genes in escherichia coli.
AB  == sau3a fragments of clostridium thermocellum (ncib 10682) dna were ligated into the bamhi site of pbr322 and expressed in escherichia coli hb101 and a lac- mutant thereof. twenty-eight clones with carboxymethylcellulase (cmcase) activity were selected from two libraries by means of the congo red plate assay. restriction enzyme analysis indicated that the cmcase+ clones contained a total of 13 unique dna inserts. hybridization of recombinant plasmids with chromosomal  dna confirmed the physical maps in all but one case and was further used to demonstrate the absence of homology between the hindiii restriction fragments of  similar size which occurred in many of the clones. without exception, cmcase+ e.  coli clones expressed endoglucanase activity, but differed with respect to the amount and nature of the enzyme activity produced; additionally, some clones had  exoglucanase activity which, in at least one case, was not attributable to the production of a second enzyme. for a few selected clones, the partially purified  cmcase was analysed by electrophoresis. a temperature profile characteristic of a thermostable enzyme was demonstrated for the endoglucanase of one of the most active clones. based on the evidence presented here, it is probable that the 13 unique dna fragments described do not contain any of the c. thermocellum endoglucanase genes previously cloned.

TI  == structure of a bacillus subtilis endo-beta-1,4-glucanase gene.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the portion of a bacillus subtilis (strain pap115) 3 kb pst i fragment which contains an endo-beta-1, 4-glucanase gene has been determined. this gene encodes a protein of 499 amino acid residues (mr = 55,234)  with a typical b. subtilis signal peptide. escherichia coli which has been transformed with this gene produces an extracellular endoglucanase with an amino-terminus corresponding to the thirtieth encoded amino acid residue. the gene is preceded by a cryptic reading frame with a rho-independent terminator structure, and itself has such a structure in the immediate 3'-flanking region. we have also identified, in the 5'-flanking region, nucleotide sequences which resemble promoter elements recognized by bacillus rna polymerase e sigma 43. comparison of the encoded amino acid sequence to other known beta-glucanases reveals a small region of similarity to the encoded protein of the clostridium thermocellum celb gene. these similar regions may contain substrate-binding and/or catalytic sites.

TI  == nucleotide sequence of the cellulase gene celd encoding endoglucanase d of clostridium thermocellum.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the celd gene, encoding the previously crystallized endoglucanase d of clostridium thermocellum, is reported. the enzyme shares a conserved, reiterated domain with the cooh-terminal end of endoglucanases a and b from the same organism. the overexpression in escherichia coli of celd subcloned  in puc8 appears to result from a translational fusion of the nh2-terminal end of  the endoglucanase with the nh2-terminal end of beta-galactosidase.

TI  == properties of a clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase produced in escherichia coli.
AB  == a cellulase gene of clostridium thermocellum was transferred to escherichia coli  by molecular cloning with bacteriophage lambda and plasmid vectors and shown to be indentical with the cela gene. the cela gene product was purified from extracts of plasmid-bearing e. coli cells by heat treatment and chromatography on deae-trisacryl. it was characterized as a thermophilic endo-beta-1,4-glucanase, the properties of which closely resemble those of endoglucanase a previously isolated from c. thermocellum supernatants. on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the enzyme purified from e. coli exhibited two protein bands with molecular weights of 49,000 and 52,000. it had a temperature optimum at 75 degrees c and was stable for several hours at 60 degrees c. endoglucanase activity was optimal between ph 5.5 and 6.5. the enzyme  was insensitive against end product inhibition by glucose and cellobiose and remarkably resistant to the denaturing effects of detergents and organic solvents. it was capable of degrading, in addition to cellulosic substrates, glucans with alternating beta-1,4 and beta-1,3 linkages such as barley beta-glucan and lichenan.

TI  == purification and properties of the endoglucanase c of clostridium thermocellum produced in escherichia coli.
AB  == the celc gene, which codes for a new endoglucanase of clostridium thermocellum, termed endoglucanase c, was found to be expressed when cloned in escherichia coli. the enzyme was purified to electrophoretic homogeneneity from e. coli and its biochemical properties were studied. it differs from the previously studied endoglucanases a and b. in particular, endoglucanase c displays features common to endo- and exoglucanases, since it had a high activity on carboxymethylcellulose and on p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-cellobioside where only the agluconic bond was split. in addition, the enzyme was able to release cellobiose  units from g3, g4 and g5 cellodextrins. endoglucanase c was characterized by western blot in a culture supernatant from c. thermocellum grown on cellulose, using an antiserum raised against the enzyme produced by e. coli.

TI  == mapping of mrna encoding endoglucanase a from clostridium thermocellum.
AB  == the size and location of the 5' end of cela mrna encoding endoglucanase a of clostridium thermocellum were investigated in c. thermocellum and in an escherichia coli clone that carries and expresses the cela gene. in e. coli, the  5' end of cela mrna was located 134 bp upstream from the initiation codon and 10  bp downstream from a sequence homologous to the consensus sequence of e. coli sigma 70 and bacillus subtilis sigma 43 (formerly sigma 55) vegetative promoters. in c. thermocellum, a minor transcript appeared to start from the same site, but  a major species started 57 bp upstream from the coding sequence. the 5' end of this mrna was preceded by a sequence reminiscent of b. subtilis sigma 28 vegetative promoters. in both organisms, the size of the transcript suggested that cela belongs to a monocistronic unit of transcription.
