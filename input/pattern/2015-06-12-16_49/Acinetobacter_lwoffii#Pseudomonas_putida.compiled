TI  - Evaluation of the impact of DNA extraction methods on BAC bacterial community composition measured by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  - AIMS: The impact of DNA extraction methods on biological activated carbon (BAC) DNA yield and bacterial community was evaluated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three different DNA extraction methods were compared: method a, method b and method c. Method c with ultrasonic pretreatment improved cell lysis efficiency (from 34% to 87%) and DNA yield [from 10.58 mug g(-)(1) (dry wt) of carbon to 21.42 mug g(-)(1) (dry wt) of carbon]. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles obtained by method c recovered the five seeded bacteria (Bacillus subtilis Strain WSO 6, Pseudomonas putida Strain WSO 7, Acinetobacter lwoffii WSO 10, Pseudomonas pertucinogena WSO 11 and Brevibacterium mcbrellneri WSO 13). CONCLUSIONS: The results showed method c with ultrasonic pretreatment was the most successful for the analysis of BAC bacterial community because it was effective in the detachment of bacteria and cell lysis, thereby resulting in good yields. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: These results must be taken into consideration when extracting DNA for analysing BAC bacterial community.
TI  - Effect of bacterial interference on biofilm development by Legionella pneumophila.
AB  - In the ecology of Legionella pneumophila a crucial role may be played by its relationship with the natural flora; thus we investigated the interactions between Legionella and other aquatic bacteria, particularly within biofilms. Among 80 aquatic bacteria screened for the production of bacteriocin-like substances (BLSs), 66.2% of them were active against L. pneumophila. The possible effect of some of these aquatic bacteria on the development and stability of L. pneumophila biofilms was studied. Pseudomonas fluorescens, the best BLS producer, showed the greatest negative effect on biofilm formation and strongly enhanced the detachment of Legionella. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Pseudomonas putida, Aeromonas hydrophila, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, although producing BLSs at different levels, were less active in the biofilm experiments. Acinetobacter lwoffii did not produce any antagonistic compound and was the only one able to strongly enhance L. pneumophila biofilm. Our results highlight that BLS production may contribute to determining the fate of L. pneumophila within ecological niches. The interactions observed in this study are important features of L. pneumophila ecology, which knowledge may lead to more effective measures to control the persistence of the germ in the environment.
TI  - [Detection methods and changes in metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative  rod isolates at Nagasaki University Hospital from 1991 to 2005].
AB  - Since plasmid-mediated metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing Pseudimonas aeruginosa was reported in Japan, MBL-producing Gram-negative rods (GNRs) have emerged worldwide. We developed a way to detect MBL-producing GNRs in routine examination using broth microdilution with the MBL inhibitor sodium mercaptoacetate (SMA) in frozen plates. Between 1996 and 2005, we evaluated this and other methods, including broth microdilution with another MBL inhibitor dipicolinic acid (DPA) in dry plates, conventional PCR, and a combined simple DNA preparation and enzymatic PCR product detection. The combined method is suitable for detecting IMP-type MBL-producing GNRs from numerous isolates. Broth microdilution with SMA at a concentration of 400 microg/mL had high performance and detected most PCR-positive MBL-producing GNRs in routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing. DPA in dry plates at 400 microg/mL yielded false positive results in 11.4% of isolates but worked satisfactorily at 175 microg/mL and 400 microg/mL of SMA in frozen plates. Until 1996, MBL had been detected from only 6 bacterial species, i.e., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Serratia marcescens, and Citrobacter freundii, MBL-producing GNRs were later found in other glucose nonfermenting GNRs such as Acinetobacter baumanii, Acinetobacter lwoffii, and Burkholderia cepacia complex and Enterobacteriaceae. Most MBL-producing bacteria were multidrug resistant and no antimicrobial agents exist that are active against such isolates in monotherapy, making their rapid detection very important in controlling infection control.
TI  - Evaluation of pyrrolidonyl arylamidase for the identification of nonfermenting Gram-negative rods.
AB  - To evaluate the activity of pyrrolidonyl arylamidase (PYR) for the differentiation and identification of nonfermenting gram negative rods (NFGNR), 293 isolates were tested. A 24 h culture of each test organism was prepared. From this a 108-109 cfu/mL suspension was added to 0.25 mL of sterile physiologic solution. A PYR disk was then added and the test was incubated for 30 minutes at 35-37 degrees C, at environmental atmosphere. Reading was done by adding 1 drop of cinnamaldehyde reagent. Strains of Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter haemolyticus, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bergeyella zoohelcum, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Bordetella hinzii, Brevundimonas diminuta, Brevundimonas vesicularis, Brucella ovis, Brucella spp., Brucella suis, Burkholderia cepacia complex, Moraxella catarrhalis, Moraxella lacunata, Moraxella nonliquefaciens, Moraxella osloensis, Oligella ureolytica, Pseudomonas alcaligenes, Pseudomonas mendocina, Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Pseudomonas Vb3, Psychrobacter phenylpyruvicus, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were PYR negative. On the other hand Achromobacter piechaudii, Achromobacter denitrificans, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Burkholderia gladioli, Chryseobacterium gleum-indologenes, Comamonas testosroni, Cupriavidus pauculus, Delftia acidovorans, Elizabethkingia meningoseptica, Myroides spp., Ochrobactrum anthropi, Pseudomonas oryzihabitans, Ralstonia pickettii, Rhizobium radiobacter, Shewanella spp., Sphingobacterium multivorum, Sphingobacterium spiritivorum, and Weeksella virosa were PYR positive. Finally, Acinetobacter lwoffii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Roseomonas spp., and Sphingomonas paucimobilis-parapaucimobilis were PYR variable. PYR testing should be considered as a useful tool to facilitate the identification of NFGNR.
TI  - Differential organization and transcription of the cat2 gene cluster in aniline-assimilating Acinetobacter lwoffii K24.
AB  - CatABC genes encode proteins that are responsible for the first three steps of one branch of the beta-ketoadipate pathway involved in the degradation of various aromatic compound by bacteria. Aniline-assimilating Acinetobacter lwoffii K24 is known to have the two-catABC gene clusters (cat1 and cat2) on the chromosome (Kim et al., J. Bacteriol., 179: 5226-5231, 1997). The order of the cat2 gene cluster is catB2A2C2, which has not been found in other bacteria. In this report, we analyzed the transcriptional pattern of the cat2 gene cluster and completely sequenced a 5.8 kbp fragment containing the compactly clustered catB2A2C2 genes and four ORFs. Similar to the ORF(R1) of the cat1 gene cluster, an ORF highly homologous with the catR gene was found 102 by upstream of the catB2 gene and was designated as ORF(R2). Three ORFs, one putative reductase component (ORF(X2)) and two putative LysR family regulatory proteins (ORF(Y2), ORF(Z2)) were located next to the catC2 gene in the opposite direction of the cat2 gene cluster. Two ORFs, ORF(X2) and ORF(Y2), were significantly homologous with tdnB and tdnR of the aniline oxygenase complex of Pseudomonas putida UCC22. RT-PCR analysis and Northern blotting revealed that the catB2 gene is independently transcribed and that the catA2C2 genes are cotranscribed. A primer extension assay revealed that transcription of the catA2C2 gene starts in the C-terminal region of the catB2 gene. These results suggest that the cat2 gene cluster may be under a different gene adaptation from other cat gene clusters.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. Changes in CZOP susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from the breakpoint MIC. Twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Serratia liquefaciens, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter Iwoffii, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Bacteroides fragilis group, and Prevotella/Porphyromonas. CZOP preserved its antibacterial activity against M. (B.) catarrhalis (MIC90: 4 micrograms/mL) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against H. influenzae (MIC90: 1 microgram/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. coli was preferable (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL) and comparable to those of cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), and imipenem (IPM). The MIC90 of CZOP against K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/mL, respectively. The MIC90 of CZOP against E. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. aerogenes was preferable (MIC90: 1 microgram/mL). The antibacterial activities of CZOP against S. marcescens and S. liquefaciens were relatively potent (MIC90: 0.5 and 0.25 microgram/mL) and comparable to those of CPR, CFPM, and carumonam. CZOP preserved comparable antibacterial activity to CPR against C. freundii and C. koseri (MIC90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/mL). The MIC90 of CZOP against P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, and M. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/mL, respectively. The antibacterial activity of CZOP against Providencia spp. was moderate (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against P. aeruginosa was the most potent (MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) among the test agents and comparable to those CFPM, IPM, and MEPM. CZOP had low activity against P. fluorescens and P. putida (MIC90: 128 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against A. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR and CFPM (MIC90: 32 micrograms/mL) and against A. lwoffii was moderate (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). Most of the test agents including CZOP had low antibacterial activity against B. cepacia, S. maltophilia, and B. fragilis group. The MIC90 of CZOP against Prevotella/Porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/mL. Bacterial cross-resistance ratio between CZOP and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. In non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between CZOP and CFPM, CAZ, CPR, or IPM was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. In conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. cloacae possible decreased, but against other Gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.
TI  - A comparison of the bacteria found on the hands of 'homemakers' and neonatal intensive care unit nurses.
AB  - This prevalence study was conducted to compare the counts, types and antimicrobial resistance profiles of bacterial flora on the hands of individuals in the community to that of nurses at a nearby university teaching hospital, with an intense hand hygiene regimen. Hand cultures were obtained from 204 individuals during a home visit and 119 nurses in two neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). The mean total log counts of organisms were 5.73 and 5.24 for the homemakers [defined as the person (usually the mother) who is the primary person responsible for arranging childcare, cooking, cleaning etc] and nurse hands, respectively (P<0.0001). Significantly more homemakers had Acinetobacter lwoffii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens/putida, and Staphylococcus aureus on their hands compared with the nurses (all P<0.05). However, significantly more nurses had Enterococcus faecalis, S. epidermidis, and S. warneri on their hands (P<0.05). Of note, the hands of nurses harboured significantly more S. epidermidis strains resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and oxacillin and S. warneri resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, and oxacillin (P<0.05). Surprisingly, significantly more trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant S. epidermidis and ciprofloxacin-resistant S. warneri was recovered from the hands of homemakers (P<0.05). This study demonstrates differences in prevalence, bacterial composition and antimicrobial resistance of hand flora of hospital personnel compared with homemakers. Moreover, the hands of homemakers may serve as community reservoirs for antimicrobial resistant strains of clinical importance.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. Changes in CZOP susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with the breakpoint MIC. Twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), Escherichia coli (n = 276), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 93), Serratia marcescens (n = 172), Serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), Citrobacter freundii (n = 177), Citrobacter koseri (n = 70), Proteus mirabilis (n = 113), Proteus vulgaris (n = 89), Morganella morganii (n = 116), Providencia spp. (n = 41), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), Pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), Pseudomonas putida (n = 63), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), Acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), Burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and Prevotella/Porphyromonas (n = 173). An antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, and S. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. MIC90 of CZOP against M.(B.) catarrhalis, C. koseri, and P. aeruginosa was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. MIC90 of CZOP against E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, and P. mirabilis increased year by year. The increase in MIC90 of CZOP against E. aerogenes and P. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. In contract, the susceptibility of E. cloacae to CZOP was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to CZOP. MIC90 of CZOP against C. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. Additionally, MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against P. fluorescens, P. putida, B. cepacia, S. maltophilia, B. fragilis group, and Prevotella/Porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. Changes in MIC90 of CZOP against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.
TI  - Complete nucleotide sequence and overexpression of cat1 gene cluster, and roles of the putative transcriptional activator CatR1 in Acinetobacter lwoffii K24 capable of aniline degradation.
AB  - The aniline-assimilating bacterium Acinetobacter lwoffii K24 has two cat gene clusters (cat1 and cat2). In this study, we completely sequenced 10-kb DNA fragment of cat1 genes of A. lwoffii K24, which had been cloned in plasmid pCD1-1. Sequence analysis revealed that the order of genes in the cat1 operon-containing gene cluster was ORF porin, catR1, catB1C1A1D, ORF1, and ORF2. Two ORFs located immediately downstream catD were most similar with two ORFs in cat gene cluster of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus ADP1 but the gene structure of catR1B1C1A1 was closest to that found in Frateurua sp. ANA-18 or Pseudomonas putida PRS2000. CatA1 gene product was significantly overexpressed and detected in SDS-PAGE when four cat1 genes (catB1C1A1D) were placed under the control of a lac promoter in pUC118 while overexpressions of other cat genes were accomplished under the control of a lac promoter in pET vector system. All gene products were verified by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Gel retardation assay revealed that the putative regulatory gene activator CatR1 for the catB1C1A1 operon could bind the promoter region of catB2 as well as catB1, suggesting that transcription of catB1 or catB2 might be controlled by the putative gene activator CatR1. However, the promoter regions of catA1 and catA2 were found to have no affinity with catR1.
TI  - [Prevalence of microbiota in the digestive tract of wild females of Lutzomyia longipalpis Lutz & Neiva, 1912) (Diptera: Psychodidae)].
AB  - We dissected the digestive tract of 245 females in pools of 35 flies forming 7 groups. These flies were Lutzomyia longipalpis originating from Lapinha Cave, Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais. Out of the 8 species of bacteria isolated there was a predominancy of Gram negative bacterias (GNB) in the group of non-fermenters of sugar belonging to the following species: Acinetobacter lwoffii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas putida and Flavimonas orizihabitans. The group of GNB fermenters were: Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella ozaenae. In the Gram positive group we isolated the genera Bacillus thuringiensis and Staphylococcus spp.
TI  - In vitro activity of imipenem towards gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - The authors studied the in vitro antimicrobial activity of imipenem towards 355 gram-negative bacterial strains, taking into particular consideration unusual or dangerous species. The study was carried out on a comparative basis with piperacillin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and gentamicin. Ninety percent of the fermentative gram-negative strains were inhibited at concentrations less than or equal to 2 mg/l. Imipenem inhibited 100% of strains of Alcaligenes faecalis, Alcaligenes denitrificans, Flavobacterium odoratum, Acinetobacter lwoffii, Acinetobacter anitratum, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas stutzeri and 90% of strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida. The excellent bactericidal activity of imipenem was indicated by its minimum bactericidal concentrations equal to or slightly greater than its minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC). As far as the other parameters were concerned (influence of the dimensions of inoculum and culture medium on MICs), imipenem confirmed its excellent in vitro microbiologic characteristics.
TI  - [The identification of nonfermentative gram-negative bacteria. Experiences with 676 apyocyaninogenic strains (author's transl)].
AB  - During a period of 16 months 1757 strains of nonfermentative gram-negative rods have been isolated from clinical material. Of the, 1205 (69%) were P. aeruginosa, 124 (10%) of which failed to produce pyocyanin. The apyocyaninogenic strains as well as the remaining 552 isolates were differentiated by steps according to a diagnostic scheme developed by us. For identification of species two or three steps were needed. By this procedure, 530 of the 552 strains could be assigned to nineteen species within the genera Pseudomonas, Achromobacter, Alcaligenes, Flavobacterium, Agrobacterium and Acinetobacter. 17 strains could not be identified below the genus level, one strain belonged to CDC-group VE-2 and four strains were not identifiable. 72% of the 552 strains belonged to only four species: Pseudomonas putida, P. maltophilia, Acinetobacter lwoffii and A. anitratus.
TI  - Semiquantitative catalase test as an aid in identification of oxidative and nonsaccharolytic gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A simple and rapid semiquantitative slide catalase test useful for the identification of oxidative and nonsaccharolytic gram-negative bacteria, i.e., "nonfermenters," is described. Using the interpretative criterion of time of appearance of oxygen bubbles in 3% hydrogen peroxide, three categories of nonfermenters were established. The rapid catalase producers included Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Achromobacter species; Acinetobacter anitratus and Acinetobacter lwoffii; Bordetella bronchiseptica; CDC group IVE; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, P. putida, P. diminuta, and P. acidovorans; and Moraxella urethralis and M-6. The delayed catalase producers included Bordetella parapertussis, CDC group VA-1, P. alcaligenes, P. cepacia, P. mendocina, P. pickettii (VA-2), P. pseudoalcaligenes, P. putrefaciens, P. stutzeri, P. testosteroni, and P. vesicularis. The third group consisted of an additional 17 taxa of nonfermenters which were classified as moderate catalase producers.
TI  - Identification of Gram-negative non-fermenters and oxidase-positive fermenters by the Oxi/Ferm tube.
AB  - Since the recent introduction of the Roche Oxi/Ferm Tube to the UK two identification schemes have been developed by the manufacturer for use with the kit. We evaluated the success of these two schemes in identifying 222 predominantly culture collection strains belonging to 45 taxa of non-fermenters and nine taxa of oxidase-positive fermenters. The strains were chosen to represent all the taxa included in the two identification schemes developed by the manufacturer and we have therefore been able to assess the overall success of identification by the two schemes. Since, however, our choice of strains does not reflect their incidence in clinical material, our identification rates are not necessarily those that might be obtained in a routine clinical laboratory. The most advanced identification scheme so far developed for the Oxi/Ferm Tube (CCIS System 1977-1432) allowed 62% of the 222 strains to be correctly identified although a disturbing feature was that more of the strains that were not correctly identified were incorrectly identified (24%) rather than not identified (14%); these figures represent an improvement over the earlier identification scheme (CCIS System 1976-621-74346) for which the corresponding figures were 56%, 32%, and 12%. CCIS System 1977-1432 seems likely to give a better performance in a routine clinical laboratory than in this study since for those taxa which, we would judge from the material sent to us for identification, are most commonly seen in a routine laboratory (Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, A. lwoffii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, P. maltophilia, P. pseudoalcaligenes, and P. putida) 89% were correctly identified, none remained unidentified, and 11% were incorrectly identified. Thirty strains, each of a different taxon, were tested in triplicate to assess the reproducibility of reactions in the Oxi/Ferm Tube.
