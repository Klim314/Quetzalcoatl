TI  == the surface layer of tannerella forsythia contributes to serum resistance and oral bacterial coaggregation.
AB  == tannerella forsythia is an anaerobic, gram-negative bacterium involved in the so-called "red complex," which is associated with severe and chronic periodontitis. the surface layer (s-layer) of t. forsythia is composed of cell surface glycoproteins, such as tfsa and tfsb, and is known to play a role in adhesion/invasion and suppression of proinflammatory cytokine expression. here we investigated the association of this s-layer with serum resistance and coaggregation with other oral bacteria. the growth of the s-layer-deficient mutant in a bacterial medium containing more than 20% non-heat-inactivated calf serum (cs) or more than 40% non-heat-inactivated human serum was significantly suppressed relative to that of the wild type (wt). next, we used confocal microscopy to perform quantitative analysis on the effect of serum. the survival  ratio of the mutant exposed to 100% non-heat-inactivated cs (76% survival) was significantly lower than that of the wt (97% survival). furthermore, significant  c3b deposition was observed in the mutant but not in the wt. in a coaggregation assay, the mutant showed reduced coaggregation with streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, and porphyromonas gingivalis but strong coaggregation with fusobacterium nucleatum. these results indicated that the s-layer of t. forsythia plays multiple roles in virulence and may be associated with periodontitis.

TI  == comparison of oral microbiota in tumor and non-tumor tissues of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma.
AB  == background: bacterial infections have been linked to malignancies due to their ability to induce chronic inflammation. we investigated the association of oral bacteria in oral squamous cell carcinoma (oscc/tumor) tissues and compared with adjacent non-tumor mucosa sampled 5 cm distant from the same patient (n = 10). by using culture-independent 16s rrna approaches, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and cloning and sequencing, we assessed the total bacterial diversity in these clinical samples. results: dgge fingerprints showed  variations in the band intensity profiles within non-tumor and tumor tissues of the same patient and among the two groups. the clonal analysis indicated that from a total of 1200 sequences characterized, 80 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected representing six phyla, firmicutes, bacteroidetes, proteobacteria,  fusobacteria, actinobacteria and uncultivated tm7 in non-tumor and tumor libraries. in combined library, 12 classes, 16 order, 26 families and 40 genera were observed. bacterial species, streptococcus sp. oral taxon 058, peptostreptococcus stomatis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus gordonii, gemella haemolysans, gemella morbillorum, johnsonella ignava and streptococcus parasanguinis i were highly associated with tumor site where as granulicatella adiacens was prevalent at non-tumor site. streptococcus intermedius was present in 70% of both non-tumor and tumor sites. conclusions: the underlying changes in  the bacterial diversity in the oral mucosal tissues from non-tumor and tumor sites of oscc subjects indicated a shift in bacterial colonization. these most prevalent or unique bacterial species/phylotypes present in tumor tissues may be  associated with oscc and needs to be further investigated with a larger sample size.

TI  == b7-h1 and b7-dc receptors of oral squamous carcinoma cells are upregulated by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == the up-regulation of the b7-h1 receptors in host cells might influence the chronicity of inflammatory disorders that frequently precede the development of human cancers. b7-h1 expression has been detected in the majority of human cancers, leading to anergy and apoptosis of activated t cells, and enabling tumor cells to overcome host response. porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis), a putative periodontal pathogen, is an etiologic agent of periodontitis and expresses a variety of virulence factors. in this study, the expression of b7-h1  and b7-dc receptors on squamous cell carcinoma cells scc-25 and bhy and primary human gingival keratinocytes (phgk) was analyzed after infection with two virulent p. gingivalis strains in vitro. after 48h, the cells were stained with antibodies for human b7-h1 and b7-dc and further analyzed by flow cytometry. rna  was extracted and gene expression of b7-h1 or b7-dc was quantified by real time pcr. after infection with p. gingivalis, both b7-h1 and b7-dc receptors were up-regulated. the mean fluorescence intensity (mfi) increased from 4.5 to 9.9 (b7-h1) and from 6.9 to 15.0 (b7-dc) (p<0.05, respectively) in scc-25 cells. phgk showed an increase from 4.8 to 12.4 (b7-h1) and from 5.5 to 15.6 (b7-dc) (p<0.05, respectively). streptococcus salivarius k12, a commensal bacterium, caused no up-regulation. after 24h, the expression of b7h1 and b7-dc mrna in infected cells, normalized to gapdh and in relation to non-infected cells, was 6.4 fold (b7-h1) and 8.6 fold (b7-dc) higher. in phgk b7-h1/dc mrna expression increased 8.2 fold (b7-h1) and 5.9 fold (b7dc) (p<0.05) respectively. the results of the study demonstrate that in contrast to s. salivarius k12 virulent p. gingivalis strains are able to induce the expression of the b7-h1 and b7-dc receptors in squamous carcinoma cells and human gingival keratinocytes, which might facilitate immune evasion by oral cancers.

TI  == effects of probiotic lactobacillus salivarius wb21 on halitosis and oral health:  an open-label pilot trial.
AB  == objective: the objective of this study was to evaluate whether oral administration of lactobacilli alters the degree of halitosis and clinical conditions associated with halitosis. study design: twenty patients with genuine  halitosis were given 2.0 x 10(9)lactobacillus salivarius wb21 and xylitol in tablet form daily. oral malodor and clinical parameters were evaluated at the same time of day for each patient after 2 and 4 weeks. results: all 20 patients were positive for l. salivarius dna in their saliva at 2 weeks, although 12 patients were negative for this organism at baseline. oral malodor parameters significantly decreased at 2 weeks in the subjects with physiologic halitosis. the scores of an organoleptic test and bleeding on probing significantly decreased at 4 weeks in the subjects with oral pathologic halitosis. conclusions: oral administration of probiotic lactobacilli primarily improved physiologic halitosis and also showed beneficial effects on bleeding on probing from the periodontal pocket.

TI  == molecular identification of bacteria on the tongue dorsum of subjects with and without halitosis.
AB  == aim: compare the microbial profiles on the tongue dorsum in patients with halitosis and control subjects in a uk population using culture-independent techniques. materials and methods: halitosis patients were screened according to  our recently developed recruitment protocol. scrapings from the tongue dorsum were obtained for 12 control subjects and 20 halitosis patients. bacteria were identified by pcr amplification, cloning and sequencing of 16s rrna genes. results: the predominant species found in the control samples were lysobacter-type species, streptococcus salivarius, veillonella dispar, unidentified oral bacterium, actinomyces odontolyticus, atopobium parvulum and veillonella atypica. in the halitosis samples, lysobacter-type species, s. salivarius, prevotella melaninogenica, unidentified oral bacterium, prevotella veroralis and prevotella pallens were the most commonly found species. for the control samples, 13-16 (4.7-5.8%) of 276 clones represented uncultured species, whereas in the halitosis samples, this proportion increased to 6.5-9.6% (36-53 of 553 clones). in the control samples, 22 (8.0%) of 276 clones represented potentially novel phylotypes, and in the halitosis samples, this figure was 39 (7.1%) of 553 clones. conclusions: the microflora associated with the tongue dorsum is complex in both the control and halitosis groups, but several key species predominate in both groups.

TI  == reduction of periodontal pathogens adhesion by antagonistic strains.
AB  == introduction: periodontitis results from a shift in the subgingival microflora into a more pathogenic direction with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans considered as periodontopathogens. in many cases, treatment procures only a temporary shift towards a less pathogenic microflora. an alternative treatment could be the deliberate colonization of pockets with antagonistic microorganisms to control the adhesion of periodontopathogens. the aim of this study was to identify bacterial strains that reduce adhesion of periodontopathogens to surfaces. methods: streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus crista, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces naeslundii, and haemophilus parainfluenzae were  evaluated as potential antagonists against p. gingivalis atcc 33277, p. intermedia atcc 49046, and a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718 as periodontopathogens. adhesion of periodontopathogens to the bottom plate of a parallel plate flow chamber was studied in the absence (control) and the presence of pre-adhering antagonistic strains up to a surface coverage of 5%. results: the largest reduction caused by antagonistic strains was observed for p. gingivalis.  all antagonistic strains except s. crista atcc 49999 inhibited the adhesion of p. gingivalis by at least 1.6 cells per adhering antagonist, with the largest significant reduction observed for a. naeslundii atcc 51655 (3.8 cells per adhering antagonist). adhering antagonists had a minimal effect on the adhesion of a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718. intermediate but significant reductions were perceived for p. intermedia, most notably caused by s. mitis bms. conclusion: the adhesion of p. gingivalis was inhibited best by antagonistic strains, while s. mitis bms appeared to be the most successful antagonist.

TI  == identification of commensal bacterial strains that modulate yersinia enterocolitica and dextran sodium sulfate-induced inflammatory responses: implications for the development of probiotics.
AB  == an increasing body of evidence suggests that probiotic bacteria are effective in  the treatment of enteric infections, although the molecular basis of this activity remains elusive. to identify putative probiotics, we tested commensal bacteria in terms of their toxicity, invasiveness, inhibition of yersinia-induced inflammation in vitro and in vivo, and modulation of dextran sodium sulfate (dss)-induced colitis in mice. the commensal bacteria escherichia coli, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides distasonis, and streptococcus salivarius were screened for adhesion to, invasion of, and toxicity for host epithelial cells (ec), and the strains were tested for their ability to  inhibit y. enterocolitica-induced nf-kappab activation. additionally, b. adolescentis was administered to mice orally infected with y. enterocolitica and  to mice with mucosae impaired by dss treatment. none of the commensal bacteria tested was toxic for or invaded the ec. b. adolescentis, b. distasonis, b. vulgatus, and s. salivarius inhibited the y. enterocolitica-induced nf-kappab activation and interleukin-8 production in ec. in line with these findings, b. adolescentis-fed mice had significantly lower results for mean pathogen burden in the visceral organs, intestinal tumor necrosis factor alpha mrna expression, and  loss of body weight upon oral infection with y. enterocolitica. in addition, the  administration of b. adolescentis decelerated inflammation upon dss treatment in  mice. we suggest that our approach might help to identify new probiotics to be used for the treatment of inflammatory and infectious gastrointestinal disorders.

TI  == streptococcus salivarius promotes mucin putrefaction and malodor production by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == although the contribution of the oral microbiota to oral malodor is well-documented, the potential role of gram-positive micro-organisms is unclear.  in the current study, we tested the hypothesis that gram-positive micro-organisms contribute to malodor production by deglycosylating oral glycoproteins, rendering them susceptible to subsequent proteolysis. to this end, we examined the effect of streptococcus salivarius on porphyromonas gingivalis-mediated putrefaction of  a model glycoprotein (pig gastric mucin). malodor was scored by two odor judges,  and volatile sulfides were determined with the use of a sulfide monitor. mucin degradation was followed by electrophoresis on sds-page. results showed that the  addition of s. salivarius or beta-galactosidase promoted mucin degradation and concomitant malodor production. addition of glycosidic inhibitors (p-aptg and glucose) inhibited this process. these results suggest that gram-positive micro-organisms such as s. salivarius contribute to oral malodor production by deglycosylating salivary glycoproteins, thus exposing their protein core to further degradation by gram-negative micro-organisms.

TI  == microbial analysis of the autogenous bone collected by bone filter during oral surgery: a clinical study.
AB  == purpose: the purposes of the study presented are to identify the microbial content of the collected bone debris and to determine the antibacterial efficiency of chlorhexidine mouth rinse in reducing the microbial content of the  collected bone debris. patients and methods: twenty-five patients who had asymptomatic fully impacted mandibular third molars bilaterally underwent surgical removal for prophylactic and orthodontic considerations. immediately before surgery all patients rinsed with 10 ml of their assigned solution (chlorhexidine or sterile saline) for 2 minutes. before surgical removal of the teeth, bone debris was collected with a stringent aspiration protocol from the ramus by bone filter. the microbial content of the bone debris was assessed and the bacterial levels between the 2 groups were compared statistically. results: all samples from both groups (chlorhexidine or sterile saline) yielded viable microorganisms. there was no significant difference between the mean/median colony-forming units (cfu)/g values of both group samples, for aerobes (streptococcus salivarius) and anaerobes (bacteroides, peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, and veillonella species). with regard to total microorganisms, the mean cfu/g derived from the chlorhexidine group samples were  1.5 x 10(8) cfu/g per bone sample compared with 1.5 x 10(9) cfu/g for the sterile saline control group (p < .05). conclusion: although chlorhexidine rinsing immediately before surgery reduced the levels of total microorganisms when compared with stringent aspiration protocol alone, it has not been found effective on aerobic streptococcus salivarius and, importantly, on anaerobes. the reduced bacterial levels may still carry high infectious risk and may lead to failure in autogenous grafting procedures in oral surgery.

TI  == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

TI  == coaggregation of streptococcus salivarius with periodontopathogens: evidence for  involvement of fimbriae in the interaction with prevotella intermedia.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius is divided into two serological subgroups that carry either fibrils or fimbriae. although fimbriae have been observed on up to 50% of  s. salivarius strains in the human oral cavity, no function has yet been assigned to them. to determine whether s. salivarius fimbriae have a role in adhesion, we  examined the ability of s. salivarius to coaggregate with selected microorganisms involved in periodontal diseases. our results show that s. salivarius coaggregated with fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia. however, only fimbriated s. salivarius cells were able to  coaggregate with p. intermedia, suggesting a specific role for these structures in the interaction. heat treatment, sensitivity to sugars, amino acids, and edta, as well as protease treatment were also used to further characterize coaggregation between s. salivarius and periodontopathogens.

TI  == subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.
AB  == little information is available on the effect of miswak use on gingival microbiota. we assessed levels of 28 oral bacteria in subgingival plaque of adult sudanese miswak (n = 38) and toothbrush users (n = 36) age range 20-53 years (mean 34.6 years) to study associations between these bacteria, oral hygiene method, and periodontal status at the sampled sites. a pooled subgingival plaque  sample from 6 probing sites of 1 selected tooth in each jaw was obtained from each subject. whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization were used in assessing 74 pooled samples. using 10(5) bacterial cells threshold,  between 2.6% and 47.4% of miswak users and between 2.8% and 36.1% of toothbrush users harbored the investigated species. the percentages of subjects with the investigated species at 10(6) bacterial cells varied between 2.6% and 39.5% in miswak and between 2.8% and 36.1% in toothbrush users. miswak users harbored significantly higher streptococcus intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, veillonella parvula, actinomyces israelii, and capnocytophaga gingivalis, and significantly lower selenomonas sputigena, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, and streptococcus oralis than did toothbrush users. probing pocket depth > or = 6 mm showed significantly (p <  0.05) higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and v. parvula than those 4-5 mm. our results indicate that the type of oral hygiene had a significant effect on levels of 11 out of 28 bacterial species, and that the type of effect was also dependent on type of bacteria and probing pocket depth.

TI  == salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in sudanese adults.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult sudanese subjects. material and methods: the study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. the periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using whole genomic dna probes. results: a high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or =  105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. between 12% and 16%  of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, c. rectus and e. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, respectively. there were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. presence of > or = 105 l. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). there were significantly higher levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, c. rectus, p. micros, v. parvula, s. mutans, s. anginosus, a. israelii, c. sputigena, and c. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, e. corrodens, l. acidophilus, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. oralis, and s. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. conclusions: : the findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. this is the first report that the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.

TI  == the effect of oral bacteria on candida albicans germ-tube formation.
AB  == a total of eight bacterial isolates belonging to six species, and a select group  of 12 oral candida albicans isolates, were used to study the effect of bacteria on germ-tube formation. briefly, each bacterial suspension (10(5-6) cells/ml) was mixed with a c. albicans suspension (10(7) cells/ml) and incubated at 37 degrees  c for 90 min with bovine serum, and the percentage germ-tube-positive candida cells was quantified using a haemocytometer, under light microscopy. in general,  out of eight bacteria, streptococcus sanguis sk21a, streptococcus salivarius sk56, escherichia coli atcc 25922, and s. salivarius obu3 suppressed germ-tube formation to varying degrees, with different c albicans isolates. porphyromonas gingivalis pg 50, lactobacillus casei atcc 7469 and prevotella intermedia obu4 elicited significant enhancement of germ-tube formation, whereas s. sanguis obu 2 had no effect. e. coli atcc 25922 was the only organism to show statistically significant suppression of germ-tube formation (p=0.0312). a significant increase in the germ tube production of c. albicans isolated from hiv-infected compared with hiv-free individuals was also noted. the current results tend to suggest that commensal and transient oral bacterial populations may selectively influence the differential expression of germ-tube-forming ability of c. albicans isolates.

TI  == the effects of histatin-derived basic antimicrobial peptides on oral biofilms.
AB  == susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is strongly reduced by the formation of complex biofilms. we investigated whether synthetic histatin analogs with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro were also active against these complex mixtures of bacteria, as present in saliva and plaque. in a simplified model system for dental plaque, hydroxyapatite discs were placed in a  continuous culture system comprised of streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia. ex situ treatment of the biofilms formed on these discs with 100 microg/ml of peptide dhvar4 significantly reduced facultative anaerobic, total anaerobic, and obligate anaerobic gram-negative counts with 0.8, 0.5, and 0.5 log units, respectively. ex vivo treatment of salivary bacteria gave reductions of 0.4, 0.7, and 1.5 log units, respectively. for ex vivo treatment of plaque bacteria, reductions of 0.4, 0.4, and 1.4 log units, respectively, were found. in both saliva and plaque samples, obligate anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were significantly more susceptible to dhvar4 than facultatively anaerobic or anaerobic bacteria as a whole (p=0.013 and p=0.018, for salivary bacteria, and p=0.021 and p=0.020 for plaque bacteria, respectively). although the oral bacteria are protected by biofilm formation, the synthetic histatin analog caused a significant reduction of viable counts in a model for oral biofilm as well as in isolated oral biofilms.

AB  == the effect of streptococcus sanguis, s. salivarius, escherichia coli and porphyromonas gingivalis on the adhesion of candida albicans and c. krusei to human buccal epithelial cells (bec) was investigated with a modified membrane filter system. the filters (12 microns diameter pores) acted as a support for the bec which were pre-exposed to known concentrations of bacterial suspensions (for  45 min-1 h), and then re-incubated with standardised concentrations of yeast suspensions for various periods. the bec with adherent yeasts were then transferred on to a glass slide, gram-stained and counted by light microscopy. three of the four bacterial species significantly suppressed adhesion of c. albicans to bec; s. sanguis had no effect. both s. sanguis and s. salivarius suppressed adhesion of c. krusei to bec pre-exposed to three different bacterial  concentrations, although variable results were obtained with p. gingivalis and e. coli. significant differences in the relative adhesion of c. albicans and c. krusei to bec were also recorded. these results indicate that the adhesion of yeasts to bec is modulated both by the composition and the quantity of the pre-existing bacterial flora on the bec.

AB  == the effect of four different species of oral bacteria (streptococci (x 2); escherichia; porphyromonas) on the adhesion of candida albicans and candida krusei to denture acrylic surfaces was studied using a previously described in vitro adhesion assay. clear acrylic strips immersed in known concentrations of bacterial suspensions and incubated for 45 min to 1 h, at 37 degrees c, were transferred to yeast suspensions of known concentrations and incubated for a similar period, and the adherent yeasts were quantified using an image analysis system. pre-exposure to different bacterial concentrations resulted in suppression of candidal adhesion to varying degrees. of three selected concentrations, exposure to the highest bacterial concentration (10(6) organisms/ml) resulted in a consistent reduction in candidal adhesion, except for e. coli-c. albicans and s. salivarius-c. albicans combinations. candidal adhesion was significantly reduced on pre-exposure to s. sanguis and p. gingivalis, but not e. coli. there were also significant differences in relative adhesion between c. albicans and c. krusei. taken together, these results indicate that the adhesion of yeasts to acrylic strips is modulated both by the quantity and the quality of pre-existing bacterial flora on acrylic surfaces.

TI  == delmopinol interactions with cell walls of gram-negative and gram-positive oral bacteria.
AB  == the main purpose of the present study was to investigate the influence of delmopinol hydrochloride on the cell surface morphology of gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial cells by using transmission electron microscopy. a second purpose was to evaluate the extraction of cell wall material caused by delmopinol and the binding of radiolabelled delmopinol to the various strains. fresh isolates and type strains of gram-negative rods associated with periodontal disease, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and strains of the gram-positive streptococci streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus salivarius, were exposed to 3.2 mm (0.1%) or 6.4 mm (0.2%) delmopinol hydrochloride from 1 to 90 min. for electron microscopy the cells were fixed and negatively contrast-stained. treatment with 6.4 mm delmopinol for 1 min resulted in marked ultrastructural changes of cell wall components and the outer cell membrane of the 3 gram-negative species compared with control cells, whereas the gram-positive streptococci treated with delmopinol showed little or no morphologic alteration as compared with untreated cells. the result from the electron microscopy was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins released from bacterial cells treated as for electron microscopy. more material was extracted from the gram-negative rods than from the gram-positive cocci. significantly more delmopinol bound to the gram-negative rods than to the streptococci. it appears that the amphiphilic properties of delmopinol make gram-negative rods more vulnerable to delmopinol than gram-positive streptococci.

AB  == an insertion sequence-like element, is1139, was cloned and sequenced from streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975 chromosome. this insertion sequence-like element is 1168 bp long and is delimited by inverted repeats of 29 bp and by a duplicated sequence of 6 bp. this is possesses an open reading frame that codes for a putative transposase of 339 amino acids which has, respectively, 94, 35, 33, and 30% amino-acid identity with the transposases of is1161 from s. salivarius atcc 25975, is4351 from bacteroides fragilis, is30 from escherichia coli, and is1086 from alcaligenes eutrophus. sequence analysis revealed that these transposases may have evolved from a common ancestral gene. southern hybridization of restriction endonuclease-digested genomic dna from 21 strains of oral streptococci, using a probe specific to the transposase-encoding gene (tnpa), revealed that is1139 is found in two strains of s. salivarius, atcc 25975 and atcc 13419, in eight and two copies, respectively.

TI  == effect of calcium ions on cell surface electrostatics of bacteroides gingivalis and other oral bacteria.
AB  == surface electrostatics of bacteroides gingivalis and other oral bacteria were examined. a polarization circuit was employed using platinum electrodes exposed in each bacterial suspension and the number of bacteria adsorbed to the anode and cathode were then estimated. in all bacteria (b. gingivalis, streptococcus sobrinus, s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis and actinomyces viscosus), the number of cells adsorbed to the anode were much greater than the number of cells  adsorbed to the cathode. treating these bacteria with calcium ions tended to decrease the ratio of the number of cells adsorbed to the anode to the number of  cells adsorbed to the cathode in all bacteria examined. moreover, in the case of  b. gingivalis, the number of cells adsorbed to the anode and cathode was in an inverse relationship to the number counted before calcium ion treatment. these findings indicate that the cell surfaces of oral bacteria are generally negatively charged but only the cell surface electrostatics of b. gingivalis was  dramatically affected by calcium ion treatment. thus, divalent metal bridges such as calcium bridges contribute to the adherence of the periodontopathic bacterium, b. gingivalis rather than to that of other oral bacteria including cariogenic bacteria.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to assess the antimicrobial effect of tif4 as compared with equimolar solutions of naf, apf, and snf2 and to evaluate the effect, if any, on bacterial growth on topically treated tooth surfaces. in an in vitro study, paper discs impregnated with 20 microliters of equimolar solutions of snf2, naf, apf, and tif4 were placed on blood agar plates seeded with streptococcus mutans and bacteroides gingivalis. sterile saline was used as control. similar growth inhibition zones were found for all fluorides. in the second part of the study six volunteers carried intraoral appliances containing enamel and root surface specimens treated with 1% tif4 and untreated specimens for 18 h. scanning electron microscopic examination of the experimental tooth surfaces showed great variation in bacterial growth between subjects, but no systematic difference between fluoride-treated and untreated specimens. bacteria  from test and control specimens were grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions on blood agar and on mitis salivarius agar. colony-forming unit counts showed great interindividual variations, but no differences could be observed between treated and untreated enamel or root surfaces. thus, the hypothesis that the presence of a ti-rich coating may influence bacterial colonization on tif4-treated tooth surfaces could not be substantiated.

TI  == coagglutination reactions between candida albicans and oral bacteria.
AB  == an agglutination assay for detecting intermicrobial adherence between the cells of candida albicans and various oral bacteria is described. strains of streptococcus sanguis, s. salivarius, s. mutans, s. mitis, fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces viscosus all coagglutinated with c. albicans. no interaction could be demonstrated between the cells of bacteroides melaninogenicus and those of c. albicans. preliminary investigations of these interactions suggest that binding of f. nucleatum and a. viscosus to c. albicans  is mediated by bacterial proteins, possibly lectins. other mechanisms must account for the binding of oral streptococci to c. albicans. the possible implications of these findings in relation to oral mucosal colonisation and oral  candidal clearance are discussed.

TI  == the development of bacterial flora of premature neonates.
AB  == the sequential acquisition of bacterial flora by premature neonates was studied during a 10 month period. mean gestational age of the babies was 29.01 weeks and  the mean birth weight was 1.728 kg. escherichia coli and group b streptococci (gbs) colonized the umbilicus of 7 and 6 babies respectively, out of 23 studied,  on the first day of life. e. coli and staphylococci were the predominant flora on the 6th day and they colonized 12 and 13 respectively. the oral flora was predominantly gram-positive cocci, mainly streptococcus salivarius which was isolated from 17 out of 22 babies on the 6th day, viridans streptococci were isolated from 14 babies, staphylococcus albus from 16 babies and group d streptococci from 11 babies. candida spp. also colonized the oral cavities of 17  out of 22 babies on the 6th day. at the end of the first week of life, the faecal flora was predominantly anaerobic represented by bifidobacterium spp., bacteroides spp. and clostridium spp. the commonest facultative faecal flora were e. coli, which was isolated from all the babies, and strept. faecalis isolated from 20 babies. early gut colonization by gbs, bacteroides spp. and clostridium spp. was noticed in more babies delivered vaginally than by caesarean section where colonization by these bacteria was relatively delayed. the use of prophylactic penicillin plus gentamicin in the special neonatal unit probably prevented systemic spread of any of the potential opportunistic pathogens during  the study.

TI  == microbial ecology of plaque in rats with naturally occurring gingivitis.
AB  == the microbial ecology of adherent plaque was investigated in relation to the pathological findings of gingivitis in plaque-susceptible rats. plaque developed  in the gingiva of the lower incisor in plaque-susceptible rats, but not in plaque-resistant rats, after they were fed a commercial powder diet. with increase in plaque volume, the total counts of bacteria increased 10(9) to 10(11)/g. in the first 3 months, bacteroides species increased and became the predominant population. streptococcus species also increased at the same time. after 9 months, fusobacterium species and oral treponema species were recognized  in increasing numbers. the anaerobic bacteria increased in proportion with the progression of plaque development. bacteroides intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus salivarius, and other species were isolated. acute gingivitis was observed within 3 months, and subacute-chronic gingivitis was observed between 2 and 12 months. these findings suggest that proportional changes in the gingival plaque flora may uniquely contribute to the development of gingival inflammation in this experimental model.

TI  == coaggregation of human oral cytophaga species and actinomyces israelii.
AB  == a total of 19 strains of oral cytophaga sp. obtained from subgingival plaque deposits were tested for their ability to coaggregate with strains of actinomyces israelii, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii, streptococcus sanguis, s. mutans, s. salivarius, and s. mitis. coaggregation was observed only with a. israelii. based on their coaggregation patterns with eight a. israelii strains, the cytophaga strains were distributed among three distinct groups: those that coaggregated with a. israelii pk16 but not with a. israelii w1011 (atcc 29322), those that coaggregated with a. israelii atcc 29322 but not with a. israelii pk16, and those that coaggregated with none of the eight a. israelii strains. in each of the coaggregations, prior heat treatment (85 degrees c, 30 min) of the cytophaga cells prevented coaggregation, whereas identical treatment of the a. israelii cells had no effect. the ability of a. israelii pk16 to form adherent plaque on a tooth surface previously coated with cytophaga plaque was tested with one of the  coaggregating cytophaga strains. white patches of a. israelii plaque were found covering both the amber-colored cytophaga plaque on the cementum surface as well  as the enamel surface to which cytophaga strains do not adhere. electron micrographs of thin-sectioned mixed-plaque material revealed both cell types in close proximity. in addition, electron micrographs of negatively stained coaggregated cells showed interbacterial adherence between surface fimbrae on a.  israelii and outer membrane blebs on the gram-negative cytophaga sp. the kinetics of binding of a. israelii to spheroidal hydroxyapatite and to root powder were indicative of a high-affinity binding system with comparatively large numbers of  available binding sites on both substrata. these results indicate the highly specific nature of cytophaga sp.--a. israelii recognition. the contribution of such recognition toward the mechanisms that are responsible for the indigenous nature of these oral bacteria is discussed.

TI  == the development of the bacterial flora in normal neonates.
AB  == the development of the bacterial flora of neonates during the first week of life  was studied in 23 babies. specimens of meconium or faeces were collected and swabs taken from the umbilicus and mouth on days, 1, 2, 3 and 6. the bacteria present were isolated on a variety of plain and selective media. the predominant  faecal organisms by the end of the first week were anaerobes. bifidobacteria were isolated from all the neonates and bacteroides and clostridia were isolated from  78.3%. bifidobacteria and bacteroides were present in large numbers; other species were isolated in smaller numbers. enterococci were isolated from all neonates, enterobacteria from 82.6%, anaerobic cocci from 52.2%, and streptococci and staphylococci from 34.8% each. staphylococcus aureus was the predominant species isolated from the umbilicus; it was isolated from 21.7% of neonates on the first day rising to 87.0% by the sixth day and represented 49% of isolates from this site. s. albus, streptococci, enterococci and escherichia coli were each isolated from a few neonates. viridans streptococci (31.4% of isolates) and  streptococcus salivarius (25.1%) were the commonest species recovered from the mouth. they were present from 8 h after birth; s. albus and neisseria spp. were isolated later on the first day, and anaerobic species of veillonella and bifidobacterium appeared on the second day.
