TI  == clostridium saccharogumia sp. nov. and lactonifactor longoviformis gen. nov., sp. nov., two novel human faecal bacteria involved in the conversion of the dietary phytoestrogen secoisolariciresinol diglucoside.
AB  == two anaerobic bacteria involved in the conversion of the plant lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside were isolated from faeces of a healthy male adult. the first isolate, strain sdg-mt85-3db, was a mesophilic strictly anaerobic gram-positive helically coiled rod. based on 16s r rna gene sequence analysis, its nearest relatives were clostridium cocleatum (96.7% similarity) and clostridium ramosum (96.6%). in contrast to these species, the isolate was devoid of alpha-galactosidase and -glucosidase and did not grow on maltose, melibiose, raffinose, rhamnose and trehalose. the hypothesis that strain sdg-mt85-3db represents a new bacterial species of the clostridium cluster xviii was confirmed by dna-dna hybridisation experiments. the g+c content of dna of strain sdg-mt85-3db (30.7+/-0.8 mol%) was comparable with that of clostridium butyricum, the type species of the genus clostridium. the name clostridium saccharogumia is  proposed for strain sdg-mt85-3db (=dsm 17460t=ccug 51486t). the second isolate, strain ed-mt61/pyg-s6, was a mesophilic strictly anaerobic gram-positive regular  rod. based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis, its nearest relatives were clostridium amygdalinum (93.3%), clostridium saccharolyticum (93.1%) and ruminococcus productus (93.0%). the isolate differed from these species in its ability to dehydrogenate enterodiol. it also possessed alpha-arabinosidase and -galactosidase and had a higher g+c content of dna (48.0 mol%). according to these findings, it is proposed to create a novel genus, lactonifactor, and a novel species, lactonifactor longoviformis, to accommodate strain ed-mt61/pyg-s6. the type strain is dsm 17459t (=ccug 51487t).
