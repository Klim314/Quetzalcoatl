TI  - Senior Thai fecal microbiota comparison between vegetarians and non-vegetarians using PCR-DGGE and real-time PCR.
AB  - The fecal microbiotas were investigated in 13 healthy Thai subjects using polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Among the 186 DNA bands detected on the polyacrylamide gel, 37 bands were identified as representing 11 species: Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Clostridium colicanis, Eubacterium eligenes, E. rectale, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Megamonas funiformis, Prevotella copri, and Roseburia intestinalis, belonging mainly to the groups of Bacteroides, Prevotella, Clostridium, and F. prausnitzii. A dendrogram of the PCR-DGGE divided the subjects; vegetarians and non-vegetarians. The fecal microbiotas were also analyzed using a quantitative real-time PCR focused on Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Enterobacteriaceae, Clostrium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale, C. leptum, Lactobacillus, and Prevotella. The nonvegetarian and vegetarian subjects were found to have significant differences in the high abundance of the Bacteroides and Prevotella genera, respectively. No significant differences were found in the counts of Bifidabacterium, Enterobacteriaceae, C. coccoides-E. rectale group, C. leptum group, and Lactobacillus. Therefore, these findings on the microbiota of healthy Thais consuming different diets could provide helpful data for predicting the health of South East Asians with similar diets.
TI  - Effect of Lactobacillus salivarius Ls-33 on fecal microbiota in obese adolescents.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: This study is a part of the clinical trials with probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus salivarius Ls-33 conducted in obese adolescents. Previously reported clinical studies showed no effect of Ls-33 consumption on the metabolic syndrome in the subject group. The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of L. salivarius Ls-33 on fecal microbiota in obese adolescents. METHODS: The study was a double-blinded intervention with 50 subjects randomized to intake of L. salivarius Ls-33 or placebo for 12 weeks. The fecal microbiota was assessed by real-time quantitative PCR before and after intervention. Concentrations of fecal short chain fatty acids were determined using gas chromatography. RESULTS: Ratios of Bacteroides-Prevotella-Porphyromonas group to Firmicutes belonging bacteria, including Clostridium cluster XIV, Blautia coccoides_Eubacteria rectale group and Roseburia intestinalis, were significantly increased (p </= 0.05) after administration of Ls-33. The cell numbers of fecal bacteria, including the groups above as well as Clostridium cluster I, Clostridium cluster IV, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus, the Lactobacillus group and Bifidobacterium were not significantly altered by intervention. Similarly, short chain fatty acids remained unaffected. CONCLUSION: L. salivarius Ls-33 might modify the fecal microbiota in obese adolescents in a way not related to metabolic syndrome. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: NCT 01020617.
TI  - The antimicrobial action of chitosan, low molar mass chitosan, and chitooligosaccharides on human colonic bacteria.
AB  - Antibacterial effect of chitooligosaccharides (COS) and low molar mass chitosans  (LMWC) is considered as one of the most important characteristics of chitosan (CS) hydrolysates. Here, we show the in vitro effect of different COS, LMWC, and CS on representative anaerobic bacteria isolated from human colon as a possibility of targeting modification of colonic microflora composition by supplementation of dietary CS products by humans. Specific growth rate of seven selected nonpathogenic anaerobic bacterial strains (Clostridium paraputrificum, Clostridium beijerinckii, Roseburia intestinalis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteriodes thetaiotaomicron, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Blautia coccoides) was determined in the presence of 0.25 and 0.5% COS (2, 3, and 6 kDa), 0.025 and 0.05% of LMWC (10 and 16 kDa), and 0.025 and 0.1% of CS in vitro. The growth rate decreased in all strains in the presence of COS and LMWC in higher concentrations in comparison to control incubations. A relatively higher resistance to CS hydrolyzates was detected in R. intestinalis and F. prausnitzii, and more susceptible were bacteria belonging to Bacteoides sp. and Clostridium sp. The antimicrobial activity, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC), and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) were determined. The antimicrobial activity increased with the degree of polymerization (DP). MIC ranged from 0.25 to 4.5% in dependence on bacterial strain and DP of CS/LMWC. MBC also decreased with DP. The most effective antimicrobial action was detected in LMWC with 16 kDa and CS. Weak antimicrobial activity was found in COS with small molecules (2 and 3 kDa).
TI  - Dietary fibre degradation and fermentation by two xylanolytic bacteria Bacteroides xylanisolvens XB1A and Roseburia intestinalis XB6B4 from the human intestine.
AB  - AIMS: To characterize fibre degradation, colonization and fermentation, and xylanase activity of two xylanolytic bacteria Bacteroides xylanisolvens XB1A(T) and Roseburia intestinalis XB6B4 from the human colon. METHODS AND RESULTS: The bacteria grew well on all the substrates chosen to represent dietary fibres: wheat and corn bran, pea, cabbage and leek fibres, and also on purified xylans. Roseburia intestinalis colonized the substrates more efficiently than Bact. xylanisolvens. For the two bacteria, 80-99% of the total xylanase activity was associated with the cells whatever the substrate and time of growth. Optimal specific activities of cells were obtained on oat spelt xylan; they were higher than those previously measured for xylanolytic bacteria from the human gut. Roseburia intestinalis produced high molecular mass xylanases (100-70 kDa), while Bact. xylanisolvens produced lower molecular mass enzymes, including a cell-associated xylanase of 37 kDa. CONCLUSIONS: The two bacteria display very high xylanolytic activity on the different substrates. Differences were observed on substrate attachment and enzyme systems, suggesting that the two species occupy different niches within the gut microbiota. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study characterizes xylan degradation by two major species of the human intestine.
TI  - Detection of possible AI-2-mediated quorum sensing system in commensal intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The Vibrio harveyi strain BB170-autoinducer bioassay was used to detect possible  quorum sensing autoinducer-2 molecule (AI-2) in culture fluids of commensal intestinal bacteria. Culture fluids of Bacteroides vulgatus, Clostridium proteoclasticum, Escherichia coli, Eubacterium rectale, Lachnospira multipara, Pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, Roseburia intestinalis, Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens contained AI-2-like molecules. The PCR bands from some of the tested strains could be also amplified using primers designed for the luxS gene. These findings suggest that AI-2 is present in the gastrointestinal tract; however, it has not yet been proved whether it is used for bacterial cell-to-cell communication.
TI  - Characterization of the xylan-degrading microbial community from human faeces.
AB  - In humans, plant cell wall polysaccharides represent an important source of dietary fibres that are digested by gut microorganisms. Despite the extensive degradation of xylan in the colon, the population structure and the taxonomy of the predominant bacteria involved in degradation of this polysaccharide have not been extensively explored. The objective of our study was to characterize the xylanolytic microbial community from human faeces, using xylan from different botanic origins. The xylanolytic population was enumerated at high level in all faecal samples studied. The predominant xylanolytic organisms further isolated (20 strains) were assigned to Roseburia and Bacteroides species. Some Bacteroides isolates corresponded to the two newly described species Bacteroides intestinalis and Bacteroides dorei. Other isolates were closely related to Bacteroides sp. nov., a cellulolytic bacterium recently isolated from human faeces. The remaining Bacteroides strains could be considered to belong to a new species of this genus. Roseburia isolates could be assigned to the species Roseburia intestinalis. The xylanase activity of the Bacteroides and Roseburia isolates was found to be higher than that of other gut xylanolytic species previously identified. Our results provide new insights to the diversity and activity of the human gut xylanolytic community. Four new xylan-degrading Bacteroides species were identified and the xylanolytic capacity of R. intestinalis was further shown.
TI  - Studies on the effect of system retention time on bacterial populations colonizing a three-stage continuous culture model of the human large gut using FISH techniques.
AB  - Fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to quantitate bacteria growing in a three-stage continuous culture system inoculated with human faeces, operated at two system retention times (60 and 20 h). Twenty-three different 16S rRNA gene oligonucleotide probes of varying specificities were used to detect bacteria. Organisms belonging to genera Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium, together with the Eubacterium rectale/Clostridium coccoides group, the Atopobium, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Eubacterium cylindroides groups, as well as the segmented filamentous bacteria, the Roseburia intestinalis group and lactic acid bacteria, were all present in high numbers in the continuous culture system. Other groups and species such as Ruminococci and Enterobacteria also persisted in the model, though not always at levels that allowed reliable quantitation. Some organisms such as Streptococci and Corynebacteria, present in the faecal inoculum, did not colonize the system. Other probes specific for Eubacterium lentum and for members of the genus Desulfovibrio did not detect these organisms at any time. Short chain fatty acid production was always highest in vessel I of the continuous culture system, however, a marked increase in acetate formation and a reduction in butyrate production occurred when system retention time was reduced to 20 h, which correlated with reductions in the numbers of butyrate-producing Roseburia.
TI  - Effects of alternative dietary substrates on competition between human colonic bacteria in an anaerobic fermentor system.
AB  - Duplicate anaerobic fermentor systems were used to examine changes in a community of human fecal bacteria supplied with different carbohydrate energy sources. A panel of group-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization probes targeting 16S rRNA sequences revealed that the fermentors supported growth of a greater proportion of Bacteroides and a lower proportion of gram-positive anaerobes related to Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Ruminococcus flavefaciens-Ruminococcus bromii, Eubacterium rectale-Clostridium coccoides, and Eubacterium cylindroides than the proportions in the starting fecal inoculum. Nevertheless, certain substrates, such as dahlia inulin, caused a pronounced increase in the number of bacteria related to R. flavefaciens-R. bromii and E. cylindroides. The ability of three strictly anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria to compete with the complete human fecal flora was tested in the same experiment by using selective plating to enumerate the introduced strains. The Roseburia-related strain A2-183(F) was able to grow on all substrates despite the fact that it was unable to utilize complex carbohydrates in pure culture, and it was assumed that this organism survived by cross-feeding. In contrast, Roseburia intestinalis L1-82(R) and Eubacterium sp. strain A2-194(R) survived less well despite the fact that they were able to utilize polysaccharides in pure culture, except that A2-194(R) was stimulated 100-fold by inulin. These results suggest that many low-G+C-content gram-positive obligate anaerobes may be selected against during in vitro incubation, although several groups were stimulated by inulin. Thus, considerable caution is necessary when workers attempt to predict the in vivo effects of probiotics and prebiotics from their effects in vitro.
