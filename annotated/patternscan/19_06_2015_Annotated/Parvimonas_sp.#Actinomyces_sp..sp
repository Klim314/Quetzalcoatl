TI  == antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of phosphoric acid solution compared to other root canal irrigants.
AB  == phosphoric acid has been suggested as an irrigant due to its effectiveness in removing the smear layer. objectives: the purpose of this study was to compare the antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of a 37% phosphoric acid solution to other irrigants commonly used in endodontics. material and methods: the substances 37% phosphoric acid, 17% edta, 10% citric acid, 2% chlorhexidine (solution and gel), and 5.25% naocl were evaluated. the antimicrobial activity was tested against candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, actinomyces meyeri, parvimonas micra, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella nigrescens according to the agar diffusion method. the cytotoxicity of the irrigants was determined by using the mtt assay. results: phosphoric acid presented higher antimicrobial activity compared to the other tested irrigants. with regard to the cell viability, this solution showed results similar to those with 5.25% naocl and 2% chlorhexidine (gel and solution), whereas 17% edta and 10% citric acid showed higher cell viability compared to other irrigants. conclusion: phosphoric acid demonstrated higher antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity similar to that of 5.25% naocl and 2% chlorhexidine (gel and solution).

TI  == a consortium of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus parasanguinis, and filifactor alocis is present in sites prior to bone loss in a  longitudinal study of localized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-induced localized aggressive periodontitis  (lap) in african-american adolescents has been documented but is poorly understood. two thousand fifty-eight adolescents aged 11 to 17 years were screened for their periodontal status and the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans in their oral cavity. seventy-one a. actinomycetemcomitans-negative and 63 a. actinomycetemcomitans-positive periodontally healthy subjects were enrolled, sampled, examined, and radiographed yearly for 3 years. gingival and periodontal pocket depth and attachment levels were recorded. disease presentation was characterized by bone loss (bl). subgingival sites were sampled every 6 months to assess (i) the role of a. actinomycetemcomitans in bl and (ii) the association of a. actinomycetemcomitans  and other microbes in their relationships to bl. sixteen of 63 subjects with a. actinomycetemcomitans developed bl (the other 47 subjects with a. actinomycetemcomitans had no bl). no a. actinomycetemcomitans-negative subjects developed bl. human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) was used for subgingival microbial assessment. on a subject level, pooled data from a. actinomycetemcomitans-positive subjects who remained healthy had higher prevalences of streptococcus and actinomyces species, while a. actinomycetemcomitans-positive subjects with bl had higher prevalences of parvimonas micra, filifactor alocis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and peptostreptococcus sp. human oral taxon 113 (hot-113). at vulnerable sites, a. actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus parasanguinis, and f. alocis levels were elevated prior to bl. in cases where the three-organism consortium (versus a. actinomycetemcomitans alone) was detected, the specificity for detecting sites of future bl increased from 62% to 99%, with a sensitivity of 89%. we conclude that  detecting the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, s. parasanguinis, and f. alocis together indicates sites of future bl in lap. a synergistic interaction of this consortium in lap causation is possible and is the subject of ongoing research.

TI  == microbiota associated with chronic osteomyelitis of the jaws.
AB  == chronic osteomyelitis of maxilla and mandible is rare in industrialized countries and its occurrence in developing countries is associated with trauma and surgery, and its microbial etiology has not been studied thoroughly. the aim of this investigation was to evaluate the microbiota associated with osteomyelitis of mandible or maxilla from some brazilian patients. after clinical and radiographic evaluation, samples of bone sequestra, purulent secretion, and biopsies of granulomatous tissues from twenty-two patients with chronic osteomyelitis of mandible and maxilla were cultivated and submitted for pathogen detection by using a pcr method. each patient harbored a single lesion. bacterial isolation was performed on fastidious anaerobe agar supplemented with hemin, menadione and  horse blood for anaerobes; and on tryptic soy agar supplemented with yeast extract and horse blood for facultative bacteria and aerobes. plates were incubated in anaerobiosis and aerobiosis, at 37(o)c for 14 and 3 days, respectively. bacteria were cultivated from twelve patient samples; and genera actinomyces, fusobacterium, parvimonas, and staphylococcus were the most frequent. by pcr, bacterial dna was detected from sixteen patient samples. the results suggest that cases of chronic osteomyelitis of the jaws are usually mixed anaerobic infections, reinforcing the concept that osteomyelitis of the jaws are  mainly related to microorganisms from the oral environment, and periapical and periodontal infections may act as predisposing factors.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.
