TI  == bacteremia after piezocision.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to investigate the presence of transient  bacteremia after a piezocision procedure. methods: the sample consisted of 30 subjects (24 women, 6 men; mean age, 19.6 +/- 0.7 years; range, 18.1-22.4 years)  with the american society of anesthesiologists' physical status i. all patients had class i skeletal and dental relationships and had fixed orthodontic treatment with the damon system. the piezocision surgery was performed 1 week after the placement of the orthodontic appliances in all patients. two 20-ml venous blood samples were collected before and 30 to 60 seconds after the first microincision  using an aseptic technique. the samples were inoculated into bactec plus aerobic  and anaerobic blood culture bottles and were assessed in the bactec blood culture analyzer (becton dickinson diagnostic instrument systems, sparks, md). the results were analyzed statistically using the mcnemar test, with p <0.05 indicating statistical significance. results: no significant difference between the preoperative and postoperative samples was determined with respect to transient bacteremia (p = 0.250). no bacteremia was detected in the pretreatment  samples, although gemella sanguinis, streptococcus pluranimalium, and streptococcus mitis/oralis were detected in 3 postoperative blood samples. conclusions: the piezocision procedure might be related to transitory bacteremia. hence, orthodontists should consider the possibility of bacterial endocarditis in at-risk patients when piezocision is part of the treatment plan.

TI  == occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  == the distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd, in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. zmpb was ubiquitous in the mitis and salivarius groups of the genus streptococcus and in the genera gemella and granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented  gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. iga1 protease activity was observed in all members of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis, s. sanguinis, and gemella haemolysans, was variably  present in s. mitis and s. infantis, and absent in s. gordonii, s. parasanguinis, s. cristatus, s. oligofermentans, s. australis, s. peroris, and s. suis. phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes  provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpb, and zmpd genes in s. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. the widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpb, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is  likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. importance: the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae. this study maps the presence of the  corresponding genes and enzyme activities in s. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera streptococcus, gemella, and granulicatella. the distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpb is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. the zmpb  protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the mitis and salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. the relative sequence  diversification of the iga1 protease, zmpb, and zmpd is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen s. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.

TI  == white-spot lesions and gingivitis microbiotas in orthodontic patients.
AB  == white-spot lesions (wsl) associated with orthodontic appliances are a cosmetic problem and increase risk for cavities. we characterized the microbiota of wsl, accounting for confounding due to gingivitis. participants were 60 children with  fixed appliances, aged between 10 and 19 yrs, half with wsl. plaque samples were  assayed by a 16s rrna-based microarray (homim) and by pcr. mean gingival index was positively associated with wsl (p = 0.018). taxa associated with wsl by microarray included granulicatella elegans (p = 0.01), veillonellaceae sp. hot 155 (p < 0.01), and bifidobacterium cluster 1 (p = 0.11), and by qpcr, streptococcus mutans (p = 0.008) and scardovia wiggsiae (p = 0.04) taxa associated with gingivitis by microarray included: gemella sanguinis (p = 0.002), actinomyces sp. hot 448 (p = 0.003), prevotella cluster iv (p = 0.021), and streptococcus sp. hot 071/070 (p = 0.023); and levels of s. mutans (p = 0.02) and bifidobacteriaceae (p = 0.012) by qpcr. species' associations with wsl were minimally changed with adjustment for gingivitis level. partial least-squares discriminant analysis yielded good discrimination between children with and those without wsl. granulicatella, veillonellaceae and bifidobacteriaceae, in addition  to s. mutans and s. wiggsiae, were associated with the presence of wsl in adolescents undergoing orthodontic treatment. many taxa showed a stronger association with gingivitis than with wsl.

TI  == effects of preincubation temperature on the detection of fastidious organisms in  delayed-entry samples in the bact/alert 3d blood culture system.
AB  == this study evaluates the effect of preincubation on delayed-entry samples for fastidious organisms including the hacek group, streptococcus species, neisseria  meningitidis, haemophilus species and corynebacterium species for the bact/alert  3d system (biomerieux) using the fa (aerobic) medium. bottles were inoculated with two different concentrations (0.5 mcfarland and a 1:100,000 dilution) of each organism and either loaded into the system immediately or stored at 4 degrees c, room temperature (rt) or 37 degrees c for 24 hours (h) prior to loading. the detection rate (dr) was 92.5% for bottles loaded immediately for both concentrations with a mean time to detection (ttd) of 26.7 h (standard deviation (sd): 14.7 h) for the low concentration and 9.21 h (sd: 5.3 h) for the  high concentration. preincubation at 4 degrees c did not affect the dr for either of the two concentrations in comparison to no preincubation. the dr at rt was 90.0% for the low concentration and 83.6% for the high concentration. at 37 degrees c the dr was 76.3% and 66.3% for the low and the high concentrations respectively. the average ttd was inversely correlated with the preincubation temperature. an incubation of four days was sufficient, with the exception of eikenella corrodens and gemella sanguinis. the serotype of streptococcus pneumoniae or neisseria meningitidis did not influence the ttd. kingella kingae remained undetected. for the retrieval of the above mentioned bacteria we recommend storage of bottles at room temperature. in case of erroneous storage at 37 degrees c subcultivation is advisable. all cases with a negative result on day four should be reevaluated and eventually new material for alternative diagnostic procedures should be retrieved.

TI  == in vitro activity of daptomycin against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == we determined the activity of daptomycin, a recently fda-approved antimicrobial agent, against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria, including viridans group streptococci (16 streptococcus mitis species group, 12 s. mutans species group, 9 s. anginosus species group, 8 s. sanguinis species group, 5 s. salivarius species group) from patients with infective endocarditis, 32 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 32 high-level penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, 38 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (including 1 linezolid-resistant isolate), and the following unusual gram-positive bacteria: 3 listeria monocytogenes, 4 erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, 9 corynebacterium species, 10 abiotrophia/granulicatella species, 2 rothia (stomatococcus) mucilaginosus, and 4 gemella morbillorum. daptomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)(90) values for the viridans group streptococci, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, and enterococcus species were 0.5, 0.5, < or =0.125, and 4 microg/ml, respectively. the daptomycin mic range for the unusual gram-positive bacteria was < or =0.125-2 microg/ml. we conclude that daptomycin has in vitro activity against viridans group streptococci associated with endocarditis as well as against several types  of unusual gram-positive bacteria that can cause endocarditis.

TI  == immunoglobulin a1 protease activity in gemella haemolysans.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the occurrence and nature of immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) protease activity in members of the genus gemella and related taxa. among a total of 22 gemella strains belonging to the four species gemella haemolysans, gemella morbillorum, gemella sanguinis, and gemella bergeriae and four reference strains of the species helcococcus kunzii, facklamia hominis, and globicatella sanguinis, iga1 protease activity was an exclusive character of all nine isolates of g. haemolysans. the iga1 protease of g. haemolysans appears to be a metallo-type iga1 protease that cleaves the pro(227)-thr(228) peptide bond in the hinge region of the alpha1 chain like that  of several streptococcus species. phenotypic characterization of the isolates demonstrates that screening for iga1 protease activity provides a valuable means  for species differentiation in this group of bacteria.
