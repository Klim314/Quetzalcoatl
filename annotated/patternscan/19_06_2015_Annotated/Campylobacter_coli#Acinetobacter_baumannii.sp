TI  == [antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 produced by enterococcus faecium strain lwp760].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 (enterocin) produced by enterococcusfaecium strain lwp760 was studied. bacteriocin s760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kda and pl  of 9.8. enterocin s760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive  and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. mics of the bacteriocin s760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for escherichia  coli 0157:h117, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and corynebacterium diphteriae. it is also active against antibioticresistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter baumannii (with mics of 0.05-3 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (with mics of 6 mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of candida albicans, candida krusei and aspergillus niger (with mics of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). enterocin s760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.

TI  == [ciprofloxacin resistance in gram negative bacilli. epidemiologic aspects].
AB  == background: the aim of the present was to study the resistance to ciprofloxacin (cip) in gram negative bacilli (april 1990-march 1992) and to determine the temporary distribution of the resistant strains by species, samples and departments. methods: seven thousand four hundred seventy-eight samples were studied. the identification and determination of the sensitivity was performed by the pasco (difco) system. haemophilus spp. and campylobacter spp. were excluded from the study. the microorganisms with cim 2 mg/l were considered as resistant (cipr). results: four hundred eighty-one cipr isolations were identified (6.4%).  with regard to the percentage of resistant strains, the species with the highest  were: providencia stuartii (50%); pseudomonas cepacia (44.4%); xanthomonas maltophilia (26.9%); acinetobacter baumannii (25.8%); pseudomonas aeruginosa (16%); citrobacter freundii (12.5%); serratia marcescens (8.4%); enterobacter cloacae (5.8%) and escherichia coli (4.3%). with respect to the absolute number of resistant strains, the most frequent resistant strains were: p. aeruginosa (205), e. coli (144), and a. baumannii (41). isolation of e. coli and a. baumannii cipr increased over the study period. forty-four point five percent of  the e. coli cipr were of extrahospitalary origin; most of the a. baumannii (92.9%) and p. aeruginosa (77.6%) in contrast were of intrahospitalary origin. conclusions: p. aeruginosa, e. coli, and a. baumannii are the most frequently resistant species. the frequency of isolation of resistant strains of e. coli and a. baumannii significantly increased (p < 0.001) over the two years of the study.
