TI  == ataa, a new member of the trimeric autotransporter adhesins from acinetobacter sp. tol 5 mediating high adhesiveness to various abiotic surfaces.
AB  == acinetobacter sp. tol 5 exhibits an autoagglutinating nature and noteworthy adhesiveness to various abiotic surfaces from hydrophobic plastics to hydrophilic glass and stainless steel. although previous studies have suggested that bacterionanofibers on tol 5 cells are involved in the adhesive phenotype of tol 5, the fiber that directly mediates tol 5 adhesion has remained unknown. here, we present a new member of trimeric autotransporter adhesins designated ataa, which  we discovered by analyzing a less adhesive mutant of tol 5, t1, obtained by transposon mutagenesis. ataa forms thinner and shorter nanofibers than fimbriae on tol 5 cells. we performed target disruption of ataa by allelic marker exchange, and the resulting deltaataa strain was complemented with ataa on the escherichia coli-acinetobacter shuttle vector, which was newly constructed. these results proved that ataa is essential for tol 5's autoagglutinating nature and high adhesiveness to surfaces of various materials. in addition, the adhesiveness to solid surfaces mediated by ataa is notably higher than that mediated by yada of yersinia enterocolitica wa-314. moreover, and importantly, these characteristics can be conferred to the non-adhesive, non-agglutinating bacterium acinetobacter sp. adp1 in trans by transformation with ataa, with expected applications to microbial immobilization.

TI  == plant-specific promoter sequences carry elements that are recognised by the eubacterial transcription machinery.
AB  == during evolution the promoter elements from prokaryotes and eukaryotes have developed differently with regard to their sequence and structure, implying that  in general a transfer of eukaryotic promoter sequences into prokaryotes will not  cause an efficient gene expression. however, there have been reports on the functionality of the 35s promoter from cauliflower mosaic virus (camv) in bacteria. we therefore decided to experimentally investigate the capability of plant promoter sequences to direct gene expression in various bacteria. accordingly, we tested ten different plant-specific promoters from solanum tuberosum, nicotiana tabacum, camv, agrobacterium tumefaciens, and a. rhizogenes  for their ability to initiate transcription in five different eubacterial species (escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, a. tumefaciens, pseudomonas putida, and acinetobacter sp. bd413). to monitor the strength of the plant-specific promoters in bacteria we created fusions between these promoters and the coding region of the luciferase genes from vibrio harveyi and measured the luminescence  in the bacteria. heterologous gene expression was observed in 50% of the combinations analysed. we then mapped the transcription start site caused by one  of the plant-specific promoters, the st-ls1 promoter from s. tuberosum, in these  bacterial species. the location of the mapped transcription start site indicated  that the sequences of the plant promoter themselves were recognised by the bacterial transcription apparatus. the recognition of plant-specific promoter sequences by the bacterial rna polymerase was further confirmed by site-directed  mutagenesis of the st-ls1 promoter and the analysis of the effects of the mutations on the strength of gene expression in e. coli. using these mutants in our reporter assays we could localise the sequences of the st-ls1 promoter serving as -10 region in e. coli. the results of our study show that promoter sequences are much less specific than is generally assumed. this is of great importance for our knowledge about the evolution of gene expression systems and for the construction of optimised expression vectors.

TI  == a comparative study of the bbl crystal enteric/nonfermenter identification system and the biomerieux api20e and api20ne identification systems after overnight incubation.
AB  == the bbl crystal enteric/nonfermenter (crystal, becton dickinson microbiology systems) is a new multi-test identification system for gram negative rods requiring no oil overlay or addition of reagents. one hundred and three selected  gram negative rod isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested in parallel using the appropriate api20e or api20ne (biomerieux) reading after overnight incubation. the isolates included in the study, and the number tested,  were as follows: acinetobacter sp, 8; aeromonas hydrophila, 1; citrobacter diversus, 1; citrobacter freundii, 1; escherichia coli, 13; enterobacter aerogenes, 10; enterobacter agglomerans, 2; enterobacter cloacae, 6; klebsiella oxytoca, 6; klebsiella pneumoniae, 12; morganella morganii, 2; proteus mirabilis, 6; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21; salmonella sp, 2; salmonella typhi, 1; serratia marcescens, 1; shigella sonnei, 2; shigella sp, 2; vibrio metschnikovii, 1; xanthomonas maltophilia, 3; and, yersinia enterocolitica, 2. the api20e and api20ne systems combined identified 74.8% (77/103) and the crystal 97.1% (100/103) of isolates. twenty six isolates required repeat and/or additional tests for correct identification with the api systems compared to 3 with the crystal. crystal is more convenient than api for routine clinical use because it  requires fewer repeat and/or extra tests, and is easier and less time consuming to use.

TI  == variability of peptidoglycan structural parameters in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == muropeptide composition of peptidoglycan from the gram-negative bacteria aeromonas sp., acinetobacter acetoaceticus, agrobacterium tumefaciens, enterobacter cloacae, proteus morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, vibrio parahaemolyticus yersinia enterocolitica and escherichia coli, was analyzed by hplc. in all instances peptidoglycan was built up from the same subunits. a wide disparity in the relative abundance of muropeptides and all structural parameters was observed. the contribution of ld-a2pm-a2pm cross-linked muropeptides was extremely variable; from 1 to 45% of cross-linked muropeptides.  muropeptides with the dipeptides lys-lys or arg-lys, indicative of murein-bound (lipo)proteins, were detected in all instances although abundance was very variable.
