TI  == oral microbiota shift after 12-week supplementation with lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289; a randomized control trial.
AB  == background: lactobacillus spp. potentially contribute to health by modulating bacterial biofilm formation, but their effects on the overall oral microbiota remain unclear. methods and findings: oral microbiota was characterized via 454-pyrosequencing of the 16s rdna hypervariable region v3-v4 after 12 weeks of daily lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289 consumption. forty-four adults were assigned to a test group (n = 22) that received lactobacilli lozenges (108 cfu of each strain/lozenge) or a control group that received placebo (n = 22). presence of l. reuteri was confirmed by cultivation and species specific pcr. tooth biofilm samples from 16 adults before, during, and after exposure were analyzed by pyrosequencing. a total of 1,310,292 sequences were quality filtered. after removing single reads, 257 species or phylotypes were identified at 98.5% identity in the human oral microbiome database. firmicutes, bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, proteobacteria, and actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. streptococcus was the most common genus and the s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group comprised the dominant species. the number of observed species was unaffected by l. reuteri exposure. however, subjects who had consumed l. reuteri were clustered in a principal coordinates analysis relative to scattering at baseline, and multivariate modeling of pyrosequencing microbiota, and culture and pcr detected l. reuteri separated baseline from 12-week samples in test subjects. l. reuteri intake correlated with increased s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group and campylobacter concisus, granulicatella adiacens, bergeyella sp. hot322, neisseria subflava, and sr1 [g-1] sp. hot874 detection and reduced s. mutans, s. anginosus, n. mucosa, fusobacterium periodicum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, and prevotella maculosa detection. this effect had disappeared 1 month after exposure was terminated. conclusions: l. reuteri consumption did not affect species richness but induced a shift in the oral microbiota composition. the biological relevance of this remains to be elucidated. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct02311218.

TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of subgingival microbiota in distinct periodontal conditions.
AB  == subgingival microorganisms are potentially associated with periodontal diseases.  however, changes in the subgingival microbiota during the progress of periodontal diseases are poorly understood. in this study, we analyzed bacterial communities  in the subgingival paper point samples from 32 korean individuals with no sign of disease, gingivitis, or periodontitis using 454 flx titanium pyrosequencing. a total of 256,113 reads representing 26 phyla, 433 genera, and 1,016 species were  detected. bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, synergistetes, and spirochaetes were the abundant phyla in periodontitis subjects, whereas firmicutes and proteobacteria were identified as the dominant phyla in the gingivitis and healthy subjects, respectively. although high levels of porphyromonas, fusobacterium, fretibacterium, rothia, filifactor, and treponema genera were observed in the periodontitis subjects, streptococcus, capnocytophaga, leptotrichia, and haemophilus genera were found at high frequency in the gingivitis subjects. species including porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and fretibacterium fastidiosum were significantly increased in periodontitis subjects. on the other hand, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, and leptotrichia hongkongensis were preferentially observed in the gingivitis subjects. intriguingly, the halophile halomonas hamiltonii was revealed as a predominant species in the healthy subjects. based on fast unifrac  analysis, distinctive bacterial clusters were classified for the healthy, gingivitis, and periodontitis state. the current findings might be useful for understanding the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of periodontal diseases.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of synthetic antimicrobial decapeptide against oral bacteria].
AB  == objective: this study aims to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide, a novel antimicrobial peptide, against several major cariogenic and periodontopathogenic bacteria in vitro. methods in this study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide against streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and saccharomyces albicans in vitro using the agar diffusion method and broth dilution method. furthermore, a time-kill kinetic study of decapeptide against s. mutans was performed. results: the results showed that decapeptide exhibited antimicrobial activity against various  oral bacteria and fungi. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of main cariogenic bacteria ranged from 62.5 mug . ml(-1) to 125 mug . ml(-1), and the mic of periodontopathogenic bacteria tested ranged from 250 mug . ml(-1) to 1,000 mug . ml(-1). among the bacteria tested, decapeptide had a strong inhibitory effect on cariogenic s. mutans. results of the time-kill kinetic studies showed that decapeptide reduced the viable counts of s. mutans by more than one order of magnitude after 20 min of incubation, and thoroughly killed s. mutans after 30 min. no viable cells could be detected after 24 h of incubation. conclusion: this study suggest that decapeptide might have potential clinical application in treating dental caries by killing s. mutans within dental plaque.

TI  == primate pulpal healing after exposure and theracal application.
AB  == aim: the purpose of this in vivo study was to compare the effectiveness of a new  light cured resin based dicalcium/tricalcium silicate pulp capping material (theracallc, bisco), pure portland cement, resin based calcium hydroxide or glass ionomer in the healing of bacterially contaminated primate pulps. study design: the experiment required four primates each having 12 teeth prepared with buccal penetrations into the pulpal tissues with an exposure of approximately 1.0 mm. the exposed pulps of the primate teeth were covered with cotton pellets soaked in a bacterial mixture consisting of microorganisms normally found in human pulpal abscesses. after removal of the pellet, hemostasis was obtained and the pulp capping agents applied. the light cured resin based pulp capping material (theracal lc) was applied to the pulpal tissue of twelve teeth with a needle tip  syringe and light cured for 15 seconds. pure portland cement mixed with a 2% chlorhexidine solution was placed on the exposed pulpal tissues of another twelve teeth. twelve additional teeth had a base of gic applied (triage, fuji vii gc america) and another twelve had a pulp cap with vlc dycal (dentsply), a light cured calcium hydroxide resin based material. the pulp capping bases were then covered with a rmgi (fuji ii lc gc america). the tissue samples were collected at 4 weeks. the samples were deminerilized, sectioned, stained and histologically graded. results: there were no statistically significant differences between the  groups in regard to pulpal inflammation (h = 0.679, p = 1.00). however, both the  portland cement and light cured theracal lc groups had significantly more frequent hard tissue bridge formation at 28 days than the gic and vlc dycal groups (h = 11.989, p = 0.009). the measured thickness of the hard tissue bridges with the pure portland and light cured theracal lc groups were statistically greater than that of the other two groups (h = 15.849, p = 0.002). in addition, the occurrence of pulpal necrosis was greater with the gic group than the others. four premolars, one each treated according to the protocols were analyzed with a  microct machine. the premolar treated with the light cured theracal lc demonstrated a complete hard tissue bridge. the premolar treated with the gic did not show a complete hard tissue bridge while the premolar treated with vlc dycal  had an incomplete bridge. the pure portland with chlorhexidine mixture created extensive hard tissue bridging. conclusion: theracal lc applied to primate pulps  created dentin bridges and mild inflammation acceptable for pulp capping.

TI  == nanoparticle-encapsulated chlorhexidine against oral bacterial biofilms.
AB  == background: chlorhexidine (chx) is a widely used antimicrobial agent in dentistry. herein, we report the synthesis of a novel mesoporous silica nanoparticle-encapsulated pure chx (nano-chx), and its mechanical profile and antimicrobial properties against oral biofilms. methodology/principal findings: the release of chx from the nano-chx was characterized by uv/visible absorption spectroscopy. the antimicrobial properties of nano-chx were evaluated in both planktonic and biofilm modes of representative oral pathogenic bacteria. the nano-chx demonstrated potent antibacterial effects on planktonic bacteria and mono-species biofilms at the concentrations of 50-200 microg/ml against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and enterococccus faecalis. moreover, nano-chx effectively suppressed multi-species biofilms such as s. mutans, f. nucleatum, a. actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis up to 72 h. conclusions/significance: this pioneering study demonstrates the potent antibacterial effects of the nano-chx on oral biofilms, and it may be developed as a novel and promising anti-biofilm agent for clinical use.

TI  == development of an in vitro periodontal biofilm model for assessing antimicrobial  and host modulatory effects of bioactive molecules.
AB  == background: inflammation within the oral cavity occurs due to dysregulation between microbial biofilms and the host response. understanding how different oral hygiene products influence inflammatory properties is important for the development of new products. therefore, creation of a robust host-pathogen biofilm platform capable of evaluating novel oral healthcare compounds is an attractive option. we therefore devised a multi-species biofilm co-culture model  to evaluate the naturally derived polyphenol resveratrol (rsv) and gold standard  chlorhexidine (chx) with respect to anti-biofilm and anti-inflammatory properties. methods: an in vitro multi-species biofilm containing s. mitis, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans was created to represent a  disease-associated biofilm and the oral epithelial cell in okf6-tert2. cytotoxicity studies were performed using rsv and chx. multi-species biofilms were either treated with either molecule, or alternatively epithelial cells were  treated with these prior to biofilm co-culture. biofilm composition was evaluated and inflammatory responses quantified at a transcriptional and protein level. results: chx was toxic to epithelial cells and multi-species biofilms at concentrations ranging from 0.01-0.2%. rsv did not effect multi-species biofilm composition, but was toxic to epithelial cells at concentrations greater than 0.01%. in co-culture, chx-treated biofilms resulted in down regulation of the inflammatory chemokine il-8 at both mrna and protein level. rsv-treated epithelial cells in co-culture were down-regulated in the release of il-8 protein, but not mrna. conclusions: chx possesses potent bactericidal properties, which may impact downstream inflammatory mediators. rsv does not appear to have bactericidal properties against multi-species biofilms, however it did appear to  supress epithelial cells from releasing inflammatory mediators. this study demonstrates the potential to understand the mechanisms by which different oral hygiene products may influence gingival inflammation, thereby validating the use  of a biofilm co-culture model.

TI  == colonisation of gingival epithelia by subgingival biofilms in vitro: role of "red complex" bacteria.
AB  == objectives: biofilm formation on tooth surface results in colonisation and invasion of the juxtaposed gingival tissue, eliciting strong inflammatory responses that lead to periodontal disease. this in vitro study investigated the  colonisation of human gingival multi-layered epithelium by multi-species subgingival biofilms, and evaluated the relative effects of the "red complex" species (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola). methods: the grown biofilm consisted of fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, veillonella dispar, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, t. denticola, actinomyces oris, streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus oralis, or its variant lacking the "red complex". after 48h in co-culture with the gingival epithelia, the bacterial species in the biofilm were quantified, whereas their localisation on the cell surface was investigated by combining confocal-laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation  (fish), as well as by scanning electron microscopy (sem). results: exclusion of the "red complex" quantitatively affected s. oralis, but not other species. the "red-complex" species were all able to colonise the gingival epithelial cells. a  co-localisation trend was observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola, as determined by fish. however, in the absence of all three "red complex" bacteria from the biofilm, an immense colonisation of streptococci (potentially s. oralis) was observed on the gingival epithelia, as confirmed by both clsm and sem. conclusions: while the "red complex" species synergise in colonizing gingival epithelia, their absence from the biofilm enhances streptococcal colonisation. this antagonism with streptococci reveals that the "red complex" may regulate biofilm virulence, with potential implications in periodontal pathogenesis.

TI  == clinical and microbiological characterization of localized aggressive periodontitis: a cohort study.
AB  == background: localized aggressive periodontitis (lagp) is an infectious periodontal disease which generally affects young people. recent data suggest the involvement of different bacterial species in different populations. the causative bacterial species in israel has never been identified despite a high prevalence of lagp in this population. the objectives of this study were to characterize the bacterial microbiota of periodontal pockets within an israeli lagp population who were also clinically assessed. methods: twenty-one lagp patients (test) and 12 chronic periodontitis patients (control) were examined. bacterial samples were collected from periodontal pockets and analysed by both culture and polymerase chain reaction techniques. mann-whitney u test and chi-square test were used to compare results between the groups. results: higher  levels of parvimonas micra (>10(6) ), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (>10(5) ), fusobacterium nucleatum/f. periodonticum (>10(6) ), and tannerella forsythia (levels of 10(5) to 10(6) bacteria) were detected in the lagp group compared to the control (p < 0.05), while levels of porphyromonas gingivalis and  prevotella intermedia were higher in the cp group. conclusions: the characteristic periodontal bacterial flora of lagp patients in israel is mainly comprised of p. micra, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum/f. periodonticum and t. forsythia. similar population based studies of each population will improve the quality of treatment of lagp when individual sampling is not possible.

TI  == evaluation of periodontal pathogens of the mandibular third molar pericoronitis by using real time pcr.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to investigate the mandibular third molar pericoronitis flora by using real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). materials and methods: the quantitative values of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), campylobacter rectus (cr), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi) and tannerella forsythia (tf) were evaluated in comparison with the healthy third molar flora by using real time pcr. results: aa, cr, pg, and pi were not statistically significant but numerically higher than the pericoronitis group. in contrast to samples from control subjects, statistically significant higher numbers of tf were detected in samples from pericoronitis patients. the study revealed the strong relation between risk of pericoronitis and the presence of tf. individuals who have tf in  their samples present with an almost eight times relative risk of pericoronitis as the individuals with an absence of tf in their samples. conclusion: tf plays an important role in the development of clinical symptoms related to pericoronitis.

TI  == antibacterial action of chlorhexidine/thymol containing varnishes in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == objectives: the antibacterial activity of two different formulations of a chlorhexidine/thymol varnish should be elucidated in vitro and in vivo. methods:  the agar diffusion assay with cervitec((r)) and cervitecplus((r)) and three reference strains each of streptococci, lactobacilli, actinomyces and periodontal pathogens was performed. in a split-mouth study, 40 volunteers applied the test (cervitecplus((r)), solvent water and ethanol) and control (cervitec((r)), solvent ethyl acetate) varnish at buccal recessions of premolar teeth at baseline as well as after two, four and seven days. supra- and subgingival plaques were collected 2 weeks before baseline and at the screening appointments. supragingival plaque was analysed for mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and subgingival samples for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and porphyromonas intermedia. friedman/wilcoxon tests and u-test were used for statistical analysis (p < 0.05). results: most reference strains were susceptible with inhibition zones (mm) as follows: cervitec((r))/cervitecplus((r)) streptococci 27 +/- 1.7/21.3 +/- 2.5, lactobacilli 26 +/- 9.2/23.7 +/- 4.9, actinomyces 36.3 +/- 6.6/27.3 +/- 1.5, periodontal pathogens 18.7 +/- 7.6/18 +/- 1.7. both varnishes reduced significantly the counts of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in the patients. however, no significant differences were found between test and control sides at  any time. the total counts of periodontal pathogens were low. a tendency to higher counts of a. actinomycetemcomitans at the control side could be shown; the test side did not harbour significantly higher counts. conclusion: both varnishes may influence the plaque formation and reduce mutans streptococci in supragingival plaque.

TI  == combinatorial effects of amoxicillin and metronidazole on selected periodontal bacteria and whole plaque samples.
AB  == objective: the aim of the present study was to analyze in vitro the combinatorial effects of the antibiotic combination of amoxicillin plus metronidazole on subgingival bacterial isolates. design: aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum  and eikenella corrodens from our strain collection and subgingival bacteria isolated from patients with periodontitis were tested for their susceptibility to amoxicillin and metronidazole using the etest. the fractional inhibitory concentration index (fici), which is commonly used to describe drug interactions, was calculated. results: synergy, i.e. fici values </= 0.5, between amoxicillin and metronidazole was shown for two a. actinomycetemcomitans (fici: 0.3), two f.  nucleatum (fici: 0.3 and 0.5, respectively) and one e. corrodens (fici: 0.4) isolates. indifference, i.e. fic indices of >0.5 but </=4, occurred for other isolates and the 14 p. intermedia/nigrescens strains tested. microorganisms resistant to either amoxicillin or metronidazole were detected in all samples by  etest. conclusion: combinatorial effects occur between amoxicillin and metronidazole on some strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and e. corrodens. synergy was shown for a few strains only.

TI  == acute appendicitis in children is associated with an abundance of bacteria from the phylum fusobacteria.
AB  == background: although luminal obstruction has traditionally been viewed as the underlying cause of appendicitis, recent evidence has suggested that the disease  may result directly from invasion by specific pathogens, e.g. fusobacterium nucleatum. the purpose of this study was to survey microbial communities within pediatric appendectomy specimens using a culture-independent approach. methods: we performed 16s ribosomal gene sequence analysis to profile the microbiota present within luminal fluid obtained from 22 pediatric appendectomy specimens. these included 10 simple appendicitis cases, 5 perforated appendicitis cases, 2 interval appendectomies, and 5 incidental appendectomies. results: samples could  be divided into 2 distinct clusters based upon the composition of the appendiceal bacterial communities. appendicitis samples contained an increased abundance of fusobacterium spp. and a reduced abundance of bacteroides spp. relative to non-appendicitis cases. appendicitis samples also contained variable amounts of other oral taxa such as porphyromonas, parvimonas, and gemella, whereas these taxa were generally absent from non-appendicitis samples. conclusions: acute appendicitis is associated with an abundance of fusobacterium spp. and other pathogens commonly found in the oral cavity. further research is needed to determine whether these organisms directly cause appendicitis or rather proliferate in the appendix as a secondary consequence of inflammation.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of various saturated fatty acids (sfa) and unsaturated fatty acids (usfa) against different oral pathogens which are implicated in the cause of dental caries, stomatitis, gingivitis, and periodontitis was examined. the saturated fatty acids pa, sta and ara, and the unsaturated omega-7 fatty acids pla and omega-9 fatty acids oa showed either none to low antimicrobial activity against all of the 12 oral pathogenic strains used in this study. in contrast, the omega-3 pufas, ala, sda, epa and dha, and the omega-6 pufas, la, gla, and aa showed considerable antimicrobial activity against 8, 7, 6 and 5 strains, and 6, 10 and 5 strains, respectively. in particular, the omega-3 and omega-6 pufas showed strong antimicrobial activity against porphyromonas gingivalis kctc 381, the cause of periodontitis, and against aggregatibacter segnis kctc 5968, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum kctc 5172 and prevotella intermedia kctc 25611, all organisms implicated in the cause of gingivitis. to date, no bacterial resistance to free fatty acids has been encountered and no resistance phenotype has emerged. therefore, these results suggest that pufas may be useful in the development of therapeutic agents for oral diseases, and in particular, in the development of agents that have minimal  side effects and against which there is no bacterial resistance.

TI  == effect of bacteria on the wound healing behavior of oral epithelial cells.
AB  == wounded tissue offers opportunity to microflora to adhere, colonize, invade and infect surrounding healthy tissue. the bacteria of the oral cavity have the potential to alter the wound healing process by interacting with keratinocytes. the aim of this study was to investigate mechanisms through which oral bacteria may influence re-epithelialization by interacting with gingival keratinocytes. by an in vitro scratch assay we demonstrate that primary gingival keratinocytes have impaired closure when exposed to two well characterized oral bacteria, p. gingivalis, and to a lesser extent, f. nucleatum. p. gingivalis reduced wound closure by approximately 40%, which was partially dependent on proteolytic activity, and bacteria was still present within infected cells 9 days later despite exposure to bacteria for only 24 h. both oral bacteria caused keratinocyte apoptosis at the wound site with cell death being greatest at the wound edge. p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum adversely affected cell proliferation  and the effect also had a spatial component being most striking at the edge. the  impact of the bacteria was long lasting even when exposure was brief. cell migration was compromised in bacteria challenged keratinocytes with p. gingivalis having more severe effect (p<0.05) than f. nucleatum. quantitative real time pcr  of bacteria challenged cells showed that p. gingivalis and to a lesser extent f.  nucleatum significantly downregulated cell cycle genes cyclin1, cdk1, and cdk4 (p<0.05) that are critical for gi/s transition. further, genes associated with cell migration such as integrin beta-3 and -6 were significantly downregulated by p. gingivalis (p<0.05).

TI  == transcriptional responses of treponema denticola to other oral bacterial species.
AB  == the classic organization by socransky and coworkers categorized the oral bacteria of the subgingival plaque into different complexes. treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia are grouped into the red complex that is highly correlated with periodontal disease. socransky's work closely associates red with orange complex species such as fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia but not with members of the other complexes.  while the relationship between species contained by these complexes is in part supported by their ability to physically attach to each other, the physiological  consequences of these interactions and associations are less clear. in this study, we employed t. denticola as a model organism to analyze contact-dependent  responses to interactions with species belonging to the same complex (p. gingivalis and t. forsythia), the closely associated orange complex (using f. nucleatum and p. intermedia as representatives) and the unconnected yellow complex (using streptococcus sanguinis and s. gordonii as representatives). rna was extracted from t. denticola alone as well as after pairwise co-incubation for 5 hrs with representatives of the different complexes, and the respective gene expression profiles were determined using microarrays. numerous genes related to  motility, metabolism, transport, outer membrane and hypothetical proteins were differentially regulated in t. denticola in the presence of the tested partner species. further analysis revealed a significant overlap in the affected genes and we identified a general response to the presence of other species, those specific to two of the three complexes as well as individual complexes. most interestingly, many predicted major antigens (e.g. flagella, msp, ctlp) were suppressed in responses that included red complex species indicating that the presence of the most closely associated species induces immune-evasive strategies. in summary, the data presented here provide an in-depth understanding of the transcriptional responses triggered by contact-dependent interactions between microorganisms inhabiting the periodontal pocket.

TI  == short-chain fatty acids from periodontal pathogens suppress histone deacetylases, ezh2, and suv39h1 to promote kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus replication.
AB  == periodontal pathogens such as porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum produce five different short-chain fatty acids (scfas) as metabolic by-products. we detect significantly higher levels of scfas in the saliva of patients with severe periodontal disease. the different scfas stimulate lytic gene expression of kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) dose dependently and synergistically. scfas inhibit class-1/2 histone deacetylases (hdacs) and downregulate expression of silent information regulator-1 (sirt1). scfas also downregulate expression of enhancer of zeste homolog2 (ezh2) and suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog1 (suv39h1), which are two histone n-lysine  methyltransferases (hlmts). by suppressing the different components of host epigenetic regulatory machinery, scfas increase histone acetylation and decrease  repressive histone trimethylations to transactivate the viral chromatin. these new findings provide mechanistic support that scfas from periodontal pathogens stimulate kshv replication and infection in the oral cavity and are potential risk factors for development of oral kaposi's sarcoma (ks). importance: about 20% of ks patients develop ks lesions first in the oral cavity, while other patients  never develop oral ks. it is not known if the oral microenvironment plays a role  in oral ks tumor development. in this work, we demonstrate that a group of metabolic by-products, namely, short-chain fatty acids, from bacteria that cause  periodontal disease promote lytic replication of kshv, the etiological agent associated with ks. these new findings provide mechanistic support that periodontal pathogens create a unique microenvironment in the oral cavity that contributes to kshv replication and development of oral ks.

TI  == prevotella intermedia induces severe bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia in mice with upregulated platelet-activating factor receptor expression.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of respiratory infection worldwide. although oral hygiene has been considered a risk factor for developing pneumonia, the relationship between oral bacteria and pneumococcal infection is unknown. in  this study, we examined the synergic effects of prevotella intermedia, a major periodontopathic bacterium, on pneumococcal pneumonia. the synergic effects of the supernatant of p. intermedia (pisup) on pneumococcal pneumonia were investigated in mice, and the stimulation of pneumococcal adhesion to human alveolar (a549) cells by pisup was assessed. the effects of pisup on platelet-activating factor receptor (pafr) transcript levels in vitro and in vivo were analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr, and the differences between the effects of pneumococcal infection induced by various periodontopathic bacterial species were verified in mice. mice inoculated with s. pneumoniae plus pisup exhibited a significantly lower survival rate, higher bacterial loads in the lungs, spleen, and blood, and higher inflammatory cytokine levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (macrophage inflammatory protein 2 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) than those infected without pisup. in a549 cells, pisup increased pneumococcal adhesion and pafr transcript levels. pisup also increased  lung pafr transcript levels in mice. similar effects were not observed in the supernatants of porphyromonas gingivalis or fusobacterium nucleatum. thus, p. intermedia has the potential to induce severe bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia with enhanced pneumococcal adhesion to lower airway cells.

TI  == photodynamic antimicrobial effect of safranine o on an ex vivo periodontal biofilm.
AB  == background and objective: the increasing resistance of oral pathogens against antibiotic measures urgently requires new therapeutic strategies. in this context, antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) may play a crucial part in the future. the aim of the present study was to compare the antibacterial efficiency  of apdt using the photosensitizer safranine o with that of chlorhexidine (0.2% chx) on an ex vivo biofilm. methods: first the antibacterial activity of both measures against planktonic cultures of streptococcus gordonii atcc 33399, streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans atcc 33384 and porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 was observed. then a patient specific ex vivo biofilm was established  from plaque and saliva samples of patients (n = 19) with chronic periodontitis. the antibacterial effects of apdt and of 0.2% chx were determined on the ex vivo  biofilms cultivated for 24 and 72 hours. after cultivation of the treated samples on blood agar (2 days) the results were quantified by counting the colony forming units (cfu/ml). results: photodynamic treatment with safranine o showed a distinct antibacterial effect on f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. whereas s. gordonii was suppressed completely by apdt, treatment with 0.2% chx caused only a partial reduction. in the ex vivo biofilm model (24-hour biofilm), apdt caused a  significantly higher bacterial killing than treatment with 0.2% chx. compared to  the untreated control, there was no significant difference on the 72-hour biofilm for both methods. conclusions: the results show that oral-pathogenic species in planktonic solution can be suppressed significantly by apdt with safranine o. especially for bacteria in a 24-hour ex vivo biofilm, this method is more effective than treatment with 0.2% chx. both antibacterial treatments did not show any significant effect on the biofilm cultivated for 72 hours.

AB  == objectives: orthodontic appliances can promote accumulation of dental plaque, with associated enamel decalcification or gingival inflammation. the aim of this  study was to examine longer-term microbiological changes during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. materials and methods: twenty-four orthodontic patients aged 11-14 years undergoing fixed appliance therapy were recruited into  the study. each was randomized for cross-mouth assignment of molar bands and bonded molar tubes to contralateral quadrants of the mouth. all patients received self-ligating brackets, but again using randomization, one upper lateral incisor  bracket (left or right) also received an elastomeric ligature. plaque samples from the molars and upper lateral incisors were obtained at intervals during treatment and up to 1 year after appliance removal. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16s rdna microarray were used to compare plaque microbial fingerprints. results: plaque populations changed within 3 months of commencing treatment at all sites. the greatest differences in plaque composition were seen  with self-ligating brackets with an elastomeric ligature. post-treatment plaque associated with both types of molar attachment contained increased levels of periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and eubacterium nodatum, while campylobacter rectus, parvimonas micra, and actinomyces odontolyticus were also elevated with bonds. conclusions: the results suggest that orthodontic treatment may cause sustained changes in plaque microbiotas and that molar bond-associated plaque may have raised disease potential.

TI  == impact of early colonizers on in vitro subgingival biofilm formation.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of early colonizing species on the structure and the composition of the bacterial community developing in a subgingival 10-species biofilm model system. the model included streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, actinomycesoris, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp.  nucleatum, veillonella dispar, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. based on literature, we considered streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, and actinomyces oris as early colonizers and examined their role in the biofilms by either a delayed addition to the consortium, or by not inoculating at all the biofilms with these species. we quantitatively evaluated the resulting biofilms by real-time quantitative pcr and further compared the structures using confocal  laser scanning microscopy following fluorescence in situ hybridisation. the absence of the early colonizers did not hinder biofilm formation. the biofilms reached the same total counts and developed to normal thickness. however, quantitative shifts in the abundances of individual species were observed. in the absence of streptococci, the overall biofilm structure appeared looser and more dispersed. moreover, besides a significant increase of p. intermedia and a decrease of p. gingivalis , p. intermedia appeared to form filamented long chains that resembled streptococci. a. oris, although growing to significantly higher abundance in absence of streptococci, did not have a visible impact on the biofilms. hence, in the absence of the early colonizers, there is a pronounced effect on p. intermedia and p. gingivalis that may cause distinct shifts in the structure of the biofilm. streptococci possibly facilitate the establishment of p. gingivalis into subgingival biofilms, while in their absence p. intermedia became more dominant and forms elongated chains.

TI  == dental caries and microbiota in children with black stain and non-discoloured dental plaque.
AB  == aim: we aimed to assess caries experience and microbiota in systemically healthy  children with black stain (bs) and non-discoloured plaque. methods: forty-six children with bs and 47 counterparts with non-discoloured plaque aged 7.9 +/- 1.3 years were clinically examined. dental caries was scored using who criteria. samples of bs and non-discoloured dental plaque were collected from tooth surfaces. the dna of the samples was extracted and real-time pcr was performed to determine the total number of bacteria and the species streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus sp., actinomyces naeslundii, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. results: children with bs had lower dmft (p = 0.013), lower dt values (p = 0.005) and a tendency to lower caries prevalence (p = 0.061) than children with non-discoloured plaque. plaque samples of the bs group contained higher numbers of a. naeslundii (p = 0.005) and lower numbers of f. nucleatum (p = 0.001) and lactobacillus sp. (p = 0.001) compared to the non-discoloured plaque samples of the control group. comparing the children with  bs and non-discoloured plaque, higher counts for a. naeslundii (p = 0.013) were observed in caries-free children with bs while in caries-affected children with bs, lower counts of f. nucleatum (p = 0.007) were found. counts of lactobacillus  sp. were higher in non-discoloured plaque samples than in bs of caries-free and caries-affected children. conclusion: results suggest that the different microbial composition of bs might be associated with the lower caries experience  in affected subjects. the role of black-pigmented bacteria associated with periodontitis needs further studies.

TI  == fusobacterium nucleatum activates the immune response through retinoic acid-inducible gene i.
AB  == retinoic acid-inducible gene i (rig-i) is a cytosolic pattern recognition receptor involved in the sensing of rna viruses and the initiation of antiviral responses. fusobacterium nucleatum, a gram-negative anaerobic bacterium associated with periodontal disease, is capable of invading cells. we hypothesized that f. nucleatum's ability to invade cells allows the microorganism to activate the immune response through rig-i. bacterial invasion was found to be necessary for f. nucleatum-induced nuclear factor kappa b (nf-kappab) activation. following invasion of the human periodontal ligament fibroblast (pdlf), f. nucleatum was located in the cytosol. f. nucleatum infection led to an 80-fold increase in rig-i expression. silencing rig-i in pdlf by sirna led to a significant decrease of nf-kappab activation and expression of proinflammatory genes. additionally, f. nucleatum was able to secrete nucleic acids, and introduction of f. nucleatum rna into pdlf led to a rig-i-dependent activation of nf-kappab. our findings showed rig-i to be involved in the recognition of f. nucleatum. the function of rig-i is likely to be broad and not limited to sensing of viruses only. hence, this receptor may play an important role in detecting invasive forms of oral pathogens and contribute to inflammation in periodontal tissues.

TI  == association of plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin d concentrations and pathogenic oral bacteria in postmenopausal females.
AB  == background: previous findings of an association between 25-hydroxyvitamin d [25(oh)d] concentrations and periodontal disease may be partially explained by the antimicrobial properties of vitamin d. to the best of the authors' knowledge, no study has investigated the association between 25(oh)d and pathogenic oral bacteria, a putative cause of periodontal disease. methods: the association between plasma 25(oh)d concentrations and pathogenic oral bacteria was examined among postmenopausal females in the buffalo osteoporosis and periodontal disease  study (1997 to 2000), an ancillary study of the women's health initiative observational study. subgingival plaque samples were assessed using immunofluorescence for the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, and campylobacter rectus. logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ors) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) for prevalent bacteria by quintile (q) of 25(oh)d concentrations, adjusting for age and body mass index. results: of the 855 participants, 288 (34%) had deficient/inadequate (<50 nmol/l) 25(oh)d concentrations, and 496 (58%) had at least one species of pathogenic bacteria. no significant association was found between 25(oh)d and presence of any of these bacteria (adjusted or for high [q5] compared to low [q1] 25(oh)d = 0.96; 95% ci:  0.61 to 1.50; p for trend = 0.50). inverse, although not statistically significant, associations were found between 25(oh)d and more than one species of pathogenic bacteria (adjusted or for adequate compared to deficient/inadequate 25(oh)d = 0.85; 95% ci: 0.60 to 1.19). conclusions: no association was observed between pathogenic oral bacteria and 25(oh)d concentrations in postmenopausal females. this may be attributable to the species of bacteria assessed, small effect size, or a true absence of an association.

TI  == anaerobic co-culture of mesenchymal stem cells and anaerobic pathogens - a new in vitro model system.
AB  == background: human mesenchymal stem cells (hmscs) are multipotent by nature and are originally isolated from bone marrow. in light of a future application of hmscs in the oral cavity, a body compartment with varying oxygen partial pressures and an omnipresence of different bacterial species i.e. periodontitis pathogens, we performed this study to gain information about the behavior of hmsc in an anaerobic system and the response in interaction with oral bacterial pathogens. methodology/principal findings: we established a model system with oral pathogenic bacterial species and eukaryotic cells cultured in anaerobic conditions. the facultative anaerobe bacteria fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were studied.  their effects on hmscs and primary as well as permanent gingival epithelial cells (ca9-22, hgpec) were comparatively analyzed. we show that hmscs cope with anoxic  conditions, since 40% vital cells remain after 72 h of anaerobic culture. the ca9-22 and hgpec cells are significantly more sensitive to lack of oxygen. all bacterial species reveal a comparatively low adherence to and internalization into hmscs (0.2% and 0.01% of the initial inoculum, respectively). in comparison, the ca9-22 and hgpec cells present better targets for bacterial adherence and internalization. the production of the pro-inflammatory chemokine il-8 is higher  in both gingival epithelial cell lines compared to hmscs and fusobacterium nucleatum induce a time-dependent cytokine secretion in both cell lines. porphyromonas gingivalis is less effective in stimulating secretion of il-8 in the co-cultivation experiments. conclusions/significance: hmscs are suitable for  use in anoxic regions of the oral cavity. the interaction with local pathogenic bacteria does not result in massive pro-inflammatory cytokine responses. the test system established in this study allowed further investigation of parameters prior to set up of oral hmsc in vivo studies.

TI  == clinical and microbiological effects of lactobacillus reuteri probiotics in the treatment of chronic periodontitis: a randomized placebo-controlled study.
AB  == aim: the aim of this randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial was to evaluate the effects of lactobacillus reuteri-containing probiotic lozenges as an adjunct  to scaling and root planing (srp). material and methods: thirty chronic periodontitis patients were recruited and monitored clinically and microbiologically at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks after therapy. all patients received one-stage full-mouth disinfection and randomly assigned over a test (srp + probiotic, n = 15) or control (srp + placebo, n = 15) group. the lozenges were  used two times a day for 12 weeks. results: at week 12, all clinical parameters were significantly reduced in both groups, while there was significantly more pocket depth reduction (p < 0.05) and attachment gain (p < 0.05) in moderate and  deep pockets; more porphyromonas gingivalis reduction was observed in the srp + probiotic group. conclusions: the results indicate that oral administration of l. reuteri lozenges could be a useful adjunct to srp in chronic periodontitis.

TI  == cetylpyridinium chloride suppresses gene expression associated with halitosis.
AB  == objective: halitosis is a common complaint affecting the majority of the population. mouthrinses containing cetylpyridinium chloride (cpc) have been used  as oral hygiene aids to suppress oral malodor. although the clinical efficacy of  these mouthrinses has been well-documented, the mechanism whereby cpc reduces malodor is less-well-understood. we hypothesized that cpc suppresses expression of the genes (mgl and cdl) and enzymes responsible for methyl mercaptan (ch3sh) and hydrogen sulfide (h2s) production by oral anaerobes associated with halitosis. in this study, the mgl and cdl expression of porphyromonas gingivalis  and fusobacterium nucleatum in the presence of cpc was investigated. materials and methods: we used a microdilution method to determine the growth and production of volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) by p. gingivalis w83 and f. nucleatum atcc 10953 in respective media containing cpc (0.5 mug/ml to 1.5 mug/ml). for metabolic activity, we used an xtt {2,3-bis(2-methyloxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2h-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide} reduction assay. we used real-time rt-pcr and western blotting to evaluate the effect of cpc at sub-mic levels on mgl and cdl expression at the transcriptional  and enzymatic levels. results: cpc inhibited the growth of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum at mics of 3 mug/ml and 2 mug/ml, and at mbcs of 6 mug/ml and 3 mug/ml, respectively. compared with untreated controls, cpc at 1.5 mug/ml suppressed ch3sh production of p. gingivalis by 69.84%+/-2.88% and h2s production of f. nucleatum by 82.55%+/-8.36% (p<0.05) without affecting metabolic activity. inhibition of mgl mrna (81.58%+/-20.33%) and protein (39.15%+/-6.65%) expression  in p. gingivalis and inhibition of cdl mrna (61.76%+/-13.75%) and protein (64.34%+/-1.62%) expression in f. nucleatum were also noted (p<0.05). conclusion: cpc represents an effective agent for halitosis reduction by inhibiting the growth and suppressing the expression of specific genes related to vsc production in anaerobic periodontal pathogens.

TI  == dna-based adaptive immunity protect host from infection-associated periodontal bone resorption via recognition of porphyromonas gingivalis virulence component.
AB  == background: porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) is one of a constellation of oral organisms associated with human chronic periodontitis. while adaptive immunity to periodontal pathogen proteins has been investigated and is an important component of periodontal bone resorption, the effect of periodontal pathogen dna in eliciting systemic and mucosal antibody and modulating immune responses has not been investigated. methods: rowett rats were locally injected with whole genomic  pg dna in alum. escherichia coli (ec) genomic dna, fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) genomic dna, and saline/alum injected rats served as controls. after various time points, serum igg and salivary iga antibody to ec, fn or pg were detected by elisa. serum and salivary antibody reactions with pg surface antigens were determined by western blot analyses and the specific antigen was identified by mass spectrometry. effects of genomic dna immunization on pg bacterial colonization and experimental periodontal bone resorption were also evaluated. results: sera from pg dna, ec dna and fn dna-injected rats did not react with ec  or fn bacteria. serum igg antibody levels to pg and pg surface extracts were significantly higher in animals immunized with pg dna as compared to the control  groups. rats injected with pg dna demonstrated a strong serum igg and salivary iga antibody reaction solely to pg fimbrillin (41kda), the major protein component of pg fimbriae. in the pg dna-immunized group, the numbers of pg bacteria in oral cavity and the extent of periodontal bone resorption were significantly reduced after pg infection. conclusions: this study suggests that infected hosts may select specific genes from whole genomic dna of the periodontal pathogen for transcription and presentation. the results indicate that the unique gene selected can initiate a host protective immune response to the parent bacterium.

AB  == aim: to assess the efficacy of a 0.07% cetylpyridinium chloride (cpc) mouth rinse in the control of plaque and gingival inflammation during a 6-month period. material and methods: adult subjects with moderate gingivitis were selected [>/=40% bleeding on marginal probing (bomp)]. after retrieving microbiological samples and evaluating the clinical parameters (plaque, bomp and stain indexes),  a professional prophylaxis was performed and subjects were randomly assigned to the test (cpc mouth rinse) or to the placebo group. subjects were re-assessed after 3 and 6 months. results: a total of 67 patients (35 test, 32 placebo) were  included in the analysis. at 6 months, intra-group significant plaque reductions  were observed in the test group (0.691, p < 0.001), but not in the placebo (0.181, p = 0.653). at 6 months, the mean bomp values were lower in the test group (p = 0.052). changes between baseline and 6 months were significantly higher in the test group both for plaque (p = 0.002) and bomp (p = 0.037) when compared with the placebo. a microbiological impact was observed in the test group, especially for prevotella intermedia. conclusion: the evaluated 0.07% cpc-based mouth rinse, used three times per day adjunctively to mechanical tooth  cleaning, prevents plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation, as compared to  the placebo, for at least 6 months.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis promotes invasion of oral squamous cell carcinoma through induction of prommp9 and its activation.
AB  == recent epidemiological studies have revealed a significant association between periodontitis and oral squamous cell carcinoma (oscc). furthermore, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (mmp9) is implicated in the invasion and metastasis of tumour cells. we examined the involvement of porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontal pathogen, in oscc invasion through induced expression of prommp and its activation. prommp9 was continuously secreted from carcinoma sas cells, while p.  gingivalis infection increased proenzyme expression and subsequently processed it to active mmp9 in culture supernatant, which enhanced cellular invasion. in contrast, fusobacterium nucleatum, another periodontal organism, failed to demonstrate such activities. the effects of p. gingivalis were observed with highly invasive cells, but not with the low invasivetype. p. gingivalis also stimulated proteinase-activated receptor 2 (par2) and enhanced prommp9 expression, which promoted cellular invasion. p. gingivalis mutants deficient in  gingipain proteases failed to activate mmp9. infected sas cells exhibited activation of erk1/2, p38, and nf-kb, and their inhibitors diminished both prommp9-overexpression and cellular invasion. together, our results show that p.  gingivalis activates the erk1/2-ets1, p38/hsp27, and par2/nf-kb pathways to induce prommp9 expression, after which the proenzyme is activated by gingipains to promote cellular invasion of oscc cell lines. these findings suggest a novel mechanism of progression and metastasis of oscc associated with periodontitis.

TI  == relationship between halitosis and periodontal disease - associated oral bacteria in tongue coatings.
AB  == aim: the objective of our study was to investigate the relationship between halitosis and oral bacteria in tongue coating (tc) and saliva samples from patients with halitosis, and to evaluate the effect of tongue cleaning on halitosis. methods: ninety-four participants complaining of oral malodour were included in the study. organoleptic (or) values, volatile sulphur compound (vsc)  concentrations determined by gas chromatography and tc scores were used as clinical parameters of halitosis. quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions were used to determine the numbers of periodontal disease-associated oral bacteria. results: there was a significant correlation between tc scores and or values, methylmercaptan (ch3 sh) concentrations and vsc concentrations (spearman's rank-correlation coefficient test, p < 0.01). there was also a positive correlation between the clinical parameters of halitosis and total bacterial numbers and prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and campylobacter rectus concentrations in the tc samples. however, there was no similar correlation with respect to the saliva samples. the participants were sub-divided into two groups based on whether they had the habit of tongue cleaning or not. the participants with the habit of tongue cleaning had significantly lower or scores, vsc concentrations and p. intermedia, f. nucleatum and c. rectus levels than the other participants (mann-whitney u-test, p < 0.05). conclusion: these results suggested that periodontal disease-associated oral bacteria in tcs are closely related to halitosis and that tongue cleaning may be  an effective method for improving halitosis.

TI  == oral microbial colonization in laryngectomized patients as a possible cofactor of biofilm formation on their voice prostheses.
AB  == aim: biofilm formation on voice prostheses, which are used for voice rehabilitation in laryngectomized patients, is a main cause of device failure. the aim of this study was to assess whether the presence of periodontal pathogens in the biofilm on voice prostheses is related to that in the oral cavity and associated with the periodontal status of the patients. methods: thirty-one laryngectomized patients were invited to participate, 13 of whom met exclusion criteria. the remaining 18 were classified according to the community periodontal index of treatment needs (community periodontal index of treatment needs (cpitn), grades 0-4). biofilm samples from the oral cavity and voice prostheses were analysed by pcr-based hybridization for 11 pathogens. results: all dentate patients required periodontal treatment (cpitn-3: n = 4, cpitn-4: n = 8); the remaining six were edentulous. the diversity (i.e. number of bacterial species detected) of pathogens detected on the voice prostheses correlated significantly  positively with the diversity of pathogens in the oral cavity and with clinical parameters. furthermore, the diversity of pathogens differed significantly between dentate and edentulous patients. conclusions: results emphasize the oral  cavity as an important source of bacteria for biofilm formation on voice prostheses. whether these pathogens reduce the lifetime of the device by increased biofilm formation and/or increase the risk of silicone deterioration requires further study.

TI  == characterization and application of a flow system for in vitro multispecies oral  biofilm formation.
AB  == background and objective: bacteria in the oral cavity grow in the form of biofilms; these structures are subject to constant saliva or gingival crevicular  fluid flow conditions. the aims of this study were: (i) to develop and to characterize an in-vitro biofilm model with oral bacteria growing under flow and  shear conditions; and (ii) to demonstrate the usefulness of the model for evaluating the activity of three antiplaque agents. material and methods: we used a bioreactor to grow the oral bacteria streptococcus oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis under planktonic conditions. biofilms were established using a modified robbins device on hydroxyapatite (hap) discs. three- to 7-d-old biofilms were analysed using culture methods, scanning electron microscopy, live/dead staining and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (confocal laser scanning microscopy). finally, we assessed the antimicrobial activity of three mouthrinses [0.12% chlorhexidine (chx), 0.12% chlorhexidine and sodium fluoride (chx+naf) and 0.12% chlorhexidine and 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride (chx+cpc)] using a planktonic test (short interval-killing test) and in  our 4-d biofilm model. results: the viable cell counts showed that each species was consistently found in the biofilms throughout the study. the architecture and cell distribution were similar to those described for biofilms in situ, with the  exception of a thin layer of living cells that was found close to the hap. the effectiveness test of the mouthwashes demonstrated that cells in biofilms showed  more tolerance compared with planktonic cells. moreover, it was observed that in  4-d biofilm formed in vitro, chx+cpc caused significantly higher mortality compared with chx (p = 0.003) and chx+naf (p < 0.001). conclusion: our results suggest that we have a highly reproducible system for multispecies oral biofilm formation and that it is a useful tool for assessing antibacterial molecules before their clinical evaluation. it also has great potential to be used in basic research on supragingival and subgingival biofilms.

TI  == evaluation of the host response in various models of induced periodontal disease  in mice.
AB  == background: the aim of this study is to characterize and evaluate the host response caused by three different models of experimental periodontitis in mice.  methods: c57bl/6 wild-type female mice were distributed into six experimental groups and sacrificed at 7, 15, and 30 days after the induction of periodontal disease: 1) group c: no treatment control group; 2) group l: periodontal disease  induced by ligature; 3) group g-pg: oral gavage with porphyromonas gingivalis (pg); 4) group g-pgfn: oral gavage with fusobacterium nucleatum + pg; 5) group i-pg: heat-killed pg injected into the palatal mucosa between the molars; and 6)  group i-v: phosphate-buffered saline injected into the palatal mucosa. the samples were used to analyze the immune-inflammatory process in the gingival tissue via descriptive histologic and real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses. the alveolar bone loss was evaluated using microcomputed tomography. the data were analyzed using the kruskal-wallis test, followed by a post hoc dunn test and analysis of variance, followed by a tukey test using a 5% significance level. results: only the ligature model displayed significant alveolar bone loss  in the initial period (7 days), which was maintained with time. the group injected with heat-killed pg displayed significant alveolar bone loss starting from day 15, which continued to progress with time (p <0.05). a significant increase (p <0.05) in the gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 and -1beta) and proteins involved in osteoclastogenesis (receptor  activator of nuclear factor-kappab ligand and osteoprotegerin) was observed in the ligature group on day 7. conclusion: the ligature and injection of heat-killed pg models were the most representative of periodontal disease in humans, whereas the oral gavage models were not effective at inducing the disease under the experimental conditions.

TI  == serum antibody responses to periodontal microbiota in chronic and aggressive periodontitis: a postulate revisited.
AB  == background: the authors revisited the 1999 international workshop postulate of robust serum antibody responses to infecting agents in localized aggressive periodontitis (lagp) and weak responses in generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp). antibody responses were further examined in localized and generalized chronic periodontitis (lcp and gcp). methods: the study includes 119 patients (60 males and 59 females, aged 11 to 76 years), 18 with lagp, 37 with gagp, 37 with lcp, and 27 with gcp. multiple subgingival plaque samples/patient (1,057 in total) were analyzed with respect to 11 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridizations, and serum immunoglobulin (ig)g levels were measured against the same bacteria using checkerboard immunoblotting. further, infection ratios (antibody level over the average bacterial colonization by the homologous  species) were computed for each patient. comparisons of bacterial colonization, serum igg levels, and infection ratios were made across the diagnostic categories using multivariable linear regression models adjusting for age and race/ethnicity. results: there were no statistically significant differences in serum igg levels to aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans among the four diagnostic categories. igg levels to several species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and campylobacter rectus, were highest in patients with gagp and significantly different from lcp and gcp, but not from lagp. comparisons based on infection ratios showed no statistically significant differences for any species between gagp and lagp. conclusion: this study provides evidence against the 1999 workshop's postulate of weak serum antibody responses in patients with gagp and shows that serum igg responses in gagp are comparable to those in lagp, but higher than in gcp or lcp for several species.

TI  == periodontitis in pregnant baboons: systemic inflammation and adaptive immune responses and pregnancy outcomes in a baboon model.
AB  == background/objectives: chronic periodontal infections have been suggested to contribute to the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. material and methods: this  study describes the relationship of patterns of systemic inflammatory mediators and igg antibody to 20 oral bacteria in pregnant female baboons (papio anubis) coupled with clinical features of ligature-induced periodontitis, as risk indicators for adverse pregnancy outcomes. animals showing a preterm delivery and/or low birth weight newborns, as well as those pregnancies resulting in spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or fetal demise were tabulated as adverse pregnancy outcomes. results: a significantly greater frequency of the periodontitis group neonates had a low birth weight (18.1%; p = 0.008) and decreased gestational age (9.8%). spontaneous abortion/stillbirth/fetal demise were increased in the periodontitis (8.7%) versus the control group (3.8%) (p = 0.054). the baseline oral clinical presentation of the experimental animals did not relate to the adverse pregnancy outcomes. animals with the greatest extent/severity of periodontitis progression during the initial (1/2) of gestation (ie. to mid-pregnancy) had the greatest risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes. baseline biological parameters indicating historical responses of the animals to periodontal challenge demonstrated individual variation in selected mediators, some of which became more differential during ligature-induced periodontitis. the relationship of clinical parameters to systemic inflammatory responses was consistent with a temporal contribution to adverse pregnancy outcomes in a subset of the animals. conclusions: these results support a link between periodontitis and adverse pregnancy outcomes in the baboons and provide a prospective experimental model for delineating the biologic parameters that contribute to a causal relationship between chronic oral infections and birth events.

TI  == subgingival root brushing in deep human periodontal pockets.
AB  == objective: the short-term clinical and microbiological effects of patient-applied subgingival root brushing were assessed on untreated deep human periodontal pockets. methods: assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, total cultivable subgingival counts, and cultivable counts and proportions of six putative periodontal pathogens were carried out at baseline and after 14 days on  two contralateral > or = 6 mm bleeding interproximal posterior sites in each of 11 adults with untreated chronic periodontitis. one of the sites was randomly assigned to daily patient-applied subgingival root brushing for 14 days, and the  other to remain with the patient's pre-existing tooth brushing and flossing regimen. no other periodontal therapy was performed during the 14 test days. results: significant reductions in plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, total subgingival counts, and levels of putative periodontal pathogens were found after 14 days of subgingival root brushing. subgingival root brushing nearly eliminated bleeding on probing at test sites, reduced probing depths by a mean of 1.8 mm, and reduced cultivable subgingival proportions of six evaluated putative  periodontal pathogens from a cumulative total of 14.1% to 0.8%. in comparison, no significant clinical or microbiological changes were detected after 14 days where the patient's pre-existing oral hygiene regimen remained unaltered. conclusions:  subgingival root brushing over 14 days, in properly trained patients, induced favorable clinical and microbiological changes in deep periodontal pockets > or = 6 mm even in the absence of professional subgingival debridement.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in human chronic periodontitis microbiota.
AB  == background: patients with chronic periodontitis (cp) may yield multiple species of putative periodontal bacterial pathogens that vary in their antibiotic drug susceptibility. this study determines the occurrence of in vitro antibiotic resistance among selected subgingival periodontal pathogens in patients with cp.  methods: subgingival biofilm specimens from inflamed deep periodontal pockets were removed before treatment from 400 adults with cp in the united states. the samples were cultured, and selected periodontal pathogens were tested in vitro for susceptibility to amoxicillin at 8 mg/l, clindamycin at 4 mg/l, doxycycline at 4 mg/l, and metronidazole at 16 mg/l, with a post hoc combination of data for  amoxicillin and metronidazole. gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads were subjected to ciprofloxacin disk-diffusion testing. results: overall, 74.2% of the patients with cp revealed subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to at least one of the test antibiotics. one or more test species, most often prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, streptococcus constellatus, or aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, were resistant in vitro to doxycycline, amoxicillin, metronidazole, or clindamycin, in 55%, 43.3%, 30.3%, and 26.5% of the patients with cp, respectively. fifteen percent of patients harbored subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to both amoxicillin and metronidazole, which were mostly either s. constellatus (45 individuals) or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains of gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads (nine individuals). conclusions: patients with cp in the united states frequently yielded subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant in vitro to therapeutic concentrations of antibiotics commonly used in clinical periodontal practice. the wide variability  found in periodontal pathogen antibiotic-resistance patterns should concern clinicians empirically selecting antibiotic treatment regimens for patients with  cp.

TI  == no evidence of triclosan-resistant bacteria following long-term use of triclosan-containing toothpaste.
AB  == background and objective: there is a paucity of data in relation to the possible  emergence of triclosan (tcs)-resistant bacteria following long-term exposure to tcs toothpaste. therefore, this study investigated whether long-term continuous exposure to tcs in toothpaste selects for tcs-resistant bacteria within the oral  biofilm. material and methods: dental plaque samples were collected from 40 individuals during year 5 of a randomised controlled trial. participants had been randomly assigned to use tcs (3000 mug/ml tcs) (n = 18) or placebo toothpaste (n  = 22). diluted plaque samples were plated on to wilkins-chalgren agar plates containing 5% (v/v) laked sheep red blood cells and tcs (concentrations ranging from 25 to 150 mug/ml) and incubated at 37 degrees c under microaerophilic and anaerobic conditions for 2-10 d. selected bacterial isolates were identified by partial 16s rdna sequencing and tcs minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) determined for each isolate. results: at 3000 mug/ml tcs no growth was observed under microaerophilic or anaerobic conditions in either group. the mics of tcs for all isolates ranged from 125 to 1000 mug/ml in both groups. species common to both groups had similar mics. veillonella parvula and campylobacter gracilis were the most frequent isolates from both groups, with similar mics in both groups. conclusion: the use of tcs-containing toothpaste did not appear to lead to an increase in mic of tcs of oral bacterial isolates.

TI  == oxygen deprivation affects the antimicrobial action of ll-37 as determined by microplate real-time kinetic measurements under anaerobic conditions.
AB  == some agents, including escherichia coli and group a streptococcus pyogenes cause  infections in oxygen depleted sites. ll-37 is a human host defence peptide shown  previously to play an important role in controlling infections caused by these bacteria. however, the effect of oxygen levels on the antimicrobial activity of ll-37 remains obscure. in order to test the effect of oxygen (or lack thereof) on ll-37's activity against e. coli and s. pyogenes, a method for adapting commonly  used microtiter plates for real-time growth-kinetic (and growth-inhibition) measurements under anaerobic conditions was developed. using the proposed method, anaerobic conditions were attained in the microplate within 30 min and were maintained for at least five days. anaerobiosis was further confirmed by comparing the growth of two anaerobic oral species (porphyromonas gingivalis and  fusobacterium nucleatum) in anaerobic compartments of microtiter plates versus aerobic ones. both species grew only in the anaerobic compartments of the plates  as indicated by the growth curves generated. the sensitivities of e. coli and s.  pyogenes to ll-37 were tested under anaerobic conditions and compared to those in aerobic ones. the oxygen facultative e. coli grew to a higher density under aerobic conditions and its sensitivity to ll-37 was increased under anaerobiosis. the microaerophilic pathogen s. pyogenes grew faster and to a higher density under anaerobic conditions and was much more resistant to ll-37 under oxygen deprivation. our results suggest that resistance to antimicrobial agents of microbes infecting anaerobic-microaerophilic sites should be tested under oxygen-restricted conditions.

TI  == validation of antibiotic efficacy on in vitro subgingival biofilms.
AB  == background: systemic antibiotics are often used as adjunctive treatment modalities for periodontal diseases. testing of antimicrobial efficacy can be relevant only if the bacteria are in the form of biofilms rather than the planktonic state, and at concentrations of physiologic relevance, i.e., reachable in the periodontal pocket. the aim of the present study is to test the antimicrobial efficacy of five common antibiotic schemes at physiologically relevant concentrations on a multispecies in vitro biofilm model. methods: a 10-species in vitro subgingival biofilm model was exposed to metronidazole (15 mug/ml), amoxicillin (15 mug/ml), metronidazole and amoxicillin in combination, doxycycline (2 mug/ml), and azithromycin (10 mug/ml) over 24 hours. species-specific bacterial numbers were determined by culture on selective agar media or by epifluorescence microscopy. results: metronidazole alone did not affect biofilm composition. total bacterial counts were significantly reduced by  doxycycline, azithromycin, and amoxicillin alone or in combination with metronidazole, albeit by less than 1 log. on the species-specific level, these regimens significantly reduced the numbers of streptococcus anginosus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum, as well as campylobacter rectus (except for amoxicillin alone). the strongest effects were displayed by the combination of amoxicillin and metronidazole. conclusion: antibiotics at concentrations detectable in gingival crevicular fluid do not dramatically reduce total bacterial loads in this in vitro biofilm model, but cause species-specific  reductions, which may disrupt the biofilm unity.

TI  == the microbiology of the peri-implant sulcus following successful implantation of  oral prosthetic treatments.
AB  == background: oral implants are widely used in partially and fully edentulous patients; however, the integration of an implant can be endangered by factors such as intraoral bacteria or inflammatory reactions. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the microbial flora present in the sulcus around dental implants  and to assess the relationship between gingival health and microbial flora present. materials and methods: twenty patients who had received oral implants with no complications were followed for a period of 9 months. assessment of probing depth, the presence of bleeding on probing and microbial sampling from the peri-implant sulcus were performed at three different time points- 4 weeks after surgery, 1 month and 6 months after loading. the samples were taken by paper points and transferred to the microbiology lab in thioglyocolate cultures.  in order to do a colony count and isolate the aerobic capnophilic and anerobic bacteria the samples were cultured and incubated on laboratory media. the colonies were also identified using various diagnostic tests. alterations in the  presence of various bacterial species over time and gum health were tested using  analysis of variance (anova) with tukey's test post hoc. results: the average pocket depth for each patient ranged from 1.37 +/- 0.39 mm to 2.55 +/- 0.72 mm. the bacteria isolated from the cultured samples included aerobic, facultative anerobic, obligate anerobic and capnophilic bacteria. conclusion: the anerobic conditions created in the peri-implant sulcus might with time enhance the number  of anerobic bacteria present following dental implant loading.

TI  == the protective effect of recombinant foma-expressing lactobacillus acidophilus against periodontal infection.
AB  == a number of studies have shown that the outer membrane protein foma found in fusobacterium nucleatum demonstrates great potential as an immune target for combating periodontitis. lactobacillus acidophilus is a useful antigen delivery vehicle for mucosal immunisation, and previous studies by our group have shown that l. acidophilus acts as a protective factor in periodontal health. in this study, making use of the immunogenicity of foma and the probiotic properties of l. acidophilus, we constructed a recombinant form of l. acidophilus expressing the foma protein and detected the foma-specific igg in the serum and siga in the  saliva of mice through oral administration with the recombinant strains. when serum containing foma-specific antibodies was incubated with the f. nucleatum in  vitro, the number of porphyromonas gingivalis cells that coaggregated with the f. nucleatum cells was significantly reduced. furthermore, a mouse gum abscess model was successfully generated, and the range of gingival abscesses in the immune mice was relatively limited compared with the control group. the level of il-1beta in the serum and local gum tissues of the immune mice was consistently lower than in the control group. our findings indicated that oral administration  of the recombinant l. acidophilus reduced the risk of periodontal infection with  p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum.

TI  == microcalorimetric determination of the effects of amoxicillin, metronidazole, and their combination on in vitro biofilm.
AB  == background: the mechanism of action of adjuvant antibiotic therapy in the treatment of peri-implantitis is not well understood. the aim of this study is to investigate antibiotic susceptibility of an in vitro biofilm by isothermal microcalorimetry (imc). methods: titanium disks containing a 72-hour three-species biofilm (streptococcus sanguinis dsm20068, fusobacterium nucleatum  atcc10953, and porphyromonas gingivalis dsm20709) were placed in a series of imc  ampoules with nutrient agar supplemented with increasing concentrations of amoxicillin, metronidazole, or their combination and incubated anaerobically for  10 days. lag time and maximum growth rate were determined from continuous heat-flow recordings of metabolic activity. to validate the imc biofilm results,  adherent s. sanguinis and p. gingivalis were incubated anaerobically in medium supplemented with antibiotics at 37 degrees c for 24 hours, and their vitality was determined by live/dead staining, conventional culturing, and imc. results: in all biofilm samples incubated with antibiotics, a prolonged lag phase was observed compared with controls (p <0.05). maximum growth rate was significantly  lower for samples treated with either amoxicillin or metronidazole compared with  controls (p <0.05). combining the antibiotics did not improve this effect. concentrations exceeding 10 times the minimum inhibitory concentration completely inhibited the growth of adherent s. sanguinis and p. gingivalis, whereas lower concentrations resulted in only a delay in the lag phase. a poor correlation was  observed between live/dead staining and conventional culturing. conclusions: imc  gives new evidence about antibiotic effects on oral biofilms and is more informative than conventional culture and live/dead assays. the combination of antibiotics was found to be more efficient than metronidazole alone; however, only minor differences in growth inhibition were detected compared with amoxicillin alone.

TI  == suppression of t-cell chemokines by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is a major pathogen in periodontal disease and is associated with immune dysbiosis. in this study, we found that p. gingivalis did  not induce the expression of the t-cell chemokine ip-10 (cxcl10) from neutrophils, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs), or gingival epithelial cells. furthermore, p. gingivalis suppressed gamma interferon (ifn-gamma)-stimulated release of ip-10, itac (cxcl11), and mig (cxcl9) from epithelial cells and inhibited ip-10 secretion in a mixed infection with the otherwise stimulatory fusobacterium nucleatum. inhibition of chemokine expression occurred at the level of gene transcription and was associated with downregulation of interferon regulatory factor 1 (irf-1) and decreased levels of  stat1. ectopic expression of irf-1 in epithelial cells relieved p. gingivalis-induced inhibition of ip-10 release. direct contact between p. gingivalis and epithelial cells was not required for ip-10 inhibition. these results highlight the immune-disruptive potential of p. gingivalis. suppression of ip-10 and other th1-biasing chemokines by p. gingivalis may perturb the balance of protective and destructive immunity in the periodontal tissues and facilitate the pathogenicity of oral microbial communities.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of ethanol extracts of laminaria japonica against oral microorganisms.
AB  == laminaria japonica is a brown alga, which is consumed widely in korea, japan, and china. this study investigated the antimicrobial activity of ethanol extracts of  l. japonica against oral microbial species to assess the possible application of  l. japonica extracts in dental care products. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) were determined  in culture medium using a microdilution method. the mics of ethanol extracts of l. japonica with oral streptococci were 62.5-500 mug/ml and the mbcs were 125-1000 mug/ml. the mics of actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces odontolyticus were 250 and 62.5 mug/ml, respectively. the mbcs of a. naeslundii and a. odontolyticus were 500 and 250 mug/ml, respectively. the mics were 250 and 62.5 mug/ml for fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis, respectively. the killing of streptococcus mutans and p. gingivalis was dependent on the incubation time. the killing of s. mutans, a. odontolyticus, and p. gingivalis was significantly dependent on the extract concentration. bacterial treatment with l. japonica extracts changed the cell surface texture of s. mutans, a. odontolyticus, and p. gingivalis. the results of this study suggest that l. japonica extracts may be useful for the development of antimicrobial agents to combat oral pathogens.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr combined with propidium monoazide for the selective quantification of viable periodontal pathogens in an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  == background and objectives: differentiation of live and dead cells is an important challenge when using molecular diagnosis for microbial identification. this is particularly relevant when bacteria have been exposed to antimicrobial agents. the objective of this study was to test a method using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) combined with propidium monoazide (pma), developed for the selective quantification of viable p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and total bacteria in an in vitro biofilm model after antimicrobial treatment. material and methods: pma-qpcr method was tested in an in vitro biofilm model, using isopropyl alcohol as the antimicrobial agent. matured biofilms were exposed for 1, 5, 10 and 30 min to isopropyl alcohol by immersion. biofilms were disrupted and pma added (final concentration of 100 mum). after dna isolation, qpcr was carried out using specific primers and probes for the target bacteria. the differentiation of live and dead cells was tested by analysis of variance. results: when pma was used in the presence of viable target bacterial cells, no statistically significant inhibition of qpcr amplification was detected (p > 0.05 in all cases). conversely, after immersion in isopropyl alcohol of the biofilm, pma resulted in a significant total reduction of qpcr amplification of about 4 log10 . p. gingivalis showed a vitality reduction in the biofilm of 3 log10 , while a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum showed a 2 log10 reduction. conclusion: these results demonstrate the efficiency of pma for  differentiating viable and dead p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum cells, as well as total bacteria, in an in vitro biofilm model, after being exposed to an antimicrobial agent. hence, this pma-qpcr method may be useful for studying the effect of antimicrobial agents aimed at oral biofilms.

TI  == subgingival bacterial burden in relation to clinical and radiographic periodontal parameters.
AB  == background: this cross-sectional study characterizes the association between subgingival bacterial profile and periodontal parameters in patients assigned to  coronary angiography because of cardiologic problems, which may affect the oral microbiota. methods: pooled subgingival bacterial samples were collected from 477 dentate individuals during the oral examinations, along with periodontal probing  depth (pd) and assessments of bleeding on probing (bop) and radiographic alveolar bone loss (abl). the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assay was used to determine the levels of 29 oral bacteria, which were divided into three bacterial complexes. results: all bacterial combinations from the etiologic bacterial group and each species from the red complex were significantly associated (p <0.001) with grade of abl. the prevalence of the etiologic bacterial group and the level  of each species were also associated strongly with the proportion of sites with pd 4 to 5 mm and >/= 6 mm, bop, and abl, except aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. levels of gram-negative oral bacteria correlated significantly with those of gram-positive species (r = 0.840, p <0.001). in multiple logistic regression analysis, the prevalence of the etiologic bacterial  group, levels of gram-negative bacteria and treponema denticola, and the prevalence of porphyromonas gingivalis and t. denticola associated significantly  with abl, whereas other bacterial complexes and levels of gram-positive species did not. conclusions: although levels of gram-negative and -positive species paralleled periodontal parameters, only the species considered etiologic were associated with abl.

TI  == clinical outcome of a nonsurgical and surgical treatment protocol in different types of peri-implantitis: a case series.
AB  == objective: the replacement of missing teeth with dental implants has been standard practice in dentistry for many years. the success of dental implants depends on many factors, among which the diagnosis, clinical severity, and treatment of peri-implant diseases play a key role. in this prospective case series, the influence of cumulative treatment modalities on peri-implantitis with and without pus formation on clinical outcome was assessed. method and materials: during 2010, 28 patients were referred for peri-implantitis treatment. they presented two different types of peri-implant diseases: peri-implantitis with (17 implants) or without pus formation (33 implants). after microbiologic diagnosis,  all patients were treated at baseline with full-mouth scaling and root planing. two months later, further full-mouth scaling and root planing and additional antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) was applied. four months after baseline, patients with pus formation additionally underwent access flap surgery. active human matrix metalloproteinase-8 (ammp-8) levels were measured in eluates  before and after all treatment modalities and 7 months after baseline. results: clinical parameters (probing depth, bleeding on probing) and ammp-8-levels improved in both groups after treatment and the final examination. in periimplantitis patients without pus formation, all parameters decreased after full-mouth scaling and root planing and the additional apdt and no surgery was necessary to improve the parameters. in patients with pus formation, the parameters decreased only after access flap surgery. conclusion: the presence of  pus influences the clinical outcome of the treatment of peri-implant diseases. whereas peri-implantitis cases without pus formation can be successfully managed  nonsurgically, peri-implantitis with pus formation can be effectively treated after an additional observation time of 3 months postoperatively only with additional flap surgery.

TI  == a molecular survey of a captive wallaby population for periodontopathogens and the co-incidence of fusobacterium necrophorum subspecies necrophorum with periodontal diseases.
AB  == periodontal diseases (pd) are diseases of polymicrobial aetiology and constitute  major health problems in captive macropods. increasing knowledge of the causal pathogens is therefore crucial for effective management and prevention of these diseases. pcr survey and sequence analyses of potential periodontopathogens in captive wallaby populations revealed a co-incidence of the diseases with the detection of fusobacterium necrophorum subsp. necrophorum (fnn) and its encoded leukotoxin (lkta) gene. sequence analyses showed that the outer membrane protein  of fnn in the genbank database shared significant homology (99%) with the fnn encoded haemagglutinin-related-protein gene fragment identified in this study. in addition, this report suggests the existence of a variant of fnn with no detectable lkta gene and thus warrants further studies. in contrast to reports associating porphyromonas gingivalis and f. nucleatum with pd, this study revealed that pd in macropods are associated with porphyromonas gulae and fnn and raises the question: is there a possible host pathogen co-evolution in the pathogenesis of pd in animals and humans? these findings contribute to the understanding of the aetiology of periodontal disease in macropods as well as opening up a new direction of research into the microbial interactions involved in the pathogenesis of pd in macropods.

TI  == the surface layer of tannerella forsythia contributes to serum resistance and oral bacterial coaggregation.
AB  == tannerella forsythia is an anaerobic, gram-negative bacterium involved in the so-called "red complex," which is associated with severe and chronic periodontitis. the surface layer (s-layer) of t. forsythia is composed of cell surface glycoproteins, such as tfsa and tfsb, and is known to play a role in adhesion/invasion and suppression of proinflammatory cytokine expression. here we investigated the association of this s-layer with serum resistance and coaggregation with other oral bacteria. the growth of the s-layer-deficient mutant in a bacterial medium containing more than 20% non-heat-inactivated calf serum (cs) or more than 40% non-heat-inactivated human serum was significantly suppressed relative to that of the wild type (wt). next, we used confocal microscopy to perform quantitative analysis on the effect of serum. the survival  ratio of the mutant exposed to 100% non-heat-inactivated cs (76% survival) was significantly lower than that of the wt (97% survival). furthermore, significant  c3b deposition was observed in the mutant but not in the wt. in a coaggregation assay, the mutant showed reduced coaggregation with streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, and porphyromonas gingivalis but strong coaggregation with fusobacterium nucleatum. these results indicated that the s-layer of t. forsythia plays multiple roles in virulence and may be associated with periodontitis.

TI  == characteristics of porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide in co-culture with fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is associated with chronic periodontitis and forms multi-species biofilms. they can communicate within species as well as with other species found in the subgingiva, which may induce changes in the growth ratio and virulence of periodontopathogens. the lipopolysaccharide (lps) of p. gingivalis shows different virulence by growth condition. the purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of p. gingivalis lps when co-cultured with fusobacterium nucleatum. after culture of p. gingivalis in the presence or absence of f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis lps was extracted. thp-1 cells were treated with the lps and induction of cytokine expression was investigated using  real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). for the analysis of p. gingivalis lps, lps biosynthesis-related genes such as lpxa and lpxd were evaluated with real-time rt-pcr. finally, molecular mass of lipid a was measured by mass spectrometry after hydrolysis of the lps. co-cultured p. gingivalis lps exhibited higher induction of expression of interleukin 1beta, 6, and 8 than single-cultured p. gingivalis lps. these symptoms may be caused by an increase in m/z 1689 lipid a through the upregulation of lpxa and lpxd expression by communication between p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum.

TI  == oral epithelial cell responses to multispecies microbial biofilms.
AB  == this report describes the use of a novel model of multispecies biofilms to stimulate profiles of cytokines/chemokines from oral epithelial cells that contribute to local inflammation in the periodontium. streptococcus gordonii (sg)/s. oralis (so)/s. sanguinis (ss) and sg/fusobacterium nucleatum (fn)/porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) biofilms elicited significantly elevated levels of il-1alpha and showed synergistic stimulatory activity compared with an  additive effect of the 3 individual bacteria. only the sg/actinomyces naeslundii  (an)/fn multispecies biofilms elicited il-6 levels above those of control. il-8 was a primary response to the sg/an/fn biofilms, albeit the level was not enhanced compared with a predicted composite level from the monospecies challenges. these results represent some of the first data documenting alterations in profiles of oral epithelial cell responses to multispecies biofilms.

TI  == validation of a quantitative real-time pcr assay and comparison with fluorescence microscopy and selective agar plate counting for species-specific quantification  of an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  == background and objective: subgingival biofilms are the prime etiological factor of periodontal disease. owing to their complex polymicrobial nature, quantification of individual bacterial species within the biofilm for research and diagnostic purposes can be methodologically challenging. the aims of this study were to establish a quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) assay to quantify the bacteria used in our 10-species in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm model and to compare the quantitative outcome with fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming  unit (cfu) counts on selective agar plates. material and methods: the 10 species  included in the in vitro biofilm were streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, actinomyces oris, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. the numbers of each species were quantified at two time points using qpcr, microscopy counting following fluorescence in-situ hybridization (fish) or immunofluorescence staining, and counting of cfus after growth on selective agar plates. results: all 10 species were successfully quantified using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, and the eight species culturable on selective agar plates were also quantified by counting the numbers  of cfus after growth on selective agar. in early biofilm cultures, all methods showed a significant correlation, although the absolute numbers differed between  methods. in late biofilm cultures, measurements obtained using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, but not by cfu counts, maintained significant correlation. cfu counts yielded lower values than did measurements made using the other two methods. conclusion: quantitative pcr and epifluorescence microscopy can be easily combined with each other to determine species-specific bacterial numbers within biofilms. however, conventional bacterial cultures cannot be as efficiently combined using these molecular detection methods. this may be crucial in designing and selecting appropriate clinical diagnostic methods for subgingival biofilm samples.

TI  == isolation and identification of porphyromonas spp. and other putative pathogens from cats with periodontal disease.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the subgingival microbiota and determine the most prevalent periodontal pathogens implicated in feline periodontal disease and to correlate these findings with the clinical periodontal status. subgingival microbiological samples were taken under sedation from 50 cats with clinical signs of periodontal disease. pooled paper point samples from  4 selected subgingival sites were cultured on blood agar and on dentaid-1 medium. suspected pathogens were identified, subcultured, and preserved. the association  between the microbiological findings and the clinical status was studied using correlation coefficients (cc). in addition, cats were stratified in subgroups according to presence of putative pathogens, and comparisons were carried out using unpaired t-test. three bacterial species were frequently detected including porphyromonas gulae (86%), porphyromonas circumdentaria (70%) and fusobacterium nucleatum (90%). the mean proportion of total flora was high for p. gulae (32.54%), moderate for p. circundentaria (8.82%), and low for f. nucleatum (3.96%). among the clinical variables, tooth mobility was correlated (cc > 0.50,  p < 0.001) with recession, pocket depth, attachment level, gingival index, and calculus index (cc = 0.29, p = 0.04) as well as with total bacterial counts (cc = 0.38, p = 0.006). cats with more than 10% of p. gulae showed significantly more mobility (p = 0.014) and recession (p = 0.038), and a tendency for deeper probing pocket depths (p = 0.084) and attachment loss (p = 0.087). the results from this  cross-sectional study confirmed that p. gulae is the most relevant pathogen in periodontal disease in cats.

TI  == antibacterial activity of probiotic candidates for oral health.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the probiotic potential of autochthonous oral lactobacilli. for this, 66 strains were screened for antibacterial activity  against two cariogenic strains (streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus) and two periodontopathogenic strains (fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis). the inhibitory activity was investigated with the agar overlay technique. positive results led us to explore some mechanisms of action. the ability to produce h(2)o(2) and the glycerol dehydratase gene were searched among all the strains. the gassericin a gene was checked among the lactobacillus gasseri. all the tested strains inhibited s. mutans and a. viscosus; only one did not inhibited f. nucleatum and 52 strains inhibited slightly the growth of p. gingivalis. no inactivation of antibacterial activity was observed after treatment with proteinase k. the gene of the gassericin a was not found in any strain. only one strain showed a 275-bp amplicon corresponding to the glycerol dehydratase gene. this strain has been identified by dna 16s sequencing as a l. gasseri. among the 66 tested strains, 7 produced hydrogen peroxide. our findings  suggest that in addition to the previous results, some of the autochthonous oral  lactobacilli tested could be considered as suitable probiotics.

AB  == background and objective: beta-lactam antibiotics prescribed in periodontal therapy are vulnerable to degradation by bacterial beta-lactamases. this study evaluated the occurrence of beta-lactamase-positive subgingival bacteria in chronic periodontitis subjects of usa origin, and assessed their in vitro resistance to metronidazole at a breakpoint concentration of 4 mug/ml. material and methods: subgingival plaque specimens from deep periodontal pockets with bleeding on probing were removed from 564 adults with severe chronic periodontitis before treatment. the samples were transported in vmga iii and then plated onto: (i) nonselective enriched brucella blood agar (ebba) and incubated anaerobically for 7 d; and (ii) selective trypticase soy-bacitracin-vancomycin (tsbv) and incubated for 3 d in air + 5% co2 . at the end of the incubation periods, the bacterial test species were identified and quantified. specimen dilutions were also plated onto ebba plates supplemented with 2 mug/ml of amoxicillin, a combination of 2 mug/ml of amoxicillin plus 2 mug/ml of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid, or 4 mug/ml of metronidazole, followed  by anaerobic incubation for 7 d. bacterial test species presumptively positive for beta-lactamase production were identified by growth on ebba primary isolation plates supplemented with amoxicillin alone and no growth on ebba primary isolation plates containing both amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. a subset of such isolates was subjected to nitrocefin-based chromogenic disk testing to confirm the presence of beta-lactamase activity. in vitro resistance to 4 mug/ml  of metronidazole was noted when growth of test species occurred on metronidazole-supplemented ebba culture plates. results: two-hundred and ninety-four (52.1%) of the study subjects yielded beta-lactamase-producing subgingival bacterial test species, with prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum and other prevotella species most frequently identified as beta-lactamase-producing organisms. of the beta-lactamase-producing bacterial  test species strains recovered, 98.9% were susceptible in vitro to metronidazole  at 4 mug/ml. conclusion: the occurrence of beta-lactamase-positive subgingival bacterial species in more than half of the subjects with severe chronic periodontitis raises questions about the therapeutic potential of single-drug regimens with beta-lactam antibiotics in periodontal therapy. the in vitro effectiveness of metronidazole against nearly all recovered beta-lactamase-producing subgingival bacterial species further supports clinical  periodontitis treatment strategies involving the combination of systemic amoxicillin plus metronidazole.

TI  == effects of cranberry components on human aggressive periodontitis gingival fibroblasts.
AB  == background and objective: aggressive periodontitis (agp) causes rapid periodontal breakdown involving agp gingival fibroblast production of cytokines [i.e. interleukin (il)-6, a bone metabolism regulator], and matrix metalloproteinase (mmp)-3. lipopolysaccharide upregulates fibroblast il-6 and mmp-3, via transcription factors (i.e. nf-kappab). cranberry (vaccinium macrocarpon) inhibits lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophage and normal gingival fibroblast  activities, but little is known of its effects on agp fibroblasts. objectives of  this study are to use agp fibroblasts, to determine cytotoxicity of cranberry components or periodontopathogen (fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis) lipopolysaccharide +/- cranberry components, and effects of cranberry components on lipopolysaccharide-stimulated nf-kappab activation and il-6 and mmp-3 production. material and methods: agp fibroblasts were incubated </= 6 d with high molecular weight non-dialyzable material (ndm) (derived from cranberry  juice (1-500 mug/ml) or lipopolysaccharide (1 mug/ml) +/- ndm. membrane damage and viability were assessed by enzyme activity released into cell supernatants and activity of a mitochondrial enzyme, respectively. secreted il-6 and mmp-3 were measured by elisa. nf-kappab p65 was measured via binding to an oligonucleotide containing the nf-kappab consensus site. data were analyzed using analysis of variance and scheffe's f procedure for post hoc comparisons. results: short-term exposure to ndm, or lipopolysaccharide +/- ndm caused no membrane damage. ndm (</= 100 mug/ml) or lipopolysaccharide +/- ndm had no effect on viability </= 7 d exposure. ndm (50 mug/ml) inhibited lipopolysaccharide-stimulated p65 (p </= 0.003) and constitutive or lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mmp-3 (p </= 0.02). ndm increased agp fibroblast constitutive or lipopolysaccharide-stimulated il-6 (p </= 0.0001), but inhibited  normal human gingival fibroblast il-6 (p </= 0.01). conclusion: lack of toxicity  of low ndm concentrations, and its inhibition of nf-kappab and mmp-3, suggest that cranberry components may regulate agp fibroblast inflammatory responses. distinct effects of ndm on agp and gingival fibroblast production of il-6 (which  can have both positive and negative effects on bone metabolism) may reflect phenotypic differences in il-6 regulation in the two cell types.

TI  == genome-wide association study of periodontal pathogen colonization.
AB  == pathological shifts of the human microbiome are characteristic of many diseases,  including chronic periodontitis. to date, there is limited evidence on host genetic risk loci associated with periodontal pathogen colonization. we conducted a genome-wide association (gwa) study among 1,020 white participants of the atherosclerosis risk in communities study, whose periodontal diagnosis ranged from healthy to severe chronic periodontitis, and for whom "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization quantification of 8 periodontal pathogens was performed. we examined 3 traits: "high red" and "high orange" bacterial complexes, and "high" aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) colonization. genotyping was performed on the affymetrix 6.0 platform. imputation to 2.5 million markers was based on hapmap ii-ceu, and a multiple-test correction was applied (genome-wide threshold  of p < 5 x 10(-8)). we detected no genome-wide significant signals. however, 13 loci, including kcnk1, fbxo38, uhrf2, il33, runx2, trps1, camta1, and vamp3, provided suggestive evidence (p < 5 x 10(-6)) of association. all associations reported for "red" and "orange" complex microbiota, but not for aa, had the same  effect direction in a second sample of 123 african-american participants. none of these polymorphisms was associated with periodontitis diagnosis. investigations replicating these findings may lead to an improved understanding of the complex nature of host-microbiome interactions that characterizes states of health and disease.

TI  == proteomics of streptococcus gordonii within a model developing oral microbial community.
AB  == background: streptococcus gordonii is one of several species that can initiate the formation of oral biofilms that develop into the complex multispecies microbial communities referred to as dental plaque. it is in the context of dental plaque that periodontal pathogens such as porphyromonas gingivalis cause disease. we have previously reported a whole cell quantitative proteomics investigation of p. gingivalis in a model dental plaque community of s. gordonii, p. gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. here we report the adaptation of s. gordonii to the same model. results: 1122 s. gordonii proteins were detected in s. gordonii control samples, 915 in communities with f. nucleatum, 849 with p. gingivalis, and 649 with all three organisms. quantitative comparisons showed extensive proteome changes in association with f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis individually or both p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum together. the changes were species specific, though the p. gingivalis interaction may be dominant, indicated by large differences between the proteomes with f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis but limited changes between communities with p. gingivalis or both p. gingivalis and  f. nucleatum. the results were inspected manually and an ontology analysis conducted using david. extensive changes were seen in nutrition pathways with increases in energy metabolism and changes in the resulting byproducts, while the acid and sugar repressed pts (phosphoenolpyruvate dependent phosphotransferase system) sugar transport systems showed decreases. these results were seen across  all the multispecies samples, though with different profiles according to the partner species. f. nucleatum association decreased proteins for the metabolic end products acetate and ethanol but increased lactate, the primary source of acidity from streptococcal cultures. p. gingivalis containing samples had a reduction in levels of proteins for ethanol and formate but increased proteins for both acetate and lactate production. the communities also showed increases in exopolysaccharide synthesis, amino acid biosynthesis, and oxidative stress protection and decreases in adhesion and transporter proteins. conclusion: this study showed that s. gordonii demonstrates species specific responses during interactions with f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis. extensive changes were seen in energy metabolism and byproduct production implicating nutrient transfer as an important community interaction.

TI  == isothermal microcalorimetry provides new insights into biofilm variability and dynamics.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate a three-species in vitro biofilm with peri-implantitis-related bacteria for its variability and metabolic activity. streptococcus sanguinis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis were suspended in simulated body fluid containing 0.2% glucose to form biofilms on polished, protein-coated implant-grade titanium disks over 72 h using a flow chamber system. thereafter, biofilm-coated disks were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridization/confocal laser scanning microscopy. to assess metabolic activity within the biofilms, their heat flow was recorded for 480 h at 37 degrees c by imc. the microscopic methods revealed that the total number of bacteria in the biofilms varied slightly among specimens (2.59 x 10(4) +/- 0.67 x 10(4) cells mm(-2) ), whereas all three species were found constantly with unchanged proportions (s. sanguinis  41.3 +/- 4.8%, f. nucleatum 17.7 +/- 2.1%, and p. gingivalis 41.0 +/- 4.9%). imc  revealed minor differences in time-to-peak heat flow (20.6 +/- 4.5 h), a trend consistent with the small variation in bacterial species proportions as shown by  microscopy. peak heat flow (35.8 +/- 42.6 muw), mean heat flow (13.1 +/- 22.0 muw), and total heat over 480 h (23.5 +/- 37.2 j) showed very high variation. these imc results may be attributed to differences in the initial cell counts and relative proportions of the three species, their distribution and embedment in exopolysaccharide matrix on the test specimens. the present results provide new insights into variability and dynamics of biofilms on titanium disks, aspects that should be explored in future studies of dental surfaces.

TI  == bacterial antagonism against periodontopathogens.
AB  == background: the aim of the current study is to compare the prevalence of commensal bacteria, with beneficial properties, for healthy and diseased individuals and additionally to examine the inhibitory effect of some commercial  dietary probiotics on periodontopathogens, comparing this inhibitory effect to that of orally derived beneficial bacteria. methods: subgingival plaque samples from 35 patients (healthy and periodontitis patients) were analyzed. growth inhibition of the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was examined using the agar overlay technique and agar well diffusion method. the quantification of the inhibitory effect was checked with the agar well diffusion  method. results: using the agar overlay technique, the prevalence of strains antagonistic toward p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and f. nucleatum was found to be higher in healthy individuals than in individuals with periodontitis, but this could not be validated by the agar well diffusion assay. compared with the antagonistic activity of the isolated strains, the probiotic strains overall  showed a stronger inhibition of the periodontal pathogens. conclusion: it was shown that some oral bacteria can cause antagonism toward periodontopathogens, and these observations underline the therapeutic potential of applications that stimulate oral health by the application of beneficial effector strains.

TI  == micronutrient modulation of nf-kappab in oral keratinocytes exposed to periodontal bacteria.
AB  == chronic periodontal diseases are characterised by a dysregulated and exaggerated  inflammatory/immune response to plaque bacteria. we have demonstrated previously  that oral keratinocytes up-regulate key molecular markers of inflammation, including nf-kappab and cytokine signalling, when exposed to the periodontal bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum in vitro. the purpose of the current study was to investigate whether alpha-lipoic acid was able to abrogate bacterially-induced pro-inflammatory changes in the h400 oral epithelial cell line. initial studies indicated that alpha-lipoic acid supplementation (1-4 mm) significantly reduced cell attachment; lower concentrations (<0.5 mm) enabled >85% cell adhesion at 24 h. while a pro-inflammatory response, demonstrable by nf-kappab translocation, gene expression and protein production was evident in h400 cells following exposure to p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, pre-incubation of cells with 0.5 mm alpha-lipoic  acid modulated this response. alpha-lipoic acid pre-treatment significantly decreased levels of bacterially-induced nf-kappab activation and il-8 protein production, and differentially modulated transcript levels for il-8, il-1beta, tnf-alpha and gm-csf, tlr2, 4, 9, s100a8, s100a9, lysyl oxidase, nf-kappab1, hmox, and sod2. overall, the data indicate that alpha-lipoic acid exerts an anti-inflammatory effect on oral epithelial cells exposed to periodontal bacteria and thus may provide a novel adjunctive treatment for periodontal diseases.

TI  == antibacterial effects of blackberry extract target periodontopathogens.
AB  == background and objective: antimicrobial agents provide valuable adjunctive therapy for the prevention and the control of oral diseases. limitations in their prolonged use have stimulated the search for new, naturally occurring agents with more specific activity and fewer adverse effects. here we sought to determine the antibacterial properties of blackberry extract (bbe) in vitro against oral bacterial commensals and periodontopathogens. material and methods: the effects of whole and fractionated bbe on the metabolism of 10 different oral bacteria were evaluated using the colorimetric water-soluble tetrazolium-1 assay. the bactericidal effects of whole bbe against fusobacterium nucleatum were determined by quantitating the numbers of colony-forming units (cfus). cytotoxicity was determined in oral epithelial (okf6) cells. results: bbe at 350-1400 mug/ml reduced the metabolic activity of porphyromonas gingivalis, f. nucleatum and streptococcus mutans. the reduced metabolic activity observed for f. nucleatum corresponded to a reduction in the numbers of cfus following exposure to bbe for  as little as 1 h, indicative of its bactericidal properties. an anthocyanin-enriched fraction of bbe reduced the metabolic activity of f. nucleatum, but not of p. gingivalis or s. mutans, suggesting the contribution of  species-specific agents in the whole bbe. oral epithelial cell viability was not  reduced following exposure to whole bbe (2.24-1400 mug/ml) for </= 6 h. conclusion: bbe alters the metabolic activity of oral periodontopathogens while demonstrating a minimal effect on commensals. the specific antibacterial properties of bbe shown in this study, along with its previously demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, make this natural extract a promising target as an adjunct for prevention and/or complementary therapy of periodontal infections.

TI  == insights into the virulence of oral biofilms: discoveries from proteomics.
AB  == this review covers developments in the study of polymicrobial communities, biofilms and selected areas of host response relevant to dental plaque and related areas of oral biology. the emphasis is on recent studies in which proteomic methods, particularly those using mass spectrometry as a readout, have  played a major role in the investigation. the last 5-10 years have seen a transition of such methods from the periphery of oral biology to the mainstream,  as in other areas of biomedical science. for reasons of focus and space, the authors do not discuss biomarker studies relevant to improved diagnostics for oral health, as this literature is rather substantial in its own right and deserves a separate treatment. here, global gene regulation studies of plaque-component organisms, biofilm formation, multispecies interactions and host-microbe interactions are discussed. several aspects of proteomics methodology that are relevant to the studies of multispecies systems are commented upon.

TI  == efficacy of berberine, an antimicrobial plant alkaloid, as an endodontic irrigant against a mixed-culture biofilm in an in vitro tooth model.
AB  == introduction: berberine, a plant alkaloid isolated from many medicinal plants, has shown antimicrobial activity against selected oral pathogens. the purpose of  this investigation was to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of berberine solution against selected endodontic pathogens using a multispecies biofilm tooth model. methods: the bacterial species used in the multispecies biofilm tooth model were fusobacterium nucleatum, enterococcus faecalis, and prevotella intermedia. extracted human anterior teeth were collected and standardized to a length of 14.0 mm. teeth were cultured in schaedler broth with the 3 test bacteria strains for 21 days and then randomly assigned to 6 treatment groups (ie, sterile saline, 5.25% naocl, 2% chlorhexidine [chx], 1% chx, 2 mg/ml berberine, and 1 mg/ml berberine plus 1% chx). the teeth were instrumented to size 35/.06 and irrigated with 6 ml irrigant for 2 minutes. surviving bacteria were sampled before and after instrumentation. data were analyzed using analysis  of variance (p < .05) followed by the scheffe test. results: the minimal inhibitory concentration of berberine against f. nucleatum, p. intermedia, and e. faecalis was 31.25 mug/ml, 3.8 mug/ml, and 500 mug/ml, respectively. instrumentation and irrigation resulted in 99% bacterial reduction in all groups. all tested solutions resulted in a statistically significant reduction in bacteria when compared with the saline control. when used alone, berberine (2 mg/ml) was less effective than the other test irrigants. however, when combined with 1% chx, berberine (2 mg/ml) was comparable in bactericidal activity with 5.25% naocl, 2% chx, and 1% chx (table 2). conclusions: berberine was more effective than saline as an endodontic irrigant against selected endodontic pathogens in vitro and, when combined with chx, was comparable with naocl in its  bactericidal efficacy.

TI  == comparison of endotoxin levels found in primary and secondary endodontic infections.
AB  == introduction: this clinical study was conducted to compare the levels of endotoxins (lipopolysaccharides [lpss]) found in primary and secondary endodontic infections with apical periodontitis by correlating lps contents with clinical/radiographic findings. in addition, the presence of target gram-negative anaerobic bacteria was also investigated. methods: samples were taken from 15 root canals with primary infections and 15 with secondary infections by using paper points. the limulus amebocyte lysate assay was used to quantify endotoxins, and the polymerase chain reaction technique (16s rdna) was used for bacterial investigation. results: endotoxins were detected in 100% of the root canal samples collected from primary (15/15) and secondary (15/15) infections with median values of 7.49 eu/ml and 3.96 eu/ml, respectively (p < .05). the median value of endotoxins found in the presence of clinical symptoms was significantly  higher than in asymptomatic teeth with primary infections (p < .05). a positive correlation was found between endotoxin contents and a larger size of the radiolucent area (>3 mm) (p < .05). prevotella nigrescens (10/15, 4/15), fusobacterium nucleatum (5/15, 1/15), treponema denticola (3/15, 1/15), and treponema socranskii (5/15, 1/15) were detected in teeth with primary and secondary infections, respectively. p. endodontalis was present only in teeth with primary infections (5/15). conclusions: teeth with primary endodontic infections had higher contents of endotoxins and a more complex gram-negative bacterial community than teeth with secondary infections. moreover, the levels of endotoxins were related to the severity of bone destruction in periapical tissues as well as the development of clinical features in teeth with primary infections.

TI  == strain-specific colonization patterns and serum modulation of multi-species oral  biofilm development.
AB  == periodontitis results from an ecological shift in the composition of subgingival  biofilms. subgingival community maturation is modulated by inter-organismal interactions and the relationship of communities with the host. in an effort to better understand this process, we evaluated biofilm formation, with oral commensal species, by three strains of the subgingivally prevalent microorganism  fusobacterium nucleatum and four strains of the periodontopathogen porphyromonas  gingivalis. we also tested the effect of serum, which resembles gingival exudates, on subgingival biofilms. biofilms were allowed to develop in flow cells using salivary medium. we found that although not all strains of f. nucleatum were able to grow in mono-species biofilms, forming a community with health-associated partners actinomyces oris and veillonella parvula promoted biofilm growth of all f. nucleatum strains. strains of p. gingivalis also showed  variable ability to form mono-species biofilms. p. gingivalis w50 and w83 did not form biofilms, while atcc 33277 and 381 formed biofilm structures, but only strain atcc 33277 grew over time. unlike the enhanced growth of f. nucleatum with the two health-associated species, no strain of p. gingivalis grew in three-species communities with a. oris and v. parvula. however, addition of f. nucleatum facilitated growth of p. gingivalis atcc 33277 with health-associated partners. importantly, serum negatively affected the adhesion of f. nucleatum, while it favored biofilm growth by p. gingivalis. this work highlights strain specificity in subgingival biofilm formation. environmental factors such as serum alter the colonization patterns of oral microorganisms and could impact subgingival biofilms by selectively promoting pathogenic species.

TI  == subgingival biodiversity in subjects with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes and chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: there is a bidirectional relationship between periodontal disease and type-2 diabetes mellitus (dm). inflammatory mediators may negatively affect glycemic control, and increased glucose levels and resultant glycation end-products may alter the host response against bacterial infection. however, no agreement has been reached regarding the effect of dm on periodontal  subgingival microbiota. therefore, the purpose of the present study was to compare the subgingival biodiversity in deep periodontal pockets of subjects with chronic periodontitis and either uncontrolled type-2 diabetes or no diabetes using 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing. material and methods: twelve subjects with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes (glycated hemoglobin > 8%) and eleven nondiabetic subjects presenting severe and generalized chronic periodontitis were selected. subgingival biofilm from periodontal pockets > 5 mm were assessed using the 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing technique. results: significant differences were observed in subgingival microbiota between diabetic and nondiabetic subjects. diabetic subjects presented higher percentages of total clones of tm7, aggregatibacter, neisseria, gemella, eikenella, selenomonas, actinomyces, capnocytophaga, fusobacterium, veillonella and streptococcus genera, and lower percentages of porphyromonas, filifactor, eubacterium, synergistetes, tannerella and treponema genera than nondiabetic individuals (p < 0.05). moreover, some phylotypes, such as fusobacterium nucleatum, veillonella parvula,  v. dispar and eikenella corrodens were detected significantly more often in diabetic subjects than in nondiabetic subjects (p < 0.05). conclusion: subjects with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes and chronic periodontitis presented significant dissimilarities in subgingival biodiversity compared with nondiabetic subjects.

TI  == autoinducer 2 of fusobacterium nucleatum as a target molecule to inhibit biofilm  formation of periodontopathogens.
AB  == periodontitis is initiated by bacteria in subgingival biofilms, which are composed mostly of gram-negative anaerobes. autoinducer 2 (ai-2) is a universal quorum sensing (qs) molecule that mediates intergeneric signalling in multispecies bacterial communities and may induce biofilm formation. as fusobacterium nucleatum is the major coaggregation bridge organism that links early colonising commensals and late pathogenic colonisers in dental biofilms via the accretion of periodontopathogens, we hypothesised that ai-2 of f. nucleatum contributes to this interspecies interaction, and interruption of this signalling could result in the inhibition of biofilm formation of periodontopathogens. to test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effect of partially purified f. nucleatum  ai-2 on monospecies biofilm as well as mutualistic interactions between f. nucleatum and the so-called 'red complex' (porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia). then we tested the effect of two qs inhibitors (qsis), (5z)-4-bromo-5-(bromomethylene)-2(5h)-furanone (furanone compound) and d-ribose, on ai-2-induced biofilm formation and coaggregation. f. nucleatum ai-2 remarkably induced biofilm growth of single and dual species and coaggregation between f. nucleatum and each species of the 'red complex', all of  which were inhibited by the qsis. f. nucleatum ai-2 induced the expression of the representative adhesion molecules of the periodontopathogens, which were inhibited by the qsis. our results demonstrate that f. nucleatum ai-2 plays an important role in inter- and intraspecies interactions between periodontopathogens via enhanced expression of adhesion molecules and may be a target for the inhibition of pathogenic dental biofilm formation.

TI  == human salivary cystatin sa exhibits antimicrobial effect against aggregatibacter  actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == background and objective: healthy subjects who do not have aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in their oral cavity may possess factors in saliva that might demonstrate antibacterial activity against the bacterium. the aim of this study was to identify and purify proteins from saliva of healthy subjects that might demonstrate antibacterial activity against a. actinomycetemcomitans and test the same against the bacteria. material and methods: saliva from 10 healthy  volunteers was tested individually for its anti-a. actinomycetemcomitans activity. among the 10 subjects, eight demonstrated anti-a. actinomycetemcomitans activity. saliva was collected from one healthy volunteer who demonstrated the highest antimicrobial activity against a. actinomycetemcomitans. after clarifying the saliva, it was subjected to an affinity chromatography column with a. actinomycetemcomitans. the proteins bound to a. actinomycetemcomitans were eluted from the column and identified using mass spectrometry (maldi-tof/tof ms). among  other proteins that bound to a. actinomycetemcomitans, which included lactoferrin, immunoglobulin a and kallikrein, cystatin sa was observed in significantly higher concentrations, and this was purified from the eluate. the purified cystatin sa was tested at different concentrations for its ability to kill a. actinomycetemcomitans in a 2 h cell killing assay. the bacteria were also treated with a proteinase inhibitor, leupeptin, to clarify whether the antimicrobial effect of cystatin sa was related to its protease inhibitory function. cystatin sa was also tested for its ability to prevent binding of a. actinomycetemcomitans to buccal epithelial cells (becs) in an a. actinomycetemcomitans-bec binding assay. results: cystatin sa (0.1 mg/ml) demonstrated a statistically significant antimicrobial activity against a. actinomycetemcomitans. the effect of cystatin sa decreased with lower concentrations, with 0.01 mg/ml showing no effect. the addition of monoclonal cystatin sa antibodies to the purified sample completely negated the antimicrobial effect. treatment of a. actinomycetemcomitans with leupeptin resulted in no antimicrobial effect, suggesting that the antimicrobial activity of cystatin sa is independent of its protease inhibitory function. a. actinomycetemcomitans pretreated with cystatin sa showed reduced binding to becs, suggesting a potential role for cystatin sa in decreasing the colonization of a.  actinomycetemcomitans. conclusion: the present study shows that cystatin sa demonstrates antimicrobial activity against the periodontopathogen a. actinomycetemcomitans, and future studies determining the mechanism of action are necessary. the study also shows the ability of cystatin sa to reduce significantly the binding of a. actinomycetemcomitans to becs.

AB  == tannerella forsythia is strongly associated with chronic periodontitis, an inflammatory disease of the tooth-supporting tissues, leading to tooth loss. fusobacterium nucleatum, an opportunistic pathogen, is thought to promote dental  plaque formation by serving as a bridge bacterium between early- and late-colonizing species of the oral cavity. previous studies have shown that f. nucleatum species synergize with t. forsythia during biofilm formation and pathogenesis. in the present study, we showed that coinfection of f. nucleatum and t. forsythia is more potent than infection with either species alone in inducing nf-kappab activity and proinflammatory cytokine secretion in monocytic cells and primary murine macrophages. moreover, in a murine model of periodontitis, mixed infection with the two species induces synergistic alveolar  bone loss, characterized by bone loss which is greater than the additive alveolar bone losses induced by each species alone. further, in comparison to the single-species infection, mixed infection caused significantly increased inflammatory cell infiltration in the gingivae and osteoclastic activity in the jaw bones. these data show that f. nucleatum subspecies and t. forsythia synergistically stimulate the host immune response and induce alveolar bone loss  in a murine experimental periodontitis model.

TI  == serum antibodies to periodontal pathogens are a risk factor for alzheimer's disease.
AB  == background: chronic inflammation in periodontal disease has been suggested as a potential risk factor in alzheimer's disease (ad). the purpose of this study was  to examine serum antibody levels to bacteria of periodontal disease in participants who eventually converted to ad compared with the antibody levels in  control subjects. methods: serum samples from 158 participants in the biologically resilient adults in neurological studies research program at the university of kentucky were analyzed for immunoglobulin g antibody levels to seven oral bacteria associated with periodontitis, including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, treponema  denticola, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia. all 158 participants were cognitively intact at baseline venous blood draw. in all, 81 of the participants developed either mild cognitive impairment (mci) or ad or both, and 77 controls remained cognitively intact in the years of  follow-up. antibody levels were compared between controls and subjects with ad at baseline draw and after conversion and controls and subjects with mci at baseline draw and after conversion using the wilcoxon rank-sum test. ad and mci participants were not directly compared. linear regression models were used to adjust for potential confounding. results: antibody levels to f nucleatum and p intermedia were significantly increased (alpha = 0.05) at baseline serum draw in  the patients with ad compared with controls. these results remained significant when controlling for baseline age, mini-mental state examination score, and apolipoprotein epsilon 4 status. conclusions: this study provides initial data that demonstrate elevated antibodies to periodontal disease bacteria in subjects  years before cognitive impairment and suggests that periodontal disease could potentially contribute to the risk of ad onset/progression. additional cohort studies profiling oral clinical presentation with systemic response and ad and prospective studies to evaluate any cause-and-effect association are warranted.

TI  == bacterial and inflammatory behavior of implants in the early healing phase of chronic periodontitis.
AB  == objective: to assess the pattern of early bacterial colonization at implants and  teeth in patients with a history of chronic periodontitis compared with a group of healthy subjects. furthermore, the presence of host-derived markers at teeth and implants in the two subject groups was determined. method and materials: subgingival and submucosal plaque and gingival crevicular fluid samples from 37 nonsubmerged healing dental implants and the deepest tooth sites per quadrant were analyzed 2 to 5 months after implant insertion. the presence of periodontal  pathogens was assessed by means of real-time polymerase chain reaction. further,  the levels of interleukin (il)-1beta, il-8, and il-10; secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor; and the neutrophil elastase activity were determined. results: eleven patients with chronic periodontitis and 13 subjects without periodontitis were recruited for this study. bacterial species associated with periodontitis were detectable at both the teeth and implants. the presence was always higher in the chronic periodontitis group; the difference was significant  for porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans at both the implants and teeth. the levels of il-1beta were higher at teeth than at implants; in contrast, more il-10 was measured at the implants. conclusion: the present results indicate that (1) dental implants inserted in periodontally compromised patients are colonized with periodontal pathogens within the first weeks of healing; (2) inflammatory markers (il-1beta) are present in higher levels at teeth as compared with implants, whereas at implants, anti-inflammatory cytokines (il-10) might play the important role; and (3) the importance of periodontal treatment prior to implant insertion to reduce bacterial load and inflammation should be emphasized.

TI  == using high throughput sequencing to explore the biodiversity in oral bacterial communities.
AB  == high throughput sequencing of 16s ribosomal rna gene amplicons is a cost-effective method for characterization of oral bacterial communities. however, before undertaking large-scale studies, it is necessary to understand the technique-associated limitations and intrinsic variability of the oral ecosystem. in this work we evaluated bias in species representation using an in vitro-assembled mock community of oral bacteria. we then characterized the bacterial communities in saliva and buccal mucosa of five healthy subjects to investigate the power of high throughput sequencing in revealing their diversity  and biogeography patterns. mock community analysis showed primer and dna isolation biases and an overestimation of diversity that was reduced after eliminating singleton operational taxonomic units (otus). sequencing of salivary  and mucosal communities found a total of 455 otus (0.3% dissimilarity) with only  78 of these present in all subjects. we demonstrate that this variability was partly the result of incomplete richness coverage even at great sequencing depths, and so comparing communities by their structure was more effective than comparisons based solely on membership. with respect to oral biogeography, we found inter-subject variability in community structure was lower than site differences between salivary and mucosal communities within subjects. these differences were evident at very low sequencing depths and were mostly caused by  the abundance of streptococcus mitis and gemella haemolysans in mucosa. in summary, we present an experimental and data analysis framework that will facilitate design and interpretation of pyrosequencing-based studies. despite challenges associated with this technique, we demonstrate its power for evaluation of oral diversity and biogeography patterns.

TI  == butyric acid induces apoptosis in both human monocytes and lymphocytes equivalently.
AB  == short-chain fatty acids (scfas) are metabolites from anaerobic periodontopathic bacteria that induce apoptosis in immune cells such as lymphocytes, monocytes and macrophages. however, it remains unclear if scfas from pathogens induce apoptosis in monocytes/macrophages similarly with lymphocytes. this study investigated whether scfas-induced apoptosis is equal among the immunoregulatory cells. cell apoptosis of the employed human cells was evaluated after treatment with culture  supernatants from various periodontopathic bacteria or sodium butyrate. apoptosis and viability were determined by detection of dna fragmentation and using an mts  assay kit, respectively. porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum culture filtrates strongly induced apoptosis whereas prevotella nigrescens and prevotella intermedia culture filtrates failed to induce apoptosis in the thp-1 and u937 human monocyte and macrophage cell lines. healthy gingival fibroblasts and oral epithelial cells were resistant to all the culture filtrates. gas-liquid chromatography detected butyric acid in p. gingivalis (21.0-34.0 mm) and f. nucleatum (36.0 mm) in culture filtrates, whereas, only trace levels were seen in p. nigrescens and p. intermedia. these results suggest that butyric acid produced by periodontopathic bacteria severely damages immunoregulatory cells in a consistent manner and, likewise, could be involved in mediating periodontal chronic inflammation.

TI  == comparison of microbial changes in early redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.
AB  == background: surfaces and fluids can affect oral bacterial colonization. the aim of this study is to compare redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.  methods: supragingival plaque samples were taken from 55 dentate individuals and  the denture teeth of 62 edentulous individuals before and after professional cleaning. also, samples from seven "teeth" (samples included dentures) in randomly selected quadrants were collected after 1, 2, 4, and 7 days of no oral hygiene. samples were analyzed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. counts and proportions of 41 bacterial taxa were determined at each time point, and significant differences were determined using the mann-whitney u test. ecological succession was determined using a modified moving window analysis. results: mean  total dna probe counts were similar precleaning but were higher in dentate individuals at all post-cleaning visits (p <0.01). precleaning edentate biofilms  had higher counts and proportions of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus mutans, whereas dentate individuals had higher proportions of tannerella forsythia, selenomonas noxia, and neisseria mucosa. by day 2, mean counts of all taxa were higher in natural teeth, and most remained higher at day  7 (p <0.01). succession was more rapid and complex in dentate individuals. both groups demonstrated increased proportions of s. mitis and s. oralis by day 1. n.  mucosa, veillonella parvula, and eikenella corrodens increased in both groups, but later in samples from edentate individuals. conclusions: "mature" natural and denture teeth biofilms have similar total numbers of bacteria but different species proportions. post-cleaning biofilm redevelopment is more rapid and more complex on natural teeth than on denture teeth.

TI  == specificity of antimicrobial peptide ll-37 to neutralize periodontopathogenic lipopolysaccharide activity in human oral fibroblasts.
AB  == background: the antimicrobial peptide ll-37 is known to have a potent lipopolysaccharide (lps)-neutralizing activity in various cell types. because of  observed heterogeneity within periodontopathogenic lps, the authors hypothesized  that ll-37 had specificity to neutralize such lps activity. the present study, therefore, aims to investigate the lps-neutralizing activity of ll-37 to various  periodontopathogenic lps in interleukin-8 (il-8) production after challenging them in human oral fibroblasts. methods: human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (pdlf) and gingival fibroblasts (gf) were cultured from biopsies of periodontal ligament and gingival tissues. after cell confluence in 24-well plates, lps (10 mug/ml) from porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were added with or without ll-37 (10 mug/ml). after 18 hours, the supernatant was collected and analyzed in  il-8 production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: all periodontopathogenic lps statistically significantly induced il-8 production in both pdlf and gf (p <0.01). after neutralization with ll-37, both pdlf and gf showed a statistically significant reduction in il-8 production compared with lps-treated groups without ll-37 (p <0.01), and the percentage of reduction in il-8 production in pdlf appeared to be higher than in gf. in addition, the percentage of reduction in il-8 production varied considerably according to each  periodontopathogenic lps. conclusions: the antimicrobial peptide ll-37 had an ability to suppress periodontopathogenic lps-induced il-8 production in both pdlf and gf. its lps-neutralizing activity revealed specificity to periodontopathogenic lps and seemed to be dependent on the heterogeneity within lps between different genera.

TI  == human neutrophil defensins and their effect on epithelial cells.
AB  == background: the aims of the present study include: 1) to localize human neutrophil defensin-1 (hnp-1) through hnp-3 in gingiva and in neutrophil extract-treated epithelial cell monolayers; 2) to determine the effects of hnp-1  on the epithelial cell viability, attachment, and spreading; and 3) to analyze the effect of hnp-1 on the bacterial adherence to epithelial cells. methods: for  localization of hnp-1 through hnp-3 in gingival tissue and in preincubated cell monolayers, immunohistochemical and immunocytochemical methods were used. viability and proliferation of epithelial cells were determined with commercial kits after incubating the keratinocytes with different hnp-1 concentrations (low, 1 to 5 mug/ml; moderate, 10 mug/ml; high, 20 to 50 mug/ml). attachment and spreading of keratinocytes on fibronectin-coated surfaces in the presence of hnp-1 were evaluated under microscope. attachment of fusobacterium nucleatum atcc25586 and prevotella intermedia atcc25611 on keratinocytes preincubated with  hnp-1 were determined with a standard antibiotic test. results: hnp-1 through hnp-3 localized in the junctional epithelium of clinically healthy gingiva and in the pocket epithelium of gingiva with periodontitis. when keratinocyte monolayers were incubated with neutrophil extracts, hnp-1 through hnp-3 were bound to the periphery of the growing cell colonies. in low hnp-1 concentrations, the keratinocyte proliferation enhanced. moderate and high concentrations of hnp-1 increased the cellular death significantly. hnp-1 increased the attachment and spreading of keratinocytes on fibronectin-coated surfaces and bacterial attachment to keratinocytes in a concentration-dependent manner. conclusion: hnp-1 plays a role in the integrity of keratinocytes by stimulating their proliferation, attachment, and spreading, whereas higher doses increase the bacterial attachment and keratinocyte death.

TI  == regenerative therapy of infrabony defects with or without systemic doxycycline. a randomized placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == aim: comparison of regenerative therapy of infrabony defects with and without administration of postsurgical systemic doxycycline (doxy). methods: in each of 61 patients one infrabony defect was treated with enamel matrix derivative (emd), emd plus filler or membrane at two centres. by random assignment patients received either 200 mg doxy per day or placebo (plac) for 7 days after surgery. prior to and 6 months after surgery probing pocket depths (ppd) and vertical attachment level (pal-v) were obtained. results: fifty-four patients (doxy: 27; plac: 27) were re-examined after 6 months and had been treated exclusively with emd. seven to 8 days after surgery 81% of defects in both groups showed complete  flap closure. in both groups significant (p < 0.001) ppd reduction (doxy: 3.87 +/- 1.44 mm; plac: 3.67 +/- 1.30 mm) and pal-v gain (doxy: 3.11 +/- 1.50 mm; plac: 3.32 +/- 1.83 mm) were observed. however, the differences failed to be statistically significant (ppd: 0.20; p = 0.588; pal-v: 0.21; p = 0.657). conclusions: two hundred milligram systemic doxy administered for 7 days after therapy of infrabony defects with emd failed to result in better ppd reduction and pal-v gain compared with plac which may be due to low power (50%) and, thus,  random chance.

TI  == association between oral malodour and periodontal disease-related parameters in the general population.
AB  == aim: to determine the association between halitosis detection and periodontal status in systemically healthy non-smokers and to assess whether halitosis was related to quantities of fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis on  the tongue dorsum. methods: periodontal examinations, tongue coating determination, halimeter(r) readings and organoleptic assessments of mouth odour  were performed in 28 chronic periodontitis patients, 23 chronic gingivitis patients and 27 healthy individuals. the quantities of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum were determined in tongue specimens by real-time pcr. results: halitosis was more likely to be detected in patients with periodontitis (or = 9.2) and gingivitis (or = 4.6) than in healthy subjects. the posterior tongue odour was similar for all groups; had the highest score of all organoleptic assessments and was significantly correlated with halimeter(r) scores and the odour of the whole mouth air. periodontitis patients harboured significantly greater amounts of p. gingivalis on their tongue, yet similar quantities of f. nucleatum compared to gingivitis patients and healthy subjects. the amount of p.  gingivalis residing on the tongue dorsum of periodontitis patients was significantly associated with halitosis recordings, while the amount of f. nucleatum was related to tongue coating in healthy controls, which corroborates its role in biofilm formation. conclusions: patients with periodontal disease were at higher risk for halitosis detection than healthy individuals. the posterior portion of the tongue dorsum seems to be an important source of odourous compounds, regardless of periodontal condition. p. gingivalis residing on the tongue of periodontitis patients may play a key role in oral malodour production.

TI  == molecular analysis of 16s rrna genes identifies potentially periodontal pathogenic bacteria and archaea in the plaque of partially erupted third molars.
AB  == purpose: small subunit rrna sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were used to identify cultivable and uncultivable microorganisms present in the dental plaque  of symptomatic and asymptomatic partially erupted third molars to determine the prevalence of putative periodontal pathogens in pericoronal sites. materials and  methods: template dna prepared from subgingival plaque collected from partially erupted symptomatic and asymptomatic mandibular third molars and healthy incisors was used in polymerase chain reaction with broad-range oligonucleotide primers to amplify 16s rrna bacterial and archaeal genes. amplicons were cloned, sequenced,  and compared with known nucleotide sequences in online databases to identify the  microorganisms present. results: two thousand three hundred two clones from the plaque of 12 patients carried bacterial sequences from 63 genera belonging to 11  phyla, including members of the uncultivable tm7, sr1, and chloroflexi, and difficult-to-cultivate synergistetes and spirochaetes. dialister invisus, filifactor alocis, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella denticola, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola, which have been associated with periodontal disease, were found in significantly greater abundance in pericoronal compared with incisor sites. dialister invisus and f nucleatum were found in greater abundance in sites exhibiting clinical symptoms.  the archaeal species, methanobrevibacter oralis, which has been associated with severe periodontitis, was found in 3 symptomatic patients. conclusions: these findings have provided new insights into the complex microbiota of pericoronitis. several bacterial and archaeal species implicated in periodontal disease were recovered in greater incidence and abundance from the plaque of partially erupted third molars compared with incisors, supporting the hypothesis that the pericoronal region may provide a favored niche for periodontal pathogens in otherwise healthy mouths.

TI  == oral microbial biofilm stimulation of epithelial cell responses.
AB  == oral bacterial biofilms trigger chronic inflammatory responses in the host that can result in the tissue destructive events of periodontitis. however, the characteristics of the capacity of specific host cell types to respond to these biofilms remain ill-defined. this report describes the use of a novel model of bacterial biofilms to stimulate oral epithelial cells and profile select cytokines and chemokines that contribute to the local inflammatory environment in the periodontium. monoinfection biofilms were developed with streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, actinomyces naeslundii,  fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis on rigid gas-permeable contact lenses. biofilms, as well as planktonic cultures of these same bacterial  species, were incubated under anaerobic conditions with a human oral epithelial cell line, okf4, for up to 24h. gro-1alpha, il1alpha, il-6, il-8, tgfalpha, fractalkine, mip-1alpha, and ip-10 were shown to be produced in response to a range of the planktonic or biofilm forms of these species. p. gingivalis biofilms significantly inhibited the production of all of these cytokines and chemokines,  except mip-1alpha. generally, the biofilms of all species inhibited gro-1alpha, tgfalpha, and fractalkine production, while f. nucleatum biofilms stimulated significant increases in il-1alpha, il-6, il-8, and ip-10. a. naeslundii biofilms induced elevated levels of il-6, il-8 and ip-10. the oral streptococcal species in biofilms or planktonic forms were poor stimulants for any of these mediators from the epithelial cells. the results of these studies demonstrate that oral bacteria in biofilms elicit a substantially different profile of responses compared to planktonic bacteria of the same species. moreover, certain oral species are highly stimulatory when in biofilms and interact with host cell receptors to trigger pathways of responses that appear quite divergent from individual bacteria.

AB  == objectives: we aimed to achieve detailed biomaterials characterization of a drug  delivery system for local periodontitis treatment based on electrospun metronidazole-loaded resorbable polylactide (pla) fibers. methods: pla fibers loaded with 0.1-40% (w/w) mna were electrospun and were characterized by sem and  dsc. hplc techniques were used to analyze the release profiles of metronidazole (mna) from these fibers. the antibacterial efficacy was determined by measuring inhibition zones of drug-containing aliquots from the same electrospun fiber mats in an agar diffusion test. three pathogenic periodontal bacterial strains: fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas  gingivalis were studied. cytotoxicity testing was performed with human gingival fibroblasts by: (i) counting viable cells via live/dead staining methods and (ii) by exposing cells directly onto the surface of mna-loaded fibers. results: mna concentration influenced fiber diameters and thus w/w surface areas: diameter being minimal and area maximal at 20% mna. hplc showed that these 20% mna fibers  had the fastest initial mna release. from the third day, mna release was slower and nearly linear with time. all fiber mats released 32-48% of their total drug content within the first 7 days. aliquots of media taken from the fiber mats inhibited the growth of all three bacterial strains. mna released up to the 28th  day from fiber mats containing 40% mna significantly decreased the viability of f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis and up to the 2nd day also for the resistant a. actinomycetemcomitans. all of the investigated fibers and aliquots showed excellent cytocompatibility. significance: this study shows that mna-loaded electrospun fiber mats represent an interesting class of resorbable drug delivery systems. sustained drug release properties and cytocompatibility suggest their potential clinical applicability for the treatment of periodontal diseases.

TI  == predominant bacterial species in subgingival plaque in dogs.
AB  == background and objective: the dog has been used extensively for experimental and  microbiological studies on periodontitis and peri-implantitis without detailed knowledge about the predominant flora of the subgingival plaque. this study was designed to evaluate the predominant cultivable bacterial species in dogs and compare them phenotypically and genotypically with corresponding human species. material and methods: four subgingival samples were taken from two upper premolars in each of six labrador retrievers. the samples from each dog were processed for anaerobic culture. from the samples of each dog, the five or six predominating bacteria based on colony morphology were selected and pure cultured. each of the strains was characterized by gram stain, anaerobic/aerobic  growth and api-zym test. eighteen strains showing clear-cut phenotypic differences were further classified based on dna sequencing technology. cross-reactions of dna probes from human and dog strains were also tested against a panel of both human and dog bacterial species. results: thirty-one strains in the dogs were isolated and characterized. they represented 21 different species,  of which six belonged to the genus porphyromonas. no species was found consistently in the predominant flora of all six dogs. porphyromonas crevioricanis and fusobacterium canifelinum were the two most prevalent species in predominant flora in dogs. dna probes from human and dog species cross-reacted to some extent with related strains from humans and dogs; however, distinct exceptions were found. conclusion: the predominant cultural subgingival flora in  dogs shows great similarities with the subgingival bacteria from humans at the genus level, but distinct differences at the species level; however, a genetic relatedness could be disclosed for most strains investigated.

AB  == background: deoxyribonucleic acids (dna) of periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas  gingivalis (pg) and tannerella forsythia, stimulate cytokine production in human  monocytic cells (thp-1) through toll-like receptor 9 (tlr-9) and nuclear factor-kappab signaling. fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) is one of the most frequently isolated bacteria in periodontally diseased tissues and is reported to synergize with pg, enhancing the pathogenicity. we investigate inflammatory mediator production in thp-1 cells challenged with fn and streptococcus sanguinis (ss) dna, a non-pathogenic oral bacteria, and further assess whether cytokines triggered by whole pathogens or pg lipopolysaccharide (lps) are affected by tlr-9 signaling inhibitors (chloroquine). methods: thp-1 cells were stimulated with pg-dna (100 ng/mul), fn-dna (100 ng/mul), ss-dna (100 ng/mul), pg-lps (10 ng/mul), and heat-killed whole bacteria (multiplicity of infection, 1:100) for 16 hours with or without chloroquine pretreatment (10 mug/ml). interleukin (il)-1beta, il-6, il-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. statistical analyses included analysis of variance with multiple comparisons using dunnett or tukey methods and paired t test. a value of p <0.05 was significant. results: inflammatory mediator levels were increased in response to all the stimuli with the exception of ss-dna (p <0.05). chloroquine pretreatment significantly decreased cytokine production from thp-1 cells with the exception of il-6 production triggered by whole fn and ss (p <0.05). conclusions: differences exist among oral bacterial dna in inducing immune responses. by altering the conditions in cytosolic compartments, we can interfere with cellular responses triggered by extracellular receptor activation. thus, alternative treatment approaches targeted to intracellular receptors might  be of benefit in controlling periodontal inflammation.

TI  == the adhesion of oral bacteria to modified titanium surfaces: role of plasma proteins and electrostatic forces.
AB  == objectives: modifications of titanium (ti) implant surfaces have a significant effect on early biofilm formation and the outcome of implant procedures. the aim  of this study was to examine the role of plasma proteins and electrostatic forces in the adhesion mechanism of oral bacteria to modified ti surfaces. materials and methods: ti discs with three different types of surface modifications, machined,  acid-etched, and acid-etched and blasted, were examined for adhesion of oral bacteria: streptococcus mutans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. following pretreatment of the ti with ion rich solutions or coating by human serum albumin or fibronectin, bacterial adhesion was examined by scanning electron microscopy and assessed quantitatively by dna analysis. ti coating by proteins as well as bacterial adhesion and their interrelationships were further  investigated through confocal scanning laser microscopy. results: acid-etched and blasted ti surfaces exhibited significantly higher amounts of bacteria adhesion than the other two surfaces. calcium was found to serve as a bridging agent in the adhesion process of s. mutans and f. nucleatum to ti surfaces. although albumin coating of the ti reduced the adhesion of s. mutans to all surfaces, it had no influence on the adhesion of p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum. coating the ti with fibronectin enhanced p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum adhesion. conclusions: bacterial adhesion to ti surfaces is roughness-dependent, and the adhesion mechanism is influenced by ions and proteins of the initial coating derived from  the blood.

TI  == investigation of six selected bacterial species in endo-periodontal lesions.
AB  == aim: to investigate and determine possible associations of six tested bacteria belonging to 'orange' and 'green' complexes, in endo-periodontal lesions: parvimonas micra, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium nodatum, eikenella corrodens and capnocytophaga sputigena. methodology: forty-six patients presenting with different types of endo-periodontal lesions were investigated. clinical examinations, periapical radiographs and microbiological sampling from the canal system (endo) and periodontal pockets (perio) were performed. qualitative and semiquantitative evaluation of bacteria was performed  by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and dna-dna hybridization (micro-ident plus; hain lifescience, germany). results: extremely high bacterial loads in endodontic samples were recorded for p. micra, f. nucleatum and c. sputigena, while periodontal samples were often colonized by the same species, plus c. rectus. significant association was recorded between f. nucleatum-endo and p. micra-endo  (p = 0.03, fisher's exact test). there was marginal evidence of associations between: (i) c. sputigena-endo and c. sputigena-perio (p = 0.06, fisher's exact test); (ii) p. micra-endo and p. micra-perio (p = 0.05, fisher's exact test). sensitivity to percussion was associated with an increased chance of cases with p. micra-endo (p = 0.03, pearson chi-square test). conclusion: the findings suggest that f. nucleatum, p. micra and c. sputigena may play a role in the pathogenesis of endo-periodontal lesions.

TI  == antimicrobial efficacy of denture adhesives on some oral malodor-related microbes.
AB  == the objective of the study was to determine the antimicrobial efficacy of three denture adhesives toward streptococcus oralis, mutans, prevotella oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum. adhesives used were corega ultra((r)), fixodent pro original((r)) and biotene((r)) denture grip. for streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mutans, four tubes of trypticase soy broth 10 ml and 1 g denture of adhesive were used. in addition four tubes of trypticase soy broth 10 ml without  any denture adhesive was employed as control. for prevotella oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum, four tubes of thioglycolate 10 ml and 1 g denture adhesive were used for each one, while four tubes of thioglycolate 10 ml without  adhesive served as control. all samples were incubated for 48 h at 37 degrees c.  after 48 h, the number of colonies was counted and the mean was extracted as cfu/ml. the results were evaluated with anova on ranked data and tukey's post hoc test at alpha = 0.05. streptococcus oralis, mutans, prevotella oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum showed decreased number of colonies for each denture adhesive compared to the control. under the conditions of this in vitro study, all the tested denture adhesives showed antimicrobial efficacy. however, in contrast to the hypothesis, there were differences among them. corega ultra((r))  and biotene((r)) denture grip were more effective for all the tested oral malodor-related microbes than fixodent pro original((r)).

TI  == isoflavonoids and coumarins from glycyrrhiza uralensis: antibacterial activity against oral pathogens and conversion of isoflavans into isoflavan-quinones during purification.
AB  == phytochemical investigation of a supercritical fluid extract of glycyrrhiza uralensis has led to the isolation of 20 known isoflavonoids and coumarins, and glycycarpan (7), a new pterocarpan. the presence of two isoflavan-quinones, licoriquinone a (8) and licoriquinone b (9), in a fraction subjected to gel filtration on sephadex lh-20 is due to suspected metal-catalyzed oxidative degradation of licoricidin (1) and licorisoflavan a (2). the major compounds in the extract, as well as 8, were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the growth of several major oral pathogens. compounds 1 and 2 showed the most potent antibacterial activities, causing a marked growth inhibition of the cariogenic species streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus at 10 mug/ml and the periodontopathogenic species porphyromonas gingivalis (at 5 mug/ml) and prevotella intermedia (at 5 mug/ml for 1 and 2.5 mug/ml for 2). only 1 moderately inhibited growth of fusobacterium nucleatum at the highest concentration tested (10 mug/ml).

TI  == community-based interference against integration of pseudomonas aeruginosa into human salivary microbial biofilm.
AB  == as part of the human gastrointestinal tract, the oral cavity represents a complex biological system and harbors diverse bacterial species. unlike the gut microbiota, which is often considered a health asset, studies of the oral commensal microbiota have been largely limited to their implication in oral conditions such as dental caries and periodontal disease. less emphasis has been  given to their potential beneficial roles, especially the protective effects against oral colonization by foreign or pathogenic bacteria. in this study, we used salivary microbiota derived from healthy human subjects to investigate protective effects against colonization and integration of pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic bacterial pathogen, into developing or pre-formed salivary biofilms. when co-cultivated in saliva medium, p. aeruginosa persisted in the planktonic phase, but failed to integrate into the salivary microbial community during biofilm formation. furthermore, in saliva medium supplemented with sucrose, the oral microbiota inhibited the growth of p. aeruginosa by producing lactic acid. more interestingly, while pre-formed salivary biofilms were able to prevent p. aeruginosa colonization, the same biofilms recovered from mild chlorhexidine gluconate treatment displayed a shift in microbial composition and showed a drastic reduction in protection. our study indicates that normal oral communities with balanced microbial compositions could be important in effectively preventing the integration of foreign or pathogenic bacterial species, such as p. aeruginosa.

TI  == effect of a self-etching adhesive containing an antibacterial monomer on clinical periodontal parameters and subgingival microbiologic composition in orthodontic patients.
AB  == introduction: the aims of this study were to evaluate the effect of a self-etching adhesive system containing an antibacterial monomer on periodontal health and subgingival microbiologic composition in orthodontic patients and to compare it with a conventional adhesive system. methods: a split-mouth design was chosen, and 15 patients were included in the study. brackets in contralateral quadrants were bonded with either a conventional adhesive system (control) or a self-etching adhesive system that contained an antibacterial monomer. clinical periodontal parameters including plaque index, gingival index, probing depths, and bleeding on probing were determined. subgingival plaque samples were collected before bracket placement (t0) and at the 6-month follow-up (t1). the real-time taqman polymerase chain reaction assay was used to determine the subgingival counts of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and campylobacter rectus. for clinical periodontal parameters, analysis of covariance (ancova) and, for bacterial counts, wilcoxon tests were used for statistical comparisons at the p <0.05 level. results: clinical periodontal parameters were not changed, and they were not different between the  groups from t0 to t1. t forsythensis and f nucleatum increased during the treatment period in both groups (p <0.05). the majority of the bacteria were t nucleatum at t0 and t1 in both groups. changes in bacterial load from t0 to t1 were not different between groups except for t forsythensis and f nucleatum (p <0.05). conclusions: the use of an antibacterial monomer did not have an additional positive effect on clinical periodontal parameters. when used in bonding orthodontic brackets, the antibacterial monomer failed to reduce periodontopathogenic bacteria when compared with the conventional adhesive system during a 6-month treatment period.

TI  == antibacterial activity of povidone-iodine against an artificial biofilm of porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == objective: to investigate the antibacterial activity of povidone-iodine (pvp-i) on an artificial dual species biofilm of periodontal pathogens. design: porphyromonas gingivalis or fusobacterium nucleatum grown in broth culture was inoculated on polycarbonate membrane (pcm) tissue culture inserts. after incubation for 72 h, pvp-i solutions were applied to the biofilm for the time period ranging from 0.5 to 5 min. after addition of a deactivator, each pcm was removed and the biofilm on the pcm was serially diluted and plated on blood agar  plates and cultured anaerobically for 7 days. then viable bacteria were enumerated. results: in the dual species biofilm model, f. nucleatum showed an approximately 200-fold increase in viable counts when compared with mono-microbial biofilm. in dual species biofilm, pvp-i with concentration equal to or greater than 2% was required to significantly reduce p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum. when the contact time of pvp-i was increased to 1 min or greater, no difference in antibacterial activity of pvp-i was observed in any concentration.  conclusion: these results suggest that 30s application of 2% pvp-i would be effective in suppressing both p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum in dual-species biofilm, and this provides clinical implication for the control of subgingival biofilm.

TI  == colonisation of the oral cavity by periodontopathic bacteria in complete denture  wearers.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to investigate colonisation by periodontopathic bacteria and the sites of colonisation in elderly upper and lower complete denture wearers. we also investigated the relationship between level of oral hygiene and colonisation by periodontopathic bacteria. materials and methods: forty edentulous and 37 dentate volunteers participated in this study. samples were collected from whole saliva, and levels of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia and fusobacterium nucleatum were determined by pcr invader technology. detection of these species on oral mucosal and denture surfaces was performed by pcr. fisher's exact test was used for the statistical analysis. cluster analysis was employed to investigate trends in the periodontopathic bacteria flora in each sampling area. results: detection rates of periodontopathic bacteria in whole saliva were lower under edentulous conditions than under dentulous conditions, except for a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum (p < 0.01). detection rate of f. nucleatum was the highest in all areas. a positive correlation was observed between dna quantification of p. gingivalis and number of candida species in saliva. cluster analysis of the test  species identified two clusters. tongue-coating status was associated with the detection rate of all periodontopathic bacteria investigated, and denture plaque  status was associated with the detection rate of t. denticola and f. nucleatum. conclusion: results indicate the presence of periodontopathic bacteria under edentulous conditions and that the status of oral hygiene of the mucosal or denture surfaces affects colonisation by t. denticola and f. nucleatum.

TI  == levels of periodontal pathogens in neonatal gastric aspirates and possible maternal sites of origin.
AB  == maternal periodontal infection has been recognized as a risk factor for preterm and low birthweight infants. it is suspected that pathogens causing periodontal disease may translocate to the amniotic cavity and so contribute to triggering an adverse pregnancy outcome. this study aimed to determine levels and proportions of periodontal bacteria in neonatal gastric aspirates obtained from complicated pregnancies and the respective maternal oral and vaginal samples using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction approach, and also to determine the origin of the neonate's bacteria by sequence comparisons between the three sites. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and tannerella forsythia were not observed  in the neonates or in the women's vaginas. interestingly, porphyromonas gingivalis was identified in the neonates in two samples (2.98e+02 and 1.75e+02 cells ml(-1)) and in association with fusobacterium nucleatum, which was observed at high prevalence (10%) and at high levels reaching up to 2.32e+03 cells ml(-1). although f. nucleatum was also present in the vaginal samples, the results demonstrated that the neonatal strains were more likely to originate from the mother's oral cavity than to be vaginal strains.

TI  == detection of odoriferous subgingival and tongue microbiota in diabetic and nondiabetic patients with oral malodor using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background: halitosis has been correlated with the concentration of volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) produced in the oral cavity by metabolic activity of bacteria colonizing the periodontal pockets and the dorsum of the tongue. it has  been assumed that there is a relationship between periodontal disease and diabetes mellitus. objectives: the aim of the study was to assess the malodor using the organoleptic method and tanita device; to quantify odoriferous microorganisms of subgingival plaque and tongue coating, such as p. gingivalis (pg), t. forsythia (tf), and f. nucleatum (fn) using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) in nondiabetic and diabetic chronic periodontitis patients. patients and methods: thirty chronic periodontitis patients (with and without diabetes) with 5-7 mm pocket depth, radiographic evidence of bone loss, and presence of oral malodor participated in this study. subjective assessment of mouth air was done organoleptically and by using a portable sulfide monitor. tongue coating was also assessed. results: the scores of plaque index, gingival index, gingival bleeding  index, vsc levels, and tongue coating between the nondiabetic and diabetic patients were not significant (p>0.5). in nondiabetic patients, fn was found to be significantly (p<0.5) more in tongue samples, whereas pg and tf have not shown significant values (p>0.5). in diabetic patients, fn and tf have shown significant (p<0.5) an increase in subgingival and tongue samples, respectively,  whereas pg has not shown significant difference between subgingival and tongue samples. interpretation and conclusion: the results confirm that there is no difference in clinical parameters between nondiabetic and diabetic periodontitis  patients, but the odoriferous microbial profiles in tongue samples of diabetic patients were found to be high. however, there is a weak positive correlation between vsc levels, clinical parameters, and odoriferous microbial profiles.

TI  == comparative evaluation of two structurally related flavonoids, isoliquiritigenin  and liquiritigenin, for their oral infection therapeutic potential.
AB  == isoliquiritigenin (1) and liquiritigenin (2) are structurally related flavonoids  found in a variety of plants. the purpose of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of biological properties of these compounds in regard to their therapeutic potential for oral infections. compound 1 demonstrated significant antibacterial activity against three major periodontopathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia. in  contrast, 2 exerted less pronounced effects on the above bacterial species. neither compound was effective against cariogenic bacteria (streptococcus mutans  and streptococcus sobrinus). furthermore, 1 exhibited a stronger inhibitory activity than 2 toward p. gingivalis collagenase and human matrix metalloproteinase 9. finally, the capacity of 1 to attenuate the inflammatory response of macrophages induced by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide (lps) was much higher when compared to 2. the activation of transcriptional factors nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab) p65 and activator protein-1 (ap-1) associated with the lps-induced inflammatory response in macrophages was inhibited strongly by 1, but less affected by 2.

TI  == microbiological aspects of human mandibular subperiosteal dental implants.
AB  == clinical, microbiological, and biochemical features of human mandibular subperiosteal dental implants exhibiting peri-implantitis were compared with those experiencing long-term peri-implant health. after evaluation of clinical parameters, submucosal plaque samples were obtained from permucosal implant abutment posts exhibiting probing depths >/=5 mm and bleeding on probing in subjects with peri-implantitis (n = 3) and from posts with peri-implant health in subjects with long-term subperiosteal implant health (n = 8). the microbial specimens were transported in vmga iii and plated onto enriched brucella blood agar and hammond's selective medium with anaerobic incubation, and onto selective tsbv with 5% co2 incubation. total anaerobic viable counts and selected bacterial species were identified using established phenotypic methods and criteria. in vitro resistance to doxycycline (2 mug/ml), amoxicillin (2 mug/ml), or metronidazole (4 mug/ml) was recorded per subject when bacterial pathogen growth  was noted on antibiotic-supplemented isolation plates. interleukin (il)-1beta levels were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in peri-implant crevicular fluid samples from 5 study subjects. significantly higher plaque index scores, higher total anaerobic viable counts, more red complex species, and lower proportions of gram-positive facultative viridans streptococci and actinomyces species were detected on peri-implantitis-affected subperiosteal implants as compared with subperiosteal implants with long-term peri-implant health. no in vitro resistance to the 3 test antibiotic breakpoint concentrations studied was found, except a fusobacterium nucleatum strain resistant to doxycycline at 2 mug/ml from 1 peri-implantitis subject. subperiosteal implants with peri-implantitis tended to yield higher peri-implant crevicular fluid il-1beta levels. the level of peri-implant supramucosal plaque control and the composition of the peri-implant submucosal microbiome may be important determinants of the long-term clinical status of mandibular subperiosteal dental implants.

TI  == efficacy of taurolidine against periodontopathic species--an in vitro study.
AB  == the antimicrobial effect of taurolidine was tested against periodontopathic species in comparison to chlorhexidine digluconate in the presence or absence of  serum. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic), microbiocidal concentrations (mbc), as well as killing were determined against 32 different microbial strains  including 3 porphyromonas gingivalis, 3 aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and 15 potentially superinfecting species with and without 25% v/v human serum. the mic(50) of taurolidine against the tested microbial strains was 0.025% and the mic(90) 0.05%. the respective values for the mbcs were 0.05% and 0.1%. addition of 25% serum (heat-inactivated) did not change the mic and mbc values of taurolidine. in contrast, mics and mbcs of chlorhexidine (chx) increased by two steps after addition of serum. taurolidine killed microorganisms in a concentration and time-dependent manner, the killing rate of 1.6% taurolidine was 99.08% +/- 2.27% in mean after 2 h. again, killing activity of taurolidine was not affected if serum was added, whereas addition of inactivated serum clearly reduced the killing rate of all selected bacterial strains by chx. therefore, taurolidine possesses antimicrobial properties which are not reduced in the presence of serum as a main component in gingival crevicular fluid and wound fluid. taurolidine may have potential as an antimicrobial agent in non-surgical and surgical periodontal treatment.

TI  == garlic allicin as a potential agent for controlling oral pathogens.
AB  == garlic has been used medicinally throughout human history. allicin is considered  the most therapeutic constituent of garlic. this study tested the antimicrobial activity of garlic allicin on oral pathogens associated with dental caries and periodontitis. allicin was found effective against all the tested bacteria. the broth dilution method revealed that planktonic growth of the cariogenic, gram-positive species streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, and actinomyces oris was inhibited by an allicin concentration of 600 mug/ml or higher. planktonic growth  of the tested gram-negative periopathogenic species aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum was inhibited by a minimum allicin concentration of 300 mug/ml. porphyromonas gingivalis, an anaerobic, gram-negative pathogen and the bacterium most associated with chronic periodontitis, demonstrated the lowest sensitivity to allicin (2,400 mug/ml). gel zymography and the synthetic chromogenic substrate n(alpha)-benzoyl-l-arginine 4-nitroanilide hydrochloride demonstrated that allicin inhibits the proteases of  p. gingivalis, including the arginine and lysine gingipains known as major virulence factors of this organism. a gingipain-inactivated mutant demonstrated high sensitivity to allicin (<300 mug/ml), revealing that gingipains confer resistance to allicin. live/dead staining followed by analysis with confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that allicin was bactericidal to s. mutans grown in mature biofilms. however, this bactericidal effect was reduced as biofilm depth increased. in conclusion, these results support the traditional medicinal use of garlic and suggest the use of allicin for alleviating dental diseases.

TI  == interaction of oral bacteria with gingival epithelial cell multilayers.
AB  == primary gingival epithelial cells were cultured in multilayers as a model for the study of interactions with oral bacteria associated with health and periodontal disease. multilayers maintained at an air-liquid interface in low-calcium medium  displayed differentiation and cytokeratin properties characteristic of junctional epithelium. multilayers were infected with fluorescently labeled porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum or streptococcus gordonii, and bacterial association was determined by confocal microscopy and quantitative image analysis. porphyromonas gingivalis invaded intracellularly and spread from cell to cell; a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum remained extracellular and showed intercellular movement through the multilayer; whereas s. gordonii remained extracellular and predominantly associated with the superficial cell layer. none of the bacterial species disrupted barrier function as measured by transepithelial electrical resistance.  p. gingivalis did not elicit secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. however, a.  actinomycetemcomitans and s. gordonii induced interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), il-6 and il-8 secretion; and f. nucleatum stimulated production of il-1beta and tnf-alpha. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and s. gordonii, but not p. gingivalis, increased levels of apoptosis after 24 h infection. the results indicate that the organisms with pathogenic potential were able to traverse the epithelium, whereas the commensal bacteria did not. in addition, distinct host responses characterized the interaction between the junctional epithelium and oral bacteria.

TI  == inhibitory effect of lactobacillus reuteri on periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria.
AB  == the interaction between lactobacillus reuteri, a probiotic bacterium, and oral pathogenic bacteria have not been studied adequately. this study examined the effects of l. reuteri on the proliferation of periodontopathic bacteria including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia, and on the formation of streptococcus mutans biofilms. human-derived l. reuteri strains (kctc 3594 and kctc 3678) and rat-derived l. reuteri kctc 3679 were used. all strains exhibited significant inhibitory effects on the growth of periodontopathic bacteria and the formation of s. mutans biofilms. these antibacterial activities of l. reuteri were attributed to the production of organic acids, hydrogen peroxide, and a bacteriocin-like compound. reuterin, an antimicrobial factor, was produced only by l. reuteri kctc 3594. in addition, l. reuteri inhibited the production of methyl mercaptan by f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. overall, these results suggest that l. reuteri may be useful as a probiotic agent for improving oral health.

AB  == recently, we reported that myrsinoic acid b purified from myrsine seguinii inhibited methyl mercaptan (ch(3)sh) production by fusobacterium nucleatum jcm8532. since hydrogen sulfide (h(2)s) is the main component of physiological halitosis, while ch(3)sh is involved in pathological oral halitosis, the objective of this study is to determine whether myrsinoic acid b inhibits h(2)s production by oral microorganisms. f. nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola were incubated with myrsinoic acid b and a substrate such as  l-cysteine or l-methionine. h(2)s or ch(3)sh concentration in the headspace air,  was determined using a gas chromatograph. the concentration of myrsinoic acid b inhibiting 50% (ic(50)) of h(2)s production by f. nucleatum was 0.142 microg ml(-1), and the ic(50) of p. gingivalis and t. denticola were 2.71 microg ml(-1)  and 28.9 microg ml(-1), respectively. the presence of pyruvate, a by-product of h(2)s production, was determined. the ic(50) values of myrsinoic acid b for pyruvate production were 22.9 microg ml(-1) for f. nucleatum, 87.7 microg ml(-1)  for p. gingivalis and 165 microg ml(-1) for t. denticola. we concluded that myrsinoic acid b inhibited the production of both h(2)s and pyruvate by periodontal pathogens.

TI  == rna-oligonucleotide quantification technique (roqt) for the enumeration of uncultivated bacterial species in subgingival biofilms.
AB  == approximately 35% of the species present in subgingival biofilms are as yet uncultivated, so their role in periodontal pathogenesis is unknown. the aim of the present study was to develop a high throughput method to quantify a wide range of cultivated and uncultivated taxa in subgingival biofilm samples associated with periodontal disease or health. oligonucleotides targeting the 16s ribosomal dna gene were designed, synthesized and labeled with digoxigenin. these probes were hybridized with the total nucleic acids of pure cultures or subgingival biofilm samples. target species included cultivated taxa associated with periodontal health and disease, as well as uncultivated species, such as tm7 sp. ot 346, mitsuokella sp. ot 131 and desulfobulbus sp. ot 041. sensitivity and  specificity of the probes were determined. a universal probe was used to assess total bacterial load. sequences complementary to the probes were used as standards for quantification. chemiluminescent signals were visualized after film exposure or using a ccd camera. in a pilot clinical study, 266 subgingival plaque samples from eight periodontally healthy people and 11 patients with periodontitis were examined. probes were specific and sensitivity reached 10(4) cells. fusobacterium nucleatum ss. polymorphum and actinomyces gerencseriae were  the most abundant cultivated taxa in clinical samples. among uncultivated/unrecognized species, mitsuokella sp. ot 131 and prevotella sp. ot 306 were the most numerous. porphyromonas gingivalis and desulfobulbus sp. ot 041 were only detected in patients with periodontitis. direct hybridization of total  nucleic acids using oligonucleotide probes permitted the quantification of multiple cultivated and uncultivated taxa in mixed species biofilm samples.

TI  == association between periodontal pathogens and risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction.
AB  == background: the direct effect of periodontal pathogens on atherosclerotic plaque  development has been suggested as a potential mechanism for the observed association between periodontal disease and coronary heart disease, but few studies have tested this theory. objectives: (i) to assess the association of periodontal pathogens in periodontal pockets with the risk of myocardial infarction (mi) and (ii) to assess whether an increase in the number of periodontal bacterial species increases the risk of mi. methods: a total of 313 cases and 747 controls, consisting of caucasian men and women from western new york, aged 35 to 69 years, were recruited for this study. the presence of microorganisms was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, using species-specific polyclonal and monoclonal serodiagnostic reagents. the presence  of six periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythensis (tf), prevotella intermedia (pi), campylobacter recta (cr), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), and eubacterium saburreum (es), and their co-occurrence (0-6) was compared with the odds of having myocardial infarction. results: univariate analyses revealed a higher percentage of the presence of each bacterium in cases compared to controls. in multivariate analyses, only tf and pi were statistically associated with an increase in the odds of having mi [odds ratio or=1.62; 95% ci (1.18-2.22); and 1.40; 95% (1.02-1.92), respectively] after adjusting for age, gender, education, cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, and total pack-years of cigarette smoking. an increase in the number of different periodontal bacteria in pockets was also found to increase the odds of mi [adjusted or=1.14; 95% ci (1.03-1.26)]. participants who had three species or more of periodontal pathogens had about 2-fold increase in odds of having nonfatal mi than those who did not have any type of bacterial species [or=2.01 (1.31-3.08)]. conclusion: the presence of periodontal pathogens, specifically tf  or pi, and an increase in total burden of periodontal pathogenic species were both associated with increased odds of having mi. however, further studies are needed to better assess any causal relationship, as well as the biological mechanisms underlying this association.

TI  == short- and medium-chain fatty acids exhibit antimicrobial activity for oral microorganisms.
AB  == objectives: this study assessed the antibacterial activity of short-, medium-, and long-chain fatty acids against various oral microorganisms. methods: the short-chain fatty acids [formic acid (c1), acetic acid (c2), propionic acid (c3), butyric acid (c4), isobutyric acid (c4), isovaleric acid (c5), hexanoic acid (c6)], medium-chain fatty acids [octanoic acid (c8), capric acid (c10), lauric acid (12)], and long-chain fatty acids [myristic acid (c14), palmitic acid (c16)], were investigated for antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus sanguis, candida albicans, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. results: the data demonstrated that the fatty acids exhibited patterns of inhibition against oral bacteria with some specificity that appeared  related more to the bacterial species that the general structural characteristics of the microorganism. as a group the fatty acids were much less effective against c. albicans than the oral bacteria, with effectiveness limited to hexanoic, octanoic, and lauric acids. formic acid, capric, and lauric acids were broadly inhibitory for the bacteria. interestingly, fatty acids that are produced at metabolic end-products by a number of these bacteria, were specifically inactive  against the producing species, whilst substantially inhibiting the growth of other oral microorganisms. conclusions: the results indicate that the antimicrobial activity of short-chain fatty acids (scfas), medium-chain fatty acids (mcfas), long-chain fatty acids (lcfas) could influence the microbial ecology in the oral cavity via at least 2 potential pathways. first, the agents delivered exogenously as therapeutic adjuncts could be packaged to enhance a microbial-regulatory environment in the subgingival sulcus. second, it would be the intrinsic nature of these fatty acid inhibitors in contributing to the characteristics of the microbial biofilms, their evolution, and emergence of species within the biofilms. further studies on these functions are required to better understand the nature of these potential microbial interactions in the biofilms.

TI  == effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic species--an in vitro study.
AB  == the in vitro study was aimed to determine the effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic microorganisms. ozone was generated for 6 s-2 x 24 s (corresponding to 0.56 mg-2 x 2.24 mg of ozone) against 23 mainly anaerobic periodontopathogenic species. agar diffusion test was used as a screening method. then, the killing activity was tested in a serum-free environment and with 25% v/v inactivated serum. further, the effect of ozone on bactericidal activity of native serum was analyzed against fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. agar diffusion test showed a high efficacy of ozone against microorganisms, especially against porphyromonas gingivalis. this result was confirmed by the killing tests; most of the strains in a concentration of 10(5) were completely eliminated after twofold 18-s application of ozone. only four of the six potentially "superinfecting" species (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, candida albicans) survived in part. addition of heat-inactivated serum reduced the killing rate of ozone by 78% after 6-s and by 47% after twofold 18-s exposures; no strain was completely eradicated after any application of ozone. the bactericidal effect of native serum was enhanced after application of ozone; no effect was visible on the included a. actinomycetemcomitans strain which was found to be completely resistant to the bactericidal action of serum. in conclusion, (a) ozone has a strong antibacterial activity against putative periodontopathogenic microorganisms, and (b) the bactericidal effect is reduced in the presence of serum. ozone may have potential as an adjunctive application to mechanical treatment in periodontitis patients.

TI  == structure, viability and bacterial kinetics of an in vitro biofilm model using six bacteria from the subgingival microbiota.
AB  == background and objective: there are few in vitro models available in the scientific literature for study of the structure, formation and development of the subgingival biofilm. the purpose of this study was to develop and validate an in vitro biofilm model, using representative selected bacteria from the subgingival microbiota. material and methods: six standard reference strains were used to develop biofilms over sterile ceramic calcium hydroxyapatite discs coated with saliva within the wells of presterilized polystyrene tissue culture plates.  the selected species represent initial (streptococcus oralis and actinomyces naeslundii), early (veillonella parvula), secondary (fusobacterium nucleatum) and late colonizers (porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). the structure of the biofilm obtained was studied using a vital fluorescence technique in conjunction with confocal laser scanning microscopy. the biofilm bacterial kinetics were studied by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. results: after 12 h, initial and early colonizers were the first microorganisms detected adhering to the calcium hydroxyapatite discs. the intermediate colonizer f. nucleatum was not detected in the model until 24 h of incubation. late colonizers a. actinomycetemcomitans and  p. gingivalis could be measured inside the biofilm after 48 h. the biofilm reached its steady state between 72 and 96 h after inoculation, with bacterial vitality increasing from the hydroxyapatite surface to the central part of the biofilm. conclusion: an in vitro biofilm model was developed and validated, demonstrating a pattern of bacterial colonization and maturation similar to the in vivo development of the subgingival biofilm.

TI  == salivary infectious agents and periodontal disease status.
AB  == background and objectives: the potential of salivary microorganisms to diagnose periodontal disease and to guide periodontal treatment is a research topic of current interest. this study aimed to determine whether the salivary counts of periodontopathic microbes correlated with the periodontal pocket counts of the same infectious agents, and whether the salivary counts of the test infectious agents could distinguish among individuals with periodontal health and various types of periodontal disease. material and methods: the study included 150 systemically healthy adults, of whom 37 were periodontally healthy, 31 had gingivitis, 46 had chronic periodontitis and 36 had aggressive periodontitis. each study subject contributed microbial samples from the two deepest periodontal pockets of the dentition and from whole saliva. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and epstein-barr virus were identified using the taqman real-time pcr methodology. statistical analysis was performed using the mann-whitney u-test and the receiver operating characteristic statistics. results: c. rectus, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and t. forsythia occurred with significantly higher copy-counts in salivary samples from patients with gingivitis, chronic periodontitis and aggressive periodontitis than from periodontally healthy individuals. a. actinomycetemcomitans only showed higher salivary copy-counts in  subjects with aggressive periodontitis compared with subjects with healthy periodontium, and the salivary copy-counts of epstein-barr virus did not reveal any significant difference among the four subject groups studied. the diagnostic  sensitivity for periodontitis was 89.19 for p. gingivalis and for t. forsythia and 86.49 for p. intermedia, with specificities ranging from 83.78 to 94.59. the  optimal copy-counts per ml saliva for identifying periodontitis were 40,000 for p. gingivalis, 700,000 for t. forsythia and 910,000 for p. intermedia. conclusion: salivary copy-counts of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and p. intermedia appear to have the potential to identify the presence of periodontitis, whereas the salivary level of the other test infectious agents may possess little or no diagnostic utility. longitudinal studies are warranted to determine the ability of salivary copy-counts of major periodontopathic bacteria to predict future periodontal breakdown.

TI  == epigenetic regulation of human beta-defensin 2 and cc chemokine ligand 20 expression in gingival epithelial cells in response to oral bacteria.
AB  == gingival epithelia utilize multiple signaling pathways to regulate innate immune  responses to various oral bacteria, but little is understood about how these bacteria alter epithelial epigenetic status. in this study we report that dna methyltransferase (dnmt1) and histone deacetylase expression were decreased in gingival epithelial cells treated with oral pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis and nonpathogen fusobacterium nucleatum. pretreatment with trichostatin a and sodium  butyrate, which increase acetylation of chromatin histones, significantly enhanced the gene expression of antimicrobial proteins human beta-defensin 2 (hbd2) and cc chemokine ligand 20 (ccl20) in response to both bacterial challenges. pretreatment with dnmt inhibitor 5'-azacytidine increased hbd2 and ccl20 expression in response to f. nucleatum, but not to p. gingivalis. furthermore, we observed a differential pattern of protein levels of h3k4me3, which has been associated with chromatin remodeling and activation of gene transcription, in response to p. gingivalis vs. f. nucleatum. this study provides a new insight into the bacteria-specific innate immune responses via epigenetic regulation.

TI  == killing of anaerobic pathogens by predatory bacteria.
AB  == recently, the predation of bdellovibrio bacteriovorus on a periodontal pathogen has been described. the current study explores the potential antimicrobial activity of a range of predatory bacteria against key periodontal pathogens. a number of representatives from the bdellovibrio, bacteriovorax and peredibacter lineages (called 'balos') were tested for their activity towards a group of key periodontal pathogens and an optimal multiplicity of infection was established. as the oral cavity contains a wide variety of bacteria that are not preyed upon,  it was investigated if they can have an effect on the predation efficiency of balos. it was concluded that a number of important variables involved in bacterial predation are found to be compatible with the composition of the oral microbiota. this finding makes the case for continued study of the potential for  balos to combat periodontal pathogens.

TI  == predation of oral pathogens by bdellovibrio bacteriovorus 109j.
AB  == periodontal diseases are multifactorial infections elicited by a complex of primarily gram-negative bacteria that interact with host tissues and lead to the  destruction of the periodontal structures. bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a gram-negative bacterium that preys upon other gram-negative bacteria. it was previously shown that b. bacteriovorus has an ability to attack and remove surface-attached bacteria or biofilms. in this study, we examined the host specificity of b. bacteriovorus strain 109j and its ability to prey on oral pathogens associated with periodontitis, including; aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. we further demonstrated that b. bacteriovorus 109j has an ability to remove biofilms of ei.  corrodens as well as biofilms composed of a. actinomycetemcomitans. bdellovibrio  bacteriovorus was able to remove a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilms developed on hydroxyapatite surfaces and in the presence of saliva, as well as to detach metabolically inactive biofilms. experiments aimed at enhancing the biofilm removal aptitude of b. bacteriovorus with the aid of extracellular-polymeric-substance-degrading enzymes demonstrated that proteinase-k inhibits predation. however, treating a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilms with dspb, a poly-n-acetylglucosamine (pga) -hydrolysing enzyme, increased biofilm removal. increased biofilm removal was also recorded when a. actinomycetemcomitans pga-defective mutants were used as host cells, suggesting that pga degradation could enhance the removal of a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilm by b. bacteriovorus.

AB  == objective: the photodynamic therapy (pdt) is an alternative method to suppress oral pathogens by the activation of a photosensitizer with laser light. the aim of this study was to investigate the phototoxic effect of three ruthenium-based photosensitizers on fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis. methods: in this in vitro study f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis were incubated with three photosensitizers: (i) a hydrophobic tris-(4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline)-ruthenium(ii)-dication (rd3), (ii) a hydrophilic tris-[(1,10-phenanthroline-4,7-diyl)-bis-(benzenesulfonato)]-ruthenate tetra-anion (rsd3) and (iii) a lower hydrophilic tris-(2,2'-bipyridine)-ruthenium(ii) dication (rby). the subsequent irradiation was done with blue-band halogen light (450-485nm) for 20s using a conventional polymerizer. control samples consisted of bacterial cell suspension irradiated and non-irradiated in the absence of photosensitizer or incubated with the photosensitizer without irradiation. bacterial inactivation was determined by the numbers of colony-forming units (cfu/ml) after anaerobic cultivation. results: the rd3 photosensitizer reduced the viability of f. nucleatum by 4-log10 and of p. gingivalis completely after irradiation for 20s. the viability loss correlated significantly with the concentration of the rd3 photosensitizer and reached a peak at a concentration of 12.5mum (p<0.05). the rsd3 and rby photosensitizers had distinctly lower phototoxic effects in comparison to rd3. conclusion: the rd3 photosensitizer showed a phototoxic effect on f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. the results suggest that the application of the rd3 photosensitizer under visible light may be helpful as an adjunct treatment approach to the inactivation of periodontopathogenic bacteria.

TI  == oxygen tension modulates the cytokine response of oral epithelium to periodontal  bacteria.
AB  == background: there is an inverse relationship between pocket depth and pocket oxygen tension with deep pockets being associated with anaerobic bacteria. however, little is known about how the host tissues respond to bacteria under differing oxygen tensions within the periodontal pocket. aim: to investigate the  effect of different oxygen tensions upon nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappab) activation and the inflammatory cytokine response of oral epithelial cells when exposed to nine species of oral bacteria. materials and methods: h400 oral epithelial cells were equilibrated at 2%, 10% or 21% oxygen. cells were stimulated with heat-killed oral bacteria at multiplicity of infection 10:1, escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (15 mug/ml) or vehicle control. interleukin-8 (il-8) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and nf-kappab activation was measured by reporter vector or by immunohistochemical analysis. results: tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia elicited the greatest epithelial nf-kappab activation and cytokine responses. an oxygen-tension-dependent trend in cytokine production was observed with the highest il-8 and tnf-alpha production observed at 2% oxygen and lowest at 21% oxygen. conclusions: these data demonstrate a greater pro-inflammatory host response and cell signalling response to bacteria present in more anaerobic conditions, and hypersensitivity of epithelial cells to pro-inflammatory stimuli  at 2% oxygen, which may have implications for disease pathogenesis and/or therapy.

TI  == apical root canal microbiota as determined by reverse-capture checkerboard analysis of cryogenically ground root samples from teeth with apical periodontitis.
AB  == introduction: bacteria located in the apical root canal system potentially participate in the pathogenesis of apical periodontitis. detection and identification of apical bacteria can be compromised because of limitations in conventional sampling and identification procedures. this study identified several bacterial taxa in the apical and middle/coronal segments of primarily infected root canal system by using pulverized root segments and a culture-independent molecular method. methods: seventeen extracted teeth with attached apical periodontitis lesions were sectioned to obtain 2 root fragments (apical and middle/coronal segments). root fragments were cryogenically ground, and dna was extracted from samples. after multiple displacement amplification, dna from samples was used as template in a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay targeting 28 bacterial taxa. results: bacterial dna was detected in all samples. the most prevalent taxa in the apical root canal system  were olsenella uli (76.5%), prevotella baroniae (71%), porphyromonas endodontalis (65%), fusobacterium nucleatum (53%), and tannerella forsythia (47%). o. uli, p.  endodontalis, and propionibacterium acnes were as frequently detected in apical samples as they were in middle/coronal samples. p. baroniae, t. forsythia, and f. nucleatum were found more frequently in the apical part of the canal as compared  with matched coronal segments. streptococcus species were more prevalent in middle/coronal samples. the median and mean of shared bacterial taxa between matched apical and middle/coronal segments were 27% and 41%, respectively. conclusions: several candidate endodontic pathogens were very prevalent in the apical root canal system. the apical microbiota was usually complex and differed  in species composition when compared with the microbiota of middle/coronal samples from the same tooth.

AB  == aim: to assess the potential of using vaccination with porphyromonas gingivalis or fusobacterium nucleatum, in modulating local subcutaneous inflammatory response and alveolar bone loss following coinfection with both bacteria. materials and methods: mice were immunized against either p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum. the cytokine response to mixed infection with p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum was evaluated using the subcutaneous chamber model. the alveolar bone loss induced by oral mixed infection was evaluated by micro-ct using the experimental periodontitis model. serum levels of specific antibodies were determined by elisa. results: vaccination with either bacterium produced a specific humoral response before infection. animals immunized against either bacteria following a mixed infection with p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, showed  decreased tnfalpha (but not il-1beta) levels as compared with non-immunized animals. however, the vaccination did not change the level of mixed infection-induced alveolar bone loss when compared with non-immunized animals. six weeks following the oral mixed infection, specific antibody titres remained high. furthermore, specific antibodies against the non-immunized bacterium were present at high levels. conclusions: while vaccination produced specific antibodies and suppressed the inflammatory response, it failed to prevent or reduce the progression of experimental periodontitis induced by mixed infection with p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum.

TI  == microbiota around teeth and dental implants in periodontally healthy, partially edentulous patients: is pre-implant microbiological testing relevant?
AB  == this study aimed to assess the prevalence of seven periodontal marker pathogens,  before implant placement and 1 yr after loading, in periodontally healthy individuals and to assess the long-term effectiveness of pre-implant reduction of pathogens to below threshold levels. in 93 individuals needing single tooth replacement, pooled subgingival microbiological samples from standard sites were  cultured and analyzed before implant treatment and 1 yr after loading. threshold  levels commonly used in periodontology to predict periodontal breakdown were applied. subjects with levels of pathogens above these thresholds received initial periodontal treatment including systemic antibiotics when indicated. at baseline, 49.5% of periodontally healthy subjects harboured one or more marker pathogens above threshold levels. periodontal treatment reduced the pathogen levels below threshold values in 78.3% of these initially colonized subjects. in  all cases aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were reduced to below threshold. at 1 yr after loading, periodontal pathogens were present above threshold levels in 74.1% of all subjects. it is concluded that in  almost half of periodontal healthy individuals the subgingival biofilm harbours periodontal pathogens above threshold values. long-term effectiveness of pre-implant reduction of the selected marker pathogens appeared limited in our patient population, making pre-implant reduction unpredictive for post-implant levels of these pathogens. thus, considering the applied microbiological criteria, generalized pre-implant microbiological testing is not contributory in  periodontally healthy subjects.

TI  == hiv-1 reactivation induced by the periodontal pathogens fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis involves toll-like receptor 2 [corrected] and 9 activation in monocytes/macrophages.
AB  == although oral coinfections (e.g., periodontal disease) are highly prevalent in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-positive (hiv-1(+)) patients and appear to positively correlate with viral load levels, the potential for oral bacteria to induce hiv-1 reactivation in latently infected cells has received little attention. we showed that hiv-1 long terminal repeat (ltr) promoter activation can be induced by periodontopathogens in monocytes/macrophages; nevertheless, the mechanisms involved in this response remain undetermined. since toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2), tlr4, and tlr9 activation have been involved in hiv-1 recrudescence, we sought to determine the role of these tlrs in hiv-1 reactivation induced by the periodontal pathogens fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis using bf24 monocytes/macrophages stably transfected with the hiv-1 promoter driving chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) expression and thp89gfp cells, a model of hiv-1 latency. we demonstrated that tlr9 activation by f. nucleatum and tlr2 activation by both bacteria appear to be involved in hiv-1  reactivation; however, tlr4 activation had no effect. moreover, the autocrine activity of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) but not interleukin-1beta (il-1beta) produced in response to bacteria could impact viral reactivation. the  transcription factors nf-kappab and sp1 appear to be positively regulating hiv-1  reactivation induced by these oral pathogens. these results suggest that oral gram-negative bacteria (f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis) associated with oral and  systemic chronic inflammatory disorders enhance hiv-1 reactivation in monocytes/macrophages through tlr2 and tlr9 activation in a mechanism that appears to be transcriptionally regulated. increased bacterial growth and emergence of these bacteria or their products accompanying chronic oral inflammatory diseases could be risk modifiers for viral replication, systemic immune activation, and aids progression in hiv-1(+) patients.

AB  == objective: this study is to assess the antibacterial activity of omega-6, -7, -9  (n-6, n-7, n-9) fatty acids against various oral microorganisms. methods: the n-6, n-7, n-9 fatty acids, such as gamma-linoleic acid (gla), linoleic acid (la), arachidonic acid (ara), palmitoleic acid (pa), and oleic acid (oa), their fatty acid ethyl esters, gla-ee, la-ee, ara-ee, pa-ee, oa-ee, and their fatty acid methyl esters, gla-me, la-me, ara-me, pa-me, oa-me, were investigated for antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens streptococcus mutans, candida albicans, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. various concentrations of the fatty acids, their methyl and ethyl esters were tested against various oral pathogens in 96-well plates and blood-agar plate. the plates were incubated anaerobically or aerobically at 37 degrees c for 48h, and the colony forming units (cfu) were determined. results: the data demonstrated that select n-6, n-7, n-9 fatty acids and their esters exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against these oral microorganisms, demonstrating some specificity for individual microbial species. conclusion: the  potential use or the combinations of the n-6, n-7, n-9 fatty acids and/or their esters, provided in a local delivery vehicle to infected sites in the oral cavity, could be considered as an additional therapeutic approach to improving oral health.

TI  == gram-negative periodontal bacteria induce the activation of toll-like receptors 2 and 4, and cytokine production in human periodontal ligament cells.
AB  == background: periodontitis is a bacterially induced chronic inflammatory disease.  toll-like receptors (tlrs), which could recognize microbial pathogens, are important components in the innate and adaptive immune systems. both qualitatively and quantitatively distinct immune responses might result from different bacteria stimulation and the triggering of different tlrs. this study explores the interaction of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) with tlr2 and tlr4. methods: we studied the gene expression changes of tlr2 and tlr4 and cytokine production (interleukin-1beta, -6, -8, -10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) in human periodontal ligament cells (hpdlcs) stimulated with heat-killed bacteria or p. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (lps) in the presence or absence of monoclonal antibodies to tlr2 or tlr4 (anti-tlr2/4 mab). results: both test bacteria and 10  microg/ml p. gingivalis lps treatment increased the gene expression of tlr2 and tlr4 and cytokine production in hpdlcs. in addition, these upregulations could be blocked by anti-tlr2/4 mab. however, the expression of tlr4 mrna in hpdlcs stimulated with 1 microg/ml p. gingivalis lps was not increased. no differences were found in the cytokine production caused by 1 microg/ml p. gingivalis lps treatment in the presence or absence of anti-tlr4 mab. conclusion: these patterns of gene expression and cytokine production indicate that gram-negative periodontal bacteria or their lps might play a role in triggering tlr2 and/or tlr4, and be of importance for the immune responses in periodontitis.

TI  == effects of a composition containing lactoferrin and lactoperoxidase on oral malodor and salivary bacteria: a randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
AB  == we report a clinical trial of the effects of test tablets containing bovine lactoferrin and lactoperoxidase on oral malodor and salivary bacteria. fifteen subjects with volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) in mouth air above the olfactory threshold (h(2)s >1.5 or ch(3)sh >0.5 ng/10 ml) as detected by gas chromatography were enrolled in the trial. either a test or a placebo tablet was ingested twice  at 1-h intervals in two crossover phases. mouth air was monitored for vsc levels  at the baseline before ingestion of a tablet, 10 min after the first ingestion, 1 h (just before the second ingestion), and 2 h after the first ingestion. whole saliva was analyzed at the baseline and at 2 h for bacterial numbers. at 10 min,  the level of ch(3)sh was significantly lower in the test group (median [interquartile range] = 0.28 [0.00-0.68] ng/10 ml) compared to that in the placebo group (0.73 [0.47-1.00] ng/10 ml; p = 0.011). the median concentration of ch(3)sh in the test group was below the olfactory threshold after 10 min until 2  h, whereas the level in the placebo group was above the threshold during the experimental period. no difference in the numbers of salivary bacteria was detected by culturing or quantitative pcr, but terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism detected one fragment with a significantly lower copy number  at 2 h in the test group (mean +/- standard error, 4.89 +/- 0.11 log(10) copies/10 microl) compared to that in the placebo group (5.38 +/- 0.15 log(10) copies/10 microl; p = 0.033). these results indicate a suppressive effect of the  test composition on oral malodor and suggest an influence on oral bacteria.

AB  == aim: to test recolonization of periodontal lesions after full-mouth scaling and root planing (fm-srp) or multiple session-srp (ms-srp) in a randomized clinical trial and whether fm-srp and ms-srp result in different clinical outcomes. materials and methods: thirty-nine subjects were randomly assigned to fm-srp or ms-srp groups. at baseline and after 3 months, probing pocket depth (ppd), plaque index (pli) and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded. at baseline, immediately after treatment, after 1, 2, 7, 14 and 90 days, paper point samples from a single site from the maxillary right quadrant were collected for microbiological analysis of five putative pathogens by polymerase chain reaction. results: fm-srp and ms-srp resulted in significant reductions in ppd, bop and pli and the overall detection frequencies of the five species after 3 months without significant differences between treatments. compared with ms-srp, fm-srp resulted in less recolonization of the five species, significantly for treponema denticola, in the tested sites. conclusion: fm-srp and ms-srp result in overall clinically and microbiologically comparable outcomes where recolonization of periodontal lesions may be better prevented by fm-srp.

TI  == in vitro cytokine responses to periodontal pathogens: generalized aggressive periodontitis is associated with increased il-6 response to porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp) is an inflammatory condition resulting in destruction of tooth-supporting tissues. we examined the production  of il-1beta, il-6, tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, il-12 and il-10 in cultures of peripheral mononuclear cells (mnc) from 10 patients with gagp and 10  controls stimulated with periodontal pathogens or a control antigen, tetanus toxoid (tt) in the presence of autologous serum. the pathogens used were porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum, either as type strains or bacteria isolated from the participants' inherent oral  flora. the p. gingivalis -induced production of il-6 was approximately 2.5-fold higher in patients with gagp than in healthy controls (p < 0.05), while the corresponding tnf-alpha production was non-significantly elevated. il-1beta production induced by p. gingivalis, as all cytokine responses induced by pr. intermedia, f. nucleatum and tt was similar in the two groups. a reduced il-12p70 response to pr. intermedia and f. nucleatum was observed in smokers compared to non-smoking patients (p < 0.02). to assess the role of serum factors in the elevated il-6 response to p. gingivalis, mnc from two donors free of disease were stimulated with this bacterium in the presence of the various patient and control sera. an elevated il-6 and tnf-alpha response was observed in the presence of patient sera (p < 0.01 and p < 0.04, respectively). the data suggest that an exaggerated production of il-6 occurs in gagp, and that pro-inflammatory serum factors play an essential role in the response.

TI  == mixture of periodontopathogenic bacteria influences interaction with kb cells.
AB  == introduction: the purpose of this study was to investigate the adhesion and invasion of periodontopathogenic bacteria in varied mixed infections and the release of interleukins from an epithelial cell line (kb cells). methods: kb cells were co-cultured with porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 and m5-1-2, tannerella forsythia atcc 43037, treponema denticola atcc 35405 and fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586 in single and mixed infections. the numbers of adherent and  internalized bacteria were determined up to 18 h after bacterial exposure. additionally, the mrna expression and concentrations of released interleukin (il)-6 and il-8 were measured. results: all periodontopathogenic bacteria adhered and internalized in different numbers to kb cells, but individually without any evidence of co-aggregation also to f. nucleatum. high levels of epithelial mrna of il-6 and il-8 were detectable after all bacterial challenges. after the mixed  infection of p. gingivalis atcc 33277 and f. nucleatum atcc 25586 the highest levels of released interleukins were found. no il-6 and il-8 were detectable after the mixed infection of p. gingivalis m5-1-2 and f. nucleatum atcc 25586 and the fourfold infection of p. gingivalis atcc 33277, t. denticola atcc 35405, t. forsythia atcc 43037 and f. nucleatum atcc 25586. conclusion: anaerobic periodontopathogenic bacteria promote the release of il-6 and il-8 by epithelial  cells. despite a continuous epithelial expression of il-8 mrna by all bacterial infections these effects are temporary because of the time-dependent degradation  of cytokines by bacterial proteases. mixed infections have a stronger virulence potential than single bacteria. further research is necessary to evaluate the role of mixed infections and biofilms in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

AB  == background: the purpose of this study is to clinically and microbiologically evaluate the effect of photodynamic therapy (pdt) as a full-mouth procedure in fusobacterium nucleatum-infected patients with periodontitis. methods: in the present study, pdt is administered adjuvantly after scaling and root planing (srp) to patients with localized chronic periodontitis (lcp). twenty-four patients, in whom only f. nucleatum was detected by baseline polymerase chain reaction (pcr) after srp, were randomly assigned to pdt and control groups. pdt was carried out once as a full-mouth disinfection in the test group. the control  group was treated with the photosensitizer solution, but without laser irradiation. in all subjects, the clinical parameters plaque index, reddening, bleeding on probing (bop), probing depth (pd), gingival recession, and clinical attachment level (cal) were determined at the baseline examination and at 1, 4, and 12 weeks after pdt. quantitative analysis of the f. nucleatum dna concentration was performed by competitive pcr. all clinical indices were calculated for each test and control subject as were the median and interquartile range of each group. results: in patients with lcp who received pdt treatment, significant reductions in reddening, bop, and mean pd and cal were observed during the observation period and with respect to controls. four and 12 weeks after pdt, the mean pd and cal showed significant differences from baseline values and from those of the control group. in the pdt group, 12 weeks after treatment, the f. nucleatum dna concentration was found to be significantly reduced compared to the baseline level. conclusion: the results of this study show that the adjuvant application of the described pdt method is appropriate to  reduce periodontal inflammatory symptoms and to successfully treat infection with f. nucleatum.

TI  == supernatants from oral epithelial cells and gingival fibroblasts modulate human immunodeficiency virus type 1 promoter activation induced by periodontopathogens  in monocytes/macrophages.
AB  == bacterial and host cell products during coinfections of human immunodeficiency virus type 1-positive (hiv-1(+)) patients regulate hiv-1 recrudescence in latently infected cells (e.g. t cells, monocytes/macrophages), impacting highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart) failure and progression of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. a high frequency of oral opportunistic infections (e.g. periodontitis) in hiv-1(+) patients has been demonstrated; however, their potential to impact hiv-1 exacerbation is unclear. we sought to determine the ability of supernatants derived from oral epithelial cells (okf4) and human gingival fibroblasts (gin-4) challenged with periodontal pathogens, to modulate the hiv-1 promoter activation in monocytes/macrophages. bf24 monocytes/macrophages transfected with the hiv-1 promoter driving the expression  of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) were stimulated with porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, or treponema denticola in the presence of supernatants from okf4 or gin4 cells either unstimulated or previously pulsed with bacteria. cat levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and cytokine production was evaluated by luminex beadlyte assays. okf4 and gin4 supernatants enhanced hiv-1 promoter activation particularly related to f. nucleatum challenge. an additive effect was observed in hiv-1 promoter activation when monocytes/macrophages were simultaneously stimulated with gingival cell supernatants and bacterial extracts. okf4 cells produced higher levels of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf) and interleukins -6 and -8 in response to f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. preincubation of okf4 supernatants with anti-gm-csf reduced the additive effect in periodontopathogen-induced hiv-1 promoter activation. these results suggest that  soluble mediators produced by gingival resident cells in response to periodontopathogens could contribute to hiv-1 promoter activation in monocytes/macrophages, albeit this effect is most notable following direct stimulation of the cells with oral gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == fish oil, enriched in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 pufa), is widely used as a dietary or nutritional supplement with numerous benefits, including as  an anti-inflammatory particularly linked to atherosclerosis. while n-3 pufa have  been suggested to be able to improve oral health through a reduction in inflammation through elevations in these fatty acids in serum and cellular membranes, information is lacking for the possibility that these fatty acids could directly impact the survival and growth of the oral bacteria that trigger the chronic inflammatory responses. the n-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (epa), docosahexaenoic acid (dha) and alpha-linolenic acid (ala), and their fatty acid ethyl esters, alaee, epaee, dhaee were analysed for antibacterial activity against oral pathogens. this study demonstrated a novel bioactivity of the three  major n-3 pufa, epa, dha, and ala, and their ester derivatives. our experimental  data indicated that n-3 pufa and their ester derivatives exhibited strong antibacterial activity against various oral pathogens, including streptococcus mutans, candida albicans, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. this study suggested that n-3 pufa could have a positive therapeutic effect for improving oral health via their antibacterial activities, besides their anti-inflammatory effects.

AB  == zinc has antimicrobial activity and zinc salts including zinc chloride (zncl(2))  have been used for the control of oral malodor. in this study, we hypothesized that pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (pdtc), a zinc ionophore, may enhance antimicrobial efficacy of zncl(2). the bactericidal effectiveness of zncl(2) alone (0.5-8 mm) or in combination with pdtc (1 or 10 microm) was evaluated by in vitro short (1 h) time-killing assays against fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis. only a slight viability decrease was observed with zncl(2) or pdtc alone after 1-h incubation. by contrast, combination of zncl(2) and pdtc could achieve a more than 100-fold viability reduction compared with zncl(2) or pdtc alone in f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. therefore, pdtc greatly  enhanced the bactericidal activity of zncl(2) against the oral malodor-producing  bacteria. these results suggest that use of pdtc may be useful for enhancing bactericidal activity of antimalodor regimens of zinc salts.

TI  == interplay of protease-activated receptors and nod pattern recognition receptors in epithelial innate immune responses to bacteria.
AB  == protease-activated receptors (pars), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (nod) receptors and toll-like receptors (tlrs) play a role in innate immunity, but little is known about interaction between these receptors. the goal of this study was to investigate how silencing one receptor affects the expression of other receptors and downstream innate immune markers in response to bacteria. human gingival epithelial cells (gecs) were transfected with sirna specific for par1 or par2, then stimulated with periopathogen porphyromonas gingivalis, bridging organism between pathogens and non-pathogens fusobacterium nucleatum, or non-pathogen streptococcus gordonii. par1 or par2 knock-down resulted in up-regulated nod1 and nod2 expression with p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum stimulation (p<0.01), as well as enhanced tlr2 and tlr4 expression when cells were stimulated by bacteria that utilize tlr2 or tlr4, respectively. involvement  of pars for induction of cc chemokine ligand 20 (ccl20), a cytokine with antimicrobial properties, was observed following stimulation of the three bacterial species. furthermore, results from multiple cytokine elisa array showed receptors utilized in the induction of various innate immune markers are tailored to individual bacterium tested. our data suggest complex interplay of several receptors is required for appropriate innate immune responses to the different types of bacteria present within the oral cavity and that receptor expression itself is altered depending on which organism the cell encounters.

TI  == vaccination targeting surface foma of fusobacterium nucleatum against bacterial co-aggregation: implication for treatment of periodontal infection and halitosis.
AB  == the mechanical therapy with multiple doses of antibiotics is one of modalities for treatment of periodontal diseases. however, treatments using multiple doses of antibiotics carry risks of generating resistant strains and misbalancing the resident body flora. we present an approach via immunization targeting an outer membrane protein foma of fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum), a central bridging organism in the architecture of oral biofilms. neutralization of foma considerably abrogated the enhancement of bacterial co-aggregation, biofilms and  production of volatile sulfur compounds mediated by an inter-species interaction  of f. nucleatum with porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis). vaccination targeting foma also conferred a protective effect against co-infection-induced gum inflammation. here, we advance a novel infectious mechanism by which f. nucleatum co-opts p. gingivalis to exacerbate gum infections. foma is highlighted as a potential target for development of new therapeutics against periodontal infection and halitosis in humans.

TI  == central role of the early colonizer veillonella sp. in establishing multispecies  biofilm communities with initial, middle, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  == human dental biofilm communities comprise several species, which can interact cooperatively or competitively. bacterial interactions influence biofilm formation, metabolic changes, and physiological function of the community. lactic acid, a common metabolite of oral bacteria, was measured in the flow cell effluent of one-, two- and three-species communities growing on saliva as the sole nutritional source. we investigated single-species and multispecies colonization by using known initial, early, middle, and late colonizers of enamel. fluorescent-antibody staining and image analysis were used to quantify the biomass in saliva-fed flow cells. of six species tested, only the initial colonizer actinomyces oris exhibited significant growth. the initial colonizer streptococcus oralis produced lactic acid but showed no significant growth. the early colonizer veillonella sp. utilized lactic acid in two- and three-species biofilm communities. the biovolumes of all two-species biofilms increased when veillonella sp. was present as one of the partners, indicating that this early colonizer promotes mutualistic community development. all three-species combinations exhibited enhanced growth except one, i.e., a. oris, veillonella sp., and the middle colonizer porphyromonas gingivalis, indicating specificity among three-species communities. further specificity was seen when fusobacterium  nucleatum (a middle colonizer), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a late colonizer), and p. gingivalis did not grow with s. oralis in two-species biofilms, but inclusion of veillonella sp. resulted in growth of all three-species combinations. we propose that commensal veillonellae use lactic acid for growth in saliva and that they communicate metabolically with initial, early, middle, and late colonizers to establish multispecies communities on enamel.

TI  == epithelial cell pro-inflammatory cytokine response differs across dental plaque bacterial species.
AB  == aim: the dental plaque is comprised of numerous bacterial species, which may or may not be pathogenic. human gingival epithelial cells (hgecs) respond to perturbation by various bacteria of the dental plaque by production of different  levels of inflammatory cytokines, which is a putative reflection of their virulence. the aim of the current study was to determine responses in terms of interleukin (il)-1beta, il-6, il-8 and il-10 secretion induced by porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus gordonii in order to gauge their virulence potential. materials and methods: hgecs were challenged with the four bacterial species, live or heat killed, at various multiplicity of infections and the elicited il-1beta, il-6, il-8 and il-10 responses were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: primary hgecs challenged with live p. gingivalis produced high levels of il-1beta, while challenge with live a. actinomycetemcomitans gave high levels of  il-8. the opportunistic pathogen f. nucleatum induces the highest levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, while the commensal s. gordonii is the least stimulatory. conclusion: we conclude that various dental plaque biofilm bacteria  induce different cytokine response profiles in primary hgecs that may reflect their individual virulence or commensal status.

AB  == introduction: this study identified the bacterial taxa enduring endodontic treatment procedures by using a combined 16s ribosomal rna-based reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) and reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization approach. methods: samples were taken from infected canals of 15 teeth with apical periodontitis before treatment (s1), after chemomechanical preparation with naocl as the irrigant (s2), and after interappointment medication with a calcium hydroxide paste (s3). bacterial presence was first screened by a dna-based single pcr assay. rna extracts were subjected to rt-pcr, and the resulting products were surveyed for the presence of 28 targeted taxa by using the checkerboard method. results: bacteria were found in all s1 samples. detectable levels of bacterial ribosomal rna, used as an indicator of viability, were observed in 60% of the cases after chemomechanical preparation and 53% after intracanal medication. the most prevalent taxa in s1 were olsenella uli (67%), pyramidobacter piscolens (60%), streptococcus species (53%), and bacteroidetes clone x083 (53%). streptococcus species (47%), fusobacterium nucleatum (40%), and o. uli (33%) prevailed in s2, whereas streptococcus species (47%), propionibacterium acnes (27%), and o. uli (27%) were the most frequent taxa in s3. conclusions: the present study with a combined molecular approach revealed that bacterial diversity was overall markedly reduced by treatment procedures. although bacterial taxa more frequently identified in post-treatment samples emerge as potential risk factors for persistent disease, this remains to be determined by longitudinal studies.

TI  == transmission of periodontopathic bacteria from natural teeth to implants.
AB  == purpose: prevention of peri-implantitis is essential for the success of implant rehabilitation. infection by periodontopathic bacteria is a major cause of peri-implantitis. the aim of the present study was to identify the source of peri-implant colonization by periodontopathic bacteria. materials and methods: twenty-one patients with implants were enrolled in the study. subgingival plaque  samples from the adjacent, occluding, and contralateral natural teeth were collected prior to second-stage surgery. samples from implant sulci were then obtained 2 weeks later. detection of periodontopathic bacteria was performed by the polymerase chain reaction. results: the detection rates for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and fusobacterium nucleatum in all subgingival samples from natural teeth were similar to that in the peri-implant sulci. multiple logistic regression analysis revealed an association between the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and f. nucleatum in the gingival crevices of adjacent teeth and that of the peri-implant sulcus, but no association for tannerella forsythia. conclusions: the present findings suggest that colonization by a. actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and f. nucleatum at the implant sulcus was affected by these microorganisms in the gingival crevice of adjacent teeth rather than those on occluding and contralateral teeth.

TI  == sonic extracts from a bacterium related to periapical disease activate gelatinase a and inactivate tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases timp-1 and timp-2.
AB  == aim: to examine the effects of sonicated bacterial extracts (sbes) from three related to periapical disease bacteria (porphyromonas gingivalis, p. endodontalis and f. nucleatum) on the activation of matrix metalloproteinase (mmp-2) and the inactivation of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (timp-1 and timp-2). methodology: each sbe was added to cultures of human periodontal ligament (pl) cells or ht1080 cells and their supernatants were analysed by zymography for mmp-2. each sbe was added to pl cell cultures, and the amount of timp-1 was determined by elisa. p. gingivalis sbe was incubated with ht1080 cell culture supernatants, and the amounts of timp-1 and timp-2 were determined by elisa. statistical analysis was performed with the paired student's t-test. results: in  extracts of pl cells that had been incubated in the presence of p. gingivalis sbe, one representing pro-mmp-2 (72 kda) and a band corresponding to the active mmp-2 (66 kda) were observed; but in the other extracts it was not detected. when ht1080 cells were treated with p. gingivalis sbe, the pro-mmps was processed into 86- and 66-kda fragments, but in the other extracts, the processing did not occur when the other sbes were used. when pl cells were incubated with the same sbes, the amount of timp-1 was markedly decreased (p < 0.01), but in the other extracts, it was not. the amounts of both timp-1 and timp-2 were decreased in a dose-dependent manner when ht1080 cell culture supernatant was incubated with p.  gingivalis sbe. conclusions: these findings suggest that p. gingivalis sbe may cause connective tissue to be destroyed, contributing to the process of periapical disease, by activating pro-mmp-2 as well as by inactivating timp-1 and timp-2.

TI  == hydrogen sulfide production from cysteine and homocysteine by periodontal and oral bacteria.
AB  == background: hydrogen sulfide is one of the predominant volatile sulfur compounds  (vscs) produced by oral bacteria. this study developed and evaluated a system for detecting hydrogen sulfide production by oral bacteria. methods: l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase (metase) and beta carbon-sulfur (beta c-s) lyase were used to degrade homocysteine and cysteine, respectively, to produce hydrogen sulfide. enzymatic reactions resulting in hydrogen sulfide production were assayed by reaction with bismuth trichloride, which forms a black precipitate when mixed with hydrogen sulfide. the enzymatic activities of various oral bacteria that result in hydrogen sulfide production and the capacity of bacteria from periodontal sites to form hydrogen sulfide in reaction mixtures containing l-cysteine or dl-homocysteine were assayed. results: with l-cysteine as the substrate, streptococcus anginosus fw73 produced the most  hydrogen sulfide, whereas porphyromonas gingivalis american type culture collection (atcc) 33277 and w83 and fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953 produced approximately 35% of the amount produced by the p. gingivalis strains. finally, the hydrogen sulfide found in subgingival plaque was analyzed. using bismuth trichloride, the hydrogen sulfide produced by oral bacteria was visually detectable as a black precipitate. conclusions: hydrogen sulfide production by oral bacteria was easily analyzed using bismuth trichloride. however, further innovation is required for practical use.

TI  == progression of chronic periodontitis can be predicted by the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola in subgingival plaque.
AB  == introduction: chronic periodontitis is an inflammatory disease of the supporting  tissues of the teeth associated with bacteria. diagnosis is achieved retrospectively by clinical observation of attachment loss. predicting disease progression would allow for targeted preventive therapy. the aim of this study was to monitor disease progression in patients on a maintenance program and determine the levels of specific bacteria in subgingival plaque samples and then  examine the ability of the clinical parameters of disease and levels of specific  bacteria in the plaque samples to predict disease progression. methods: during a  12-month longitudinal study of 41 subjects, 25 sites in 21 subjects experienced disease progression indicated by at least 2 mm of clinical attachment loss. real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia in subgingival plaque samples. results: no clinical parameters were able to predict periodontal disease progression. in sites undergoing imminent periodontal disease progression within  the next 3 months, significant partial correlations were found between p. gingivalis and t. forsythia (r = 0.55, p < 0.001) and t. denticola and t. forsythia (r = 0.43, p = 0.04). the odds of a site undergoing imminent periodontal disease progression increased with increasing levels of p. gingivalis and t. denticola. conclusion: monitoring the proportions of p. gingivalis and t.  denticola in subgingival plaque has the potential to help identify sites at significant risk for progression of periodontitis, which would assist in the targeted treatment of disease.

TI  == photodynamic therapy of persistent pockets in maintenance patients-a clinical study.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the short-term performance of a session of single photodynamic therapy (pdt) and of a conventional ultrasonic debridement (ust) in persistent pockets of maintenance patients. in a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blind clinical study, patients with chronic periodontitis with at least two persistent pockets (>4 mm) were enrolled. they were treated either with ust (n = 29) or pdt (n = 25). clinical and microbiological examinations were performed at baseline and after 3 months. for ust, the mean probing depth was reduced from 5.3 to 4.5 mm (p = <0.001) and for pdt from 5.3 to 4.7 mm (p < 0.001) with no difference between the two treatment modalities. microbial counts were significantly reduced about 30% to 40% immediately after debridement but returned to baseline values a 3 months irrespective of treatment. pdt is not superior to conventional mechanical treatment of persistent pockets, but it may be a meaningful therapeutic alternative; the clinical effects were too minor to draw a definitive conclusion.

TI  == differential ability of periodontopathic bacteria to modulate invasion of human gingival epithelial cells by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == periodontitis is a polymicrobial infection caused by selected gram-negative bacteria including porphyromonas gingivalis. host cell invasion by p. gingivalis  has been proposed as a possible mechanism of pathogenesis in periodontitis. the aim of the present study was to assess the influence of periodontopathogens on p. gingivalis invasion of gingival epithelial cells in polymicrobial infection. p. gingivalis was tested for its ability to invade a human gingival epithelial cell  line ca9-22 in co-infection with periodontopathogens, using an antibiotic protection assay. among the pathogens tested, only fusobacterium nucleatum demonstrated the ability to significantly promote p. gingivalis invasion (p<0.01). this increased invasion was confirmed by confocal scanning laser microscopy utilizing a dual labeling technique. in contrast, co-infection with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans or tannerella forsythia attenuated p. gingivalis invasion. the fusobacterial enhancement of host cell invasion was not  observed in co-incubation with other periodontopathogens tested. these results suggested that complex synergistic or antagonistic physiologic mechanisms are intimately involved in host cell invasion by p. gingivalis in polymicrobial infection.

TI  == mutualistic biofilm communities develop with porphyromonas gingivalis and initial, early, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is present in dental plaque as early as 4 h after tooth  cleaning, but it is also associated with periodontal disease, a late-developing event in the microbial successions that characterize daily plaque development. we report here that p. gingivalis atcc 33277 is remarkable in its ability to interact with a variety of initial, early, middle, and late colonizers growing solely on saliva. integration of p. gingivalis into multispecies communities was  investigated by using two in vitro biofilm models. in flow cells, bacterial growth was quantified using fluorescently conjugated antibodies against each species, and static biofilm growth on saliva-submerged polystyrene pegs was analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr using species-specific primers. p. gingivalis could not grow as a single species or together with initial colonizer  streptococcus oralis but showed mutualistic growth when paired with two other initial colonizers, streptococcus gordonii and actinomyces oris, as well as with  veillonella sp. (early colonizer), fusobacterium nucleatum (middle colonizer), and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (late colonizer). in three-species flow cells, p. gingivalis grew with veillonella sp. and a. actinomycetemcomitans but not with s. oralis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. also, it grew with veillonella sp. and f. nucleatum but not with s. oralis and f. nucleatum, indicating that p.  gingivalis and s. oralis are not compatible. however, p. gingivalis grew in combination with s. gordonii and s. oralis, demonstrating its ability to overcome the incompatibility when cultured with a second initially colonizing species. collectively, these data help explain the observed presence of p. gingivalis at all stages of dental plaque development.

TI  == maternal periodontal disease and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 expression.
AB  == background: this study was conducted to examine the relationship between maternal periodontal disease and plasma angiogenic factor expression of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase (sflt)-1. methods: this was a nested case-control study of 220 women, including 45 healthy women with evidence of active periodontal disease, 98 women without evidence of active periodontal disease, 13 women with fetal exposure to oral pathogens, and 64 women without fetal exposure to oral pathogens. active periodontal disease was defined as the presence of moderate/severe periodontal disease and evidence of periodontal disease progression. fetal exposure to oral pathogens was determined by fetal immunoglobulin m (igm) umbilical cord seropositivity. maternal plasma was collected at <26 weeks of gestation; umbilical cord blood was collected at delivery. sflt-1 was measured with an immunoradiometric assay. demographic and medical data were chart abstracted. maternal variables and sflt-1 concentrations  were compared between cases and controls using the student t and chi(2) tests and analysis of variance. results: the median sflt-1 concentration at the time of enrollment for all women was 2,374 pg/ml (interquartile range [iqr]: 1,504 to 3,194 pg/ml). women with evidence of fetal exposure to oral pathogens had significantly higher sflt-1 concentrations compared to igm-negative fetuses (3,383 pg/ml [iqr: 2,610 to 4,244 pg/ml] versus 2,123 pg/ml [iqr: 1,456 to 3,011  pg/ml]; p = 0.03). conclusion: fetal exposure to oral pathogens was associated with increased plasma concentrations of sflt-1 early in pregnancy.

TI  == the effect of lactoferrin on oral bacterial attachment.
AB  == introduction: lactoferrin (lf), an iron-binding salivary glycoprotein, plays an important role in human innate defense against local mucosal infection. we hypothesized that lf interferes with initial oral bacterial attachment to surfaces by iron sequestration, so inhibiting subsequent biofilm formation. the objective was to investigate the effect of lf on the early stages of single-species and multi-species oral biofilm development. methods: streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis were used in this study. glass disks of a two-track flow cell coated with flowing artificial saliva (0.3 ml/min) with and without lf (100 microg/ml) were used for studying bacterial attachment (3 h, 37 degrees c). attachment was also examined by incubating single or multiple species of test bacteria (10(7) colony-forming units/ml) with lf-coated (20-100 microg/ml) and uncoated glass slides. the effects of beta-lactoglobulin, 2,2'-dipyridyl (25-100 microg/ml), an  iron chelator, and fecl3 on attachment were also examined. results: lf inhibited  the initial attachment of s. gordonii (50.3%, p < 0.05) but not that of f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. however, the attachment of a dual-species biofilm containing s. gordonii (i.e. s. gordonii/f. nucleatum or s. gordonii/p. gingivalis) was significantly reduced (48.7% or 62.1%, respectively, p < 0.05) in the presence of lf. beta-lactoglobulin did not affect the attachment of s. gordonii. in the presence of 100 microm 2,2'-dipyridyl, attachment of s. gordonii was reduced by 53.87%. no reduction in attachment was noted in s. gordonii pretreated with lf (100 microg/ml) and fecl3 (20-200 microm). conclusion: lf suppresses initial attachment of s. gordonii and s. gordonii coaggregates by iron sequestration. this may lead to subsequent inhibition of oral biofilm development.

TI  == oral bacteria induce a differential activation of human immunodeficiency virus-1  promoter in t cells, macrophages and dendritic cells.
AB  == introduction: the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) can integrate into t cells,  macrophages and dendritic cells resulting in a latent infection. reports have also demonstrated that various microbial and host cell factors can trigger hiv reactivation leading to hiv recrudescence, potentially undermining highly active  antiretroviral therapies. methods: this study evaluated the capacity of oral bacteria associated with chronic periodontal infections to stimulate hiv promoter activation in various cell models of hiv latency. results: t cells (1g5) challenged with oral bacteria demonstrated a dose-response of hiv promoter activation with a subset of the bacteria, as well as kinetics that were generally similar irrespective of the stimuli. direct bacterial challenge of the t cells resulted in increased activation of approximately 1.5- to 7-fold over controls. challenge of macrophages (bf24) indicated different kinetics for individual bacteria and resulted in consistent increases in promoter activation of five fold to six fold over basal levels for all bacteria except streptococcus mutans. dendritic cells showed increases in hiv reactivation of 7- to 34-fold specific for individual species of bacteria. conclusion: these results suggested that oral bacteria have the capability to reactivate hiv from latently infected cells, showing a relationship of mature dendritic cells > immature dendritic cells > macrophages > or = t cells. expression of various pattern recognition receptors on these various cell types may provide insight into the primary receptors/signaling pathways used for reactivation by the bacteria.

AB  == background: the aim of the study was to assess the bacterial community structures associated with endodontic infections using terminal restriction fragment length  polymorphism (t-rflp), and to investigate the correlation of whole community profiles with the manifestation of particular clinical features. methods: intraradicular samples were collected from 34 subjects and classified into three  study groups based on the observed clinical symptoms: acute (n = 16), sub-acute (n = 8), and asymptomatic (n = 10). genomic dna was extracted from each sample, submitted to polymerase chain reaction using a fluorescently labeled 16s ribosomal dna forward primer, and digested with two tetrameric endonucleases (hhai and mspi). the terminal restriction fragments (t-rfs) were subsequently discriminated in an automated dna sequencer, and the results were filtered using  a statistics-based criterion. results: totals of 138 (hhai) and 145 (mspi) unique t-rfs were detected (means 13.1 and 11.9) and there was high inter-subject variability in the bacterial assemblages. odds-ratio analysis unveiled the existence of higher order groups of positively associated t-rfs, restating the concept that intricate ecological relationships may take place in the root canal  space. a significantly greater t-rf prevalence was detected in acute cases, suggesting a straight correlation between species richness and spontaneous pain.  conclusion: overall, no t-rflp profile representing a specific bacterial consortium could be associated with the manifestation of symptoms of endodontic origin.

TI  == quantification of periodontal pathogens by paper point sampling from the coronal  and apical aspect of periodontal lesions by real-time pcr.
AB  == the present study compared the recovery of six periodontal pathogens by paper point samples from two different aspects of periodontal lesions by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). twenty patients with untreated chronic periodontitis were randomized into two groups. before subgingival instrumentation and after 10 weeks samples in group a were taken first with a paper point half length (hp) of the probing depth, then with a paper point full length (fp) at the same site. in group b sampling sequence was reversed. analysis by real-time pcr enabled quantification of six bacteria as well as total bacterial count (tbc). statistical analysis included t test, kappa, and spearman's correlations. higher  tbc could be harvested by use of fp than by hp (mean of differences of ln-transformed counts before therapy: -0.791, ci [-1.515, -0.068], sd 0.770, p =  0.034; after therapy: -0.563, ci [-1.151, 0.024], sd 0.625, p = 0.059). the plaque composition regarding total target pathogens was similar for both samples. both, for tbc as well as for single target bacteria a strong positive correlation was found between hp and fp (kappa, spearman correlation: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans 0.807, 0.778; fusobacterium nucleatum 0.573, 0.772; porphyromonas gingivalis 0.733, 0.824; prevotella intermedia 0.480, 0.756; treponema denticola 0.807, 0.814; and tannerella forsythia 0.692, 0.695). the recovery of target pathogens was similar following sampling at various depths of  the periodontal lesion.

TI  == bone microbial contamination influences autogenous grafting in sinus augmentation.
AB  == background: the oral occurrence of putative microbial pathogens in humans has been documented in health and disease. the presence of periodontopathogens in patients with a history of periodontal disease may have a negative impact on bone regeneration. this investigation was conducted to confirm the presence of periodontal pathogens in bone particles harvested intraorally for maxillary sinus augmentation and to assess the clinical and radiographic outcomes 6 to 12 months  after bone augmentation. methods: culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based identification were performed by paper-point sampling of intraorally  harvested bone particles in a group of 12 maintenance patients undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation. radiographs were taken to assess and compare bone healing and volume gain at baseline and at 6 to 12 months after augmentation. results: the presence of periodontal pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans [previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans], prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia [previously t. forsythensis], fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra [previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros], campylobacter rectus, enteric gram-negative rods, and dialister pneumosintes) was identified in 10 of 12 patients (83%) by culture, pcr, or both and was associated with greater bone volume loss at 6 months postaugmentation. the pcr-positive triad, p. gingivalis,  a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. intermedia, was associated with pronounced volume loss of the grafted sinus at 6 months. conclusions: to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to confirm osseous microbial contamination with major periodontopathogens in individuals undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation with a history of periodontitis. the effect on the grafting outcome  translated into bone volume loss in the grafted sinus 6 months postaugmentation.  specific microbial contamination may have an impact on osteogenesis in osseous regeneration.

AB  == aim: to compare polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with subsequent reverse hybridization (micro-ident test) and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization for the identification of 13 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples were taken using paper points and curettes from two sites each with pocket depth <4, 4-6 and >6 mm at baseline and  3 months in 25 periodontitis subjects and two sites in 25 periodontally healthy subjects. samples were analysed for their content of 13 bacterial species using both assays. similarities for each species between techniques were determined using regression analysis. differences between health and periodontitis were determined using the mann-whitney test. results: three hundred and fifty samples  were evaluated using both techniques. regression analysis indicated that 10/13 test species showed significant positive correlations between the counts determined by checkerboard analysis and levels determined by the pcr-based test after adjusting for 13 comparisons. the highest rank correlations of 0.58, 0.49 and 0.46 were seen for treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatum and eubacterium nodatum, respectively (p<0.0001). both tests could distinguish samples from healthy and periodontitis subjects. conclusion: detection patterns of 10/13 test species in subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis and healthy subjects were similar using the two molecular techniques.

TI  == starvation response and growth in serum of fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, prevotella intermedia, and pseudoramibacter alactolyticus.
AB  == the microbiota inhabiting the untreated root canal differ markedly from those found in post-treatment disease, yet there is limited information on the microbial characteristics distinguishing the different infections. we hypothesized that starvation survival is a key microbial property in species selection. this study analyzed starvation-survival behavior over 60 days of species representative of the untreated root canal infection: fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, prevotella intermedia and pseudoramibacter alactolyticus. all species did not survive 1 day in water. in 1% serum, the 4 species could not survive beyond 2-3 weeks. they required a high initial cell density and >or=10% serum to survive the observation period. the results highlight a poor starvation-survival capacity of these 4 species compared with species prevalent in post-treatment infection, which are well equipped to endure starvation and survive in low numbers on minimal serum. these findings point to starvation-survival capacity as a selection factor for microbial participation in post-treatment disease.

AB  == background: our previous studies reported on the obstetric, periodontal, and microbiologic outcomes of women participating in the obstetrics and periodontal therapy (opt) study. this article describes the systemic antibody responses to selected periodontal bacteria in the same patients. methods: serum samples, obtained from pregnant women at baseline (13 to 16 weeks; 6 days of gestation) and 29 to 32 weeks, were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for serum  immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody to aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and treponema denticola. results: at baseline, women who delivered live preterm infants had significantly  lower total serum levels of igg antibody to the panel of periodontal pathogens (p = 0.0018), to p. gingivalis (p = 0.0013), and to f. nucleatum (p = 0.0200) than women who delivered at term. these differences were not significant at 29 to 32 weeks. changes in igg levels between baseline and 29 to 32 weeks were not associated with preterm birth when adjusted for treatment group, clinical center, race, or age. in addition, delivery of low birth weight infants was not associated with levels of antibody at baseline or with antibody changes during pregnancy. conclusions: live preterm birth is associated with decreased levels of igg antibody to periodontal pathogens in women with periodontitis when assessed during the second trimester. changes in igg antibody during pregnancy are not associated with birth outcomes.

TI  == fetal exposure to oral pathogens and subsequent risk for neonatal intensive care  admission.
AB  == background: maternal periodontal infection has been associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. in utero fetal exposure to oral pathogens was also recognized as deleterious to the fetus. the objective of this study was to determine the relationship between fetal exposure to oral pathogens and neonatal  intensive care unit (nicu) admission. methods: this was a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study of maternal oral health and pregnancy outcome. fetal immunoglobulin m against oral pathogens was detected in umbilical cord serum by immunoblot. the presence of at least one oral pathogen-specific antibody was considered seropositivity. the cord level of c-reactive protein was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and categorized as detectable versus undetectable. chi-square and logistic regression analyses were used to determine  the association between cord serum seropositivity or detectable c-reactive protein and nicu admission and length of stay. results: of 650 infants, 45 (6.9%) were admitted to the nicu. the admission rate was higher among seropositive infants compared to seronegative infants (11% versus 5%; p = 0.0019). seropositive infants were also more likely than seronegative infants to stay >3 or >7 days (8% versus 3% and 6% versus 2%; p = 0.004 and 0.003, respectively). adjusting for gestational age, the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for nicu  admission was 2.14 (1.01 to 4.54); for a length of stay >3 or >7 days, it was 2.38 (1.01 to 5.60) and 3.29 (1.13 to 9.58), respectively. the nicu admission rate was not significantly higher for those with detectable versus undetectable umbilical cord serum c-reactive protein (8% versus 6%; p = 0.3). conclusions: in  utero fetal exposure to oral pathogens increases the risk for nicu admission and  the length of stay. interventions that interrupt fetal exposure to oral pathogens may reduce these risks.

TI  == proteomics of porphyromonas gingivalis within a model oral microbial community.
AB  == background: porphyromonas gingivalis is a periodontal pathogen that resides in a  complex multispecies microbial biofilm community known as dental plaque. confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that p. gingivalis can assemble into communities in vitro with streptococcus gordonii and fusobacterium nucleatum, common constituents of dental plaque. whole cell quantitative proteomics, along with mutant construction and analysis, were conducted to investigate how p. gingivalis adapts to this three species community. results: 1156 p. gingivalis proteins were detected qualitatively during comparison of the three species model community with p. gingivalis incubated alone under the same conditions. integration of spectral counting and summed signal intensity analyses of the dataset showed that 403 proteins were down-regulated and 89 proteins up-regulated. the proteomics results were inspected manually and an ontology analysis conducted using david. significant decreases were seen in proteins involved in cell shape and the formation of the cell envelope, as well as thiamine, cobalamin, and pyrimidine synthesis and dna repair. an overall increase was seen in proteins involved in protein synthesis. hmur, a tonb dependent outer membrane receptor, was up-regulated in the community and an hmur deficient mutant was deficient in three species community formation, but was unimpaired in its ability to form mono- or dual-species biofilms. conclusion: collectively, these results indicate that p. gingivalis can assemble into a heterotypic community with f. nucleatum and s. gordonii, and that a community lifestyle provides physiologic support for p. gingivalis. proteins such as hmur, that are up-regulated, can be necessary for community structure.

AB  == objective: bacteria settled in the apical root canal are in a privileged position to inflict damage to the periradicular tissues. therefore, the species identified in this region can be of special relevance for the pathogenesis of apical periodontitis. this study investigated the occurrence and levels of several bacterial taxa in the apical root canal of teeth with apical periodontitis. study design: dna extracts from samples taken from the apical part of the root canal of extracted teeth evincing chronic apical periodontitis lesions served as templates for analysis of the presence and levels of 28 bacterial species/phylotypes using  a 16s ribosomal rna gene-based reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay.  results: bacterial dna was detected in 19 out of 20 samples. detected taxa included pseudoramibacter alactolyticus (32%), bacteroidetes clone x083 (26%), streptococcus species (21%), olsenella uli (10.5%), synergistes clone ba121 (10.5%), fusobacterium nucleatum (10.5%), porphyromonas endodontalis (10.5%), dialister clone bs016 (5%), filifactor alocis (5%), parvimonas micra (5%), and treponema denticola (5%). of these, only bacteroidetes clone x083 and synergistes clone ba121 were found at levels above 10(5). conclusion: occurrence of these bacterial taxa in the apical part of infected root canals indicates their potential pathogenetic role in the etiology of apical periodontitis.

TI  == mouse model of experimental periodontitis induced by porphyromonas gingivalis/fusobacterium nucleatum infection: bone loss and host response.
AB  == aim: to compare the effect of oral infection with porphyromonas gingivalis or fusobacterium nucleatum versus infection with both bacteria on mouse periodontal  tissues, and to characterize the inflammatory response. materials and methods: mice were orally infected with p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum or both. at 42 days post-infection, alveolar bone loss was quantified using micro-computerized tomography. tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin (il)-1beta levels induced by the infection were quantified using the subcutaneous chamber model. results: mice orally infected with f. nucleatum/p. gingivalis exhibited significantly more bone loss compared with that of mono-infected and sham-infected mice. f. nucleatum/p. gingivalis infection also increased the levels of tnf-alpha and il1beta compared with the levels found in the mono-infected groups. conclusions: polymicrobial infection with p. gingivalis/f.  nucleatum aggravates alveolar bone loss and induces a stronger inflammatory response compared with that observed upon infection with either bacterium alone.  the results suggest that oral infection of mice with a mixture of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum may be superior to mono-infection models of experimental periodontitis.

TI  == human cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr virus inhibit oral bacteria-induced macrophage activation and phagocytosis.
AB  == introduction: periodontal disease is an inflammatory condition caused by periodontal microorganisms. viruses such as human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) and epstein-barr virus (ebv) are associated with certain types of periodontal disease, but their roles in promoting the disease are unclear. because both viruses infect human macrophages, cells which play key roles in the clearance of  pathogenic bacteria, it is likely that the viruses alter the functional capacity  of macrophages by inhibiting their defense mechanisms against invading pathogens. methods: macrophages preinfected with hcmv or ebv were evaluated following stimulation by selected oral bacteria. bacteria-induced macrophage activation was assayed by measuring the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) produced in the media, and phagocytic activity was analysed by a phagocytosis assay with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled bacteria. the virus-infected macrophages were also subjected to semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction to measure the expression of toll-like receptor 9, which is involved in the activation of phagocytosis-related pathways. results: both hcmv and ebv significantly diminished the tnf-alpha production typically induced by oral bacteria, inhibited the phagocytic activity of macrophages, and downregulated the expression of toll-like receptor 9. conclusion: infection by hcmv or ebv inhibits the functional ability of macrophages to respond to bacterial challenge, thereby  suggesting their pathogenic role in the development of periodontal disease.

TI  == decreased interleukin-2 responses to fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis in generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: compromised t-cell responses to periodontal pathogens may contribute  to the pathogenesis of generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp). in this study, we attempted to characterize t-helper cell (th1, th2, and th17) responses  in patients with gagp and healthy controls upon stimulation with disease-relevant pathogens. methods: mononuclear cells (mncs) from 10 white patients with gagp and 10 white controls were stimulated with porphyromonas gingivalis american type culture collection (atcc) 33277 (pg), prevotella intermedia atcc 25611, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 49256 (fn), and similar bacteria isolated from the participants' inherent oral flora. tetanus toxoid (tt) was used as control antigen. the resulting production of interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) and interleukin (il)-2, -4, -5 and -17 and the induced proliferation of cd4+ t cells were measured. results: mncs from patients with gagp exhibited decreased il-2 responses to pg and fn. no difference was observed between patients with gagp and controls with regard to cd4+ t-cell proliferation or the production of ifn-gamma  and il-4, -5, and -17, irrespective of whether type strains or bacteria isolated  from the participants' oral cavity were used for stimulation. moreover, similar proliferative and cytokine responses to tt were observed. notably, smoking patients with gagp exhibited significantly lower ifn-gamma responses to the bacteria and to tt than non-smoking patients or controls. conclusions: the decreased il-2 responses of patients with gagp to pg and fn combined with adequate il-2 responses to tt suggest an impaired antigen-specific t-cell reactivity with periodontal pathogens in gagp. the decreased ifn-gamma responses  of smokers within the patient group suggest that smoking may aggravate this impairment.

TI  == the oxyr homologue in tannerella forsythia regulates expression of oxidative stress responses and biofilm formation.
AB  == tannerella forsythia is an anaerobic periodontal pathogen that encounters constant oxidative stress in the human oral cavity due to exposure to air and reactive oxidative species from coexisting dental plaque bacteria as well as leukocytes. in this study, we sought to characterize a t. forsythia orf with close similarity to bacterial oxidative stress response sensor protein oxyr. to analyse the role of this oxyr homologue, a gene deletion mutant was constructed and characterized. aerotolerance, survival after hydrogen peroxide challenge and  transcription levels of known bacterial antioxidant genes were then determined. since an association between oxidative stress and biofilm formation has been observed in bacterial systems, we also investigated the role of the oxyr protein  in biofilm development by t. forsythia. our results showed that aerotolerance, sensitivity to peroxide challenge and the expression of oxidative stress response genes were significantly reduced in the mutant as compared with the wild-type strain. moreover, the results of biofilm analyses showed that, as compared with the wild-type strain, the oxyr mutant showed significantly less autoaggregation and a reduced ability to form mixed biofilms with fusobacterium nucleatum. in conclusion, a gene annotated in the t. forsythia genome as an oxyr homologue was  characterized. our studies showed that the oxyr homologue in t. forsythia constitutively activates antioxidant genes involved in resistance to peroxides as well as oxygen stress (aerotolerance). in addition, the oxyr deletion attenuates  biofilm formation in t. forsythia.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == effect of dietary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on experimental periodontitis in the mouse.
AB  == background and objective: periodontitis is an infective disease caused predominantly by gram-negative anerobes. the host inflammatory response to these  bacteria causes alveolar bone loss, which characterizes periodontitis. omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have recognized anti-inflammatory effects; their oxygenated derivatives are key mediators in reducing inflammation. in this study  we tested the hypothesis that dietary supplementation with tuna fish oil rich in  the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid, would reduce alveolar bone loss in mice inoculated with periodontopathic bacteria. material and methods: adult mice were fed experimental diets containing either 10% tuna oil or sunola oil for 57 d. after 14 d, 35 mice on each diet were inoculated orally with porphyromonas gingivalis, with a mixture of p. gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum, with carboxymethylcellulose or remained untreated. the mice were killed, and soft tissue biopsies from the oral cavity of treated mice were used to determine the polyunsaturated fatty acid concentrations. the maxilla was removed, stained and digitally imaged to assess bone loss around the upper molars. results: n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid levels were significantly higher  in oral soft tissues of mice fed tuna oil compared with the control group. mice fed tuna oil and inoculated with p. gingivalis or with the combination of f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis exhibited 72% and 54% less alveolar bone loss respectively, compared with the treatment control group. conclusion: alveolar bone loss was inversely related to n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid tissue levels.  in conclusion, fish oil dietary supplementation may have potential benefits as a  host modulatory agent in the prevention and/or adjunctive management of periodontitis.

TI  == effect of xylitol on an in vitro model of oral biofilm.
AB  == purpose: the aim of the present study was to examine whether xylitol, at different concentrations, inhibits the formation of an experimental model of oral biofilm. materials and methods: biofilms of six bacterial species (streptococcus  mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, actinomyces viscosus, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum) were prepared on hydroxyapatite (ha) discs according to the zurich biofilm model. xylitol was tested at two concentrations, 1% and 3%. at the end of their designated incubation times, some ha discs were destined for confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and the others were harvested using a sterile surgical instrument. aliquots of harvested biofilms were diluted and plated onto specific  media. after a 48-h anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees c, the colony-forming units (cfus) were counted. results: clsm images showed that only a small amount of isolated bacteria was observed on the surface of ha discs. culture of harvested biofilms showed an inhibition in the growth of different species included in the biofilms. conclusions: xylitol has a clear inhibitory effect on the formation of the experimental biofilms. this study shows that xylitol is not  only efficient in inhibiting the acid production of cariogenic bacteria, but also in preventing the formation of a multispecies biofilm; it confirms the relevance  of the use of this polyol for the prevention of oral diseases caused by dental plaque.

TI  == the microbiota of acute apical abscesses.
AB  == as the breadth of bacterial diversity in the oral cavity has been deciphered by molecular studies, several newly identified species/phylotypes have emerged as potential pathogens. we hypothesized that many of these species/phylotypes could  also be involved with the etiology of endodontic abscesses. abscess aspirates from 42 persons were analyzed for the presence of 81 species/phylotypes by means  of a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. associations between the most frequently detected taxa were calculated. the most prevalent taxa were fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, and porphyromonas endodontalis. other  frequently found taxa included olsenella uli, streptococci, eikenella corrodens,  some as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes (bacteroidetes clone x083 and synergistes clone ba121), and newly named species (prevotella baroniae and dialister invisus). several positive bacterial associations were disclosed. findings not only strengthen the association of many cultivable species with abscesses, but also include some newly named species and uncultivated phylotypes in the set of candidate pathogens associated with this disease.

TI  == periodontal pathogen levels in adolescents before, during, and after fixed orthodontic appliance therapy.
AB  == introduction: this purpose of this study was to document and investigate changes  in periodontal pathogen levels before, during, and after orthodontic treatment in adolescents. methods: dna gene probe analysis was used to quantify the levels of  8 periodontal pathogens before, during, and after treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances in 190 concurrently treated adolescent orthodontic patients. the 8 pathogens examined were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), tannerella forsythia (tf), eikenella corrodens (ec), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), treponema denticola (td), and campylobacter rectus (cr). chi-square tests were used to determine whether the percentages of subjects with high counts significantly changed over time. logistic regression analyses were also performed to derive the relative risk of higher counts of pathogenic bacteria with fixed appliances at the various time intervals studied. results: for 6 (pi, tf, ec, fn, td, cr) of the 8 pathogens, the percentages of subjects with high pathogen counts increased  significantly after 6 months of fixed appliance treatment, but these returned to  pretreatment levels by 12 months of orthodontic treatment. no pathogen level was  significantly higher after 12 months of orthodontic treatment, and orthodontic treatment was found to be significantly protective for half of the pathogens (ec, fn, td, cr) posttreatment. conclusions: orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances does not increase the risk of high levels of these periodontal pathogens.

TI  == enhanced attachment of porphyromonas gingivalis to human fibroblasts mediated by  fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis are often co-isolated from endodontic infection sites. the present study tested the hypothesis that adhesin-mediated reactions might contribute to this phenomenon. f. nucleaum pk1594 and p. gingivalis pk1924 were selectively labeled with fluorochromes and allowed to adhere to human fibroblasts, either each strain alone or sequentially. the number of bacteria of each type adhering to individual fibroblasts was determined. sugar inhibition profile of this adherence was explored. attachment of p. gingivalis to human fibroblasts increased by nearly 10-fold when f. nucleatum was present (p < .001). galactose, lactose, and fucose inhibited this enhanced attachment (p < .001), as well as that of f. nucleatum alone (p < .001). the results suggest that f. nucleatum might be a primary colonizer of the host tissues and serve as mediator for enhanced attachment of p. gingivalis to the host cells. this might explain in part the common co-occurrence of f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis in endodontic mixed infections.

TI  == fusobacterium nucleatum enhances invasion of human gingival epithelial and aortic endothelial cells by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == invasion by porphyromonas gingivalis has been proposed as a possible mechanism of pathogenesis in periodontal and cardiovascular diseases. porphyromonas gingivalis have direct access to the systemic circulation and endothelium in periodontitis patients by transient bacteremia. periodontitis can be described as one of the predominant polymicrobial infections of humans. in the present study, p. gingivalis strains were tested for their ability to invade a human gingival epithelial cell line (ca9-22) and human aortic endothelial cells in coinfection with fusobacterium nucleatum using antibiotic protection assays. coinfection with f. nucleatum resulted in 2-20-fold increase in the invasion of host cells by p. gingivalis strains. the invasive abilities of p. gingivalis strains were significantly greater when incubated with a f. nucleatum clinical isolate (which  possesses strong biofilm-forming ability), than when incubated with a f. nucleatum-type strain. in inhibition assays with metabolic inhibitors, a difference in inhibition profiles was observed between mono- and polymicrobial infections. collectively, our results suggest that f. nucleatum facilitates invasion of host cells by p. gingivalis. investigations of polymicrobial infection of host cells should improve our understanding of the role of p. gingivalis in periodontal infection and proatherogenic mechanisms.

TI  == oral bacteria modulate invasion and induction of apoptosis in hep-2 cells by pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic bacterial pathogen, causing  infections of the respiratory and other organ systems in susceptible hosts. p. aeruginosa infection is initiated by adhesion to and invasion of mucosal epithelial cells. the failure of host defenses to eliminate p. aeruginosa from mucosal surfaces results in p. aeruginosa proliferation, sometimes followed by overt infection and tissue destruction. there is growing evidence that associates poor oral health and respiratory infection. an in vitro model system for bacterial invasion of respiratory epithelial cells was used to investigate the influence of oral bacteria on p. aeruginosa epithelial cell invasion. oral pathogens including porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans increased invasion of p. aeruginosa into hep-2 cells from one- to threefold. in contrast, non-pathogenic oral bacteria such as actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus gordonii showed no significant influence on p. aeruginosa invasion. p. aeruginosa together with oral bacteria stimulated greater cytokine production from hep-2 cells than did p. aeruginosa alone. p. aeruginosa in combination with periodontal pathogens also increased apoptosis of hep-2 cells and induced elevated caspase-3 activity. these results suggest that oral bacteria, especially periodontal pathogens, may foster  p. aeruginosa invasion into respiratory epithelial cells to enhance host cell cytokine release and apoptosis.

AB  == this study assessed the prevalence and microbial interactions of fusobacterium nucleatum and fusobacterium necrophorum in primary endodontic infections from a brazilian population and their antimicrobial susceptibility to some antibiotics by the e-test. one hundred ten samples from infected teeth with periapical pathologies were analyzed by culture methods. five hundred eighty individual strains were isolated; 81.4% were strict anaerobes. f. nucleatum was found in 38  root canals and was associated with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., and eubacterium spp. f. necrophorum was found in 20 root canals and was associated with peptostreptococcus prevotii. the simultaneous presence of f. nucleatum and f. necrophorum was not related to endodontic symptoms (p > 0.05). they were 100% susceptible to amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and cephaclor. fusobacterium spp. is frequently isolated from primary-infected root canals of teeth with periapical pathologies. amoxicillin is a useful antibiotic against f. nucleatum and f. necrophorum in endodontic infections and has been prescribed as the first choice in brazil.

TI  == participation of glutathione in the elimination of porphyromonas gingivalis in vivo.
AB  == introduction: glutathione is involved in immune responses such as cell proliferation and bactericidal activity. the aim of this study was to see whether glutathione influences the intraperitoneal elimination of porphyromonas gingivalis in fusobacterium nucleatum-immunized mice. methods: mice were immunized with p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum, and then p. gingivalis was inoculated into the peritoneal cavity of the mice. after various lengths of time, the numbers of bacteria were determined by a colony-forming assay and by polymerase chain reaction. the effect of glutathione on the elimination of p. gingivalis was explored by changing the intracellular glutathione level. furthermore, we examined the effects of glutathione on the peritoneal levels of interferon-gamma, a macrophage activator, and of nitrite, a derivative of nitric  oxide that acts as an antimicrobial agent when produced by macrophages and neutrophils. results: inoculated p. gingivalis was eliminated more rapidly from f. nucleatum-immunized mice than from p. gingivalis-immunized mice. interferon-gamma levels in peritoneal lavage fluid and glutathione levels in peritoneal exudate cells were higher in f. nucleatum-immunized mice than in p. gingivalis-immunized mice. when p. gingivalis-immunized mice were given glutathione monoethylester (a derivative of glutathione that is converted to glutathione intracellularly through hydrolysis) into the peritoneal cavity, the elimination of p. gingivalis was accelerated. on the other hand, when f. nucleatum-immunized mice were given l-buthionine-[s,r]-sulfoximine (an inhibitor  of glutathione synthesis) into the peritoneal cavity, the elimination of p. gingivalis was suppressed. conclusion: in f. nucleatum-immunized mice, glutathione may have a key role in the defense against p. gingivalis infections.

TI  == streptococcus cristatus attenuates fusobacterium nucleatum-induced interleukin-8  expression in oral epithelial cells.
AB  == background and objective: oral epithelial cells may be invaded by a polymicrobial intracellular flora, including pathogens together with commensals. various oral pathogens can induce the production of interleukin-8, a potent neutrophil chemotractant, in oral epithelial cells. evidence from the gut suggests that commensal species may modulate inflammatory responses to pathogens. the aim of this study was to examine the interleukin-8 responses of oral epithelial cells to an oral pro-inflammatory species, fusobacterium nucleatum, in combination with an oral commensal, streptococcus cristatus. material and methods: kb, tert-2, tr146  and scc15 cells were cocultured with f. nucleatum and s. cristatus, either alone  or in combination, at 37 degrees c in 5% co2 under various conditions. the mrna expression of interleukin-8 was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay. results: f. nucleatum alone evoked a potent interleukin-8 response, whereas s. cristatus alone did not induce significant interleukin-8 expression in oral epithelial cells. when present together, s. cristatus attenuated the f. nucleatum-induced interleukin-8 production in the four oral epithelial cell lines to varying degrees. the inhibitory effect of s. cristatus was independent of its  viability and its co-aggregation with f. nucleatum, was not related to soluble bacterial products and appeared to require bacterial contact with epithelial cells. similar effects were seen with several other species of oral streptococci. conclusion: our data suggest that s. cristatus may exert immunomodulatory effects on the interleukin-8 response of oral epithelial cells to f. nucleatum challenge.

TI  == granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (gcp-2/cxcl6) complements interleukin-8 in periodontal disease.
AB  == background and objective: mucosal inflammatory responses are orchestrated largely by pro-inflammatory chemokines. the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (cxcl6) is involved in neutrophil recruitment and migration. previous studies have shown that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 is up-regulated during mucosal  inflammation (e.g. in inflammatory bowel disease), similarly to the functionally  and structurally related chemokine interleukin-8. nevertheless, unlike interleukin-8, a role of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival inflammation has not been yet demonstrated. in this study we aimed to evaluate the expression of the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in clinically healthy vs. diseased gingival tissues and to explore possible correlations with clinical and microbiological markers of periodontitis. material and methods: gene expression in 184 'diseased' and 63 'healthy' gingival tissue specimens from 90 patients with periodontitis was analyzed using affymetrix u133plus2.0 arrays. the expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was further confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while the localization of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival tissues was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. plaque samples from the adjacent periodontal pockets were collected and evaluated for 11 species of periodontal bacteria using checkerboard dna-dna hybridizations. results: among all known chemokines, gcp-2 expression was the most up-regulated (3.8-fold, p < 1.1 x 10(-16)), in 'diseased' vs. 'healthy' tissue as compared to  a 2.6-fold increased expression of interleukin-8 mrna (p < 1.2 x 10(-15)). increased expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlated with higher  levels of 'red' and 'orange' complex pathogens and with increased probing depth,  but not with attachment loss. immunohistochemistry showed that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was expressed in gingival vascular endothelium. conclusion: the level of expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlates with the  severity of periodontitis and appears to act as a hitherto unrecognized functional adjunct to interleukin-8 in diseased gingival tissues.

AB  == background: a recent clinical trial (obstetrics and periodontal therapy [opt] study) demonstrated that periodontal therapy during pregnancy improved periodontal outcomes but failed to impact preterm birth. the present study evaluated seven target bacteria, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, and fusobacterium nucleatum, in subgingival dental plaque of pregnant women in the opt study and their association with birth outcomes. methods: pregnant women were randomly assigned to receive periodontal treatment before 21 weeks' gestation or after delivery. subgingival plaque was sampled at baseline (13 to 16 weeks; 6 days of gestation)  and at 29 to 32 weeks. we analyzed subgingival plaque samples from women who experienced fetal loss, delivered a live preterm infant (preterm women), or delivered a full-term infant (full-term women). samples were analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. associations between preterm birth and bacterial counts and percentages were tested using multiple linear regression. results: no significant differences were observed at baseline between preterm and full-term women for any measured bacterial species or group of species, after accounting for multiple comparisons. changes in bacterial counts and proportions  during pregnancy also were not associated with birth outcomes. in full-term and preterm women, periodontal therapy significantly reduced (p <0.01) counts of all  target species except for a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusions: in pregnant women with periodontitis, non-surgical periodontal therapy significantly reduced  levels of periodontal pathogens. baseline levels of selected periodontal pathogens or changes in these bacteria resulting from therapy were not associated with preterm birth.

TI  == effects of low-energy shock waves on oral bacteria.
AB  == we have recently demonstrated that extracorporeal shock-wave therapy (eswt) is effective in promoting the healing of dermal wounds and in regenerating alveolar  bone lost through periodontal disease. the objective of the present study was to  determine any antibacterial effect of eswt on oral bacteria. monoculture suspensions of 6 bacterial species were treated with 100 to 500 pulses of eswt at energy flux densities (efd) of 0.12 mj/mm(2), 0.22 mj/mm(2), and 0.3 mj/mm(2). following treatment, aliquots were plated for viability determination and compared with untreated controls. eswt showed a significant microbicidal effect for streptococcus mutans and an unencapsulated strain of porphyromonas gingivalis following as few as 100 pulses at 0.3 mj/mm(2) (p <or= 0.001). in addition, a significant disruption of bacterial aggregates was observed at lower efds. no significant reduction in viability was observed for all other bacteria at efds and pulses tested (p > 0.05). these findings suggest that low-energy eswt may be  bactericidal for selected oral bacteria.

AB  == introduction: to facilitate the identification of anaerobes cultivated from periodontal disease, whole cell bacterial identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) was evaluated. methods: a total of 84 strains (nine reference strains and 75 recent clinical isolates from 33 patients with aggressive periodontitis) previously identified with phenotypic methods were used. all the references and 10 clinical  isolates belonging to the same species as the reference strains were genotypically identified by sequence analysis of the 16s ribosomal rna gene. all  the strains were then analyzed using maldi-tof-ms. results: the reference strains of anaerobic bacteria used showed characteristic maldi-tof-ms spectra with peaks  between m/z 2000 and up to about m/z 13,000. on visual inspection, the similarity of spectra produced by strains of a single genus could be recognized. obvious differences between spectra produced by strains of different species were also easily noticed. the reproducibility of the method was proved by the similarity of spectra belonging to the same species. the spectra of the prevotella intermedia strains identified with maldi clustered together and clustered separately from the spectra of prevotella nigrescens, proving that maldi-tof-ms is an accurate method that is capable of separating these two species. the quality of clustering was characterized by calculating an inconsistency coefficient (mathworks:/matlab  reference manual v2007a/, statistical toolbox). conclusion: our results suggest that maldi-tof-ms might become a useful method for the identification of anaerobic bacteria, especially for those that cannot be readily identified by biochemical analysis. it may become an attractive system even for the routine identification of clinical isolates.

TI  == photodynamic therapy as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
AB  == background: recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested a potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (pdt) in the treatment of periodontitis. however, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of pdt in the treatment of periodontitis. the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiologic effects of the adjunctive use of pdt to non-surgical periodontal treatment. methods: twenty-four subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomly treated with scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of pdt (test) or scaling and root planing alone (control). full-mouth plaque score (fmps), full-mouth bleeding score (fmbs), probing depth (pd), gingival recession, and clinical attachment level (cal) were measured at baseline and 3 and 6 months after therapy. primary outcome variables were changes in pd and cal. microbiologic evaluation of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans  (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), treponema denticola, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium nodatum, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga spp. was performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months following therapy by using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. results: at 3 and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups with regard to cal, pd,  fmps, or microbiologic changes. at 3 and 6 months, a statistically significantly  greater improvement in fmbs was found in the test group. conclusion: the additional application of a single episode of pdt to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of pd reduction and cal gain, but it resulted in a significantly higher reduction in bleeding scores compared to scaling and root planing alone.

TI  == [study of adherence of periodontal pathogens to collagen-treated hydroxyapatite].
AB  == objective: the ability of oral bacteria to adhere to tooth surface is associated  with their pathogenicity. the objective of this study was to compare the ability  of 4 strains of periodontal pathogens attaching to collagen-treated hydroxyapatite (c-ha) beads in order to evaluate the ability of the main periodontal pathogens to form the biofilm on root surface. methods: the binding amount and binding percentage of 4 strains to c-ha were measured and compared by  3h-labeled binding assay. 4 strains of periodontal pathogens were fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum) atcc 10953, porphyrin gingivalis (p. gingivalis) atcc 33277, prevotella intermedia (p. intermedia) atcc 25611 and hemophilic actinomycetemcomitans (h. actinomycetemcomitans) atcc 29523. results: the differences of the percentage of relative adherence between f. nucleatum atcc 10953 and p. gingivalis atcc 33277, as well as between h. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 29523 and p. intermedia atcc 25611 could not be observed. however, the percentage of relative adherence of f. nucleatum atcc 10953 and p. gingivalis atcc 33277 was higher than that of p. intermedia atcc 25611 and h. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 29523 (p<0.001), no matter cultured 24 h or 48 h. no significant difference of the percentage of the relative adherence of each stain  between 24 h and 48 h cultured time could be found. conclusion: f. nucleatum and  p. gingivalis exhibited strong binding ability to c-ha. their adherence to root surface may play an important role in their local aggregation, biofilm formation  during the development and recurrence of the periodontitis.

TI  == third molars and the efficacy of mechanical debridement in reducing pathogen levels in pregnant subjects: a pilot study.
AB  == purpose: to assess the impact of mechanical debridement (scaling and root planing), without adjunctive therapy, on reducing the numbers of periodontal pathogens detected in pregnant subjects with and without visible third molars. patients and methods: sixty-seven subjects in the second trimester of pregnancy were enrolled in an institutional review board-approved study. full mouth periodontal exams of all teeth were conducted at baseline and postpartum. presence or absence of third molars was noted. subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from the mesiobuccal of all first molars at enrollment and postpartum. subjects' total counts for periodontal pathogens in biofilm samples were determined by dna-dna checkerboard hybridization. we analyzed data from a subsample of 26 subjects. all subjects in the study were treated at enrollment by mechanical debridement of all teeth, including third molars. differences between  subjects' baseline and postpartum demographic and clinical characteristics were analyzed by chi(2) and t tests by presence or absence of third molars. statistical significance for differences in pathogen levels was determined by rank analysis of covariance. significance was set at 0.05 without correction for  multiple comparisons. results: most of the 26 subjects were african american (61%), on medicaid (92%), and did not smoke during pregnancy (88%). the 15 subjects with visible third molars were significantly older (28.0 years [sd 6.4]  vs 23.7 years [sd 3.9]). in the 11 subjects with no third molars noted, all pathogen counts were reduced postpartum. in the 15 subjects with visible third molars, total counts for each pathogen analyzed were higher postpartum as compared with subjects with no visible third molars, and their bacterial counts were increased for 5 of the 8 pathogens, including all "red cluster" pathogens. differences between study groups were observed by the presence or absence of third molars for t. forsythia and p. nigrescens (p = .04), and for p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, total "orange cluster" bacteria, and total pathogens (p < .06). conclusion: the efficacy of mechanical debridement to lower periodontal pathogen  counts during pregnancy was limited by the presence of visible third molars and should be analyzed further in larger scale trials.

TI  == periodontal status of patients with dentin dysplasia type i: report of three cases within a family.
AB  == background: dentin dysplasia type i (ddi) is a rare hereditary disturbance of dentin formation. it is characterized by clinically normal-appearing crowns; obliteration of pulp chambers; and short, blunted and malformed roots that are commonly associated with periodontal attachment loss (pal). in this context, we report three cases within a family with similar clinical and radiographic features of ddi but with differing microbiologic and periodontal conditions. methods: a 42-year-old white female and her two daughters (25 and 10 years of age) presented with a diagnosis of ddi. probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), visible plaque, and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded. subgingival biofilm samples were randomly collected and analyzed by checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization. results: the mother presented 34.9% of sites with pd > or  =4 mm, 41.3% of sites with cal > or =4 mm, and 57% of sites with bop; both daughters presented no sites with pd or cal >3 mm and <10% of sites with bop. microbiologic analysis detected gemella morbillorum, neisseria mucosa, and staphylococcus aureus in > or =50% of the mother's samples. the daughters showed  high levels (>10(4) bacterial cells) of some periodontopathic bacteria, including members of the red (porphyromonas gingivalis) and orange (fusobacterium periodonticum and f. nucleatum polymorphum) complexes and beneficial species of the yellow (streptococcus gordonii) and purple (veillonella parvula) complexes. the mother presented high mean levels only for four tested species (n. mucosa, prevotella melaninogenica, treponema denticola, and v. parvula). conclusion: a combination of radiographs, microbiologic analysis, and preventive professional monitoring care is important to avoid pal and to provide oral health in patients  with ddi.

TI  == comparative analysis of endodontic pathogens using checkerboard hybridization in  relation to culture.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of this study was to detect bacterial species and to  quantify the total number of bacteria from samples of infected root canals before (s1) and after chemo-mechanical preparation using 2% chlorhexidine (chx) gel as auxiliary chemical substance (s2) and after 7 days of intracanal dressing (s3) to compare microbial changes. method: twenty-four teeth were selected for this study. chemo-mechanical preparation was performed using 2% chx gel, then three different intracanal medicaments [m1: ca(oh)(2) paste; m2: 2% chx gel; and m3: ca(oh)(2) paste plus 2% chx gel] were used for 7 days. checkerboard dna-dna hybridization was performed to detect 40 bacterial species. aerobic and anaerobic culture techniques were used to determine the bacterial community by counting the colony-forming units (cfu). results: the species most frequently identified by checkerboard in s1 were: fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, treponema socranskii ssp. socranskii, parvimonas micra and enterococcus faecalis. in s2 and s3 a total of eight different species were identified; and only one of them was gram-positive (e. faecalis). microorganisms were not identified after use of m2 for 7 days. the quantification obtained on agar plates ranged from 4 x 10(5) to 2.6 x 10(6) cfu/ml in s1, mean cfu was reduced by 99.96% in s2, and there was no  statistical difference between the cfu in s2 and s3. conclusion: the antibacterial effect of the mechanical preparation supplemented by the use of an  antibacterial auxiliary substance greatly reduced the microorganisms in the main  root canal.

TI  == the anti-endotoxic effects of the ksl-w decapeptide on escherichia coli o55:b5 and various oral lipopolysaccharides.
AB  == background and objective: host responses following the recognition of bacterial lipopolysaccharide can range from acute inflammation to septic shock. the aim of  this study was to evaluate the ability of the ksl-w decapeptide to bind to and block the endotoxic effects of lipopolysaccharide. material and methods: an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based binding assay using fluorescently labeled ksl-w to detect adsorbed escherichia coli o55:b5 lipopolysaccharide was employed. a commercially available recombinant factor c lipopolysaccharide detection assay, hemagglutination of rabbit erythrocytes as well as e-selectin expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells were used to assess the anti-endotoxic effects after ksl-w exposure to e. coli lipopolysaccharide as well as to oral lipopolysaccharide samples. results: lipopolysaccharide-binding assays using e. coli o55:b5 lipopolysaccharide revealed both a higher maximal binding range (532-713 microm) and a half-maximum binding concentration (70-185 microm) for the ksl-w peptide when compared with its analog control. significant inhibition of e-selectin expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (p < 0.0001) as well as hemagglutination of rabbit erythrocytes occurred after the interaction of ksl-w with e. coli lipopolysaccharide. recombinant factor c enzyme detection inhibition revealed dose-dependent inhibition values ranging from 1.0-51.8 microm. which were dependent upon the type of lipopolysaccharide sample tested. conclusion: these results demonstrate that for the concentrations tested, the ksl-w decapeptide was nontoxic to mammalian cells and could bind to and block the host recognition and response towards enteric, as well as oral, lipopolysaccharide samples.

TI  == effects of age and oral disease on systemic inflammatory and immune parameters in nonhuman primates.
AB  == this report evaluated systemic inflammatory and immune biomarkers in a cohort of  macaca mulatta (rhesus monkeys) maintained as a large family social unit, including an age range from <1 year to >24 years. we hypothesized that the systemic host responses would be affected by the age, gender, and clinical oral presentation of the population, each contributing to inflammatory and immune responses that would reflect chronic oral infections. the results demonstrated that the prevalence and severity of periodontitis, including missing teeth, increased significantly with age. generally, minimal differences in clinical parameters were noted between the genders. systemic inflammatory mediators, including acute-phase reactants, prostaglandin e(2) (pge(2)), cytokines/chemokines, and selected matrix metalloproteinases (mmp), demonstrated  significant differences among the various age groups of animals. levels of many of these were increased with age, although pge(2), rantes, bactericidal permeability-inducing factor (bpi), mmp-1, and mmp-9 levels were significantly increased in the young group ( approximately 1 to 3 years old) relative to those  for the older animals. we observed that in the adult and aged animals, levels of  the systemic inflammatory mediators related to gingival inflammation and periodontal tissue destruction were significantly elevated. serum antibody levels in response to a battery of periodontal pathogens were generally lower in the young animals, <50% of those in the adults, and were significantly related to aging in the cohort. the levels of antibodies, particularly those to porphorymonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and tannerella forsythia, were most significantly elevated in animals with periodontal disease, irrespective of  the age of the animal. these results provide a broad description of oral health and host responses in a large cohort of nonhuman primates from very young animals to the aged of this species. the findings afford a base of data with which to examine the ontogeny of host responses at mucosal sites, such as the gingival tissues.

TI  == serum antibodies to porphyromonas gingivalis chaperone htpg predict health in periodontitis susceptible patients.
AB  == background: chaperones are ubiquitous conserved proteins critical in stabilization of new proteins, repair/removal of defective proteins and immunodominant antigens in innate and adaptive immunity. periodontal disease is a chronic inflammatory infection associated with infection by porphyromonas gingivalis that culminates in the destruction of the supporting structures of the teeth. we previously reported studies of serum antibodies reactive with the human chaperone hsp90 in gingivitis, a reversible form of gingival disease confined to  the oral soft tissues. in those studies, antibodies were at their highest levels  in subjects with the best oral health. we hypothesized that antibodies to the hsp90 homologue of p. gingivalis (htpg) might be associated with protection/resistance against destructive periodontitis. methodology/principal findings: elisa assays using cloned htpg and peptide antigens confirmed gingivitis subjects colonized with p. gingivalis had higher serum levels of anti-htpg and, concomitantly, lower levels of attachment loss. additionally, serum antibody levels to p. gingivalis htpg protein were higher in healthy subjects compared to patients with either chronic or aggressive periodontitis. we found a negative association between tooth attachment loss and anti-p. gingivalis htpg (p = 0.043) but not anti-fusobacterium nucleatum (an oral opportunistic commensal) htpg levels. furthermore, response to periodontal therapy was more successful in subjects having higher levels of anti-p. gingivalis htpg before treatment (p = 0.018). there was no similar relationship to anti-f. nucleatum htpg levels. similar results were obtained when these experiments were repeated with a synthetic peptide of a region of p. gingivalis htpg. conclusions/significance: our results suggest: 1) anti-p. gingivalis htpg antibodies are protective and therefore predict health periodontitis-susceptable  patients; 2) may augment the host defence to periodontitis and 3) a unique peptide of p. gingivalis htpg offers significant potential as an effective diagnostic target and vaccine candidate. these results are compatible with a novel immune control mechanism unrelated to direct binding of bacteria.

TI  == role of porphyromonas gingivalis serb in gingival epithelial cell cytoskeletal remodeling and cytokine production.
AB  == the serb protein of porphyromonas gingivalis is a had family serine phosphatase that plays a critical role in entry and survival of the organism in gingival epithelial cells. serb is secreted by p. gingivalis upon contact with epithelial  cells. here it is shown by microarray analysis that serb impacts the transcriptional profile of gingival epithelial cells, with pathways involving the actin cytoskeleton and cytokine production among those significantly overpopulated with differentially regulated genes. consistent with the transcriptional profile, a serb mutant of p. gingivalis exhibited defective remodeling of actin in epithelial cells. interaction between gingival epithelial  cells and isolated serb protein resulted in actin rearrangement and an increase in the f/g actin ratio. serb protein was also required for p. gingivalis to antagonize interleukin-8 accumulation following stimulation of epithelial cells with fusobacterium nucleatum. serb is thus capable of modulating host cell signal transduction that impacts the actin cytoskeleton and cytokine production.

TI  == smap29 congeners demonstrate activity against oral bacteria and reduced toxicity  against oral keratinocytes.
AB  == introduction: cathelicidins are antimicrobial peptides found in epithelial and mucosal tissues as well as the secondary granules of neutrophils. smap29, a sheep cathelicidin, has differential antimicrobial properties against various pathogens, including periodontal organisms. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties and cytotoxicity of smap29, smap28, and three congeners (smap18a, smap18d, and smap14a). methods: the peptides at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 250 microg/ml were tested for their activity  against multiple strains of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and porphyromonas gingivalis using a radial diffusion assay. cytotoxicity of keratinocytes was evaluated by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release after incubation with the individual peptides. results: smap28, thought to be the biologically active peptide, was the most potent antimicrobial (range of minimum  inhibitory concentrations 0.06-7.03 microg/ml, p < 0.05); however, the activity of smap28 and smap29 was strongly associated (r = 0.933). the congeners also demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the bacteria tested (range of minimum inhibitory concnetrations 0.21-79 microg/ml). overall, f. nucleatum was the most  susceptible organism, while p. gingivalis was the least susceptible. keratinocyte cytotoxicity was dependent on peptide length and dose. smap28 was the most cytotoxic, while smap14a was the least cytotoxic. conclusion: the antimicrobial activities against oral microorganisms and the minimal toxicity seen in this study suggest that the congeners of smap29 may serve as an alternative to traditional antibiotics in the prevention and treatment of periodontal and other  oral diseases.

TI  == relationship between campylobacter rectus and periodontal status during pregnancy.
AB  == introduction: in a previous study, we showed that the growth of campylobacter rectus is stimulated by the presence of female sex hormones in the culture medium. in the present study, we examined the relationship between c. rectus levels in the saliva and the periodontal status of pregnant women. methods: unstimulated whole saliva was collected from 22 pregnant and 15 non-pregnant women. periodontal pocket depth (pd) and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded. a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine the concentrations of suspected periodontopathogenic bacteria in the saliva samples.  in addition, the concentration of estradiol in the saliva samples was measured by enzyme immunoassay. results: the average age, number of teeth, and total number of bacteria in the saliva of subjects in both groups were similar. the percentage of sites with a pd = 4 mm and the salivary estradiol concentrations were significantly higher in pregnant women than in non-pregnant women. in addition, the percentage of bop sites and the c. rectus levels in the saliva of the pregnant women tended to be higher than in non-pregnant women, although these differences were not statistically significant. there were positive correlations  between c. rectus levels and estradiol concentrations, and between c. rectus levels and the percentage of sites with pd = 4 mm in the pregnant women. conclusion: these results indicate that c. rectus levels are higher in the oral flora of pregnant women and that this may be associated with increased salivary estradiol concentrations. this may contribute to periodontal disease progression  during pregnancy.

TI  == stimulation of fusobacterium nucleatum biofilm formation by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == background/aims: bacterial infection is a major cause of periapical periodontitis. eradication of these microorganisms from apical lesions is essential to the success of endodontic treatment. the aim of this study was to clarify the molecular interaction between fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas  gingivalis and other microorganisms associated with periapical periodontitis. methods: microorganisms isolated from periapical lesions were inoculated into type-i collagen-coated polystyrene microtiter plates and maintained at 37 degrees c under anaerobic conditions for 2 days, after which, the quantity of organized biofilm on the plates was evaluated by crystal violet staining. growth enhancement via soluble factor was evaluated by separated coculture using a 0.4-mum membrane filter. results: f. nucleatum exhibited strong adherence to type-i collagen-coated polystyrene microplates. biofilm formation by f. nucleatum was significantly enhanced by p. gingivalis. it was complemented by compartmentalized coculture with p. gingivalis. enhancement of biofilm formation  by p. gingivalis was only slightly reduced by inactivation of its autoinducer-2-producing gene luxs. conclusion: the results suggest that p. gingivalis enhances biofilm formation by f. nucleatum by releasing diffusible signaling molecules other than autoinducer-2.

TI  == effect of rinsing with an essential oil-containing mouthrinse on subgingival periodontopathogens.
AB  == background: studies have shown that the nature and amount of supragingival plaque can influence the composition of the contiguous subgingival flora. the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of rinsing with an essential oil antimicrobial mouthrinse on levels of representative subgingival bacteria in subjects with mild to moderate periodontitis. methods: this controlled study used a randomized, double-masked, 2 x 2 crossover design. after baseline subgingival sampling, 37 qualifying subjects rinsed with the essential oil mouthrinse or a negative control twice daily for 14 days, with a post-treatment sample obtained on day 15. following a washout period, the procedure was repeated with the alternative rinse. target organisms enumerated were porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, veillonella sp., and total anaerobes. intergroup comparisons of post-treatment log-transformed colony forming unit counts were made using analysis of covariance. results: after 14 days of twice-daily rinsing, the level of each of the target subgingival organisms was significantly lower in  the essential oil group than in the control group (p < 0.001), with percent reductions ranging from 66.3% to 79.2%. conclusions: rinsing with the essential oil antiplaque/antigingivitis mouthrinse can have significant antimicrobial activity against subgingival periodontopathogens. most likely, the antimicrobial  effect was mediated primarily by disruption of the contiguous supragingival plaque by the mouthrinse. because studies have shown that control of supragingival plaque can influence the onset and/or progression of periodontitis, additional studies on non-prescription antimicrobial oral care products may lead  to new regimens for decreasing the burden of periodontal diseases in the population.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of propolis and other substances against selected endodontic pathogens.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial effect of ethanol extract of propolis (eep) and intracanal medicaments calcium hydroxide, camphorated paramonochlorophenol, and formocresol by means of the macrodilution method using the reinforced clostridial medium (rcm) and brucella and brain heart infusion media. study design: the antimicrobial agents were sequentially diluted  and tested against anaerobic bacteria prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces israelii, and clostridium perfringens and against enterococcus faecalis, with the 5 x 10(5) cfu/ml standardized inocula. the tubes  were anaerobically incubated and the minimum inhibitory concentration was detected. blood agar rcm subcultures were performed to provide minimum bactericidal concentration. the results were analyzed by analysis of variance test. results: all drugs were effective against all tested strains, without statistical differences. e. faecalis was the less susceptible strain, and rcm broth promoted faster bacterial growth, but there were no significant differences in these results. ethanol did not influence the antimicrobial effect of eep.

TI  == innate immune responses of gingival epithelial cells to nonperiodontopathic and periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == background and objective: we have previously reported different susceptibilities  of periodontopathic and nonperiodontopathic bacteria to antimicrobial peptides and phagocytosis by neutrophils. differences between the two groups of bacteria may exist also in their ability to induce immune responses from the host. therefore, we evaluated the effects of various oral bacteria on innate immune responses by gingival epithelial cells. material and methods: hok-16b cells were  cocultured with live or lysed nonperiodontopathic (n = 3) and periodontopathic (n = 5) bacterial species. the levels of human beta defensin-1, -2 and -3, and of the cathelicidin, ll-37, were examined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and the accumulated interleukin-8 and interleukin-1 alpha were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results:  nonperiodontopathic bacteria up-regulated some antimicrobial peptides without affecting the levels of cytokines. in the periodontopathic group, the orange-complex bacteria induced antimicrobial peptides and interleukin-8 efficiently, but the red-complex bacteria often demonstrated suppressive effects. in contrast to live bacteria, bacterial lysates had no suppressive effects. in addition, some bacterial lysates demonstrated a reduced ability to induce antimicrobial peptides compared with live bacteria. conclusion: the nonperiodontopathic, the orange-complex, and the red-complex bacteria had different effects on the innate immune responses from gingival epithelial cells,  which may affect the outcome of their host-microbial interaction in gingival sulcus.

TI  == improved accuracy in terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism phylogenetic analysis using a novel internal size standard definition.
AB  == background: terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis is commonly used to analyze microbial communities, including oral microflora. however, accurate identification of terminal restriction fragment (t-rf) origins  is prevented by unpredictable errors in sizing, thus necessitating the clone library analysis. to minimize sizing errors, we proposed optimizing the size definition of internal standards. methods: genescan-1000 rox was regenerated as an internal standard by redefining the fragment sizes in terms of molecular weight (mw) based on their mobility relative to 6-carboxyfluorescein (fam) -labeled restriction fragments derived from the 16s recombinant rna gene of porphyromonas gingivalis. using the new size definition, the average sizing error among eight oral bacteria from six phyla was estimated and compared with that of  the conventional method. microbial communities isolated from saliva were analyzed using the new mw size definition. bacterial species were assigned to peaks using  trfma, a web-based tool for t-rflp analysis, and compared with those identified in a clone library analysis. results: using the new size definition, the average  sizing error for 40 t-rfs was drastically reduced from 2.42 to 0.62 bases, and large sizing errors (more than two bases) were eliminated. more than 90% of the total bacterial clones detected by the clone library analysis were assigned by t-rflp. conclusion: the size definition of the newly constructed internal standards reduced fragment sizing errors and allowed for accurate assignment of bacteria to peaks by the t-rflp analysis. this provided a more effective means for studying microbial communities, including the oral microflora.

TI  == evaluation of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections using checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in 111 selected cases of single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. methods: samples were collected from the  root canals using #15 hedstroen-type files and two sterile paper points, which were introduced 1 mm short of the apical foramen. the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 different bacterial species in each sample were determined using dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization techniques. results: the  mean number of species per sample was 22. enterococcus faecalis (89.3%), campylobacter gracilis (89.3%), leptotrichia buccalis (89.3%), neisseria mucosa (87.5%), prevotella melaninogenica (86.6%), fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii (85.7%), eubacterium saburreum (75.9%), streptococcus anginosus (75%),  and veillonella parvula (74.1%) were the most prevalent species. the species found in highest mean counts (over 10(5)) were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii (13.14 x 10(5)), e. saburreum (5.67 x 10(5)), e. faecalis (5.38 x 10(5)), n. mucosa (4.19 x 10(5)), v. parvula (3.63 x 10(5)), c. gracilis (3.46 x 10(5)), treponema  socranskii (3.34 x 10(5)), porphyromonas endodontalis (2.96 x 10(5)), porphyromonas gingivalis (2.85 x 10(5)), micromonas micros (2.81 x 10(5)), prevotella nigrescens (2.68 x 10(5)) and fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum (2.64 x 10(5)). most of these species were also found in high proportions. conclusions: our results suggest that several bacterial species considered to be  oral pathogens seem to be implicated in the etiology of primary endodontic infections.

TI  == compressed mints and chewing gum containing magnolia bark extract are effective against bacteria responsible for oral malodor.
AB  == flavors and natural botanic extracts are often used in chewing gum and compressed mints for breath freshening and relief of oral malodor. the oral malodor is a result of bacterial putrification of proteinaceous materials from food or saliva. in this study, magnolia bark extract (mbe) and its two main components, magnolol  and honokiol, were evaluated by the minimum inhibition concentration (mic) test.  the inhibitory effect of mbe mint was further evaluated by a kill-time assay study. in addition, an in vivo study was performed on nine healthy volunteers postlunch. saliva samples were taken before and after subjects consumed mints and gum, with and without mbe. listerine mouthwash was included as a positive control. the testing results indicated that mbe and its two main constituents demonstrated a strong germ-kill effect against bacteria responsible for halitosis and also streptococcus mutans, bacteria involved in dental caries formation. the  mic of magnolol, honokiol, and mbe on porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and s. mutans ranged from 8 to 31 microg/ml. kill-time assay results indicated that mints containing 0.2% mbe reduced more than 99.9% of three oral bacteria within 5 min of treatment. the in vivo study demonstrated that mbe containing mints reduced total salivary bacteria by 61.6% at 30 min and 33.8% at  60 min postconsumption. in comparison, the flavorless mint reduced total salivary bacteria by 3.6% at 30 min and increased total bacteria by 47.9% at 60 min. the mbe containing chewing gum reduced total salivary bacteria by 43.0% at 40 min, while placebo gum reduced total salivary bacteria by 18.0%. in conclusion, mbe demonstrated a significant antibacterial activity against organisms responsible for oral malodor and can be incorporated in compressed mints and chewing gum for  improved breath-freshening benefits.

TI  == implant surface analysis and microbiologic evaluation of failed implants retrieved from smokers.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the microbiota and surface of failed titanium dental implants from 4 manufacturers. twelve mobile dental implants were retrieved from 10 smokers after 3 to 10 years of functional loading. before implant removal, microbial samples were taken and evaluated using polymerase chain reaction. after implant removal, analyses of the failed implant surfaces were performed using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectrometer x-ray. periodontal pathogens such as aggregactibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were detected in all implants in different proportions. surface analysis showed varying degrees of surface roughness between the samples  and the presence of proteinaceous material, appearing mainly as dark stains. foreign carbon, oxygen, sodium, calcium, aluminum, and silicon elements were also found. although no material-related causes of implant failure were detected, several periodontal pathogens were identified independently of the surface topography or manufacturer.

TI  == effects of glass ionomer and microfilled composite subgingival restorations on periodontal tissue and subgingival biofilm: a 6-month evaluation.
AB  == background: this 6-month study evaluated the effects of resin-modified glass-ionomer cement (rmgi) and microfilled composite (mc) subgingival restorations on periodontal tissues and subgingival biofilm. methods: fifty-four  periodontally healthy patients were assigned as follows: group 1 (n = 18), root exposure (re) without non-carious cervical lesions (nccl) treated with coronally  positioned flap (cpf); group 2 (n = 18), re with nccl treated rmgi restorations plus cpf; group 3 (n = 18), re with nccl treated with mc restorations plus cpf. probing depth (pd), visible local plaque score (pl), and local bleeding on probing (bop) were assessed at baseline and 6 months after surgeries. restored and non-restored root recoverage (rr) was assessed at 6 months. each experimental tooth was subgingivally sampled (baseline and 6 months) and analyzed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: clinical results showed no significant differences among the groups regarding pl, bop, and pd at baseline and 6 months. the rr means were similar among the groups at 6 months. intragroup  analyses revealed that the proportions of 10 periodontopathogens decreased at 6 months for the control group. for the rmgi group, there was a significant decrease in the proportions of nine periodontopathogens. for the mc group, there  was a significant increase in the proportions of fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum and gemella morbillorum and a decrease in five periodontopathogens. intergroup analyses showed an increase in the proportion of f. nucleatum polymorphum for the mc group. conclusions: in a 6-month evaluation, well-finished rmgi or mc subgingival restorations did not negatively affect periodontal health. furthermore, rmgi seems to exert more positive effects on the subgingival biofilm composition than mc.

TI  == cultivable bacteria in infected root canals as identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing.
AB  == introduction: traditionally, cultivable bacteria isolated from infected root canals have been identified by phenotype-based methods. because 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene sequencing has emerged as a more accurate and reliable tool for bacterial identification, the present study applied this approach to identify bacterial isolates recovered from the root canals of teeth with chronic apical periodontitis. methods: anaerobic techniques were used for culturing; identification of the isolates was carried out by polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing of the v5-v8 region of the 16s rrna gene. bacteria were found in all samples. the mean number of taxa per canal was 3.1, ranging from 2 to 8. the median number of cultivable bacterial cells in the root canals was 4.2 x 10(5), ranging from 2.8 x 10(3) to 3.3 x 10(7). eighty-seven strains belonging to 52 bacterial taxa were identified. the most prevalent taxa were fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, micromonas micros and streptococci. the following bacterial phyla  were represented in this study: firmicutes (22 taxa, 46% of the identified isolates), actinobacteria (14 taxa, 25.3% of the isolates), bacteroidetes (eight  taxa, 13.8% of the isolates), fusobacteria (three taxa, 9.2% of the isolates) and proteobacteria (five taxa, 5.7% of the isolates). some of the isolates represented unnamed species not previously cultivated and characterized. in conclusion, our findings using a combined anaerobic culture-molecular identification approach confirmed the polymicrobial nature of primary endodontic  infections with dominance of anaerobic bacteria. notably several bacteria that are difficult or impossible to identify by phenotypic means were identified, including previously uncultivated taxa, cultivated-but-not-yet-characterized taxa and newly named species.

TI  == effect of an essential oil-containing antimicrobial mouthrinse on specific plaque bacteria in vivo.
AB  == aim: this study was conducted to investigate the effect of rinsing with an essential oil-containing mouthrinse on levels of specific supra and subgingival bacteria in subjects with gingivitis. material and methods: fifteen subjects meeting entry criteria completed this randomized, controlled, double-blind, crossover study. subjects were required to have >or=1000 target organisms per millilitre in pooled samples from two subgingival sites. following sampling of supra and subgingival plaque, subjects began twice-daily rinsing for 14 days with either an essential oil-containing mouthrinse (cool mint listerine antiseptic) or a negative control. supra and subgingival plaque was again sampled on day 15, and the procedure repeated after a 1-week washout period with subjects using the alternate rinse. results: compared with the negative control, the essential oil mouthrinse produced significant reductions in supragingival plaque levels of veillonella sp., capnocytophaga sp., fusobacterium nucleatum, and total anaerobes ranging from 52.3 to 88.5% (p<0.001 except for veillonella, p=0.002); respective  reductions in subgingival plaque ranged from 54.1 to 69.1% (p<0.001). conclusions: rinsing with the essential oil mouthrinse can have an impact on the  subgingival plaque flora. this study provides additional evidence indicating that reduction in supragingival plaque can reduce levels of subgingival plaque.

TI  == periodontal bacterial dna suppresses the immune response to mutans streptococcal  glucosyltransferase.
AB  == certain cpg motifs found in bacterial dna enhance immune responses through toll-like receptor 9 (tlr-9) and may also demonstrate adjuvant properties. our objective was to determine if dna from bacteria associated with periodontal disease could affect the immune response to other bacterial antigens in the oral  cavity. streptococcus sobrinus glucosyltransferase (gtf), an enzyme involved in dental caries pathogenesis, was used as a test antigen. rowett rats were injected with aluminum hydroxide (alum) with buffer, alum-gtf, or alum-gtf together with either escherichia coli dna, fusobacterium nucleatum dna, or porphyromonas gingivalis dna. contrary to expectation, animals receiving alum-gtf plus bacterial dna (p. gingivalis in particular) demonstrated significantly reduced serum immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody, salivary iga antibody, and t-cell proliferation to gtf compared to animals immunized with alum-gtf alone. a diminished antibody response was also observed after administration of alum-gtf with the p. gingivalis dna either together or separately, indicating that physical complexing of antigen and dna was not responsible for the reduction in antibody. since tlr triggering by dna induces synthesis of prospective suppressive factors (e.g., suppressor of cytokine signaling [socs]), the effects  of p. gingivalis dna and gtf exposure on rat splenocyte production of socs family molecules and inflammatory cytokines were investigated in vitro. p. gingivalis dna significantly up-regulated socs1 and socs5 expression and down-regulated interleukin-10 expression by cultured splenocytes. these results suggested that dna from periodontal disease-associated bacteria did not enhance, but in fact suppressed, the immune response to a protein antigen from cariogenic streptococci, potentially through suppressive socs components triggered by innate mechanisms.

TI  == activation of toll-like receptors 2 and 4 by gram-negative periodontal bacteria.
AB  == background/aims: periodontitis is a chronic infectious disease associated with a  gram-negative subgingival microflora. bacterial components stimulate, among other receptors, toll-like receptor (tlr) 2 and/or tlr4. accumulating evidence indicates that both qualitatively and quantitatively distinct immune responses result from the triggering of tlr2 as compared to tlr4 triggering. the aim was to study the interaction of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum and veillonella parvula with tlr2 and tlr4. we investigated all known serotypes (k(-), k1-k6) of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a-e strains for their potency to stimulate cytokine production. methods: human embryonic kidney (hek) cells, stably transfected with cd14, cd14-tlr2, or cd14-tlr4 and whole blood were stimulated with bacterial sonicates. cytokine production (interleukin-6, -8, -10 and -12) was measured in the supernatant by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: all test bacteria stimulated hek-cd14-tlr2, but only a. actinomycetemcomitans and v. parvula stimulated hek-cd14-tlr4. no differences were found in the activation  of hek-cd14-tlr2/4, or cytokine production in whole blood between serotypes of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusion: gram-negative periodontal bacteria predominantly stimulated tlr2, which may be of importance for the th1/th2 cell orientation of the immune response in periodontitis.

TI  == differential activation of nf-kappab and gene expression in oral epithelial cells by periodontal pathogens.
AB  == to investigate the molecular effects of the periodontopathogens fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) and porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) on the oral epithelium, the h400 oral epithelial cell line was cultured in the presence of non-viable bacteria. following confirmation of the presence of transcripts for the bacterial pattern recognition receptors in h400 cells, toll-like receptors -2, -4 and -9, and components of the nf-kappab signalling pathway, immunocytochemical analyses were  performed showing that nf-kappab was activated within 1 h of exposure to both periodontopathogens. a significantly greater number of nf-kappab nuclear translocations were apparent following h400 cell exposure to fn as compared with  pg. gene expression analyses indicated that transcripts known to be regulated by  the nf-kappab pathway, including cytokines/chemokines tnf-alpha, il-1beta, il-8,  mcp-1/ccl2 and gm-csf, were up-regulated following 4 and 24 h of exposure to both periodontopathogens. in addition, h400 periodontopathogen exposure resulted in differential regulation of transcripts for several cytokeratin gene family members. consistent with the immunocytochemical data, microarray results indicated that fn induced a greater number of gene expression changes than pg following 24 h of exposure, 609 and 409 genes, respectively. ninety-one genes were commonly differentially expressed by both periodontopathogens and represented biological processes commonly associated with periodontitis. gene expression analyses by reserve transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) of molecules identified from the microarray data sets, including heme oxygenase-1, lysyl oxidase, sod2, ccl20 and calprotectin components, confirmed their differential expression profiles induced by the two periodontopathogens. fn and pg have clearly different molecular effects on oral epithelial cells, potentially highlighting the importance of the composition of the plaque biofilm  in periodontitis pathogenesis.

TI  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide regulates matrix metalloproteinase, tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase, and plasminogen activator production by human gingival fibroblasts: a potential role in connective tissue destruction.
AB  == fibroblasts, a major constituent of gingival connective tissue, can produce immunoregulatory cytokines and proteolytic enzymes that may contribute to tissue  destruction. in this study, we evaluated the production of matrix metalloproteinases (mmps), tissue inhibitors of mmps (timps), and plasminogen activators by gingival fibroblasts stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (lps) produced by periodontopathogens, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.  in addition, changes in the expression and phosphorylation state of fibroblast intracellular signaling proteins induced by a. actinomycetemcomitans lps were characterized using antibody microarrays. we showed that a. actinomycetemcomitans lps induced the production of a 50 kda plasminogen activator, mmp-2 and, to a lesser extent, mmp-3 by fibroblasts. the stimulation of fibroblasts with a. actinomycetemcomitans lps also resulted in the overproduction of timp-1, but had  no effect on the production of timp-2. comparable responses were also obtained with porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum lps. the results of the microarray analyses showed that a. actinomycetemcomitans lps induced changes in the phosphorylation state and expression of gingival fibroblast intracellular signaling proteins. more specifically, they suggested that a. actinomycetemcomitans lps may induce both jun n-terminus protein-serine kinases (jnk) and mitogen-activated protein-serine kinase p38 alpha (p38alpha mapk) pathway activation, leading to increased activator protein-1 (ap-1) and nuclear factor kappa-b (nfkappab) activities, which in turn can stimulate mmp-2,  mmp-3, timp-1, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (upa) expression. this may contribute to periodontal connective tissue destruction.

TI  == interleukin-1alpha stimulation in monocytes by periodontal bacteria: antagonistic effects of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == periodontal pathogenic bacteria are associated with elevated levels of interleukin-1alpha (il-1alpha) but it is unclear if all species can induce cytokine production equally. porphyromonas gingivalis may be able antagonize il-1alpha induced by other species through the activity of its proteases or lipopolysaccharide (lps). monomac-6 cells and primary human monocytes were treated with culture supernatants from porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedius, veillonella atypical and prevotella nigrescens. il-1alpha protein levels were measured after 6 h of incubation. in addition, monocytes were co-stimulated with supernatants from p. gingivalis and other bacteria. the role of p. gingivalis proteases was tested using arg-x and lys-x mutant strains. the role of lps was investigated using purified p. gingivalis lps and polymixin depletion. all species tested induced significant il-1alpha production, but p. gingivalis was the weakest. co-stimulation of monocytes with p. gingivalis antagonized the ability of other bacterial species to induce il-1alpha production. this effect was at its greatest with c. rectus (resulting in a 70% reduction). gingipain mutant strains and chemical inhibition of protease activity did not reduce antagonistic activity. however, 100 ng/ml of p. gingivalis lps can reproduce the antagonistic activity of p. gingivalis culture supernatants. periodontitis-associated bacterial species stimulate il-1alpha production by monocytes. p. gingivalis can antagonize this effect, and its lps appears to be the crucial component. this study highlights the importance of mixed infections in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease because reduction of pro-inflammatory  cytokine levels may impair the ability of the host to tackle infection.

TI  == sensitivity of oral bacteria to 254 nm ultraviolet light.
AB  == aim: to explore the sensitivity of bacteria commonly found in root canals to 254  nm ultraviolet (uv) light, either as individual cells or as participants of a bacterial multilayer. methodology: the sensitivity of oral bacteria, as individual cells, to uv light was tested by subjecting plates streaked with bacteria to 254 nm uv, at a fluence of 1-20 mj cm(-2). an experimental model was  designed to produce a bacterial multilayer and to study absorption of uv light by bacteria in an outer layer and its effect on the elimination of bacteria in the inner layer. results: direct exposure to relatively low doses of uv light (2-7 mj cm(-2)) effectively eliminated all bacterial strains tested. furthermore, an enterococcus faecalis strain, partially resistant to a 24 h exposure to calcium hydroxide, was effectively eliminated within several seconds of exposure to uv light (p < 0.001). uv was absorbed by a multilayer of bacteria. when 4 bacterial  cells microm(-2) were present in the light path, the uv light dose had to be increased by a factor of x10 to achieve 100% elimination of the bacteria in an inner layer. conclusions: the application of uv light to eliminate endodontic pathogens may be possible. nevertheless, its absorbance by outer layers of bacteria should be considered and the uv light dose adapted accordingly.

TI  == inflammation associated with implants with different surface types.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to determine the nature of the inflammatory infiltrate associated with different transmucosal implant surfaces in dogs. methods: three experimental and one control single-stage implants were randomly placed on each side of the jaw in eight dogs. the transmucosal portion of the test implants consisted of an acid-etched surface (type a), a machined surface with a circumferential groove (type c) and a surface prepared by mild anodic oxidation (type d). the control was a standard machined surface (type b). in order to determine the response to the different surfaces, plaque control was carried out twice weekly following placement of the implants for the entire period of the experiment. at 6 months, gingival biopsies and plaque samples were  obtained. the area of inflammatory infiltrate and the nature of the infiltrating  cell types were determined using immunohistology. real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to identify putative periodontal pathogens. results: inflammatory infiltrates were associated with all implant surfaces and were commonly found subepithelially and perivascularly. t cells were the predominant infiltrating cell type in all lesions, associated with the different surfaces. in all lesions the cd4 : cd8 ratio was approximately 2 : 1. statistical analysis showed that the type c surface (machined surface with a groove) had significantly larger inflammatory infiltrates than the type b surface (machined surface without a groove; p<0.05). no statistically significant differences were found with respect to the size of the inflammatory infiltrates or in terms of the nature of  infiltrating cells. however, despite the intensive plaque control regime, plaque  was present on all implant surfaces at the time of biopsy 6 months after placement. all implants had similar numbers of tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, was not detected in any sample. conclusions: these results suggest that the development of inflammation associated with implants is independent of surface type, but is nevertheless associated with the presence of  plaque. the different surfaces had no influence on the nature of the infiltrate,  with t cells being the predominant cell type in all lesions. finally, the different implant surface types seemed not to influence the peri-implant microbiota. however, the presence of the circumferential groove tended to be associated with larger infiltrates. whether this is due to increased plaque accumulation remains to be determined.

TI  == rat model of polymicrobial infection, immunity, and alveolar bone resorption in periodontal disease.
AB  == one of the predominant polymicrobial infections of humans is expressed clinically as periodontal disease. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia have been strongly implicated as members of a pathogenic consortium in the etiology of adult periodontitis. in this study we hypothesized  that p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia are synergistic in terms of virulence potential and induce chronic periodontal inflammation that leads to alveolar bone resorption in a polymicrobial infection in rats. groups of rats were infected with either p. gingivalis, t. denticola, or t. forsythia in monomicrobial infections or with all three species in polymicrobial oral infections with or without fusobacterium nucleatum. pcr analyses of oral microbial samples demonstrated that rats infected with one bacterium were orally  colonized by each of the bacteria during the study interval, and increased serum  immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody levels substantiated the interaction of the host  with the infecting bacteria. pcr analyses of the rats with polymicrobial infections demonstrated that most rats were infected with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia as a consortium. furthermore, all rats exhibited a significant increase in the level of igg antibody to the polymicrobial consortium. radiographic measurement of alveolar bone resorption showed that rats infected with the polymicrobial consortium with or without f. nucleatum exhibited significantly increased alveolar bone resorption compared to the resorption in uninfected control rats, as well as the resorption in rats infected with one of the microbes. these results documented that p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia not only exist as a consortium that is associated with chronic periodontitis but also exhibit synergistic virulence resulting in the immunoinflammatory bone resorption characteristic of periodontitis.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal species in symptomatic and asymptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  == phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal 16s rrna was used to examine polymicrobial communities within infected root canals of 20 symptomatic and 14 asymptomatic patients. nucleotide sequences from approximately 750 clones amplified from each patient group with universal bacterial primers were matched to the ribosomal database project ii database. phylotypes from 37 genera representing actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, firmicutes, fusobacteria and proteobacteria were identified. results were compared to those obtained with species-specific primers designed to detect prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas  gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus sp., streptococcus sp., fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythensis and treponema denticola. since members of the domain archaea have been implicated in  the severity of periodontal disease, and a recent report confirms that archaea are present in endodontic infections, 16s archaeal primers were also used to detect which patients carried these prokaryotes, to determine if their presence correlated with severity of the clinical symptoms. a methanobrevibacter oralis-like species was detected in one asymptomatic and one symptomatic patient. dna from root canals of these two patients was further analysed using species-specific primers to determine bacterial cohabitants. trep. denticola was  detected in the asymptomatic but not the symptomatic patient. conversely, porph.  endodontalis was found in the symptomatic but not the asymptomatic patient. all other species except enterococci were detected with the species-specific primers  in both patients. these results confirm the presence of archaea in root canals and provide additional insights into the polymicrobial communities in endodontic  infections associated with clinical symptoms.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of acidified nitrate and nitrite on six common oral pathogens in vitro.
AB  == background: salivary nitrate is positively correlated with plasma nitrate and its level is 9 times the plasma level after nitrate loading. nitrate in saliva is known to be reduced to nitrite by oral bacteria. nitrate and nitrite levels in saliva are 3 - 5 times those in serum in physiological conditions respectively in our previous study. the biological functions of high salivary nitrate and nitrite are still not well understood. the aim of this in vitro study was to investigate  the antimicrobial effects of nitrate and nitrite on main oral pathogens under acidic conditions. methods: six common oral pathogens including streptococcus mutans nctc 10449, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4646, porphyromonas gingivalis  atcc 33277, capnocytophaga gingivalis atcc 33624, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953, and candida albicans atcc 10231 were cultured in liquid medium. sodium nitrate or sodium nitrite was added to the medium to final concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 10 mmol/l. all of the microorganisms were incubated for 24 to 48 hours. the optical densities (od) of cell suspensions were determined and the cultures were transferred to solid nutrient broth medium to observe the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration for the six tested pathogens. results: nitrite at concentrations of 0.5 to 10 mmol/l  had an inhibitory effect on all tested organisms at low ph values. the antimicrobial effect of nitrite increased with the acidity of the medium. streptococcus mutans nctc 10449 was highly sensitive to nitrite at low ph values. lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4646 and candida albicans atcc 10231 were relatively resistant to acidified nitrite. nitrate at the given concentrations and under acidic conditions had no inhibitory effect on the growth of any of the  tested pathogens. conclusion: nitrite, at a concentration equal to that in human  saliva, is both cytocidal and cytostatic to six principal oral pathogens in vitro, whereas nitrate at a similar concentration has no antimicrobial effect on  these organisms.

TI  == effects of sonicated prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and lactobacillus casei extracts on interleukin-8 production by human dental pulp cells.
AB  == the objective of this study was to determine the effects of prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and lactobacillus casei on the production of  il-8 by human dental pulp cells. human dental pulp cells from teeth of young patients (aged 18-25 years) were cultured and tested with sonicated p. intermedia atcc 25611, f. nucleatum atcc 25586 and l. casei atcc 4646 extracts. il-8 secreted into the culture supernatants were measured at 6, 12 and 24 hours using  a quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique. cell viability was evaluated using trypan blue exclusion technique. il-8 production by human dental  pulp cells increased significantly at 12 and 24 hours after exposure to p. intermedia and f. nucleatum, whereas l. casei extract exhibited low il-8 production. the sonicated bacterial extracts did not significantly affect viability or total number of dental pulp cells.

TI  == carpegen real-time polymerase chain reaction vs. anaerobic culture for periodontal pathogen identification.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to compare two methods of microbiological diagnosis, anaerobic bacterial culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr), for the detection of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and treponema denticola. methods: seventy-two samples were collected from 18 patients who were suffering from aggressive periodontitis. the data obtained were compared for the two methods. results: the results obtained with real-time pcr were different from those obtained with bacterial culture. the detection differences were 3% for a. actinomycetemcomitans, 8.33% for p. intermedia, and 12.5% for f. nucleatum. however, the differences for p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were 51.39% and 36.11%, respectively. no comparison was possible for t. denticola because it cannot be identified in culture. the variations found were the result of the better detection level (10(2) pathogens)  of the pcr probe. unlike bacterial culture, pcr allows the detection of t. denticola, which does not forming colonies and is oxygen sensitive. for f. nucleatum, t. forsythia and p. gingivalis, the real-time pcr technique was more sensitive than culture. conclusion: good results were obtained with the real-time pcr technique for the six periopathogens targeted. this method seems to be indicated for its simplicity, rapidity and reproducibility but it cannot analyze  data for an antibiotic susceptibility test. the periodontist must therefore choose one of these two methods according to his specific clinical objective: to  obtain rapid, specific detection even with weak initial concentrations (but for targeted periopathogens only) or to be non-specific and analyze the pathological  activity with an antibiogram.

TI  == photodynamic therapy for endodontic disinfection.
AB  == the aims of this study were to investigate the effects of photodynamic therapy (pdt) on endodontic pathogens in planktonic phase as well as on enterococcus faecalis biofilms in experimentally infected root canals of extracted teeth. strains of microorganisms were sensitized with methylene blue (25 microg/ml) for  5 minutes followed by exposure to red light of 665 nm with an energy fluence of 30 j/cm2. methylene blue fully eliminated all bacterial species with the exception of e. faecalis (53% killing). the same concentration of methylene blue  in combination with red light (222 j/cm2) was able to eliminate 97% of e. faecalis biofilm bacteria in root canals using an optical fiber with multiple cylindrical diffusers that uniformly distributed light at 360 degrees. we conclude that pdt may be developed as an adjunctive procedure to kill residual bacteria in the root canal system after standard endodontic treatment.

TI  == coaggregation interactions between oral and endodontic enterococcus faecalis and  bacterial species isolated from persistent apical periodontitis.
AB  == interactions between enterococcus faecalis and other species found in root canal  infections might be important for the development and persistence of periapical disease. the aim of this study was to investigate the coaggregation interactions  between e. faecalis clinical isolates and species previously shown to survive and induce apical periodontitis in monkeys: peptostreptococcus anaerobius, prevotella oralis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and streptococcus anginosus. intergeneric coaggregation assays were conducted in duplicate with observations scored immediately at 0 h, 1 h and 24 h after mixing of combinations of strains. all e.  faecalis strains (n = 53) coaggregated with f. nucleatum; e. faecalis did not coaggregate with p. anaerobius or s. anginosus. one strain, e. faecalis e1, coaggregated with p. oralis, with aggregates visible at 1 h. coaggregation interactions between e. faecalis and f. nucleatum observed in this study suggest  a potential role for this combination in endodontic infections.

TI  == antibacterial effect of electrolyzed water on oral bacteria.
AB  == this study investigated the antibacterial effect of electrolyzed water on oral bacteria both in vitro and in vivo. tap water was electrolyzed in a water vessel  using platinum cell technology. the electrolyzed tap water (called puri-water) was put in contact with five major periodontopathogens or toothbrushes contaminated with these bacteria for 30 sec. in addition, puri-water was used as  a mouthwash for 30 sec in 16 subjects and the antibacterial effect on salivary bacteria was evaluated. puri-water significantly reduced the growth of all periodontopathogens in culture and on toothbrushes, and that of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in saliva, when compared to the effect of tap water. it also significantly reduced mutans streptococci growing on mitis salivarius-bacitracin  agar. our results demonstrate that the electrolyzed tap water is effective as a mouthwash and for toothbrush disinfection.

TI  == association of eubacterium nodatum and treponema denticola with human periodontitis lesions.
AB  == background: the purpose of the present investigation was to compare the levels, proportions and percentage of sites colonized by 40 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples from periodontally healthy subjects and patients with  chronic periodontitis to seek possible pathogens other than the consensus pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. method: subgingival  plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 635 subjects with chronic periodontitis and 189 periodontally healthy subjects. the samples were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (total samples = 21,832). mean counts, % dna probe counts and percentage of sites colonized at >10(5) were determined for each species in each subject and then averaged in each clinical group. significance of difference between groups was determined using the mann-whitney test. association between combinations of species and periodontal status was examined by stepwise logistic regression analysis. analyses were repeated using a subset of subjects from both clinical groups who had proportions of p. gingivalis plus t. forsythia  less than the median (4.42%) found in periodontally healthy subjects. all analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: for the 824 subjects the consensus pathogens p. gingivalis and t. forsythia as well as eubacterium nodatum and treponema denticola had significantly higher mean counts, proportions and percentage of sites colonized in samples from subjects with periodontitis than from periodontally healthy subjects. there were significantly more capnocytophaga gingivalis, streptococcus gordonii and veillonella parvula in periodontally healthy subjects. e. nodatum, t. denticola, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii all had higher  counts and proportions in diseased than healthy subjects who had low proportions  of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia. logistic regression analysis indicated that the same species groups were associated with disease status after adjusting for the proportions of the other species. conclusions: this investigation confirmed the strong association of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia with chronic periodontitis and emphasized a strong association of e. nodatum and t. denticola  with periodontitis whether in the presence or absence of high levels of the consensus pathogens. other species, including s. oralis, eikenella corrodens, s.  intermedius and f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, were associated with disease when p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were present in low proportions.

TI  == influence of residual bacteria on periapical tissue healing after chemomechanical treatment and root filling of experimentally infected monkey teeth.
AB  == the purpose of this study was twofold: first, to determine the influence on the healing of the periapical tissues when selected bacterial strains and combinations thereof remain after root canal treatment; and, second, the relationship to healing of the quality of the root filling. in eight monkeys, 175 root canals, previously infected with combinations of four or five bacterial strains and with radiographically verified apical periodontitis, were endodontically treated, bacteriologically controlled, and permanently obturated.  after 2-2.5 yr, the periapical regions were radiographically and histologically examined. of these teeth, 48 root canals were also examined for bacteria remaining after removal of the root fillings. when bacteria remained after the endodontic treatment, 79% of the root canals showed non-healed periapical lesions, compared with 28% where no bacteria were found. combinations of residual bacterial species were more frequently related to non-healed lesions than were single strains. when no bacteria remained, healing occurred independently of the  quality of the root filling. in contrast, when bacteria remained, there was a greater correlation with non-healing in poor-quality root fillings than in technically well-performed fillings. in root canals where bacteria were found after removal of the root filling, 97% had not healed, compared with 18% for those root canals with no bacteria detected. the present study demonstrates the importance of obtaining a bacteria-free root canal system before permanent root filling in order to achieve optimal healing conditions for the periapical tissues.

TI  == expression of the short fimbriae of porphyromonas gingivalis is regulated in oral bacterial consortia.
AB  == the mfa1 protein of porphyromonas gingivalis is the structural subunit of the short fimbriae and mediates coadhesion between p. gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii. we utilized a promoter-lacz reporter construct to examine the regulation of mfa1 expression in consortia with common oral plaque bacteria. promoter activity of mfa1 was inhibited by s. gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus mitis. in contrast, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus cristatus, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum did not affect mfa1 expression. expression of sspa/b, the streptococcal receptor for mfa1, was not required for regulation of mfa1 promoter activity. proteinaceous molecule(s) in oral streptococci may be responsible for regulation of mfa1 expression. porphyromonas gingivalis is capable of detecting heterologous organisms, and responds to selected organisms by specific gene regulation.

TI  == inflammation, heat shock proteins and periodontal pathogens in atherosclerosis: an immunohistologic study.
AB  == background: inflammation is a significant component of atherosclerosis lesions. bacteria, including periodontopathogens, have been demonstrated in atherosclerotic plaques and cross-reactivity of the immune response to bacterial  groel with human heat shock protein 60 has been suggested as a link between infections and atherosclerosis. methods: in this study, the nature of the inflammatory infiltrate and the presence of human heat shock protein 60 and groel were examined in 31 carotid endarterectomy specimens. additionally, monoclonal antibodies were used to detect the presence of six bacteria, including those implicated in periodontal disease. results: the inflammatory cell infiltrate of the lesions was dominated by cd14(+) macrophages and cd4(+) t cells. most cells of the infiltrate as well as the endothelium were hla-dr(+), indicating activation; however, there was an absence of cd25 expression, demonstrating that  the activated t cells were not proliferating. few cd1a(+) and cd83(+) cells were  noted. human heat shock protein 60 expression was evident on endothelial cells and cells with the appearance of smooth muscle cells and lymphocytes. groel and bacteria were detected within intimal cells. chlamydia pneumoniae, porphyromonas  gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were found in 21%, 52%, 34%, 34%, 41%, and 17% of arteries, respectively. conclusion: these results give evidence for a  specific immune response associated with atherosclerosis. whether bacteria initiate the observed inflammation in atherosclerotic lesions is not clear; however, the present study shows that maintenance of inflammation may be enhanced by the presence of periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial barrier of an in vitro oral epithelial model.
AB  == objective: oral epithelia function as a microbial barrier and are actively involved in recognizing and responding to bacteria. our goal was to examine a tissue engineered model of buccal epithelium for its response to oral bacteria and proinflammatory cytokines and compare the tissue responses with those of a submerged monolayer cell culture. design: the tissue model was characterized for  keratin and beta-defensin expression. altered expression of beta-defensins was evaluated by rt-pcr after exposure of the apical surface to oral bacteria and after exposure to tnf-alpha in the medium. these were compared to the response in traditional submerged oral epithelial cell culture. results: the buccal model showed expression of differentiation specific keratin 13, hbd1 and hbd3 in the upper half of the tissue; hbd2 was not detected. hbd1 mrna was constitutively expressed, while hbd2 mrna increased 2-fold after exposure of the apical surface  to three oral bacteria tested and hbd3 mrna increased in response to the non-pathogenic bacteria tested. in contrast, hbd2 mrna increased 3-600-fold in response to bacteria in submerged cell culture. hbd2 mrna increased over 100-fold in response to tnf-alpha in the tissue model and 50-fold in submerged cell culture. thus, the tissue model is capable of upregulating hbd2, however, the minimal response to bacteria suggests that the tissue has an effective antimicrobial barrier due to its morphology, differentiation, and defensin expression. conclusions: the oral mucosal model is differentiated, expresses hbd1 and hbd3, and has an intact surface with a functional antimicrobial barrier.

TI  == antimicrobial actions of benzimidazoles against the oral anaerobes fusobacterium  nucleatum and prevotella intermedia.
AB  == background/objective: benzimidazoles are widely used as proton-pump inhibitors to control stomach hyperacidity and have been found also to have antimicrobial actions against helicobacter pylori and oral streptococci. our primary aim was to determine if they are active also against oral anaerobes associated with gingivitis. our major focus was on catabolism because it leads to production of inflammatory metabolites such as butyrate and ammonia. the benzimidazoles are effective in the protonated form at acid ph values and cause irreversible inhibition of enzymes associated with formation of drug-target disulfide bonds. methods: fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586 and prevotella intermedia atcc 25611  were grown anaerobically in suspension cultures, harvested, washed and exposed to the benzimidazole lansoprazole at ph values of 4 or 5 before being washed and used for standard assays to detect inhibition of catabolic functions, uptake of the agent and lethality. results: lansoprazole was found to be a bacteriostatic,  multi-target antimicrobial against f. nucleatum under anaerobic conditions inhibitory for amino acid fermentation and also for glycolysis of glucose or fructose. id(50) values for fermentation of amino acids and dipeptides by f. nucleatum ranged from 0.05 mm for lysine to 0.25 mm for serine. fructose catabolism was highly sensitive with an id(50) value of 0.03 mm apparently related to high sensitivity of the phosphoenolpyruvate:fructose phosphotransferase system, while the id(50) for glucose catabolism by intact cells was some 0.07 mm. fermentation of aspartate or aspartylaspartate by p. intermedia was found to be lansoprazole-sensitive with id(50) values of about 0.18 and 0.20 mm, respectively. conclusion: catabolism of amino acids, dipeptides and sugars by oral anaerobes associated with gingivitis are sensitive to the inhibitory actions of lansoprazole. thus, catabolic pathways are potential targets for use of benzimidazoles against bacteria involved in gingivitis.

TI  == selective inhibition of porphyromonas gingivalis growth by a factor xa inhibitor, dx-9065a.
AB  == background: porphyromonas gingivalis is a causative bacterium of adult periodontitis. however, there is no drug specific for p. gingivalis and for its virulence factor. objectives: the objective of this study was to examine the effects of a new selective inhibitor of activated factor x, dx-9065a, on growth of porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontopathic bacteria. methods: we incubated p. gingivalis and other periodontopathic bacteria in the presence or absence of dx-9065a and examined the effect of dx-9065a on bacterial growth and trypsin-like activity in its cultures. we also examined the effects of dx9065a on amidolytic activity of purified trypsin-like proteinases (gingipains rgpa and rgpb), from p. gingivalis and on trypsin-like activity in gingival crevicular fluids from patients with adult periodontitis. results: dx-9065a selectively inhibited the growth of p. gingivalis and prevotella intermedia, and its effect on p. gingivalis was bactericidal. trypsin-like proteinase activity was detected  in p. gingivalis, and the activity was strongly inhibited by dx-9065a. dx-9065a even inhibited amidolytic activity of rgpa and rgpb from p. gingivalis. furthermore, trypsin-like proteinase activity in gingival crevicular fluids was strongly inhibited by dx-9065a. conclusions: dx-9065a inhibits p. gingivalis growth in part through to its ability to inhibit the trypsin-like proteinase activity in p. gingivalis and may be useful for a new drug for treatment of adult periodontitis.

TI  == inhibitory effects of macrocarpals on the biological activity of porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == background/aims: macrocarpals, which are phloroglucinol derivatives contained in  eucalyptus leaves, exhibit antimicrobial activity against a variety of bacteria including oral bacteria. this study examined effects of macrocarpals a, b, and c  on periodontopathic bacteria, especially porphyromonas gingivalis. methods: macrocarpals a, b, and c were purified from a 60% ethanol-extract of eucalyptus globules leaves. to investigate antibacterial activity, representative periodontopathic bacteria were cultured in media with or without various amounts  of macrocarpals; subsequently, the optical density at 660 nm was measured. macrocarpal inhibition of p. gingivalis arg- and lys-specific proteinases was assessed by spectrofluorophotometric assay and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. the effect of macrocarpals on p. gingivalis binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads was examined with  (3)h-labeled p. gingivalis. results: growth of p. gingivalis was inhibited more strongly than growth of prevotella intermedia or prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola by macrocarpals, however, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum were much more resistant. macrocarpals inhibited p. gingivalis arg- and lys-specific proteinases in a dose-dependent manner. the enzyme-inhibitory effect of macrocarpals was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis in which hemoglobin degradation by p. gingivalis proteinase was inhibited by macrocarpals. p. gingivalis binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads was also strongly attenuated by macrocarpals. conclusions: macrocarpals a, b and c demonstrated antibacterial activity against periodontopathic bacteria. among tested bacteria,  p. gingivalis displayed the greatest sensitivity to macrocarpals; additionally, its trypsin-like proteinase activity and binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite  beads were inhibited by macrocarpals. these results indicate that eucalyptus leaf extracts may be useful as a potent preventative of periodontal disease.

TI  == coaggregation of porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum pk 1594 is  mediated by capsular polysaccharide and lipopolysaccharide.
AB  == previous reports have shown that coaggregation between porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum, two important periodontopathogens, is mediated by a  galactoside on the surface of p. gingivalis and a lectin on f. nucleatum. in the  present study, purified capsular polysaccharide (cps) and lipopolysaccharide (lps) of p. gingivalis pk 1924 (serotype k5) were found to be able to bind to f.  nucleatum cells and to inhibit binding of f. nucleatum to p. gingivalis serotype  k5. sugar binding studies showed that the requirements for binding of p. gingivalis serotype k5 cps and lps to the f. nucleatum lectin are: the presence of a metal divalent ion, an axial free hydroxyl group at position 4 and free equatorial hydroxyl groups at position 3 and 6 of d-galactose. these data suggest that p. gingivalis serotype k5- cps and lps act as receptors mediating coaggregation between p. gingivalis and fusobacteria.

AB  == aims: the objective of this study was to characterize the inhibitory effects of weissella cibaria isolates on volatile sulphur compounds (vsc) production both in vitro and in vivo. material and methods: we isolated and identified three hydrogen peroxide-generating lactobacilli from children's saliva, and assessed their inhibitory effects on vsc production and fusobacterium nucleatum proliferation. clinical studies were conducted with 46 subjects in order to measure the vsc of their mouth air. results: these lactobacilli were identified as w. cibaria. these isolates inhibited the production of vsc by f. nucleatum (p<0.05). the concentration of f. nucleatum was decreased by 5-log cycles as a result of exposure to the w. cibaria strains (p<0.05), whereas the catalase-treated w. cibaria cultures exerted no evident inhibitory effects on f.  nucleatum replication. in the clinical studies, gargling with one isolate resulted in a significant reduction in the levels of h2s and ch3sh by approximately 48.2% (p<0.01) and 59.4% (p<0.05), respectively. conclusions: these results indicate that w. cibaria isolates possess the ability to inhibit vsc production under both in vitro and in vivo conditions, demonstrating that they bear the potential for development into novel probiotics for use in the oral cavity.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacteria in asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to use terminal restriction fragment length  polymorphism analysis and the 16s rrna gene clone library to investigate the diversity of the microbiota associated with asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections and to compare the bacterial community structure in these two clinical conditions. samples were taken from asymptomatic endodontic infections associated with chronic periradicular lesions and from symptomatic infections clinically diagnosed as acute abscesses. 16s rrna genes from dna isolated from clinical samples were used to construct clone libraries or were subjected to terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. sequence analysis of 186 clones revealed 42 taxa; 23 (55%) were uncultivated phylotypes, of which seven were unique to endodontic infections. clone sequencing and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed that the most commonly detected taxa were fusobacterium nucleatum (including terminal restriction fragment types 1 and 2), peptostreptococcus micros/peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone aj062/bs044/fg014, prevotella species, dialister species, mogibacterium species, lachnospiraceae oral clone 55a-34, filifactor alocis, megasphaera sp. oral clone cs025/bs073, and veillonella sp. oral clone bp1-85/veillonella dispar/v. parvula. bacteroides-like sp. oral clone x083/bacteroidales oral clone mce7_20 and dialister sp. oral clone bs016/mce7_134 were detected only in asymptomatic teeth. on the other hand, f. nucleatum terminal restriction fragment type 2, prevotella intermedia, dialister pneumosintes, and some phylotypes were exclusively detected in symptomatic samples. bacterial profiles of symptomatic endodontic infections generated by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis were clearly different from those of asymptomatic infections. overall, the average number of terminal restriction fragments in symptomatic samples was significantly larger than in asymptomatic samples. molecular analysis of the microbiota associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic endodontic infections indicates that the endodontic bacterial diversity is greater than previously described by culture methods and that the structure of the microbiota differ significantly between asymptomatic and symptomatic infections.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis heat shock protein vaccine reduces the alveolar bone loss induced by multiple periodontopathogenic bacteria.
AB  == objectives: heat shock protein (hsp) can be utilized as a vaccine to cross-protect against multiple pathogenic species. the present study was performed to evaluate porphyromonas gingivalis heat shock protein 60 (hsp60) as a vaccine candidate to inhibit multiple bacteria-induced alveolar bone loss. material and methods: recombinant p. gingivalis hsp60 was produced and purified from p. gingivalis groel gene. rats were immunized with p. gingivalis hsp60, and  experimental alveolar bone loss was induced by infection with multiple periodontopathogenic bacteria. results: there was a very strong inverse relationship between postimmune anti-p. gingivalis hsp immunoglobulin g (igg) levels and the amount of alveolar bone loss induced by either p. gingivalis or multiple bacterial infection (p=0.007). polymerase chain reaction data indicated  that the vaccine successfully eradicated the multiple pathogenic species. conclusions: we concluded that p. gingivalis hsp60 could potentially be developed as a vaccine to inhibit periodontal disease induced by multiple pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == streptococci dominate the diverse flora within buccal cells.
AB  == previously, we reported that intracellular actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythensis were present within buccal  epithelial cells from human subjects, as lesser components of a polymicrobial flora. in this study, we further characterized that intracellular flora by using  the same double-labeling techniques to identify fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, oral campylobacter species, eikenella corrodens, treponema denticola, gemella haemolysans, granulicatella adiacens, and total streptococci within buccal epithelial cells. all those species were found within buccal cells. in every case, species recognized by green-labeled species-specific probes were accompanied by other bacteria recognized only by a red-labeled universal probe. streptococci appeared to be a major component of the polymicrobial intracellular  flora, being present at a level from one to two logs greater than the next most common species (g. adiacens). this is similar to what is observed in oral biofilms, where diverse species interact in complex communities that often are dominated by streptococci.

TI  == antibacterial action of photoactivated disinfection {pad} used on endodontic bacteria in planktonic suspension and in artificial and human root canals.
AB  == objectives: to measure antibacterial action of photoactivated disinfection (pad)  on endodontic bacteria in planktonic suspension and root canals. methods: four bacteria, fusobacterium nucleatum,peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus intermedius, were tested in suspension. after mixing equal volumes of tolonium chloride and bacterial suspension for 60s, each 200 microl of concentration (>10(6)cfu ml(-1)) was irradiated with light at 633+/-2 nm. each energy dose/tolonium chloride concentration combination was tested eight times, with controls. prepared root canals in training blocs and extracted human  teeth were inoculated with s. intermedius followed by 10 mg l(-1) tolonium chloride or saline. bacteria in canals were sampled before and after light irradiation. student t-test assessed significance of changes in viable bacteria produced by treatment of either light or tolonium chloride alone and light/tolonium chloride combinations. results: in suspension, reductions in bacteria were highly significant (p<0.01) for light/tolonium chloride combinations compared to light or tolonium chloride alone. maximum mean log reductions of 1.14 (p. intermedia), 2.48 (p. micros), 2.81 (f. nucleatum) and 6.73 (s. intermedius) were at 4.8 j/20 mg l(-1). antibacterial action was increased by energy dose increase (not always significantly), but not by tolonium chloride concentration. in control canals mean log reductions of 0.42 (blocs) and 0.38 (teeth) from initial levels were not significant. pad mean log reductions of 2.40 (blocs) and 2.01 (teeth) were highly significant. changes for pad/energy dose combinations were not significant. conclusion: pad killed endodontic bacteria at statistically significant levels compared to controls. kills varied with bacterial species.

TI  == cross-reactivity of groel antibodies with human heat shock protein 60 and quantification of pathogens in atherosclerosis.
AB  == background/aims: chronic infections such as those caused by chlamydia pneumoniae  and periodontopathic bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis have been associated with atherosclerosis, possibly due to cross-reactivity of the immune response to bacterial groel with human heat shock protein (hhsp) 60. methods: we  examined the cross-reactivity of anti-groel and anti-p. gingivalis antibodies with hhsp60 in atherosclerosis patients and quantified a panel of six pathogens in atheromas. results: after absorption of plasma samples with hhsp60, there were variable reductions in the levels of anti-groel and anti-p. gingivalis antibodies, suggesting that these antibodies cross-reacted with hhsp60. all of the artery specimens were positive for p. gingivalis. fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, c. pneumoniae, helicobacter pylori, and haemophilus influenzae were found in 84%, 48%, 28%, 4%, and 4% of arteries, respectively. the prevalence of the three periodontopathic microorganisms, p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum and t. forsythia, was significantly higher than that of the remaining three microorganisms. conclusions: these results support the hypothesis that in some patients, cross-reactivity of the immune response to bacterial hsps including those of periodontal pathogens, with arterial endothelial cells expressing hhsp60 may be a possible mechanism for the association between atherosclerosis and periodontal infection.

TI  == differential induction of human beta-defensin expression by periodontal commensals and pathogens in periodontal pocket epithelial cells.
AB  == background: to investigate the possible role of beta-defensins in gingival health and periodontal disease, we examined the effect of several stimuli on the expression of interleukin-8 (il-8), human beta-defensin-1, -2, -3, and -4 (hbd) in primary human diseased gingival epithelial (hge) cell cultures from periodontitis patients by quantitative taqman reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). methods: several strains of the periodontopathogens actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were added to the cells, as well as the oral commensal bacteria fusobacterium nucleatum and escherichia coli. the induction by the proinflammatory stimuli phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (pma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) was also tested. results: in addition to the published observations (pma induces hbd-2 and -4; tnf-alpha induces hbd-2 and -3), it was found that pma can upregulate hbd-1 and hbd-3, whereas tnf-alpha can induce hbd-4. the commensal bacteria were significant inducers of hbd-2, hbd-3, and il-8. the pathogen p. gingivalis induced hbd-1 and hbd-3 at different time points than the commensals,  but no induction of il-8 and hbd-2 could be observed. these data fit with the chemokine paralysis theory. a correlation was found between the pathogenicity of  different serotypes of a. actinomycetemcomitans and the induction profiles of defensins and il-8. conclusion: the results suggest that a correlation can be found in diseased oral epithelium between the defensin profiles that are induced  and the pathogenicity of the oral bacterial strains.

TI  == antimicrobial profiles of periodontal pathogens isolated from periodontitis patients in the netherlands and spain.
AB  == background and aim: antimicrobial resistance of periodontal pathogens towards currently used antibiotics in periodontics has been investigated in a previous study. microbial resistance in the periodontal microflora was more frequently observed in spanish patients in comparison with dutch patients. the aim of the present study was to compare antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of five periodontal bacteria isolated from periodontitis patients in spain and in the netherlands. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples from adult patients with periodontitis were collected and cultured on selective and non-selective plates. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and micromonas micros were isolated and used for minimal inhibitory concentration tests using the epsilometer (e-test) technique. eight different antibiotics were tested on all bacterial isolates. mic50 and mic90 values for each antibiotic and each species were determined and the percentage of resistant strains was calculated. results:  significantly higher mic values were noted in spanish strains of f. nucleatum for penicillin, ciprofloxacin, of p. intermedia for penicillin, amoxicillin and tetracycline, of m. micros for tetracycline, amoxicillin and azithromycin, and of p. gingivalis for tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. based on breakpoint concentrations, a higher number of resistant strains in spain were found in f. nucleatum for penicillin, amoxicillin and metronidazole, in prevotella intermedia for tetracycline and amoxicillin, and in a. actinomycetemcomitans for amoxicillin and azithromycin. resistance of p. gingivalis strains was not observed for any of the antibiotics tested both in spain and the netherlands. conclusions: differences exist in the susceptibility profiles of periodontal pathogens isolated from periodontitis patients in spain and in the netherlands. this implicates that antibiotic susceptibility testing is necessary to determine efficacy of antimicrobial agents. also, clinical studies with antibiotics should  take these differences into account. the information from the present study indicates that it may not be possible to develop uniform protocols for usage of antibiotics in the treatment of severe periodontitis in the european union.

TI  == multi-target antimicrobial actions of zinc against oral anaerobes.
AB  == objective: zinc is used in oral care products as an antiplaque/antigingivitis agent. our objective was to assess the antimicrobial actions of zinc against oral anaerobes associated with gingivitis, specifically fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia, with focus on catabolism and oxidative metabolism. methods: the oral anaerobes were grown in complex medium in an anaerobic chamber, harvested by centrifugation and used directly for experiments with suspensions. biofilm growth involved super-infection by f. nucleatum of an initial biofilm formed by streptococcus sanguis. results: zn(2+) inhibited catabolism of glutamate, glutamyl-glutamate, glucose and fructose by f. nucleatum cells in suspensions with id(50) values, respectively, of 0.05, 0.005, 0.01 and 0.01 mm. the id(50) value for inhibition of glutamate catabolism by biofilms was 0.10 mm.  inhibition of glutamate catabolism could be related to inhibition of substrate uptake and of 2-oxoglutarate reductase. zn(2+) also inhibited catabolism of aspartate or aspartyl-aspartate by p. intermedia with id(50) values of 0.07 and about 0.03 mm, respectively. respiration of intact cells of f. nucleatum and nadh oxidase in cell extracts were sensitive to zinc with id(50) values, respectively, of about 1.0 and 1.4 mm. zinc also inhibited production of hydrogen peroxide by f. nucleatum (id(50) = ca. 0.04 mm.) but at high concentrations acted to potentiate and enhance peroxide killing of the anaerobe. conclusion: zn(2+) is a  potent inhibitor of catabolism by f. nucleatum and p. intermedia, including catabolism of peptides, which can be degraded to yield inflammatory metabolic end products. zn(2+) also inhibits o(2) metabolism of f. nucleatum by about 50% and hydrogen peroxide production nearly completely but also enhances killing by peroxide added to cells.

TI  == fiber optic fluorescence microprobe for endodontic diagnosis.
AB  == successful endodontic therapy requires total debridement as well as complete obturation of the root canal to the cemento-dentinal junction. the goal of this study was to investigate the feasibility of using quantitative fluorescence spectroscopy for the detection and localization of pathological dentin, pulpal remnants, and microorganisms within the root canal. specific aims were to identify: 1) characteristic excitation/emission spectra for healthy dentin, decayed dentin, enamel, and pulp; 2) the potential of specific spectral data for  differentiating between these tissues; and 3) the potential of spectral data for  detecting the presence and identifying four common endodontic pathogens. fluorescence spectra were determined in the tissues of permanent human teeth, extirpated healthy and necrotic pulps, and four endodontic pathogens. excitation/emission spectra were collected at 366 nm, 405 nm, and 440 nm excitation. marked differences in spectral signatures between the different tissues under investigation were observed. we postulate that the differences in fluorescence spectra of decayed vs. healthy dentin are due to the loss of mineralized tissue components and increased organic presence and water in these tissues. pulpal tissue showed distinctly different fluorescence spectra from healthy and decayed dentin, providing a basis for differentiating between tissue  categories. each bacterial species demonstrated distinct spectral emission patterns.

TI  == treponema medium glycoconjugate inhibits activation of human gingival fibroblasts stimulated with phenol-water extracts of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == oral treponemes are well-known as causative agents of periodontal diseases; however, the details have not been fully clarified. here, we examined the effects of treponema medium glycoconjugate on the activation of human gingival fibroblasts using phenol-water extracts from porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the phenol-water extracts activated human gingival fibroblasts to mediate il-8 production, as well as il-8 mrna expression, phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1. t. medium glycoconjugate exhibited no activation of human gingival fibroblasts, while phenol-water extract-induced activation of human gingival fibroblasts was clearly inhibited by t. medium glycoconjugate. furthermore, binding of biotinylated phenol-water extracts to cd14 in the presence of lps-binding protein was blocked with t. medium glycoconjugate. these results suggest that t. medium glycoconjugate has an inhibitory effect on host cell activation by periodontopathic bacteria caused by  binding to cd14- and lps-binding protein.

TI  == [pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis of antibiotic therapy in dentistry and  stomatology].
AB  == introduction: this study evaluates the efficacy of various antimicrobial treatments for orofacial infections on the basis of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (pk/pd) criteria. methods: a complete a literature search was undertaken to establish the mic90 values of the five microorganisms most frequently isolated in odontogenic infections and the pharmacokinetic parameters of 13 antibiotics used in these infections. pharmacokinetic simulations were then carried out with mean population parameters and efficacy indexes were calculated for the 47 treatment regimens analyzed. for  drugs showing time-dependent antibacterial killing, the time above mic (t > mic)  was calculated. for drugs with concentration-dependent bactericidal activity, the auc/mic was calculated. results: amoxicillin-clavulanic (500 mg/8 h or 1000 mg/12 h) and clindamycin (300 mg/6 h) in the time-dependent killing group and moxifloxacin (400 mg/24 h) in the concentration-dependent group showed adequate efficacy indexes against the five pathogens considered to be the most commonly implicated in odontogenic infections. the spiramycin plus metronidazole combination, present in the commercial formulation rhodogyl, did not reach satisfactory pk/pd indexes. conclusion: pk/pd indexes, which are useful predictors of the potential efficacy of antibacterial therapy, were used with ontogenic infections in the present study. the pk/pd simulations showed that amoxicillin-clavulanic, clindamycin and moxifloxacin were the most suitable antibiotics for this kind of infection. clinical trials are required to confirm that this methodology is useful in these pathologic processes.

TI  == quantitative detection of volatile sulfur compound- producing microorganisms in oral specimens using real-time pcr.
AB  == objective: it is well-known that some periodontopathic bacteria, especially porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia (formerly bacteroides forsythus or tan. forsythensis), and treponema denticola, actively produce volatile sulfur compounds (vscs), such as h2s and ch3sh. we previously reported a qualitative relationship between periodontopathic bacteria and vscs; however, a quantitative analysis of periodontopathic bacteria in oral specimens is required for further characterization of the relationship between oral bacteria and vscs. in this study, we report a real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method for the quantitative analysis of vsc-producing bacteria in oral specimens. subjects and methods: specimens were collected from 22 patients who visited the preventive dentistry and breath odor clinic of kyushu dental college. a real-time pcr assay using the taqman system, based on the 5'-3' exonuclease activity of taq polymerase, was employed for the quantitative analysis of periodontopathic bacteria that produce vscs. results: using real-time pcr, we performed a quantitative analysis of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, tan. forsythia, and t. denticola in the saliva, on the tongue coat, and in the subgingival plaque of patients with oral malodor. conclusion: real-time pcr using the taqman system  can be used for the quantitative analysis of vsc-producing oral bacteria.

TI  == molecular analysis of microbial diversity in advanced caries.
AB  == real-time pcr analysis of the total bacterial load in advanced carious lesions has shown that the total load exceeds the number of cultivable bacteria. this suggests that an unresolved complexity exists in bacteria associated with advanced caries. in this report, the profile of the microflora of carious dentine was explored by using dna extracted from 10 lesions selected on the basis of comparable total microbial load and on the relative abundance of prevotella spp.  using universal primers for the 16s rrna gene, pcr amplicons were cloned, and approximately 100 transformants were processed for each lesion. phylogenetic analysis of 942 edited sequences demonstrated the presence of 75 species or phylotypes in the 10 carious lesions. up to 31 taxa were represented in each sample. a diverse array of lactobacilli were found to comprise 50% of the species, with prevotellae also abundant, comprising 15% of the species. other taxa present in a number of lesions or occurring with high abundance included selenomonas spp., dialister spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, eubacterium spp., members of the lachnospiraceae family, olsenella spp., bifidobacterium spp., propionibacterium sp., and pseudoramibacter alactolyticus. the mechanisms by which such diverse patterns of bacteria extend carious lesions, including the aspect of infection of the vital dental pulp, remain unclear.

TI  == dna-dna hybridization demonstrates multiple bacteria in osteoradionecrosis.
AB  == bone necrosis secondary to radiation was previously attributed to trauma of devitalized bone and microbiological sepsis. however, conventional microbiological technique has failed to demonstrate microorganisms throughout osteoradionecrotic bone, claimed to be hypoxic, hypovascular and hypocellular. the aim of the present study was to examine such bone for bacteria using dna-dna  hybridization. compared to standard culture methods this technique enables the investigation of a vast number of bacteria in a fairly short time. twelve deep medullary specimens from resected radionecrotic mandibles were studied. a multitude of bacterial species were detected, most of them anaerobic. porphyromonas gingivalis was the most predominant organism, followed by fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies polymorphum. all samples contained actinomyces, prevotella and f. nucleatum. the results of this study indicate that bacteria, particularly anaerobes, may play a more fundamental role in the pathophysiology of osteoradionecrosis than being merely surface contaminants.

TI  == effectiveness of a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice on microbiological and inflammatory parameters.
AB  == according to the us surgeon general's report, "oral health in america," published in 2000, most adults in the united states show some degree of periodontal pathology, with severe periodontal diseases affecting about 14% of middle-aged adults. periodontal diseases are polymicrobial-induced inflammatory diseases, and they vary from mild gingival inflammation to severe deterioration of the periodontium, ie, loss of periodontal supportive tissues and, ultimately, tooth loss. new evidence shows that periodontal diseases may impact systemic health. for this reason, the maintenance of a healthy mouth is becoming increasingly important for the overall health of the body. this article summarizes laboratory  research conducted during the development of a novel, multibenefit, oral-care technology based on triclosan--a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent--and a polyvinylmethylether/maleic acid copolymer. this unique combination of agents is  found in colgate total, a clinically proven efficacious dentifrice for control of dental plaque and gingivitis. data are presented that demonstrate the unique antibacterial properties of this dentifrice: (1) a broad-spectrum antimicrobial profile; (2) the long-lasting retention of triclosan on hydroxyapatite and epithelial cells; and (3) molecular evidence of antibacterial activity against specific pathogens in clinical dental plaque. in addition, data are presented that demonstrate the anti-inflammatory effects of triclosan on specific cytokines, the interruption of inflammatory pathways, and the inhibition of bone  resorption. overall, these data support the multibenefit clinical effects of colgate total and suggest a plurality of mechanisms of action.

TI  == phototoxic effect of visible light on porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium  nucleatum: an in vitro study.
AB  == the antibacterial effect of visible light irradiation combined with photosensitizers has been reported. the objective of this was to test the effect  of visible light irradiation without photosensitizers on the viability of oral microorganisms. strains of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus faecalis in suspension or grown on agar were exposed to visible light at wavelengths of 400-500 nm. these wavelengths are used to photopolymerize composite resins widely used for dental restoration. three photocuring light sources, quartz-tungsten-halogen lamp, light-emitting diode and plasma-arc, at power densities between 260 and 1300 mw/cm2 were used for up to 3 min. bacterial samples were also exposed to a near-infrared diode laser (wavelength, 830 nm), using identical irradiation parameters for comparison. the results show that blue light sources exert a phototoxic effect on p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum. the minimal inhibitory dose for p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum was 16-62 j/cm2, a value significantly lower than that for s. mutans and s. faecalis (159-212 j/cm2). near-infrared diode laser irradiation did not affect any of the bacteria tested. our results suggest that visible light sources without exogenous photosensitizers have a phototoxic effect mainly on gram-negative periodontal pathogens.

TI  == attachment of oral gram-negative anaerobic rods to a smooth titanium surface: an  electron microscopy study.
AB  == purpose: attachment of bacteria to titanium may differ not only between bacterial species but also between strains within a species. the aim of the present in vitro study was to examine differences in bacterial attachment using 4 gram-negative anaerobic species of bacteria that are considered potential periodontal pathogens. materials and methods: the attachment of clinical and laboratory strains (n = 23) representing 2 fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia to smooth, commercially pure  titanium was examined using scanning electron microscopy. results: all bacterial  strains were attached to the smooth titanium surface by their outer membrane. f nucleatum cells were poorly attached to the titanium, unlike p gingivalis or p intermedia cells, but only slight differences were observed in the quantity of attached cells between the strains within each bacterial group. discussion: in favorable conditions, some anaerobes can attach directly to an inert titanium surface. microbial adhesion and subsequent colonization on the dental implant surface can lead to infection of the peri-implant tissue. conclusion: the results indicated that the avidity of bacterial attachment to a smooth titanium surface varies between species of oral gram-negative anaerobes but not between strains.

TI  == differential regulation of cytokine genes in gingival epithelial cells challenged by fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == il-8 mrna in human gingival epithelial cells (hgecs) is up-regulated by fusobacterium nucleatum, and up-/down-regulated by porphyromonas gingivalis in a  complex interaction in the early stages (< or = 4 h) after infection. the mechanisms involved in this regulation in response to f. nucleatum and/or p. gingivalis infection, and identification of co-regulated cytokine genes, are the  focus of this investigation. heat, formalin or protease treatment of f. nucleatum cells attenuated the il-8 mrna up-regulation. nf-kappab, mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) p38 and mapk kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (mek/erk) pathways were involved in il-8 mrna induction by f. nucleatum. pretreatment of p. gingivalis with heat, formalin or protease enhanced il-8 mrna  induction. nf-kappab, mark p38, and mek/erk pathways were also involved in this induction. in contrast, down-regulation of il-8 mrna by p. gingivalis involved mek/erk, but not nf-kappab or mapk p38 pathways. cdna arrays analysis revealed that mrna down-regulation by p. gingivalis is a specific reaction that only a number of genes, e.g. il-1beta, il-8, macrophage inflammatory protein-2alpha, and migration inhibitory factor-related protein-14, are affected based on examination of 278 cytokine/receptor genes. these data indicate that f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis trigger specific and differential gene regulation pathways in hgecs.

TI  == synergy between tannerella forsythia and fusobacterium nucleatum in biofilm formation.
AB  == during dental plaque formation, the interaction of different organisms is important in the development of complex communities. fusobacterium nucleatum is considered a 'bridge-organism' that facilitates colonization of other bacteria by coaggregation-mediated mechanisms and possibly by making the environment conducive for oxygen intolerant anaerobes. these studies were carried out to determine whether coaggregation between f. nucleatum and tannerella forsythia is  important in the formation of mixed species biofilms. further, the role of bspa protein, a surface adhesin of t. forsythia, in coaggregation and biofilm formation was investigated. the results showed the development of synergistic mixed biofilms of f. nucleatum and t. forsythia when these bacteria were cocultured. the bspa protein was not involved in biofilm formation. though bspa plays a role in coaggregation with f. nucleatum, presumably other adhesins are also involved. the synergistic biofilm formation between the two species was dependent on cell-cell contact and soluble components of the bacteria were not required. this study demonstrates that there is a positive synergy between f. nucleatum and t. forsythia in the development of mixed biofilms and that the cell-cell interaction is essential for this phenomenon.

TI  == the aetiology and treatment of oral halitosis: an update.
AB  == halitosis refers to the condition of offensive mouth odour. more than 90% of cases of halitosis originate from the oral cavity. the implicated bacteria (fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, and tannerella forsythensis) are located in stagnant areas in the oral cavity, such as the dorsal surface of tongue, periodontal pockets, and interproximal areas. these bacteria proteolyse the amino acids releasing volatile sulphur compounds. the management of halitosis involves determining and eliminating the causes, which includes identifying any contributory factors, because certain medical conditions are also associated with characteristic smells. professional advice should be given on oral hygiene and diet, and treatments should include dental scaling, and root planing of the associated periodontal pockets to reduce the bacterial loading. in addition to the normal oral hygiene practice, tongue cleaning and use of mouthwash are advocated. this paper discusses the common aetiological factors, classification of oral halitosis, and its treatment.

TI  == periimplantitis.
AB  == orodental rehabilitation through the use of implants offers very high success rates. in this paper, we describe some of the complications involved with this technique, such as periimplant disease and, within this category, periimplantitis, an inflammatory reaction in which there is a loss of the bony support of the implant accompanied by inflammation. the aetiology of the disease  is conditioned by the status of the tissue surrounding the implant, implant design, degree of roughness, the poor alignment of implant components, external morphology and excessive mechanical load. the microorganisms most commonly associated with implant failure are spirochetes and mobile forms of gram-negative anaerobes, unless the origin is the result of simple mechanical overload. diagnosis is based on changes of colour in the gum, bleeding and probing depth of periimplant pockets, suppuration, x-ray and gradual loss of bone height around the tooth. treatment will differ depending upon whether it is a case of mucositis or periimplantitis. therapeutic objectives focus on correcting technical defects  by means of surgery and decontamination techniques (abrasion with carbon particles, citric acid solution, topical tetracycline application and laser surgery). this study also presents a microbiological study of periimplantitis conducted by the barcelona school of dentistry that determined that the antibiotic therapy proven to be most efficacious in the antibiogram was the association of amoxycillin and clavulanic acid.

AB  == the participation of bacterial biofilms in the over-filled gutta-percha points associated with refractory periapical periodontitis has recently been reported. this study investigated the initial biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia) on gutta-percha points in vitro. each bacterial strain was suspended in 100% cell culture medium or in culture medium containing 4.5, 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the bacterial suspensions were then co-incubated anaerobically with gutta-percha  points for 7 d. the gutta-percha points were processed for scanning electron microscopic observation and examined for biofilm presence and thickness. e. faecalis, strep. sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus biofilms were generated on the surfaces of the specimens incubated in culture medium supplemented with 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the e. faecalis and strep. sanguis biofilms were significantly thicker than those of strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus. no biofilms were detected on the specimens incubated with f. nucleatum, prop. acnes, porph. gingivalis and prev. intermedia. these findings suggest that gram-positive facultative anaerobes have the ability  to colonize and form extracellular matrices on gutta-percha points, while serum plays a crucial role in biofilm formation.

TI  == microbiological evaluation of endodontic files after cleaning and steam sterilization procedures.
AB  == background: infection control procedures are essential for modern dental practice and they are continually evolving to meet the dental profession's high standards. the present study evaluated the efficacy of two cleaning procedures to reduce bacterial numbers on endodontic files, and evaluated the effect of biological debris on the subsequent sterilization of files. methods: stainless steel and nickel-titanium (niti) files were examined upon removal from the manufacturer's packaging, after instrumentation in root canals of human teeth inoculated with a  broth containing two anaerobic species and one facultative anaerobic species of bacteria, and after instrumentation and cleaning with either an ultrasonic bath or a thermal disinfector. for each file, the bacterial numbers were quantified using routine microbiological techniques in an anaerobic chamber. results: no bacteria were detected from files direct from their packets. the size, taper and  type of file did not affect the ability of either of the cleaning procedures to reduce bacterial numbers. however, an absence of bacteria was more likely when files were cleaned in the thermal disinfector. no bacteria were detected from files that were-subjected to steam sterilization irrespective of the type of prior cleaning procedure. conclusions: steam sterilization eliminated all bacteria from the endodontic files irrespective of the presence of biological debris. the majority of bacteria were eliminated from endodontic files after either ultrasonic cleaning or using a thermal disinfector.

TI  == periodontal pathogens in atheromatous plaques. a controlled clinical and laboratory trial.
AB  == objective: a possible relationship between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease has been suggested. the aims of this controlled clinical study were: (i)  to ascertain the presence of periodontal bacteria dna [actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis (formerly bacteroides forsythus)]  in carotid atheromatous plaques and (ii) to assess the concomitant presence of the same periodontal bacteria dna, if any, in periodontal pockets and in carotid  atheroma in the same patient. methods: a total of 52 patients scheduled for carotid endarderectomy were enrolled in this study. the test group consisted of 26 dentate patients; the control group included 26 edentulous patients. a complete periodontal examination, including radiographic orthopanoramic and subgingival plaque sample, was performed in the test population. oral and x-ray examinations were performed in the control group. atheromatous plaques were harvested during surgical procedure for each dentate and edentulous patient and then sent to the microbiological laboratory. subgingival plaque samples and carotid specimens were examined using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technique by means of specific primers for periodontal bacteria. amplification of extracted dna was tested using human beta-globin specific-primers. results: out of 52 endarterectomy samples, 12 (seven dentate, five edentulous patients) were excluded as negative to dna amplification. in subgingival plaque samples of 19 test patients, t. forsythensis (79%), f. nucleatum (63%), p. intermedia (53%), p. gingivalis (37%) and a. actinomycetemcomitans (5%) were found. no periodontal bacteria dna was detected by pcr in any of the carotid samples in either patient  group. conclusion: the presence of periodontal bacteria dna in atheromatous plaques could not be confirmed by this study and thus no correlation could be established between species associated with periodontal disease and putative bacteria contributing to atheromatous plaques.

TI  == beta-lactamase production and antimicrobial susceptibility of subgingival bacteria from refractory periodontitis.
AB  == this study assessed the extent of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in subgingival plaque samples obtained from 25 patients with refractory marginal periodontitis in the usa. beta-lactamase-positive isolates were characterized using commercial diagnostic kits and partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. the susceptibilities to different antimicrobial agents were tested and, in addition,  the isolates were screened for the presence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases  (esbls). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were detected in 18 (72%) patients. the most prominent beta-lactamase-producing organisms belonged to the anaerobic genus prevotella. other enzyme-producing anaerobic strains were fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes and peptostreptococcus sp. facultative bacteria, such as burkholderia spp., ralstonia pickettii, capnocytophaga spp., bacillus spp., staphylococcus spp. and neisseria sp., were also detected among the enzyme-producers. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ampicillin and  amoxicillin were in the range 1.5-256 micrograms/ml and 4-256 micrograms/ml, respectively, for the isolates of the prevotella species. all prevotella isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate and metronidazole, but they showed variable resistance to tetracyclines. two of the prevotella isolates had high mics of cefotaxime and ceftazidime. esbl activity was not detected in any of the  beta-lactamase-producing isolates by the etest method. thus, our study demonstrated a wide variety of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria that may play a  role in refractory periodontal disease.

TI  == implant therapy following liver transplantation: clinical and microbiological results after 10 years.
AB  == background: the number of immunocompromised patients is increasing as a consequence of successful organ transplantation. placing dental implants in these patients has been questioned because of their increased risk for infections. the  10-year follow-up data of a 71-year-old liver transplant recipient with long-term immunosuppressive therapy is reported. six months after liver transplantation, two interforaminal implants were inserted in the edentulous mandible, and an overdenture using non-rigid telescopic attachments was fabricated 3 months later. methods: oral clinical parameters included the modified plaque index, sulcus fluid flow rate, modified bleeding index, probing depth, distance implant mucosa, attachment level, width of the keratinized mucosa and mobility values. the distance implant bone (dib) was determined on digital panoramic radiographs. the  levels of eight periodontal marker organisms were established using dna probe technology. additionally, swabs of the edentulous oral mucosa were taken for microbiological culture and antimicrobial resistance testing. results: the peri-implant parameters were within normal ranges indicating a stable osseointegration with moderate vertical bone loss. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis, campylobacter rectus, and treponema denticola were not detected. low levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and eikenella corrodens were found. prevotella intermedia was the only bacterium with a level higher than 10(4). the mucosal swabs indicated the presence of an abundant normal oral flora, including escherichia coli and candida albicans. the antibiogram revealed multiple resistance to antibiotics. conclusion: this case report suggests that immunocompromised patients can be successfully rehabilitated with dental implants.

TI  == [purification and characterization of sanguicin--a bacteriocin produced by streptococcus sanguis].
AB  == objective: streptococcus sanguis plays an important role in maintaining the periodontal microecological balance. previous studies have demonstrated that sanguicin--a kind of bacteriocin produced by s. sanguis has a prominent function  of inhibiting the growth of putative periodontopathic bacteria (ppb). the aim of  this study was to purify sanguicin and investigate its characters. methods: the raw extract of sanguicin was obtained from cells of s. sanguis by ultrasonication, salting out and dialysis. then the diethyl-aminoethyl-sepharose  gradual washing was done in conjunction with glucosan gel filtration for in the purfication of sanguicin. the characters of purified sanguicin were determined and its inhibitiory effect on ppb was measured by agar diffusion test. results: the purifed sanguicin was obtained; it was heat labile and proteinaceous; and by  sds-page, it showed a main band with the relative molecular mass of 65 x 10(3). the purifed sanguicin had a strong inhibitory effect on p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum in vitro. conclusion: our methods are useful for the  purification of sanguicin. sanguicin has inhibitory effect on ppb obviously and will have a good prospect in periodontal ecological therapy.

TI  == subgingival microbiota of chilean patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: an association between race/ethnicity and the composition of the subgingival microbiota has been found in chronic periodontitis. a study was undertaken to determine the characteristics of the subgingival microbiota of chronic periodontitis in chileans residing in santiago. methods: twenty-six subjects (mean age 45 +/- 7 years) with chronic periodontitis, mean probing depth (pd) 2.63 +/- 0.5 mm, mean attachment level (al) 3.70 +/- 0.77 mm, and without a  history of periodontal therapy were selected. measurements of pd, al, bleeding on probing, and plaque accumulation were recorded at six sites per tooth. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of every tooth and evaluated for the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the microbial data of the chileans were compared with data from 115 chronic periodontitis patients from boston, massachusetts. since several clinical and demographic parameters differed between the two populations, significance of differences for  each species was determined using analysis of covariance, adjusting for age, plaque level, mean pd, gender, and smoking status. results: each of the individual test species was present in at least 25 of the 26 subjects, and 12 subjects (46.1%) harbored all 40 test species. with the exception of prevotella intermedia, all test species colonized more than 75% of sites, and 25 species colonized > or = 90% of sites including the co-colonizing species of advanced periodontal lesions, termed the red complex, composed of the three species porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis (formerly bacteroides forsythus), and treponema denticola as well as fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, campylobacter rectus, peptostreptococcus micros, and treponerma socranskii. sixteen of the 40 species differed significantly between chilean and  u.s. subjects. red, yellow, and other complexes were significantly higher in the  chileans, while the actinomyces were higher in the u.s. subjects. conclusions: the composition of the subgingival plaque differs among different subject populations. thus, care should be taken when extrapolating the findings of one study to different ethnic groups.

TI  == effect of supragingival plaque control on subgingival microflora and gingivo-periodontal tissues.
AB  == the aim of this study was to carry out a short term evaluation of the effect of supragingival plaque control on the subgingival microflora and gingivoperiodontal tissues in patients with moderate and severe periodontitis. a total of 92 sites from 23 patients were studied; patients ranged between 35 and 60 years of age (x  46.4 +/- 1.71). plaque index (pi), gingival index (gi), bleeding on probing (bp), probing depth (pd), and attachment level (al) were measured. subgingival microflora of the same sites was studied by dark field microscopy, and cultures in non-selective and selective media for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (pi/n), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) and  fusobacterium nucleatum (fn). the patients were included in a supragingival plaque control program which included oral hygiene training and assessment, and professional control of supragingival plaque and calculus. after 28 days, measurement of clinical parameters and the microbiological study were repeated. the sites were divided according to baseline pd values into: group 1 (5 mm), group 2 (6 mm) and group 3 (> or = 7 mm). results revealed a significant reduction in pi scores, gi scores, pb and pd in groups 2 and 3. no significant difference in al was observed in any of the three groups. pi scores were found to decrease significantly in group 1, and gi scores, bp and pd tended to decrease. a significant increase in coccoid cells and a significant decrease in motile rods and spirochetes, both small and total, was observed in groups 2 and 3. group 1 showed a significant decrease in medium and total spirochetes. at the end of the  study, a significant decrease in pi/n was found in all three groups. significant  decreases were found in pg and fn in groups 3 and 2 respectively. although it holds true that supragingival plaque control reduced a potentially pathogenic subgingival microbiota, this effect was not sufficient to be compatible with healthy gingivoperiodontal tissues.

TI  == modulation of the antibody response by porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum in a mouse model.
AB  == successive immunization of mice with fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis has been shown to modulate the specific serum igg responses to these organisms. the aim of this study was to investigate these antibody responses further by examining the igg subclasses induced as well as the opsonizing properties of the specific antibodies. serum samples from balb/c mice immunized with f. nucleatum (gp1-f), p. gingivalis (gp2-p), p. gingivalis followed by f. nucleatum (gp3-pf) f. nucleatum followed by p. gingivalis (gp4-fp) or saline alone (gp5-s) were examined for specific igg1 (th2) and igg2a (th1) antibody levels using an elisa and the opsonizing properties measured using a neutrophil chemiluminescence assay. while igg1 and igg2a subclasses were induced in all immunized groups, there was a tendency towards an igg1 response in mice immunized with p. gingivalis alone, while immunization with f. nucleatum followed by p. gingivalis induced significantly higher anti-p. gingivalis igg2a levels than igg1. the maximum light output due to neutrophil phagocytosis of p. gingivalis occurred at 10 min using nonopsonized bacteria. chemiluminescence was reduced using serum-opsonized p. gingivalis and, in particular, sera from p. gingivalis-immunized mice (gp2-p), with maximum responses occurring at 40 min. in contrast, phagocytosis of immune serum-opsonized f. nucleatum demonstrated peak light output at 10 min, while that of f. nucleatum opsonized with sera from saline injected mice (gp5-s) and control nonopsonized bacteria showed peak responses at 40 min. the lowest phagocytic response occurred using gp4-fp serum-opsonized f. nucleatum. in conclusion, the results of the present study have demonstrated a systemic th1/th2 response in mice immunized with p. gingivalis and/or f. nucleatum with a trend towards a th2 response in p. gingivalis-immunized mice and a significantly increased anti-p. gingivalis igg2a  (th1) response in mice immunized with f. nucleatum prior to p. gingivalis. further, the inhibition of neutrophil phagocytosis of immune serum-opsonized p. gingivalis was modulated by the presence of anti-f. nucleatum antibodies, while anti-p. gingivalis antibodies induced an inhibitory effect on the phagocytic response to f. nucleatum.

TI  == apical periodontitis development and bacterial response to endodontic treatment.  experimental root canal infections in monkeys with selected bacterial strains.
AB  == in six monkeys, 160 root canals were inoculated with a combination of four bacterial strains belonging to species streptococcus milleri, peptostreptococcus  anaerobius, prevotella oralis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. in two other monkeys, 24 root canals were inoculated with a five-strain combination consisting of these strains and a strain of enterococcus faecalis. all strains were previously isolated from an infected monkey root canal. after 8-12 months, survival of the strains was recorded bacteriologically, and the reaction in the periapical region was radiographed. from 180 of 184 root canals, one or more of the bacterial strains were reisolated. the two facultative strains were more frequently reisolated than the anaerobic strains. apical periodontitis was registered in the periapical region of more than 96% of root canals with reisolated bacteria but in none of those without reisolated bacteria. endodontic treatment was carried out in two sessions with an interval of 14 d without interappointment dressings, and  the effect was evaluated bacteriologically before and after each treatment. the chemo-mechanical treatment reduced significantly the number of strains and bacterial cells. the facultative bacteria were more resistant to the treatment than the anaerobic bacteria. the five-strain combination had a higher survival rate than the four-strain combination.

TI  == the role of lipopolysaccharide in infectious bone resorption of periapical lesion.
AB  == background: the role of lipopolysaccharide (lps) in periapical lesion-induced bone resorption was investigated. polymyxin b (pmb), a specific inhibitor of lps, was evaluated to treat the apical lesion. methods: lipopolysaccharide isolated from two common endodontic pathogens, fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas endodontalis, stimulated mouse macrophage (j774) to release interleukin-1alpha (il-1 alpha) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) in a time-dependent manner. results: combination of lps further enhanced the stimulation. pmb inhibited these effects significantly. lps also stimulated matrix metalloproteinase-1 (mmp-1) gene expression in j774, whereas anti-il-1 alpha and  anti-tnf-alpha antibodies, as well as pmb, diminished this effect. a disease model of periapical lesion was established in wistar rat. administration of pmb reduced the extent of lesion-associated bone resorption by 76% to approximately 80%, and simultaneously reduced the numbers of mmp-1-producing macrophages. conclusions: it is suggested that lps released from the infected root canal triggers the synthesis of il-1 alpha and tnf-alpha from macrophages. these pro-inflammatory cytokines up-regulate the production of mmp-1 by macrophages to  promote periapical bone resorption.

TI  == induction of calprotectin release by porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide  in human neutrophils.
AB  == calprotectin, a major cytosolic protein of leukocytes, is detected in neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and epithelial cells. this protein is known to be a marker for several inflammatory diseases and is detected in inflammatory  gingival tissue with periodontal disease. recently, we found that the calprotectin level in gingival crevicular fluid from periodontitis patients was significantly higher than that of healthy subjects. however, the regulation of calprotectin in periodontal disease is unclear. in the present study, we investigated the effect of lipopolysaccharides of periodontopathic bacteria on calprotectin release from human neutrophils. neutrophils from healthy donors were treated with lipopolysaccharides from porphyromonas gingivalis (p-lps), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and escherichia coli. calprotectin of neutrophil was identified by immunoblotting and calprotectin amount was determined by elisa. two subunits (10  and 14 kda) of calprotectin were observed in the cell and medium fractions from neutrophils. p-lps increased calprotectin release from seven to 16 times the control level after 30 min and its effect appeared in a dose-dependent manner (10-1000 ng/ml). lipopolysaccharides from a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, and e. coli also induced calprotectin release from neutrophils. these results suggest that lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria induce calprotectin release from human neutrophils.

TI  == relationship between tongue coating and secretory-immunoglobulin a level in saliva obtained from patients complaining of oral malodor.
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to confirm the relationships between oral malodor  and periodontal condition, oral malodor and tongue coating, and to investigate the secretory-immunoglobulin a (s-iga) level in saliva in relation to the accumulation of tongue coating. methods: fifty-four patients complaining of oral  malodor were included in the study. their periodontal conditions, tongue coating  status and salivary characteristics (flow rate, protein and s-iga concentrations) were assessed in addition to the level of volatile sulfur compounds (vsc) in oral cavity. the patients were divided into three groups according to their tongue coating level. results: there are significant relationships between oral malodor  and specific periodontal parameters used. the degree of tongue coating was also significantly correlated with the amount of h2s, ch3sh and the total amount of vsc determined. the concentration of s-iga in the group identified as slight tongue coating was significantly higher than in the moderate or the severe group. by western immunoblotting analysis, a high level of s-iga specific to streptococcus species was recognized in all groups, whereas the reactivity of porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum with s-iga was very weak in  both the slight and the moderate groups. conclusion: data herein indicate that tongue coating is closely related to oral malodor. furthermore, s-iga in saliva may influence the accumulation of tongue coating, and s-iga antibodies directed to streptococcus species may play a role in protective immunity against the initial colonization of tongue plaque.

AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to determine the subgingival microbiota of hiv-infected patients with chronic periodontitis and different t cd4 lymphocyte levels under haart. study design: 64 hiv+ patients (mean age 34.5 +/- 7.3; 75% males) were distributed into group i: chronic periodontitis (> or = 3 sites with  probing pocket depth (ppd) and/or clinical attachment level (cal) > or = 5 mm); and group ii: periodontal health (no sites with ppd > 3 mm and/or cal > 4 mm). all subjects received conventional periodontal therapy. periodontal clinical parameters were evaluated at 6 sites/tooth in all teeth at baseline and 4 months  after therapy. the levels of t cd4 were obtained from the patient's medical record. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the 6 sites with the largest pocket depth in each subject of group i, and 6 randomly selected sites in subjects of group ii. the presence of 22 subgingival species was determined using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. significant microbiological differences within and among groups were sought using wilcoxon signed-rank and mann-whitney tests, respectively. relationships between t cd4 levels and microbiological parameters were determined using kruskal-wallis test. results: sixty-one percent of the hiv-infected patients represented aids cases, although 69% of them were periodontally healthy. the t cd4 lymphocyte mean level was 333 cells/mm3 and viral load was 12,815 +/- 24,607 copies/mm3. yet, the prevalence of chronic periodontitis was relatively low (36%). several periodontal pathogens, in particular t. forsythensis (p < .05), were more prevalent in hiv-positive patients with periodontitis than in hiv-positive subjects with periodontal health. most of the species decreased in frequency after therapy, particularly p. gingivalis (p < .05). e. faecalis and f. nucleatum were significantly more prevalent in the subgingival microbiota of patients with chronic periodontitis and lower levels of t cd4 (p < .05), while beneficial species tended to be more frequently detected in individuals with t cd4 counts over 500 cells/mm3. conclusion: the subgingival microbiota of hiv-infected patients with chronic periodontitis include a high prevalence of classical periodontal pathogens observed in non-infected individuals. furthermore, the severe immunosuppression seems to favor the colonization by these species, as well as by species not commonly found in the subgingival microbiota.

TI  == microbiological examination of infected dental root canals.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to investigate the root canal microbiota of primary and secondary root-infected canals and the association of constituent species with specific endodontic signs and symptoms. methods: microbial samples were taken from 60 root canals, 41 with necrotic pulp tissues (primary infection) and 19 with failed endodontic treatment (secondary infection). strict anaerobic techniques were used for serial dilution, plating, incubation and identification. results: a total of 224 cultivable isolates were recovered belonging to 56 different bacterial species. individual root canals yielded a maximum of 10 bacterial species. of the bacterial isolates, 70% were either strict anaerobes or microphilic. the anaerobes most frequently isolated were: peptostreptococcus micros (35%), fusobacterium necrophorum (23.3%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.7%), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (16.7%), porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%) and porphyromonas endodontalis (5%). the root canal microflora of untreated teeth with apical periodontitis was found to be mixed, comprising gram-negative and gram-positive and mostly anaerobic microorganisms and usually containing more than 3 species per canal. on the other hand, facultative anaerobic and gram-positive bacteria predominated in canals with failed endodontic treatment, which harbored 1-2 species per canal. suggested relationships were found between  anaerobes, especially gram-negatives, and the presence or history of pain, tenderness to percussion and swelling (p<0.05). in particular, associations were  found between: a) pain (n=29) and p. micros (p<0.01), p. intermedia/nigrescens and eubacterium spp. (both p<0.05); b) history of pain (n=31) and p. micros (p<0.01) porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); c) tenderness to percussion (n=29) and porphyromonas spp. (p<0.01), peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.001); d) swelling (n=20) and peptostreptococcus spp. (p<0.01), porphyromonas and enterococcus spp. (p<0.05); e) wet canals (n=33) and  porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); f) purulent exudate (n=20) and porphyromonas, peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); previous endodontic treatment and enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus spp., p. micros, f. necrophorum (p<0.05). conclusions: our findings indicate potential complex interactions of species resulting in characteristic clinical pictures which cannot be achieved by individual species alone. they also indicate that the microbiota of primary infected canals with apical periodontitis differs in number and in species from the secondary infected canals by using the culture technique.

TI  == effect of porphyromonas gingivalis vesicles on coaggregation of staphylococcus aureus to oral microorganisms.
AB  == vesicles from the outer membrane of porphyromonas gingivalis have the ability to  aggregate a wide range of streptococcus spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces naeslundii, and actinomyces viscosus. we found that in the presence of p. gingivalis vesicles, staphylococcus aureus coaggregated with streptococcus  spp., and the mycelium-type candida albicans, but not the yeast type. autoaggregation of s. aureus in the presence of p. gingivalis vesicles is inhibited by l-arginine, l-lysine, and l-cysteine. both the methicillin-sensitive (mssa) and -resistant (mrsa) strains of s. aureus were able to coaggregate with streptococcus spp., a. naeslundii, and a. viscosus when they were treated with p. gingivalis vesicles. p. gingivalis vesicle-treated mycelium-type c. albicans coaggregated with s. aureus, but the yeast-type did not. these results indicate that strains of s. aureus, including mrsa, could adhere to oral biofilms in dental plaque on the tooth surface or in the gingival crevice when p. gingivalis  is present.

TI  == detection of subgingival calculus and dentine caries by laser fluorescence.
AB  == objectives: detection of subgingival calculus and dentine caries in the bottom of deep periodontal pockets is often difficult without visual observation. we thus examined the possibility of its detection using autofluorescence induced by laser irritation. methods: autofluorescence was measured at various excitation and emission wavelength settings in five specimens each of sound dentine and enamel,  subgingival calculus, and root caries. periodontopathic model teeth with bacterial cells and blood clots were also irritated by laser to obtain autofluorescent images. results: subgingival calculus and dentine caries showed a characteristic 700 nm emission when excited at 635 nm or a 720 nm emission when excited at 655 nm; sound dentine or enamel, however, did not. the calculus differentiation power, however, was higher with excitation at 635 nm than at 655  nm. the autofluorescent images photographed at an excitation of 633 nm provided clear calculus identification in periodontopathic model teeth when a 700 nm band-pass filter or a 700 nm high-pass filter was used. however, fluorescence intensity was masked when the calculus surface was covered by bacterial cells or  blood clots. for clinical use, it would be important to remove subgingival plaque and debris from root surfaces before attempting to detect subgingival calculus and root caries with this manner. conclusion: the autofluorescence method employing excitation of 633-635 nm was found to be a powerful tool for detecting  subgingival calculus and root caries.

TI  == a comparison of the antibacterial efficacies of essential oils against oral pathogens.
AB  == cariogenic bacteria and periodontopathic bacteria are present in dental plaque as biofilms. in this study, we investigated the antibacterial effects of essential oils on the following oral bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus. we tested manuka oil, tea tree oil, eucalyptus oil, lavandula oil, and romarinus oil and determined their minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration. the essential oils inhibited the growth of the bacteria tested, manuka oil being the most effective. minimum bactericidal concentration values showed that lavandula oil acts bacteriostatically, and the remaining oils, bactericidally. periodontopathic bacterial strains tested were killed completely by exposure for 30 s to 0.2% manuka oil, tea tree oil or eucalyptus oil. tea tree oil and manuka oil showed significant adhesion-inhibiting activity against p. gingivalis. all the essential oils tested inhibited the adhesion of s. mutans. this study showed that, among the essential oils tested, manuka oil and tea tree oil in particular had strong antibacterial activity against periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria. from the viewpoint of safety, we also examined the effects of these essential oils on cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells and found that, at a concentration of 0.2%, they had little effect on cultured cells.

TI  == antagonistic interactions among fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia with oral lactobacilli.
AB  == microbiota residing in oral ecosystems show great complexity because of the mutual interdependence of certain microorganisms that might influence their presence or absence at a given site. the aim of this work was to evaluate possible antagonistic interactions among fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia, isolated from periodontal pockets, and lactobacillus casei, l. salivarius, l. rhamnosus and l. plantarum isolated from saliva. different tests were carried out using each strain as an effector as well as a sensitive strain,  alternatively: (1) agar diffusion with paper disks embedded with supernatants and pellets in different culture media; (b) the well diffusion assay; (c) the double  layer method; and (d) od(560) measurements of the kinetic growth of lactobacillus strains in laptg broth with different volumes of f. nucleatum supernatant. p. intermedia supernatant did not have an inhibitory effect on lactobacillus growth, except for l. casei, when the double plaque method was used. f. nucleatum supernatant inhibited growth of all lactobacillus strains when the well diffusion method was used. f. nucleatum inhibited l. casei growth whatever the method used. the substance responsible for inhibition was a thermoresistant extracellular protein which was hydrolyzed by trypsin-like proteases. none of the species of lactobacilli studied inhibited the growth of p. intermedia or f. nucleatum.

TI  == intracellular production and extracellular release of oxygen radicals by pmns and oxidative stress on pmns during phagocytosis of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == in this study we investigated intracellular and extracellular oxygen radical production by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns) during the phagocytosis of periodontopathic bacteria. in in vitro assays, bacteria of the species porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and fusobacterium nucleatum were phagocytosed at 37 degrees c for 4 h by purified peripheral human  pmns from healthy subjects (n = 6). superoxide production during phagocytosis was determined by flow cytometry and with a fluorescence/luminescence microplate reader. after phagocytosis, oxidative stress was determined by flow cytometry. both the intracellular and extracellular oxygen radical production by pmns phagocytosing f. nucleatum was significantly greater than that of pmns phagocytosing p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans ( p < 0.01 by the mann-whitney test). moreover, after 4 h of incubation, the oxidative stress of pmns phagocytosing f. nucleatum was significantly greater than that of pmns phagocytosing p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. we conclude that a high level of superoxide production by pmns may damage not only periodontopathic bacteria but also pmns themselves, and may be correlated with the destruction of  periodontal tissue.

TI  == coaggregation of streptococcus salivarius with periodontopathogens: evidence for  involvement of fimbriae in the interaction with prevotella intermedia.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius is divided into two serological subgroups that carry either fibrils or fimbriae. although fimbriae have been observed on up to 50% of  s. salivarius strains in the human oral cavity, no function has yet been assigned to them. to determine whether s. salivarius fimbriae have a role in adhesion, we  examined the ability of s. salivarius to coaggregate with selected microorganisms involved in periodontal diseases. our results show that s. salivarius coaggregated with fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia. however, only fimbriated s. salivarius cells were able to  coaggregate with p. intermedia, suggesting a specific role for these structures in the interaction. heat treatment, sensitivity to sugars, amino acids, and edta, as well as protease treatment were also used to further characterize coaggregation between s. salivarius and periodontopathogens.

TI  == bacteria-binding plasma proteins in pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite in vitro and on teeth in vivo.
AB  == previous studies on dental pellicle formation and bacterial adherence have focussed on saliva and its components. the tooth surface is, however, also exposed to the plasma-derived crevicular fluid. in the present study, (i). plasma proteins in in vitro and in vivo pellicles were examined using sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page), immunoblotting and image  analysis and (ii). the adherence of periodontopathogenic bacteria to experimental plasma and saliva pellicles was examined using radio-labelled bacteria and liquid scintillation counting. the plasma components fibrinogen, fibronectin, albumin and igg were incorporated from plasma in the experimental pellicle and mediated the adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces naeslundii. these proteins were also readily detected in in vivo pellicles and were found to a higher extent in pellicles formed at the gingival part of the tooth surface than at the incisal part.

TI  == genomics of oral bacteria.
AB  == advances in bacterial genetics came with the discovery of the genetic code, followed by the development of recombinant dna technologies. now the field is undergoing a new revolution because of investigators' ability to sequence and assemble complete bacterial genomes. over 200 genome projects have been completed or are in progress, and the oral microbiology research community has benefited through projects for oral bacteria and their non-oral-pathogen relatives. this review describes features of several oral bacterial genomes, and emphasizes the themes of species relationships, comparative genomics, and lateral gene transfer. genomics is having a broad impact on basic research in microbial pathogenesis, and will lead to new approaches in clinical research and therapeutics. the oral microbiota is a unique community especially suited for new challenges to sequence the metagenomes of microbial consortia, and the genomes of uncultivable bacteria.

TI  == subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.
AB  == little information is available on the effect of miswak use on gingival microbiota. we assessed levels of 28 oral bacteria in subgingival plaque of adult sudanese miswak (n = 38) and toothbrush users (n = 36) age range 20-53 years (mean 34.6 years) to study associations between these bacteria, oral hygiene method, and periodontal status at the sampled sites. a pooled subgingival plaque  sample from 6 probing sites of 1 selected tooth in each jaw was obtained from each subject. whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization were used in assessing 74 pooled samples. using 10(5) bacterial cells threshold,  between 2.6% and 47.4% of miswak users and between 2.8% and 36.1% of toothbrush users harbored the investigated species. the percentages of subjects with the investigated species at 10(6) bacterial cells varied between 2.6% and 39.5% in miswak and between 2.8% and 36.1% in toothbrush users. miswak users harbored significantly higher streptococcus intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, veillonella parvula, actinomyces israelii, and capnocytophaga gingivalis, and significantly lower selenomonas sputigena, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, and streptococcus oralis than did toothbrush users. probing pocket depth > or = 6 mm showed significantly (p <  0.05) higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and v. parvula than those 4-5 mm. our results indicate that the type of oral hygiene had a significant effect on levels of 11 out of 28 bacterial species, and that the type of effect was also dependent on type of bacteria and probing pocket depth.

TI  == evaluation of antibacterial activity of mangifera indica on anaerobic dental microglora based on in vivo studies.
AB  == the present study was carried out to compare the subgingival plaque microflora in mango leaf users. fifty subjects of both sexes, 25 of them used tooth brush and 25 used mango leaf as their home care hygiene device were included in the study.  the microbiological evaluation for specific bacterial counts of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus micros were carried out for all subject. specific microbial evaluation revealed significant decrease in the proportion of p. intermedia and p. gingivalis in mango leaf users compared to tooth brush users. it shows that mangiferin possesses antibacterial activity in vivo against specific periodontal pathogens such as p. intermedia and p. gingivalis. use of mango leaf in conjunction with a tooth brush will be a good home care device for maintenance of oral hygiene.

TI  == additive antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide and chlorhexidine on common  endodontic bacterial pathogens.
AB  == it is an established procedure to use calcium hydroxide [ca(oh)2] as a therapeutic component to achieve sterilization of infected root canals. unfortunately, some bacterial species are relatively resistant to ca(oh)2 and are therefore associated with treatment failures. the objective of this study was to  identify combinations of substances that improve antimicrobial activity. ca(oh)2  was used as a suspension or as a component of gutta-percha points. efficacy of killing was compared for (a) ca(oh)2 suspension alone; (b) zinc oxide (zno) points alone; (c) ca(oh)2 suspension combined with zno points; (d) ca(oh)2 suspension combined with zno/chlorhexidine points; and (e) ca(oh)2 points combined with zno/chlorhexidine points. common endodontopathogenic bacterial species (enterococcus faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus intermedius) in pure cultures served as target organisms. in the in vitro assay, the antibacterial substances and approximately 10(7) colony forming units of test bacteria were co-incubated in diluted human serum under growth conditions appropriate for the single bacterial species. samples were taken on days 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 of incubation and viable counts determined. gram-negative bacteria were sufficiently killed by  ca(oh)2 alone. combinations with other agents did not improve the killing kinetics. for the inactivation of the gram-positive bacteria p. micros and s. intermedius, a combination of ca(oh)2 and zno/chlorhexidine, killed the bacteria  faster than ca(oh)2 alone. for e. faecalis, combining ca(oh)2 suspension with zno/chlorhexidine points lead to a faster decrease in the overall number of viable bacteria, but no test conditions lead to the complete loss of culture viability. the results of this study support the use of a combination of ca(oh)2  and chlorhexidine for faster eradication of p. micros and s. intermedius from infected root canals.

TI  == the effects of a new mouthrinse containing chlorhexidine, cetylpyridinium chloride and zinc lactate on the microflora of oral halitosis patients: a dual-centre, double-blind placebo-controlled study.
AB  == aim: this study evaluated the microbial effects of a newly formulated mouthwash (halita) on oral halitosis patients. methods: forty subjects were included in this dual-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel study. inclusion and  exclusion criteria were used to select patients. at baseline and at 2 weeks post-treatment, full-mouth organoleptic odor scores, level of volatile sulphur compounds (vsc) and the winkel tongue coating index were recorded. standardized samples of tongue coating, saliva and subgingival plaque were microbiologically investigated. participants were randomly assigned to the test or placebo groups.  results: high prevalences were observed for fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and porphyromonas gingivalis in tongue coating, saliva and subgingival plaque samples. a significant positive correlation between baseline total counts  of p. gingivalis in saliva samples and organoleptic and vsc scores was found. two weeks post-treatment there was a reduction in total anaerobic counts in all samples in the test group. a significant positive correlation was observed between the reduction in total counts in saliva samples and the reduction in organoleptic scores in the test group. significant reductions in total counts and proportions of f. nucleatum and total counts of p. intermedia in tongue coating samples were observed in the test group. conclusions: the test mouthwash demonstrated efficacy in reducing the microbiological parameters in three oral niches in moderate to severe halitosis patients without periodontitis, and this was correlated with the improvements in organoleptic and vsc scores but not with  the tongue coating scores.

TI  == ovine periodontitis as a potential model for periodontal studies. cross-sectional analysis of clinical, microbiological, and serum immunological parameters.
AB  == objectives: : to investigate infection and host immunity patterns in sheep with naturally occurring "broken-mouth" periodontitis. materials and methods: : eight  periodontally healthy (hs) and eight periodontally diseased ewes (pds) were selected. subgingival plaque and sera were collected and examined for evidence of human periodontitis-associated pathogens. serum igg titers were measured by elisa to multiple strains of porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, dichelobacter nodosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum as well as several purified antigens (cysteine proteases, lps, k, and fimbriae). results: : neither the organism aa nor antigens to aa were found in any animal. most animals were positive for pg, bf, and pi, but dna probes detected no difference between hs and pds relative to  amounts of pathogens in subgingival plaque. pds had significantly higher serum igg titers to all pg strains, to 50% of bf strains, to the pi and fn strains, and to fimbriae and the two cysteine proteases (p-values ranging from 0.05 to 0.001). regression analysis demonstrated a significant association between number of teeth lost and serum igg antibody titers to whole-cell sonicate antigens of p. gingivalis strains (p<0.01) and body weight (p<0.01). conclusions: : the presence of pathogens associated with periodontitis was reflected in differences in serum  igg titers between healthy and diseased sheep. this may have influenced animal body weight and might have systemic health and economic consequences. the data suggest that susceptible and non-susceptible sheep can be identified for periodontal research.

TI  == an immunohistological study of the localization of bacteria invading root pulpal  walls of teeth with periapical lesions.
AB  == we immunohistologically examined the prevalence and localization of bacteria invading dentinal tubules of the roots of teeth with infected canals. forty extracted teeth with apical lesions were selected and divided into two groups: a  group of untreated teeth and a group of canal-enlarged teeth. the bacteria in the specimens were detected by brown-brenn stain and the labeled-streptavidin-biotin  method with specific antisera for 16-bacteria. seventy percent of the examined teeth showed bacteria invading the dentinal tubules of the roots. fusobacterium nucleatum, eubacterium alactolyticum, e. nodatum, lactobacillus casei, and peptostreptococcus micros were abundant. even in the canal-enlarged group, invasion of bacteria was observed in 65% of teeth. this study revealed the actual condition of bacteria in infected root dentin and suggested that the canal-enlargement procedure could not completely remove all the bacteria in the infected dentinal tubules of the root.

TI  == serum phenytoin concentration and igg antibody titre to periodontal bacteria in patients with phenytoin-induced gingival overgrowth.
AB  == epileptic patients taking phenytoin with gingival-overgrowth and those without gingival-overgrowth were compared for daily drug dose, plasma total phenytoin concentration, plasma free-phenytoin concentration and serum igg antibody titre against 13 periodontal bacteria. significantly higher daily drug dose was noted in patients with gingival overgrowth (p < 0.05) when compared with those without  overgrowth. in addition, both total and free forms of plasma phenytoin concentration were significantly higher in sera of patients with gingival growth  than of those without overgrowth (p < 0.01). strong positive correlation was found between daily drug dose and serum phenytoin concentration in patients with  gingival overgrowth, while weak correlation was found in patients without gingival overgrowth, suggesting a difference in drug metabolism in these two groups. however, no differences were found in serum igg antibody titres to 13 periodontal bacteria examined between two groups. these results suggest that metabolic ability of phenytoin is one of the factors for developing gingival overgrowth, and that periodontal infection may not be a primary causative factor  for gingival overgrowth but act as an additive factor which increase tissue mass  for this unwanted side effect.

TI  == acid-neutralizing activity during amino acid fermentation by porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == acid-neutralizing activity during amino acid fermentation by washed cells of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum was studied. when the washed cells of these strains were anaerobically incubated in the presence of aspartylaspartic acid or glutamylglutamic acid for p. gingivalis, aspartic acid for p. intermedia and glutamic acid for f. nucleatum at an initial  ph of 5.0 or 5.5, the ph of the incubation mixtures rose toward neutral. f. nucleatum had the highest acid-neutralizing activity, followed by p. intermedia and p. gingivalis. the p. intermedia and f. nucleatum cells were used to measure  the amounts of base produced at a fixed ph of 5.0. these cells generated significant amounts of base at ph 5.0 along with the production of organic acids  and ammonia from aspartic or glutamic acid. acid-base balance theoretically calculated from the amounts of consumed substrate and end products implies that the acid-neutralizing activity was derived from the decrease in acidity during the fermentation of amino acid into organic acids and ammonia.

AB  == the aim of the present investigation was to examine the outer-surface microbiota  of the prosthetic connector of frialit-2 implants, and to compare the microbial findings with the peri-implant parameters 2 years after functional loading. in 16 implant-treated patients (55.8 +/- 9.5 years) the outer-surface micro-organisms of the prosthetic connectors were determined in 32 frialit-2 implants. the functional loading time of the prosthetic suprastructures was 24.1 +/- 13.8 months on average. after removal of the implant-supported restoration, microbial  samples were obtained from the outer-surfaces of the frialit-2 prosthetic connector. the microbial plaque samples were specified on cdc-blood agar as percentages of the total cultivable flora. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was semiquantitively determined on tsbv-agar in cfu/ml. the microbial plaque samples were dominated by actinomyces israelii (68.8%), eubacterium lentum (56.3%) and veillonella parvula (43.8%) with proportions ranking between 3.9% (v. parvula) and 11.1% (a. israelii). the most frequently detected gram-negative microorganisms were fusobacterium nucleatum (87.5%), porphyromonas gingivalis (81.3%), and peptostreptococcus micros (68.8%) with enhanced proportions for p. gingivalis (11.4%) and p. micros (11.4%). no statistical significant correlation  could be established between the microbiota present on the outer-surfaces of the  f2-connector and the peri-implant parameters examined. the outer-surface microflora recovered from the implanto-prosthetic-connector of frialit-2 implants reveals a colonization with gram-positive bacteria and potentially harmful gram-negative micro-organisms that were frequently detected, but present at low levels. after 2 years of restorative loading, the outer-surface microbial colonization is compatible with peri-implant soft tissue health.

TI  == isotypic antibody response to plaque anaerobes in periodontal disease.
AB  == background: it has been suggested that locally produced immunoglobulin (ig)a could be more protective than igg and that there could be a relationship between  crevicular fluid-specific iga levels and the onset of periodontal disease. this study was designed to investigate this hypothesis regarding specific immune responses towards 4 plaque anaerobes in gingival crevicular fluid and saliva from patients with periodontopathies and controls. methods: gingival crevicular fluid  (gcf) and whole saliva were collected from 35 adults with periodontitis and 24 periodontally healthy adults (controls). antigens were extracted from actinomyces actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum and used to set up specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) tests to assess iga and igg levels to these microorganisms in the fluids collected. results: the crevicular fluid of periodontitis patients contained significantly higher levels of igg to the 4 microorganisms tested than  that of controls (p < 10(-6) for all comparisons). iga levels to the 4 bacteria were statistically significantly much higher in control crevicular fluid (p < 10(-7) for all comparisons). controls also had statistically significantly higher levels of specific salivary iga than patients (p < 0.02 for all comparisons). conclusions: these data support the potentially protective role of specific iga directed to oral microorganisms involved in the onset and development of periodontal disease.

TI  == igg subclass specific antibody response to periodontopathic organisms in hiv-positive patients.
AB  == background: we previously reported an increased rate of progression of periodontal disease over an 18-month period in human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-positive subjects compared to controls. the mechanism for disease progression and rapid tissue loss was unknown. data on the microbiological studies failed to show any significant difference in the microbial characteristics of the periodontal lesions in hiv-positive patients compared to hiv-negative controls. immunological analysis had identified neutrophils as an important component of the host defense against periodontal infection, especially against rapid tissue loss. serum igg reactivities to periodontal pathogens in hiv-positive patients with periodontitis were reduced. other data provided circumstantial evidence to suggest that igg subclass (igg2) specific antibody might assist bacterial clearing in periodontal infection. the aim of the current  study was to examine the specific igg subclass antibody response to a panel of periodontopathic organisms: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), campylobacter rectus (cr), and bacteroides forsythus (bf) in hiv-positive patients compared to hiv-negative controls. methods: sera from 120 hiv-positive patients (40 periodontitis, 69 gingivitis, and 11 no oral diseases)  were tested for igg subclass specific antibody response to the above listed 6 organisms using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. data were compared with those  obtained from 40 hiv-negative control subjects (35 periodontitis, 2 gingivitis, and 3 no oral diseases). results: in the hiv-positive group, a consistently high  response rate was found in igg1 to all the bacteria tested. in addition, high levels of igg3 and igg4 to pg and igg1 and igg2 to pi were also present. however, no significant difference was detected among the periodontitis, gingivitis, and no oral disease subgroups. when the periodontitis patients from the hiv-positive  group were compared to the hiv-negative group, no difference in the antibody levels and response rates was noted. conclusion: we conclude that in hiv-positive patients, the specific igg subclass antibody response to periodontopathic organisms was similar to that of hiv-negative subjects.

TI  == in vitro effect of laser irradiation on cementum-bound endotoxin isolated from periodontally diseased roots.
AB  == background: in a previous study, we evaluated the in vivo effects of an nd:yag laser on periodontal disease by measuring crevicular interleukin (il)-1beta levels before and after laser application. it was found that laser therapy was less effective than traditional scaling and root planing. these results might be  due to incomplete removal of microbial residues and cementum-bound endotoxin on root surfaces by the laser. in this study, we explored the in vitro effectiveness of an nd:yag laser for the elimination of cementum-bound endotoxin by measuring il-1beta changes in stimulated monocytes. methods: fresh human monocytes were harvested from adults without periodontitis and grown in rpmi 1640 medium. diseased cementum particles were collected and prepared from teeth with untreated periodontitis and were irradiated with 5 levels of laser energy. cementum particles were subjected to endotoxin testing by a limulus amebocyte lysate (lal) assay and then were incubated with cultured monocytes. production of il-1beta in  stimulated monocytes was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantified by spectrophotometry. results: the endotoxin unit (eu) of diseased cementum was 18.4 eu/mg, which seemed to be remarkably lower than that of common  periodontal pathogens including porphyromonas gingivalis (381) at 15,300 eu/mg/ml, prevotella intermedia (atcc 25611) at 227 eu/mg/ml, and fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc 25586) at 1,987 eu/mg/ml. monocytes subjected to stimulation by diseased cementum particles without laser irradiation produced 124 to 145 pg/ml il-1beta, 9- to 18-fold higher than that of unstimulated monocytes (7.07 to 15.95 pg/ml). diseased cementum particles after irradiation with various energy levels  of the nd:yag laser could still stimulate monocytes to secrete 89 to 129 pg/ml il-1beta. no statistically significant difference was found in the production of  il-1beta induced by diseased-bound cementum with or without laser irradiation. conclusions: the nd:yag laser varying from 50 mj, 10 pps to 150 mj, 20 pps, for 2 minutes, did not seem to be effective in destroying diseased cementum endotoxin.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and other putative periodontal pathogens in subjects with and without periodontal destruction.
AB  == background and aims: bacteria play an essential role in the pathogenesis of destructive periodontal disease. it has been suggested that not all bacteria associated with periodontitis may be normal inhabitants of a periodontally healthy dentition. in particular, porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans have been isolated infrequently from subjects without periodontitis. the aim of the present study was to compare prevalence and proportions of a number of periodontal bacteria in periodontitis patients and control subjects. material and methods: in all, 116 consecutive subjects diagnosed with moderate to severe periodontitis (mean age 42.4) and 94 subjects without radiographic evidence of alveolar bone loss (mean age 40.4) were recruited for the study. the gingival condition in the control group varied between gingival health and various degrees of gingivitis. in patients, the deepest pocket in each quadrant was selected for microbiological sampling. in control subjects all mesial and distal sites of all first molars were selected for sampling. all paper points from a patient were pooled and processed for anaerobic cultivation within 6 h after sampling. clinical variables of sampled sites included bleeding index, probing pocket depth and clinical attachment level. results: a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus micros were significantly more often prevalent in patients than in controls. the highest odds ratios were found for p. gingivalis and b. forsythus (12.3 and 10.4 resp.). other odds ratios varied from 3.1 to 7.7 for a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. micros, respectively. absolute numbers of target bacteria were all higher in patients, but only the mean percentage of b. forsythus was significantly higher in patients in comparison to controls (p < 0.001). conclusions: a. actinomycetemcomitans, p.  gingivalis, p. intermedia, b. forsythus, f. nucleatum and p. micros are all significant markers for destructive periodontal disease in adult subjects. based  on calculated odds ratios, b. forsythus and p. gingivalis are the strongest bacterial markers for this disease and are infrequently cultured from subjects without periodontal bone loss.

AB  == experimental studies have shown that intraoral transmission of bacteria can occur. of course, the question arises as to how this transmission may happen. in  this study, the contamination of interdental brushes by periodontopathogens is examined and compared to the microbial load of the periodontal pockets. in ten untreated chronic periodontitis patients, four interdental sites were professionally brushed with one interdental brush per patient. subsequently, samples from the depths of the pockets (of the specific interdental sites) were obtained with paper-points. the interdental brush samples and the samples of the  subgingival plaque, obtained by the pooled paper-points, were processed for dark-field microscopy examination as well as anaerobic culturing. the results showed that, although significant differences could be found between the brushes  and paper-points with direct microscopy, the culturing did not uncover many differences. on the contrary, the detection frequencies of specific bacterial species were almost the same between the two. the total anaerobic colony-forming  units (cfu), p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and e. corrodens found on the brushes showed a significant correlation with the subgingival plaque samples (p<0.005). these results suggest that, in untreated situations, interdental brushes are contaminated relatively easily by putative periodontopathogens in numbers comparable to their presence in periodontal pockets. this contamination could be  a factor in the intraoral spread of bacteria.

TI  == 3-chloro-dl-alanine resistance by l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase activity.
AB  == the antibacterial agent 3-chloro-dl-alanine (3ca) is an inhibitor of peptidoglycan synthesis. fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis, the bacteria responsible for oral malodor, are shown to be resistant to 1 mm 3ca, whereas streptococcus mutans and escherichia coli are sensitive to this antibacterial agent at the same concentration. we isolated the 3ca resistance gene from f. nucleatum and showed that the gene encodes an l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase that catalyzes the alpha,gamma-elimination of l-methionine to produce methyl mercaptan. the enzyme also exhibits 3ca chloride-lyase (deaminating) activity. this antibacterial agent is expected to be useful for specific selection of malodorous oral bacteria producing high amounts of methyl mercaptan.

TI  == influence of secondary colonizers and human plasma on the adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis in vitro.
AB  == the influence of secondary colonizers (fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces naeslundii) and the effect of human plasma on the adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis were investigated. hydroxyapatite (hap) discs coated with streptococcus sanguis were immersed in a 3h-labeled bacterial cell suspension of  f. nucleatum or a. naeslundii and then in a 14c-labeled p. gingivalis cell suspension. bacterial cells on the discs were pyrolysed to quantify the radioisotopes released. the cell numbers of secondary colonizers on the discs increased with immersion time and this, in turn, resulted in significantly elevated adherence of p. gingivalis. these two secondary colonizers had very similar positive effects on the adherence of p. gingivalis. human plasma significantly inhibited the adherence of p. gingivalis and secondary colonizers to s. sanguis-coated hap discs. adherence of p. gingivalis and a. naeslundii was  strongly inhibited by plasma, while that of f. nucleatum was affected the least.  treatment with plasma, after immersion of streptococcal-coated discs in individual cell suspension of secondary colonizers, also reduced subsequent adherence of p. gingivalis. the rate of decrease was much smaller in f. nucleatum. these results indicate that both f. nucleatum and a. naeslundii enhance the adherence of p. gingivalis, and that the former may play a more important role in the establishment of p. gingivalis in dental plaque where plasma-derived components are present.

TI  == salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in sudanese adults.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult sudanese subjects. material and methods: the study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. the periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using whole genomic dna probes. results: a high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or =  105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. between 12% and 16%  of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, c. rectus and e. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, respectively. there were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. presence of > or = 105 l. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). there were significantly higher levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, c. rectus, p. micros, v. parvula, s. mutans, s. anginosus, a. israelii, c. sputigena, and c. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, e. corrodens, l. acidophilus, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. oralis, and s. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. conclusions: : the findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. this is the first report that the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.

TI  == effects of glucose and fluoride on competition and metabolism within in vitro dental bacterial communities and biofilms.
AB  == antimicrobial effects of fluoride in vivo remain contentious. previous studies suggested that 1 mm naf reduced acid production from glucose, and prevented the enrichment of bacteria associated with caries in a chemostat model. the present study examines the effects of a lower fluoride concentration (0.53 mm, 10 ppm naf) in both biofilm and planktonic microbial communities. nine oral species were grown at ph 7.0 and pulsed on 10 successive days with glucose; bacterial metabolism was allowed to reduce the ph for 6 h before being returned to neutrality, either in the presence or absence of naf. in addition, 10-day-old mixed culture biofilms were overlaid with glucose, with or without naf, and the ph change followed by microelectrode. after 10 days, chemostat ph dropped to ca.  ph 4.5 following glucose pulses, and the community was dominated by streptococcus mutans (rising from 4 to 23% of total cfu) and veillonella dispar (16 to 73%). in comparison, after 10 days pulsing with glucose + fluoride, the final ph was significantly higher (ca. ph 4.9) (paired t test, p < 0.0001). the culture was predominated by v. dispar (70%) and actinomyces naeslundii (13%), whereas s. mutans proportions were significantly lower (t test, p = 0.04), remaining <3% of  the total flora, compared to the culture without fluoride. biofilm ph fell to only ph 5.55 1 h after glucose/fluoride overlay, compared to 4.55 with glucose alone (paired t test, p < 0.000001). analysis of the data suggests that fluoride  exerts dual antimicrobial modes of action. fluoride prevents enrichment of s. mutans by inhibiting critical metabolic processes (direct effect) and, in an inter-related way, by reducing environmental acidification (indirect effect) in biofilms.

TI  == mice lacking monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 have enhanced susceptibility to an interstitial polymicrobial infection due to impaired monocyte recruitment.
AB  == monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (mcp-1) is an important chemokine that induces monocyte recruitment in a number of different pathologies, including infection. to investigate the role of mcp-1 in protecting a host from a chronic interstitial polymicrobial infection, dental pulps of mcp-1(-/-) mice and controls were inoculated with six different oral pathogens. in this model the recruitment of leukocytes and the impact of a genetic deletion on the susceptibility to infection can be accurately assessed by measuring the progression of soft tissue  necrosis and osteolytic lesion formation. the absence of mcp-1 significantly impaired the recruitment of monocytes, which at later time points was threefold higher in the wild-type mice than in mcp-1(-/-) mice (p < 0.05). the consequence  was significantly enhanced rates of soft tissue necrosis and bone resorption (p < 0.05). we also determined that the mcp-1(-/-) mice were able to recruit polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns) to a similar or greater extent as controls and to produce equivalent levels of porphyromonas gingivalis-specific total immunoglobulin g (igg) and igg1. these results point to the importance of mcp-1 expression and monocyte recruitment in antibacterial defense and demonstrate that antibacterial defense is not due to an indirect effect on pmn recruitment or modulation of the adaptive immune response.

TI  == parotid salivary s-iga antibodies during experimental gingivitis in smokers and non-smokers.
AB  == persons who smoke display a less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the  experimental gingivitis model as compared with non-smokers. the aim of the present study was to investigate whether this could partly be explained by differences in levels of parotid total secretory iga (s-iga) or parotid s-iga reactive with selected oral microorganisms. parotid saliva samples were obtained  from 11 smoking and 14 non-smoking volunteers, at baseline, after 5 and 14 days of full mouth experimental gingivitis. output levels of total s-iga and of specific s-iga reactive with cell extracts from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces naeslundii, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mutans were determined in the samples by means of elisa. smokers and non-smokers were found to have similar output levels (microg/min) of total s-iga, and the values did not significantly change during the experimental gingivitis trial. parotid salivary outputs (units/min) of the bacteria-specific s-iga at baseline and at days 5 and 14, were not different between smokers and non-smokers; no changes were observed during the experimental gingivitis trial. the present observations indicate that total s-iga and bacteria-specific s-iga in saliva are not main factors that can explain the less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the experimental gingivitis model in smokers as compared with non-smokers.

AB  == background: different periodontopathogenic microbiota have been associated with periodontal diseases in several populations. the present investigation determined the subgingival microbiota of untreated chronic periodontitis brazilians using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. methods: twenty-five periodontitis patients (mean age, 41 +/- 2; mean probing depth [pd], 3.3 +/- 0.2; mean attachment level [al], 3.6 +/- 0.2) with no history of previous periodontal  therapy and a control group of 14 healthy subjects (mean age, 34 +/- 0.6; mean pd, 1.8 +/- 0.2; mean al, 1.7 +/- 0.1) were selected. measurements of pd, al, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation, and suppuration were recorded at 6 sites/tooth. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 4 sites in each tooth/subject in both groups. the presence and levels of 41 subgingival species were determined in 4,032 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard method. results: periodontal pathogens, as well as some unusual species (e. faecalis, e. coli and bartonella sp.), were detected significantly more often and/or in higher levels in the periodontitis group (p < 0.05). most species were more frequently detected in interproximal sites. b. forsythus, p. gingivalis, e. nodatum, and f. nucleatum ss vincentii showed a significant positive correlation with mean pd and al (p < 0.05). conclusions: the subgingival microbiota of brazilians with untreated chronic periodontitis were complex, including high proportions of periodontopathogens commonly found in other populations, as well as some unusual species.

AB  == t cell cytokine profiles and specific serum antibody levels in five groups of balb/c mice immunized with saline alone, viable fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586, viable porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277, f. nucleatum followed by p. gingivalis and p. gingivalis followed by f. nucleatum were determined. splenic cd4 and cd8 cells were examined for intracytoplasmic interleukin (il)-4, interferon (ifn)-gamma and il-10 by dual colour flow cytometry and the levels of  serum anti-f. nucleatum and anti-p. gingivalis antibodies determined by an elisa. both th1 and th2 responses were demonstrated by all groups, and while there were  slightly lower percentages of cytokine positive t cells in mice injected with f.  nucleatum alone compared with the other groups immunized with bacteria, f. nucleatum had no effect on the t cell production of cytokines induced by p. gingivalis in the two groups immunized with both organisms. however, the percentages of cytokine positive cd8 cells were generally significantly higher than those of the cd4 cells. mice immunized with f. nucleatum alone had high levels of serum anti-f. nucleatum antibodies with very low levels of p. gingivalis antibodies, whereas mice injected with p. gingivalis alone produced anti-p. gingivalis antibodies predominantly. although the levels of anti-f. nucleatum antibodies in mice injected with f. nucleatum followed by p. gingivalis were the same as in mice immunized with f. nucleatum alone, antibody levels to p. gingivalis were very low. in contrast, mice injected with p. gingivalis followed  by f. nucleatum produced equal levels of both anti-p. gingivalis and anti-f. nucleatum antibodies, although at lower levels than the other three groups immunized with bacteria, respectively. anti-actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus and prevotella intermedia serum antibody levels were also determined and found to be negligible. in conclusion, f. nucleatum immunization does not affect the splenic t cell cytokine response to p. gingivalis. however, f. nucleatum immunization prior to that of p. gingivalis almost completely inhibited the production of anti-p. gingivalis antibodies while p. gingivalis injection before f. nucleatum demonstrated a partial inhibitory effect by p. gingivalis on antibody production to f. nucleatum. the significance of these results with respect to human periodontal disease is difficult to determine. however, they may explain in part differing responses to p. gingivalis in different individuals who may or may not have had prior exposure to f. nucleatum. finally, the results suggested that p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum do not induce  the production of cross-reactive antibodies to other oral microorganisms.

AB  == background, aims: conventional mechanical treatment of papillon-lefevre syndrome  periodontitis has a poor prognosis. this report describes an effective antimicrobial treatment of rapidly progressing periodontitis in an 11-year old girl having papillon-lefevre syndrome. method: clinical examination included conventional periodontal measurements and radiographic analysis. occurrence of major suspected periodontopathic bacteria was determined by selective and non-selective culture and by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) identification. presence of cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr type 1 virus was determined by a nested-pcr detection method. therapy included scaling and root planing, oral hygiene instruction, and systemic amoxicillin-metronidazole therapy (250 mg of each/3 times daily/10 days) which, based on follow-up microbiological testing, was repeated after 4 months. supportive periodontal therapy took place at 2 visits during a 16-month period. results: at baseline, 10 of 22 available teeth demonstrated severe periodontal breakdown. at 16 months, probing and radiographic measurements revealed no teeth with additional attachment loss, and several teeth exhibited significant reduction in gingivitis and pocket depth, increase in radiographic alveolar bone height and clinical attachment level, and radiographic evidence of crestal lamina dura. baseline subgingival microbiota included actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (3.4% of total isolates), prevotella nigrescens (16.4%), fusobacteriumnucleatum (14.3%) and peptostreptococcus micros  (10.6%), as well as cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr type 1 virus. at termination of the study, culture and pcr examinations showed absence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. micros and herpesviruses, and p. nigrescens and f.nucleatum each comprised less than 0.1 % of subgingival isolates. conclusion: this study suggests that controlling the periodontopathic microbiota by appropriate antibiotic and conventional periodontal therapy can arrest papillon-lefevre syndrome periodontitis.

TI  == maternal periodontitis and prematurity. part ii: maternal infection and fetal exposure.
AB  == clinical data from the first 812 deliveries from a cohort study of pregnant mothers entitled oral conditions and pregnancy (ocap) demonstrate that both antepartum maternal periodontal disease and incidence/progression of periodontal  disease are associated with preterm birth and growth restriction after adjusting  for traditional obstetric risk factors. in the current study we present measures  of maternal periodontal infection using whole chromosomal dna probes to identify  15 periodontal organisms within maternal periodontal plaque sampled at delivery.  in addition, maternal postpartum igg antibody and fetal exposure, as indexed by fetal cord blood igm level to these 15 maternal oral pathogens, was measured by whole bacterial immunoblots. the potential role of maternal infection with specific organisms within 2 bacterial complexes most often associated with periodontitis, conventionally termed "orange" (campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella nigrescens, and prevotella intermedia) and "red" (porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola) complexes, respectively, to prematurity was investigated by relating the presence of oral infection, maternal igg, and fetal  cord igm, comparing full-term to preterm (gestational age < 37 weeks). the prevalence of 8 periodontal pathogens was similar among term and preterm mothers  at postpartum. there was a 2.9-fold higher prevalence of igm seropositivity for one or more organisms of the orange or red complex among preterm babies, as compared to term babies (19.9% versus 6.9%, respectively, p = 0.0015, chi square). specifically, the prevalence of positive fetal igm to c. rectus was significantly higher for preterm as compared to full-term neonates (20.0% versus  6.3%, p = 0.0002, as well as p. intermedia (8.8% versus 1.1%, p = 0.0003). a lack of maternal igg antibody to organisms of the red complex was associated with an increased rate of prematurity with an odds ratio (or) = 2.2; confidence interval  (ci) 1.48 to 3.79), consistent with the concept that maternal antibody protects the fetus from exposure and resultant prematurity. the highest rate of prematurity (66.7%) was observed among those mothers without a protective red complex igg response coupled with a fetal igm response to orange complex microbes (combined or 10.3; p < 0.0001). these data support the concept that maternal periodontal infection in the absence of a protective maternal antibody response is associated with systemic dissemination of oral organisms that translocate to the fetus resulting in prematurity. the high prevalence of elevated fetal igm to  c. rectus among premature infants raises the possibility that this specific maternal oral pathogen may serve as a primary fetal infectious agent eliciting prematurity.

TI  == dipeptide utilization by the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum, which can frequently be isolated from periodontal pockets, preferentially utilize proteins and peptides as growth substrates. in this study, we determined the size of peptide that is preferentially utilized as  a source of energy and material for cell growth by p. gingivalis, p. intermedia,  p. nigrescens and f. nucleatum using various sizes of poly amino acids consisting of two to approximately 100 molecules of aspartate or glutamate. resting cells of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and p. nigrescens utilized aspartylaspartate, while  cells of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum utilized glutamylglutamate. the addition  of aspartylaspartate to the culture medium increased the growth of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and p. nigrescens, while the addition of glutamylglutamate promoted the growth of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum. these results clearly indicate that dipeptides such as aspartylaspartate and glutamylglutamate can be utilized as growth substrates for p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens and f. nucleatum.

AB  == the study on the sensitiveness of slow-growing anaerobes bacteria to antibiotics  is delicate when you consider the technical motives that make it difficult to transpose the standard methods frequently used in microbiological laboratories. the three main methods used to determine susceptibility to antibiotics are: disk-diffusion test, antibiotics containing microdilution plates and atb ana (biomerieux). the aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of each of these methods on severe anaerobes bacteria isolated in sub-gingival flora of patients suffering from developing periodontitis (rapidly progressive periodontitis, refractory periodontitis, active stage of adult chronic periodontitis). the observed bacteria are: porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, peptostreptococcus micros. antibiotics used are: ampicilline, amoxicilline, tetracycline, erythromycine, metronidazole. the comparison of the minimal inhibitory concentrations (m.i.c) of each of these methods has permitted to show a strict correlation in the results observed with these three methods, if only the growth  of the severe anaerobes bacteria on agar medium does not exceed 72 hours.

AB  == toll-like receptors (tlrs) 2 and 4 have recently been identified as possible signal transducers for various bacterial ligands. to investigate the roles of tlrs in the recognition of periodontopathic bacteria by the innate immune system, a chinese hamster ovary (cho) nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab)-dependent reporter cell line, 7.7, which is defective in both tlr2- and tlr4-dependent signaling pathways was transfected with human cd14 and tlrs. when the transfectants were exposed to freeze-dried periodontopathic bacteria, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, and fusobacterium nucleatum, and a non-oral bacterium, escherichia coli, all species of the bacteria induced nf-kappab-dependent cd25 expression in  7.7/hutlr2 cells. although freeze-dried a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, and e. coli also induced cd25 expression in 7.7/hutlr4 cells, freeze-dried p. gingivalis did not. similarly, lipopolysaccharides (lps) extracted from a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, and e. coli induced cd25 expression in 7.7/hutlr4 cells, but lps from p. gingivalis and c. ochracea did not. furthermore, lps from p. gingivalis and c. ochracea attenuated cd25 expression in 7.7/hutlr4 cells induced by repurified lps from e. coli. lps from p. gingivalis and c. ochracea also inhibited the secretion of interleukin-6 (il-6) from u373 cells, the secretion of il-1beta from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and icam-1 expression in human gingival fibroblasts induced by repurified lps from e. coli. these findings indicated that lps from p. gingivalis and c. ochracea worked as antagonists for human tlr4. the antagonistic activity of lps from these periodontopathic bacteria may be associated with the etiology of periodontal diseases.

TI  == supragingival and subgingival microbiota of adult patients with down's syndrome.  changes after periodontal treatment.
AB  == in this longitudinal study, five adult down's syndrome patients with periodontitis were placed on a frequent recall visit schedule (every 6 weeks) after treatment, in order to investigate: 1) the microbiological status, both supragingivally and subgingivally, and the changes that occurred after treatment  and 2) the effect of frequent professional supragingival plaque control on the subgingival microbiota and clinical variables in these patients. the clinical variables recorded were probing pocket depth, probing attachment level, bleeding  on probing and presence of plaque (full mouth, six surfaces per tooth). microbiological examination was performed separately for supragingival and subgingival samples from the same site for 14 species, using whole genomic dna probes and the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique. the findings indicate that, although a reduction of periodontal indices was noticed, plaque levels remained high (60%) even at the end of the experimental period. periodontal pathogens including porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were frequently detected both supragingivally and subgingivally (>30%). the presence of a species supragingivally and the presence at the same time points subgingivally were correlated. this finding suggested that supragingival plaque acts as a reservoir  for reinfection of treated sites. a reduction of the percentages of detection of  these species was noticed 1 month after an oral hygiene period as well as at 3 and 6 months after treatment. inadequate oral hygiene as performed by these patients probably affected supragingival, and consequently subgingival, plaque composition.

TI  == lactoferrin, amylase and mucin muc5b and their relation to the oral microflora in hyposalivation of different origins.
AB  == there are several reasons for hyposalivation, each affecting the salivary composition in different ways. the aim of this study was to analyze and compare lactoferrin, amylase and mucin muc5b in stimulated whole saliva collected from subjects with hyposalivation of different origins and to relate the results to the presence of some microbial species associated with oral disorders. albumin was determined as a marker of serum leakage. the characteristic feature for subjects with radiation-induced hyposalivation was a large increase in lactoferrin, probably due to leakage through inflamed mucosal tissues, while it was a high albumin content for the group with primary sjogren's syndrome, probably due to disruption of the fragile mucosa. the saliva composition in subjects with hyposalivation of unknown origin or due to medicines was close to that in the healthy controls. all three hyposalivation groups tended to display a decrease in the concentrations of muc5b and amylase. none of the microbial species analyzed (streptococci, mutans streptococci, lactobacillus spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus and enterics) correlated with concentration of muc5b in saliva. the rt group, having the highest concentration of lactoferrin, had the lowest median number of f. nucleatum and was the only group in which median number of p. intermedia/p. nigrescens was zero.

TI  == prior exposure of mice to fusobacterium nucleatum modulates host response to porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == multiple periodontal pathogens sequentially colonize the subgingival niche during the conversion from gingivitis to destructive periodontal disease. an animal model of sequential immunization with key periodontal pathogens has been developed to determine whether t- and b-lymphocyte effector functions are skewed  and fail to protect the host from pathogenic challenge. the present study was performed to evaluate the immunomodulatory effect of exposure to fusobacterium nucleatum prior to porphyromonas gingivalis. group 1 (control) mice were immunized with phosphate-buffered saline, group 2 were immunized with f. nucleatum prior to p. gingivalis and group 3 were immunized with p. gingivalis alone. all the t-cell clones derived from group 2 demonstrated type 2 helper t-cell clone (th2 subsets), whereas those from group 3 mice demonstrated th1 subsets. exposure of mice to f. nucleatum prior to p. gingivalis interfered with  the opsonophagocytosis function of sera against p. gingivalis. in adoptive t-cell transfer experiments, in vivo protective capacity of type 2 helper t-cell clones  (th2) from group 2 was significantly lower than type 1 helper t-cell clones (th1) from group 3 against the lethal dose infection of p. gingivalis. western blot analysis indicated a different pattern of recognition of p. gingivalis fimbrial proteins between sera from group 2 and group 3. in conclusion, these studies suggest that exposure of a host to f. nucleatum prior to the periodontal pathogen p. gingivalis modulates the host immune responses to p. gingivalis at the humoral, cellular and molecular levels.

TI  == intra- and interspecies regulation of gene expression by actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans luxs.
AB  == the cell density-dependent control of gene expression is employed by many bacteria for regulating a variety of physiological functions, including the generation of bioluminescence, sporulation, formation of biofilms, and the expression of virulence factors. although periodontal organisms do not appear to  secrete acyl-homoserine lactone signals, several species, e.g., porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum, have recently been shown to secrete a signal related to the autoinducer ii (ai-2) of the signal system 2 pathway in vibrio harveyi. here, we report that the periodontal pathogen actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans expresses a homolog of v. harveyi luxs and secretes an ai-2-like signal. cell-free conditioned medium from a. actinomycetemcomitans or from a recombinant escherichia coli strain (e. coli ais) expressing a. actinomycetemcomitans luxs induced luminescence in v. harveyi bb170 >200-fold over controls. ai-2 levels peaked in mid-exponential-phase cultures of  a. actinomycetemcomitans and were significantly reduced in late-log- and stationary-phase cultures. incubation of early-log-phase a. actinomycetemcomitans cells with conditioned medium from a. actinomycetemcomitans or from e. coli ais resulted in a threefold induction of leukotoxic activity and a concomitant increase in leukotoxin polypeptide. in contrast, no increase in leukotoxin expression occurred when cells were exposed to sterile medium or to conditioned broth from e. coli ais(-), a recombinant strain in which luxs was insertionally inactivated. a. actinomycetemcomitans ai-2 also induced expression of afua, encoding a periplasmic iron transport protein, approximately eightfold, suggesting that luxs-dependent signaling may play a role in the regulation of iron acquisition by a. actinomycetemcomitans. finally, a. actinomycetemcomitans ai-2 added in trans complemented a luxs knockout mutation in p. gingivalis by modulating the expression of the luxs-regulated genes uvrb and hasf in this organism. together, these results suggest that luxs-dependent signaling may modulate aspects of virulence and the uptake of iron by a. actinomycetemcomitans  and induce responses in other periodontal organisms in mixed-species oral biofilm.

TI  == absence of a specific subgingival microflora in adults with down's syndrome.
AB  == background: periodontal disease in down's syndrome (ds) is generally characterized by a high degree of bone loss. bone loss of 5 mm or more is observed in 70% of these subjects. among ds subjects, considerable differences in disease progression occur. so far, no studies have been conducted in which specific properties of the subgingival microflora have been related to the condition observed. aims: to investigate (1) the subgingival microflora in ds subjects and other mentally retarded (control) individuals which were matched to  the utmost and (2) to investigate the subgingival microflora of a "low-risk" and  a " high-risk" group formed in ds subjects. material and methods: 17 ds subjects  and 17 control subjects were matched with respect to age, plaque level and bleeding on probing. in addition, the ds group was divided in a "low-risk" group  (0-2 teeth lost due to periodontal disease n=6) and a "high-risk"group (6-13 teeth lost due to periodontal disease n=11). prevalence and proportions of the putative periodontal pathogens actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus, peptostreptococcus micros, fusobacterium nucleatum and campylobacter rectus in the subgingival plaque were determined using anaerobic culture techniques. no differences in the prevalence of distinct suspected periodontopathic bacteria and bacterial subgingival composition between the ds group and the control group could be established. also no differences in the prevalence of the seven investigated microbial species between the "low-risk" and the "high-risk" group were observed. conclusions: because of the lack of differences in microflora between the ds group and the control group, a specific effect of the microbiological composition in the periodontal status of subjects with ds can be  excluded in this population. host factors constitute the more likely explanation  of the differences observed in ds.

TI  == efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (ii). effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

AB  == the purpose of the study was to determine the effect of electron beam sterilization on gutta-percha cones (gpcs) at different times after sterilization. an agar diffusion test was used with -one aerobic bacterium (bacillus subtilis) and five oral anaerobic bacteria (fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, propionibacterium acnes, and veillonella parvula). with each microorganism 30 agar plates were prepared, evenly distributed among three groups (group 1: unsterilized gpcs; groups 2 and 3: gpcs sterilized by electron beam irradiation 5 months and 5 yr before, respectively). one gpc of the selected group was placed in each plate. after incubation the area of inhibition was read on the agar plates. inhibition of growth was significantly different for the tested microorganisms. however no significant difference was observed between the sterilized and unsterilized gpcs. both the tested sterilized and unsterilized gpcs impair the growth of endodontic  pathogens, with no influence of the time elapsed since sterilization.

TI  == an in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial efficacy of irrigants on biofilms of  root canal isolates.
AB  == aim: the bactericidal effect of four antimicrobial agents was investigated against single-species biofilms derived from a range of root canal isolates. methodology: single-species biofilms of prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum and enterococcus faecalis were generated on membrane filter discs and subjected to 15 min or 1 h incubation with 5 p.p.m. colloidal silver, 2.25% sodium hypochlorite (naocl), 0.2% chlorhexidine, 10% iodine or phosphate buffered saline (pbs) as a control. the antimicrobial activity of the agents was neutralized and the bacterial cells  were harvested from the discs by vortexing, serially diluted in reduced transport fluid, plated on fastidious anaerobe agar containing 5% horse blood, incubated anaerobically and colony-forming units calculated. results: iodine and naocl were more effective than chlorhexidine except against p. micros and p. intermedia where they were all 100% effective. iodine and naocl elicited a 100% kill after 1 h incubation for all strains used. however, after 15 min, they showed differing bactericidal effects depending on the strain. none of the agents were effective against f. nucleatum after 15 min but naocl, iodine and chlorhexidine were all effective after 1 h. colloidal silver was generally ineffective. conclusions: the effectiveness of a particular agent was dependent on the nature of the organism in the biofilm and on the contact time. naocl was generally the most effective agent tested, followed by iodine. however the clinical efficacy of these agents must be considered in light of the complex root canal anatomy and polymicrobial nature of root canal infections.

TI  == evaluation of co-aggregation among streptococcus mitis, fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == aims: to develop a semi-quantitative method for evaluating co-aggregation reactions among three bacterial species, and to examine the influence of fusobacterium nucleatum on the adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis. methods and results: the method involves coating hydroxyapatite (hap) discs with streptococcal cells and treatment with radio-labelled bacterial cell suspensions. the sensitivity of the method was estimated by comparison with a turbidometric co-aggregation assay. results from the two methods were in close agreement. streptococcus mitis-coated hap discs were immersed in a 3h-labelled fus. nucleatum cell suspension and then a 14c-labelled p. gingivalis cell suspension.  the discs were then pyrolysed to recover and quantify the released 3h and 14c radioactivity. the number of fus. nucleatum cells on the discs increased with immersion time and this, in turn, resulted in elevated adherence of p. gingivalis. conclusion: the data indicate that the method closely reflects co-aggregation characters, and that fus. nucleatum has a positive effect on the adherence of p. gingivalis. significance and impact of the study: the present method, which is designed to mimic the oral environment, should prove useful in the semi-quantitative evaluation of co-aggregation reactions.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of acidified nitrite on periodontal bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial agent nitric oxide (no) is formed in the mouth and its concentration is directly related to salivary nitrite, which in turn is related to dietary nitrate intake. the aim of this study was to determine whether nitrite under acidic conditions will have an inhibitory effect, possibly occurring through no production, on the periodontal disease pathogens fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens and porphyromonas gingivalis. whereas the growth of these organisms was inhibited by a more acid ph, the addition of nitrite caused a marked, further dose-dependent reduction in bacterial numbers after exposure. the ability of these bacteria to recover from nitrite exposure was also affected by ph and nitrite concentration. at acidity levels below ph 5.0, low concentrations of nitrite (0.2 mm) caused effective complete killing of the periodontal bacteria. addition of sodium thiocyanate did not increase the bacteriostatic or bacteriocidal activity of acidified nitrite against any of the  3 bacteria. these results demonstrate the possibility that nitrite in saliva, under appropriate conditions, may have an effect on the growth and survival of the bacteria implicated in periodontal disease.

TI  == c-telopeptide pyridinoline cross-links (ictp) and periodontal pathogens associated with endosseous oral implants.
AB  == detection of periodontal or peri-implant sites exhibiting progressing disease or  those at risk of deterioration has proven difficult. pyridinoline cross-linked carboxyterminal telopeptide of type i collagen (ictp), a marker specific for bone degradation found in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf), has been associated with both bone and attachment loss in periodontitis and may be useful for predicting disease activity. the aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine the relationship between ictp levels and subgingival species around implants and teeth from 20 partially and 2 fully edentulous patients. gcf and plaque samples were collected from the mesiobuccal site of each implant and tooth. radioimmunoassay techniques were utilized to determine gcf ictp levels. plaque samples were analyzed utilizing checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. traditional clinical parameters were assessed. seventy-one implants and 370 teeth from 22 subjects were examined. ictp levels and subgingival plaque composition were not significantly different between implants and teeth. implant sites colonized by prevotella intermedia, capnocytophaga gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii, and streptococcus gordonii exhibited odds ratios of 12.4, 9.3, 8.1, and 6.7, respectively of detecting ictp. these results suggest a relationship between elevated ictp levels at implant sites and some species associated with disease progression. longitudinal studies are necessary to determine whether elevated ictp levels may predict the development of peri-implant bone loss.

TI  == mutans streptococci in subgingival plaque of treated and untreated patients with  periodontitis.
AB  == background: the etiology of root caries is thought to be identical to coronal caries, though root caries seem to be more complicated because of the higher susceptibility of exposed roots (dentin) by periodontal therapy to demineralization than intact enamel. this implies that mutans streptococci are the most likely pathogens in the development of root caries. although it is known that both the numbers of mutans streptococci and the frequency of isolation in root caries lesions are negatively correlated with the distance from the gingival margin, the subgingival sulcus has not been considered a possible habitat for mutans streptococci. however, subgingival occurrence of mutans streptococci in both untreated and treated periodontal patients has not been documented well in the literature. objective: to investigate the presence and levels of mutans streptococci in the subgingival plaque of patients (n=154) in different stages of periodontal therapy. the subgingival sulcus may be a possible habitat for mutans  streptococci. this localisation of mutans streptococci may be of importance in the development of root caries after periodontal surgery. materials and methods:  in this cross-sectional study, subgingival plaque samples from 154 consecutive adult periodontitis patients were tested for presence and levels of mutans streptococci and putative periodontal pathogens by anaerobic cultures. these patients were divided into 4 groups based on their stage of periodontal treatment: (1) untreated patients; (2) patients after initial periodontal therapy only; (3) patients in the maintenance phase who not underwent periodontal surgery; (4) patients after periodontal surgery. results: the prevalence of mutans streptococci in the 4 study groups varied from 82% in untreated patients to 94% in maintenance patients. the mean proportion of mutans streptococci was 6.65% in maintenance patients versus 1.86% in untreated patients (p=0.005) and 2.51% in patients after scaling and root planing (p=0.041). conclusions: the subgingival area is a microbial habitat for mutans streptococci that may be of importance in the development of root caries in periodontitis patients.

AB  == background/aims: in an indonesian population deprived of regular dental care, the experienced progression of disease between baseline (1987) and follow-up (1994) was investigated in relation to the composition of the subgingival microbiota at  follow-up. at baseline the age ranged from 15 to 25 years. clinical and microbiological evaluation was completed in 158 of the 167 subjects available at  follow-up. methods: plaque index (pi), pocket depth (pd), bleeding on probing (bop), and attachment loss (al) were scored at the approximal surfaces of all teeth and subgingival calculus on the approximal surfaces of the ramfjord teeth only (number of sites with subgingival calculus: nsc). a pooled sample of the deepest pocket in each quadrant was evaluated using microbiological culture techniques. results: at baseline the mean values of the clinical parameters were  al=0.35 mm, pi=1.01, bop=0.80 pd=3.25 mm and nsc=6.04 and at follow-up al=0.75 mm, pi=1.16, bop=1.19, pd=3.34 mm and nsc=5.85. all parameters except pd and nsc  showed a statistically significant increase. at follow-up the prevalence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was 40%, of porphyromonas gingivalis 67%, of prevotella intermedia 66%, of fusobacterium nucleatum 79%, of bacteroides forsythus 16%, of campylobacter rectus 4%, and of p. micros 6%. no differences in clinical parameters were found between groups with or without these micro-organisms. in 129 subjects al of > or =2 mm at > or =1 site was found. logistic regression showed three significant odds-ratio's for experienced progressive periodontitis: plaque index (12.2), gender (3.4) and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (2.9). conclusions: the results of this retrospective study suggest that plaque is the most important parameter related to experienced disease progression, and that the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans may be associated with increased chance of disease progression.

AB  == aim: the current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions of 40  bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples during, immediately after and up  to 1 year after metronidazole or amoxicillin therapy combined with srp. method: after baseline clinical and microbiological monitoring, 17 adult periodontitis subjects received full mouth srp and 14 days systemic administration of either metronidazole (250 mg, tid, n=8) or amoxicillin (500 mg, tid, n=9). clinical measurements including % of sites with plaque, gingival redness, bleeding on probing and suppuration, pocket depth (pd) and attachment level (al) were made at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth in each subject at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days and from 2 randomly selected posterior teeth at 3, 7, and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. counts of 40 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significance of differences over time was determined using the quade test and between groups using ancova. results: mean pd was reduced from 3.22+/-0.12 at baseline to 2.81+/-0.16 (p<0.01) at 360 days and  from 3.38+/-0.23 mm to 2.80+/-0.14 mm (p<0.01) in the amoxicillin and metronidazole treated subjects respectively. corresponding values for mean al were 3.21+/-0.30 to 2.76+/-0.32 (p<0.05) and 3.23+/-0.28 mm to 2.94+/-0.23 mm (p<0.01). levels and proportions of bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola were markedly reduced during antibiotic administration and were lower than baseline levels at 360 days. counts (x10(5), +/-sem) of b. forsythus fell from baseline levels of 0.66+/-0.16 to 0.04+/-0.02,  0.13+/-0.04, 0.10+/-0.03 and 0.42+/-0.19 in the amoxicillin group at 14, 90, 180  and 360 days respectively (p<0.001). corresponding values for metronidazole treated subjects were: 1.69+/-0.28 to 0.02+/-0.01, 0.20+/-0.08, 0.22+/-0.06 and 0.22+/-0.08 (p<0.001). counts of campylobacter species, eubacterium nodatum, fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, f. periodonticum and prevotella nigrescens were also detected at lower mean levels during and immediately after therapy, but gradually increased after withdrawal of the antibiotics. members of the genera actinomyces, streptococcus and capnocytophaga were minimally affected by metronidazole. however, amoxicillin decreased the counts and proportions of actinomyces species during and after therapy. conclusions: the data suggest that  metronidazole and amoxicillin are useful in rapidly lowering counts of putative periodontal pathogens, but must be accompanied by other procedures to bring about periodontal stability.

TI  == smoking affects the subgingival microflora in periodontitis.
AB  == background: tobacco smoking has been identified as one major risk factor for destructive periodontal disease. scaling and root planing have been shown to be less effective in smokers with periodontitis. the aim of the present study was to compare the subgingival microbial flora of treated and untreated smokers and non-smokers. methods: four independent adult patient groups with periodontitis were included in this investigation: 88 untreated smokers (u-s); 90 untreated non-smokers (u-ns); 119 treated non-smokers (t-ns); and 171 treated smokers (t-s). clinical variables included cumulative plaque index (cpi), probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), cumulative bleeding index (cbi), and cumulative suppuration index (csi). paper point samples from the deepest bleeding pocket in each quadrant of the dentition were analyzed for the presence and levels of 6 periodontal bacterial pathogens using anaerobic culture techniques. results: u-s showed a higher mean cumulative plaque index than u-ns (3.5 versus 2.7). mean pd and mean cal were higher in the t-s in comparison to the t-ns group (7.0 versus 6.6 mm and 5.6 versus 4.7 mm, respectively). microbiological characteristics of u-s were a higher prevalence of prevotella intermedia/nigrescens and higher mean levels of peptostreptococcus micros (pm) and fusobacterium nucleatum (fn). t-s patients were characterized by higher prevalence of bacteroides forsythus (bf), pm, and campylobacter rectus (cr) and higher mean levels of pm and fn. the mean percentage of b. forsythus tended to be higher in the t-s group than in the t-ns group (6.9% versus 5.6%). the relative risk to be infected with bf, pm, and cr was statistically higher in smokers (odds ratios: 1.9, 1.9, and 1.6, respectively). the chance to find > or =10% of bf, pm, and/or fn was 3.3 higher in smokers when a. actinomycetemcomitans and p gingivalis were absent. detection of > or =20% pm/fn in treated patients was strongly associated with smoking (odds ratio 13.8, p= 0.002). conclusions: smoking is a determining factor for the composition of the subgingival microflora in adult patients with periodontitis and may select for a specific cluster of periodontal pathogens, notably bf, pm, fn, and cr. on the basis of these observations, smoking, among other criteria, may be one parameter to use in deciding to treat refractory periodontitis in smokers with a systemic antibiotic  therapy directed against smoking-associated periodontal bacteria.

TI  == microflora in oral ecosystems in primary sjogren's syndrome.
AB  == objective: knowledge of the effect of primary sjogren's syndrome (pss) on the microbial flora in the different predilection sites for oral disorders is needed  for planning preventive treatment. we carried out microbial analysis of samples from the dorsum of the tongue, smooth mucosa, supragingival tooth surfaces, and the gingival crevice region of 20 patients with pss. methods: a clinical oral examination was performed and whole unstimulated and stimulated secretion rates were measured. results: compared with healthy controls, subjects with pss harbored higher numbers and frequencies of streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp., and candida albicans in the supragingival plaque. on the smooth mucosa and  tongue, the pss subjects displayed an increased frequency of c. albicans, staphylococcus aureus, enterics, and enterococci. c. albicans was detected about  twice as frequently in the supragingival plaque as it was on the tongue. in the gingival crevice region, the pss group harbored slightly lower proportions of fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens than controls. the clinical and microbial differences were mainly due to the pss subjects with a stimulated secretion rate of < 0.5 ml/min. porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were not detected in any subject with pss. conclusion: the microbial flora in the different ecosystems reflected the status of oral disorders in the subjects with pss. specific site sampling and analysis in subjects with pss revealed further differences compared  with controls, and is therefore preferable to saliva sampling for oral treatment  planning and for the evaluation of the effect of oral treatment and of preventive measures implemented in individuals with pss.

AB  == coaggregation between porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum strains was previously studied using either a semi-quantitative macroscopic assay or radioactive tracer assays. a new automated microtiter plate assay is introduced, in which the plate reader (vmax) was adapted to allow quantitative evaluation of the kinetics of coaggregation. f nucleatum pk 1594 coaggregated with p. gingivalis hg 405 with a maximal coaggregation rate of 1.05 mod/min, which occurred at a p. gingivalis to f. nucleatum cell ratio of 1 to 2. f. nucleatum pk 1594 failed to do so with p. gingivalis strains a 7436 or atcc 33277. galactose inhibition of this coaggregation could be quantitatively measured over a wide range of concentrations to demonstrate its dose-dependent manner. p. gingivalis hg 405 failed to coaggregate with f. nucleatum strains atcc 25586 and atcc 49256. the assay used in the present study is a sensitive and efficient quantitative automated tool to study coaggregation and may replace tedious radioactive tracer assays.

TI  == relationship of cigarette smoking to the subgingival microbiota.
AB  == background: the relationship of cigarette smoking to the composition of the subgingival microbiota is not clear. some studies indicated higher levels of certain species in smokers, while other studies failed to detect differences in the microbiota between subjects with different smoking histories. thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to examine the prevalence, proportions and levels of the subgingival species in adult subjects who were current, past or never smokers. method: 272 adult subjects ranging in age from 20-86 years with at least 20 teeth were recruited for study. smoking history was obtained using a questionnaire. clinical measures were taken at 6 sites per tooth at all teeth excluding third molars at a baseline visit. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth excluding third molars in each subject at baseline and assayed individually for counts of 29 subgingival species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. subjects were subset according to smoking history into never (n=124), past (n=98) and current smokers (n=50). uni-variate and multi-variate analyses were used to seek associations between smoking category and the counts, proportions and prevalence of subgingival species. results: greater differences were observed for the prevalence (% of sites colonized) of the test species in the 3 smoking groups than were observed for counts or proportions of total counts. members of the orange and red complexes including e. nodatum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, p. intermedia, p. micros, p. nigrescens, b. forsythus, p. gingivalis and t. denticola were significantly more  prevalent in current smokers than in the other 2 groups. the difference in prevalence between smokers and non-smokers was due to greater colonization at sites with pocket depth <4 mm. stepwise multiple linear regression analysis indicated that combinations of the prevalence of 5 microbial species and pack years accounted for 44% of the variance for mean pocket depth (p<0.000001), while the prevalence of 3 microbial taxa along with age, pack years, current smoking and gender accounted for 31% of the variance in mean attachment level (p<0.000001). the difference in prevalence between current and never smokers of all members of the red complex and 8 of 12 members of the orange complex was significantly greater in the maxilla than in the mandible. conclusions: the major difference between the subgingival microbiota in subjects with different smoking  history was in the prevalence of species rather than counts or proportions. the greater extent of colonization in smokers appeared to be due to greater colonization at pocket depths <4 mm. differences in colonization patterns between current and never smokers were greater in the maxilla than in the mandible.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of silver nitrate against periodontal pathogens.
AB  == metal ions were evaluated as potential antimicrobial agents suitable for local delivery in the oral cavity for the treatment of periodontitis. silver nitrate, copper chloride, and zinc chloride were tested for antimicrobial activity in in vitro killing assays conducted in phosphate buffered saline with a series of oral bacteria including gram-negative periodontal pathogens and gram-positive streptococci. copper and zinc salts failed to exhibit strong and consistent activity against periodontal pathogens. in contrast, silver at a concentration of 0.5 microg/ml produced a 3 log10 reduction in colony forming units (cfu)/ml or greater against all periodontal pathogens tested including porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum vincentii, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus,  eikenella corrodens, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. in comparison, substantially higher concentrations of silver nitrate failed to kill oral streptococci. a silver nitrate concentration of 25 microg/ml produced log10 reductions in cfu/ml of 3.5-5 in killing assays performed in human serum against  p. gingivalis, demonstrating the ability of silver to retain activity in a biological medium similar to that encountered in vivo in the periodontal pocket.  these results identify silver nitrate, an antimicrobial that may possess advantages over traditional antibiotics, as a potential agent for controlled release local delivery in the oral cavity for the treatment of periodontitis.

TI  == smoking and subgingival microflora in periodontal disease.
AB  == aim: the present investigation was undertaken to analyze the influence of smoking on the periodontal disease associated subgingival microflora. the population included 33 smokers and 31 non-smokers in the age range 36-86 years. methods: microbial samples were obtained from 4 sites per patient. the checker-board dna-dna hybridization technology was used for detection of the bacterial species  p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, b. forsythus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, t. denticola, p. micros, c. rectus, e. corrodens, s. noxia and s. intermedius. results: using score 1 as cutoff, contrasting colonized versus non-colonized patients, 8 out of 12 species were detected in > or = 90% of both smokers and non-smokers. using score 4 as cutoff,  contrasting heavily colonized patients versus non-colonized and less heavily colonized patients, the detection rates decreased in both smokers and non-smokers. no significant differences in detection rates were observed between  smokers and non-smokers. logistic regression analysis indicated that neither smoking, probing depth nor gingival bleeding influenced the occurrence of the species analyzed. the lack of a smoking exposure dose-response further supported  the indication of a limited influence of smoking. conclusion: smoking exerts little, if any, influence on the subgingival occurrence of several of the bacteria most commonly associated with periodontal disease.

TI  == effect of lipopolysaccharide from periodontal pathogens on the production of tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 by human gingival fibroblasts.
AB  == both tissue plasminogen activator (t-pa) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (pai-2) are important proteolysis factors present in inflamed human periodontal tissues. the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of lipopolysaccharide (lps) on the synthesis of t-pa and pai-2 by human gingival fibroblasts (hgf). lps from different periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium  nucleatum were extracted by the hot phenol water method. the levels of t-pa and pai-2 secreted into the cell culture media were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisa). the mrna for t-pa and pai-2 were measured by rt-pcr. the results showed t-pa synthesis was increased in response to all types  of lps studied and pai-2 level was increased by lps from a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum, but not p. gingivalis. when comparing the effects of lps from non-periodontal bacteria (escherichia coli and salmonella enteritidis) with the lps from periodontal pathogens, we found that the ratio of t-pa to pai-2 was greater following exposure of the cells to lps from periodontal pathogens. the highest ratio of t-pa to pai-2 was found in those cells exposed to lps from p. gingivalis. these results indicate that lps derived from periodontal pathogens may cause unbalanced regulation of plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor by hgf and such an effect may, in part, contribute to the destruction of periodontal connective tissue through dysregulated pericellular proteolysis.

TI  == comparison of profiles of key periodontal pathogens in periodontium and endodontium.
AB  == despite the established anatomical relationship between the periodontal and pulpal tissues, bacterial migration between endodontium and periodontium is still under discussion. the objective of this study was an investigation of profiles of periodontal pathogens in pulpal and periodontal diseases affecting the same tooth by means of 16s rrna gene directed polymerase chain reaction (pcr). 31 intact teeth with both pulp and marginal infections were investigated. the diagnosis was based on clinical and radiological examination. samples were taken from the gingival sulcus or periodontal pocket, respectively, with sterile paper points before trepanation of the teeth. after trepanation sterile paper points and hedstroem files were used for taking samples from the root canal. specific pcr methods were used to detect the presence of the following pathogens: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola. in addition, quantitative competitive pcr was used to determine the total bacterial count of the samples. the investigated pathogens were proven to be present in the endondontium in all disease categories. particularly in endodontic samples of "chronic apical periodontitis" and "chronic adult periodontitis" profiles of the periodontal pathogens were found. the results confirmed that periodontal pathogens often accompany endodontic infections and supported the idea that the periodontic-endodontic interrelationships should be considered as critical pathways which might contribute to refractory courses of endodontic or periodontal diseases.

TI  == assessment of periradicular microbiota by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == in the present study the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. in group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. the gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. bacterial dna was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. the mean number (+/- sd) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in group 2 (p < 0.001). the majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from group 1 than from group 2. the differences were most notable for campylobacter gracilis, porphyromonas endodontalis, propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, streptococcus constellatus and actinomyces naeslundii i. bacterial species such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. also, p. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. the data supported the idea that  following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. the study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. the detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.

TI  == anaerobic bacterial extracts influence production of matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors by human dental pulp cells.
AB  == the role of human dental pulp (hdp) cells in extracellular matrix degradation in  pulpitis is still unclear. in this study, the effects of sonicated bacterial extracts (sbes) from prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas endodontalis, and porphyromonas gingivalis on the balance between the production of matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) and that of their inhibitors [tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (timps)] by hdp cells were examined. hdp cells were treated with sbes, and their culture media were later harvested. mmp activities and timp concentrations were determined by use of independent measurement strategies and sensitive elisas. the production of mmp-1 and mmp-2 was accelerated by all sbe. on the other hand, timp-1 production was slightly elevated; and timp-2 production was markedly inhibited by all of the extracts. sbes derived from these anaerobic bacteria seemed to affect the acceleration of extracellular matrix degradation activity by hdp cells. these findings suggest that hdp cells stimulated by bacterial byproducts may be involved in the pathogenesis of pulpitis.

TI  == the sensitivity of porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum to different (pseudo)halide-peroxidase combinations compared with mutans streptococci.
AB  == previous studies have shown that the peroxidase system with iodide is particularly effective against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. in the present study, the effects of iodide, chloride and thiocyanate in combinations with lactoperoxidase (lp) and myeloperoxidase (mp) on the viability of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mutans and s. rattus were analysed. bacteria were incubated in buffer solution containing peroxidase, substrate(s) and h2o2 (all in oral physiological concentrations), and plated after 0, 0.5 and 1 h. the oxidation product of iodide was the most bactericidal against all the bacteria tested. the effect was significantly weaker on mutans streptococci. physiological concentrations of thiocyanate abolished the effects of lp-h2o2-iodide and mp-h2o2-iodide/chloride combinations. thiocyanate-peroxidase systems have already been used in oral hygiene products. the incorporation of iodide into these products could make them much more potent  against periodontal pathogens, and also help to prevent transmission of these pathogens from person to person via saliva.

TI  == interleukin-8 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 regulation in oral epithelial cells by selected periodontal bacteria: multiple effects of porphyromonas gingivalis via antagonistic mechanisms.
AB  == interaction of bacteria with mucosal surfaces can modulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules produced by epithelial cells. previously, we showed that expression of interleukin-8 (il-8) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (icam-1) by gingival epithelial cells increases following interaction with several putative periodontal pathogens. in contrast, expression  of il-8 and icam-1 is reduced after porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 challenge. in the present study, we investigated the mechanisms that govern the regulation of these two molecules in bacterially infected gingival epithelial cells. experimental approaches included bacterial stimulation of gingival epithelial cells by either a brief challenge (1.5 to 2 h) or a continuous coculture throughout the incubation period. the kinetics of il-8 and icam-1 expression following brief challenge were such that (i) secretion of il-8 by gingival epithelial cells reached its peak 2 h following fusobacterium nucleatum  infection whereas it rapidly decreased within 2 h after p. gingivalis infection and remained decreased up to 30 h and (ii) il-8 and icam-1 mrna levels were up-regulated rapidly 2 to 4 h postinfection and then decreased to basal levels 8  to 20 h after infection with either actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, or p. gingivalis. attenuation of il-8 secretion was facilitated by adherent p. gingivalis strains. the il-8 secreted from epithelial cells after f.  nucleatum stimulation could be down-regulated by subsequent infection with p. gingivalis or its culture supernatant. although these results suggested that il-8 attenuation at the protein level might be associated with p. gingivalis proteases, the arg- and lys-gingipain proteases did not appear to be solely responsible for il-8 attenuation. in addition, while p. gingivalis up-regulated il-8 mrna expression, this effect was overridden when the bacteria were continuously cocultured with the epithelial cells. the il-8 mrna levels in epithelial cells following sequential challenge with p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum and vice versa were approximately identical and were lower than those following f. nucleatum challenge alone and higher than control levels or those following p. gingivalis challenge alone. thus, together with the protease effect, p. gingivalis possesses a powerful strategy to ensure the down-regulation of il-8 and icam-1.

TI  == early colonization of dental implants by putative periodontal pathogens in partially edentulous patients.
AB  == there is limited scientific information available on the early colonization of the peri-implant pockets in partially edentulous individuals. knowledge about this process is one step in better understanding the etiology and pathogenesis of peri-implantitis. in this study, the early colonization of the peri-implant pockets by putative periodontal pathogens was studied in 20 partially edentulous  individuals using anaerobic culture techniques. at baseline, the presence and levels of putative periodontal pathogens in the microflora of periodontal pockets and saliva were established. immediately after loading of the titanium implants and after 6 and 12 months the presence and levels of selected putative periodontal pathogens were determined in periodontal and peri-implant pockets. a  second aim was to detect bacterial contamination of the implant site and the inside of the implant. at baseline, the most frequently isolated species from the periodontal pockets were fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and peptostreptococcus micros. bacteroides forsythus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were isolated from 9, 2 and 3  patients respectively. six months after placing of the bridges, the majority of the implant sites had detectable levels of most periodontal bacterial species with the exception of a. actinomycetemcomitans which could not be isolated from any of the peri-implant samples during the experimental period, although 2 patients had this organism at baseline. in 2 patients with detectable subgingival p. gingivalis at baseline this species was found after 12 months in the peri-implant sites. one of these patients lost 2 implants which was associated with a high proportion of p. gingivalis in the peri-implant pockets. a second patient developed 2 fistulas around 2 implants at 8 months and this event was also associated with the presence of p. gingivalis. it is concluded that proper periodontal infection control before installment of dental implants in partially  edentulous patients may prevent early bacterial complications.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  == a diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. the samples were cultured  for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), streptococcus mitis (66-65%), prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), eikenella corrodens (51-52%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella loescheii, campylobacter gracilis, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter concisus, peptostreptococcus micros and selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. the bacterial species streptococcus constellatus, peptostreptococcus micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, e. corrodens and fusobacterium nucleatum  were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas streptococcus intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were associated with bleeding.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis platelet aggregation activity: outer membrane vesicles are potent activators of murine platelets.
AB  == recent evidence has established an association between chronic periodontitis and  cardiovascular disease. periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by a small group of gram-negative bacteria, of which porphyromonas gingivalis is considered an important causative agent. it has been proposed that dental plaque  bacteria and their products can disseminate into the bloodstream from the site of infection and promote thromboembolic events associated with atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. in this regard, streptococcus sanguis and p. gingivalis have been shown to induce platelet aggregation in vitro. here we report that p. gingivalis was able to induce platelet aggregation, and that oral strains of actinobaillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and trepenoma denticola failed to  aggregate platelets when tested for platelet aggregation activity under similar conditions. additionally, we show that vesicles (outer membrane evaginations that are shed into the environment by the bacteria) of p. gingivalis are potent inducers of mouse platelet aggregation in vitro. in summary, our data show that i) initial adherence of the bacterium to platelet may be facilitated by p. gingivalis fimbriae and ii) p. gingivalis vesicles possess platelet aggregation-inducing activity.

AB  == antigen-specific t-cell clones were obtained from mice immunized with fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953 and/or porphyromonas gingivalis 381. 10 balb/c mice per group were immunized with f. nucleatum followed by p. gingivalis, or with p. gingivalis alone by intraperitoneal injection of viable microorganisms. spleen t cells were isolated and stimulated in vitro with viable p. gingivalis cells to establish p. gingivalis-specific t-cell clones. t-cell phenotypes and cytokine profiles were determined along with t-cell responsiveness to f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis. serum immunoglobulin g antibody titers to f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis were also determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. all the t-cell clones derived from mice immunized with f. nucleatum followed by p. gingivalis demonstrated th2 subsets, while those from mice immunized with p. gingivalis alone demonstrated th1 subsets based on the flow cytometric analysis and cytokine profiles. all t-cell clones from both groups were cross-reactive to both p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum antigens. phenotypes of t-cell clones were all positive for cd4. mean post-immune serum igg antibody levels to f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis were significantly higher than the pre-immune levels (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, respectively). there were no significant differences in the antibody titers between the two groups. it was concluded that  p. gingivalis-specific t cells initially primed by cross-reactive f. nucleatum antigens were polarized to th2 subset, while t cells stimulated with p. gingivalis alone maintained the profile of th1 subset.

TI  == photoactive porphyrin derivative with broad-spectrum activity against oral pathogens in vitro.
AB  == photodynamic therapy (pdt) has historically been used as a means to treat cancerous tumors but has recently been used to kill bacterial cells through the use of targeted photosensitizers. pdt is a potential adjunct to scaling and root  planing in the treatment of periodontal disease. however, the effectiveness of porphyrin derivatives against microorganisms has been limited because some gram-negative bacteria are refractory to photodynamic treatment with these agents. we have designed a porphyrin derivative conjugated to a pentalysine moeity that endows the molecule with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. whereas the porphyrin, chlorin e6, showed in vitro activity against a limited spectrum of bacteria, chlorin e6 conjugated to pentalysine showed in vitro activity against all oral microorganisms tested, including porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, actinomyces viscosus, and the streptococci. potent  antimicrobial activity (>/=5-log-unit reduction in the numbers of cfu per milliliter) was retained in the presence of up to 25% whole sheep blood. the use  of potent, selective agents such as this chlorin e6-pentalysine conjugate to more effectively reduce the pathogenic bacteria in the periodontal pocket may be a significant tool for the treatment of periodontal disease.

AB  == the present study investigated a recently developed automated image analysis technique for its applicability to the enumeration of selected bacteria in supragingival dental plaque. following initial calibration, the system is capable to count fluorescence-labeled target cells in up to 48 samples without user interference. test samples contained a characteristic mixture of planktonic bacteria, small almost planar bacterial aggregates, and large, virtually indisruptable clumps with cells from multiple species. due to their complex composition, these samples provided a challenging validation step for the image analysis system. automated enumeration of target bacteria was compared with visual counting of the fluorescence-labeled bacteria. results are shown for six taxa (actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia/prev. nigrescens, streptococcus gordonii/strep. oralis/strep. sanguis, strep. sobrinus, and veillonella dispar/ v. parvula) with characteristic differences in abundance, cell morphology and aggregation behavior. results revealed good correspondence between the two enumeration techniques (correlation  coefficients ranging from 0.77 to 0.92) provided that the portion of target bacteria exceeded 0.05% of the total bacterial cell number. this work demonstrates the applicability and usefulness of fully automated immunofluorescence to analyze such complex ecosystems as supragingival dental plaque.

AB  == background: although extensive microbial analyses have been performed from subgingival plaque samples of periodontitis patients, systematic analysis of subgingival microbiota has not been carried out in a korean population so far. the purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence of major putative periodontopathogens in korean patients by culture-independent methods. methods: a total of 244 subgingival plaque samples (5 sites in each participant) were taken  from 29 advanced adult periodontitis (ap) patients and 20 periodontally healthy subjects. ap samples were obtained from the 4 deepest periodontal pockets (> or =6 mm probing depth [pd]) and 1 healthy site (< or =3 mm pd) in each patient. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) of 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) of subgingival plaque bacteria was performed with eubacterial primers. aliquots of pcr products were then applied on nylon membranes and hybridized with specific oligonucleotide probes labeled with digoxigenin. results: all diseased sites harbored fusobacterium sp., while porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema sp., and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 96% of 116 diseased sites. peptostreptococcus micros, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia were present in 82%, 74%, and 71% of diseased sites, respectively. in  sites of periodontally healthy subjects, fusobacterium sp. was present in the highest proportion (58%). treponema sp., p. gingivalis, and b. forsythus were detected in 22%, 18%, and 18% of healthy sites, respectively. p. micros, p. intermedia, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were found in 8%, 2%, and 1% of healthy  sites, respectively. the prevalence of the periodontopathogens, with the exceptions of fusobacterium sp. and b. forsythus, was significantly higher in the healthy sites of periodontitis subjects than in the healthy sites of periodontally healthy subjects (p <0.05). conclusions: using highly sensitive methods relying on 16s ribosomal rna-based oligonucleotide probes, we confirmed the strong association of 7 putative periodontopathogens with ap patients in a korean population. with the exceptions of fusobacterium sp. and b. forsythus, all the periodontopathogens were significantly more associated with the healthy sites of periodontitis subjects than in the healthy sites of periodontally healthy subjects.

AB  == periodontal disease and tooth loss is a common finding among advanced hiv+ patients. in addition to local oral lipopolysaccharide (lps) stimulation, systemic up-regulation of monocyte pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion may also be involved in the pathogenesis of hiv disease. a study was undertaken to investigate il-1beta, il-6 and tnf-alpha production by resting and lps stimulated monocytes isolated from hiv+ patients and also to investigate the relationship of the patient's hiv viral load status to the cytokine production. whole blood samples in edta were collected from 39 hiv-1 infected patients and 20 age and sex matched uninfected controls. plasma was separated by centrifugation. viral load was determined using a quantitative rt-pcr. monocytes were isolated by ficoll-hypaque gradient separation followed by overnight plastic adherence. cultured monocytes (1x10(6)/ml) were stimulated with lps (1 microg/ml) of either  p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum for 2, 8, 24 and 48 h and supernatant fluids were collected. il-1beta, il-6, and tnf-alpha levels in supernatant fluids were estimated by elisa. increased overall production of il-1beta, il-6 and tnf-alpha  by lps stimulated monocytes isolated from hiv-1 infected patients was observed when compared to hiv-1 uninfected controls. lps stimulated monocytes from hiv-1 infected patients with high viral load (hvl) produced significant (p<0.05) elevations in these pro-inflammatory cytokines when compared to hiv-1 uninfected  controls. both lps of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum produced a comparable cytokine production by monocytes after 8 h of stimulation. these data suggest that enhanced il-1beta, il-6 and tnf-alpha is produced by monocytes/macrophages isolated from hvl hiv+ patients and may be involved in the overall pathogenesis of hiv-1 infection.

AB  == aims: the colonization of suspected periodontal pathogens during the healing of periodontal defects treated by guided tissue regeneration (gtr) with e-ptfe membranes and tetracycline fibers was investigated. methods: fifteen patients, each with one pair of angular periodontal bone defects of comparable size and morphology were recruited for the study. in a matched-pair study design, the test defects were treated with e-ptfe membranes in combination with tetracycline fibers, while control defects were treated with e-ptfe membranes alone. microbiological specimens were taken from control as well as from test sites preoperatively (t0), intraoperatively (t1), two weeks after surgery (t2) and from membranes at time of removal (t3). cultural methods were used to identify the following species: porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) and actinobacillus actinomicetemcomitans (aa). results: at baseline and t1, none of the suspected periodontal pathogens were detected at test or control sites. levels of p. intermedia and f. nucleatum, as mean percentages of total culturable microflora, were detected at levels significantly higher in control sites than test sites at times t2 and t3. conclusions: findings from this study suggest that e-ptfe membranes are frequently colonized by periodontal pathogens, and that bacterial colonization of healing sites after gtr procedures can be kept under control with a controlled delivery system releasing tetracycline.

TI  == "checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  == background: we explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum igg responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. methods: one hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients  aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject;  2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic dna probes. serum igg antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. results: cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of eikenella corrodens, veillonella  parvula, and actinomyces naeslundii in controls. cases displayed higher igg levels against p. gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against f. nucleatum, t. denticola, e. nodatum,  and capnocytophaga ochracea. positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. in cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species  out of which only one was positive (v. parvula). both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. a logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. conclusion: a combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.

TI  == characterization of bacterial orofacial infections using a new murine model.
AB  == we devised a new murine orofacial infection model using bacteria from odontogenic infection origins and characterized the experimental infections. in this model, bacteria were injected into the submandible of mice. streptococcus constellatus and peptostreptococcus micros produced a single abscess at the injection site and their abscess-forming and lethal abilities were low: the median abscess-forming dose (af(50)) of s. constellatus and p. micros were 10(8.5-10.7)and 10(10.2-10.6)cfu/mouse, and their median lethal dose (ld(50)) were >11 and 10(10.6-11)cfu/mouse, respectively. prevotella oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum produced multiple abscesses and their abscess-forming and lethal abilities were strong: af(50)of p. oralis and f. nucleatum were 10(6.0-6.4)and 10(7. 0-8.7)cfu/mouse, and their ld(50)were 10(7.0-7.7)and 10(8.3-9. 9)cfu/mouse, respectively. ld(50)of p. intermedia and p. gingivalis were 10(9.4->11)and 10(8.9-9.1)cfu/mouse, respectively. prevotella intermedia and porphyromonas gingivalis generated a necrotizing lesion, which progressed rapidly. we conclude  that this murine model could reflect human orofacial odontogenic infections and is useful to investigate the pathogenicity of causative bacteria of such infections.

TI  == interleukin-1 receptor signaling rather than that of tumor necrosis factor is critical in protecting the host from the severe consequences of a polymicrobe anaerobic infection.
AB  == infection of the dental pulp leads to an osteolytic lesion that results from a polymicrobial infection consisting largely of pathogenic anaerobes. infection causes significant morbidity and mortality mediated by bacterial factors and in some cases by the up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines. the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (il-1) and tumor necrosis factor (tnf), in particular, play a complex and central role in the responses to microbial pathogens. however, relatively little is known about the significance of these cytokines in protecting the host from focal polymicrobial anaerobic infections. to establish the relative importance of il-1 and tnf in mediating the response to a mixed anaerobic infection, we inoculated the dental pulp of mice with six anaerobic pathogens containing functional deletions of receptors to il-1 (il-1r1(-/-)), tnf (tnfrp55(-/-)-p75(-/-)), or both (tnfrp55(-/-)-il-1ri(-/-)). the results indicate that il-1 receptor signaling and tnf receptor signaling both play similarly important roles in protecting the host from local tissue damage. however, il-1 receptor signaling is considerably more important than tnf receptor signaling in  preventing the spread of infection into surrounding fascial planes, since il-1r1(-/-) but not tnfrp55(-/-)-p75(-/-) mice exhibited significantly higher morbidity and mortality. moreover, all of the fatal infections occurred in male mice, suggesting the importance of gender differences in limiting the impact of these infections.

TI  == toll-like receptor 4-deficient mice have reduced bone destruction following mixed anaerobic infection.
AB  == c3h/hej mice have an impaired ability to respond to lipopolysaccharide (lps) due  to a mutation in the gene that encodes toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4). the effect of tlr4 deficiency on host responses to endodontic infections is unknown. in the present study, we compared periapical bone destruction, sepsis, and inflammatory  cytokine production in lps-hyporesponsive c3h/hej and wild-type control c3h/heouj mice. the mandibular first molars of both strains were subjected to pulpal exposure and infection with a mixture of four anaerobic pathogens, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus intermedius, and peptostreptococcus micros. at sacrifice on day 21, tlr4-deficient c3h/hej mice had significantly reduced periapical bone destruction compared to wild-type c3h/heouj mice (p < 0.001). the decreased bone destruction in c3h/hej correlated  with reduced expression of the bone resorptive cytokines interleukin 1alpha (il-1alpha) (p < 0.01) and il-1beta (p < 0.05) as well as the proinflammatory cytokine il-12 (p < 0.05). no significant differences were seen in the levels of  gamma interferon, tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), or il-10 between the two strains. the expression of il-1alpha, il-1beta, tnf-alpha, il-10, and il-12 were all significantly reduced in vitro in macrophages from both tlr4-deficient c3h/hej and c57bl/10scncr strains, compared to wild-type controls. notably, the responses of tlr4-deficient macrophages to both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were similarly reduced. neither c3h/hej nor c3h/heouj mice exhibited orofacial abscess development or infection dissemination as determined by splenomegaly or cachexia. we conclude that intact tlr function mediates increased proinflammatory responses and bone destruction in response to mixed anaerobic infections.

TI  == prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing strains among 149 anaerobic gram-negative  rods isolated from periodontal pockets.
AB  == in a prospective study, 47 adults presenting a rapidly progressive periodontitis  were selected in order to evaluate the prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing strains among oral anaerobic gram-negative rods. predominant anaerobes were identified from two of the deepest periodontal pockets. beta-lactamase-positive strains fulfilled to at least two of three criteria: positive nitrocefin test, penicillin etest minimal inhibitory concentration > 1 microgram/ml, and disk diffusion synergy between amoxycillin and clavulanic acid > 10 mm. at least one beta-lactamase-producing strain was found in 53.2% of patients and 39.4% of the periodontal pockets investigated. prominent beta-lactamase-positive species were  prevotella buccae and prevotella intermedia (respectively 16 of 38: 42% and 18 of 52: 35% positive strains), followed by prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella denticola and fusobacterium nucleatum (respectively 1 of 6: 17%, 1 of  10: 10%, 1 of 10: 10%, and 1 of 13: 8% positive strains). no beta-lactamase producer could be evidenced in porphyromonas gingivalis (10 strains tested). all  the beta-lactamase-positive strains with the nitrocefin test had penicillin minimal inhibitory concentrations > 1 microgram/ml with the etest, and a strong synergy between amoxicillin and clavulanic acid was always observed.

TI  == the prevalence of pathogenic periodontal microflora in healthy young adult smokers.
AB  == background: smoking is a major risk factor in periodontitis, although the mechanisms of its effects are not well understood. the overall goal of this clinical study was to determine if smoking enhances the colonization of the oral  cavity by pathogenic bacteria in a periodontitis-free population. the prevalence  of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola was investigated in 25 smokers and 25 non-smokers by using dna probes. methods: the subjects were 21 to 35 years of  age with a healthy periodontium or slight gingivitis and were systemically healthy. the test group included subjects who had a minimum of a 1.5 pack-year history of smoking, while the control subjects never smoked. subgingival plaque samples were taken by paper point following the assessment of multiple clinical parameters. results: this investigation showed: 1) no statistically significant differences were noted in any clinical parameter measured between the groups; 2)  of the 8 subjects who were infected by at least 1 tested pathogen, seven were smokers (p= 0.02); 3) infected smokers had a 15.7+/-3.5 pack-year history and smoked a mean of 27+/-5 cigarettes/day versus 4.4+/-0.8 pack years and 15+/-1 cigarettes/day for the non-infected smokers (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.004); and 4) smokers were 18 times more likely to exhibit the presence of pathogens than non-smokers. conclusions: these data indicate that the prevalence of colonization of the sulcus by pathogenic bacterial species in periodontitis-free individuals is related to the quantity and duration of cigarette smoking.

TI  == inducible expression of human beta-defensin 2 by fusobacterium nucleatum in oral  epithelial cells: multiple signaling pathways and role of commensal bacteria in innate immunity and the epithelial barrier.
AB  == human gingival epithelial cells (hge) express two antimicrobial peptides of the beta-defensin family, human beta-defensin 1 (hbd-1) and hbd-2, as well as cytokines and chemokines that contribute to innate immunity. in the present study, the expression and transcriptional regulation of hbd-2 was examined. hbd-2 mrna was induced by cell wall extract of fusobacterium nucleatum, an oral commensal microorganism, but not by that of porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontal pathogen. hbd-2 mrna was also induced by the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and phorbol myristate acetate (pma), an epithelial cell activator. hbd-2 mrna was also expressed in 14 of 15 noninflamed  gingival tissue samples. hbd-2 peptide was detected by immunofluorescence in hge  stimulated with f. nucleatum cell wall, consistent with induction of the mrna by  this stimulant. kinetic analysis indicates involvement of multiple distinct signaling pathways in the regulation of hbd-2 mrna; tnf-alpha and f. nucleatum cell wall induced hbd-2 mrna rapidly (2 to 4 h), while pma stimulation was slower ( approximately 10 h). in contrast, each stimulant induced interleukin 8 (il-8) within 1 h. the role of tnf-alpha as an intermediary in f. nucleatum signaling was ruled out by addition of anti-tnf-alpha that did not inhibit hbd-2 induction. however, inhibitor studies show that f. nucleatum stimulation of hbd-2 mrna requires both new gene transcription and new protein synthesis. bacterial lipopolysaccharides isolated from escherichia coli and f. nucleatum were poor stimulants of hbd-2, although they up-regulated il-8 mrna. collectively, our findings show inducible expression of hbd-2 mrna via multiple pathways in hge in  a pattern that is distinct from that of il-8 expression. we suggest that different aspects of innate immune responses are differentially regulated and that commensal organisms have a role in stimulating mucosal epithelial cells in maintaining the barrier that contributes to homeostasis and host defense.

TI  == in vitro volatile sulfur compound production of oral bacteria in different culture media.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to detect the relative contribution of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia in the production of oral malodor. method and materials: the volatile sulfur compounds produced by these bacteria in vitro were measured semiquantitatively by a portable sulfide monitor. results: samples from the tongue, tonsils, and pharynx showed a significantly higher production (550 ppb) of volatile sulfur compounds during the first 6 hours after anaerobic incubation in broths (brain-heart infusion, columbia, and trypticase soy) than after incubation in agar media (300 ppb) (p < 0.001). after 24 hours, values in broths and agars leveled off at 350 ppb (p = 0.3) and remained constant during the next 6 days. measurement of separate pure cultures showed that maximal volatile sulfur compound production was reached 6 hours after incubation (450 ppb for the 3 bacteria). higher volatile sulfur compound values were measured in brain-heart infusion. when measurements of mixed cultures of the 3 pathogens were performed every 15 minutes, the maximal value was reached after only 30 minutes of incubation (nearly 500 ppb). conclusion: the in vitro volatile sulfur compound production of oral samples is preferably measured in broths. maximal sulfur production from mixed cultures is reached after 30 minutes of incubation. samples should always be inoculated at the same dilution.

TI  == peptostreptococcus micros coaggregates with fusobacterium nucleatum and non-encapsulated porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == coaggregation is one of the potential colonization strategies of oral microorganisms, often involving fimbrial structures in the interactions. in this  study, the coaggregation characteristics of the rough and smooth genotypes of the periodontal pathogen peptostreptococcus micros were compared to investigate the role of the fibril-like structures of the rough genotype in coaggregation. of the 11 oral species tested, only fusobacterium nucleatum strains and non-encapsulated porphyromonas gingivalis strains coaggregated with p. micros. no differences in coaggregation between the smooth type (sm), the rough type (rg) and the smooth variant of the rg type (rg(sm)) of p. micros were observed. heat-stable, periodate-sensitive structures on p. micros appeared to interact with heat- and protease-sensitive structures on f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. these data indicate that these unimodal coaggregations are not mediated by the proteinaceous fibril-like structures of the rg genotype, but by carbohydrates present on both genotypes of p. micros.

TI  == longitudinal study of dental implants in a periodontally compromised population.
AB  == background: the purpose of this longitudinal study was to determine the clinical  status and the composition of the subgingival microbiota of dental implants and natural teeth in patients with a history of periodontitis. methods: twenty-five partially edentulous patients treated for moderate to advanced adult periodontitis and having a total of 42 implants participated in this 3-year study. the assessment of clinical status was done 1, 2, and 3 years after prosthetic loading (t1, t2, and t3, respectively). clinical parameters evaluated  included probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), gingival index (gi), and plaque index (pi). the subgingival microbiota at peri-implant and periodontal sites were analyzed at t1 and t2. results: no significant difference  in clinical parameters between implants and teeth and within the 2 groups between different time points was observed through the study. pd and cal measurements of  sampled periodontal and peri-implant sites did not show any statistically significant difference through the study and between the 2 groups. pi of sampled  periodontal sites showed a statistically significant improvement during the study. from the morphological observation of the subgingival microbiota, a significant difference in the composition of motile rods between implants and teeth was found at t1. there were no differences detected in the subgingival microbiota, culturally identified at peri-implant and periodontal sites for the duration of the study. conclusions: in conclusion, implants were colonized by the indigenous periodontal microbiota and were well maintained in patients with a history of periodontitis. no significant association between progressing or non-progressing periodontal or peri-implant sampled sites in terms of loss of attachment and infection with at least one of the searched periodontal pathogens  was found, suggesting that the presence of putative periodontopathogens at peri-implant and periodontal sites may not be associated with future attachment loss or implant failure.

TI  == enhanced interleukin-8 production in thp-1 human monocytic cells by lipopolysaccharide from oral microorganisms and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.
AB  == granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf) has been used to assist in bone marrow recovery during cancer chemotherapy. interleukin-8 (il-8) plays an important role in macrophage mediated inflammatory processes including exacerbation of periodontal diseases, one of the most common complications in gm-csf receiving cancer patients. the effect of gm-csf supplementation on il-8 production was investigated in a human monocyte cell line thp-1, stimulated with  lipopolysaccharide extracted from two oral microorganisms, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum. resting thp-1 cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (1 microgram/ml) of p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum and/or gm-csf (50 iu/ml) for varying time periods. the production of il-8 in thp-1 cells was measured by a solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). a very low level of the cytokine il-8 was produced constitutive in thp-1 cells. starting from 8 h of treatment and afterwards gm-csf alone significantly increased il-8 production in thp-1 cells. lipopolysaccharide (1 microgram/ml) extracts from either f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis amplified il-8 production 500-800 times in comparison to resting thp-1 cells. when lipopolysaccharide of f. nucleatum or p.  gingivalis was supplemented with 50 iu/ml of gm-csf, there was a statistically significant enhanced production of il-8 by thp-1 cells after 1 day to 7 days of treatment as compared with lipopolysaccharide treatment alone. gm-csf (50 iu/ml)  also significantly increased il-8 production from 2-7 days of treatment of thp-1  cells when supplemented with a positive control, phorbol-12-myristate-13 acetate  (pma), as compared to pma treatment alone. these investigations using the in vitro thp-1 human monocyte cell model indicate that there may be an increase in the response on a cellular level to oral endotoxin following gm-csf therapy as evidenced by enhanced production of the tissue-reactive inflammatory cytokine, il-8.

TI  == microbiological response of localized sites with recurrent periodontitis in maintenance patients treated with tetracycline fibers.
AB  == background: whether adjunctive tetracycline fibers can provide an additive effect to scaling and root planing in treating non-responsive sites in maintenance subjects is still controversial. recolonization of the bacteria from untreated sites or from the extracrevicular region may explain the insignificant response to local therapy. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the microbiological response of sites treated with tetracycline fibers combined with  scaling and root planing. methods: the study was conducted in a split-mouth design. thirty patients on maintenance therapy having at least 2 non-adjacent sites in separate quadrants with probing depths between 4 to 8 mm with bleeding on probing, or aspartate aminotransferase enzyme levels > 800 microiu in the gingival crevicular fluid, were treated with scaling and root planing plus tetracycline fibers or with scaling and root planing only. subgingival plaque samples were collected at baseline, and 1, 3, and 6 months following treatment. a. actino-mycetemcomitans, c. rectus, b. forsythus, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, and p. intermedia were detected by culture, immunofluorescence, or pcr technique. results: there was a reduction of total bacterial cell count, as well as of certain periodontal pathogens, following treatment. the prevalence of  a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. forsythus, and p. gingivalis and the mean proportions of c. rectus, p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, and p. gingivalis decreased after therapy, but there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 treatment groups with respect to bacterial proportions or the number of positive sites. besides, the pathogens could not be eliminated from the periodontal pocket, and recolonization of the pocket was noted at 3 months post-treatment. conclusions: bacteria located within the cheek, tongue mucosa, saliva, or untreated sites may contribute to reinfection of the pockets and explain the insignificant response to local tetracycline therapy.

TI  == the effects of hiv viral load on the phagocytic activity of monocytes activated with lipopolysaccharide from oral microorganisms.
AB  == a study was undertaken to determine whether viral load status in hiv+ patients has any potential effect on monocyte phagocytic function both before and after challenge of the monocytes with lipopolysaccharide (lps) isolated from oral microorganisms. lps of two putative periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) and fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum) was prepared. whole blood samples in edta were collected from 30 hiv+ patients presenting for dental care at the university of maryland. control samples were prepared from appropriate uninfected individuals. viral load was determined using quantitative rt-pcr (amplicor, roche diagnostics). phagocytic function was determined using fitc labeled saccharomyces species in resting isolated monocytes and in cells after 24 h stimulation with 1 microgram/ml of lps of p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum. immunohistochemical staining was performed for complement receptor cr-1 (cd-35) on phagocyte cells. in hiv+ patients with high viral load (> 10,000 copies/ml), 13.5% of isolated resting monocytes demonstrated phagocytic activity, while 23% of the resting control monocytes from non-infected individuals showed phagocytic function. when the monocytes were stimulated with 1 microgram/ml of lps of f. nucleatum, phagocytic activity was observed in 18.5% of monocytes in patients with high viral load, 33.5% with moderate viral load (400-10,00 copies/ml) and 51% with low viral load (<400 copies/ml), while 62% of  the control monocytes demonstrated phagocytic activity. stimulation of monocytes  with lps of p. gingivalis showed similar results. complement receptor cd-35 showed a 50% decrease in expression in hiv+ patients with high viral load. a progressive decrease in monocyte/macrophage phagocytic function and cd-35 expression with and without oral lps activation occurs after hiv infection and this trend appears to be accentuated in patients with high viral load. this relationship may contribute to increased susceptibility to oral opportunistic infections in advanced hiv+ patients.

TI  == oral microflora in subjects with reduced salivary secretion.
AB  == it is generally assumed that a decreased salivary secretion rate will promote plaque accumulation and increase the risk for caries, gingival inflammation, and  mucosal infections. in this study, the effect of hyposalivation on the oral microflora was examined. the following micro-organisms were analyzed in rinsing samples from 14 subjects with hyposalivation: the total number of anaerobically growing micro-organisms, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, mutans streptococci, lactobacilli, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, and enterics. the study group, age 53 +/- 7 years, had no history of radiation therapy and showed no signs of inflammation in their salivary glands on biopsy. all were dentate with a mean of 24 +/- 3 teeth. their salivary secretion rates were 0.03 +/- 0.02 ml/min  (unstimulated) and 0.84 +/- 0.65 ml/min (stimulated). the control group was matched to the hyposalivation group according to age, sex, and number of teeth. there was a significantly increased number of lactobacilli, and a tendency, not statistically significant and with large variations within the groups, toward a higher proportion of mutans streptococci and a lower proportion of alpha-hemolytic streptococci in the hyposalivation group. the presence of micro-organisms associated with gingival inflammation and mucosal infections was  comparable with that in the healthy controls. the results indicated that a low salivary secretion rate mainly promotes a flora associated with the development of caries.

AB  == although laboratory studies are not necessarily predictive of clinical activity;  they can help to elucidate mechanisms underlying clinical activity when the latter has been established. in a recent clinical study, an essential oil mouthrinse (listerine antiseptic) was shown to be significantly more effective than an amine fluoride/stannous fluoride mouthrinse (meridol) in inhibiting supragingival plaque formation. this paper reports the results of laboratory studies comparing the antimicrobial effectiveness of these 2 mouthrinses using a  kill kinetics assay and a plaque biofilm kill assay. in both assays, the essential oil mouthrinse was considerably more effective than the amine fluoride/stannous fluoride mouthrinse. these findings are consistent with the results of the clinical trial and may help to explain the observed differences in clinical activity.

AB  == the aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical and microbiological  effects of initial periodontal therapy in conjunction with systemic amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid in adult periodontitis patients using a double-blind, parallel-group, and placebo-controlled protocol. 21 patients with a clinical diagnosis of generalised adult periodontitis were recruited. clinical measurements and microbiological assessments were carried out at baseline, 3, and 12 months post-treatment. approximately 6 weeks after initial periodontal treatment (3-6 h), patients were randomly assigned to receive coded study medication of 500 mg amoxicillin plus 125 mg clavulanic acid (augmentin) or placebo, every 8 h for 10 days. patients returned for follow-up visits 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after completion of the medication. the mean plaque index (pi) at baseline was 1.1 for placebo group and 0.9 for the test group. at 3 months, the pi had dropped to 0.3 in both groups, and was maintained during the rest of the study. the changes in bleeding on probing (bop) and gingival index (gi) in the course of the study were similar in both groups. the mean whole mouth probing pocket depth (ppd) in the placebo group was 3.8 mm at baseline and 3.9 mm in the  test group. a mean reduction of 1.0 mm in the placebo group and 0.9 mm in the test group was observed during the first 3 months. no further reduction in ppd was noticed during the study period in either group. there was no statistically significant difference in the ppd reduction between the 2 groups. the change in clinical attachment level (cal) from baseline to 3 months amounted to 0.5 mm in both groups. between 3 and 12 months, the cal changed in neither group. in both groups, treatment resulted in a decrease in the number of spirochetes and motile  rods in positive patients, but no significant differences between either group were noted in any of the dark field microscopy observations. at baseline, 1 patient in the placebo group and 2 patients in the test group were culture positive for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa). after therapy, aa was not detectable in the placebo group and 1 patient remained positive in the test group. in the placebo group, the number of patients positive for porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) decreased from 7 to 2 after therapy. in the test group, the 4 patients positive for pg at baseline remained positive after therapy. in both groups, all subjects were positive for prevotella intermedia (pi) and fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) at baseline. at 12 months, all subjects had detectable subgingival fn. 9 out of the 11 placebo and 8 of the 10 test patients  remained positive for pi. there were no differences in detection frequency of peptostreptococcus micros (pm) and bacteroides forsythus (bf) in both groups between baseline, 3, and 12 months post-treatment. the findings demonstrated that, in comparison to placebo, systemic amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid provided no additional clinical and microbiological effects in the treatment of adult periodontitis patients.

TI  == flow cytometry to monitor phagocytosis and oxidative burst of anaerobic periodontopathogenic bacteria by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  == the reduced susceptibility to phagocytosis found among some periodontopathogenic  anaerobes may account for the differences between invasive and non-invasive strains. we applied flow cytometry as a powerful tool to analyze and quantify phagocytosis using standardized cultures of oral anaerobes (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, p. nigrescens, capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus micros) and heparinized whole blood. bacteria were labeled by a fluorescein-methylester and their esterase activity, resulting in green fluorescence. ingested bacteria could be detected easily and quantified by a shift towards green fluorescence in  the pmnl population involved and a concomitant decrease in the bacterial population. furthermore, the oxidative burst of pmnls was detected in parallel assays using the dye dhr123 which becomes fluorescent upon oxidation during the oxidative burst process. we found a great diversity in phagocytosis susceptibility determined by estimating the portion of phagocytosing pmnls, ranging from 10.6% (strain w83) to > 99.4% (e.g. atcc 33277t) in p. gingivalis and from 15.9% (strain mh5) to > 95% (atcc 33563t) in p. nigrescens. in contrast, almost all p. intermedia strains as well as the representatives of the other anaerobic, putative periodontopathic species tested showed no or only moderate resistance in the phagocytosis assay. comparison of clinical data of patients and the extent of phagocytosis resistance of the corresponding p. gingivalis strains  suggests that this virulence factor may contribute to the clinical outcome.

TI  == the effects of histatin-derived basic antimicrobial peptides on oral biofilms.
AB  == susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is strongly reduced by the formation of complex biofilms. we investigated whether synthetic histatin analogs with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro were also active against these complex mixtures of bacteria, as present in saliva and plaque. in a simplified model system for dental plaque, hydroxyapatite discs were placed in a  continuous culture system comprised of streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia. ex situ treatment of the biofilms formed on these discs with 100 microg/ml of peptide dhvar4 significantly reduced facultative anaerobic, total anaerobic, and obligate anaerobic gram-negative counts with 0.8, 0.5, and 0.5 log units, respectively. ex vivo treatment of salivary bacteria gave reductions of 0.4, 0.7, and 1.5 log units, respectively. for ex vivo treatment of plaque bacteria, reductions of 0.4, 0.4, and 1.4 log units, respectively, were found. in both saliva and plaque samples, obligate anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were significantly more susceptible to dhvar4 than facultatively anaerobic or anaerobic bacteria as a whole (p=0.013 and p=0.018, for salivary bacteria, and p=0.021 and p=0.020 for plaque bacteria, respectively). although the oral bacteria are protected by biofilm formation, the synthetic histatin analog caused a significant reduction of viable counts in a model for oral biofilm as well as in isolated oral biofilms.

TI  == effects of hydrogen peroxide on growth and selected properties of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == in this study we first evaluated the effects of hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) on growth and selected properties of porphyromonas gingivalis, and compared them with those obtained by a reducing agent (cysteine). the growth of p. gingivalis was only moderately affected when h2o2 was added at concentrations up to 30 mm in a complex culture medium. however, when a defined basal medium was used, h2o2 at  a concentration of 3 mm completely inhibited growth of p. gingivalis. incorporation of cysteine at concentrations up to 30 mm in both media had no effect on growth. the effects of h2o2 and cysteine on cell-associated hemagglutinating and arg-gingipain activities were evaluated using bacteria grown in the complex culture medium. both activities were strongly decreased when h2o2  was added in the assay mixtures. this inhibitory effect of h2o2 was reversible. on the other hand, including cysteine in the assay mixtures increased both activities. h2o2 and cysteine had no effect on the expression of heat shock protein (hsp)-68 and hsp-75 by p. gingivalis, as determined by sds-page and western immunoblotting analysis. in the second part of the study, we tested whether growth of selected oral bacterial species may modify the oxidation-reduction potential (eh) of the environment. it was found that certain  species were able to either decrease (p. gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus mutans) or increase (streptococcus sanguis) the eh of the medium. our study provides evidence that an oxidizing agent such as h2o2 may affect the biology of p. gingivalis. moreover, growth of some members of the oral microflora can generate oxidizing and reducing conditions, and thus potentially influence the ecology of subgingival sites by affecting strictly anaerobic bacteria such as p. gingivalis.

TI  == periodontal bacteria in adult twins.
AB  == background: both environmental and genetic factors are known to influence clinical measures of periodontal disease. the purpose of this study was to determine whether genetic factors similarly influence the presence of specific periodontal bacteria in subgingival plaque. methods: reared-together and reared-apart monozygous (mz) and dizygous (dz) adult twins were examined clinically. demographic and behavioral information was obtained from each subject by questionnaire. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from the index teeth,  and the presence of p. intermedia, p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, e. corrodens, and f. nucleatum was determined using an immunoassay. results: microbiological and clinical data were available for 169 twin pairs. the subject-based prevalences of the bacteria in the twin groups ranged from 11% for  porphyromonas gingivalis to 40% for f. nucleatum. for all species examined, the concordance rates were not significantly different (p > 0.05) between mz and dz twin groups. these findings were apparent despite similar smoking histories, self-reported oral hygiene practices, and antibiotic use in the twin groups. furthermore, mz twins reared together were not more similar than mz reared-apart  twins with respect to any bacterial species examined. conclusions: these findings suggest that in a population with access to routine dental care, any effects that host genes and the early family environment have on the presence of specific bacteria in subgingival plaque are not apparent in adulthood. most twins with disease in this study had early periodontitis. results from this study may not necessarily be extrapolated to more advanced disease states.

TI  == induction of anti-thymocyte/t lymphocyte antibodies in mice injected with lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == we examined the levels of anti-thymocyte/t lymphocyte autoantibody (ata) in the serum of mice injected intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharides (lps) from periodontopathic bacteria; porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga ochracea, and non-oral escherichia coli. all of the lps induced igm-ata. among these, lps from  c. ochracea induced the highest level of igm-ata, whereas that of p. gingivalis induced the lowest. the peritoneal t lymphocytes of mice injected with lps were bound by igm-ata. peritoneal b-1 (cd5+b) cells stimulated by each lps produced much more igm-ata than splenic b-2 (cd5-b) cells, suggesting that b-1 cells might be responsible for the production of these antibodies. serum of mice injected with c. ochracea and f. nucleatum lps showed cytotoxicity against thymocytes in the presence of rabbit complements. binding and cytotoxicity were confirmed by igm purified from serum of the mice injected with c. ochracea lps. furthermore, serum of mice treated with c. ochracea, f. nucleatum or a. actinomycetemcomitans  lps inhibited the proliferation of thymocytes. however, purified igm from the serum of mice treated with c. ochracea lps failed to produce the same inhibition. our results suggest that lps from certain species of periodontopathic bacteria can induce igm-ata in the serum and these antibodies may modulate the local immune network in periodontal tissues.

TI  == microbiota of successful osseointegrated dental implants.
AB  == background: the long-term survival of dental implants depends, in part, on control of bacterial infection in the peri-implant region. periodontal pathogens  colonized implants symptomatic through infection, whereas the microbiota of successful implants was similar to that of periodontal health. this study examined the impact on the peri-implant microbiota of crown restorations; implant type; length of time of loading; history of implant or periodontal infections; and whether implants replaced single or multiple teeth. it was of particular interest to evaluate implant colonization by species in a newly described red complex of periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus. methods: this study sampled 43 partially edentulous subjects with successfully osseointegrated titanium root-form dental implants. eighty-one (81)  non-submerged and 20 submerged asymptomatic implants, 83 crowned, and 36 uncrowned teeth were sampled from peri-implant or subgingival sites. the microbiota of samples was evaluated using whole genomic dna probes in a checkerboard assay to 23 subgingival species. results: implants were colonized principally by oral streptococci, capnocytophagae, veillonella parvula, peptostreptococcus micros, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the periodontal species,  p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and campylobacter rectus were detected in a few subjects. the microbiota around crowned implants and crowned teeth was similar. streptococcus oralis, p. intermedia, and selenomonas noxia were elevated in samples from uncrowned teeth compared to crowned teeth and implants. microbial complexity increased as loading time increased, but colonization by periodontal pathogens, including red complex  species, was higher in subjects with previous periodontal disease. no differences were observed in the microbiota of 1- and 2-stage implants, or between implants supporting single or multiple restorations. conclusions: while presence of crowns had only a minor impact on the peri-implant microbiota, microbial changes were observed the longer the implants had been in function and in those patients with  a history of periodontal or peri-implant infections. a history of periodontitis had a greater impact on the peri-implant microbiota than implant loading time. the major influence on the peri-implant microbiota was, however, the microbiota on remaining teeth. p. gingivalis and b. forsythus, red complex periodontal pathogens, colonized several implants, although all implants were successfully osseointegrated.

TI  == interleukin-6 production by human monocytes treated with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in the presence of lipopolysaccharide of oral microorganisms.
AB  == this study focused on the effect of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf) and lipopolysaccharide of the putative periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis or fusobacterium nucleatum on il-6 production by thp-1 cells (a human monocytic cell line). resting thp-1 cells were alternatively treated with gm-csf (50 iu/ml) and lipopolysaccharide of p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum, in varying concentrations for varying time periods. il-6 production in supernatant fluids of treated cells was evaluated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) and a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) was used to evaluate gene expression. untreated thp-1 cells did not produce il-6 as determined by elisa. rt-pcr also failed to detect il-6 mrna in untreated thp-1 cells, indicating that il-6 was not constitutively produced. after stimulation of thp-1 cells with lipopolysaccharide of f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis, il-6 was produced, peaking at 4 h (200-300 pg/ml) and thereafter sharply declining by 8 h. when gm-csf was added together with lipopolysaccharide  of p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum, there was a synergistic quantitative increase in production of il-6 as measured by elisa as compared with lipopolysaccharide alone. il-6 mrna was detected by rt-pcr, 15 min after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide of either p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum. gm-csf supplementation with lipopolysaccharide of p. gingivalis shortened the transcription of il-6 mrna to 5 min, a shift which was not observed with lipopolysaccharide of f. nucleatum, possibly indicating a different mechanism of  initiation of transcription. production of il-6 by gm-csf-treated thp-1 cells in  the presence of lipopolysaccharide of oral microorganisms may provide a model for studying the role of macrophages in acute and chronic periodontal diseases, including the clinical periodontal exacerbation as observed in chemotherapy patients receiving gm-csf for bone marrow recovery.

TI  == immune response to fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia in patients  with chronic maxillary sinusitis.
AB  == our objective was to study the immune response to 2 anaerobic bacteria in patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis. immunoglobulin g class antibody titers to fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. serum levels in the patients were determined on the day sinus aspiration for culture was done, and 75 to 90 days later, after  completion of antimicrobial therapy, prevotella intermedia was isolated from 16 aspirates, and f. nucleatum from 12. median antibody levels at day 1 for f. nucleatum and p. intermedia were significantly higher in patients whose serum aspirates harbored these organisms than at days 75 to 90 in those who were cured  (p < .05). however, the levels stayed elevated in the 5 patients who did not improve. the elevated antibody levels to f. nucleatum and p. intermedia, known oral pathogens, suggest a potential pathogenic role for these organisms in chronic maxillary sinusitis.

TI  == coronal leakage: endotoxin penetration from mixed bacterial communities through obturated, post-prepared root canals.
AB  == coronal leakage has been considered as one of the major causes of failure in root canal treatment. bacteria have been shown to penetrate the root canal obturating  materials and influence the periapical tissues. endotoxin, a component of gram-negative bacteria, is a potent inflammatory agent and may be able to penetrate obturating materials faster than bacteria. this in vitro study examined the possible penetration of post-prepared canals by endotoxin and bacterial cells derived from mixed bacterial communities. results showed that both bacteria and endotoxin were able to penetrate the obturating materials in post-prepared canals; however, endotoxin penetration was faster than bacterial. if one speculates that a similar sequence of events occurs clinically, then such a rapid penetration of endotoxin could lead to an early periapical reaction, with subsequent treatment failure and need for retreatment or periapical surgery. the  need for an immediate and proper coronal restoration after root canal treatment is therefore reinforced.

TI  == oral microbial flora in sjogren's syndrome.
AB  == objective: to study presence of microorganisms associated with caries, gingivitis, oral opportunistic infections, and extent of hyposalivation in dentate patients with primary and secondary sjogren's syndrome (ss). methods: an  oral clinical examination was performed. the salivary flow was measured and a rinsing sample analyzed for presence of specific microorganisms. the results were compared to those of healthy controls matched for sex, age, and number of teeth.  results: in patients with undetectable salivary flow at rest, mean number and proportion of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli showed a tendency to be increased, as well as the frequency of candida. they also displayed an increased  proportion of filled surfaces. in contrast, gingivitis and the numbers of microorganisms associated with gingivitis were comparable to those found in the healthy controls. conclusion: patients with ss and severe hyposalivation harbor oral flora associated with the development of caries and frequent presence of retention sites, indicating a need for efficient preventive dental care.

TI  == preparation and characterization of an actinomyces naeslundii aggregation factor  that mediates coaggregation with porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == intergeneric coaggregation is responsible for the complexity of the microbiota in human dental plaque and is believed to be important in the initial bacterial colonization of the human oral cavity. actinomyces naeslundii, an early colonizer of the tooth surface, may enhance subsequent colonization by porphyromonas gingivalis which is associated with adult periodontitis. the purpose of this study was to isolate and characterize the a. naeslundii aggregation factor (anaf) that mediates coaggregation with p. gingivalis. anaf was isolated from a. naeslundii sonic extract (se) by gel filtration on a sephacryl s-400hr, by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on a hitrap octyl sepharose 4ff, and by ion exchange chromatography on a hitrap q. the specific activity increased 12-fold with a yield of 2.5%. sds-page analysis of anaf revealed a protein band of high molecular weight in excess of 200 kda. carbohydrate was detected as the only material coinciding with the protein band, indicating that the anaf was a glycoprotein. immunoblotting analysis indicated that anaf directly bound to p. gingivalis cells. anaf was sensitive to sodium metaperiodate treatment but not to heat or protease treatments. these results suggest that the anaf carbohydrate component mediated coaggregation with p. gingivalis cells. anaf also inhibited coaggregation with other periodontal disease-associated bacteria such as prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga ochracea, but not  streptococci.

AB  == serum antibody specificity to oral micro-organisms was used to delineate the pathogens associated with early-onset periodontal diseases in a turkish population. additionally, comparison of the findings to those derived from a clinically similar us patient population described differences in bacterial specific antibody between these 2 geographic regions. serum from 89 (ljp), 86 (rpp) and 94 (normal) subjects was analyzed (elisa) to determine igg antibody to  14 oral micro-organisms. all ljp patients from turkey exhibited elevated antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans (serotypes c and a significantly increased), while antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 and jp2 (serotype b) were significantly higher in us ljp patients. 50% of the turkish rpp patients also showed elevated anti-a. actinomycetemcomitans antibody, although the us rpp patients exhibited significantly higher antibody levels and frequency of elevated antibody to the a. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes. healthy subjects and ljp and  rpp patients from the us exhibited higher antibody levels to all 3 p. gingivalis  serogroups compared to those from turkey, although, the frequency of elevated antibody to the p. gingivalis serogroups was significantly higher in ljp and rpp  patients from turkey than from the us. interestingly, 87% and 77% of the ljp patients in the turkish population had elevated antibody responses to p. gingivalis and e. corrodens, respectively, which was not observed in the us ljp patients. these data suggested that considerable variation exists in the systemic antibody levels to periodontopathogens between these 2 countries. this supports potential differences in subgingival colonization or antigenic composition of these pathogens between patient populations from different geographical regions.

TI  == analysis of ph-driven disruption of oral microbial communities in vitro.
AB  == previously, a mixed culture chemostat system was used to demonstrate that the ph  generated from carbohydrate metabolism, rather than carbohydrate availability per se, was responsible for the shifts observed in the oral microflora which are associated with high carbohydrate diets and the development of dental caries. the aim of this study was to determine more accurately the microbially generated ph at which such shifts occurred. nine oral bacteria were grown in three independent chemostats, and pulsed with glucose on 10 consecutive days. in one chemostat, ph  control was discontinued for 6 h, and the ph fall was restricted to a minimum value of ph 5.5; the ph fall was arrested in the other two chemostats at either ph 5. 0, or at ph 4.5. when the ph was allowed to fall, the numbers and proportions of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus rhamnosus increased; this increase was directly related to the magnitude of the ph fall. veillonella dispar was the most numerous organism following all glucose pulsing regimes, especially  at low ph. the increase in proportions of acidogenic bacteria was accompanied by  a fall in the proportions of acid-sensitive species (fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus oralis). the counts of these species were relatively stable between ph 5.5 and 4.5, but were markedly reduced when the ph fell below ph 4.5; neisseria subflava could not persist in the culture at ph 4.5 or below. the data suggest that the disruption of communities associated with glucose metabolism and low ph can be explained in  terms of a two-stage process. a fall in ph to a value between ph 5.5 and 4.5 may  allow the enrichment of potentially cariogenic species, whilst permitting species associated with health to remain relatively unaffected. a further reduction in ph (<ph 4.5) may not only enhance the competitiveness of odontopathogens, but inhibit the growth and metabolism of non-caries-associated species. the results also indicate that species other that mutans streptococci or lactobacilli are competitive at ph values low enough to demineralise enamel, and thus suggest that a broader range of micro-organisms may be associated with caries initiation.

TI  == role of fusobacterium nucleatum and coaggregation in anaerobe survival in planktonic and biofilm oral microbial communities during aeration.
AB  == coaggregation is a well-characterized phenomenon by which specific pairs of oral  bacteria interact physically. the aim of this study was to examine the patterns of coaggregation between obligately anaerobic and oxygen-tolerant species that coexist in a model oral microbial community. obligate anaerobes other than fusobacterium nucleatum coaggregated only poorly with oxygen-tolerant species. in contrast, f. nucleatum was able to coaggregate not only with both oxygen-tolerant and other obligately anaerobic species but also with otherwise-noncoaggregating obligate anaerobe-oxygen-tolerant species pairs. the effects of the presence or absence of f. nucleatum on anaerobe survival in both the biofilm and planktonic phases of a complex community of oral bacteria grown in an aerated (gas phase, 200 ml of 5% co2 in air x min-1) chemostat system were then investigated. in the  presence of f. nucleatum, anaerobes persisted in high numbers (>10(7) x ml-1 in the planktonic phase and >10(7) x cm-2 in 4-day biofilms). in an equivalent culture in the absence of f. nucleatum, the numbers of black-pigmented anaerobes  (porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella nigrescens) were significantly reduced (p </= 0.001) in both the planktonic phase and in 4-day biofilms, while the numbers of facultatively anaerobic bacteria increased in these communities. coaggregation-mediated interactions between f. nucleatum and other species facilitated the survival of obligate anaerobes in aerated environments.

TI  == anaerobic bacteremia and fungemia in patients undergoing endodontic therapy: an overview.
AB  == oral focal infection, a concept neglected for several decades, is a subject of controversy. recent progress in classification and identification of oral microorganisms has renewed interest in focal infection. the aim of this study was to use phenotypic and genetic methods to trace microorganisms released into the bloodstream during and after endodontic treatment back to their presumed source--the root canal. microbiological samples were taken from the root canals of 26 patients with asymptomatic apical periodontitis of single-rooted teeth. the blood of the patients was drawn during and 10 minutes after endodontic therapy. microorganisms in blood were collected after anaerobic lysis filtration and cultured anaerobically on blood agar plates. the phenotypic methods used for characterization and tracing of microorganisms in blood and root canals were: biochemical and antimicrobial susceptibility test, sds-page of whole-cell soluble proteins, and gas chromatography of cellular fatty acids. phenotypic data were verified by dna restriction patterns and corresponding ribotypes of the root canal and blood isolates by using a computer-assisted system fro gel analysis. all root canals contained anaerobic bacteria. the frequency of bacteremia varied  from 31% to 54%. the microorganisms from the root canal and blood presented identical phenotype and genetic characteristics within the patients examined. these characteristics differed between patients. the present study demonstrated that endodontic treatment can be the cause of anaerobic bacteremia and fungemia.  the phenotypic and genetic methods used appeared valuable for tracing microorganisms in the blood back to their origin.

TI  == oral microbiota in smokers and non-smokers in natural and experimentally-induced  gingivitis.
AB  == the present study primarily aimed at investigating the oral microbiota in smokers and non-smokers with established gingivitis and monitoring its composition during experimental gingivitis. secondly, it aimed at examining whether the composition  of the microbiota is associated with different levels of gingival inflammation during this experimental gingivitis trial. for this purpose, 25 non-dental university students with gingivitis were recruited. 11 subjects were smokers and  14 were non-smokers. after achieving gingival health, they entered a 14-day experimental gingivitis trial. plaque and bleeding were assessed before entering  into the study (intake), at day 0, day 5 and at day 14 of the experiment. microbiological samples from mucosal sites and dental plaque (taken at intake, day 0, and day 14) were analysed for the presence of actinomyces species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus species. at day 14 of the experimental period, the level of plaque formation was not different between smokers and non-smokers, but bleeding scores were lower in smokers than in non-smokers (15% and 30% respectively, p=0.01). the change from natural gingivitis to a state of gingival health and a subsequent change from gingival health to experimentally induced gingivitis was accompanied by quantitative alterations in the cultivable microbiota in both groups. changes were most prominent in the transition from gingival health to experimental gingivitis and were found in dental plaque for actinomyces species, c. rectus, f. nucleatum, and p. intermedia. within the group of non-smokers, a distinction was made between subjects with a 'weak' or 'strong' inflammatory response. no relationship with a  single bacterial species could be established which would likely explain the differences in levels of inflammation. it is concluded that differences in response to experimental gingivitis are not caused by major differences in the composition of the oral microbiota.

TI  == subgingival microbial profile of papillon-lefevre patients assessed by dna-probes.
AB  == the prevalence of 18 selected bacterial species was assessed by means of "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridisation in a group of 12 saudi-arabian adolescents with papillon-lefevre syndrome. a total of 36 tooth sites were investigated. the  patients exhibited severe periodontal disease with deep pockets. all 12 patients  harboured the putative bacterial pathogens p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, p. micros and s. intermedius while t. denticola, b. forsythus, p. nigrescens, e. corrodens, s. noxia and c. rectus were recovered from 11 patients. p. gingivalis was recovered from 9 patients and 18 sites while corresponding figures for a. actinomycetemcomitans were 8 and 19, respectively. a number of the investigated species (b. forsythus, t. denticola, p. intermedia, c rectus) reached high levels (> or =10(6) cells) in more than 1/2 of the patients. on the other hand, bacteria such as a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were infrequently encountered  at high levels in these subgingival samples. in conclusion, the analysis failed to demonstrate a pls-specific profile of the subgingival infection, since the bacterial composition of the sampled sites closely resembled that characterising  deep pockets in adult periodontitis patients.

TI  == experimental root canal infections in conventional and germ-free mice.
AB  == a small animal model was evaluated to study the interrelationships between microorganisms after their implantation in root canals (inferior central incisors) using germ-free (gf) and conventional (cv) mice. the selected microorganisms were: porphyromonas endodontalis (atcc 35406), eubacterium lentum  (atcc 25559), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (atcc 27337), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc 10953), escherichia coli (atcc 25922), and enterococcus faecalis (atcc 4083). only p. anaerobius, e. coli, and e. faecalis, respectively, were able to colonize when inoculated alone into the root canal of both cv and gf mice. e. lentum, when inoculated alone colonized only in cv animals. p. endodontalis and f. nucleatum were unable to colonize in cv and gf animals after single inoculation. it is concluded that the experimental animal model presented herein  is valuable for ecological studies of root canal infections and that only some strict anaerobic bacteria are able to colonize mice root canals when inoculated by themselves alone in pure culture.

TI  == dentilisin activity affects the organization of the outer sheath of treponema denticola.
AB  == prolyl-phenylalanine-specific serine protease (dentilisin) is a major extracellular protease produced by treponema denticola. the gene, prtp, coding for the protease was recently cloned and sequenced (k. ishihara, t. miura, h. k.  kuramitsu, and k. okuda, infect. immun. 64:5178-5186, 1996). in order to determine the role of this protease in the physiology and virulence of t. denticola, a dentilisin-deficient mutant, k1, was constructed following electroporation with a prtp-inactivated dna fragment. no chymotrypsin-like protease activity was detected in the dentilisin-deficient mutant. in addition, the high-molecular-mass oligomeric protein characteristic of the outer sheath of  the organism decreased in the mutant. furthermore, the hydrophobicity of the mutant was decreased, and coaggregation of the mutant with fusobacterium nucleatum was enhanced compared to that of the wild-type organism. the results obtained with a mouse abscess model system indicated that the virulence of the mutant was attenuated relative to that of the wild-type organism. these results suggest that dentilisin activity plays a major role in the structural organization of the outer sheath of t. denticola. the loss of dentilsin activity  and the structural change in the outer sheath affect the pathogenicity of t. denticola.

TI  == subgingival microflora associated with nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to examine the composition of subgingival plaque of 140 periodontal lesions in 35 patients with cardiovascular disorders who were administered nifedipine and manifested nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth (go). age was inversely associated with the go. plaque index and bleeding index showed a significant association with go, while nifedipine dosage and duration of nifedipine therapy were not found to be significant predictors of go. the gingival inflammation as expressed in the logistic regression model by the interaction term color x tone was found to be significantly associated with the go. statistically significant differences between the groups of comparable probing depth and different degrees of go were detected for propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium mortiferum, fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium varium and selenomonas sputigena in deep and enlarged lesions. significantly more frequently isolated were the bacterial species eubacterium alactolyticum, campylobacter concisus, c. gingivalis, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, f. mortiferum, f. nucleatum, and f. varium from the more enlarged lesions (go >3).

TI  == granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor amplification of interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha production in thp-1 human monocytic cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide of oral microorganisms.
AB  == cytokines, including granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf), are used to assist in bone marrow recovery during cancer chemotherapy. interleukin-1beta (il-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) play important roles in inflammatory processes, including exacerbation of periodontal  diseases, one of the most common complications in patients who undergo this therapy. a human monocyte cell line (thp-1) was utilized to investigate il-1beta  and tnf-alpha production following gm-csf supplementation with lipopolysaccharide (lps) from two oral microorganisms, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum. lps of p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum was prepared by a phenol-water extraction method and characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel  electrophoresis and determination of total protein and endotoxin contents. resting thp-1 cells were treated with lps of p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum and/or gm-csf (50 iu/ml) by using different concentrations for various time periods. production of il-1beta and tnf-alpha in thp-1 cells was measured by solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. reverse transcription (rt)-pcr was used to evaluate the gene expression of resting and treated thp-1 cells. il-1beta was not detected in untreated thp-1 cells. il-1beta production was, however, stimulated sharply at 4 h. gm-csf amplified il-1beta production in thp-1 cells treated with  lps from both oral anaerobes. no il-1beta-specific mrna transcript was detected in untreated thp-1 cells. however, il-1beta mrna was detected by rt-pcr 2 h after stimulation of thp-1 cells with lps from both organisms. gm-csf did not shorten the il-1beta transcriptional activation time. gm-csf plus f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis lps activated thp-1 cells to produce a 1.6-fold increase in tnf-alpha  production at 4 h over lps stimulation alone. these investigations with the in vitro thp-1 model indicate that there may be an increase in the cellular immune response to oral endotoxin following gm-csf therapy, as evidenced by production of the tissue-reactive cytokines il-1beta and tnf-alpha.

TI  == acid tolerance and acid-neutralizing activity of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == the tolerance to acid and the acid-neutralizing activity of three important periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum were studied. p. gingivalis strains grew only at neutral  ph and did not utilize glucose, whereas strains of p. intermedia and f. nucleatum could grow under acidic conditions and increased their growth by utilizing glucose. p. gingivalis tended to raise the culture ph during growth. p. intermedia and f. nucleatum raised the culture ph during growth in the absence of glucose, while in the presence of glucose they decreased the ph. resting cell suspensions of all the bacteria raised the ph in the presence of tryptone and casamino acids. acid-neutralizing activity was confirmed by measuring base production at a fixed ph with a ph-stat. during neutralization, the cells produced cytotoxic substrates, ammonia and organic acids (butyric, isobutyric and isovaleric acids by p. gingivalis; isovaleric and succinic acids by p. intermedia; propionic and butyric acids by f. nucleatum). these findings suggest  that deamination of amino acids into ammonia and organic acids occurs simultaneously with base production, resulting in acid neutralization. these results could partially explain the survival of p. intermedia and f. nucleatum in both supragingival and subgingival plaque and the apparent restriction of p. gingivalis to subgingival plaque. the former bacteria may aid in creation of an environment fostering colonization of subgingival plaque by p. gingivalis.

TI  == effect of red blood cells on the growth of porphyromonas endodontalis and microbial community development.
AB  == establishment of a microbial community in the root canal system depends on numerous factors, of which nutrient availability may be one of the most important. we hypothesized that the presence of red blood cells or hemoglobin in  this environment could cause shifts in microbial composition of communities, resulting in organisms such as porphyromonas endodontalis becoming more dominant. an in vitro model system using mixed, batch cultures was performed with the bacteria p. endodontalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros and  campylobacter rectus. bacteria were cultured in media with or without the addition of washed red blood cells, hemoglobin, or serum. cyclic growth studies revealed that p. endodontalis was lost from the community of organisms after three cycles. however, inclusion of red blood cells resulted in establishment of  this organism. moreover, red blood cells added to pure cultures of p. endodontalis substantially enhanced growth and protected the organisms from oxygen. we conclude that the presence of red blood cells could result in shifts of microbial communities of organisms within the root canal system.

TI  == killing of fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia by protegrins.
AB  == protegrins are broad spectrum antibiotic peptides isolated from porcine leukocytes. in this study, we (i) examine the sensitivity of gram-negative, anaerobic periodontal pathogens to synthetic protegrins; (ii) determine the relative potencies of protegrin congeners against these bacteria; and (iii) compare the potency of protegrins with other antibiotic peptides, including magainin msi-78, tachyplesin i, cecropin p1, human defensins hnp-1-3, and clavanin a. synthetic l- and d-enantiomers of protegrin 1 (pg-1 and d-pg-1, respectively), and l-enantiomers of protegrins 2, 3 and 5 (pg-2, pg-3 and pg-5) were tested against fusobacterium nucleatum, and black-pigmented organisms including porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. strains of both f.  nucleatum and the black-pigmented organisms were sensitive to pg-1, and exhibited mean ed99 of 2.2-2.3 micrograms/ml and 3.4-9.9 micrograms/ml, respectively. the d-form was statistically more potent than the l-form against these oral anaerobes, and although this difference in potency is unlikely to be of decisive  therapeutic significance, the d-form may be of value given ability to resist microbial and host-derived proteases. pg-1 was more potent than magainin, tachyplesin, cecropin, defensins and clavanin under test conditions. hypertonic salt concentrations and heat-inactivated serum were found to be inhibitory to the bactericidal activity of pg-1. pg-1 was found to induce morphologic alterations in the ultrastructural appearance of f. nucleatum consistent with damage to the bacterial membranes. we conclude that protegrins may be useful antimicrobial agents in therapy against gram-negative anaerobic bacteria believed to be involved in chronic, adult forms of periodontal infections.

TI  == subgingival distribution of periodontopathic bacteria in adult periodontitis and  their susceptibility to minocycline-hcl.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution of several periodontopathic bacteria in adult periodontitis, their in vitro susceptibility to minocycline-hcl, and whether the efficacy of the drug changes with a decrease  in bacterial susceptibility. twenty-one patients (43 to 75 years old) with 62 periodontal lesions from pockets > or =4 mm participated in the study. after subgingival sampling, an ointment containing 2% minocycline-hcl was applied locally to the selected pockets once a week for 4 weeks. the lesions were clinically examined after 1 and 4 weeks of administration. the distribution of the subgingival microorganisms included capnocytophaga sputigena (37.1%), prevotella intermedia (22.6%), porphyromonas gingivalis (22.6%), fusobacterium nucleatum (20.1%), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (9.7%), and eikenella corrodens (4.8%). the distribution was complex, with 76.8% of the sites containing 1 to 3 bacterial spieces. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of minocycline-hcl for each organism showed that most were inhibited by a minocycline-hcl concentration equal to or less than the mic for reference strains. however, some clinical strains of prevotella intermedia seemed to exihibit low susceptibility to minocycline-hcl. there were no significant differences among sites with strains exhibiting low or normal susceptibility to minocycline-hcl. the concentration of the drug applied to deep periodontal pockets inhibited the growth of most of the microorganisms investigated in this study.

TI  == salivary iga responses to bacteria in dental plaque as related to periodontal and hiv infection status.
AB  == levels of total iga and specific iga reactive with streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum were measured by elisa in parotid saliva from hiv+ and hiv- persons with healthy gingiva (hg), chronic gingivitis, chronic marginal periodontitis (cmp), or necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (nup). when the hiv+ group was compared with the hiv- group regardless of periodontal status, total salivary iga concentration was higher in hiv+ patients, but no such difference was observed for total iga output. hiv+ cmp displayed higher total iga concentration as compared with hiv- cmp. no significant differences in specific iga outputs and ratios were detected  between hiv+ and hiv- subgroups with similar periodontal status. hiv+ nup displayed increased specific iga output towards s. mutans and increased specific  iga ratio values towards s. mutans, p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens as compared with hiv+ cmp, and increased specific iga ratio values towards s. mutans and p. nigrescens as compared with hiv+ hg. no such differences were observed between the hiv- subgroups. in sum, salivary iga responses to bacteria in dental plaque seem not to be related to chronic periodontal disease and hiv infection, but are  possibly influenced by acute periodontal infection.

TI  == subgingival temperature: relation to gingival crevicular fluid enzymes, cytokines, and subgingival plaque micro-organisms.
AB  == there have been no reports on the relationship of subgingival temperature to specific gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) components. therefore, the purpose of this cross-sectional study was to determine whether there was any relationship between subgingival temperature and gcf levels of neutrophil elastase (ne), myeloperoxidase (mpo), beta-glucuronidase (bg), interleukin-1 alpha (il-1), and interferon alpha (ifn). furthermore, another objective was to confirm an association of subgingival temperature with clinical parameters and specific subgingival plaque micro-organisms as has been reported earlier. 27 human subjects each having healthy (n = 50), gingivitis (n = 59) and periodontitis (n = 53) sites were evaluated. the plaque index (pi), subgingival temperature, probing depth, attachment loss, bleeding index and gingival index were measured. gcf was  sampled following the measurement of the pi and removal of the supragingival plaque. gcf samples were assayed for the enzymes ne, bg, mpo and the cytokines ifn-alpha and il-1 alpha. a sterile gracey curette was utilized at each sampled site to collect subgingival plaque. the plaque samples were evaluated using an immunoassay. subgingival temperature was found to directly correlate with all clinical parameters (p < 0.001). significant, albeit not large, correlations were found between subgingival temperature and ne (r = 0.35, p < 0.001), mpo (r = 0.26, p < 0.001) and bg (r = 0.23, p < 0.01). temperature was found to correlate  positively with e. corrodens (r = 0.33, p < 0.02) and f. nucleatum (r = 0.25, p < 0.05) but not with p. intermedia (r = 0.02, p = 0.9), p. gingivalis (r = 0.20, p  = 0.1) and a. actinomycetemcomitans (r = 0.01, p > 0.9). in conclusion, subgingival temperature is correlated with the gcf enzymes, ne, mpo and bg as well as the clinical parameters and specific plaque micro-organisms associated with periodontal disease.

TI  == comparison of the subgingival microbiota of periodontally healthy and diseased adults in northern cameroon.
AB  == our study is the 1st report on subgingival microbiota in adult cameronians. the aim was to investigate, using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique, the prevalence of 18 oral species in subgingival plaque samples obtained from sex- and age-matched cameronian adults with and without periodontal destruction.  we also compared cultivation and the affirm dp test with the checkerboard technique in their capability to detect some selected species among the 18. 21 adult periodontitis patients and 21 periodontally healthy subjects were examined  and the results were compared statistically. each periodontitis patient had at least 4 pockets of > or = 6 mm depth, while the healthy subjects had no sites more than 3 mm deep. results of the checkerboard analysis showed that significantly (p < 0.05) more periodontitis patients tested positive for most of  the 18 bacterial species. the gram-positive species actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis, known as microbiota of healthy sites, were detected significantly more frequently in the healthy group. cultivation demonstrated p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum in significantly lower %s of patients as compared  to the checkerboard technique. furthermore, the affirm dp test detected p. gingivalis and b. forsythus in significantly fewer patients than did the checkerboard technique. a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 52.3% of the patients by the latter technique while the affirm dp test failed to detect the bacterium in any of the samples. overall, the results of the present study confirm the importance of the screening method and indicate that the prevalences  of the investigated putative periodontal pathogens and beneficial species in the  healthy and diseased adult cameronians were similar to those reported for adults  in the west and in some developing countries.

TI  == "checkerboard" versus culture: a comparison between two methods for identification of subgingival microbiota.
AB  == the present study compared the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization methodology with culture techniques for the analysis of the composition of the subgingival microbiota. 70 subjects, presenting with a variety of periodontal conditions, contributed with a total of 283 subgingival plaque samples analyzed with respect  to the following species: porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus,  eikenella corrodens, bacteroides forsythus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans. species identification and quantification was performed by (i) the checkerboard method, using whole genomic, digoxigenin labeled dna probes; and (ii) culture, including non-selective and selective media in combination with routine biochemical testing using commercial  test panels. we found that the checkerboard technology resulted in higher prevalence figures for half of the species tested when compared to culture data.  if the latter were used as the reference, checkerboard detection sensitivities ranged from 0.17 to 0.86, specificities from 0.17 to 1.0, and diagnostic accuracies from 0.51 to 0.81, depending on bacterial species. the use of the checkerboard data as the reference resulted in detection sensitivities for the culture procedures between 0.24 and 1.0 and specificities between 0.21 and 0.87.  the checkerboard methodology resulted in statistically significant higher bacterial counts for the majority of the species. it was further observed that, for most species, the higher the total number colony-forming units in the sample, the higher the discrepancy between the results obtained by the two techniques.

TI  == experimental gingivitis in periodontitis-susceptible subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate clinical, microbiological, and gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) profiles in periodontitis-resistant and periodontitis-susceptible subjects during 4 weeks of experimental gingivitis. experimental groups of similar ages were defined as gingivitis controls (gc; n =  10) and history of rapidly progressive periodontitis (rpp; n = 10), respectively. prior to baseline, all subjects achieved good plaque control (plaque index (p1i)  approximately 0) and gingival health (gingival index (gi) = 0), and had probing depths < or = 4 mm on experimental teeth. for 4 weeks after baseline, oral hygiene around maxillary 2nd premolar and 1st molar teeth was inhibited by a plaque guard. the plaque guard was removed weekly for gcf sampling to determine interleukin (il)-1 beta and prostaglandin (pg)e2 amounts by elisas. in addition,  p1i, gi, probing depth, and gingival recession measurements were made. subgingival plaque darkfield microscopy and dna probe analysis also were performed. results indicated that clinical signs of inflammation, microbiological patterns and gcf profiles progressed similarly in both groups. however, plaque accumulated more rapidly in the susceptible subjects. p1i in rpp at 4 weeks was 2.1 +/- 0.1 compared to 1.5 +/- 0.2 in gc, with an incidence of p1i > of 100% versus 50%, respectively (logistic regression; p < 0.0001). hence, the clinical,  microbiological and host factors selected for this study were unrelated to previous susceptibility to periodontitis when evaluated in the experimental gingivitis model. however, the increased rate of plaque accumulation, following thorough plaque removal, in rpp patients suggests a potential factor in disease recurrence in these susceptible subjects.

TI  == characteristics of systemic antibody responses of nonhuman primates to cell envelope and cell wall antigens from periodontal pathogens.
AB  == the immune response of the primate, macaca fascicularis, to cell envelope (cea) or cell wall (cwa) antigens of several periodontal pathogens was examined to develop a strategy to interfere with ligature-induced periodontitis. animals were parenterally immunized with cea of either porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia or a combination of cea/cwa of campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces viscosus. serum samples were taken every 2-4 weeks over a 4-month period, which included a 13-week interval with molar teeth ligated. all of the nonhuman primates in the study exhibited baseline levels of igg, igm and iga antibody to formalinized whole cells of the bacteria. these levels increased  significantly following immunization and were elevated above baseline throughout  the remainder of the experiment. the largest change in antibody responses was seen in iga antibody levels of p. gingivalis and c. rectus (42-fold above baseline), igm antibody to p. intermedia, (41-fold increase) and igg antibody to  f. nucleatum and a. viscosus (32 and 63-fold increases). moreover, the nonhuman primates exhibited differences in isotype response levels to whole microorganisms compared with the cell envelope antigens. these findings demonstrate the capacity of these nonhuman primates to produce an active immune response to microorganisms chronically colonizing the subgingival microbiota. additionally, it appears that  the bacteria may exhibit some unique differences in their immunogenicity as detected by the nonhuman primate and may contribute to the ability of the immune  responses to effectively interact with these pathogens.

TI  == evidence for serum immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody responses in macaca fascicularis identified by monoclonal antibodies to human igg subclasses.
AB  == this investigation determined the capacity of murine monoclonal antibodies directed to human immunoglobulin g (igg) subclasses to identify molecules with conserved epitopes in the serum of the nonhuman primate, macaca fascicularis. we  subsequently utilized this cross-reactivity to document the characteristics of igg subclass antibody responses in m. fascicularis to parenteral immunization with intact oral microorganisms, antigens from oral microorganisms, and finally a defined protein toxin, tetanus toxoid. the igg response in nonhuman primates immunized with tetanus toxoid showed a 40-fold and 110-fold increase after primary and secondary immunizations, respectively. the major igg subclass responses were igg1 and igg3, with little, though significant, responses in the igg4 and igg2 subclasses. seventy-five to 94% of the natural igg antibody in nonhuman primate sera to porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and campylobacter rectus was igg1. igg2 and igg3 predominated to bacteroides fragilis, igg4 to actinomyces viscosus and an equal distribution among the subclasses was noted in response to fusobacterium nucleatum. parenteral immunization of nonhuman primates with intact p. gingivalis elicited primarily igg3 and igg4, while the post-immunization igg response to p. intermedia was largely igg1. nonhuman primates were also parenterally immunized with cell envelope antigens of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, or a combination of cell envelope antigen from c. rectus and f. nucleatum and cell wall antigens of a. viscosus. the greatest igg antibody response seen post-immunization was reactive  with anti-human igg1 for all of these antigens except to c. rectus which bound nonhuman primate antibody reactive with anti-human igg2. it appears that the bacteria and their products exhibit unique differences in their induction of serum igg subclass antibody responses. the characteristics of their immunogenicity as detected by the nonhuman primate may contribute to the ability  of the immune responses to effectively interact with these pathogens.

TI  == beta-lactamase producing bacteria in adult periodontitis.
AB  == in 23 untreated adult periodontitis patients, the occurrence of beta-lactamase producing periodontal bacteria was determined. in addition to non-selective isolation media, selective isolation and growth of beta-lactamase positive subgingival bacterial species was carried out on blood agar plates supplemented with amoxicillin and plates with amoxicillin+clavulanic acid. porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, peptostreptococcus micros, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides forsythus and campylobacter rectus isolates from the non-selective medium were tested for beta-lactamase activity by a nitrocefin disk method (dryslide) and by a laboratory chromogenic nitrocefin-based test. isolates from the amoxicillin plates that were absent on the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid plates were identified and tested for beta-lactamase production. based on the non-selective plates, six  of 23 p. intermedia isolates, 2 of 19 b. forsythus isolates and 3 of 23 f. nucleatum isolates were beta-lactamase positive. the beta-lactamase positive species prevotella loescheii, prevotella buccae, prevotella buccalis and actinomyces spp were recovered from the selective amoxicillin plates. beta-lactamase positive subgingival species were recovered from 17 of 23 patients (74%) but usually comprised low proportions of the subgingival microbiota (range  < 0.01-15%). comparison of the dryslide test and the nitrocefin-based laboratory  test revealed full agreement of test results. beta-lactamase activity in whole subgingival plaque was detected in 12 patient samples (52%). it was concluded that beta-lactamase activity in subgingival bacteria in adult periodontitis is a  common feature. however, since the majority of the samples showed only low-level  enzymatic activity, the clinical relevance of this observation with regard to therapy with unprotected enzyme-susceptible beta-lactams is uncertain, though failure on the other hand, is difficult to rule out when a mechanism of resistance is present. the majority of beta-lactamase positive strains was found  among species of the prevotella genus.

TI  == the relationship between gingivitis and the serum antibodies to the microbiota associated with periodontal disease in children with down's syndrome.
AB  == gingival inflammation in down's syndrome children (ds) develops earlier and is more rapid and extensive than in non-ds children. abnormalities in host response  to the oral flora have been proposed as etiological factors of this gingival inflammation. however, the relationship between gingivitis and the host response  to oral microorganisms in ds by age has not been determined. the objective of this study was to clarify this relationship. sera were obtained from 75 ds subjects (aged 2 to 18 years) and their gingival health assessed using a modified pma index (m-pma). antibody titers to porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), treponema denticola (td), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), selenomonas sputigena (sel), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), and streptococcus mitis (mi) were determined using the micro-elisa. ds subjects under 4 years old were found to have significantly more gingival inflammation than did  normal children the same age. a significant positive correlation (r = 0.548, p <  0.0001) existed in the relationship between m-pma score and plaque score for subjects in the g1 age group (deciduous dentition). at g1, the average antibody titers to aa, mi, and fn exceeded those of the normal adult reference serum pool. in addition, igg antibody titers to pg, aa, fn, sel, and mi correlated significantly with the m-pma scores in the g1 age group. there was a correlation  between age (2 to 18 years) and these antibody titers. igg antibody titers to pg, aa, sel, and mi increased significantly with increasing m-pma score. furthermore, the igg antibody titers to pg were higher (p < 0.05) in the most extensive disease group compared to the ds no-disease group. the igg antibody titers to pg  at g3 (early puberty) were significantly higher when compared to g1 (preschool children). the igm antibody titers to aa at g3 were higher (p < 0.05) when compared to g1. this study suggests that colonization by aa and fn are closely associated with the onset of gingival inflammation in ds patients under 5 years old. colonization by pg, aa, sel, and mi in ds appears to be associated with gingivitis at puberty.

TI  == immune response to fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and other anaerobes in children with acute tonsillitis.
AB  == the number of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was determined in the saliva of 20 children with acute group a beta-haemolytic streptococcal (gabhs) pharyngo-tonsillitis, and 20 with acute non-gabhs tonsillitis. antibody titres to four gram-negative anaerobic bacilli that reside in the oropharynx (fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) were determined in these and 20 control patients. an average of 8.8 aerobic and anaerobic isolates per patient saliva specimens were found during the acute tonsillitis stage in both groups, and 6.9 (in gabhs tonsillitis) and 5.6 (in non-gabhs tonsillitis) 5-6 weeks later. there were 10- to 1000-fold more bacteria in the acute stages of the inflammation in both gabhs  and non-gabhs groups. these bacteria were staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, peptostreptococcus spp., f. nucleatum, prevotella spp. and porphyromonas spp. significantly higher antibodies levels to  f. nucleatum and p. intermedia were found in the second serum sample of patients  with non-gabhs pharyngo-tonsillitis (p < 0.001) and gabhs tonsillitis (p < 0.05), as compared with their first sample or the levels of antibodies in controls. the  increase in the number of several aerobic and anaerobic bacteria during acute tonsillitis and the increase in antibody levels to f. nucleatum and p. intermedia, known oral pathogens, may suggest a possible pathogenic role for these organisms in acute non-gabhs and gabhs tonsillitis.

TI  == protein degradation by prevotella intermedia and actinomyces meyeri supports the  growth of non-protein-cleaving oral bacteria in serum.
AB  == the proteolytic activities of oral bacteria are thought to play an important role in the aetiology of dental abscesses. bacteria-derived proteases may contribute to tissue destruction, and are likely to impair host defence by degrading immunoglobulins and complement. degraded periodontal tissue and tissue fluid are  likely to constitute essential sources of nutrients in the abscess. tissue fluid, which is derived from serum, is rich in protein and poor in carbohydrate, suggesting that breakdown of protein and fermentation of amino acids is a crucial step to generate energy for growth of the microflora. the number of oral bacterial species that perform hydrolytic cleavage of protein into polypeptides,  the first step in protein degradation, is relatively small compared to the large  majority of peptidase-producing species. in this study, we therefore investigated the growth-promoting effect of proteinase-producing species like prevotella intermedia and actinomyces meyeri on the growth of some non-proteinase producing  bacteria in mixed cultures. we used serum as a substitute for the supposed natural substrate of the abscess microflora. the breakdown of serum proteins was  investigated using capillary electrophoresis. poor growth was found in mono- and  mixed cultures of non-proteinase producing species eubacterium lentum, fusobacterium nucleatum. peptostreptococcus micros, and streptococcus intermedius. the presence of p. intermedia in mixed cultures strongly enhanced growth of these 4 species, according to the hypothesis that the growth of the mixed cultures was peptide-limited. the enhanced growth of p. intermedia in pronase-digested serum indicated peptide-limited growth of this organism in serum, despite its production of proteinase. we found that growth of monocultures of actinomyces meyeri was poor. in contrast, a. meyeri grew well in mixed cultures and its presence stimulated growth of f. nucleatum and p. micros, suggesting a synergistic relationship. the growth of mono- and mixed cultures was investigated using one representative strain of each species. thus, there is a small risk of having selected unique strains. proteinase inhibitors reduced the growth of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, and p. intermedia in trypticase peptone-yeast extract medium with, and without, igg. our study indicated that proteinase-producing organisms play a key role in mixed cultures of oral bacteria in human serum by providing polypeptides for growth. this may explain their association with dental abscesses.

TI  == development of resistance to metronidazole and minocycline in vitro.
AB  == by local delivery of antibiotics to periodontal pockets, very high initial concentrations are often quickly succeeded by subinhibitory concentrations, which may facilitate development of bacterial resistance. the purpose of the present study was to investigate possible development of resistance in suspected periodontal pathogens after exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of metronidazole and minocycline. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of 18 reference strains and 12 clinical isolates was determined by a broth dilution method. subsequently, all strains with mic < 8 micrograms/ml were exposed to serial passage on plates containing subinhibitory and gradually increasing concentrations of antibiotics, until growth was inhibited. initially, most strains were inhibited at < or = 0.250 microgram/ml of minocycline and < or = 0.5 microgram/ml of metronidazole, though a. actinomycetemcomitans was resistant to metronidazole. after growth at subinhibitory concentrations, 8 strains survived 1-2 x and 11 stains survived 8-32 x their initial mic of metronidazole, growing at up to 8 micrograms/ml. all a. actinomycetemcomitans survived 8-64 x their initial mic of minocycline, growing at > or = 2 micrograms/ml, while all other strains were inhibited at < or = 0.250 microgram/ml, corresponding to a 1-8 x increase in their initial mic. thus, development of resistance was observed for periodontal bacteria growing at up to 64 x their initial mic, but the final level of resistance was moderate.

TI  == secretion of il-1 beta, tnf-alpha, il-8 and il-1ra by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes in response to lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) are the first cells that migrate into periodontal tissues and gingival crevices in response to invading pathogens. it was recently demonstrated that pmn have the ability to synthesize and release cytokines following appropriate stimulation, while it is not clear whether these  capacities are directly related to periodontal destructive processes. we therefore investigated the amounts of the cytokines interleukin-1 beta (il-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-8 and il-1 receptor antagonist (il-1ra) secreted by pmn from healthy donors following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (lps) from 4 periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga ochracea and fusobacterium nucleatum, and the non-oral bacterium escherichia coli. a actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and e. coli lps stimulated the release of significantly greater amounts of il-1 beta, tnf-alpha and il-8 than the control unstimulated pmn (p < 0.01). the levels of il-1 beta, tnf-alpha and il-8 released from cells stimulated with p. gingivalis or c. ochracea lps were significantly lower than those of cells stimulated with a. actinomycetemcomitans or e. coli lps (p < 0.05). on the other hand, substantially greater amounts of il-1ra were released from pmn stimulated with each lps and from control unstimulated pmn during the first 6 h, and then significantly greater amounts of il-1ra were secreted by pmn stimulated with a. actinomycetemcomitans and e.coli lps during the following 12 h (p < 0.01). the inhibitory effects of il-1ra on the biological activity of il-1 in the supernatants of pmn were examined by the thymocyte comitogen proliferation assay. the supernatants of pmn stimulated with each lps showed less biological il-1 activity as compared with the same doses of recombinant human il-1 beta detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. furthermore, no activity was detected in the supernatants of pmn stimulated with  p. gingivalis or c. ochracea lps. these findings demonstrated that lps from periodontopathic bacteria were capable of stimulating pmn to release not only pro-inflammatory cytokines but also their inhibitors such as il-1ra. different secretion levels of these cytokines and their biological activities induced by the various lps might be important in the onset and progression of periodontal diseases.

TI  == bacterial adherence to guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes exposed to the oral environment.
AB  == microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (gtr) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. the purpose of this study  was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). the study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. in each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (p1, p2, m1, m2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). these teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). a 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was  positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with  an external sling suture. with oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of  each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (a. actinomycetemcomitans, a. viscosus, b. melaninogenicus, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, s. mutans, s. sanguis, selenomonas sputigena, t. denticola, and t. vincentii) were present. semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (p < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. these results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.

TI  == evidence for genetic control of changes in f-actin polymerization caused by pathogenic microorganisms: in vitro assessment using gingival fibroblasts from human twins.
AB  == attachment to and migration upon a substratum, as well as other functions of connective tissue cells, are regulated mainly by cytoplasmic structural proteins, particularly filamentous actin (f-actin). pathogenic microorganisms exert negative effects on cytoskeletal proteins. in the present study, normal gingival  fibroblasts from 10 sets of human twins (6 fraternal, dz; 4 identical, mz) were exposed to soluble extracts from porphyromonas gingivalis or fusobacterium nucleatum, then f-actin was stained using fitc-labeled phalloidin. cells were examined under fluorescence, and a computer-assisted image analyzer quantitated f-actin polymerization as fluorescence intensity on a per-cell basis. intraclass  correlation coefficients for f-actin in mz/mz vis-a-vis dz/dz paired cell cultures were determined to assess the possible heritability of responses to the  microorganism preparations. f-actin labeling was significantly different between  control cultures and those exposed to the extracts. both f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis effected f-actin and fibroblast morphology. when the data were adjusted for gender and age effects, and for differences in control f-actin levels, fibroblasts from mz twin pairs were moderately similar in both absolute and relative responses to bacterial challenges; cells from dz twins showed little similarity when response was measured on the absolute scale, and moderate similarity using the relative scale.

TI  == microbial findings of deep peri-implant bone defects.
AB  == the objective of this study was to examine inflammatory tissue in deep peri-implant bone pockets (> 5 mm) for anaerobic bacteria colonization. the peri-implant inflammatory tissue of bone defects from 12 edentulous patients with 18 unsuccessful implants (imz type) was removed after surgical opening of the defects. after grinding the tissue with glass beads in nutrient solution, an aliquot of the suspension was plated and incubated on appropriate culture media.  the quantitative and qualitative distribution of bacteria as a function of the tissue dry weight was determined (cell count/mg dry weight). the mean total cell  count was 67 x 10(3) cells/mg dry weight. the following bacteria dominated: species of the family bacteroidaceae (prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, prevotella oralis, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella denticola); actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; fusobacterium nucleatum; capnocytophaga spp; and eikenella corrodens. bacteroidaceae and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were found particularly frequently. the increased colonization of these bacteria in deep peri-implant bone pockets is consistent with the currently held view of advanced periodontal lesions, whereby certain pathogens grow at a disproportionate rate in comparison with the total bacteria count under specific circumstances.

TI  == the clinical, microbial, and host response characteristics of the failing implant.
AB  == the goal of this study was to provide new data regarding levels of inflammatory and growth factor mediators and bacterial pathogens associated with failing implants, as compared to healthy implants. twenty-one patients with failing implant sites (group 1) and 8 patients with only healthy implants (group 2) were  included. fifteen of the 21 failing implant patients (group 1) also presented with at least one stable nondiseased implant. plaque samples were examined, using dna oligonucleotide probes for 40 different microbes. gingival crevicular fluid samples were collected for the analyses of catabolic bone resorbing agonists prostaglandin e2 (pge2), interleukin-1 beta (il-1 beta) and il-6 and anabolic bone-forming growth factors transforming growth factor beta (tgf-beta) and platelet-derived growth factor (pdgf). although positive trends were noted, there were no significant differences in any of the microbial, inflammatory, or growth  factors mediators comparing failing to stable implants in group 1. this study found greater detection frequencies of p. nigrescens, p. micros, f. nucleatum ss  vincentii, and f. nucleatum ss nucleatum, as well as significant elevations in gcf levels of pge2, il-1 beta, and pdgf in mouths with failing implant sites as compared to mouths with healthy control implants. risk appears to be primarily at a patient level and secondarily at a site or implant level from a clinical, microbial (p. micros and p. nigrescens), and biochemical (pge2 and il-1 beta) perspective. furthermore, the counts of p. nigrescens and p. micros were found to correlate with concentrations of pge2 at a site level.

TI  == rheumatoid factor from periodontitis patients cross-reacts with epitopes on oral  bacteria.
AB  == objectives: the objective of this study was to determine the antigenic specificity of rheumatoid factor (rf) that had previously been reported in the serum of patients with periodontitis. design: igm-rf was isolated from the serum  of five rf-seropositive rheumatoid arthritis patients and 14 rf-seropositive periodontitis and examined for specificity to human igg and selected oral bacteria. methods: igm-rf was prepared by affinity chromatography on human igg columns. human igg antibody to capnocytophaga gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was isolated by binding and elution of antibody from the bacteria, followed by purification using a rabbit anti-igg affinity column. main outcome measure: binding of the isolated igm-rf was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the antigens used for detection of binding included isolated human igg, human igg antibody bound to the bacteria, and the bacteria alone. inhibition of the igm-rf binding with igg or fc gamma was used to assess the specificity of the reactivity with igg and/or the bacteria. results: the results showed that the igm-rf reacted with polyclonal human igg nonspecifically bound to microtiter plates. the reactivity of the igm-rf was increased when incubated with igg that bound as antibody to c.  gingivalis, f. nucleatum or a. actinomycetemcomitans. however, the igm-rf did not bind with increased intensity to the specific igg antibody preparations or to igg preparations lacking antibody to these micro-organisms. additionally, the igm-rf  preparations bound to surface components of both c. gingivalis and f. nucleatum.  blocking studies showed that fc gamma but not igg inhibited igm-rf binding to both micro-organisms. conclusions: these findings indicate that the rf detected in the serum of some periodontitis patients may be elicited by certain micro-organisms in the subgingival plaque. furthermore, c. gingivalis and f. nucleatum appear to express surface antigen epitopes that are antigenically related to determinants on igg can induce cross-reactive igm-rf.

TI  == the influence of periodontitis on the subgingival flora around implants in partially edentulous patients.
AB  == the hypothesis that teeth act as reservoirs of micro-organisms for the colonization of oral implants has recently been stated several times. the present study aimed at examining, in partially edentulous patients with severe periodontitis, whether pockets around teeth and implants harbored a comparable micro-flora. in 6 patients (3 with refractory periodontitis and 3 with advanced chronic adult periodontitis), plaque samples were taken from a deep and shallow pocket around both teeth and implants for differential phase contrast microscopy  and dna probe analysis. the results showed important differences in the sub-gingival flora between the 2 disease groups, as well as between deep and shallow pockets, around both implants and teeth. on the other hand, when pockets  around teeth and implants with equal depths were compared a striking similarity was observed in the microbial composition. these observations confirm the hypothesis that pockets around teeth act as a reservoir and highlight the importance of periodontal health when oral implants are planned.

TI  == degradation of lactoferrin by periodontitis-associated bacteria.
AB  == the degradation of human lactoferrin by putative periodontopathogenic bacteria was examined. fragments of lactoferrin were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and measured by densitometry. the degradation of lactoferrin was more extensive by porphyromonas gingivalis and capnocytophaga sputigena, slow by capnocytophaga ochracea, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia, and very slow or absent by prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter sputorum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and peptostreptococcus micros. all strains of p. gingivalis tested degraded lactoferrin. the degradation was sensitive to protease inhibitors, cystatin c and albumin. the degradation by c. sputigena was not affected by the protease inhibitors and the detected lactoferrin fragments exhibited electrophoretic mobilities similar to those ascribed to deglycosylated forms of lactoferrin. furthermore a weak or absent reactivity of these fragments with sialic acid-specific lectin suggested that they are desialylated. the present data indicate that certain bacteria colonizing the periodontal pocket can degrade lactoferrin. the presence of other human proteins as specific inhibitors and/or as substrate competitors may counteract this degradation process.

TI  == the adherence of periodontopathogens to periodontal probes. a possible factor in  intra-oral transmission?
AB  == periodontal probes have previously been shown to harbor several bacterial types or species after probing periodontally diseased pockets. this study aims to identify and quantify periodontopathogens that may adhere to a periodontal probe  by culturing techniques. it also examines the probe's roughness on its capability to collect bacteria, comparing merrit-b probes (with deep indentations) with tps  probes (with smooth surfaces). from the differential phase contrast microscopy findings it was seen that, while paper-points harbored nearly 50% motile rods or  spirochetes, the periodontal probes were just at, or below, the 20% threshold level for pathogenicity (23.6% for the merrit-b probe and 11.3% for the tps probe). the cultural data showed that paper-points had significantly higher (p <  0.05) numbers of anaerobic bacteria than the 2 probe types, which still harbored  up to 10(7) cfu. no significant differences could be detected between the probes. when specific periodontopathic species were considered, it was seen that for all  species, even for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or porphyromonas gingivalis, the detection frequency was comparable for the 3 sampling devices. however, the levels of prevotella intermedia and campylobacter rectus was significantly higher in samples from paper-points (p < 0.05), but still their numbers reached even 10(5) on the probes. differences among the 2 probe types were again negligible. periodontal probes harbor relatively high numbers of bacteria found in periodontal pockets and may be able to carry them over to other sites. further studies are needed to determine if, and to what extent, transmission occurs during periodontal probing.

TI  == effect of oral bacteria on peripheral blood leukocyte interleukin-6 and soluble interleukin-6 receptor production.
AB  == to determine the effect of pathogenic oral bacteria on interleukin 6 (il-6) and soluble il-6 receptor production, we measured their release by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro. unseparated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, peripheral blood lymphocytes (monocyte depleted), pure t cells, or monocytes were cultured with actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, fusobacterium nucleatum or porphyromonas gingivalis for  24 h. supernatants were tested for il-6 and soluble il-6 receptor by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. only monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells responded with significant il-6 release in the presence of all  bacteria tested. however, peripheral blood lymphocytes were capable of producing  il-6 when activated by phytohemagglutinin or il-2 followed by bacteria, though substantially less than cultures containing monocytes. no bacteria tested increased soluble il-6 receptor release over spontaneous soluble il-6 receptor release. we conclude that monocytes release il-6 after contact with oral pathogens; however, soluble il-6 receptor from t cells and monocytes is constitutively produced and may modulate il-6 actions.

AB  == the aim of the present study was to analyze the cytotoxicity of some bacterial species associated with periodontal diseases. the specificity of cytotoxicity was estimated against cells of various origin and from different individuals. the reference bacteria were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum. these bacteria were cultured for 24 h in  liquid media and the supernatants were used in cytotoxicity assays. the target cells used were human gingival fibroblasts (gf), dermal fibroblasts (k4), gingival epithelial cells (e) and hela-cells (hela). these cells were exposed at  4 h or 24 h, respectively, to various concentrations of culture supernatants from the selected bacteria. the influence on the viability and metabolism of the cells were estimated quantitatively as increase in neutral red uptake and lactic acid production. growth medium supernatants of p. gingivalis 33277 were strongly cytotoxic to gingival fibroblasts after 24 h incubation, compared to supernatants of p. gingivalis 381 or w 50, a. actinomycetemcomitans or f. nucleatum cultures.  the toxic effect of p. gingivalis 33277 decreased drastically after heat inactivation, which indicates effects of proteins. by adding anti-sera the cytotoxicity of p. gingivalis 33277 could be dose dependently neutralized, which  was not the case when supernatants of a. actino-mycetemcomitans was tested. target cells of epithelial origin did not show increased cytotoxicity to p. gingivalis 33277. the results of the present study strengthen the hypothesis that p. gingivalis remains as a suspect causative key component in periodontal diseases.

TI  == effects of sublethal exposure to an antiseptic mouthrinse on representative plaque bacteria.
AB  == although the mechanism responsible for the clinical antiplaque efficacy of oral antiseptics is generally considered to be primarily one of bactericidal activity, it has been suggested that oral antiseptics may have additional effects on bacteria exposed to sublethal levels. studies reported herein, investigated the effects of sublethal levels of an essential oil-containing antiseptic mouthrinse  (listerine antiseptic, warner-lambert co., morris plains, nj) on selected activities of representative plaque microorganisms using in vitro models. these studies demonstrated that sublethal exposure to the tested oral antiseptic can have significant effects in reducing intergeneric coaggregation, increasing bacterial generation time, and extracting endotoxin from gram-negative bacteria.  these in vitro activities can be correlated with features of plaque formation and pathogenicity seen in vivo; however, additional studies will be necessary to confirm that these mechanisms are, in fact, operative clinically.

TI  == anaerobic microorganisms in root canals of human teeth with chronic apical periodontitis detected by indirect immunofluorescence.
AB  == aiming to assess the presence of selected anaerobic microorganisms in root canals of human teeth with chronic apical periodontitis. 25 central and lateral upper incisors presenting with radiographic evidence of chronic apical periodontitis were studied. the pulp chamber was opened under aseptic conditions and samples of the root canal content were collected with sterile absorbent paper points, which  were placed and dispersed in test tubes containing reduced transport medium rtt.  aliquots were dried on glass slides and stained by indirect immunofluorescence for detection of actinomyces viscosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. the results showed a positive indirect immunofluorescence reaction in 24 of the 25 samples. fourteen were positive for the specie actinomyces viscosus, 12 for prevotella intermedia, 10 for fusobacterium nucleatum and 4 for porphyromonas gingivalis. a semiquantitative assay was easily implemented for assessment of degree of infection by the organisms in individual cases.

TI  == proteolytic artifacts in sds-page analysis of selected periodontal pathogens.
AB  == the aim of the study was to examine whether proteolytic artifacts, which result in a loss and poor resolution of protein bands, occur during sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of cellular proteins from selected proteolytic (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola) and non-proteolytic (fusobacterium nucleatum) bacteria. conditions to limit or prevent proteolysis were also investigated. bacterial cells were incubated in solubilizing buffer (sds+ beta mercaptoethanol) at room temperature for various periods of time before boiling. a control assay consisted of trichloroacetic acid-treated bacterial cells. cellular proteins were separated by electrophoresis and stained with coomassie blue. proteolysis occurred very rapidly in the case of p. gingivalis (< 30 s), whereas a longer incubation time (> 1 h) was required to observe similar effects in p. nigrescens and t. denticola. no proteolysis was observed for f. nucleatum. in all cases, heat (100  degrees c) and low ph (< 4) treatments of bacterial cells could avoid production  of proteolytic artifacts. incorporation of specific protease inhibitors before solubilization of bacteria could also prevent proteolysis. more particularly, n-alpha-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (tlck), iodoacetamide and diisopropylfluorophosphate (50 mm) were highly efficient for p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens and t. denticola, respectively. when outer membranes of p. gingivalis  were prepared in the presence of tlck, numerous additional protein brands, not seen in the absence of tlck, were detected. the present study suggests that specific protease inhibitors, effective in preventing proteolysis, should be identified and added during cell fractionation and protein purification procedures.

TI  == degradation of host protease inhibitors and activation of plasminogen by proteolytic enzymes from porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola.
AB  == bacterial proteases may participate in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases through their action on host proteins. in the present study, the ability of selected periodontopathogens, as well as two proteases isolated from porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola, to degrade host protease inhibitors was evaluated. the activation of human plasminogen by the two bacterial proteases was also investigated. proteolytic breakdown of host protease inhibitors (alpha-1-antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, antithrombin iii, antiplasmin and cystatin c) was evaluated by sds-page. the 80 kda trypsin-like protease of p. gingivalis completely digested the six protease inhibitors under investigation, whereas the 95 kda chymotrypsin-like protease of  t. denticola was slightly less active, more particularly on alpha 2-macroglobulin and cystatin c. when whole cells from a number of oral bacterial species were tested, the most significant degradation was obtained with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and capnocytophaga spp. peptostreptococcus micros and propionibacterium acnes had only some degradative activity on selected inhibitors, whereas three bacterial species, actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus and fusobacterium nucleatum, had no  effect on the protease inhibitors. the 80 kda protease of p. gingivalis demonstrated strong plasminogen activation, whereas no such activity was associated with the 95 kda protease of t. denticola. this study indicates the high potential of some periodontal pathogens to destroy protease inhibitors and activate plasminogen. this may result in an uncontrolled degradation of periodontal tissues and a rapid progression of the disease.

TI  == the effect of age on the development of gingivitis. clinical, microbiological and histological findings.
AB  == in the present "experimental gingivitis" study, the response of the marginal gingiva to plaque formation was studied in one group of young subjects, 20-25 years of age, and in one group of older subjects, aged 65-80 years. during a 4-week period, all subjects received a series of professional tooth cleaning to establish healthy gingival conditions. a baseline examination (day 0) included assessments of plaque and gingivitis. sites that were examined (the experimental  sites) included the mesio-palatal, palatal, and disto-palatal surfaces of all teeth present in the 15 ... 25 tooth region. among the experimental sites, microbial sampling and gingival fluid assessment were performed and one gingival  biopsy harvested from each subject. following the baseline examination, the participants abolished mechanical tooth cleaning measures in the palatal and approximal surfaces of 15 ... 25. the clinical examination and the gingival fluid measurement were repeated on days 7, 14 and 21 of no oral hygiene. the microbiological sampling and the biopsy procedure were repeated on days 7 and 21. the data collected demonstrated that old subjects, during a 3-week period of oral hygiene abstention, formed similar amounts of plaque as the young subjects, but developed more gingivitis than young subjects. thus, the clinical gingivitis assessments, the gingival fluid measurements and morphometric determinations made in the biopsy samples documented that the gingival lesion which formed in the old individuals was more pronounced and contained more inflammatory cells than the corresponding lesion in the young subject sample.

TI  == histological and microbiological aspects of ligature-induced periodontitis in beagle dogs.
AB  == this study was designed to investigate, using 6 beagle dogs, the levels of selected putative pathogens in healthy sites, in gingivitis sites, and in sites with histologically confirmed attachment loss. levels of attachment loss increased with increasing periods of ligation and reached a maximum of 0.15 mm at 57 days. both histological attachment level and histological pocket depth were found to vary significantly with health/disease status (p < 0.0001). higher numbers of total colony-forming units were seen for ligated sites than for healthy and gingivitis sites. levels of porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia also changed significantly with health/disease status (p < 0.001). these organisms showed their greatest increases at the time of the most intense attachment loss. higher levels of fusobacterium nucleatum were seen in the gingivitis sites than in healthy or ligated sites. low levels of campylobacter rectus and capnocytophaga spp. were detected throughout. the morphometric microbiological analysis revealed unexpectedly high %s of motile rods, while spirochetes were found in very low %s. the total number of bacterial cells detected using phase contrast microscopy was not found to vary significantly. none of the morphotypes were demonstrated as showing significant changes with health/disease status.

TI  == associations of endodontic symptoms and signs with particular combinations of specific bacteria.
AB  == significant associations have been reported between (a) specific bacterial species isolated from root canals and (b) between individual bacterial species and endodontic symptoms and signs. the prime objective of this study was to determine whether particular combinations of specific bacteria are associated with individual endodontic symptoms and signs. seventy root canals were investigated microbiologically taking care to maintain the viability of obligate  anaerobes, which accounted for 64% of the total species isolated, including peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella oralis, eubacterium aerofaciens, eubacterium lentum, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella  buccae and prevotella intermedia. significant associations were found between individual clinical features and the following pairs of species: (a) pain (37 cases) and peptostreptococcus spp./prevotella spp., peptostreptococcus spp./prevotella melaninogenica, pstr. micros/prev. melaninogenica (all p < 0.01); (b) swelling (23 cases) and pstr. micros/prevotella spp. (p < 0.01); (c) 'wet' canal (57 cases) and prevotella spp./eubacterium spp. (p < 0.01), peptostreptococcus spp./eubacterium spp. (p < 0.05). thus data from this investigation suggests that statistically significant associations exist between  individual endodontic symptoms and signs and particular combinations of specific  bacteria.

TI  == microbiological and serological investigations of oral lesions in papillon-lefevre syndrome.
AB  == microbiological and serological (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) investigations were carried out, including karyotyping, on two asian children with papillon-lefevre syndrome. in case 1, a girl aged four years, the most prevalent putative periodontopathogens were eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia (deciduous dentition)  and bacteroides gracilis, e corrodens and f nucleatum (permanent dentition). in case 2, a boy aged nine years, they were f nucleatum, p intermedia and p loeschii and e corrodens. serum from case 2 showed a raised specific igg antibody response to actinomyces actino-mycetemcomitans serotype b. thus, a wider range of species  than hitherto reported may be associated with papillon-lefevre syndrome, including a actino-mycetemcomitans and f nucleatum.

TI  == prevalence of 6 putative periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque samples from romanian adult periodontitis patients.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to determine by standard cultivation procedures  the detection frequencies of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, and capnocytophaga species as well as various enteric rods in subgingival plaque samples form romanian adult periodontitis patients. dna probe  analysis (affirm dp microbial identification test) was also used, parallel to cultivation, to identify p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and b. forsythus, in deep (> or = 6 mm) and intermediate (4-5 mm) pockets in some of the subjects investigated. paper points were used to sample 86 deep pockets in 36 patients and 27 intermediate pockets in 9 of the 36 patients. the chi 2 test was  used to test for significance of differences between results obtained by cultivation and dna analysis in both intermediate and deep pockets. p. gingivalis was recovered in a high percentage of the patients (75.8%) and sites (63.6%) examined, followed by p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, and a. actinomycetemcomitans,  respectively. capnocytophaga species were present in almost all subjects. enteric rods were recovered in 61.1% of the patients and 55.8% of the sites. except for this high prevalence of enteric rods, the present group of patients had the periodontal species monitored in %s similar to those commonly perceived in the west. the affirm dp test and cultivation showed poor correlation in detecting p.  gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and b. forsythus. the cultivation prevalence of p. gingivalis and p. intermedia in deep pockets was similar to their prevalence in intermediate ones. overall, the prevalence of the periodontal pathogens investigated in the present romanian periodontitis patients is similar  to what has been revealed in matching norwegian and other western periodontitis patient populations. the high prevalence of enteric rods in the romanian patients may have been an artifact resulting from prolonged transport of the samples in vmga iii.

TI  == immune response to fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia in patients  with infectious mononucleosis.
AB  == the role of four oral flora organisms (fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) was investigated in 22 patients with infectious mononucleosis. immunoglobulin-g class antibody titres to these organisms were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. serum levels in the patients were determined at day 1 and 42-56 days later. significantly higher antibody levels to f. nucleatum and pr. intermedia were found in the second serum sample of patients as compared to their first sample. the elevated antibody levels to f. nucleatum and pr. intermedia, known oral pathogens, suggest a potential pathogenic role for these organisms in  the pharyngo-tonsillitis associated with infectious mononucleosis.

TI  == viability of four putative periodontal pathogens and enteric rods in the anaerobic transport medium vmga iii.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the survival in vmga iii of porphyromonas  gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and enteric rods in laboratory cultures as well as in subgingival plaque samples. laboratory strains of the 4 putative periodontal pathogens and escherichia coli were used in the laboratory part of this study. also, 31 subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 22 periodontal patients and stored in vmga iii. each sample, from both the laboratory and the clinical parts, was divided into 3 portions. one portion was cultured within a few hours of collection (baseline), while the second was processed after 24 h (day 2) and the third 48 h later (day 3). the results of the clinical part indicate that the  detection frequencies of all 4 periodontal pathogens and their levels in positive samples decreased, to different degrees, by day 2 and decreased further by day 3. enteric rods were not detected in base line samples. however, they were present in 16.1% and 22.6% of day 2 and day 3 samples, respectively. similarly, the laboratory results demonstrate a significant decrease in the levels of the 4 periodontal pathogens tested by day 2 and day 3, whereas the opposite occurred for e. coli. p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and f. nucleatum survived better in the presence of e. coli than alone, whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans survived less well when co-inoculated with e. coli. vmga iii appears to maintain microbial population ratios for periods up to 24 h. after 24 h, the multiplication of enteric organisms may alter the original proportions of the sample.

TI  == cell envelope and cell wall immunization of macaca fascicularis: effect on the progression of ligature-induced periodontitis.
AB  == the nonhuman primate, macaca fascicularis, was used to study the role of immunization with selected members of the periodontopathic microbiota in the longitudinal progression of ligature-induced periodontitis. animals were immunized with cell envelope antigens prepared from porphyromonas gingivalis and  prevotella intermedia, and a mixture prepared from fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, and actinomyces viscosus. serum immunoglobulin g (igg), igm and iga isotype antibodies increased significantly in all immunization groups and were specific for each of the immunogens. p. gingivalis and p. intermedia immunization resulted in a stabilization of the proportions of these species throughout most of the experiment. the high p. gingivalis antibody titer resulted in low p. gingivalis numbers being recovered. p. gingivalis immunization, while lowering recoverable viable p. gingivalis, resulted in significantly increased levels of prevotella loescheii, prevotella buccae, bacteroides macacae and prevotella melaninogenica compared with preligation and preimmunization levels. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp. and eikenella spp. remained at preligation levels postimmunization. campylobacter spp. increased significantly during the course of the experiment in all groups, whereas the levels of fusobacterium spp. decreased. plaque indices and bleeding on probing showed significant increases in all groups following ligation, with the placebo group showing the greatest increase. pocket depth measurements revealed that , whereas the placebo animals showed an approximate 5% increase, the p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups showed nearly a 20% increase in pocket depth.  attachment level measurements showed significantly greater attachment loss in the p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups, and the f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus immunization appeared to prevent significant changes in pocket depth/attachment level loss. radiographic measurement of bone loss by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis revealed that the placebo group lost bone throughout the experiment. p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups showed an exacerbated loss of bone density and the group immunized with f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus exhibited significantly lower amounts of bone loss when analyzed by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis, compared with the other immunized groups. although immunization with p. gingivalis and p.  intermedia cell envelope antigens had an effect on their emergence in the complex microbiota of the developing periodontal pocket, this immunization also resulted  in greater bone loss than immunization with f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus, suggesting that, whereas selective members of the putative periodontopathic microbiota may play a direct role in periodontal tissue destruction, the complexity of the subgingival microbiota dictates that considerable scrutiny is required to select useful immunogens that can elicit functional protection from periodontal tissue destruction induced by oral microorganisms that already colonize or infect the host.

TI  == competition for peptides and amino acids among periodontal bacteria.
AB  == we recently studied the utilization of glutathione (l-gamma-glutamyl-l-cysteinylglycine), l-cysteinylglycine and l-cysteine by anaerobic bacteria. the rate of hydrogen sulfide formation from these compounds was determined and it was concluded that peptostreptococcus micros and fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum had an active transport of small peptides. in the present study it is shown that methyl mercaptan formation from l-methionine and l-methionyl-containing peptides can also be used to study peptide utilization. there were differences among the periodontal bacteria p. micros, f. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis in their capacity to use l-cysteine and l-methionine and peptides containing these amino acids. the peptides were used more efficiently by p. micros and f. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum than by p. gingivalis. all three species used the peptides more  efficiently than the free amino acids. the efficiency in utilizing various amino  acids and peptides may be among the key determinants of the periodontal microbial ecology.

TI  == endodontic pathogens: propagation of infection through patent dentinal tubules in traumatized monkey teeth.
AB  == periapical pathology indicating endodontic infection, when present in marginal periodontitis-affected teeth, has recently been shown to be an aggravating factor in progression of marginal destruction. this has been associated with patency of  dentinal tubules in the tooth cervix, an area normally devoid of cementum following periodontal therapy. these studies are, however hampered by that only circumstantial evidence such as presence of periapical destruction have been applied as criteria of endodontic infection. the purpose of the present investigation was to study to what extent a predefined selection of endodontic pathogens inoculated in the root canal can influence periodontal pathology and healing in areas of the root covered by or devoid of cementum, using root resorption as a histomorphometric marker. exposed dentine surfaces, in the present study showed significantly larger areas of resorption in infected roots compared to non-infected roots, while cementum surfaces showed an almost identical distribution of tissue reactions regardless of root canal infection or  not. it was concluded that endodontic pathogens or their products were not able to penetrate the cementum barrier. the significantly larger areas of resorption on exposed dentine surfaces in infected roots compared to non-infected roots indicated that endodontic pathogens or their products could spread through dentinal tubules to a root surface void of cementum. extrapolated to the marginal situation this indicated that endodontic pathogens in the root canal might be able to aggravate marginal infection in areas of root devoid of cementum.

TI  == comparative virulence of periodontopathogens in a mouse abscess model.
AB  == objective(s): this report compares the virulence of selected strains of p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, f. nucleatum and t. denticola in a murine model as a measure of pathogenic potential of these oral microorganisms. the characteristics of the tissue destruction associated with these monoinfections were then related to a potential model for bacterial synergism in  progressing periodontitis. design and methods: all bacterial strains were grown to mid-logarithmic to early stationary growth phase, harvested and used at various doses to challenge balb/c normal and balb/c dexamethasone (dex) treated mice to mimic a neutrophil dysfunction. the characteristics of tissue destruction, and overt tissue destructive capacity of these species were examined as a function of challenge dose and time. outcome measures: the mice were examined for an interval of approximately 15 days post-challenge and the presence/absence of lesions, localized or generalized nature of the lesion (including size in mm2), and lethality of the infection were assessed. results: comparison of the virulence of the various p. gingivalis strains related to lethality and lesion size associated with destruction of the connective tissue, indicated a virulence capacity of p. gingivalis strains 53977>w50 = t22>3079>33277>381. c. rectus elicited localized necrotic lesions which were limited to the epithelial layers of the skin. the size of the lesions also indicated a graded difference in virulence, such that c. rectus strains 234>576>>33238. a. actinomycetemcomitans caused the formation of classic localized abscesses with a pmn infiltrate and inflammatory exudates. although each of the a. actinomycetemcomitans strains exhibited a similar virulence pattern in this murine model, a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b representative  strains were potentially more pathogenic with a virulence capacity of 3113d-n = 3975a>jp2 > or = y4>29523>33384. both c. rectus and a. actinomycetemcomitans strains showed clear evidence that recent clinical isolates were more virulent than laboratory strains. challenge with f. nucleatum resulted in tissue destructive responses which were different from those observed with the other strains used in this study. a rapid onset of dose-dependent lesion development, related to the formation of either closed abscesses or open lesions, was observed with f. nucleatum. tissue involvement was also greater at lower f. nucleatum doses when compared to the other bacteria. f. nucleatum challenge of dex-treated  mice resulted in a shift to open lesions. t. denticola appeared to be more tissue invasive than the other species examined in this study. challenge of mice with t. denticola resulted in involvement of multiple tissues, including epithelial and connective tissues, as well as appearing to invade muscle layers and deeper tissues. in addition to invading deeper tissues, the resulting lesions took considerably longer to resolve. in the dex-treated mice (neutrophil depleted), p. gingivalis, c. rectus, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were significantly more virulent. in contrast, while dex treatment altered the characteristics of lesions caused by f. nucleatum, the extent of lesions produced by f. nucleatum and t. denticola was not substantially enhanced. conclusions: the results obtained from  this study suggest that different microorganisms have the ability to provide individual pathologies which may act in an additive/synergistic fashion contributing to the tissue destruction noted in periodontitis.

TI  == cellular source, activation and inhibition of dental plaque collagenase.
AB  == dental plaque is the major aetiological factor in periodontal diseases and contains several proteolytic enzymes. the origin of these proteinases is, however, poorly studied. this study was undertaken to characterize collagenase present in dental plaque of adult periodontitis patients. vertebrate-type rather  than bacterial-derived collagenase activity was detected in extracts of both supra- and subgingival dental plaque extracts of adult periodontitis patients. dental plaque collagenase was found to exist predominantly in autoactive form. dental plaque collagenase from periodontally healthy individuals existed in latent from. latent dental plaque collagenase from periodontitis lesions could be activated by a 95 kd chymotrypsin-like proteinase from treponema denticola and human leukocyte cathepsin g but not by human plasmin. incubation of purified latent leukocyte collagenase with whole cells of fusobacterium nucleatum, eubacterium saburreum, prevotella buccae and porphyromonas gingivalis, however, did not result to the activation of the enzyme. doxycycline in vitro inhibited dental plaque collagenase with an ic50-value of 20 microm. dental plaque collagenase degraded more efficiently type i and ii collagens than type iii collagen. western-blot analysis with specific anti-human neutrophil collagenase-antibody revealed that both in supra- and subgingival dental plaque extracts dental plaque collagenase had undergone proteolytic conversion from an 80 kd proform to a 58 kd active form which is associated with catalytic autoactivity as measured by functional collagenase assay. this reflects proteolytic activation of leukocyte collagenase in dental plaque probably by other proteases derived from potent periodontopathogenic bacteria such as t. denticola or other pmn proteases such as cathepsin g.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == endodontic pathogens in periodontal disease augmentation.
AB  == periapical pathology indicating endodontic infection, when present in periodontitis-affected teeth, has recently been shown to be correlated to marginal periodontal breakdown. this has been associated with patency of dentinal tubules in the tooth cervix, an area normally devoid of cementum following periodontal therapy. these studies are, however hampered by that only circumstantial evidence such as presence of periapical destruction have been applied as criteria of endodontic infection. the aim of the present investigation was to assess the effects of endodontic pathogens on marginal periodontal wound healing on root surfaces devoid of cementum but surrounded by healthy periodontal membrane. significant differences between infected and non-infected teeth were found with respect to pathological pocket and connective tissue: the experimental defects were covered by approximately 20% more pocket epithelium in infected teeth while defects in non-infected teeth showed approximately 10% more connective tissue coverage. it was concluded, that an intra-canal infection of endodontic pathogens stimulates epithelial downgrowth along denuded dentin surfaces with marginal communication. extrapolated to the clinical situation, endodontic infections in periodontitis-prone patients may augment periodontitis propagation.

AB  == earlier work has shown that gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) contains dipeptidyl peptidase (dpp) activities that resemble those in host tissue. here, further comparisons were made with enzymes from suspected periodontal pathogens. gingival tissue and gcf were collected from patients with chronic periodontitis. dpp ii and dpp iv fractions with acid and alkaline ph optima, respectively, were separated from crude tissue extracts by gel-filtration chromatography. bacterial  cell sonicates were prepared from broth cultures of reference strains. there was  moderate to strong dpp activity with capnocytophaga spp., porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella spp., very weak activity with treponema denticola and no detectable activity with actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or fusobacterium nucleatum. banding patterns in gcf, tissue and bacterial samples were compared on substrate-impregnated overlay membranes applied to isoelectric focusing gels. in  gels washed with acid buffer, gcf had bands corresponding to tissue dpp ii. use of an alkaline washing buffer showed gcf activity which closely matched tissue dpp iv that had been pretreated with neuraminidase, an enzyme found by others in  the gingival crevice. p. gingivalis gave multiple bands and several of these had  counterparts in gcf. the apparent presence in gcf of the dpp from p. gingivalis is consistent with the association of this organism with destructive periodontitis.

AB  == expression of the interleukin-2 receptor (il-2r) on t cells is the molecular mechanism that initiates the g0 to g1 transition and is the critical first step for t cell proliferation in response to antigen. the effect of whole periodontal  bacteria and lipopolysaccharides (lps) on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) il-2r expression was examined in vitro. lps induced a modest but significant increase in high affinity il-2r alpha/beta (p55/p75 positive) expression on pbmc over untreated cells after 48 h culture. addition of lps to pbmc cultures depleted of monocytes had no effect on il-2r expression compared to untreated cultures. interleukin-1 (il-1) caused a similar effect to lps in 48 h pbmc cultures but il-1 also increased high affinity il-2r expression in cultures  depleted of adherent mononuclear cells. when antibody to il-1 was simultaneously  added with lps to pbmc cultures, the high affinity il-2r inductive effect was reversed at 48 h, suggesting that the lps effect on pbmc il-2r was indirect, via  monocytes. whole pathogenic oral bacteria cultured with pbmc at high (100:1), but not low (10:1) bacteria:pbmc ratios had a similar effect to lps, inducing high affinity il-2r expression at 48 h. increases in soluble il-2r alpha were also measured in supernatants of pbmc incubated with periodontal bacteria compared to  untreated controls. in this system, a critical threshold of bacteria was required to activate pbmc perhaps related to the quantity of cell-surface lps presented to adherent mononuclear cells.

TI  == a 6-month home-usage trial of 0.1% and 0.2% delmopinol mouthwashes (ii). effects  on the plaque microflora.
AB  == the effects of 0.1% and 0.2% delmopinol mouthwashes on supragingival plaque flora were investigated in a 6-month home-use study. 141 subjects were studied from whom plaque was collected at baseline, 12, 24, and 36 weeks. overall, there were  no consistent effects on microscopic or total counts. however, there was a significant reduction in the proportion of dextran-producing streptococci in the  active groups compared to the control group throughout treatment. there was no colonisation by candida or gram-negative aerobic bacilli in the active groups nor was there any decrease in susceptibility to delmopinol. delmopinol appears to mediate its anti-plaque effect without causing a major shift in bacterial populations, although dextran-producing bacteria appear to be affected, which may have relevance to this agent's mode of action.

TI  == bacteremia in conjunction with endodontic therapy.
AB  == this study characterizes oral microorganisms believed to have spread from the root canal into the blood stream during and after endodontic therapy of teeth with asymptomatic apical periodontitis. microbiological samples were taken under  aseptic conditions from the root canal of 26 single-rooted teeth in 26 patients.  in the endodontic treatment of 13 of the patients (group 1), the first 3 reamers, sizes 15, 20 and 25, were used to a level 2 mm beyond the apical foramen. in the  other 13 patients (group 2), the instrumentation ended inside the root canal 1 mm short of the apical foramen. blood samples were taken from the patients during the instrumentation and 10 min after the treatment was completed. anaerobic microorganisms were isolated from all root canals. in 7 patients of group 1, propionibacterium acnes, peptostreptococcus prevotii, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and saccharomyces cerevisiae were recovered from the blood. in 4 patients of group 2, p. intermedia, actinomyces israelii, streptococcus intermedius and streptococcus sanguis were isolated from the blood. biochemical tests and antibiograms revealed that the isolates from the root canal and blood had identical profiles within the patients, strongly suggesting that the microorganisms isolated from the blood had the root canal as their source.

TI  == molecular and immunological characterization of a 64-kda protein of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == the 64-kda protein to which about half the sera from patients with localized juvenile periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis reacted strongly was purified from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4. determination of the n-terminal sequence of the protein revealed that it was a groel-like protein. the dna fragment containing the groel gene of a. actinomycetemcomitans was amplified  by polymerase chain reaction, and the groesl operon was cloned by using colony hybridization with the amplified fragment from a. actinomycetemcomitans chromosomal dna. sequence analysis revealed that structures of the operon and its products were typical in gram-negative bacteria. rabbit polyclonal antibodies to  the 64-kda protein cross-reacted with approximately 65-kda proteins of haemophilus aphrophilus, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus paraphrophilus, escherichia coli and eikenella corrodens but not with any cellular proteins of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. it is possible that antibodies reactive to the 64-kda protein in periodontitis patients are induced by the cross-reactivity with the hsp60 proteins of other bacteria.

TI  == cellular adhesion molecules on periodontal lymphocytes.
AB  == t cell induced differentiation of b cells has been shown to be dependent on the cd2/lfa-3 and lfa-1/icam-1 pathways. flow cytometric analysis was used to examine these adhesion molecules on t and b cells extracted from gingival tissues before  and after stimulation with the putative periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas  gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum. adhesion molecule expression on peripheral blood cells from healthy adults was used as a control. approximately 50 per cent of b cells extracted from gingival tissues expressed lfa-3 and icam-1 compared with 30 per cent positive peripheral blood b cells. around 50 per cent of gingival t cells expressed cd2 relative to 76 per cent positive peripheral blood t cells. however, 40-50 per cent of both gingival and peripheral blood t cells expressed lfa-1. there was no difference in the expression of adhesion molecules on t and b cells extracted from health/marginal gingivitis or adult periodontitis lesions. after stimulation of gingival cells in vitro, the per cent cd2 positive t cells and lfa-3 and icam-1 positive b cells remained relatively stable over the six-day culture period, although p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum appeared to induce an increase in the percentage of gingival t cells expressing lfa-1. in contrast to the gingival lymphocytes, stimulation of peripheral blood cells resulted in an increase in the per cent cd2 positive t cells, lfa-3 and icam-1 positive b cells, with a decrease in lfa-1 positive t cells. the results therefore demonstrated that gingival t and b cells express adhesion molecules in  vivo.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == succession of putative peri-implant pathogens after root-form and plate-form implant placement in partially dentate adult monkeys.
AB  == this report describes the succession of putative peri-implant pathogens in partially dentate monkeys after dental implantation and prosthetic reconstruction. tooth and implant (6 root-end form, 4 blade-vent implants) sites  in eight monkeys were monitored microbiologically and clinically during the pre-implant stage, abutment connection stage, bridge placement stage, and three and six months after the bridge placement stage. tooth and implant sites were cleaned monthly post-extraction. microbiological studies included dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and primary phenotypic characterization of culture isolates. after implant surgery, the median proportion of several putative peri-implant pathogens studied were significantly  elevated. following fixture placement, p. intermedia replaced p. melaninogenica as the predominant black pigmented anaerobic bacilli (bpab) in the mouth. after abutment connection stage, levels of p. intermedia, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f.  nucleatun, haemophilus sp. and spirochetes were significantly elevated at implant and tooth sites. three months after bridge installations, p. intermedia and a. actinomycetemcomitans remained significantly elevated at implant sites. at six months after bridge installation, levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans declined significantly relative to levels at three months.  porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes were not significantly elevated although their  levels correlated with gingival redness. p. intermedia, porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes levels correlated significantly with probing depth. correlation was detected between p. gingivalis and spirochetes; and between a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum. our studies show a transitional increase  in levels of several organisms resembling putative pathogens of human peri-implant infection, associated with implant placements in partially edentulous mouths and supports early prophylactic interventions to control their  levels.

TI  == effects of lipopolysaccharides on human dental pulp cells.
AB  == human dental pulp cells were treated with 1, 10, and 100 micrograms/ml of lipopolysaccharide (lps). the effects of treatment were examined by measurement of the dna content, protein content, and alkaline phosphatase activity of the cells. lps samples were purified from porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum isolated from root canals, and escherichia coli 0111:b4 lps was used as a positive control. at a concentration of 1 microgram/ml, none of the lpss caused any change in the production of dna or protein, whereas the amount of dna was increased at 10 micrograms/ml and inhibited at 100 micrograms/ml. protein synthesis was decreased by lpss at both 10 and 100 micrograms/ml. alkaline phosphatase activity was not changed at any concentration of lps tested.

TI  == oligonucleotide probes to the 16s ribosomal rna: implications of sequence homology and secondary structure with particular reference to the oral species prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == eight oligonucleotides based upon regions of the small subunit 16s ribosomal rna  gene sequences were analysed against a background of their position within the molecule and their two-dimensional structure to rationalise their use in recognising prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens. the 41 clinical isolates from both oral and respiratory sites and two reference strains were subjected to dna-dna hybridisation and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis to confirm their identity. alignment of oligonucleotide probes designated i bi-2 to  i bi-6 (for p. intermedia) and 2bi-2 (for p. nigrescens) with the 16s rrna suggested that these probes lacked specificity or were constructed from hypervariable regions. a 52-mer oligonucleotide (designated bi) reliably detected both species. because of the high degree of concordance between the 16s rrnas of  both species, it was necessary to vary the stringency of hybridisation conditions for detection of both species. thus probe i bi-i recognised p. intermedia while i bi-i detected both p. intermedia and p. nigrescens at low stringency. however, under conditions of high stringency only p. nigrescens was recognised by probe 2bi-i. these probes were highly specific and did not hybridise with dna from the  closely related p. corporis, nor other periodontal pathogens such as fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola and several pigmented species such as prevotella melaninogenica, p. denticola, p. loescheii, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, py. endodontalis, py. gingivalis, py. levii, and py. macacae.

TI  == bacterial-stimulated cytokine production of peripheral mononuclear cells from patients of various periodontitis categories.
AB  == periodontitis is a general term for disease categories, including juvenile periodontitis (jp), rapidly progressive periodontitis (rpp), and adult periodontitis (ap), which may or may not share a common etiology and pathogenesis. these disease categories are characterized by differences in progression of tissue destruction and differences in age group susceptibility, but not, to our knowledge, by differences in cytokine responses of inflammatory cells. the present study examined blood cell counts and interindividual variation in the ability of pbmc of patients in three different categories of periodontitis to produce cytokines after stimulation with different oral bacterial species in vitro. the ap group had a significantly lower production of il-1ra when stimulated with porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.) and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.) (p < 0.05). streptococcus sanguis (s.s.), which is associated with normal periodontal conditions, induced extremely high levels of il-1 alpha and tnf alpha production in all groups. the rpp group had a significantly higher number of monocytes (mc) than the ap group (p < 0.05). additionally, jp patients had a significantly higher concentration of polymorphonuclear granulocytes compared to juvenile controls (p < 0.05). in conclusion, il-1 alpha, tnf alpha, or il-6 production by peripheral blood mc after in vitro stimulation with oral bacterial type stains may not distinguish different categories of periodontitis. the results support the hypothesis that the cytokine il-1ra is produced in different concentrations in the two groups: rpp and ap. furthermore, elevated mc concentration in the rpp group compared to the ap group may be an important pathogenic feature in rpp.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of periodontopathic bacteria associated with failing implants.
AB  == the aim of this study was to examine the subgingival microflora associated with failing implants, and to determine their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics in periodontal therapy and dental practice. thirteen partially edentulous patients with 19 failing implants were selected. clinical examination  included probing depth, attachment level, gingival index, plaque index, and radiographic analyses. two subgingival plaque samples were taken from each failing implant and analyzed for microbial composition. fusobacterium nucleatum,  porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia were the prevalent cultivable microflora. antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates was determined by the agar dilution technique. antibacterial activity of penicillin g, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and the combination amoxicillin-metronidazole was significantly higher than with other antibiotics tested. these data indicated that the commonly-used antibiotics were highly effective against bacteria isolated around failing implants, which would suggest the use of these antibiotics to control peri-implant infections.

TI  == biological activities of lipopolysaccharides from oral bacteria and their relevance to the pathogenesis of chronic periodontitis.
AB  == chronic periodontitis is a major cause of tooth loss in adults and is a consequence of the colonisation of the subgingival region by organisms such as porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. lipopolysaccharide (lps) is a constituent of the cell walls of all of these bacteria and is found in large quantities on the surfaces of periodontally-diseased teeth. lps from oral bacteria has a marked effect on most  types of cell found in the periodontal tissues including macrophages, lymphocytes, fibroblasts and osteoblasts. fibroblasts and macrophages respond to  oral lps by secreting a range of cytokines, and other effector molecules, with inflammatory, immunomodulatory and tissue-destroying capabilities. lymphocytes are stimulated by lps to produce a wide range of antibodies with different specificities, hence exacerbating the inflammatory response. by its actions on bone cells, lps can stimulate bone resorption and inhibit bone formation resulting in erosion of the tooth-supporting alveolar bone. there is, therefore,  considerable evidence implicating lps in the pathogenesis of chronic periodontitis. however, the possible involvement of other biologically-active bacterial components must not be overlooked.

TI  == degradation of immunoglobulin g by periodontal bacteria.
AB  == several subgingival microorganisms were tested for their ability to utilize human immunoglobulin g (igg) as a substrate for growth. this was done using a protein-free chemically defined medium, supplemented with igg. stimulation of growth was observed for capnocytophaga ochracea, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella oralis, lactobacillus catenaforme and streptococcus intermedius. immunoelectrophoresis, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and a protein assay demonstrated that p. intermedia and p. endodontalis completely degraded the protein chains of igg. partial breakdown of igg was observed for p. asaccharolytica and c. ochracea, whereas p. oralis cleaved the igg heavy chain, yielding fc and fab fragments. all these bacteria utilized igg as a substrate for growth. binding studies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, revealed complete loss of in vitro antigen-antibody binding capacity after incubation of specific igg with p. endodontalis and partial loss of binding with  p. intermedia, p. gingivalis, c. ochracea or fusobacterium nucleatum. degradation or inactivation of igg by oral bacteria is thought to be important in the causation of polymicrobial infections.

TI  == microbial associations of 4 putative periodontal pathogens in sudanese adult periodontitis patients determined by dna probe analysis.
AB  == the few previous cultivation studies on the in vivo associations between various  periodontal microbial species have shown several positive and negative associations. the present investigation utilized dna probe analysis to examine possible in vivo associations between the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and bacteroides forsythus in subgingival plaque samples obtained from 25 sudanese untreated adult periodontitis patients. the standard paper point technique was used to sample 99  sites with a mean probing depth of 6.8 mm (range 6.0 to 10.0). microbial associations were determined by detecting the effect of the presence or absence of one species (effector) on the occurrence of the other 3 species (target). the  wilcoxon signed rank test was used to examine variations in occurrence of each target bacteria in the presence or absence of the effector. in addition, the spearman's rank correlation test was used to assess the relationship between the  level of each bacteria to that of the other 3. results showed bacterial associations with the following effector-on-target effects: f. nucleatum (p < 0.01 wilcoxon; p < 0.001 spearman) >> p. gingivalis (p < 0.01 wilcoxon; p < 0.001 spearman), and b. forsythus (p < 0.05 wilcoxon; p < 0.001 spearman) > p. intermedia (p < 0.01 spearman). the study demonstrated positive associations between the 4 species investigated, while no neutral or negative associations were revealed. the most striking finding was the effect exerted by f. nucleatum on the colonization of p. intermedia; p. intermedia was never detected in a site  unless f. nucleatum was also present.

TI  == effect of treatment on some periodontopathogens and their antibody levels in periodontal abscesses.
AB  == twenty patients suffering from abscess of periodontal origin were treated and followed clinically and microbiologically for 6 months. microbiological examination was performed by culture technique. one deep and one shallow periodontal pocket in the same patient were examined concomitantly. serum was collected and analyzed for specific antibody level using elisa methodology. treatment included supragingival scaling, drainage, and irrigation of the periodontal pocket with 0.85% sodium chloride and systemic tetracycline administration, 1 g per day for 2 weeks. at baseline, 90% of the abscesses harbored porphyromonas gingivalis and/or prevotella intermedia. after 6 months, abscess sites demonstrated a reduced probing depth, less bleeding on probing, and gain of attachment. abscess sites showed no p. gingivalis and the proportion of p. intermedia was significantly reduced 6 months after treatment. in deep periodontal pockets a similar pattern was seen. shallow pockets demonstrated few  clinical signs of inflammation and the number of bacteria was generally low. campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga spp, and fusobacterium nucleatum were frequently seen in low numbers in most sites during the study period, while actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was detected only in a few sites. the igg levels in patient sera against antigens of homologous bacterial strains remained  fairly constant for 6 months. the result of the present study indicates that p. gingivalis and p. intermedia are involved in periodontal abscess formation. also, treatment where drainage is combined with tetracycline administration promotes healing and reattachment.

AB  == cytotoxicity in culture media of various growing bacterial strains was estimated  by cr-51 release of labelled target-cells. interaction studies were made by adding each of the different uv-killed bacteria to the medium with viable bacteria. the reference oral bacterial strains were: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus mitis, which were compared with the reference bacteria staphylococcus aureus 209 and staphylococcus epidermidis. the target cells were:  gingival fibroblasts (gf), periodontal membrane fibroblasts (pmf), pulpal fibroblasts (pf), hela-cells (hela), and lymphoid neoplasm cells (ln). synergistic, as well as antagonistic, effects on target cells were observed. the  cytotoxicity of a. actinomycetemcomitans in presence of p. gingivalis is neutralized while in presence of s. aureus it was increased. bacterial interactions with f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis cytotoxicity were observed. the  cytotoxicity of f. nucleatum was increased when cultured together with a. actinomycetemcomitans. each cell type reacted differently to the toxicity of the  supernatant of growth medium in which the same bacterial strain had been cultivated, which indicates cell specificity of the toxins.

TI  == effect of proteolytic enzymes on the lysis and growth of oral bacteria.
AB  == previous studies have shown increased levels of proteolytic enzymes in affected periodontal sites. the aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effect of proteolytic environments on the lysis and growth of selected oral bacteria associated with either healthy or diseased periodontal sites. the effect of trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase k on cell lysis was determined following  incubation with bacteria, whereas the effect of the same proteolytic enzymes on bacterial growth was tested using a disc-plate technique. overall, gram-positive  bacteria appeared to be more resistant to lysis than gram-negative bacteria. the  most susceptible bacteria were actinomyces spp., eubacterium saburreum, prevotella intermedia, capnocytophaga ochracea, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loescheii, treponema denticola and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the disc-plate procedure indicated that the growth of actinomyces spp., e. saburreum, c. ochracea, p. intermedia, p. loescheii, porphyromonas gingivalis and t. denticola were the most affected, more particularly by chymotrypsin and proteinase k. interestingly, the growth of f. nucleatum was rather stimulated by proteolytic enzymes. the observations reported in this investigation indicate that specific and general proteolytic activities have the ability to lyse some oral bacterial species and to interfere with their  growth. it is suggested that such effects could represent new mechanisms by which the bacterial ecology of subgingival sites may be affected.

AB  == eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. the composition of oral gram-negative anaerobic microflora was investigated in 21 young children (mean age 32 months) with primary dentition. the bacterial findings of samples were compared with those of the same children collected at their edentulous infant period (mean age 3 months). during the primary period, 2 samples were collected from each child: a sample with dental floss from gingival margin of 2 teeth and stimulated saliva pooled with a mucosal swab sample. both samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically using nonselective and selective media. prevotella  melaninogenica, nonpigmented prevotella spp., fusobacterium nucleatum group and capnocytophaga spp. were found in all children at the older age, whereas they occurred in edentulous mouth in 76%, 62%, 67% and 19%, respectively. the occurrence of prevotella loescheii increased from 14% to 90%, prevotella intermedia from 10% to 67%, leptotrichia spp. from 24 to 71%, campylobacter (wolinella) spp. from 5 to 43% and eikenella corrodens from 5 to 57%. only the occurrence of bacteroides gracilis and veillonella spp. remained at about the same level. species not isolated from the edentulous mouth, such as prevotella denticola, fusobacterium spp. other than the f. nucleatum group and selenomonas spp. were now detected in 71%, 71% and 43% of the children. the stability of the  colonizing p. melaninogenica strain(s) in the oral cavity was determined by using ribotyping; 1-2 isolates per child from the edentulous infant period of 9 children and 3-15 isolates per child from their primary dentition period were analyzed.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == we have assessed macaca fascicularis as a potential model in which to test the efficacy and safety of a vaccine for periodontitis. twenty-eight animals were surveyed and 20 studied in more detail. clinical periodontal status was assessed, the subgingival microflora analyzed especially for the presence and proportions of porphyromonas gingivalis and titers and avidities of serum antibodies reactive with p. gingivalis measured. probing depths ranged from 0.90 mm to 3.80 mm, gingival index scores from 0.00 to 4.00 and plaque index scores from 0.00 to 3.00. about 40% of sites bled on probing. the animals manifested a subgingival flora characteristic of the anaerobic gram-negative bacteria found in human periodontal pockets, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. p. gingivalis was detected in 70 of 80 samples studied, ranging from 0.01% to 20% of the total flora. serum antibody reactive with antigens of p. gingivalis was observed in all animals, with titers ranging from 1.0 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) unit to 25 elisa units and avidities from 0.10 m to 2.20 m. antibody titer and maximum percentage of p. gingivalis were inversely correlated, indicating that a humoral immune response may be effective in reducing p. gingivalis overgrowth. m. fascicularis appears to be an excellent model for use in vaccine development.

TI  == adherence of oral microorganisms to guided tissue membranes: an in vitro study.
AB  == microorganisms can adhere and colonize on an exposed guided tissue regeneration (gtr) membrane thus developing a nidus of infection. the purpose of this study was to compare early bacterial adhesion to three different gtr membranes. expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, polyglactin 910, and collagen were used as the  test membranes. in part i of this study 15 different oral microbes were used to compare their relative ability to adhere to the membranes. six of the most strongly adherent bacteria (actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and selenomonas sputigena) were selected for part ii of  this study. the membranes were placed in tubes containing broth cultures containing identical concentrations (1 x 10(8) cells/ml) of these bacteria at 37  degrees c. membranes were placed in tubes of media without bacteria as controls.  at 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours, the bacterial cultures were decanted and the membranes in the tubes were agitated gently in reduced transfer fluid (rtf) 4 times to remove non-adherent bacteria. each tube was then sonicated for 30 seconds in 10 ml rtf to detach adherent bacteria. the detached adherent bacteria were counted using a petroff-hausser chamber. data were analyzed by using the sas program. analysis of variance was used to test for differences between multiple means. results showed s. mutans had the strongest attachment to the collagen membrane at 4 and 6 hours. selenomonas sputigena had the lowest adherence capability to all test membranes. polyglactin 910 had significantly (p < 0.05) lower s. mutants adherence than either the eptfe or the collagen membrane at 4 and 6 hours.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == relationship between salivary blood group antigens, microbial flora and periodontal condition in young adults.
AB  == to investigate a possible role for salivary blood-group antigens in the relative  frequencies of selected periodontal pathogens and commensal oral micro-organisms, we studied the clinical and microbiological condition in young adults with or without blood group reactive substances in saliva (secretors or non-secretors respectively). clinical measurements were recorded at the ramfjord teeth in 81 1st-year dental students. in addition, presence of interproximal loss of attachment (la) was assessed at sites with a pocket depth of > or = 4 mm. microbiological samples were taken from one of the ramfjord teeth (site without interproximal la), from interproximal sites of > or = 4 mm in conjunction with la, and from the saliva. the samples were analyzed for the presence of actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. clinically, no statistically significant differences were found in the periodontal status between secretors (78% of our population) and non-secretors. furthermore, the occurrence of the monitored micro-organisms was not correlated to the secretor status. it is concluded that bacterial colonization with the micro-organisms tested in this study, apparently occurred independent of secretor status. among the periodontal  pathogens, only p. intermedia was more frequently recovered from the saliva of subjects with interproximal la (49%) than in those without (33%; p = 0.03). this  finding was irrespective of the secretor status. therefore, p. intermedia may be  an important micro-organism in relation to the onset of periodontal destruction in young adults.

TI  == use of the syrian golden hamster for the induction of intraoral abscesses by sutures contaminated with human subgingival plaque.
AB  == analysis of normal oral flora in 150 cheek pouches of hamsters (mesocricetus auratus) defined the microbial working environment and demonstrated the absence of human oral black-pigmented bacteria. silk sutures saturated with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia or subgingival plaque were used to close wounds made in hamster's cheek pouches. abscesses were formed when sutures had solitary  p. gingivalis or other bacteria mixed with p. gingivalis or when p. intermedia was mixed with other bacteria besides p. gingivalis. a concentration of black-pigmented bacteria emanating from 3 x 10(5) colony-forming units/inoculum was required for abscess formation. six abscesses (14.3%) were developed in association with the presence of other odontopathic bacteria, primarily fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces viscosus. the hamster cheek pouch with iatrogenic wounds closed with plaque-impregnated sutures is a novel and effective model to study the pathology of wound infections and virulence of human subgingival organisms.

TI  == modeling the relationship between clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic parameters and alveolar bone levels in an elderly population.
AB  == a cross-sectional periodontal study of 74 subjects aged 65 to 75 years was performed. clinical data were collected and related to microbiological and immunological data. a statistical model (step-wise multiple regression) of factors related to bone loss was created initially using clinical data only; then by adding either the microbiologic or immunologic data; and then by using clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic data together. when only clinical data were considered, three factors were found to have significant positive correlations with bone loss. tooth mobility accounted for 17% of the variability  in the alveolar bone level measurements, probing depth for 12%(r2), and plaque index for 3%, for a total of 32% of the variability explained by these clinical factors. tooth mobility and probing depth were clinical factors which remained significant in the model when the microbiological data were also considered. as percentages of the total cultivable microbiota, e. corrodens (r2 = 14%) and black-pigmenting prevotella intermedia (r2 = 4%) correlated positively with alveolar bone loss. the addition of the microbiologic data only increased the r2  to 33%. when immunological data were considered with the clinical data, pocket depth and tooth mobility were the clinical parameters which remained in the model. igg antibody levels to p. gingivalis w83 and/or 381 (r2 = 24%) a. actinomycetemcomitans 627 (r2 = 2%) were the significant immunologic measures having a positive correlation with bone loss. anti-f. nucleatum levels had a significant negative correlation. a total of 50% of the variability in alveolar bone level was accounted for in the model by the addition of specific serum antibody levels to subgingival plaque microorganisms. when clinical, microbiological, and immunological measurements were all considered together, antibody to p. gingivalis w83 and/or 381 (r2 = 42%), percentage of b-lymphocytes  (r2 = 3%), probing depth (r2 = 4%), anti-e. corrodens levels (r2 = 2%), and anti-p. gingivalis 33277 levels (r2 = 4%) all had significant positive correlation with loss of alveolar bone. the number of enteric bacteria, anti-f. nucleatum levels, and anti-p. intermedia levels each had a significant negative correlation with alveolar bone heights. the r2 for this model was 75%. these results indicated that antibody levels to subgingival plaque microorganisms and tooth mobility were the best predictors of bone loss in the elderly patients tested in this study.

TI  == detection of porphyromonas gingivalis in gingival exudate by a dipeptide-enhanced trypsin-like activity.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis in subgingival plaque is an important risk factor for future periodontal attachment loss in susceptible adults. the elimination of p. gingivalis is usually concomitant with a healing process. therefore, it should be valuable to have an easy chairside method to follow the effect of periodontal treatment on p. gingivalis detection as well as on its eventual reappearance during the maintenance period. we have previously reported the stimulation of amidolytic activity of p. gingivalis by the addition of glycyl-glycine to the assay buffer. in this study we determined the proportions of p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga spp, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens by cultivation technique and the amidolytic activity, using n-benzoyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanilide (bapna) as substrate, in gingival exudate before and during a 3-year treatment and maintenance period. p. gingivalis was the only species yielding a high and persistent correlation to stimulated amidolytic activity (p values < or = 0.0001) on both site (r = 0.5) and subject (r = 0.8) level. testing pure cultures of suggested periodontal pathogens for effect of glycyl-glycine on amidolytic activity, we found that of p. gingivalis to be 5.9-fold increased. the amidolytic activity of treponema denticola was only slightly stimulated (ratio with/without glycyl-glycine = 1.2) and that of capnocytophaga slightly inhibited (ratio with/without glycyl-glycine = 0.8). the  outcome of this study has the potential to be used for the development of a simple, rapid, and inexpensive assay for a qualitative and quantitative determination of p. gingivalis in gingival crevicular fluid.

TI  == a comparison of two transport media for saliva and subgingival samples.
AB  == this study has shown that microorganisms associated with caries (mutans streptococci, lactobacilli) and marginal periodontitis (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) in pure culture can be stored in vmga or reduced transport fluid and be recovered sufficiently after 24 h. sufficient recovery after 24 h of mail transport was also obtained in 37 saliva samples obtained from adults and 80 subgingival samples from a group of patients before and 3, 6 and 15 months after periodontal treatment. the samples transported in vmga iii showed in comparison to the samples transported in reduced transport fluid a higher recovery rate as well as a higher percentage of  the total viable count for investigated anaerobic species. this was explained by  the different composition of the two media and also by the gel consistency of vmga iii, which maintains a low redox-potential even during transport after transferring a sample into the medium. in a few samples aerobic bacteria increased in both media.

AB  == the purposes of this study were to determine if: 1) an association exists between cigarette smoking and signs of periodontal disease after controlling for the confounding variables of age, sex, plaque, and calculus; 2) the prevalence of 5 bacteria commonly associated with periodontal disease differs between smokers and non-smokers; and 3) the presence of any of these bacteria or smoking are associated with a mean proximal posterior probing depth > or = 3.5 mm. plaque, calculus, gingivitis, and probing depth were measured at the proximal surfaces of all teeth in one randomly selected posterior dental sextant in 615 adults. subgingival plaque was sampled from the same sites and assayed for the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, eikenella corrodens, and fusobacterium nucleatum. a subsample of non-smokers (n = 126), who were similar to smokers (n = 63) with respect to age,  sex, plaque, and calculus, was randomly drawn from the original sample. these two groups were then compared on the basis of clinical and microbial parameters. the  results indicated that the odds of having a mean probing depth > or = 3.5 mm were 5 times greater for smokers than the non-smoker subsample (odds ratio = 5.3; 95%  ci = 2.0 to 13.8). no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of any of the bacteria was found between smokers and the non-smoker subsample. based on logistic regression analyses of each of the 5 bacteria and smoking, mean probing depth > or = 3.5 mm was significantly associated with the presence of a.  actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia, e. corrodens, and smoking (p < 0.05).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the antimicrobial activity of prevention mouthrinse.
AB  == prevention mouthrinse was designed to serve as a vital supplement to normal oral  hygiene procedures. to determine the antimicrobial potency of this mouthrinse, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics), bactericidal kinetics, and short-term exposure studies were conducted. a spectrum of oral microorganisms was employed in this investigation: streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, serratia  marcescens and candida albicans. microorganisms were cultured in standard enriched media and under appropriate atmospheric conditions. inhibition assays were conducted in tubes, with each mouthrinse dilution assayed in triplicate. mic determinations revealed that all of the microorganisms studied were highly susceptible to prevention mouthrinse, with mics ranging from 16-fold to 128-fold  dilutions. bactericidal kinetics assays showed rapid killing of the test organisms in the presence of the mouthrinse. brief (5-minute) exposure of s. mutans to 8-fold diluted mouthrinse resulted in a substantial delay in growth. under the constraints of this type of study, prevention mouthrinse exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against all of the microorganisms studied. we support the notion that prevention mouthrinse may be a valuable supplement to normal oral hygiene procedures. a 6-month clinical trial assessing the in vivo efficacy of prevention mouthrinse is currently being conducted.

TI  == an in vivo study of the influence of the surface roughness of implants on the microbiology of supra- and subgingival plaque.
AB  == in nine patients with fixed prostheses supported by endosseous titanium implants, 2 titanium abutments (transmucosal part of the implant) were replaced by either an unused standard abutment or a roughened titanium abutment. after 3 months of habitual oral hygiene, plaque samples were taken for differential phase-contrast  microscopy, dna probe analysis, and culturing. supragingivally, rough abutments harbored significantly fewer coccoid micro-organisms (64 vs. 81%), which is indicative of a more mature plaque. subgingivally, the observations depended on the sampling procedure. for plaque collected with paper points, only minor qualitative and quantitative differences between both substrata could be registered. however, when the microbiota adhering to the abutment were considered, rough surfaces harbored 25 times more bacteria, with a slightly lower density of coccoid organisms. the presence and density of periodontal pathogens subgingivally were, however, more related to the patient's dental status than to  the surface characteristics of the abutments. these results justify the search for optimal surface smoothness for all intra-oral and intra-sulcular hard surfaces for reduction of bacterial colonization and of periodontal pathogens.

TI  == role of suspected periodontopathogens in microbiological monitoring of periodontitis.
AB  == periodontal disease is the clinical result of a complex interaction between the host and plaque bacteria. although a specificity to some degree is found for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp), it has been difficult to obtain evidence for a specific etiological role of the bacteria associated with periodontal disease in adults. what we see is the net result of host-parasite interactions which in an unpredictable moment accumulate  and exceed the threshold of tissue integrity. this hypothesis is concomitant with the view of periodontal disease as a polymicrobial infection, predominantly anaerobic, which occurs commonly in the oral cavity or elsewhere in the body. some micro-organisms (risk markers) occur more frequently than others and may significantly determine the outcome of this host-parasite interaction. microbiological sampling and analysis seem to be of limited value in risk assessment; however, they can be used as tools in diagnosis in ljp patients and acute infections, and in treatment decision and therapy control in "refractory" patients. suspected pathogens (risk markers) are actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and some species of spirochetes, while the roles of prevotella intermedia, bacteroidesforsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, and peptostreptococcus micros are more uncertain. the presence of periodontopathogens as well as enterics, staphylococcus aureus and candida especially, should be considered in patients with systemic individual disorders--e.g., diabetes mellitus, neutropenia, agranulocytosis, and aids--or with implants.

AB  == twenty-eight young, healthy adults completed an experimental gingivitis study in  which blood and clinical recordings were obtained at baseline; after a 4-week period of thorough oral hygiene; after a subsequent 3-week period of plaque accumulation; and after another 2 weeks of thorough oral hygiene. serum immunoglobulin g antibodies against whole cells of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus sanguis were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. mean serum immunoglobulin g antibody levels to p. intermedia, f. nucleatum and s. sanguis remained essentially constant during the experiment, whereas the immunoglobulin g antibodies to p. gingivalis declined during the initial period of oral hygiene and the subsequent period of plaque accumulation to an average of 84.5% of the baseline value. this reduction could be attributed to the people who developed marked gingival inflammation during the period of plaque accumulation, indicating that the systemic host response may be associated with local tissue responses to  variations in oral hygiene. these people were, however, also characterized by higher initial serum immunoglobulin g responses to p. gingivalis than people who  developed less pronounced gingival inflammation during the experiment. the variability and individuality noted in the host response to potential pathogens have important implications for attempts to use such measures for establishing a  diagnosis or prognosis for the individual patient.

AB  == the macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey is one of several non-human primate (nhp) models for periodontal disease. this report presents the bacteriology of the gingival sulci in m. mulatta monkeys. three sub-gingival sites (maxillary right central incisor, the disto-buccal of the mandibular left second molar and mesio-buccal of the mandibular right second molar) of 9 monkeys were evaluated clinically before scaling and 7 days after scaling. plaque samples were obtained  from sub-gingival sites before clinical examination and studied bacteriologically by dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and by primary phenotypic characterizations of culture isolates. several gingival sites presented with mild gingival inflammation. anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic  bacteria were the predominant flora colonizing the gingival sulci. the major microbial groups were haemophilus species (100% of sites; percentage of total anaerobic count (tac): 21-51), peptostreptococcus micros (89%, 7.5-29.5), actinomyces sp. (85%, 7-27), fusobacterium nucleatum (90%, 5-8), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (73%, 1.3-12), black-pigmented anaerobic rods (bpar) (80%,  0.6-6.5) and oral streptococci (80%, 0.2-1.0). microbial groups detected less often were wolinella sp.

(28%, 0-0.1) and spirochetes (4.7%, 0-0.07). seven days after gingival sites were scaled, the plaque score and indices for gingival inflammation declined significantly. the gingival flora after scaling were characterized by lower proportions of the actinomyces sp., p.  micros and bpar; and increased proportions of the oral streptococci, relative to  pre-scaling levels.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == monoclonal antibodies to lipopolysaccharide of four oral bacteria associated with periodontal disease.
AB  == periodontal disease is a common inflammatory disease which erodes the supporting  structures of the teeth, and is initiated by a subgingival infection with selected gram-negative bacteria. monoclonal antibodies (mab) to lipopolysaccharide (lps) of four periodontal pathogens, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia, f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis were examined for specificity and their ability to bind these pathogens in a particle concentration fluorescence immunoassay (pcfia). the mab selected were specific for their homologous bacteria and when tested against a large battery of other bacteria, including 16 genera and 46 species, were found not to cross-react with heterologous species. when each of the mab was challenged with 40 or more homologous freshly isolated bacteria, more than 90% were positive. non-cellular antigens in the form of soluble lps and extracellular vesicles were examined for their ability to bind to assay components and alter the apparent results of the assay. lps was found to have potential as an interfering agent if bound to assay components prior to sample treatment, but this non-specific binding was significantly reduced when a  surfactant was added to the buffers. extracellular vesicles had no significant effect on the estimation of p. gingivalis by the assay.

TI  == the effects of triclosan and zinc citrate, alone and in combination, on a community of oral bacteria grown in vitro.
AB  == a mixed-culture chemostat system has been used as a more stringent laboratory system for evaluation of the antimicrobial effects of triclosan and zinc citrate. the inhibitors were added alone, and in combination, as a pulse (a high initial inhibitor concentration which decreased with time) or as a dose (concentration of inhibitor increased with time) to give maximum concentrations of 34.5 mumol/l triclosan and 39.8 mumol/l zinc citrate. when dosed, triclosan inhibited a. viscosus and all five gram-negative species, whereas zinc citrate had less effect, probably due to complexation by media components. similar effects were seen when triclosan was pulsed, except that s. mutans was the most sensitive gram-positive species and v. dispar was unaffected. however, when the inhibitors  were dosed or pulsed in combination, marked complementary and additive inhibitory effects were observed, particularly against gram-negative species, although s. gordonii and s. oralis were relatively unaffected. the data confirm that increased effects can be obtained with suitable combinations of antimicrobial agents and suggest that, under certain conditions, apparently broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents may be acting more selectively than hitherto suspected.

TI  == correlation between thermal sensitivity and microorganisms isolated from deep carious dentin.
AB  == the correlation between thermal sensitivity and the microorganisms present in 29  deep carious lesions was studied. the numbers of lactobacilli and total gram-positive rods in the carious lesions were found to be negatively related to  the length of pain triggered by cold and heat stimulants. the presence of gram-positive cocci and non-black-pigmented bacteroides were positively associated with both cold and heat sensitivities. black-pigmented bacteroides, streptococcus mutans, and total anaerobic colony counts were positively related to the heat sensitivity. recovery of fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces viscosus, and enterics on the selective plates was associated with cold sensitivity. total counts of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods on the anaerobic nonselective medium were positively related to the cold sensitivity. it appeared that teeth with low numbers of lactobacilli in the carious lesions usually responded to thermal tests with longer duration of pain. conversely, teeth with high numbers of lactobacilli in the carious lesions usually responded  with shorter duration of pain.

TI  == phosphorylated nutrient uptake by treponema denticola and other potential periodontopathogens.
AB  == nutrient uptake may contribute to the survival of certain potential periodontopathogens in the competitive environment of the gingival sulcus. this study was conducted to assess the uptake of commercially available, key radiolabelled phosphorylated compounds by treponema denticola. there was a linear relationship in the uptake of atp and g-1-p with cell concentrations of 0.1-2.5 mg of cell dry weight. this uptake reached a steady state within 15 min, and at temperatures of 25-37 degrees c the uptake ranged between 13-21%. at 50 degrees c, or above 50 degrees c the assay cells took up 0-1% of the assay nutrients. the maximum uptake of atp was 47.5, 38 and 47.6 pmoles for serovars a, b and c. g-1-p yielded maximum uptake values of 306, 304, and 306 pmoles respectively. significant uptake of atp, or g-1-p occurred at ph 4.8 for serovars a, or c, while serovar b showed a broad ph range for the uptake of g-1-p. stannous fluoride at a concentration of 0.17 mm enhanced the uptake of atp while chlorhexidine digluconate inhibited the uptake of atp. at concentrations usually  employed (0.05-0.5 mm) the metabolic poisons 2,4-dinitrophenol, sodium azide, sodium arsenite and the atpase inhibitor n,n1-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide did not alter significantly the uptake of atp. the uptake of atp, by actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and t. denticola at ph 4.8 was 13.4, 1.5, 6.9, and 18-20.4%, respectively. at ph 6.5 the uptake for the microorganisms indicated above was 22, 1.3, 6.6 and 6.2%, respectively. g-1-p showed the same trend in its uptake by a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum and t. denticola. this study provides for the first time specific examples of phosphorylated nutrient uptake by potential periodontopathogens, and that the uptake of phosphorylated nutrients can be suppressed by oral hygienic compounds.

TI  == development and characterization of porphyromonas gingivalis-specific rat t-cell  clones.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis has been implicated as a major pathogen in periodontitis. to determine the role of t cells in the regulation of this disease, a method was developed for the generation and characterization of rat t-cell clones with antigen specificity to p. gingivalis whole cells. the clones studied so far demonstrated a t-helper (th) phenotype w3/13+, w3/25+, ox8- and ox22-. these t-cell clones proliferated in vitro in response to p. gingivalis, but not to other bacteria (prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, wolinella recta, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus sanguis). limiting dilution analysis showed w3/25+, ox8- t cells preferentially respond to p. gingivalis, rather than w3/25-, ox8+ t cells. p. gingivalis-reactive w3/25+ t cells belonged to the ox22- population, suggesting that the ox22- t cells may represent memory cells. all clones tested produced interferon gamma, but not interleukin 2. the cloned t-cell f1 significantly enhanced p. gingivalis-specific antibody production (p < 0.03). the availability  of these cloned t cells should bring new insight into the mechanism by which t cells regulate oral health and periodontal disease.

TI  == sensitization of oral bacteria in biofilms to killing by light from a low-power laser.
AB  == biofilms of streptococcus sanguis, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were prepared on the surfaces  of agar plates and a number of compounds were screened for their ability to sensitize bacteria in these biofilms to killing by light from a 7.3 mw helium/neon (he/ne) laser. toluidine blue o and methylene blue enabled detectable killing of all four target organisms after exposure to he/ne light for 30 s. aluminium disulphonated phthalocyanine, haematoporphyrin hcl and haematoporphyrin ester were effective photosensitizers of only some of the target organisms. these findings suggest that lethal photosensitization may be an effective means of eliminating periodontopathogenic bacteria from dental plaque.

TI  == relationship between oral gram-negative anaerobic bacteria in saliva of the mother and the colonization of her edentulous infant.
AB  == various gram-negative anaerobic bacterial species can be detected in the oral flora of edentulous infants. however, knowledge of the initial infection source is still scarce. thirty caucasian mothers (mean age 30 years) and their edentulous infants (mean age 3 months) were examined for the possible similarity  of the oral gram-negative anaerobic flora. paraffin-stimulated saliva was collected from the mothers. a pooled swab sample from mucosal surfaces and unstimulated saliva were collected from the infants. the samples were inoculated  on nonselective and selective media and cultured aerobically and anaerobically. all of the 30 mothers harbored fusobacterium nucleatum and 29 mothers prevotella  melaninogenica in their saliva. the salivary levels of p. melaninogenica, f. nucleatum, nonpigmented prevotella spp., prevotella intermedia and prevotella loescheii exceeded 10(4) cfu/ml in about half of the 30 mothers. at this maternal salivary level, the infants' colonization frequency of p. melaninogenica and f. nucleatum was doubled. a positive correlation between maternal salivary concentration and infant's colonization was found for p. melaninogenica. no positive association was found with nonpigmented prevotella spp., p. intermedia and p. loescheii. it can be speculated that maternal saliva may act as a source of some gram-negative anaerobes in the oral microflora of edentulous infants as early as before tooth eruption.

TI  == associations between microbial species in dental root canal infections.
AB  == the existence of commensal or antagonistic relationships between microorganisms in the root canals of teeth with apical periodontitis was investigated. samples were taken from 65 infected human root canals and were analysed according to species, frequency of occurrence and proportion of the total isolated flora. the  most frequent species were fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, eubacterium alactolyticum, eubacterium lentum and wolinella recta. an odds ratio system was used to calculate positive or negative associations between the isolated bacteria. strong positive associations were found between f. nucleatum and p. micros, porphyromonas endodontalis, selenomonas sputigena and w. recta. there was also a positive association between p. intermedia and p. micros, p. anaerobius and the eubacteria. in general, species of streptococci, propionibacterium propionica, capnocytophaga ochracea and veillonella parvula showed no or negative associations with the other bacteria. the results are consistent with the concept of a special and selective environment occurring in the root canal that is due, in part, to the cooperative as well as antagonistic nature of the relationships between bacteria in the root canal.

TI  == comparison of the effects of galactose and glucose on the ph responses of human dental plaque, salivary sediment and pure cultures of oral bacteria.
AB  == comparisons made in dental plaque in vivo demonstrated that galactose produces a  significantly smaller decrease in ph than does glucose. in vitro studies with plaque, salivary sediment and pure cultures of oral bacteria done in the absence  of intraoral factors such as flowing saliva confirmed this lesser acidogenicity of galactose. pure culture showed that most of the bacteria tested produce a moderate to large decrease with glucose but only a few do so with galactose; most produced a moderate to little or no ph response with this sugar. this suggested that the smaller decreases in ph seen in plaque in vivo with galactose were largely due to bacterial differences, basically that resident micro-organisms individually have less galactolytic than glucolytic capability. variance in capability was attributed to differences in membrane transport processes and metabolic pathways normally available to bacteria for galactose and glucose catabolism. in the in vitro experiments, because plaque and sediment can produce  base as readily as they can produce acid, the nitrogenous substrates identified earlier as major stimulants of base formation, urea and arginine, were concurrently examined for their attenuating effects on the galactose and glucose  ph responses. these showed, consistent with its lesser acidogenicity, that galactose could be countered more readily in its ability to reduce the ph by either of these two base-forming substrates than could glucose. the effects were  different with urea and with arginine, urea attenuation occurred sooner and arginine attenuation later in both plaque and sediment. the corresponding acid-base ph profiles for pure cultures were different.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == role of porphyromonas gingivalis 40-kda outer membrane protein in the aggregation of p. gingivalis vesicles and actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, an important pathogen in periodontitis, produces extracellular vesicles that aggregate with actinomyces viscosus cells. a 40-kda outer membrane protein (omp)-coding gene from p. gingivalis was cloned and the protein was found to be localized in these vesicles. the recombinant 40-kda omp did not show aggregation activity. however, affinity-purified antibody against the recombinant protein significantly inhibited aggregation of p. gingivalis vesicles with a. viscosus cells. the antibody also inhibited cellular coaggregation of several strains of p. gingivalis with a. viscosus cells, but not with other periodontal pathogens. moreover, aggregation of a. viscosus cells with p. gingivalis vesicles was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by pre-treatment  of the a. viscosus cells with the recombinant protein. these findings suggest that the 40-kda omp may be an important aggregation factor of p. gingivalis.

AB  == human t cell lines (tcls) were obtained by stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) with the 2 periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis fdc-381 and fusobacterium nucleatum fdc-263. after the first round of  stimulation and rest, the cells responded specifically to the bacteria originally used to establish each line. throughout the culture period, the responsiveness of each of the tcls to their specific bacteria increased. phenotypic analysis of the tcls revealed heterogeneity of cell types. in both tcls approximately 80% of the  cells were t cells, all of which bore the alpha beta t cell receptor. the p. gingivalis-reactive tcl (pg-tcl) showed approximately equal proportions of cd4+ and cd8+ cells, whereas the f. nucleatum-reactive tcl (fn-tcl) was predominantly  cd4+. the expression of cd25, hla-dr, cd45ra and cd29 on these cd4+ cells varied  throughout the culture period of 45 days. these results demonstrate that it is possible to establish long-term t cell lines reacting to specific periodontopathic bacteria.

AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is a gram-negative anaerobic bacterium associated with various forms of periodontal disease. several characteristics of p. gingivalis are thought to contribute to its pathogenicity; these include haemagglutination and trypsin-like protease activity. previous studies suggest an association between haemagglutination and trypsin-like protease activity of p. gingivalis. to investigate this, two complementary quantitative experimental approaches were taken. five independent mutants of p. gingivalis deficient in trypsin-like protease activity were shown to exhibit reduced haemagglutination activity. in addition, enhancers (cysteine and dithiothreitol) and inhibitors (n-ethylmaleimide, n-p-tosyl-l-lysine-chloromethyl ketone, and phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride) of trypsin-like protease activity were shown, respectively, to significantly enhance and inhibit haemagglutination activity of  washed, wild-type p. gingivalis cells (p less than 0.05, paired t-test). statistical analysis indicated a strong correlation between haemagglutination and trypsin-like protease activity (r = 0.85, p less than 0.001, spearman rank correlation). the effect of the protease enhancers and inhibitors on haemagglutination activity was specific for p. gingivalis, as they did not significantly change the haemagglutination activity of fusobacterium nucleatum. these results suggest that the proteolytic site of the trypsin-like protease participates in haemagglutination activity of p. gingivalis.

TI  == the effect of 3 mouthrinses on plaque and gingivitis development.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 3 mouthrinses, listerine antiseptic (thymol), peridex (chlorhexidine), perimed (povidone iodine and hydrogen peroxide), and a placebo (water) on the development of dental plaque and gingivitis, when used as the only oral hygiene procedure for 14 days. 71 subjects were entered into a randomized, double-blind study. at the baseline examination,  papillary bleeding score (pbs), and plaque index (pi) were registered, after which subjects received supragingival prophylaxis and were assigned to 1 of 4 study cells. subjects were asked to refrain from all oral hygiene procedures except for the supervised 14-day 2 x daily rinsing with the assigned preparation. at day 14, the same clinical parameters were again registered. statistical analysis was performed by a one-way analysis of variance (anova) to compare the 4 groups, followed by duncan's multiple range test to determine specific group differences. at baseline, average pbs and pi scores were similar for all 4 groups. after 14 days, the average pbs for peridex and perimed was significantly  lower than for listerine antiseptic and water. the frequency of interdental units with a pbs greater than 2 was significantly lower for peridex and perimed than for listerine antiseptic and water. we concluded that both peridex and perimed were effective in reducing plaque and gingivitis when used as a 2 x daily mouthrinse by subjects refraining from other oral hygiene procedures. in vitro, a synergistic effect was assumed when inhibition was achieved with perimed at the same or greater dilution than was achieved with povidone-iodine alone.

TI  == phenotypic analysis of b-cells extracted from human periodontal disease tissue.
AB  == b-cells extracted from periodontal disease tissue were analyzed for the presence  of activation markers using a range of monoclonal antibodies. in adult periodontitis (ap), 6% of b-cells expressed the il-2 receptor (cd25) compared with 1-2% in peripheral blood and healthy or marginal gingivitis (h/mg) gingival  b-cells. there was also an increase in the mean percentage of igd-positive b-cells and a decrease in cd21 and cd22 expression. in both ap and h/mg lesions,  20-22% of the b-cells expressed cd23 compared with less than 5% in peripheral blood. as b-cells are activated by day 3 in culture and start differentiating into immunoglobulin-secreting cells by day 6, b-cell phenotypes were assayed at these times in this study. following stimulation with the periodontopathic bacterium porphyromonas gingivalis, the expression of cd23, cd21 and cd22 on b-cells extracted from ap lesions remained relatively constant over the 6-d culture period. however, with fusobacterium nucleatum stimulation, there was a significant decrease in cd23, cd21 and cd22 expression after 3 d in culture, which corresponds to the activation time for b-cells. these results show that b-cells extracted from periodontal disease tissue display a range of activation markers and on stimulation, demonstrate differing responses to individual periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == the microflora of periodontal sites showing active destructive progression.
AB  == 20 adult periodontitis (ap) subjects were examined every 2 to 4 months and microbiological samples were collected and cultured when 2 mm or more loss of attachment (active sites) was detected by 2 examiners. similar sites in which no  progressive destruction was observed (control sites) also were sampled in the same subjects. by lambda-analysis, there was no statistically significant difference in floras of active (42 sites from 12 subjects) and control (36 sites  from 12 subjects) sites or between the floras of the active and control sites and of 63 samples from 22 ap subjects that were examined previously in a cross-sectional study. by paired t test, no microbial species had a significantly greater association with active than with control sites. the only species that were detected in one or more samples from all subjects with active sites were wolinella recta, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus micros. porphyromonas gingivalis and 9 other taxa were isolated from one-half or more of  the persons with active sites. the composition of microbiological floras of all periodontitis samples was statistically significantly different from that of subjects with healthy gingiva. the composition of microfloras of sites in subjects with naturally-occurring gingivitis was intermediate between that of subjects with healthy gingiva and that of active and control sites in ap subjects.

TI  == systemic antibody responses to oral microorganisms in the cynomolgus monkey: development of methodology and longitudinal responses during ligature-induced disease.
AB  == systemic antibody responses to oral microorganisms were studied during ligature-induced periodontal disease in a non-human primate (nhp) model. methodology was developed using elisa techniques to assess total igg and igm levels in the serum from the nhp. in addition, an elisa was developed utilizing affinity-purified anti-human isotype reagents to detect nhp serum antibody responses to porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. results showed that the anti-human reagents detected igg and igm from macaca fascicularis with an efficiency of 25-35% and 50-60%, respectively. following ligation, groups of nhp  were treated with an immunomodulator ("thymopentin", tp5) or placebo to examine the effect of the t-cell stimulating agent on periodontitis and host responses. no differences were noted in total serum igg and igm levels for individual nhp or between groups when baseline, ligation and treatment intervals were compared. however, following ligation, 8/12 nhp exhibited significant increases in igg and/or igm antibody to p. gingivalis that were coincident with increases in the percentage of this microorganism in the subgingival plaque from the ligated sites. during the treatment phase, the antibody levels in the placebo group continued to increase, while the levels in the tp5-treated group stabilized. the  findings in this study indicate that the emergence of a microorganism in the subgingival plaque (p. gingivalis) during the conversion from gingivitis to progressing periodontitis in the nhp, elicits a systemic antibody response that is specific for the microorganism.

TI  == subgingival microflora of advanced periodontitis in the dominican republic.
AB  == a study of the predominant subgingival microflora was carried out in 24 periodontitis patients, 18 to 60 years of age, in santo domingo, dominican republic. paper point sampling, transport in vmga iii, and conventional microbiological techniques were utilized. direct microscopic examination revealed that cocci and nonmotile organisms made up 85% of the total organisms and spirochetes as little as 3%. nonselective culturing showed gram-negative organisms to constitute 53% of total isolates. fusobacterium nucleatum averaged 15%, black-pigmented anaerobes 7%, and peptostreptococcus micros 10% of the cultivable microflora. enteric rods and acinetobacter species were recovered from 16 patients and comprised 23% of the cultivable flora. enterobacter cloacae occurred in 8 patients, klebsiella oxytoca in 3 patients, and 7 other species in  10 patients. parallel studies have found a significantly lower prevalence of enteric rods in advanced periodontitis patients in the usa. in conclusion, fewer  spirochetes and markedly more enteric rods seem to inhabit adult periodontitis lesions in santo domingo patients compared to those in usa. high levels of subgingival enteric rods in periodontitis patients in santo domingo may have important prophylactic and therapeutic implications.

TI  == studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  == two unique forms of periodontal disease, hiv-gingivitis and hiv-periodontitis, have been described in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). in order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in aids patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 aids patients with periodontitis. the presence of putative periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly b. gingivalis), and wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 aids patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. of 666 bacterial  strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, streptococcus sanguis ii was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), porphyromonas gingivalis  (12%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. enteric species including enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis, clostridium clostridiiforme and clostridium difficle as well as klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. intermedius, and  p. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four  times more periodontitis patients demonstrated w. recta. subgingival yeast was a  frequent finding in these aids patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. this study indicates that subgingival plaque in aids patients with  periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-hiv infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.

AB  == the phagocytic ingestion of clinical isolates and reference strains of bacteroides buccae, bacteroides oris, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium  nucleatum by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns) was studied. special attention was focused on the hydrophobicity of the strains. b. buccae strains, less or equally hydrophobic than pmns, were poorly ingested without opsonization. hydrophobic, but not hydrophilic, strains of b. oris and both hydrophilic and hydrophobic p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum strains were readily ingested without  opsonization. hydrophobicity thus contributes to the adherence of bacteria to pmns in some, but not all, species tested. normal human serum enhanced the ingestion of b. buccae, but failed to do so after heat-inactivation. heat-inactivation of the immune serum to b. buccae strain es57 did not reduce opsonic activity suggesting that specific antibodies enhanced the ingestion of b. buccae.

TI  == the relationship of serum igg antibody titers to periodontal pathogens to indicators of the host response in crevicular fluid.
AB  == in this study; the relationship of indicators of the local host response in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) to the serum antibody titer to periodontal pathogens was examined. 15 patients with chronic adult periodontitis were studied. gcf was collected and analyzed for the total amount of igg, igm, the lysosomal enzyme b-glucuronidase (bg) and alpha-2-macroglobulin (alpha 2m). at the same examination, serum from these patients was collected, and enzyme-linked  immunosorbent assays used to determine the serum igg antibody titer to a panel of 17 periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (3 strains), bacteroides gingivalis (4), eikenella corrodens (2), wolinella recta, bacteroides intermedius (3), fusobacterium nucleatum, and 3 capnocytophaga species). using spearman rank order correlation analysis, correlation coefficients were calculated to relate the 4 indicators of host response in gcf to the serum igg antibody titer to each of the 17 micro-organisms. the mean correlation between total igg in gcf and the serum igg antibody titer was positive (r = +0.30), and statistically significant correlations between total igg in gcf and serum igg antibody titer were observed for one strain of b. intermedius and c. ochracea. a  weaker positive correlation was observed for igm (r = 0.18). in contrast, the mean correlation between total bg in gcf and the serum antibody titer was negative (r = -0.34). statistically significant negative correlations were observed for all 3 strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans, one strain of e. corrodens and w. recta. the mean correlation for alpha 2m was r = -0.06. these data suggest that elevated bg activity in gcf, believed to be a marker for lysosomal enzyme released from polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the crevicular environment, may be associated with a reduced serum igg antibody response to suspected periodontal pathogens. furthermore, these findings imply that the development of a serum igg antibody response to suspected periodontal pathogens is consistent with a protective host response.

TI  == growth stimulation of treponema denticola by periodontal microorganisms.
AB  == previous experiments have indicated that enrichment of subgingival plaque in human serum can lead to the accumulation of treponema denticola. t. denticola depends on bacterial interactions for its growth in serum. aim of the present study was to identify specific microorganisms involved in the growth stimulation  of t. denticola. to this end, strains isolated from previous plaque enrichment cultures were tested for growth stimulation in co-cultures with t. denticola. in  addition, growth of t. denticola was tested in culture filtrates of the same strains, bacteroides intermedius, eubacterium nodatum, veillonella parvula and fusobacterium nucleatum were found to enhance growth of t. denticola in co-cultures. a continuous co-culture of t. denticola, f. nucleatum and b. intermedius in human serum gave very high levels of t. denticola, up to 3.10(9).ml-1. mechanisms involved in growth stimulation may include the ability of b. intermedius and e. nodatum to cleave the protein-core of serum (glyco-)proteins, making these molecules accessible for degradation by t. denticola. in addition, e. nodatum was found to produce a low-molecular weight growth-factor for t. denticola, that was heat-stable and acid as well as alkaline resistant. v. parvula may provide peptidase activities complementary to those of  t. denticola. the nature of the growth enhancing activity of f. nucleatum is yet  unknown. the data support the dependency of t. denticola on other bacterial species for growth in the periodontal pocket.

TI  == capnophilic and anaerobic bacteremia in neutropenic patients: an oral source.
AB  == the currently accepted empiric antibiotic therapy for bacterial infections in neutropenic patients may not cover the possibility of capnophilic and anaerobic bacteremia. many of these infections develop in patients with severe mucositis or periodontitis, and the type of organisms recovered also suggests an oral source of infection. we present two cases of bacteremia in neutropenic patients who had  been empirically treated with ceftazidime and piperacillin plus amikacin. in the  first case a beta-lactamase-producing strain of capnocytophaga ochracea was isolated; in the second case bacteremia was due to a mixture of leptotrichia buccalis and fusobacterium nucleatum. these observations emphasize the necessity  for a reevaluation of the possible use of antimicrobial agents active against beta-lactamase-producing capnophilic organisms and anaerobic bacteria during empiric therapy in neutropenic patients with an oral source of infection.

TI  == role of cryptic receptors (cryptitopes) in bacterial adhesion to oral surfaces.
AB  == progress in characterizing the receptors that promote bacterial attachment to teeth and oral epithelial cells has suggested that hidden molecular segments may  frequently be involved. such cryptic receptors, referred to as 'cryptitopes', may become exposed by several mechanisms. hidden segments of salivary acidic proline-rich proteins evidently become exposed when the molecules undergo a conformational change as they adsorb to apatitic mineral. adhesins of actinomyces viscosus and certain other prominent dental plaque bacteria are able to bind to these cryptitopes, and this enables these organisms to bind to proline-rich proteins on apatitic surfaces while avoiding interactions with these proteins in  solution. cryptitopes may also become exposed as a result of enzymatic action. thus, several bacteria, including fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii and bacteroides intermedius, have adhesins that bind to galactosyl receptors which become exposed after treatment with neuraminidase.  similarly, the adhesion of some gram-negative bacteria, such as bact. gingivalis, is enhanced when tissue surfaces are treated with certain proteases, or lysosomal enzymes derived from human polymorphonuclear leucocytes. it seems likely that elevated levels of enzymes present in gingival fluid as sequelae of poor oral hygiene and gingivitis may generate cryptitopes for potentially periodontopathic  bacteria, and thereby contribute to modulation of the gingival flora.

AB  == the effect of heat-killed periodontopathic bacteria on the production of interleukin-1 (il-1) and an il-1 inhibitor by human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn's) was examined. peripheral blood was obtained from 18 healthy volunteers and the pmn's were separated using dextran sedimentation and ficoll-paque density gradient centrifugation. the pmn's (5 x 10(5) cells/well) were cultured in serum-free media with or without heat-killed periodontopathic bacteria. four gram-negative periodontopathic bacteria were used; bacteroides gingivalis fdc 381, bacteroides forsythus fdc 338, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 and fusobacterium nucleatum fdc 263. the non-oral fusobacterium mortiferum atcc 25557 was used as a control organism. il-1 activity was assayed using thymocyte proliferation. the non-oral organism f. mortiferum stimulated il-1 production by  pmn's, in contrast none of the periodontopathic bacteria stimulated il-1 release  although the bacteria themselves had an il-1 enhancing effect. following fractionation of the periodontopathic bacteria stimulated pmn supernatants, an il-1 inhibitory fraction was identified. these results may illustrate a further mechanism by which periodontopathic bacteria may evade the protective effect of pmn's and may also suggest a regulatory role for pmn's in chronic inflammatory periodontal disease.

TI  == characterization of coaggregation between bacteroides gingivalis t22 and fusobacterium nucleatum t18.
AB  == bacterial adherence is a key factor in the colonization of the oral ecosystem, yet little is known about the mechanisms by which the pathogen bacteroides gingivalis adheres in the periodontal environment. we examined the ability of strains of b. gingivalis to coaggregate with selected microorganisms isolated from the subgingival microbiota of the cynomolgus monkey. a strong interaction was demonstrated between strains of b. gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum, whereas less pronounced or no interaction was observed with other oral isolates.  electron microscopic examination of coaggregates revealed large masses of bacteria, in which the fusiform f. nucleatum t18 and coccobacillary b. gingivalis t22 cells formed a woven pattern. to investigate this interaction and the nature  of the bacterial cell surface molecules involved, we used a microcoaggregation assay. galactose and galactose-related sugars blocked coaggregation, in contrast  with the lack of effect of glucose or glucose-related sugars. the ability of f. nucleatum t18 cells to coaggregate was diminished by pretreatment with pronase. pretreatment of b. gingivalis t22 cells with pronase resulted in an inhibition of coaggregation, whereas pretreatment with sodium metaperiodate completely abolished coaggregation. these data suggest that the coaggregation between b. gingivalis t22 and f. nucleatum t18 represents a carbohydrate-lectin interaction, mediated by a galactose-containing carbohydrate on b. gingivalis t22 and a protein on f. nucleatum t18.

AB  == the coaggregation of fusobacterium nucleatum pk1594 and porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis pk1924 was inhibited equally well by lactose, n-acetyl-d-galactosamine, and d-galactose, which caused 50% inhibition of coaggregation at 2 mm sugar concentration. other sugars such as d-galactosamine,  d-fucose (6-deoxy-d-galactose), and alpha-methyl- and beta-methyl-d-galactosides  also inhibited coaggregation. sugar specificity was apparent, since neither l-fucose, l-rhamnose, n-acetyl-d-glucosamine, nor n-acetylneuraminic acid was an  inhibitor. protease treatment of the fusobacterium completely abolished coaggregation, whereas it had no effect on the coaggregating activity of the porphyromonad. although numerous lactose-inhibitable coaggregating pairs are known to occur among gram-positive bacteria, this report and the accompanying survey (p. e. kolenbrander, r. n. andersen, and l. v. h. moore, infect. immun. 57:3194-3203, 1989) are the first studies demonstrating the extensive nature of this type of interaction between gram-negative human oral bacteria. the significance of galactoside-inhibitable coaggregations between these two potential periodontal pathogens is discussed.

TI  == influence of age and immunization on development of gingivitis in rats.
AB  == to study the effect of age and antigenic priming on the development of gingivitis, 33 healthy rats were placed in contact with streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and bacteroides gingivalis. on days 0, 3, 7, and 14 after inoculation, the gingival condition was judged clinically and histologically, and serum antibody titers against the bacteria were measured. the rats were divided into three groups: 1 month old, 3 months old, and 3 months old immunized. none of the young rats developed gingivitis during the experiment, whereas half of the adult and all of the adult immunized rats bled on probing on days 7 and 14. in general, antibody titers against the bacteria were low in young rats, moderate in adult rats, and high in adult immunized rats. these results indicate that adult rats react stronger to plaque antigens than young rats and that previous contact with the antigens increases the reaction.

TI  == the effect of subminimal inhibitory concentrations of antimicrobial agents on three bacterial mixtures.
AB  == a test tube technique was developed to screen bacterial mixtures to detect interbacterial interactions that play a role in determining sensitivity to antimicrobial agents. we found 3 mixtures where these bacterial interactions change the sensitivity to antimicrobials or change the proportions of each bacterial species in the mixture. the mixtures were: fusobacterium nucleatum 102.3 and bacteroides endodontalis atcc 35406; f. nucleatum 102.3 and b. endodontalis bn11 a-f; and capnocytophaga ochracea 1956c and eubacterium saburreum 162.4. the antimicrobials used were metronidazole for the first 2 mixtures and tetracycline for the last. f. nucleatum seems to protect b. endodontalis from the action of metronidazole. conversely, the growth inhibition  of c. ochracea by e. saburreum was lifted when tetracycline was present. we also  found that the growth of c. ochracea can then permit the subsequent growth of e.  saburreum. the test tube method permits the evaluation both of interbacterial interactions and the detection of any protective mechanism against antimicrobial  agents in a bacterial mixture. we found that f. nucleatum 102.3 can decrease the  metronidazole level in the culture medium, and by the use of 14c-metronidazole we demonstrated that acetamide is produced from metronidazole.

TI  == [microbiological and serological investigation of periodontal disease activity].
AB  == if disease activity in periodontal disease can be determined, the therapeutic measures of periodontitis may become diverse and different from patient to patient. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the usefulness of microbiological and serological examination of periodontopathic bacteria in detecting destructive periodontal disease activity. one hundred and forty-eight sites in 52 subjects with moderate to severe periodontitis were studied clinically. clinical parameters included plaque index, gingival index, probing depth, bleeding on probing and percent bone loss as measured radiographically. subgingival plaque of whole sites was investigated microbiologically by means of  indirect fluorescent-antibody technique with rabbit antibodies against actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (2 serotypes), eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides gingivalis and bacteroides intermedius. the levels of serum igg antibody to these organisms were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with whole cell preparations. thirty-two of 52 subjects were instructed in oral hygiene and received several sessions of scaling and root planing. the clinical, bacteriological and serological assessments were also performed after periodontal therapy. active disease site was defined as the site of which clinical status did not be improved even after periodontal treatment. b. gingivalis, b. intermedius and a. viscosus were detected in 80% of periodontal lesions, and the proportion of b. gingivalis  was the highest among six bacterial species tested. a. actinomycetemcomitans, e.  corrodens and f. nucleatum were found only occasionally and in low numbers. the proportion of b. gingivalis was higher in severely inflamed sites than in clinically healthy sites. b. gingivalis and b. intermedius are rarely found in treated periodontitis sites, while the proportion of a. viscosus was slightly increased after treatment. sera of the pre-treatment patients demonstrated significantly higher antibody levels to b. gingivalis and significantly lower levels to a. viscosus than those of healthy persons. antibody levels reactive with other four species in the patients did not significantly differ from the levels in healthy persons. after periodontal therapy, antibody levels to b. gingivalis, b. intermedius and a. actinomycetemcomitans (serotype a) significantly decreased and the levels to a. viscosus increased to a slight degree. b. gingivalis was found more frequently in disease-active sites than in disease-inactive sites. the proportions of other bacterial species in disease-active sites did not differ from those in disease-inactive sites. the results of the present investigation suggest that monitoring b. gingivalis in subgingival plaque and serum igg antibody titer against this organism may aid in  the description and adequate treatment of the periodontal disease.

TI  == humoral immune response to selected subgingival plaque microorganisms in insulin-dependent diabetic children.
AB  == juvenile diabetics have been shown to have an increased susceptibility to gingivitis and periodontitis following puberty. however, little data are available on changes in the microbial flora that occur at the onset of puberty. this study was performed to determine if antibacterial antibody titers to selected periodontal disease-associated microorganisms might be helpful in revealing changes in plaque flora at the onset and conclusion of puberty. sera was obtained from 35 subjects (ages 7 to 18 years) selected from a population of  insulin-dependent diabetics. the subjects were given a thorough medical examination which included an assessment of sexual maturation and a dental examination which included the recording of onset and magnitude of bleeding according to the papillary bleeding score. antibody titers to a. naeslundii (an), b. intermedius (bi), b. gingivalis (bg), f. nucleatum (fn), a. actinomycetemcomitans (aa), c. ochracea (co) and t. denticola (td) were determined using the microelisa. stratification of antibody titers by age groups  (less than or equal to 12 years, 12 to 15 years, greater than 15 years) revealed  that titers to an increased significantly (p less than 0.025, anova) and progressively (p less than 0.05, regression analysis) with increasing age. in contrast, the titers to fn were maximal in the under 12 year group and decreased  with age (anova, p less than 0.05; regression analysis, p less than 0.05). there  were no significant variations in titers observed for the other microorganisms. stratification by sexual maturity revealed a similar progressive decrease of the  titer to fn (anova, p less than 0.05; regression analysis, p less than 0.005).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == relationship of subgingival plaque flora to lysosomal and cytoplasmic enzyme activity in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == examining the relationships among indicators of the acute inflammatory response in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) and specific bacterial species in subgingival  plaque may provide indications of which bacterial species or groups of species may be associated with potentially destructive host-derived processes. here we report on the relationship of the subgingival plaque flora to the activity of mammalian forms of the enzymes beta-glucuronidase (beta g), lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), and arylsulfatase (as) in gcf from a total of 54 4-6 mm periodontal sites  from 13 periodontitis patients. sites were scored for probing depth (pd) and bleeding on probing, and gcf was collected using filter paper strips inserted into the sulcus for 30 s, eluted in buffer and assayed for enzyme activity. 1 week later, the patients were again evaluated for pd and bleeding, and subgingival plaque was removed with a curette oriented toward the pocket epithelium. plaque samples were examined by darkfield microscopy and cultured anaerobically on selective and non-selective media. various groups of bacteria, including species of black pigmenting bacteroides (bpb), fusobacterium sp., capnocytophaga sp, streptococcus sanguis, and total facultative organisms were enumerated. relationships among the enzymes and bacterial groups expressed as colony-forming unit (cfu) counts or as a % of the total cultivable flora were assessed by spearman correlation analysis. beta g levels were significantly correlated with populations of spirochetes, b. intermedius, b. gingivalis, and total lactose negative bpb's. correlation between beta g and f. nucleatum sp. or  capnocytophaga sp. approached but did not reach statistically significant levels. in contrast, ldh activity showed a significant positive correlation with levels of b. gingivalis and total lactose negative bpb's. as levels were significantly correlated only with b. gingivalis. beta g and ldh showed a significant negative  correlation with levels of coccoid forms. thus, beta g, an acid hydrolase which can serve as a marker for primary granule release from polymorphonuclear leukocytes, was most closely correlated with the micro-organisms found in other studies to be associated with chronic adult periodontitis.

TI  == interleukin-1 and interleukin-1 inhibitor production by human adherent cells stimulated with periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == this study examined the effect of the putative periodontopathic bacteria bacteroides gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum on the production of interleukin-1 (il-1) and il-1 inhibitors by human plastic-adherent mononuclear cells from normal donors. fusobacterium mortiferum was used as a non-oral, non-pathogenic control organism. unstimulated adherent cells spontaneously secreted an il-1 inhibitor, whereas stimulation with b. gingivalis induced the synthesis and secretion of il-1. with both fusobacteria il-1 was present in the intracellular environment, whereas the predominant secretory product was either il-1 or an il-1 inhibitor. these results suggest that bacteria are capable of modulating cytokine production by monocytes and may thereby alter the local immune response.

TI  == an in vitro model to study bacterial invasion of periodontal tissues.
AB  == in periodontal disease, the abilities of bacteria to adhere to and degrade in vivo basement membranes should be considered as two of the rate-limiting steps for the potential active or passive invasion of gingival connective tissues. to study these mechanisms in greater detail, we used the pf hr-9 basement-membrane-like matrix to establish an in vitro model of bacterial invasion and degradation. three gram-negative anaerobic periodontopathic organisms, bacteroides gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bound in considerably higher numbers to the hr-9 matrix than did 6 strains of gram-positive facultative organisms typically associated with periodontal health. in a further experiment with b. gingivalis, the organism rapidly degraded type iv collagen, the major macromolecular component constituting the hr-9 matrix. streptococcus mitis, the nonperiodontopathic bacterium tested, did not degrade this model matrix. this study provides evidence that b. gingivalis, a periodontopathic bacterium, is able to adhere to and degrade basement membranes, whereas nonperiodontopathic organisms appear not to share in these abilities.

TI  == attachment of oral bacteria to a basement-membrane-like matrix and to purified matrix proteins.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the adherence of oral bacteria to an in vitro basement-membrane-like matrix and to selected individual macromolecular  constituents of this matrix. radiolabeled bacteria were incubated with basement-membrane-like matrices isolated from pf hr-9 cells. bacteroides gingivalis 33277, fusobacterium nucleatum fn-2, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ga3(a) bound to the matrix in the range of 44 to 70%, considerably higher than the ranges of a. actinomycetemcomitans ga3(na) and suny  ab67 (range, 20 to 25%). the attachment of selected strains of gram-positive bacteria such as streptococcus and actinomyces spp. was much less frequent (range, 6 to 25%). competitive inhibition studies demonstrated that preincubating the bacteria with fibronectin significantly decreased the binding of b. gingivalis by 51% but increased the binding of other gram-negative and gram-positive organisms tested. similarly, preincubating the matrices with antifibronectin antibodies decreased the binding of b. gingivalis by 31%, whereas the other bacteria tested were either unaffected or binding was increased. the adherence of bacteria to purified basement membrane proteins was also investigated. strain and species differences were seen in binding, but no clear relationship emerged between binding to an intact matrix and binding to isolated  matrix proteins. the results of this study suggest that some gram-negative oral bacteria commonly associated with periodontal disease, such as b. gingivalis, a.  actinomycetemcomitans, and f. nucleatum, bound in high numbers to basement-membrane-like matrices in vitro. on the other hand, the gram-positive strains tested bound in much fewer numbers. the results suggest that further studies with this in vitro model may aid in understanding the mechanisms by which oral bacteria adhere to basement membranes.

TI  == a mixed-culture chemostat system to predict the effect of anti-microbial agents on the oral flora: preliminary studies using chlorhexidine.
AB  == a mixed-culture chemostat system, composed of nine bacterial species representative of plaque in health and disease, has been assessed as an improved  laboratory method of evaluating the likely in vivo effects of antimicrobial agents used in dentistry. the advantages of the system include reproducibility, the long-term stable cultivation of bacteria under controllable conditions, and repeated sampling, for bacteriological and biochemical studies, without disrupting the stability of the community. the effects of (i) the continuous provision of chlorhexidine (chx) and (ii) three pulses of chx (final concentration in both experiments = 0.24 mmol/l) on the composition of the chemostat communities were monitored. only l. casei survived the continuous provision of chx; the other bacteria were killed and were lost at different rates which generally corresponded to their known sensitivities to chx. after each chx  pulse, the numbers of bacteria fell markedly. again, l. casei was least affected, while a. viscosus, b. intermedius, and f. nucleatum were temporarily undetectable but returned to their original levels within 2-4 generation times. counts of s. mutans were affected more by chx than those of s. sanguis or s. mitior. the effect of successive pulses of chx on the viability of some bacteria and on acid  production (as measured by ph-fall experiments) decreased, suggesting that adaptation to chx had occurred. the fact that the in vitro observations paralleled previous clinical findings suggests that the mixed-culture system could be used as a predictive model of the probable effect on the oral flora of new anti-microbial agents prior to expensive trials in animals or human volunteers.

TI  == suspected periodontopathic microorganisms and their oral habitats in young children.
AB  == samples of subgingival plaque from 67 children, 5-7 years of age, were examined for the presence of certain suspected periodontal pathogenic species using the conventional technique of anaerobic sonification, dilution and spiral plating. when this technique was compared with a direct plating procedure which involved no preliminary dispersion and dilution of plaque specimens, it was found that the direct method resulted in double the frequency of children in whom black-pigmented bacteroides (bpb) were detected and a 10-times increase in the number of subjects harbouring actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. samples from  the tongue, tonsils and saliva were also plated using the direct technique. bpb were detected less commonly in the plaque specimens (61.3% of children) than in saliva (89.5%), or on the tongue (86.6%) and tonsils (97.1%). expressed as percentages of a pooled sample of the total bpb population, the most frequently detected species in plaque were bacteroides intermedius (44.4%) and bacteroides melaninogenicus (48.0%). the most prevalent isolate in all other oral sites was b. melaninogenicus. expressed as percentages of children in whom bpb were detected, the most frequently isolated species from plaque using the conventional dilution technique was b. intermedius (21.3%), whereas other bpb species were present in fewer than 5% of children. fusobacterium nucleatum and capnocytophaga  species were isolated most frequently from plaque but were also commonly detected in the various other oral sites.

TI  == structural determinants of activity of chlorhexidine and alkyl bisbiguanides against the human oral flora.
AB  == we assayed chlorhexidine and a series of its analogues, in which the chlorophenyl terminal substituents were replaced with alkyl chains, for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against the gram-negative and gram-positive oral bacteria. changes in antimicrobial activity were correlated with changes in agent structure for identification of structural criteria which may be important in the optimization of agent activity. chlorhexidine showed substantial antimicrobial activity against the gram-negative as well as the gram-positive oral bacteria. the alkyl agents were comparable with chlorhexidine in their activity against bacteroides gingivalis and bacteroides intermedius, black-pigmented gram-negative obligate anaerobes associated with periodontal disease in adults. alkyl agents alexidine, heptihexidine (1,6-bis-n-heptylbiguanidohexane), hexoctidine (1,8-bis-n-hexylbiguanidoctane), and hexhexidine (1,6-bis-n-hexylbiguanidohexane), as well as chlorhexidine, were active against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, a gram-negative organism associated with localized juvenile periodontitis. hexidecidine (1,10-bis-n-hexylbiguanidodecane)  and heptoctidine (1,8-bis-n-heptylbiguanidooctane) were more active, and hexhexidine was as active as chlorhexidine against fusobacterium nucleatum, also  associated with periodontal disease. seven of the agents were more active than chlorhexidine against actinomyces species. all test agents were active against streptococcus mutans, a gram-positive coccus associated with dental caries. hexidecidine had activity equal to that of chlorhexidine when evaluated against the entire battery of organisms. analysis of structure-activity relationships revealed that alkyl chains could replace chlorophenyl groups with retention or improvement of antimicrobial activity.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the establishment of reproducible, complex communities of oral bacteria in the chemostat using defined inocula.
AB  == nine commonly isolated oral bacterial populations were inoculated into a glucose-limited and a glucose-excess (amino acid-limited) chemostat maintained at a constant ph 7.0 and a mean community generation time of 13.9 h. the bacterial populations were streptococcus mutans atcc 2-27351, strep. sanguis nctc 7865, strep. mitior ef 186, actinomyces viscosus wvu 627, lactobacillus casei ac 413, neisseria sp. a1078, veillonella alkalescens atcc 17745, bacteroides intermedius  t 588 and fusobacterium nucleatum nctc 10593. all nine populations became established in the glucose-limited chemostat although strep. sanguis and neisseria sp. were present only after a second and third inoculation, respectively. in contrast, even following repeated inoculations, strep. mutans, b. intermedius and neisseria sp. could not be maintained under glucose-excess conditions. a more extensive pattern of fermentation products and amino acid catabolism occurred under glucose-limited growth; this simultaneous utilization of mixed substrates also contributed to the higher yields (y molar glucose) and greater species diversity of these communities. microscopic and biochemical evidence suggested that cell-to-cell interactions and food chains were occurring  among community members. to compare the reproductibility of this system, communities were established on three occasions under glucose-limitation and twice under glucose-excess conditions. the bacterial composition of the steady-state communities and their metabolic behaviour were similar when grown under identical conditions but varied in a consistent manner according to the nutrient responsible for limiting growth. although a direct simulation of the oral cavity was not attempted, the results show that the chemostat could be used  as an environmentally-related model to grow complex but reproducible communities  of oral bacteria for long periods from a defined inoculum.

AB  == the microbial ecology of adherent plaque was investigated in relation to the pathological findings of gingivitis in plaque-susceptible rats. plaque developed  in the gingiva of the lower incisor in plaque-susceptible rats, but not in plaque-resistant rats, after they were fed a commercial powder diet. with increase in plaque volume, the total counts of bacteria increased 10(9) to 10(11)/g. in the first 3 months, bacteroides species increased and became the predominant population. streptococcus species also increased at the same time. after 9 months, fusobacterium species and oral treponema species were recognized  in increasing numbers. the anaerobic bacteria increased in proportion with the progression of plaque development. bacteroides intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus salivarius, and other species were isolated. acute gingivitis was observed within 3 months, and subacute-chronic gingivitis was observed between 2 and 12 months. these findings suggest that proportional changes in the gingival plaque flora may uniquely contribute to the development of gingival inflammation in this experimental model.

TI  == serum antibody reactive with predominant organisms in the subgingival flora of young adults with generalized severe periodontitis.
AB  == in the present study we sought to determine whether serum antibody was present against microorganisms which predominate in the subgingival flora of young adults with generalized severe periodontitis (sp). subjects with sp were often seropositive for eubacterium brachy, fusobacterium nucleatum e3c22, and peptostreptococcus micros, whereas subjects with juvenile periodontitis (jp) and  subjects with healthy periodontium (hp) were not. both sp and jp subjects were more frequently seropositive for bacteroides gingivalis, f. nucleatum d52b16, and f. nucleatum e1d1 than were hp subjects. the data were most striking for b. gingivalis, for which both the incidence and the magnitude of specific antibody was clearly elevated for sp and jp subject groups. however, sp subjects generally had either a high antibody titer or no detectable titer. in contrast, jp and hp subjects generally had at least very small amounts of antibody. except at very low levels of antibody, neither sp nor jp groups differed significantly from the  hp group for antibody to eubacterium nodatum, bacteroides intermedius (homology group 4197 or 8944), or lactobacillus minutus antibody. there was a high frequency of antibody to e. nodatum, with very high titers in all groups despite  the fact that this organism is rarely found in hp subjects. for eubacterium timidum, the jp group was clearly more frequently seropositive than the hp group. despite high levels of l. minutus in subgingival flora, none of the 50 sp subjects had a detectable antibody titer, and only four of the hp and jp subjects had detectable antibody. these results indicate that many organisms in the subgingival flora elicit antibody responses. b. gingivalis is probably the best example among the species tested. however, some organisms that are present in high concentration, e.g., l. minutus, apparently fail to induce significant antibody responses.

TI  == adhesion of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria to mucosal surfaces.
AB  == fusobacterium nucleatum and black-pigmented bacteroides species adhere to red blood cells and crevicular epithelium. the attachment of the bacteroides, but not f. nucleatum, is associated with the presence of fimbriae-like structures on the  bacterial surface. such structures have been observed also in unencapsulated bacteroides fragilis able to adhere to human red cells and cheek epithelium. encapsulated b. fragilis adheres to porcine brush borders, but the number of adhering cells per brush border fragment is low.

TI  == immunoglobulin g response to subgingival gram-negative bacteria in human subjects.
AB  == serum and gingival crevicular fluid from normal healthy adults and patients with  periodontitis were screened for immunoglobulin g antibodies to antigens from bacteroides gingivalis 381, bacteroides intermedius 24, bacteroides loescheii atcc 15930, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586, eikenella corrodens 1073, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans atcc 29522, and capnocytophaga sp. strain m-12. immunoglobulin g antibody titers to the antigens were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the antibody levels to b. gingivalis in serum  and gingival crevicular fluid were significantly higher in the samples from patients with periodontitis than in samples from healthy individuals. although there were individual differences within patient groups, a positive correlation (p less than 0.01) was found between the serum immunoglobulin g levels to b. gingivalis and the development of periodontitis. the antibodies to f. nucleatum (p less than 0.05), e. corrodens (p less than 0.05), and a. actinomycetemcomitans were slightly higher in patients with periodontitis than in normal subjects. there were no remarkable differences between the two groups in titers to b. intermedius, b. loescheii, and capnocytophaga sp.

TI  == role of anaerobic bacteria in bite-wound infections.
AB  == the etiologic agents usually involved in wound infections due to human or animal  bites are the aerobic skin flora of the victim, e.g., staphylococcus aureus, and/or the aerobic oral flora of the biter, e.g., pasteurella multocida. while anaerobic bacteria are predominant in the normal oral flora of humans and animals, their importance in the pathogenesis of bite-wound infections has not been stressed. most investigators in this field have either not cultured these wounds for anaerobic bacteria or not utilized optimal culture techniques. in a series of studies on human and animal bite wounds, methods that are optimal for recovery of anaerobic bacteria were used. anaerobes were found in significant quantities in 39% of animal bite wounds, 50% of human bite wounds, and 56% of clenched-fist injuries. several species of anaerobes usually were present in the  wounds and always were present in mixed culture with aerobic oral flora. the anaerobes most commonly isolated included bacteroides asaccharolyticus, bacteroides bivius, bacteroides disiens, bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides oralis, bacteroides ruminicola, bacteroides pneumosintes, bacteroides ureolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium russii, peptococcus species,  peptostreptococcus species, and veillonella species. initial, empiric antimicrobial therapy for bite wounds should be directed against potential anaerobic as well as aerobic pathogens.

TI  == [proportion and frequency of 3 kinds of anaerobic bacteria in relation to the gingival index].
AB  == the proportion and frequency of three groups of particular bacteria (bacteroides, fusobacterium and spirochetes) were studied in relation to the gingival index on  the sites from which they were sampled. seventy eight samples collected from 40 individuals were studied together with measurements of the gingival index and the pocket or sulcus depth. the samples were dispersed by ultrasonic treatment, diluted and cultured on a non-selective medium. the identification of the species was done by biochemical tests and by analysis of the metabolic products with gas  chromatography. as a whole, our results support the hypothesis of an important change in the microbial flora from a clinical healthy status (with predominant gram positive facultative anaerobic bacteria) to disease (with predominant gram negative strict anaerobic bacteria). furthermore the results suggest that bacteroides gingvalis as well as fusobacterium nucleatum and spirochetes through  their high frequency and important proportion at the affected sites played an etiological role in the pathogenesis of gingivitis and periodontis man.

TI  == haemolysis of human erythrocytes by the fusobacterium nucleatum associated with periodontal disease.
AB  == fusobacterium nucleatum and bacteroides gingivalis are associated with oral disease. they both attach to haemagglutinate and human erythrocytes. experiments  were performed to determine whether haemolysis would occur following attachment of strains of f. nucleatum and bacteroides species including b. gingivalis. the f. nucleatum strains consistently displayed both haemagglutination and haemolytic activity. the b. gingivalis strains and other bacteroides species displayed haemagglutination but no measurable haemolytic activity. varying the concentration of the f. nucleatum whole cells in the standard haemolysis assay suggested a f. nucleatum-erythrocyte binding site interaction. the haemolytic moiety was observed in various cell, cell wall and lipopolysaccharide extracts.

TI  == humoral immune response to oral microorganisms in periodontitis.
AB  == serum antibody titers from patients with periodontitis were compared with those from periodontally healthy subjects. with the micro-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunoglobulin g (igg), iga, and igm antibody titers to isolates of streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides  melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius, bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius, bacteroides ochraceus, and fusobacterium nucleation were determined. antibody titers of the igg and iga classes to b. melaninogenicus, b. ochraceus, f. nucleatum, and s. sanguis were found to be significantly higher in the controls than in the patients. no correlations were found with serum igm titers. these findings indicate that periodonitis may be associated with depressed antibacterial serum antibody titers of the igg and iga  classes.

TI  == plasmid content of some oral microorganisms isolated from subgingival plaque.
AB  == eighty-five strains of bacterial species selected from the predominant cultivable dental plaque flora of patients with different periodontal pathologies were examined for their plasmid content. microorganisms studied included: actinomyces  viscosus, a. odontolyticus, bacteroides asaccharolyticus (b. gingivalis), b. melaninogenicus subspecies intermedius, and subspecies melaninogenicus, capnocytophaga ochracea (b. ochraceus), and fusobacterium nucleatum. three b. melaninogenicus isolates showed plasmids of approximately 2.7-2.9 mdalton (mega-dalton) molecular size. restriction enzyme digests of the plasmids demonstrated dissimilar patterns when electrophoresed on agarose gels. in other microorganisms, including the actinomyces species, plasmids were not observed.

TI  == the predominant cultivable dental plaque flora of beagle dogs with periodontitis.
AB  == the predominant cultivable dental plaque flora was studied in 10 adult female beagle dogs with advanced periodontitis. supragingival and subgingival plaque from a maxillary third premolar (p3) was removed and cultured anaerobically on various growth media and all colonies were subcultured and partially characterized. histopathological specimens of the plaque sampling sites showed significant loss of connective tissue attachment. spirochetes were found in all samples. anaerobic gram-negative organisms were predominant in both types of plaque accounting for about 55% of the cultivable organisms in the supragingival  plaque and almost 75% in the subgingival plaque. bacteroides asaccharolyticus was the most predominant organism in the supragingival plaque, whereas fusobacterium  nucleatum predominated in the subgingival flora. streptococcal and actinomycotic  species were common in the supragingival plaque, but their proportions, especially those of the actinomycetes, were decreased in the subgingival flora. in many respects the bacterial profile associated with disease resembled that reported in human periodontal disease.

TI  == microbial surface interactions: reduction of the haemagglutination activity of the oral bacterium fusobacterium nucleatum by absorption with streptococcus and bacteroides.
AB  == oral strains of fusobacterium nucleatum showed haemagglutination (ha) of sheep red blood cells and attachment of ha-active f. nucleatum fragments to other microorganisms allowed a means of studying microbial surface interactions. ha-active sonicated fragments (sf) prepared from f. nucleatum were mixed with whole cell suspensions of 48 bacterial strains and, after incubation, the whole cells were separated from the non-absorbed fragments by differential centrifugation. attachment of f. nucleatum fragments to the cells was indicated by a reduction in the ha activity of the sf in the supernatant fluid remaining after absorption with whole cells. ha activity of the microbial cells used for absorption and the detection of f. nucleatum fragments on these cells by an indirect fluorescent antibody technique provided further evidence of attachment.  of the 48 strains tested, 10 absorbed f. nucleatum ha-active fragments. they included bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides fragilis subsp. distasonis, bacteroides corrodens, streptococcus morbillorum, streptococcus sanguis (blackburn and jc 74) and streptococcus mutans aht, bht, 10449 and 6715. chelators revealed that f. nucleatum attached to the microorganisms via a ca2+-dependent interaction. sugar inhibition demonstrated that f. nucleatum attached to the microorganisms via a d-galactose-containing moiety on their surface. a reduction in the absorption of f. nucleatum ha-active fragments by strep. mutans grown in a higher concentration of sucrose was observed.

TI  == modulation of immunoreactivity to periodontal disease-associated microorganisms during pregnancy.
AB  == the lymphocyte blastogenic response to a panel of antigens and mitogens was assessed in a group of 20 women throughout their pregnancy. in addition, a group  of five nonpregnant women was monitored simultaneously to identify variations in  response to the same stimulants. the stimulants included orally associated bacterial antigens (streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, bacteroides asaccharolyticus, bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius, bacteroides [capnocytophaga] ochraceus, and fusobacterium nucleatum) and non-orally associated-stimulants (streptokinase-streptodornase, tetanus toxoid, concanavalin a, phytohemagglutinin, and pokeweed mitogen). intrinsic (cells cultured in male ab plasma) suppression of the lymphocyte response to these stimulants was observed to occur by the second trmester of pregnancy and was resolved after parturition. additionally, an extrinsic (cells cultured in autologous plasma) suppression was also suggested to occur in a similar manner. there was no detectable enhancement of the blastogenic response to oral bacteria associated with elevated gingivitis, which is generally reported to occur during nonpregnancy gingivitis. we propose that concomitant immunosuppression occurs during the second trimester, which masks such enhancement.

TI  == immune response in rats against lipopolysaccharides of fusobacterium nucleatum and bacteroides oralis administered in the root canal.
AB  == lipopolysaccharides (lps) prepared from one strain of fusobacterium nucleatum and one strain of bacteroides oralis were examined for immunological responses in rats. the lps were applied to the pulp chamber of the two mandibular incisors. using the plaque forming cell (pfc) method both antigens showed a rapid igm response in the spleen, and a slower one in the submandibular lymph nodes. in comparison with the igm response, the igg response was somewhat slower and weaker for lps of bacteroides, while for lps of fusobacterium it was hardly detectable.  after about 3 weeks both antigens gave a significant antibody titer in serum. the results showed that locally applied antigens of oral microorganisms can stimulate to an immune response both in the lymph nodes and the spleen resulting in circulating antibodies. the nature of this response is dependent on the chemical  characteristics of the lps-antigen.

TI  == capnocytophaga: new genus of gram-negative gliding bacteria. iii. physiological characterization.
AB  == sixty-eight strains of capnophilic fusiform gram-negative rods from the human oral cavity were subjected to extensive physiologic characterization, tested for  susceptibility to various antibiotics, and the mol-percent guanine plus cytosine  of each isolate determined. the characteristics of the isolates were compared with 10 fresh and 2 stock isolates of fusobacterium nucleatum. the isolates clearly differed from the fusobacterium species on the basis of mol-percent guanine plus cytosine, end products, growth in a capnophilic environment and fermentation of carbohydrates. all of the gliding isolates required co2 and formed acetate and succinate, but not h2s, indole or acetylmethylcarbinol. all fermented glucose, sucrose, maltose and mannose. the organisms may be differentiated on the basis of fermentation of additional carbohydrates, hydrolysis of polymers and reduction nitrate. three species are proposed: capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena and capnocytophaga gingivalis.  ten isolates did not fit into the proposed species.

TI  == gliding motility and actinomycin d sensitivity of fusobacterium nucleatum and other gram-negative rods.
AB  == six strains of gram-negative anaerobic fusiform rods (fusobacterium and bacteroides spp.), isolated from deep subgingival locations in humans, were examined for (i) gliding motility in slide cultures, (iii) cell densities on nutrient agar surfaces, and (iii) sensitivity to actinomycin d. known gliding (fbt) and nonmotile (nm) strains of myxococcus xanthus served as controls for the gliding and cell density experiments. in the present study, three strains of gram-negative fusiforms from the oral cavity, identified as fusobacterium nucleatum (1a and p-1) and bacteroides sp. (p-14), demonstrated characteristics similar to the gliding control strain m. xanthus. the only gliding oral strain sensitive to actinomycin d was a bacteroides sp. (p-14).

TI  == endotoxic activities of lipopolysaccharides of microorganisms isolated from an infected root canal in macaca cynomolgus.
AB  == lipopolysaccharides (lps) prepared from a strain of bacteroides oralis, a strain  of fusobacterium necrophorum, and a strain of f. nucleatum, all isolated from an  infected root canal in monkey (macaca cynomolgus), were examined for endotoxic activities using primary skin reactions in rabbits and induction of leukocyte chemotaxis in rats. lps of b. oralis showed considerably lower ability to cause skin inflammation than lps of the fusobacteria. however, the leukotactic effect of the lps preparations as determined by the wound chamber method in rats was approximately of the same proportion. in both tests the reactions were compared with those of commercial lps of salmonella typhi. this study shows that endotoxic lps can be isolated from oral gram-negative bacteria, which have infected the root canal. therefore lps may play a role in the development and maintenance of chronic inflammation of the periapical tissues.

TI  == oxygen sensitivity of various anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == anaerobes differ in their sensitivity to oxygen, as two patterns were recognizable in the organisms included in this study. strict anaerobes were species incapable of agar surface growth at po(2) levels greater than 0.5%. species that were found to be strict anaerobes were treponema macrodentium, treponema denticola, treponema oralis n. sp., clostridium haemolyticum, selenomonas ruminatium, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, and lachnospira multiparus. moderate anaerobes would include those species capable of growth in the presence of oxygen levels as high as 2 to 8%. the moderate anaerobes could be exposed to room atmosphere for 60 to 90 min without appreciable loss of viability. species considered as moderate anaerobes were bacteroides fragilis, b. melaninogenicus, b. oralis, fusobacteria nucleatum, clostridium novyi type a, and peptostreptococcus elsdenii. the recognition of at  least two general types of anaerobes would seem to have practical import in regard to the primary isolation of anaerobes from source material.
