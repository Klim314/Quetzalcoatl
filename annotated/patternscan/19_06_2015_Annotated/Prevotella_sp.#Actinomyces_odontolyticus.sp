TI  == antibacterial activity of medicinal plant extracts against periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == this study was performed to evaluate the antibacterial activity of althaea officinalis l. roots, arnica montana l. flowers, calendula officinalis l. flowers, hamamelis virginiana l. leaves, illicium verum hook. fruits and melissa  officinalis l. leaves, against anaerobic and facultative aerobic periodontal bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, veilonella parvula, eikenella corrodens, peptostreptococcus micros and actinomyces odontolyticus. the methanol extracts of h. virginiana and a. montana and, to a lesser extent, a. officinalis were shown to possess an inhibiting activity (mic < or = 2048 mg/l) against many of the species tested. in comparison, m. officinalis and c. officinalis extracts had a lower inhibiting activity (mic > or = 2048 mg/l) against all the tested species with the exception of prevotella sp. illicium verum methanol extract was not very active though it had a particular good activity against e. corrodens. the results suggest the use of the alcohol extracts of h. virginiana, a. montana and a. officinalis for topical medications in periodontal prophylactics.

TI  == antibacterial activity and post-antibiotic effect of flurithromycin compared with other macrolides and penicillins against periodontal pathogens.
AB  == in this study the authors examined the activity of flurithromycin compared to that of erythromycin, spiramycin and penicillin against 107 strains of various species supposed to cause periodontitis. the range of mics of flurithromycin was: < or =0.06-2 mg/l for p. gingivalis (28 isolates), 0.06-2 mg/l for p. melaninogenica (7), 0.5-4 mg/l for p. intermedia (5), 0.25-8 mg/l for prevotella  sp. (8), 1-16 mg/l for f. nucleatum (14), 0.12-0.5 mg/l for w. recta (2), 0.5-32  mg/l for e. corrodens, 0.5-2 mg/l for b. forsythus (2); < or =0.06-64 mg/l for peptostreptococcus sp. (11), < or =0.06-1 mg/l for a. odontolyticus (11) and for  a. naeslundii (7) and < or =0.06-16 mg/l for a. viscosus (7). macrolide activity  was ranked in decreasing order from flurithromycin to erythromycin to spiramycin. beta-lactamase production was demonstrated in prevotella sp. (20%) and in f. nucleatum (7%). isolates which were beta-lactamase negative but resistant to penicillin were found among peptostreptococcus sp. and actinomyces sp. a post-antibiotic effect of 2 hours was seen for flurithromycin on p. gingivalis and e. corrodens. the good in vitro activity of flurithromycin against bacteria supposed to cause periodontitis suggests clinical potential in the treatment of these diseases.

TI  == microbial analysis of bone collected during implant surgery: a clinical and laboratory study.
AB  == dental implant surgery produces bone debris which can be used to correct bone defects in the "simultaneous-augmentation" technique. however, this debris is potentially contaminated with oral bacteria. therefore, this study examined bone  debris collected during dental implant surgery in order 1) to identify the microbial contaminants and 2) to compare the effects of two different aspiration  protocols on the levels of microbial contamination. twenty-four partially dentate patients were randomly allocated into two equal groups and underwent bone collection using the frios bone collector during surgery to insert two endosseous dental implants. in group s (using a stringent aspiration protocol), bone collection occurred within the surgical site only. in group ns (utilizing a non-stringent aspiration protocol), bone collection and tissue fluid control was  achieved using the same suction tip. bone samples were immediately transported for microbial analysis. colonial and microscopic morphology, gaseous requirements and identification kits were utilized for identification of the isolated microbes. twenty-eight species were identified including a number associated with disease, in particular, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus epidermidis as well as the anaerobes actinomyces odontolyticus, eubacterium sp., prevotella intermedia, propionibacterium propionicum and peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. in group s (stringent aspiration protocol), significantly fewer organisms were found than in group ns, the non-stringent aspiration protocol (p=0.001). gram-positive cocci dominated the isolates from both groups. it is concluded that if bone debris is collected for implantation around dental implants, it should be collected with a stringent aspiration protocol (within the surgical site only) to minimize bacterial contaminants.
