TI  == prevotella massiliensis sp. nov. isolated from human blood.
AB  == we report a bacterial isolate (marseille isolate) recovered from the blood of a patient hospitalized in an intensive care unit, presenting with severe trauma, fever and mechanical ventilation. colonies appeared at 37 degrees c on blood agar after 72 h incubation. this isolate was a strictly anaerobic, gram-negative rod phenotypically related to other prevotella species described to date: non-motile, catalase-negative, oxidase-positive, non-glucose fermenting, resistant to vancomycin and susceptible to kanamycin. cells exhibited a trilamellar membrane under electron microscopy. the fatty acid methyl ester profile was marginally related to that of clostridium botulinum group a (distance: 26.27%) and bifidobacterium bifidum gc subgroup b (distance: 26.38%). 16s rrna gene sequence  similarity was 90.0% with that of prevotella oris and 89.1% with that of prevotella melaninogenica. partial rpob gene sequence similarity was 84.5 and 86.4% with p. oris and p. melaninogenica, respectively. according to current standards, phenotypic traits, 16s rrna and rpob gene sequence analyses indicated  that the marseille isolate belonged to a previously unrecognized species of the genus prevotella, and we propose classifying it in the new taxon "prevotella massiliensis" sp. nov.
