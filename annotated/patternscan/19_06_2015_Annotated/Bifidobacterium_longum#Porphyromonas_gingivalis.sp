TI  == bifidobacterium longum-fermented broccoli supernatant inhibited the growth of candida albicans and some pathogenic bacteria in vitro.
AB  == the aim of this study is to develop a growth inhibitory material against some pathogenic microorganisms, using beneficial bacteria such as bifidobacterium species and certain types of vegetables which can be good substrates for the growth of the beneficial bacteria. at first, various vegetable juices were screened for the growth promotion of bifidobacterium longum etc. among the vegetables tested, broccoli (brassica oleracea l. var. botrytis l.) and cabbage (brassica oleracea l. var. capitata l.) showed excellent growth promoting activities for b. longum. secondly, the b. longum-fermented broccoli (bfb) and lactobacillus pentosus-fermented broccoli (lfb) supernatants were prepared and the growth inhibitory activities against candida albicans were determined. both of them showed dose-dependent, growth inhibitory effects, and the effect of bfb was superior to lfb. it was thought that the superior effect of bfb could be mainly attributed to the acids, especially acetic acid, produced by b. longum. bfb also inhibited some pathogenic bacteria such as streptococcus mutans and porphylomonas gingivalis. in conclusion, broccoli was found to be a good growth-promoting substance for b. longum. the fermented product, bfb, appears to  be a usable material that inhibits the growth of c. albicans and some pathogenic  bacteria.

TI  == reduction of vitamin k concentration by salivary bifidobacterium strains and their possible nutritional competition with porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == aims: to assess the possibility that bifidobacteria compete with porphyromonas gingivalis for their mutual growth factor vitamin k. this study also examined whether salivary bifidobacterium species decrease vitamin k concentration in the  growth medium. methods and results: sixty-five strains of bifidobacterium were obtained from 20 of 24 periodontally healthy subjects. bifidobacterium dentium was most frequently detected in the saliva of subjects, followed by bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium urinalis. the growth of most bifidobacterium isolates, except that of b. urinalis, was stimulated by vitamin k. moreover, the isolates were capable of decreasing vitamin k after incubation, which suggests that bifidobacteria compete with p. gingivalis for vitamin k. in a co-culture, a representative strain -b. adolescentis s2-1 - inhibited the growth of p. gingivalis if it was inoculated in the medium before p. gingivalis. conclusions: b. adolescentis s2-1 decreased vitamin k concentration and inhibited the growth of p. gingivalis by possibly competing for the growth factor. significance and impact of the study: salivary bifidobacteria may possess the potential to suppress the growth of p. gingivalis  by reducing the growth factor(s) in the environment.
