TI  == occurrence of periodontal pathogens in ethnic groups from a native brazilian reservation.
AB  == objective: the present study was designed to evaluate the occurrence of periodontal pathogens in the subgingival biofilm of 100 native brazilians living  at the umutina indian reservation, mato grosso state, brazil. methods: periodontal clinical examinations were carried out prior to collection of subgingival biofilm, and the presence of 14 periodontal microorganisms was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the prevalence and risk analysis was performed using cochran and mantel-haenszel statistics for dichotomous variables or pearson's chi-squared test for analysis of proportions when variables had three or more categories. the interrelations between clinical and microbiological parameters were assessed using fisher's exact test and the mann-whitney u test. results: individuals with chronic periodontitis were frequently colonized by the association between porphyromonas gingivalis and campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis and prevotella intermedia, or p. gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. patients with chronic periodontitis were also colonized by porphyromonas gulae and p. intermedia or by the association between p. gulae and t. forsythia. p. gulae was detected only in the subgingival samples from natives on a traditional diet. gingival bleeding was associated with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, t. forsythia, p.  gingivalis, p. gulae, porphyromonas endodontalis, p. intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens. treponema denticola was uncommon. conclusions: peculiar microbiota was demonstrated to be associated with different periodontal disease statuses in  native brazilians, with modest occurrence of certain pathogens, such as t. denticola, and the presence of p. gulae in natives with gingivitis or chronic periodontitis.

TI  == proinflammatory activity of primarily infected endodontic content against macrophages after different phases of the root canal therapy.
AB  == introduction: this study investigated the presence of target bacterial species and the levels of endotoxins in teeth with apical periodontitis. levels of inflammatory mediators (interleukin [il]-1beta and tumor necrosis factor [tnf]-alpha) were determined after macrophage stimulation with endodontic content after different phases of endodontic therapy using different irrigants. methods:  thirty primarily infected root canals were randomly assigned into 3 groups according to the irrigant used for root canal preparation (n = 10 per group): gi: 2.5% sodium hypochlorite, gii: 2% chlorhexidine gel, and giii (control group): saline solution. root canal samples were taken by using paper points before (s1)  and after root canal instrumentation (s2), subsequently to 17% edta (s3), after 30 days of intracanal medication (ca[oh]2 + saline solution) (s4), and before root canal obturation (s5). polymerase chain reaction (16s recombinant dna) and limulus amebocyte lysate assay were used for bacterial and endotoxin detection, respectively. macrophages were stimulated with the root canal contents for il-1beta/tnf-alpha measurement using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results:  porphyromonas gingivalis (17/30), porphyromonas endodontalis (15/30), and prevotella nigrescens (11/30) were the most prevalent bacterial species. at s1, endotoxins were detected in 100% of the root canals (median = 32.43 eu/ml). in parallel, substantial amounts of il-1beta and tnf-alpha were produced by endodontic content-stimulated macrophages. at s2, a significant reduction in endotoxin levels was observed in all groups, with gi presenting the greatest reduction (p < .05). after a root canal rinse with edta (s3), intracanal medication (s4), and before root canal obturation (s5), endotoxin levels reduced  without differences between groups (p < .05). il-1beta and tnf-alpha release decreased proportionally to the levels of residual endotoxin (p < .05). conclusions: regardless of the use of sodium hypochlorite or chx, the greatest endotoxin reduction occurs after chemomechanical preparation. increasing steps of root canal therapy associated with intracanal medication enhances endotoxin reduction, leading to a progressively lower activation of proinflammatory cells such as macrophages.

TI  == macrophage cell activation with acute apical abscess contents determined by interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha production.
AB  == introduction: this clinical study has investigated the antigenic activity of bacterial contents from exudates of acute apical abscesses (aaas) and their paired root canal contents regarding the stimulation capacity by levels of interleukin (il)-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) throughout the root canal treatment against macrophage cells. methods: paired samples of infected root canals and exudates of aaas were collected from 10 subjects. endodontic contents were sampled before (root canal sample [rcs] 1) and after chemomechanical preparation (rcs2) and after 30 days of intracanal medication with calcium hydroxide + chlorhexidine gel (ca[oh]2 + chx gel) (rcs3). polymerase chain reaction (16s rdna) was used for detection of the target bacteria, whereas  limulus amebocyte lysate was used to measure endotoxin levels. raw 264.7 macrophages were stimulated with aaa exudates from endodontic contents sampled in different moments of root canal treatment. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to measure the levels of tnf-alpha and il-1 beta. results: parvimonas micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, dialister pneumosintes, and prevotella nigrescens were the most frequently detected species. higher levels of endotoxins were found in samples from periapical exudates at rcs1 (p < .005). in fact, samples collected from periapical exudates showed a higher stimulation capacity at rcs1 (p < .05). a positive correlation was found between endotoxins from exudates with il-1 beta (r = 0.97) and tnf-alpha (r = 0.88) production (p < .01). the significant reduction of endotoxins and bacterial species achieved by chemomechanical procedures (rcs2) resulted in a lower capacity of root canal contents to stimulate the cells compared with that at rcs1 (p < .05). the use of  ca(oh)2 + chx gel as an intracanal medication (rcs3) improved the removal of endotoxins and bacteria from infected root canals (p < .05) whose contents induced a lower stimulation capacity against macrophages cells at rcs1, rcs2, and rcs3 (p < .05). conclusions: aaa exudates showed higher levels of endotoxins and  showed a greater capacity of macrophage stimulation than the paired root canal samples. moreover, the use of intracanal medication improved the removal of bacteria and endotoxins from infected root canals, which may have resulted in the reduction of the inflammatory potential of the root canal content.

TI  == an investigation of the presence of specific anaerobic species in necrotic primary teeth.
AB  == different microbial identification methods have shown that the microbial community profiles in endodontic infections are diverse and assorted. the aim of  this study was to evaluate the frequency of selected endodontic pathogens in the  pulp chambers (pcs) and root canals (rcs) of infected primary teeth using pcr methods. paired pc and rc samples were collected from 15 subjects and analyzed by pcr for the presence of filifactor alocis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella tannerae, tanerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and treponema socranskii. the frequency of each species was  determined in the pc and rc of each case. the species most frequently detected in pcs were p. nigrescens (86.7%), p. gingivalis (73.3%), and f. alocis (73.3%). of  the pc samples, 13.3% contained p. micra and t. denticola, and 6.7% contained t.  forsythia. the species most frequently detected in rcs were p. gingivalis (100%)  and p. nigrescens (93.3%). p. tannerae, p. micra, and t. denticola were found in  40% of the rc samples; t. forsythia was found in 26.7% of the rc samples. the "red complex", which comprises p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia, was not found in the pc of any tooth but was found in 30% of the rc samples. the detection of p. nigrescens in the pc was statistically associated with the presence of p. nigrescens in the rc (p = 0.04). the results suggest high heterogeneity among the samples, even among those from the same subject.

TI  == comparison of endotoxin levels found in primary and secondary endodontic infections.
AB  == introduction: this clinical study was conducted to compare the levels of endotoxins (lipopolysaccharides [lpss]) found in primary and secondary endodontic infections with apical periodontitis by correlating lps contents with clinical/radiographic findings. in addition, the presence of target gram-negative anaerobic bacteria was also investigated. methods: samples were taken from 15 root canals with primary infections and 15 with secondary infections by using paper points. the limulus amebocyte lysate assay was used to quantify endotoxins, and the polymerase chain reaction technique (16s rdna) was used for bacterial investigation. results: endotoxins were detected in 100% of the root canal samples collected from primary (15/15) and secondary (15/15) infections with median values of 7.49 eu/ml and 3.96 eu/ml, respectively (p < .05). the median value of endotoxins found in the presence of clinical symptoms was significantly  higher than in asymptomatic teeth with primary infections (p < .05). a positive correlation was found between endotoxin contents and a larger size of the radiolucent area (>3 mm) (p < .05). prevotella nigrescens (10/15, 4/15), fusobacterium nucleatum (5/15, 1/15), treponema denticola (3/15, 1/15), and treponema socranskii (5/15, 1/15) were detected in teeth with primary and secondary infections, respectively. p. endodontalis was present only in teeth with primary infections (5/15). conclusions: teeth with primary endodontic infections had higher contents of endotoxins and a more complex gram-negative bacterial community than teeth with secondary infections. moreover, the levels of endotoxins were related to the severity of bone destruction in periapical tissues as well as the development of clinical features in teeth with primary infections.

TI  == a microbiological profile of unexposed and exposed pulp space of primary endodontic infections by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to evaluate, by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization, the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in cases associated with exposed (n = 30) and unexposed (n = 30) pulp space. methods: samples were collected by means of a #15 h-type file and 2 sterile paper points from 60 single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp and periapical lesions. the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: the species found in higher counts (x10(5)) in exposed pulp space cases were eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii, tannerella forsythia, enterococcus faecalis, neisseria  mucosa, campylobacter gracilis, and prevotella nigrescens, and in unexposed pulp  space cases they were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, n. mucosa, e. faecalis, e. saburreum, c. gracilis, and porphyromonas gingivalis. counts of f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, campylobacter sputigena, capnocytophaga showae, treponema socrenskii,  porphyromonas endodontalis, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga ochracea were significantly higher in unexposed pulp space cases (p < .05). conclusions: the data of the present investigation suggested specific differences between the composition of the microbiota in cases with exposed and unexposed pulp space and  an association between higher levels of some specific species and unexposed pulp  space cases.

TI  == clustering behavior in microbial communities from acute endodontic infections.
AB  == introduction: acute endodontic infections harbor heterogeneous microbial communities in both the root canal (rc) system and apical tissues. data comparing the microbial structure and diversity in endodontic infections in related ecosystems, such as rc with necrotic pulp and acute apical abscess (aaa), are scarce in the literature. the aim of this study was to examine the presence of selected endodontic pathogens in paired samples from necrotic rc and aaa using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) followed by the construction of cluster profiles. methods: paired samples of rc and aaa exudates were collected from 20 subjects and analyzed by pcr for the presence of selected strict and facultative anaerobic strains. the frequency of species was compared between the rc and the aaa samples. a stringent neighboring clustering algorithm was applied to investigate  the existence of similar high-order groups of samples. a dendrogram was constructed to show the arrangement of the sample groups produced by the hierarchical clustering. results: all samples harbored bacterial dna. porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella nigrescens, filifactor alocis, and tannerela forsythia were frequently detected in both rc and aaa samples. the selected anaerobic species were distributed in diverse small bacteria consortia.  the samples of rc and aaa that presented at least one of the targeted microorganisms were grouped in small clusters. conclusions: anaerobic species were frequently detected in acute endodontic infections and heterogeneous microbial communities with low clustering behavior were observed in paired samples of rc and aaa.

TI  == antigenicity of primary endodontic infection against macrophages by the levels of pge(2) production.
AB  == introduction: root canal contents are potent stimuli for proinflammatory cytokines involved in apical periodontitis. this study investigated target gram-negative bacterial species and endotoxins in primary endodontic infection with apical periodontitis, determined their antigenicity against macrophages through the levels of pge(2), and evaluated their relationship with clinical findings. methods: samples were taken from 21 root canals with primary infection  and apical periodontitis by using paper points. polymerase chain reaction (16s rdna) was used for bacterial detection and limulus amebocyte lysate assay for endotoxin measurement. levels of prostaglandin e2 (pge(2)) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (duoset kit; r&d, minneapolis, mn). results: prevotella nigrescens (13/21), fusobacterium nucleatum (6/21), and porphyromonas  endodontalis (6/21) were the most frequently observed species. a positive association was found between f. nucleatum and p. endodontalis (p < .05). a correlation was found between the number of gram-negative bacterial species and the levels of endotoxins, such as pge(2) (p < .05). higher levels of endotoxin were detected in teeth with exudation, whereas elevated levels of pge(2) were found in teeth with tenderness to percussion and pain on palpation. conclusions:  our findings imply an additive effect between the number of gram-negative bacterial species involved in endodontic infection regarding the induction of proinflammatory cytokine by macrophage cells. moreover, teeth with clinical symptomatology were related to higher levels of endotoxins and pge(2) secretion.

TI  == antigenic activity of bacterial endodontic contents from primary root canal infection with periapical lesions against macrophage in the release of interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha.
AB  == introduction: periradicular tissue chronic stimulation by endotoxin may cause apical periodontitis. this study investigated the microbial profile and the levels of endotoxin found in primary root canal infection with apical periodontitis, determined their antigenicity against macrophages through the levels of interleukin (il)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), and evaluated their relationship with clinical and radiographic findings. methods: samples were taken from 21 root canals with primary endodontic infection and apical periodontitis with paper points. pcr technique (16s rdna) was used for the detection of the target bacteria. limulus amebocyte lysate (lal) was used to measure endotoxin. the amounts of il-1ss/ tnf-alpha in macrophages supernatants were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay--duoset-kit (elisa). results:  prevotella nigrescens (13/21), porphyromonas endodontalis (6/21), and treponema socranskii (6/21) were the most frequently detected gram-negative bacterial species. the presence of the sinus tract (2/21) was related to the detection of filifactor alocis (p < 0.05), whereas a tooth with a radiolucent area > or = 2 mm was related to the detection of treponema denticola. a correlation was found between the number of gram-negative bacteria and the levels of il-1beta/tnf-alpha (p < 0.05). increased levels of endotoxin were followed by tnf-alpha release (p < 0.05). higher levels of il-1beta (p < 0.05) and endotoxin contents were related to the larger size of the radiolucent area. conclusion: the antigenicity of the endodontic contents is not only related to the amount of endotoxin found in the root canal but also to the number of different species of gram-negative bacteria  involved in the infection. moreover, a larger size (> or = 2 mm) of the radiolucent area was related to il-1beta and endotoxin.

TI  == an agar diffusion comparison of the antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide at  five different concentrations with three different vehicles.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine if varying the percent (by weight) of  aqueous calcium hydroxide or using different vehicles had an effect on its antibacterial efficacy against common endodontic pathogens in a pour plate/traditional streak agar diffusion model. mixtures of calcium hydroxide powder and sterile saline in 40, 50 and 60 percent concentrations and the commercial preparations ultracal xs and vitapex were tested against six known endodontic pathogens with an agar diffusion method. each medicament was placed in one of five wells, in each of 10 agar plates (n = 10), for cultures of each bacterial species. zones of inhibition were measured after 48 hours incubation for aerobes and 96 hours incubation for anaerobes. multiple one-way analyses of variance and post-hoc student neuman keuls evaluated the data at alpha = 0.05. larger zones of inhibition were consistently observed for higher concentrations of calcium hydroxide with statistical significance among the bacteria, particularly between 40% and 60%. vitapex had significantly smaller zones of inhibition than all other medicaments and 35% ultracal xs with methylcellulose was nearly as effective as 50% ca(oh)(2) in inhibitory activity. formulations containing 50-60% ca(oh)(2) or 35% ca(oh)(2) with aqueous methylcellulose are recommended as endodontic interappointment medicaments.

TI  == microbial analysis of canals of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == the objective of the present study was to investigate the presence of nine bacterial species in root-filled teeth associated with periapical lesions using a polymerase chain reaction analysis and to correlate these species with clinical features of the cases. dna was extracted from 45 canal samples of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions. a pcr assay using species-specific primers of 16s  rdna and the downstream intergenic spacer region was used for microbial detection. enterococcus faecalis was the most prevalent species, detected in 77.8% of the study teeth, followed by peptostreptococcus micros, detected in 51.1%. porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens were detected in 35.6%, 22.2%, 11.1%, and 11.1% of the sampled teeth, respectively. moreover, pcr detected filifactor alocis in 26.7%, treponema denticola in 24.4%, and tannerella forsythia in 4.4% of the samples. t. denticola and p. micros were statistically associated with tenderness to percussion (p < 0.05). p. nigrescens was associated with the presence of spontaneous pain and abscess (p < 0.05). p. endodontalis and p. nigrescens were associated with purulent exudates (p < 0.05). synergistic relationship was also observed between some species. the results of this study indicated that e. faecalis was the most frequently identified test species by pcr in teeth with failing endodontic treatment.

TI  == evaluation of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections using checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in 111 selected cases of single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. methods: samples were collected from the  root canals using #15 hedstroen-type files and two sterile paper points, which were introduced 1 mm short of the apical foramen. the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 different bacterial species in each sample were determined using dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization techniques. results: the  mean number of species per sample was 22. enterococcus faecalis (89.3%), campylobacter gracilis (89.3%), leptotrichia buccalis (89.3%), neisseria mucosa (87.5%), prevotella melaninogenica (86.6%), fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii (85.7%), eubacterium saburreum (75.9%), streptococcus anginosus (75%),  and veillonella parvula (74.1%) were the most prevalent species. the species found in highest mean counts (over 10(5)) were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii (13.14 x 10(5)), e. saburreum (5.67 x 10(5)), e. faecalis (5.38 x 10(5)), n. mucosa (4.19 x 10(5)), v. parvula (3.63 x 10(5)), c. gracilis (3.46 x 10(5)), treponema  socranskii (3.34 x 10(5)), porphyromonas endodontalis (2.96 x 10(5)), porphyromonas gingivalis (2.85 x 10(5)), micromonas micros (2.81 x 10(5)), prevotella nigrescens (2.68 x 10(5)) and fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum (2.64 x 10(5)). most of these species were also found in high proportions. conclusions: our results suggest that several bacterial species considered to be  oral pathogens seem to be implicated in the etiology of primary endodontic infections.

TI  == detection of porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens in chronic endodontic infection.
AB  == black-pigmented anaerobic rods such as prevotella spp. and porphyromonas spp. are involved in the etiology and perpetuation of endodontic infections. the aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of these species in chronic endodontic  infections by using culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) techniques. samples of 100 patients with root canals displaying chronic endodontic infections were obtained by sterilized paper points. bacterial identification was performed  by using culture and pcr techniques. by culture, in 33% of the samples, p. intermedia-p. nigrescens (75.8%), p. gingivalis (27.3%), and p. endodontalis (9.1%) were identified, and by pcr 60% of the samples harbored p. nigrescens (43.3%), p. gingivalis (43.3%), p. intermedia (31.7%), and p. endodontalis (23.3%). the presence of these black-pigmented anaerobic rods alone or in association in chronic endodontic infections seems to be frequent. pcr is a very  sensitive technique for detecting dna from bacterial cells. culturing is only able to reveal living bacteria and is less sensitive for the identification of low numbers of bacterial cells.

TI  == multiplex polymerase chain reaction detection of black-pigmented bacteria in infections of endodontic origin.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to detect the presence of porphyromonas endodontalis, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, p. nigrescens, and p. tannerae from clinical samples using multiplex polymerase chain reactions (pcr).  two different multiplex pcr protocols were used (one for the two porphyromonas species and the other for the three prevotella species), each one using a primer  pair specific for each target species. the results were compared to those of the  conventional culture procedures. microbial samples were taken aseptically from 40 infected root canals and abscesses from patients. samples were cultured in an anaerobic condition for conventional identification using a rapid id 32 a kit. multiplex pcr was processed using the dna extracted from each sample. at least one of the five species of black-pigmented bacteria (bpb) were detected in 65% (26 of 40) of the samples using multiplex pcr, and in 15% (6 of 40) using the conventional culture procedures. multiplex pcr was more rapid, sensitive, specific, and effective in detecting bpb than the conventional culture procedures.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens in endodontic lesions detected by culture and by pcr.
AB  == he aim of this study was to investigate the presence of four black-pigmented bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens, in endodontic infections by culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analyses. microbial samples were obtained from 50 teeth with untreated necrotic pulps (primary infection) and from 50 teeth with failing endodontic treatment (secondary infection). microbiological strict anaerobic techniques were used for serial dilution, plating, incubation, and identification. for pcr detection, the samples were analyzed using species-specific primers of 16s rdna and the downstream intergenic spacer region. culture and pcr detected the test species in 13/100 and 50/100 of the study teeth, respectively. the organisms were cultured from 11/50 (22%) of primarily infected root canal samples and from 2/50 (4%) of secondary root canal samples. pcr detection identified the target species in 32/50 (64%) and 18/50 (36%) of primary and secondary infections, respectively. p. gingivalis was rarely isolated by culture methods (1%), but was the most frequently identified test species by pcr (38%). similarly, p. endodontalis was not recovered by culture from any tooth studied, but was detected by pcr in 25% of the sampled teeth. pcr-based identification also showed higher detection rates of p. intermedia (33%) and p. nigrescens (22%) than culture (13%). in conclusion, p. gingivalis, p. endodontalis, p. intermedia, and p. nigrescens were identified more frequently in teeth with necrotic pulp than in teeth with failing endodontic treatment. also, a higher frequency of black-pigmented species was detected by pcr than by culture.

TI  == selected endodontic pathogens in the apical third of infected root canals: a molecular investigation.
AB  == bacteria located at the apical portion of the root canals are conceivably in a strategic position to induce damage to the periradicular tissues and resulting inflammatory diseases. this study sought to investigate the prevalence of 11 selected putative endodontic pathogens in the apical third of infected root canals associated with periradicular lesions. the apical root portion of 23 extracted teeth with carious pulpal exposures and attached periradicular lesions  was sectioned, and the root canals were sampled for microbiological investigation. dna was extracted from the samples and analyzed for the presence of 11 bacterial species using a nested polymerase chain reaction assay. the results showed that pseuramibacter alactolyticus occurred in 10 cases (44%), treponema denticola in 6 (26%), fusobacterium nucleatum in 6 (26%), porphyromonas endodontalis in 4 (17%), filifactor alocis in 2 (9%), dialister pneumosintes in 1 (4%), porphyromonas gingivalis in 1 (4%), and tannerella forsythensis in 1 (4%).  no sample yielded prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, or campylobacter  rectus. of the samples examined, 17 were positive for at least 1 of the target species. occurrence of these bacterial species in the apical third of infected root canals suggests that they can be involved in causation of periradicular lesions.

TI  == geographical differences in bacteria detected in endodontic infections using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) is an innovative nucleic acid-based assay that has the highest sensitivity of any microbiological technique for the detection of bacteria. the purpose of this study was to use pcr to detect the presence of specific species of bacteria in samples collected from two geographical locations. microbial samples from abscesses of endodontic origin were collected from patients in portland, oregon, and rio de janeiro, brazil. pcrs with species-specific oligonucleotide primers for the 16s ribosomal rna gene were used for detection of the bacteria after dna extraction from each clinical sample. statistical analysis revealed that there was a significant difference in  detection of the bacteria between the two geographical locations for prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella tannerae, fusobacterium nucleatum,  and porphyromonas gingivalis, but not for porphyromonas endodontalis, fusobacterium necrophorum, and enterococcus faecalis. these results suggest that  differences in bacteria detected or cultured in studies can be associated with geographical location.

TI  == microbiological examination of infected dental root canals.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to investigate the root canal microbiota of primary and secondary root-infected canals and the association of constituent species with specific endodontic signs and symptoms. methods: microbial samples were taken from 60 root canals, 41 with necrotic pulp tissues (primary infection) and 19 with failed endodontic treatment (secondary infection). strict anaerobic techniques were used for serial dilution, plating, incubation and identification. results: a total of 224 cultivable isolates were recovered belonging to 56 different bacterial species. individual root canals yielded a maximum of 10 bacterial species. of the bacterial isolates, 70% were either strict anaerobes or microphilic. the anaerobes most frequently isolated were: peptostreptococcus micros (35%), fusobacterium necrophorum (23.3%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.7%), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (16.7%), porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%) and porphyromonas endodontalis (5%). the root canal microflora of untreated teeth with apical periodontitis was found to be mixed, comprising gram-negative and gram-positive and mostly anaerobic microorganisms and usually containing more than 3 species per canal. on the other hand, facultative anaerobic and gram-positive bacteria predominated in canals with failed endodontic treatment, which harbored 1-2 species per canal. suggested relationships were found between  anaerobes, especially gram-negatives, and the presence or history of pain, tenderness to percussion and swelling (p<0.05). in particular, associations were  found between: a) pain (n=29) and p. micros (p<0.01), p. intermedia/nigrescens and eubacterium spp. (both p<0.05); b) history of pain (n=31) and p. micros (p<0.01) porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); c) tenderness to percussion (n=29) and porphyromonas spp. (p<0.01), peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.001); d) swelling (n=20) and peptostreptococcus spp. (p<0.01), porphyromonas and enterococcus spp. (p<0.05); e) wet canals (n=33) and  porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); f) purulent exudate (n=20) and porphyromonas, peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); previous endodontic treatment and enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus spp., p. micros, f. necrophorum (p<0.05). conclusions: our findings indicate potential complex interactions of species resulting in characteristic clinical pictures which cannot be achieved by individual species alone. they also indicate that the microbiota of primary infected canals with apical periodontitis differs in number and in species from the secondary infected canals by using the culture technique.

AB  == objectives: microbial flora and gingival conditions were compared between a group of patients with phenytoin-induced gingival hyperplasia as a test group, a control group of patients who were administered phenytoin without gingival hyperplasia and a blank group who took no phenytoin and no gingival hyperplasia in mentally retarded patients. materials and methods: subgingival plaque samples  were collected from a pht-induced overgrown gingival pocket and microbiological experiments were performed by culture and pcr methods. results: the predominant genera in total cultivable bacteria from subgingival plaque samples were streptococcus and actinomyces with recovery ranges of 37.6-42.1% and 23.4-25.5% of total bacteria, respectively, in all groups. the test group showed a significantly higher level of obligate gram-negative rods than the control and blank groups. black-pigmented obligate anaerobic gram-negative rods were detected in 10.3% of total cultivable bacteria in the test group. the black-pigmented rods were predominantly prevotella intermedia in the test group and prevotella nigrescens in the control and blank groups. porphyromonas gingivalis and porphyromonas endodontalis were also detected in the test group with small values. conclusions: these results suggested that black-pigmented rods, particularly p. intermedia, could be habitable in the environment of gingival hyperplasia.

TI  == microbiological, immunological and genetic factors in family members with periodontitis as a manifestation of systemic disease, associated with hematological disorders.
AB  == the microflora, immunological profiles of host defence functions, and human leukocyte antigen (hla) findings are reported for a mother, son and daughter who  were diagnosed as having 'periodontitis as a manifestation of systemic diseases,  associated with hematological disorders'. examinations were made of the bacterial flora from the periodontal pocket, neutrophil chemotaxis, neutrophil phagocytosis, and the genotypes (dqb1) and serotypes (dr locus) of hla class ii antigens. phenotypic analyses of the peripheral lymphocytes were also conducted.  the subgingival microflora from the mother was dominated by gram-negative rods, especially porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum. subgingival microflora samples from the son and daughter were dominated by gram-positive cocci and gram-positive rods. through the use of polymerase chain reaction, campylobacter rectus and capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in all subjects, whereas porphyromonas gingivalis, p. intermedia, and treponema denticola were not detected in any subjects. all three subjects showed a remarkable level of depressed neutrophil chemotaxis to n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, although their phagocyte function levels were normal, in comparison to healthy control subjects. each subject had the same genotype, hla-dqb1*0601, while the mother had hla-dr2 and hla-dr8, and the son and daughter had hla-dr2 only. in summary, the members of this family showed a similar predisposition to periodontitis with regard to certain host defence functions. it is suggested that the depressed neutrophil chemotaxis that was identified here could be a significant risk factor for periodontitis in this family.

TI  == molecular detection of black-pigmented bacteria in infections of endodontic origin.
AB  == a 16s rdna-directed polymerase chain reaction method was used to assess the occurrence of four black-pigmented anaerobic rods in root canal infections. samples were obtained from 54 infected teeth. ten cases were diagnosed as acute periradicular abscesses. dna was extracted from the samples and analyzed using a  polymerase chain reaction-based identification assay. the method allowed detection of black-pigmented bacteria anaerobes in 59.3% of the examined teeth. twelve cases yielded more than one black-pigmented species. in general porphyromonas endodontalis was found in 42.6%, porphyromonas gingivalis in 27.8%, prevotella nigrescens in 7.4%, and prevotella intermedia in 5.6% of the cases. p. endodontalis was found in 70% of the pus samples, p. gingivalis in 40%, and p. intermedia in 10%. p. gingivalis was always found associated with p. endodontalis in abscessed teeth. p. nigrescens was not found in any pus sample. the high prevalence of p. endodontalis and p. gingivalis suggests that they can play an important role in the pathogenesis of periradicular diseases.

TI  == detection of putative oral pathogens in acute periradicular abscesses by 16s rdna-directed polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == a 16s rdna-directed polymerase chain reaction method was used to assess the occurrence of four black-pigmented anaerobic rods, treponema denticola, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in acute periradicular abscesses. pus was collected by aspiration from 10 cases diagnosed as acute abscesses of endodontic  origin. dna was extracted from the samples and analyzed using a polymerase chain  reaction-based identification assay. the method allowed detecting black-pigmented anaerobes in 80% of the examined abscesses. porphyromonas endodontalis was found  in 70%, t. denticola in 50%, porphyromonas gingivalis in 40%, and prevotella intermedia in 10% of the cases. p. gingivalis was always found associated with p. endodontalis. prevotella nigrescens and a. actinomycetemcomitans were not found in any pus sample. the high prevalence of p. endodontalis, t. denticola, and p. gingivalis suggests that they can play an important role in the etiology of acute periradicular abscesses.

TI  == "checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  == background: we explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum igg responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. methods: one hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients  aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject;  2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic dna probes. serum igg antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. results: cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of eikenella corrodens, veillonella  parvula, and actinomyces naeslundii in controls. cases displayed higher igg levels against p. gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against f. nucleatum, t. denticola, e. nodatum,  and capnocytophaga ochracea. positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. in cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species  out of which only one was positive (v. parvula). both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. a logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. conclusion: a combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.

TI  == survey for collagenase gene prtc in porphyromonas gingivalis and porphyromonas endodontalis isolated from endodontic infections.
AB  == collagenase is a potential virulence factor shown to be expressed by porphyromonas gingivalis associated with periodontal disease. the purpose of this study was to use the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to detect the presence of the collagenase gene (prtc) in 21 strains of porphyromonas species isolated from  endodontic infections. type strains for p. gingivalis (atcc 33277), p. endodontalis (atcc 35406), prevotella intermedia (atcc 25611), and prevotella nigrescens (atcc 33563) were used as controls. when pcr primers specific for the  16s ribosomal rna gene of p. gingivalis or p. endodontalis were used, 16 of the strains were identified as p. gingivalis, and five strains were identified as p.  endodontalis. the presence of the prtc gene for collagenase was detected using pcr. amplicons were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, with an 815 bp amplicon representing the presence of the collagenase gene. type strain atcc 33277 and all 16 clinical isolates of p. gingivalis produced the collagenase gene amplicon. neither type strain atcc 35406 nor the five strains from clinical isolates of p. endodontalis produced the collagenase gene amplicon. these results indicate that p. gingivalis from endodontic infections possesses the prtc gene. p. endodontalis does not seem to exhibit prtc. the virulence of p. gingivalis may be related to its production of collagenase.

TI  == black-pigmented anaerobic rods in closed periapical lesions.
AB  == aim: this study determined the frequency of porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens in 20 closed periapical lesions associated with symptomatic and asymptomatic refractory endodontic disease. methodology: to deliniate possible oral sources of p. endodontalis, the presence of the organism was assessed in selected subgingival sites and saliva in the same study patients. periapical samples were obtained by  paper points during surgical endodontic procedures using methods designed to minimize contamination by non-endodontic microorganisms. subgingival plaque samples were obtained by paper points from three periodontal pockets and from the pocket of the tooth associated with the closed periapical lesion. unstimulated saliva was collected from the surface of the soft palate. bacterial identification was performed using a species-specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detection method. results: p. endodontalis was not identified in any periapical lesion, even though subgingival samples from eight patients (40%) revealed the p. endodontalis-specific amplicon. p. gingivalis occurred in one periapical lesion that was associated with moderate pain. p. nigrescens, p. endodontalis and p. intermedia were not detected in any periapical lesion studied. conclusions: black-pigmented anaerobic rods appear to be infrequent inhabitants of the closed periapical lesion.

TI  == pathogenicity of facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria in monoculture and combined with either prevotella intermedia or prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == the pathogenicity of obligate and facultative anaerobic bacteria commonly found in endodontic infections was tested using a mouse model. the capacity of inducing abscesses was evaluated seven days after subcutaneous injection of the bacteria in pure culture and in combinations with either prevotella intermedia or prevotella nigrescens. nine of the fifteen bacterial strains tested were pathogenic in pure culture. no statistically significant differences were detected between these strains in pure culture and in mixtures with either p. intermedia or p. nigrescens. synergism between the bacterial strains was only apparent when associating porphyromonas endodontalis with p. intermedia or p. nigrescens. histopathological examination of tissue sections from induced abscesses revealed an acute inflammatory reaction, dominated by polymorphonuclear leukocytes. sections from the control group using sterile medium showed no evidence of inflammatory reaction.

TI  == recently described clinically important anaerobic bacteria: taxonomic aspects and update.
AB  == a new method of identifying bacteria, phylogenetic 16s rrna sequencing, has led to major reorganizations among most genera of anaerobic bacteria. the pigmented prevotella species now comprise seven species including p. nigrescens and p. tannerae; p. intermedia/p. nigrescens-like organisms await inclusion. the former  mitsuokella dentalis and hallella seregens were transferred to prevotella as one  species, p. dentalis. p. enoeca is a new nonpigmenting prevotella. the genus porphyromonas currently includes 11 pigmented species and one nonpigmented species, p. catoniae; p. levii-like and p. endodontalis-like organisms are candidates for the genus. fusobacterium nucleatum currently has five subspecies,  and f. varium includes the former f. pseudonecrophorum. former wolinella recta and wolinella curva now are campylobacter rectus and campylobacter curvus; campylobacter showae is a new species. isolates included in the bile-sensitive former bacteroides gracilis now are campylobacter gracilis; the bile-resistant b. gracilis isolates were transferred to a new genus, sutterella, as s. wadsworthensis. the new actinomyces species include two subspecies of the a. neuii and the a. radingae-a. turicensis complex. the genus eubacterium sensu stricto is represented by e. limosum, and the former e. alactolyticum was reclassified in a new genus, pseudoramibacter, as p. alactolyticus. recent entries include e. saphenum, e. minutum, e. exiguum, e. infirmum, and e. tardum.  a new genus, atopobium houses some former lactobacilli and streptococci. the genus peptostreptococcus also have four new species; p. hydrogenalis, p. lacrimalis, p. lactolyticus, and p. vaginalis.

TI  == phototoxicity of argon laser irradiation on biofilms of porphyromonas and prevotella species.
AB  == species of prevotella (pr.) and porphyromonas (po.) and other microorganisms were cultivated as biofilms on agar medium and examined for their susceptibility to argon laser irradiation (continuous mode; wavelengths, 488-514 nm; fluences, 20-200 j cm(-2)). fluences of 35 to 80 j cm(-2) inhibited biofilm growth in po. endodontalis, po. gingivalis, pr. denticola, pr. intermedia, pr. melaninogenica and pr. nigrescens. a fluence of 70 j cm(-2) did not affect biofilm growth in species of bacillus, candida, enterobacter, proteus, pseudomonas, staphylococcus  and streptococcus. the phototoxic effects of argon laser irradiation against prevotella and porphyromonas species were: (1) caused by the radiation alone; (2) modified by biofilm age; (3) dependent on the presence of atmospheric oxygen; (4) influenced by medium supplements of hemin, hemoglobin and blood; (5) greater when compared with other microbial species; (6) demonstrated without augmentation with an exogenous photosensitizer; and (7) apparently unrelated to the protoporphyrin  content of the cells. overall, these in vitro findings suggest that low doses of  argon laser radiation may be effective in the treatment and/or prevention of clinical infections caused by biofilm-associated species of prevotella or porphyromonas.

TI  == oligonucleotide probes to the 16s ribosomal rna: implications of sequence homology and secondary structure with particular reference to the oral species prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == eight oligonucleotides based upon regions of the small subunit 16s ribosomal rna  gene sequences were analysed against a background of their position within the molecule and their two-dimensional structure to rationalise their use in recognising prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens. the 41 clinical isolates from both oral and respiratory sites and two reference strains were subjected to dna-dna hybridisation and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis to confirm their identity. alignment of oligonucleotide probes designated i bi-2 to  i bi-6 (for p. intermedia) and 2bi-2 (for p. nigrescens) with the 16s rrna suggested that these probes lacked specificity or were constructed from hypervariable regions. a 52-mer oligonucleotide (designated bi) reliably detected both species. because of the high degree of concordance between the 16s rrnas of  both species, it was necessary to vary the stringency of hybridisation conditions for detection of both species. thus probe i bi-i recognised p. intermedia while i bi-i detected both p. intermedia and p. nigrescens at low stringency. however, under conditions of high stringency only p. nigrescens was recognised by probe 2bi-i. these probes were highly specific and did not hybridise with dna from the  closely related p. corporis, nor other periodontal pathogens such as fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola and several pigmented species such as prevotella melaninogenica, p. denticola, p. loescheii, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, py. endodontalis, py. gingivalis, py. levii, and py. macacae.

TI  == phylogeny of bacteroides, prevotella, and porphyromonas spp. and related bacteria.
AB  == the phylogenetic structure of the bacteroides subgroup of the cytophaga-flavobacter-bacteroides (cfb) phylum was examined by 16s rrna sequence  comparative analysis. approximately 95% of the 16s rrna sequence was determined for 36 representative strains of species of prevotella, bacteroides, and porphyromonas and related species by a modified sanger sequencing method. a phylogenetic tree was constructed from a corrected distance matrix by the neighbor-joining method, and the reliability of tree branching was established by bootstrap analysis. the bacteroides subgroup was divided primarily into three major phylogenetic clusters which contained most of the species examined. the first cluster, termed the prevotella cluster, was composed of 16 species of prevotella, including p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, and the ruminal species p. ruminicola. two oral species, p. zoogleoformans and p. heparinolytica, which had been recently placed in the genus prevotella, did not fall within the prevotella cluster. these two species and six species of bacteroides, including the type species b. fragilis, formed the second cluster, termed the bacteroides cluster. the third cluster, termed the porphyromonas cluster, was divided into two subclusters. the first contained porphyromonas gingivalis, p. endodontalis, p. asaccharolytica, p. circumdentaria, p. salivosa,  [bacteroides] levii (the brackets around genus are used to indicate that the species does not belong to the genus by the sensu stricto definition), and [bacteroides] macacae, and the second subcluster contained [bacteroides] forsythus and [bacteroides] distasonis. [bacteroides] splanchnicus fell just outside the three major clusters but still belonged within the bacteroides subgroup. with few exceptions, the 16 s rrna data were in overall agreement with  previously proposed reclassifications of species of bacteroides, prevotella, and  porphyromonas. suggestions are made to accommodate those species which do not fit previous reclassification schemes.
