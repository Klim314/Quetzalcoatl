TI  == biochemical characterization and fad-binding analysis of oleate hydratase from macrococcus caseolyticus.
AB  == a putative fatty acid hydratase gene from macrococcus caseolyticus was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the recombinant enzyme was a 68 kda dimer with a molecular mass of 136 kda. the enzymatic products formed from fatty acid substrates by the putative enzyme were isolated with high purity (>99%) by solvent fractional crystallization at low temperature. after the identification by gc-ms, the purified hydroxy fatty acids were used as standards to quantitatively determine specific activities and kinetic parameters for fatty acids as substrates. among the fatty acids evaluated, specific activity and catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/k(m)) were highest for oleic acid, indicating that the putative fatty acid hydratase was an oleate hydratase. hydration occurred only for cis-9-double and cis-12-double bonds of unsaturated fatty acids without  any trans-configurations. the maximum activity for oleate hydration was observed  at ph 6.5 and 25 degrees c with 2% (v/v) ethanol and 0.2 mm fad. without fad, all catalytic activity was abolished. thus, the oleate hydratase is an fad-dependent  enzyme. the residues g29, g31, s34, e50, and e56, which are conserved in the fad-binding motif of fatty acid hydratases (gxgxxg((a/s))x((15-21))e((d))), were  selected by alignment, and the spectral properties and kinetic parameters of their alanine-substituted variants were analyzed. among the five variants, g29a,  g31a, and e56a showed no interaction with fad and exhibited no activity. these results indicate that g29, g31, and e56 are essential for fad-binding.
