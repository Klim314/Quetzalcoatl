TI  == maternal exposure to fish oil primes offspring to harbor intestinal pathobionts associated with altered immune cell balance.
AB  == our previous studies revealed that offspring from rat dams fed fish oil (at 8% and 18% energy), developed impaired intestinal barriers sensitizing the colon to  exacerbated injury later in life. to discern the mechanism, we hypothesized that  in utero exposure to fish oil, rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (pufa), caused abnormal intestinal reparative responses to mucosal injury through differences in intestinal microbiota and the presence of naive immune cells. to identify such mechanisms, gut microbes and naive immune cells were compared between rat pups born to dams fed either n-6 pufa, n-3 pufa or breeder chow. maternal exposure to either of the pufa rich diets altered the development of the intestinal microbiota with an overall reduction in microbial density. using qpcr, we found that each type of pufa differentially altered the major gut phyla; fish  oil increased bacteroidetes and safflower oil increased firmicutes. both pufa diets reduced microbes known to dominate the infant gut like enterobacteriaceae and bifidobacteria spp. when compared to the chow group. uniquely, maternal fish  oil diets resulted in offspring showing blooms of opportunistic pathogens like bilophila wadsworthia, enterococcus faecium and bacteroides fragilis in their gut microbiota. as well, fish oil groups showed a reduction in colonic cd8+ t cells,  cd4+ foxp3+ t cells and arginase+ m2 macrophages. in conclusion, fish oil supplementation in pharmacological excess, at 18% by energy as shown in this study, provides an example where excess dosing in utero can prime offspring to harbor intestinal pathobionts and alter immune cell homeostasis.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility profiles of anaerobic pathogens in the netherlands.
AB  == the antibiotic susceptibility profile of the bacteroides fragilis group, gram-positive anaerobic cocci (gpac), fusobacterium spp., prevotella spp., veillonella spp. and bilophila wadsworthia for amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, clindamycin and metronidazole was determined. human  clinical isolates were isolated between 2011 and 2013 at the microbiological diagnostic laboratory of the university medical center groningen, the netherlands and subjected to maldi-tof ms identification and susceptibility testing using e-test for mic determination. differences in clindamycin susceptibility between species of the b. fragilis group and gpac were observed, with bacteroides ovatus  and peptoniphilus harei having the highest resistance rates. compared to other european countries, in the netherlands the mic90 for clindamycin of fusobacteria  is low. metronidazole resistance was first encountered in the genus prevotella in 2013, but not in species of gpac as reported in belgium and bulgaria. the differences in clindamycin resistance between the different european countries and reports of metronidazole resistance within the genera prevotella and gpac warrant more extensive susceptibility studies on anaerobic pathogens.

TI  == anal gas evacuation and colonic microbiota in patients with flatulence: effect of diet.
AB  == objective: to characterise the influence of diet on abdominal symptoms, anal gas  evacuation, intestinal gas distribution and colonic microbiota in patients complaining of flatulence. design: patients complaining of flatulence (n=30) and  healthy subjects (n=20) were instructed to follow their usual diet for 3 days (basal phase) and to consume a high-flatulogenic diet for another 3 days (challenge phase). results: during basal phase, patients recorded more abdominal  symptoms than healthy subjects in daily questionnaires (5.8+/-0.3 vs 0.4+/-0.2 mean discomfort/pain score, respectively; p=<0.0001) and more gas evacuations by  an event marker (21.9+/-2.8 vs 7.4+/-1.0 daytime evacuations, respectively; p=0.0001), without differences in the volume of gas evacuated after a standard meal (262+/-22 and 265+/-25 ml, respectively). on flatulogenic diet, both groups  recorded more abdominal symptoms (7.9+/-0.3 and 2.8+/-0.4 discomfort/pain, respectively), number of gas evacuations (44.4+/-5.3 and 21.7+/-2.9 daytime evacuations, respectively) and had more gas production (656+/-52 and 673+/-78 ml, respectively; p<0.05 vs basal diet for all). when challenged with flatulogenic diet, patients' microbiota developed instability in composition, exhibiting variations in the main phyla and reduction of microbial diversity, whereas healthy subjects' microbiota were stable. taxa from bacteroides fragilis or bilophila wadsworthia correlated with number of gas evacuations or volume of gas  evacuated, respectively. conclusions: patients complaining of flatulence have a poor tolerance of intestinal gas, which is associated with instability of the microbial ecosystem.

TI  == pcr-based detection of resistance genes in anaerobic bacteria isolated from intra-abdominal infections.
AB  == little information is available on the distribution of antimicrobial resistance genes in anaerobes in japan. to understand the background of antimicrobial resistance in anaerobes involved in intra-abdominal infections, we investigated the distribution of eight antimicrobial resistance genes (cepa, cfia, cfxa, ermf, ermb, mefa, tetq, and nim) and a mutation in the gyra gene in a total of 152 organisms (bacteroides spp., prevotella spp., fusobacterium spp., porphyromonas spp., bilophila wadsworthia, desulfovibrio desulfuricans, veillonella spp., gram-positive cocci, and non-spore-forming gram-positive bacilli) isolated between 2003 and 2004 in japan. the cepa gene was distributed primarily in bacteroides fragilis. gene cfxa was detected in about 9 % of the bacteroides isolates and 75 % of the prevotella spp. isolates and did not appear to contribute to cephamycin resistance. two strains of b. fragilis contained the metallo-beta-lactamase gene cfia, but they did not produce the protein product. gene tetq was detected in about 81, 44, and 63 % of b. fragilis isolates, other bacteroides spp., and prevotella spp. isolates, respectively. the ermf gene was detected in 25, 13, 56, 64, and 16 % of bacteroides spp., prevotella spp., fusobacterium spp., b. wadsworthia, and anaerobic cocci, respectively. gene mefa  was found in only 10 % of the b. fragilis strains and 3 % of the non-b. fragilis  strains. genes nim and ermb were not detected in any isolate. substitution at position 82 (ser to phe) in gyra was detected in b. fragilis isolates that were less susceptible or resistant to moxifloxacin. this study is the first report on  the distribution of resistance genes in anaerobes isolated from intra-abdominal infections in japan. we expect that the results might help in understanding the resistance mechanisms of specific anaerobes.

TI  == [application of "microring an" to "level 1": presumptive identification of anaerobic gram-negative bacilli].
AB  == commonly isolated anaerobic gram-negative rods (4 genus 64 strains), some other important gram-negative anaerobic species (9 genus 45 strains), and cigar-shaped  clostridia (11 strains) were studied on their susceptibility patterns to 6 agents on "microring an". some modifications were made in the methods and interpretation of results. susceptibility patterns to erythromycin, rifampicin, colistin, benzylpenicillin, kanamycin, and vancomycin were following (sensitive [s], intermediate [i], resistant [r], variable [v]): for bacteroides fragilis group, v, s, r, r, r, r, respectively; for non-pigmented prevotella, v, s, v, v, r, r, respectively; for pigmented prevotella, s, s, sr, v, v, r, respectively: for fusobacterium nucleatum/necrophorum, r(s), s(i), s(ir), s(r), s, r, respectively; and for f. varium, r, r, s/i, r(s), s, r, respectively. some results were different from that in the data table in the instruction of "microring an", because of differences of methodology and changes of susceptibility of those species during years. as to the other groups, that are not included in the data table in the instruction, results were following: for bilophila wadsworthia, r, r, s, r, s, r, respectively; desulfovibrio, v, r(s), r, r, s, r, respectively; for cigar-shaped clostridia, v, s(r), r, r, s(r), s, respectively. "microring an" was useful for presumptive identification in genus, species, or group level, though morphological observation and some additional simple tests such as bile-sensitivity and catalase were essential.

TI  == in vitro activity of ramoplanin and comparator drugs against anaerobic intestinal bacteria from the perspective of potential utility in pathology involving bowel flora.
AB  == susceptibility of intestinal bacteria to various antimicrobial agents in vitro, together with levels of those agents achieved in the gut, provides information on the likely impact of the agents on the intestinal flora. orally administered drugs that are poorly absorbed may be useful for treatment of intestinal infections and for certain other situations in which intestinal bacteria may play a role. the antimicrobial activity of ramoplanin (mdl 62,198) against 928 strains of intestinal anaerobic bacteria was determined using the nccls-approved wadsworth brucella laked-blood agar dilution method. the activity of ramoplanin was compared with that of ampicillin, bacitracin, metronidazole, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (tmp/smx), and vancomycin. the organisms tested included bacteroides fragilis group (n=89), other bacteroides species (n=16), other anaerobic gram-negative rods (n=56) anaerobic cocci (n=114), clostridium species (n=426), and non-sporeforming anaerobic gram-positive rods (n=227). the overall mic(90)s of ramoplanin, ampicillin, bacitracin, metronidazole, and vancomycin were 256, 32, 128, 16, and 128 mcg/ml, respectively. ramoplanin was almost always highly active vs. gram-positive organisms and relatively poor in activity against gram-negative organisms, particularly bacteroides, bilophila, prevotella, and veillonella. vancomycin was quite similar to ramoplanin in its activity. ampicillin was relatively poor in activity vs. organisms that often produce beta-lactamase, including most of the gram-negative rods as well as clostridium bolteae and c. clostridioforme. bacitracin was relatively poor in activity against most anaerobic gram-negative rods, but better vs. most gram-positive organisms. metronidazole was very active against all groups other than bifidobacteria and some strains of other types of non-sporeforming gram-positive bacilli. tmp/smx was very poorly active, with an mic(90) of >2048 mcg/ml.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin compared to seven other oral antimicrobial agents against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from antral sinus puncture specimens from patients with sinusitis.
AB  == using a microbroth method for aerobes and agar dilution for anaerobes, we studied the comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, three fluoroquinolones, two macrolides and two beta-lactams, against 207 aerobic and 162 anaerobic antral sinus puncture isolates. gemifloxacin was active at < or = 0.25 ug/ml against 198/207 [96%] aerobes and 127/162 [78%] anaerobes or 325/369 [88%] of all isolates and was the most active quinolone on a weight basis against gram-positive organisms. all haemophilus and moraxella species were susceptible to < or =0.06 ug/ml of gemifloxacin. thirty-five anaerobic isolates [35/162, 22%] required > or =0.5 ug/ml of gemifloxacin for inhibition, including all prevotella species [all except one strain of p. bivia were susceptible to < or = 2 ug/ml] and occasional strains of bacteroides uniformis, bacteroides fragilis, bilophila  wadsworthia, peptostreptococcus magnus, peptostreptococcus micros, propionibacterium acnes, and veillonella species. all fusobacteria were susceptible to < or =0.25 ug/ml of gemifloxacin. based on our in vitro study results, we conclude that gemifloxacin may offer a therapeutic alternative for sinus infections.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of non-bacteroides fragilis group anaerobic gram-negative bacilli in europe.
AB  == objective: to investigate the in vitro activity of a range of anti-anaerobe antimicrobials against non-bacteroides fragilis group anaerobic gram-negative bacilli isolated in europe. methods: isolates from 15 laboratories in 13 countries were identified by conventional methods. the mics of 20 antibiotics were determined by an agar dilution method. results: there were 488 prevotella spp., 174 fusobacteria, 69 porphyromonas spp., 33 bacteroides spp., 28 bilophila  wadsworthia and 16 campylobacter spp. isolates, one sutterella wadsworthensis isolate and four unidentified isolates. penicillin resistance (and diminished susceptibility to piperacillin) was most common in prevotella spp. and bilophila  wadsworthia but was also seen in many other species. all isolates, except three of bilophila wadsworthia, were susceptible to amoxycillin/clavulanate. most isolates were susceptible to cefoxitin (except bilophila wadsworthia) and all were susceptible to the carbapenems. clinafloxacin was the most active quinolone, followed by trovafloxacin and then sparfloxacin. most fusobacteria were inherently resistant to the macrolides, as expected, but resistance to macrolides and a ketolide in other species was uncommon. most fusobacterium varium isolates  were resistant to clindamycin, but resistance to clindamycin in all other species was rare. tetracycline resistance was common but this did not affect the glycylcyclines. there was one isolate of bacteroides putredinis resistant to chloramphenicol, and three isolates, a bacteroides ureolyticus isolate, the sutterella wadsworthensis isolate and one of the unnamed isolates, were metronidazole resistant. rifampicin was active against most prevotella and porphyromonas spp., but not against many other genera. conclusions: penicillin resistance has increased in europe among non-bacteroides fragilis anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, much of it due to beta-lactamase. acquired resistance to other beta-lactams, macrolides and rifampicin has not significantly increased, and chloramphenicol and metronidazole are unaffected. however, resistance to tetracycline is common. the new compounds, a ketolide (hmr 3647), the glycylcyclines and clinafloxacin, are highly active.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of abt-773 against 362 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of abt-773, a novel ketolide antibiotic, against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined and compared to the activities of other antimicrobial agents. mics at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=0.06 microg/ml for actinomyces spp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus spp., propionibacterium spp., and porphyromonas spp. the mic(50)s and mic(90)s were </=0.06 and >32 microg/ml, respectively, for eubacterium spp., lactobacillus spp., clostridium difficile, and clostridium ramosum. the mic(90) for bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides ureolyticus, and campylobacter gracilis was 1 microg/ml, and that for prevotella bivia and other prevotella spp. was 0.5 microg/ml. the mic(90) for fusobacterium nucleatum was 8  microg/ml, and that for fusobacterium mortiferum and fusobacterium varium was >32 microg/ml. the mic(90)s for the bacteroides fragilis group were as follows: for b. fragilis, 8 microg/ml; for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides distasonis, and bacteroides uniformis, >32 microg/ml; and for bacteroides vulgatus, 4 microg/ml. telithromycin mics for the b. fragilis group were usually 1 to 2 dilutions higher than abt-773 mics. for all strains, abt-773  was more active than erythromycin by 4 or more dilutions, and for some strains this drug was more active than clindamycin.

TI  == bacteriology of histopathologically defined appendicitis in children.
AB  == background: acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in childhood. however, the pathogenesis and detailed microbiology are obscure. objective: to determine in detail the bacterial etiology of appendicitis in children in relation to the histologic tissue pathology. study design: tissue samples obtained at surgery from 41 children with suspected acute appendicitis were examined histologically and by culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the patients were analyzed according to histopathologic and clinical findings. results: aerobic and anaerobic species were isolated from 40 of 41 (98%) samples; on average, 14.1 isolates per specimen (10.4 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes). specimens from patients with gangrenous appendices yielded significantly higher numbers of anaerobic isolates per specimen than did specimens from patients with  healthy appendices (11.7 vs. 7.7; p < 0.01). bacteria belonging to the bacteroides fragilis group were the most frequently isolated anaerobic microorganisms (95%). other organisms frequently isolated in all histology groups were peptostreptococcus micros (66%), bilophila wadsworthia (63%), fusobacterium  nucleatum (44%), eggerthella lenta (44%) and a hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing gram-negative rod (41%). of the aerobes escherichia coli (88%) and streptococcus anginosus group (former streptococcus "milleri" group) organisms (61%) were the most frequent findings. conclusions: the shift from histologically normal toward gangrenous appendices was clearly associated with markedly elevated anaerobic bacterial counts in terms of species. the unusually high frequencies of b. wadsworthia (75%) and the hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing gram-negative rod (56%) in gangrenous appendices represent unique and different findings from those reported in adults.

TI  == anaerobic bacteraemia: a review of 17 cases.
AB  == of 93 blood cultures received with a suspicion of anaerobic bacteraemia over a period of two years, only 17 (18.3%) showed anaerobic growth. twelve grew anaerobes alone while five had a polymicrobial flora. seven of these patients (4.3%) had pre-existing heart disease while others had history of prior surgery,  diabetes mellitus or urinary tract infection. oropharynx was the commonest portal of entry, followed by gastrointestinal tract. the anaerobes isolated were anaerobic streptococci, bacteroides fragilis group and bilophila and eubacterium  species. fifteen patients developed major complications such as congestive cardiac failure, systemic embolisation, and perforative peritonitis. the mortality rate among the cases with anaerobic bacteraemia was 23.5% in this study.

TI  == recovery of bilophila wadsworthiafrom clinical specimens in italy.
AB  == this report is the first survey in italy to evaluate the incidence of recovery of bilophila wadsworthia in clinical situations. the survey was carried out at the departments of microbiology in two northern italian hospitals over a one-year period. tests for b. wadsworthia were carried out on a range of specimens from different body sites, when etiology by anaerobes was suspected. out of a total of 350 samples examined, 67% were positive in bacteriological tests. mixed anaerobic infections were detected in 53 specimens, corresponding to 23% of all cases. strains of b. wadsworthia were isolated from 12 samples, equivalent to 5% and 22% of total and mixed/anaerobic infections, respectively. bilophila wadsworthia was  always isolated in mixed infections, mainly from the large intestine (67% of cases). the infectious process of b. wadsworthia was often complicated by abscess formation, regardless of body site. interestingly, a strain was isolated from one case of bacteremia. the microorganisms most frequently isolated with b. wadsworthia were escherichia coli for facultative species (38%), and bacteroides  fragilis, from anaerobic isolates (25%). production of beta-lactamases by b. wadsworthia isolates was found in ten strains (83%), which appeared to be penicillin g resistant at concentration equal to or greater than the break-point  (4 microg/ml). epidemiological and clinical data from this and previous studies point to the involvement of b. wadsworthia in mixed infections. to assess the specific contribution of the species to the disease, studies of pathogenetic factors are to be considered in parallel. nonetheless, production of beta-lactamases by most b. wadsworthia isolates could easily interfere with the therapeutical approach to infections involving the new species. the addition of a selective medium to culture specimens from the abdominal cavity should be considered in order to detect the presence of b. wadsworthia.

TI  == [first isolation of bilophila wadsworthia in otitis externa].
AB  == bilophila wadsworthia is an obligately anaerobic, gram-negative rod, which was first described in 1989. the natural habitat of this species seems to be the lower intestinal tract where it was recovered from about 60% of the persons investigated. bilophila wadsworthia is mainly associated with intra-abdominal infections, but the species was also isolated as part of aerobic-anaerobic mixed  infections at various extra-abdominal sites. otological infections due to bilophila wadsworthia have as yet not been described. in the present paper, we report a case of a patient with postoperative otitis externa following stapedectomy, probably caused by the anaerobes bacteroides fragilis and bilophila wadsworthia.

TI  == bilophila wadsworthiain brain abscess: case report.
AB  == a case of a patient with a 20-year history of chronic otitis media complicated by cholesteatoma and brain abscess is described. a ct scan with contrast material showed three abscess cavities in the right cerebellar hemisphere. a culture from  a specimen of the cholesteatoma yielded a significant amount of growth of bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides fragilis and prevotella oris and a moderate growth of alpha-streptococci and staphylococcus simulans. from the pus of the brain abscess we also isolated numerous bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides fragilis and prevotella oris and some prevotella buccae and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. no aerobes were present. the patient underwent a craniotomy and the biggest abscess was removed together with the capsule. the antimicrobial therapy  included penicillin plus metronidazole and later augmentin. the result of the treatment was a complete cure and total recovery of the patient. this is the first documentation of isolation of b. wadsworthia in chronic otitis media and in brain abscess.

TI  == preliminary study using species-specific oligonucleotide probe for rrna of bilophila wadsworthia.
AB  == portions of the 16s rna from a urease-positive bilophila wadsworthia strain were  sequenced, and a probe was constructed. the probe was end labeled with [32p]atp and polynucleotide kinase and hybridized on a nylon filter (by dot blot hybridization) to the immobilized rrna of 12 b. wadsworthia strains and eight other anaerobic isolates. the probe efficiently hybridized only to the bilophila  strains. cross-reactivity at high rna levels (2,000 ng) was observed with one strain of bacteroides thetaiotamicron and one strain of bacteroides fragilis (with 10x set buffer [20x set buffer is 0.5 m nacl, 0.03 m tris, and 2 mm edta])  but was not seen at lower rna levels or with 5x set buffer. when tested against mixed cultures of aerobic and anaerobic isolates representative of appendiceal abscess flora, the probe did not react with mixed cultures containing no bilophila cells and could detect > or = 10(5) bilophila cfu/ml when the mixture was seeded with bilophila cells. this probe is of potential use in the rapid identification of pure isolates and in the direct identification of b. wadsworthia in clinical specimens.
