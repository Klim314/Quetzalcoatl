effect of lactic acid producing bacteria on the human intestinal microflora during ampicillin treatment.
20 healthy volunteers participated in a double blind study concerning the effect  of lactic acid producing bacteria on the intestinal microflora during ampicillin treatment.
10 volunteers received 500 mg ampicillin tablets t.i.d. together with capsules containing lactic acid producing bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum) for 7 days, and the other 10 volunteers were given 500 mg ampicillin tablets together with placebo capsules t.i.d. for 7 days.
both groups of volunteers continued the intake of the capsules t.i.d. for another 14 days after the ampicillin administration had been completed.
the number of enterococci, streptococci and corynebacteria decreased during ampicillin administration but returned to normal levels after 14 days.
yeasts increased during the antibiotic treatment but returned to the same levels as before treatment within 14 days.
escherichia coli strains were suppressed in most volunteers during ampicillin administration.
the numbers of anaerobic gram-positive cocci and rods decreased in most subjects during ampicillin treatment but were normalized within 2 weeks.
bacteroides strains were recovered in higher numbers in the lactic acid producing bacteria group compared to the placebo group.
the volunteers receiving lactic acid producing bacteria were recolonized slightly faster than those having placebo.
there were adverse effects observed in 3 subjects receiving ampicillin plus placebo. in the lactic acid producing bacteria group, one subject had diarrhoea on day 3 to on day 3 to day 7.
