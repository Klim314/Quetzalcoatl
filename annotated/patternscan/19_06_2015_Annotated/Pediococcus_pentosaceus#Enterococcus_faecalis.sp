TI  == biodiversity and gamma-aminobutyric acid production by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional alpine raw cow's milk cheeses.
AB  == "nostrano-cheeses" are traditional alpine cheeses made from raw cow's milk in trentino-alto adige, italy. this study identified lactic acid bacteria (lab) developing during maturation of "nostrano-cheeses" and evaluated their potential  to produce gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba), an immunologically active compound and neurotransmitter. cheese samples were collected on six cheese-making days, in three dairy factories located in different areas of trentino and at different stages of cheese ripening (24 h, 15 days, and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 months). a total  of 1,059 lab isolates were screened using random amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and differentiated into 583 clusters. lab strains from dominant clusters (n = 97) were genetically identified to species level by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. lab species most frequently isolated were lactobacillus paracasei, streptococcus thermophilus, and leuconostoc mesenteroides. the 97 dominant clusters were also characterized for their ability in producing gaba by  high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). about 71% of the dominant bacteria clusters evolving during cheeses ripening were able to produce gaba. most gaba producers were lactobacillus paracasei but other gaba producing species included  lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, pediococcus pentosaceus, and streptococcus thermophilus. no enterococcus faecalis or sc. macedonicus isolates produced gaba. the isolate producing the highest amount of gaba (80.0+/-2.7 mg/kg) was a sc. thermophilus.

TI  == antibacterial efficacy of nisin, pediocin 34 and enterocin fh99 against l. monocytogenes, e. faecium and e. faecalis and bacteriocin cross resistance and antibiotic susceptibility of their bacteriocin resistant variants.
AB  == the bacteriocin susceptibility of listeria monocytogenes mtcc 657, enterococcus faecium dsmz 20477, e. faecium vre, and e. faecalis atcc 29212 and their corresponding bacteriocin resistant variants was assessed. the single and combined effect of nisin and pediocin 34 and enterocin fh99 bacteriocins produced by pediococcus pentosaceus 34, and e. faecium fh99, respectively, was determined. pediocin34 proved to be more effective in inhibiting l. monocytogenes mtcc 657. a greater antibacterial effect was observed against e. faecium dsmz 20477 and e. faecium (vre) when the a combination of nisin, pediocin 34 and enterocin fh99 were used whereas in case of l. monocytogenes mtcc 657 a combination of pediocin  34 and enterocin fh99 was more effective in reducing the survival of pathogen. bacteriocin cross-resistance and the antibiotic susceptibility of wild type and their corresponding resistant variants were assessed and results showed that resistance to a bacteriocin may extend to other bacteriocins within the same class and also the acquired resistance to bacteriocins can modify the antibiotic  susceptibility/resistance profile of the bacterial species used in the study. according to the hydrophobicity nisin resistant variant of l. monocytogenes was more hydrophobic (p < 0.001), whereas the pediocin 34 and enterocin fh99 resistant variants were less hydrophobic than the wild type strain. nisin, pediocin 34 and enterocin fh99 resistant variants of e. faecium dsmz 20477 and e. faecium vre were less hydrophobic than their wild type counterparts. nisin resistant e. faecalis atcc 29212 was less hydrophobic than its wild type counterpart.

TI  == influence of lactic acid bacteria on redox status and on proteolytic activity of  buckwheat (fagopyrum esculentum moench) sourdoughs.
AB  == redox potential and proteolysis determine protein networks in doughs and thus dough rheology as well as the structure of baked goods. namely, gluten-free bakery products needs structural improvements but little is known about these parameters in gluten free dough systems. in this work the influence of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on redox status and proteolysis of buckwheat sourdoughs was investigated. an increase of free thiol groups was detected as redox potential was decreasing during fermentation. thiol content at 8 h was higher in doughs fermented with strains with high reductive activity, such as weissella (w.) cibaria in comparison to pediococcus (p.) pentosaceus, which exhibited a lower reducing activity. at 24 h each fermentation showed a similar content of free thiol groups. endogenous buckwheat proteases were characterized using various protease inhibitors in buckwheat doughs. until ph3.1 a proteolysis increase was monitored in doughs. employed lab didn't show any detectable extracellular proteolytic activity. flour proteases are thus responsible for protein breakdown, and this was demonstrated comparing free amino nitrogen (fan) values and protein  electrophoretic patterns of sourdough fermentations with chemical acidified (ca)  doughs. fan content at 24 h using p. pentosaceus, proteolytic comparative strain  of enterococcus faecalis, w. cibaria, mixed culture (containing p. pentosaceus and w. cibaria), ca and ca doughs containing glutathione (gsh) reached 45.9+/-1.3, 42.4+/-1.3, 40+/-1, 31+/-2, 29+/-2 and 17.8+/-3.9 mmol kg(-1) flour,  respectively. proteolysis was mainly influenced by ph and incubation time. the addition of gsh showed a decrease of proteolysis and of free amino acids. ca doughs showed a higher total free amino acids content than sourdough fermented with lab indicating their metabolization. fermentations with high fan values exhibited lower band intensity (analyzed under reducing condition) in electrophoretic patterns. these results show that dough proteases are responsible for proteolysis in buckwheat sourdoughs and this activity is influenced from lab  metabolism. moreover, oxidation-reduction potential (orp) changes do not show improvements of proteolytic activity in buckwheat sourdoughs.

TI  == determination of the mode of action of enterolysin a, produced by enterococcus faecalis b9510.
AB  == aim: the current study aimed to visualize the damage caused by enterolysin a to the cells of sensitive strains and to find out cleavage site within the peptidoglycan moiety of bacterial cell walls. methods and results: enterolysin a  produced by a local isolate, enterococcus faecalis b9510 was found to rapidly kill cells of the sensitive strain lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris 2144 during 120 min of treatment as compared to the untreated control where no such effect was observed. transmission electron microscopy of the enterolysin a-treated cells revealed leaking of the cytoplasmic contents ultimately resulting in complete lysis of cell walls. to find the cleavage site, purified cell walls of l. lactis  ssp. cremoris 2144, pediococcus pentosaceus 43201 and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus atcc 11842 were treated with enterolysin a, and liberated amino acids were derivatized for n and c terminals and analysed using thin layer chromatography on silica gel with isopropanol as solvent. the results showed that enterolysin a cleaves the peptide bonds at two locations within peptidoglycan subunits. the first location is between l-alanine and d-glutamic acid of the stem peptide and the other location is between l-lysine of the stem peptide and d-aspartic acid of the interpeptide bridge. conclusions: enterolysin a cleaves the peptide bonds within the stem peptide as well as in the interpeptide bridge of gram-positive bacterial cell walls. this gives a possible reason for the broad spectrum of enterolysin a activity. significance and impact of the study: this is the first report identifying the cleavage site of enterolysin a within the cell walls of sensitive bacteria. this will help in identifying potential applications for enterolysin a.

TI  == antimicrobial activity, antibiotic susceptibility and virulence factors of lactic acid bacteria of aquatic origin intended for use as probiotics in aquaculture.
AB  == background: the microorganisms intended for use as probiotics in aquaculture should exert antimicrobial activity and be regarded as safe not only for the aquatic hosts but also for their surrounding environments and humans. the objective of this work was to investigate the antimicrobial/bacteriocin activity  against fish pathogens, the antibiotic susceptibility, and the prevalence of virulence factors and detrimental enzymatic activities in 99 lactic acid bacteria (lab) (59 enterococci and 40 non-enterococci) isolated from aquatic animals regarded as human food. results: these lab displayed a broad antimicrobial/bacteriocin activity against the main gram-positive and gram-negative fish pathogens. however, particular safety concerns based on antibiotic resistance and virulence factors were identified in the genus enterococcus (86%) (enterococcus faecalis, 100%; e. faecium, 79%). antibiotic resistance was also found in the genera weissella (60%), pediococcus (44%), lactobacillus (33%), but not in leuconostocs and lactococci. antibiotic resistance genes were found in 7.5% of the non-enterococci, including the genera  pediococcus (12.5%) and weissella (6.7%). one strain of both pediococcus pentosaceus and weissella cibaria carried the erythromycin resistance gene mef(a/e), and another two p. pentosaceus strains harboured lnu(a) conferring resistance to lincosamides. gelatinase activity was found in e. faecalis and e. faecium (71 and 11%, respectively), while a low number of e. faecalis (5%) and none e. faecium exerted hemolytic activity. none enterococci and non-enterococci  showed bile deconjugation and mucin degradation abilities, or other detrimental enzymatic activities. conclusions: to our knowledge, this is the first description of mef(a/e) in the genera pediococcus and weissella, and lnu(a) in the genus pediococcus. the in vitro subtractive screening presented in this work  constitutes a valuable strategy for the large-scale preliminary selection of putatively safe lab intended for use as probiotics in aquaculture.

TI  == influence of nacl and nano3 on sinigrin hydrolysis by foodborne bacteria.
AB  == the glucosinolate sinigrin (sng) is converted by endogenous plant myrosinase or by bacterial myrosinase-like activity to form the potent antimicrobial allyl isothiocyanate. in order to use sng as a natural antimicrobial precursor in food, it became important to better understand the ability of bacteria to synthesize the enzyme(s) and understand factors influencing this synthesis at a constant sng concentration. eight spoilage, pathogenic, or starter culture bacteria were grown separately in medium containing individual or combined salts with sng. sng degradation by the bacteria and the formation of its major degradation product, allyl isothiocyanate, were followed for 12 days at 30 or 35 degrees c. the bacterial strains varied in their ability to metabolize sng, and this was enhanced by nacl and/or nano(3). sng hydrolysis took place after 4 days, and the  greatest amount occurred by day 12. at 12 days, escherichia coli o157:h7 showed the greatest capacity to hydrolyze sng (45.3% degradation), followed by staphylococcus carnosus (44.57%), while pseudomonas fluorescens was not active against sng. the ability of tested strains to metabolize sng, in decreasing order, was as follows: escherichia coli o157:h7 > staphylococcus carnosus > staphylococcus aureus > pediococcus pentosaceus > salmonella typhimurium > listeria monocytogenes > enterococcus faecalis > pseudomonas fluorescens.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria isolated from ethnic preserved meat products of the western  himalayas.
AB  == we used culture- and molecular-biology-based methods to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in the ethnic chevon (goat) meat products chartayshya, jamma and arjia of the western himalayas. in six chartayshya, six jamma and four arjia samples, lab were the predominant microbial component involved in the fermentation of these samples, and the total lab population in arjia (7.8 +/- 0.1 log cfu g(-1); mean +/- sd) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in chartayshya (6.9 +/- 0.1 log cfu g(-1)) and jamma (7.5 +/- 0.1 log  cfu g(-1)). we identified 53 lab samples by 16s rrna and phenylalanyl-trna synthase (phes) genes sequencing. the lab isolates were identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, leuconostoc citreum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, pediococcus pentosaceus, and weissella cibaria. these results revealed that there is a high level of diversity of lab in the himalayan ethnic preserved meat products.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic analyses of lactic acid bacteria in local fermented food, breast milk and faeces of mothers and their babies.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are generally accepted as beneficial to the host and their presence is directly influenced by ingestion of fermented food or probiotics. while the intestinal lactic microbiota is well-described knowledge on its routes of inoculation and competitiveness towards selective pressure shaping  the intestinal microbiota is limited. in this study, lab were isolated from faecal samples of breast feeding mothers living in syria, from faeces of their infants, from breast milk as well as from fermented food, typically consumed in syria. a total of 700 isolates were characterized by genetic fingerprinting with  random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) and identified by comparative 16s rdna sequencing and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) analyses. thirty six different species of lactobacillus, enterococcus, streptococcus, weissella and pediococcus were identified. rapd and maldi-tof-ms patterns allowed comparison of the lactic microbiota on species and strain level. whereas some species were unique for one  source, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus brevis were found in all sources. interestingly, identical rapd genotypes of l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis and p. pentosaceus were found in the faeces of mothers, her milk and in faeces of her babies. diversity of rapd types found in food versus human samples suggests the importance of host factors in colonization and individual host specificity, and support the hypothesis that there is a vertical  transfer of intestinal lab from the mother's gut to her milk and through the milk to the infant's gut.

TI  == characterisation and transferability of antibiotic resistance genes from lactic acid bacteria isolated from irish pork and beef abattoirs.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria isolated from irish pork and beef abattoirs were analysed for their susceptibility to antimicrobials. thirty-seven isolates (12 enterococci, 10 lactobacilli, 8 streptococci, 3 lactococci, 2 leuconostoc, and 2  pediococci) were examined for phenotypic resistance using the e-test and their minimum inhibitory concentration to a panel of six antibiotics (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and vancomycin) was recorded. the corresponding genetic determinants responsible were characterised by pcr. also, the transferability of these resistance markers was assessed in filter mating assays. of the 37 isolates, 33 were found to be resistant to one or more antibiotics. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin and chloramphenicol. the erm(b) and msra/b genes were detected among the 11 erythromycin-resistant strains of enterococci, lactobacilli, and streptococci. two tetracycline-resistant strains, lactobacillus plantarum and leuconostoc mesenteroides spp., contained tet(m) and tet(s) genes respectively. intrinsic streptomycin resistance was observed in lactobacilli, streptococci, lactococci and leuconostoc species; none of the common genetic determinants (stra, strb, aada, aade) were identified. four of 10 strains of enterococcus faecium were resistant to vancomycin; however, no corresponding genetic determinants for this  phenotype were identified. enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to vancomycin. l. plantarum, l. mesenteroides and pediococcus pentosaceus were intrinsically resistant to vancomycin. transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants was demonstrated in one strain, wherein the tet(m) gene of l. plantarum (23) isolated from a pork abattoir was transferred to lactococcus lactis bu-2-60 and to e. faecalis jh2-2. this study identified the presence of antibiotic resistance markers in irish meat isolates and, in one example, resistance was conjugally transferred to other lab strains.

TI  == polyphasic taxonomic studies of lactic acid bacteria associated with tunisian fermented meat based on the heterogeneity of the 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic spacer region.
AB  == the objective of this work was to investigate the structure and diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in traditionally fermented meat collected  from different areas of tunisia. a polyphasic study, which involves phenotypic tests and ribosomal dna-based techniques, was used to identify gram-positive and  catalase-negative isolates. pcr amplification of the 16s-23s rdna isr of 102 isolates and other reference lab strains gave (1) one type of rrn operon (m-isr)  for lactococci, (2) two types of rrn operon (s-isr and m-isr) for enterococci, (3) two types of rrn operon (s-isr and l-isr) for lactobacilli, and (4) three pcr amplicons (s-isr, m-isr, and l-isr) obtained for pediococcus spp. and weissella genus. the clustering and comparison of isr-rflp profiles given by the isolates with those given by reference lab strains, allowed their identification as lactococcus lactis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus sanguinicola, enterococcus hawaiiensis, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus alimentarius, pediococcus pentosaceus, and weissella confusa. combined 16s-23s rdna isr and rflp patterns can be considered as a good potential target for a rapid and reliable differentiation between isolates of lab and provided further information on the organization of their rrn operons.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria in two flemish artisan raw milk gouda-type cheeses.
AB  == pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) was used to study the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in two flemish artisan raw milk gouda-type cheeses. in parallel, conventional culturing was performed. isolates were identified using (gtg)(5)-pcr and sequence analysis of 16s rrna and phes genes. discriminant analysis revealed some differences in overall lab diversity between the two batches and between the two cheeses. within each batch, the diversity of 8- and 12-week-old cheeses was relatively similar. conventional isolation mainly revealed the presence of lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus  plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus rhamnosus and pediococcus pentosaceus. pcr-dgge revealed the presence of three species of which no isolates were recovered, i.e. enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus parabuchneri and lactobacillus gallinarum. conversely, not all isolated bacteria were detected by  pcr-dgge. we recommend the integrated use of culture-dependent and -independent approaches to maximally encompass the taxonomic spectrum of lab occurring in gouda-type and other cheeses.

TI  == redox potential to discriminate among species of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == aims: to verify to what degree reducing capacity is a characterizing parameter of a species, and of the strains themselves within a given species, of lactic acid bacteria. methods and results: eighty-eight strains belonging to 10 species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from traditional italian cheeses were studied for their reduction activity: enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis,  lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus and pediococcus pentosaceus. it was observed that the lactococci reached minimum redox potential  before the lactobacilli. the reduction rate of enterococcus spp. and l. lactis ssp. lactis was higher than that of the streptococci and lactobacillus spp. all the p. pentosaceus strains had poor reduction activity compared with the other species. conclusions: the evolution of the redox potential in milk over a time span of 24 h has been found to be a parameter that characterizes a species: the different courses corresponding to the species in question are clearly evident, and interesting differences can also be noted within the same species. significance and impact of the study: the reduction aptitude of strains might be  used to select and adapt appropriate strains for use as starters for dairy products.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

AB  == the effects of treatment with an undefined commercial nurmi-type culture (ntc), cultured cecal contents, and a dual-strain probiotic, containing enterococcus faecalis and pediococcus pentosaceus, on salmonella typhimurium colonization were evaluated in a specific-pathogen-free bird model. two sets of trials were performed, and each study was arranged as a randomized complete block design with three treatments. treatments consisted of (i) control, (ii) commercial ntc, and (iii) cultured cecal contents in the first set of trials and (i) control, (ii) defined probiotic, and (iii) cultured cecal contents in the second set. on day 1, birds were administered 1.2 x 10(7) cfu of the appropriate treatment by oral gavage. on day 3, all birds were challenged with 1 x 10(6) cfu of salmonella typhimurium 29e (nalidixic acid resistant). chicks were asphyxiated with argon gas on day 10, and ceca were aseptically removed. salmonella typhimurium counts (cfu per milliliter of cecal contents) were determined on brilliant green agar containing 30 mg of nalidixic acid per liter, and cfu counts were log transformed prior to analysis. cecal ph and volatile fatty acid concentrations were also determined. data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, and means were compared by tukey's pairwise analysis. commercial ntc and cultured cecal contents treatments resulted in a significant decrease (p < or = 0.05) in salmonella typhimurium 29e colonization, with the ntc offering a higher level of protection. in the second set of trials, the defined probiotic tended to reduce colonization  by salmonella typhimurium (p = 0.07), while chicks treated with cultured cecal contents displayed a significant decrease (p = 0.03) when compared to the negative control. no significant change was observed in cecal ph or in acetate and propionate concentrations; however, a significant increase in butyrate concentrations in both the cultured cecal contents and defined probiotic treatment groups was observed when compared to the control birds. these observations suggest that defined cultures are less effective salmonella control  agents than are preparations generated from the complete cecal microflora.

TI  == development of solution phase hybridisation pcr-elisa for the detection and quantification of enterococcus faecalis and pediococcus pentosaceus in nurmi-type cultures.
AB  == nurmi-type cultures (ntcs), derived from the fermentation of caecal contents of specifically pathogen-free (spf) birds, have been used successfully to control salmonella colonisation in chicks. these cultures are undefined in nature and, consequently, it is difficult to obtain approval from regulatory agencies for their use as direct fed microbials (dfms) for poultry. progress towards the generation of effective defined probiotics requires further knowledge of the composition of these cultures. as such, species-specific, culture-independent quantification methodologies need to be developed to elucidate the concentration  of specific bacterial constituents of ntcs. quantification of specific bacterial  species in such ill-defined complex cultures using conventional culturing methods is inaccurate due to low levels of sensitivity and reproducibility, in addition to slow turnaround times. furthermore, these methods lack selectivity due to the  nature of the accompanying microflora. this study describes the development of a  rapid, sensitive, reliable, reproducible, and species-specific culture-independent, solution phase hybridisation pcr-elisa procedure for the detection and quantification of enterococcus faecalis and pediococcus pentosaceus in ntcs. in this technique, biotin-labelled primers were designed to amplify a species-specific fragment of a marker gene of known copy number, in both species. resulting amplicons were hybridised with a dinitrophenol (dnp)-labelled oligonucleotide probe in solution and were subsequently captured on a streptavidin-coated microtitre plate. the degree of binding was determined by the addition of igg (anti-dnp)-horseradish peroxidase conjugate, which was subsequently visualised using a chromogenic substrate, tetramethylbenzidine. this novel quantitative method was capable of detecting e. faecalis and p. pentosaceus at levels as low as 5 cfu per pcr reaction.

TI  == characterization of mesentericin st99, a bacteriocin produced by leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum st99 isolated from boza.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria isolated from boza, a cereal-fermented beverage from belogratchik, bulgaria, were screened for the production of bacteriocins. with the first screening, 13 of the 52 isolates inhibited the growth of listeria innocua and lactobacillus plantarum. the cell-free supernatant of one of these strains, classified as leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum st99, inhibited the growth of bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, several lactobacillus spp., lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus thermophilus. clostridium spp., carnobacterium spp., l. mesenteroides and gram-negative bacteria were not inhibited. maximum antimicrobial activity, i.e. 6,400 arbitrary units (au)/ml, was recorded in mrs broth after 24 h at 30 degrees c. incubation in the presence of protease iv and pronase e resulted in loss of antimicrobial activity, confirming that growth inhibition was caused by a bacteriocin, designated here as mesentericin st99. no  loss in activity was recorded after treatment with alpha-amylase, sds, tween 20,  tween 80, urea, triton x-100, n-laurylsarcosin, edta and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. mesentericin st99 remained active after 30 min at 121 degrees c and after 2 h of incubation at ph 2 to 12. metabolically active cells of l. innocua treated with mesentericin st99 did not undergo lysis. mesentericin st99 did not adhere to the cell surface of strain st99. precipitation with ammonium sulfate (70% saturation), followed by sep-pack c18 chromatography and reverse-phase hplc on a c18 nucleosil column yielded one antimicrobial peptide.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from aoc salers cheese.
AB  == the objective of this work was to describe the diversity of lactic acid bacteria  in traditional raw milk salers cheeses at the species and strain levels. the characterization of 381 strains isolated during ripening and various strain collections was investigated using physiological analysis and molecular techniques: rep-pcr, species and genus specific amplifications and the sequence analysis of 16s rdna for strain typing and taxonomic identification. the strains  belonged to lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garviae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus millieri, streptococcus macedonicus and pediococcus pentosaceus. a  wide phenotypic and genomic heterogeneity was observed within the different species (lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and leuconostoc mesenteroides) according to the origin and the time of ripening. the natural microflora was different from strain collection and each method must be combined  to identify and characterize natural microflora. this study revealed the low selectivity of selective media used for the isolation of different groups of lactic acid bacteria except the facultatively heterofermentative lactobacilli medium selecting mesophile lactobacilli and sb medium selective for enterococcus. the study reveals, for the first time, the microbial lactic acid bacteria community of salers cheese and its diversity. a better knowledge of microbial flora will be useful to improve understanding of sensory quality of cheeses.

TI  == phylogenetic diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with paddy rice silage  as determined by 16s ribosomal dna analysis.
AB  == a total of 161 low-g+c-content gram-positive bacteria isolated from whole-crop paddy rice silage were classified and subjected to phenotypic and genetic analyses. based on morphological and biochemical characters, these presumptive lactic acid bacterium (lab) isolates were divided into 10 groups that included members of the genera enterococcus, lactobacillus, lactococcus, leuconostoc, pediococcus, and weissella: analysis of the 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) was used to  confirm the presence of the predominant groups indicated by phenotypic analysis and to determine the phylogenetic affiliation of representative strains. the virtually complete 16s rrna gene was pcr amplified and sequenced. the sequences from the various lab isolates showed high degrees of similarity to those of the genbank reference strains (between 98.7 and 99.8%). phylogenetic trees based on the 16s rdna sequence displayed high consistency, with nodes supported by high bootstrap values. with the exception of one species, the genetic data was in agreement with the phenotypic identification. the prevalent lab, predominantly homofermentative (66%), consisted of lactobacillus plantarum (24%), lactococcus lactis (22%), leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (20%), pediococcus acidilactici (11%), lactobacillus brevis (11%), enterococcus faecalis (7%), weissella kimchii  (3%), and pediococcus pentosaceus (2%). the present study, the first to fully document rice-associated lab, showed a very diverse community of lab with a relatively high number of species involved in the fermentation process of paddy rice silage. the comprehensive 16s rdna-based approach to describing lab community structure was valuable in revealing the large diversity of bacteria inhabiting paddy rice silage and enabling the future design of appropriate inoculants aimed at improving its fermentation quality.

TI  == enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  == enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against ent. faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. sake, listeria innocua, propionibacterium acidipropionici, propionibacterium sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium. one of the four pathogenic strains of escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. no  antimicrobial activity was recorded against bacillus cereus, cl. sporogenes, cl.  tyrobutyricum, leuconostoc cremoris, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus carnosus and streptococcus thermophilus. enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees c for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a ph of 1.0-5.0 and ph 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 au ml-1, but increased further to 1600 au ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. the peptide is approximately 3.4 kda in size, as determined after partial purification with amberlite xad-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the mechanism of antimicrobial activity against lact. sake lmg 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.

TI  == conservation of the major cold shock protein in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == primers designed from consensus regions of the major cold shock gene of different bacterial species were used in pcr amplification of lactic acid bacteria (lab). an appropriately-sized pcr product was obtained from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ll43-1 and mg1363; lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris lc10-1, lc11-1, and  lc12-1; streptococcus thermophilus st1-1; enterococcus faecalis ef1-1; lactobacillus acidophilus la1-1; lactobacillus helveticus lh1-1; pediococcus pentosaceus pp1-1; and bifidobacterium animalis ba1-1. the pcr products were cloned and sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequences displayed high sequence similarity with the major cold shock proteins of escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis and the human y-box factor. the amino acid residues of the cold shock domain implicated in nucleic acid binding in several unrelated species were also  highly conserved in the lab strains. it is possible, therefore, that this protein in lab may also act as a transcriptional enhancer to other cold shock genes and/or act as an rna chaperone unwinding tightly folded rna molecules.

TI  == recovery of vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci from pediatric liver transplant recipients.
AB  == between november 1988 and october 1989, 49 first-time pediatric liver transplant  recipients at the children's hospital of pittsburgh were prospectively monitored  for the presence of stool colonization and the development of disease caused by vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci (vrgpc). quantitative stool culturing was done on a weekly basis, and cultures were planted onto a selective medium for vrgpc. isolates for which the mic was greater than or equal to 8 were considered  resistant to vancomycin. patients were monitored clinically for the development of infection, and their charts were systematically reviewed for the use of antibiotics. eighty-six isolates were recovered from 36 of the 49 patients. enterococcal species were isolated from 31 patients and included enterococcus gallinarum (n = 28), e. casseliflavus (n = 14), e. faecium (n = 9), e. faecalis (n = 2), e. mundtii (n = 2), and e. durans (n = 1). stool colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci was noted to increase steadily during the first  month after transplantation. only 9 of 31 patients demonstrated clearance of these organisms in serial repeat cultures. additional isolates of vrgpc included  lactobacillus confusus (n = 13), lactobacillus spp. (n = 12), and pediococcus pentosaceus (n = 4). infection due to vrgpc developed in three patients: a urinary tract infection in two and peritonitis in one. e. faecium was the pathogen in each of these cases. the ranges of mics of vancomycin were 8 to 32 micrograms/ml for all enterococcal isolates and greater than 128 micrograms/ml for lactobacillus and pediococcus isolates. all lactobacillus and pediococcus isolates were resistant to teicoplanin, although they were susceptible to daptomycin. all other isolates were susceptible to both teicoplanin and daptomycin. this study demonstrates that stool colonization with vrgpc may be a common and early finding among pediatric liver transplant recipients. however, infection appears to be uncommon.
