TI  == circulation of a multiresistant, conjugative, inca/c plasmid within the nosocomial providencia stuartii population in the athens area.
AB  == the objective of the study is to report a multidrug-resistant outbreak of providencia stuartii that occurred in inpatients in the athens area in 2012 resulting from a very successful transmissible a/c multidrug-resistant plasmid. thirteen multidrug-resistant p. stuartii clinical isolates from 5 hospitals were  studied. molecular typing was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. antibiotic resistance genes and their genetic surround were detected by pcr and sequencing. plasmid analysis included conjugation experiments using liquid cultures, sizing by s1 digestion, and incompatibility replicon typing by pcr. isolates were grouped into 2 distinct clonal types a and b, exhibiting similarity less than 70%. isolates of type a were recovered from patients hospitalized in 4  different hospitals with no obvious epidemiological linkage, while isolates of type b were recovered from patients treated in a single hospital. both clonal types harbored a conjugative plasmid of 130bp and inca/c replicon type carrying 5 beta-lactamase genes blashv-5, blaveb-1, blavim-1, blaoxa-10, and blatem-1 and aminoglycosides resistant determinants. all beta-lactamase genes were included in stable structures as is26, is1999, and in-e541. the current plasmid seemed to have many common determinants with previously reported plasmids derived from p. stuartii and proteus mirabilis clinical isolates and exhibited the ability to circulate in nosocomial bacterial populations.

TI  == increased incidence of urolithiasis and bacteremia during proteus mirabilis and providencia stuartii coinfection due to synergistic induction of urease activity.
AB  == background: catheter-associated urinary tract infections (cautis) are the most common hospital-acquired infections worldwide and are frequently polymicrobial. the urease-positive species proteus mirabilis and providencia stuartii are two of the leading causes of cautis and commonly co-colonize catheters. these species can also cause urolithiasis and bacteremia. however, the impact of coinfection on these complications has never been addressed experimentally. methods: a mouse model of ascending uti was utilized to determine the impact of coinfection on colonization, urolithiasis, and bacteremia. mice were infected with p. mirabilis  or a urease mutant, p. stuartii, or a combination of these organisms. in vitro experiments were conducted to assess growth dynamics and impact of co-culture on  urease activity. results: coinfection resulted in a bacterial load similar to monospecies infection but with increased incidence of urolithiasis and bacteremia. these complications were urease-dependent as they were not observed during coinfection with a p. mirabilis urease mutant. furthermore, total urease activity was increased during co-culture. conclusions: we conclude that p. mirabilis and p. stuartii coinfection promotes urolithiasis and bacteremia in a urease-dependent manner, at least in part through synergistic induction of urease activity. these data provide a possible explanation for the high incidence of bacteremia resulting from polymicrobial cauti.

TI  == adverse effects of members of the enterobacteriaceae family on boar sperm quality.
AB  == semen samples collected in 2012 from 1785 boars belonging to five different breeds were recruited from the quality control laboratory of magapor sl, spain. these samples came from 43 boar studs and resulted from diluting the ejaculates in commercial semen extenders. evaluation of the semen sample characteristics (color, smell, ph, osmolality, concentration, motility of sperm cells, agglutination, acrosome integrity, short hypoosmotic swelling test, and abnormal  forms) revealed that they met the international standards. the samples were also  tested for the presence of aerobic bacterial contamination. in the present study, 14.73% (n = 263) of the semen samples were contaminated above 3 x 10(2) colony-forming units/ml with at least one type of bacteria. the enterobacteriaceae family was by far the major contaminant, being present in 40.68% of the contaminated samples (n = 107). bacterial strains of the enterobacteriaceae family isolated from boar semen samples were in order of incidence (percentage of the contaminated samples): serratia marcescens (12.55%), klebsiella oxytoca (11.79%), providencia stuartii (9.12%), morganella morganii (3.80%), proteus mirabilis (1.90%), and escherichia coli (1.52%). we have seen that the presence in semen samples of s. marcescens, k. oxytoca, m. morganii, or  p. mirabilis, but not p. stuartii or e. coli, was negatively associated with sperm motility (p < 0.05). the mean sperm concentration (p < 0.05), the mean percentage of spermatozoa with curled tails after the short hypoosmotic swelling  test (p < 0.01), and the incidence of morphologically normal acrosomes (p < 0.05) were also lower in semen samples infected with m. morganii compared with uninfected ones. moreover, p. mirabilis was negatively associated with the presence of abnormal forms. thus, on the basis of the pathological effects that some of these strains may have on boar sperm quality, bacterial contamination should always be examined in semen samples prepared for artificial insemination.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of schinus lentiscifolius (anacardiaceae).
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: schinus lentiscifolius marchand (syn. schinus weinmannifolius engl) is a plant native to rio grande do sul (southern brazil) and has been used in brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. material and methods: the crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, three gram negative bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: candida albicans, candida tropicalis, cryptococcus neoformans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. the isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two gram positive bacteria, namely, bacillus cereus, enterococcus spp, and six gram negative bacteria, namely, burkholderia cepacia, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis. results: the leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of schinus lentiscifolius showed a  broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (mic) against the tested bacteria and fungi. the n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against candida albicans (mic=25 mug/ml), candida tropicalis (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and cryptococcus neoformans, (mic=15.5 mug/ml). from the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of schinus lentiscifolius. conclusion: the antimicrobial activity and some constituents of schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. the results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.

TI  == characterization of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes in enterobacteriaceae clinical strains and characterization of the plasmids implicated in their diffusion.
AB  == a total of 788 clinical enterobacteriaceae were collected to describe the aminoglycoside-modifying genes (ame genes) and to characterize the plasmids that  carry these genes. among the 788 strains collected, 330 (41.8%) were aminoglycoside-resistant: 264 escherichia coli (80%), 33 proteus mirabilis (10%), 10 klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), six k. oxytoca (1.8%), five enterobacter cloacae (1.5%), three morganella morganii (0.9%), three providencia stuartii (0.9%), two  salmonella enterica (0.6%), and one each citrobacter freundii, c. koseri, proteus vulgaris, and shigella sonnei. the most affected aminoglycoside was streptomycin  (92.7%), followed by kanamycin (26.3%), gentamicin (18%), tobramycin (16.9%), netilmicin (3.6%), and amikacin (1.5%). the ame genes found were aph(3'')-ib (65.4%), ant(3'')-ia (37.5%), aph(3')-ia (13.9%), aac(3)-iia (12.4%), aac(6')-ib  (4.2%), ant(2'')-ia (3.6%), and aph(3')-iia (1.2%). thirty-four percent of the strains showed more than one enzyme. the most frequent association was ant(3'')-ia plus aph(3'')-ib (35 strains). from 66 selected ame genes, 24 were plasmid located: 12 aac(3)-iia, six aph(3')-ia, three ant(3'')-ia, two ant(2'')-ia, and one aac(6')-ib. these genes were located in plasmids belonging to incompatibility groups f, fia, fib, or hi2. in conclusion, the ame genes involved in aminoglycoside-clinical resistance were aac(3)-iia, aac(6')-ib, and ant(2'')-ia, genes that confer resistance to tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin.

TI  == comparison of phenotypic and virulence genes characteristics in human and chicken isolates of proteus mirabilis.
AB  == the objective of this work is to compare the phenotypic and virulence genes characteristics in human and chicken isolates of proteus mirabilis. the bacterial examination of 50 livers of individual broilers, marketed by four major outlets,  revealed a high recovery of p. mirabilis (66%), and a low recovery frequency of salmonella spp. (4%), serratia odorifera (2%), citrobacter brakii (2%), and providencia stuartii (2%). the phenotypic biochemical characterization of the recovered 33 chicken isolates of p. mirabilis were compared to 30 human isolates  (23 urinary and six respiratory isolates). the comparison revealed significant differences in the presence of gelatinase enzyme (100% presence in chicken isolates versus 91.3 and 83.3% presence in human urinary and respiratory isolates, respectively, p,0.05). the h(2)s production occurred in 100% of chicken isolates versus 95.6 and 66.7% presence in human urinary and respiratory isolates, respectively, p,0.05). the other 17 biochemical characteristics did not differ significantly among the three groups of isolates (p.0.05). two virulence genes, the mrpa and flil, were having a typical 100% presence in randomly selected isolates of p. mirabilis recovered from chicken livers (n510) versus isolates recovered from urinary (n55) and respiratory specimens of humans (n55) (p.0.05). the average percentage similarity of mrpa gene nucleotide sequence of poultry isolates to human urinary and respiratory isolates was 93.2 and 97.5-%, respectively. the high similarity in phenotypic characteristics, associated with  typical frequency of presence of two virulence genes, and high similarity in sequences of mrpa gene among poultry versus human p. mirabilis isolates justifies future investigations targeting the evaluation of adaptable pathogenicity of avian proteus mirabilis isolates to mammalian hosts.

TI  == genetic features of blandm-1-positive enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == genetic features associated with the bla(ndm-1) gene were investigated in 6 escherichia coli, 7 klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 citrobacter freundii, 1 proteus mirabilis, and 1 providencia stuartii isolate of worldwide origin. clonal diversity was observed for both e. coli and k. pneumoniae. the bla(ndm-1) gene was carried by different plasmid types (inca/c, incf, incl/m, or untypeable) and  was likely chromosome borne in two isolates. the bla(ndm-1) plasmids coharbored a variety of resistance determinants, including beta-lactamase genes, quinolone resistance genes, and 16s rna methylase genes.

TI  == occurrence of gram-negative bacteria in hens' eggs depending on their source and  storage conditions.
AB  == the aim of this study was to analyse the qualitative composition of gram-negative microbes, mainly of the family enterobacteriaceae, including pathogenic bacteria  such as salmonella, in the albumens and yolks and on the shells of hens' eggs, depending on their source and on the temperature and duration of their storage. a total of 375 table eggs were studied, from a large-scale poultry farm, a small-scale poultry farm and a supermarket. each group was divided into 5 subgroups according to the temperature and duration of their storage during the study. two serotypes of bacteria of the genus salmonella were identified: s. enteritidis and s. arizonae. strains of salmonella spp. were also isolated. apart from salmonella and escherichia coli, among the most frequently isolated bacteria of the family enterobacteriaceae were enterobacter spp., klebsiella spp. and citrobacter freundii. qualitative analysis of the bacterial microflora of the eggs also showed the presence of other gram negative bacteria, including acinetobacter spp., pseudomonas spp., tatumella ptyseos, providencia stuartii, serratia liquefaciens, flavimonas oryzihabitans, vibrio metschnikovii, leclercia  adecarboxylata, kluyvera spp., rahnella aquatilis, proteus mirabilis, and achromobacter spp. the study demonstrated that the conditions applied, i.e., the  temperature and duration of storage, did not significantly influence the prevalence of particular species of gram-negative bacteria in the eggs. however,  based on the analysis of contamination of eggs with salmonella depending on their source, it can be concluded that the system in which the hens are housed affects  the risk of contamination of eggs with these pathogens.

TI  == production of biogenic amines "in vitro" in relation to the growth phase by enterobacteriaceae species isolated from traditional sausages.
AB  == histidine, lysine, ornithine and tyrosine decarboxylase activities were tested in 79 strains of enterobacteriaceae (41 of hafnia alvei, 17 of serratia liquefaciens, 5 of enterobacter cloacae, 4 of citrobacter braakii, 2 of proteus vulgaris, 2 of proteus mirabilis, 2 of providencia stuartii, 2 of klebsiella terrigena, 1 of rahnella aquatilis, 1 of salmonella arizonae, 1 of citrobacter youngae and 1 of escherichia coli) isolated from botillo, a spanish traditional sausage. in general, the strains were positive for all four activities, with the  exception of two strains of h. alvei and the e. coli strain, which did not display histidine decarboxylase activity. the strains of p. mirabilis and p. stuartii did not exhibit any of the four activities tested. accumulation of putrescine and cadaverine was studied throughout growth of the 75 strains that displayed ornithine and lysine decarboxylase activities. biogenic amines were produced particularly in the exponential phase, with maximum accumulation occurring after between 12 to 72 h, depending on the biogenic amine and microbial species considered. maximum accumulation of putrescine varied greatly between species and within the same species, and ranged from 18 mg/l in the r. aquatilis  strain to 7325 mg/l in a h. alvei strain. maximum accumulation of cadaverine varied less than that of putrescine, and ranged from 30 mg/l in the r. aquatilis  strain to 1935 mg/l in a s. liquefaciens strain.

TI  == volatiles emitted from eight wound-isolated bacteria differentially attract gravid screwworms (diptera: calliphoridae) to oviposit.
AB  == bovine blood inoculated with bacteria isolated from screwworm [cochliomyia hominivorax (coquerel) (diptera: calliphoridae)]-infested animal wounds was tested as an attractant for oviposition for gravid screwworms. eight species of gram-negative coliform (enterobacteriaceae) bacteria mixed with bovine blood singly or all species combined and incubated for various times produced volatiles that attracted gravid flies in a cage bioassay in varying numbers. in 15-min duration tests, volatiles from five species of bacteria (klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia rettgeri, and providencia stuartii) attracted more females than volatiles of the three species (enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter sakazakii, and serratia liquefaciens). in 1-h duration oviposition tests, volatiles from the substrate using the same five species of bacteria attracted more females to oviposit than the other three species. volatiles from 24-h incubation period elicited least attraction and oviposition whereas volatiles from the 48- and 72-h incubation period resulted in significantly more attraction and oviposition. attraction and oviposition decreased significantly when the substrates were incubated for 96 h. volatiles from substrate with all species of bacteria combined attracted a significantly higher percentage of flies to land and oviposit than those from substrates prepared with single species. it is possible that multiple active chemicals present in volatiles of the all-species substrate may act as synergists resulting in greater response than those observed with volatiles from single-species substrate. before oviposition flies took a bloodmeal from the oviposition substrate. it is possible that the oviposition is moderated by two different factors in screwworm-first, by using a chemical cue to land on a potential oviposition site and second, by using a bloodmeal to stimulate oviposition.

TI  == metallo-beta-lactamases among enterobacteriaceae from routine samples in an italian tertiary-care hospital and long-term care facilities during 2008.
AB  == the emergence of metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae is a serious public health concern. producers have been repeatedly isolated from patients and long-term care facility (ltcf) residents around bolzano, and we sought to assess their prevalence and clinical impact. all routine enterobacteriaceae isolates from a bolzano tertiary-care hospital and associated  long-term care facilities in 2008 (n = 5500) were screened for mbls, with case details reviewed for the source patients. in total, 36 producers were obtained from 29 patients, comprising 14 escherichia coli, six klebsiella pneumoniae, four klebsiella oxytoca, four citrobacter freundii, two enterobacter cloacae and two morganella morganii, as well as single citrobacter amalonaticus, enterobacter aerogenes, providencia stuartii and proteus mirabilis isolates. all were pcr-positive for bla(vim) and 25 were pcr-positive for qnrs; 19 non-k. pneumoniae had bla(shv) and one had bla(ctx-m-group1); 13 were from 12 ltcf residents and 23 were from 17 acute-care patients. all these patients had serious underlying diseases with prolonged hospitalization or ltcf stay; only seven had infections due to the mbl producers, comprising four urinary tract infections, two catheter-related bloodstream infections and one patient with both a surgical site infection and pneumonia. five patients had more than one mbl-producing organism.  pulsed-field gel electrophoresis identified a cluster of six related e. coli, whereas pairs of k. pneumoniae and c. freundii isolates had >85% profile similarity. transformants prepared from two isolates were shown to be pcr-positive for bla(vim), qnrs and bla(shv); their plasmids gave similar restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns, and bla(vim-1), qnrs1 and bla(shv-12) were detected by sequencing.

TI  == identification of a modular pathogenicity island that is widespread among urease-producing uropathogens and shares features with a diverse group of mobile  elements.
AB  == pathogenicity islands (pais) are a specific group of genomic islands that contribute to genomic variability and virulence of bacterial pathogens. using a strain-specific comparative genomic hybridization array, we report the identification of a 94-kb pai, designated icepm1, that is common to proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii, and morganella morganii. these organisms are highly prevalent etiologic agents of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (cauti), the most common hospital acquired infection. icepm1 carries virulence factors that are important for colonization of the urinary tract, including a known toxin (proteus toxic agglutinin) and the high pathogenicity island of yersinia spp. in addition, this pai shares homology and gene organization similar to the pais of other bacterial pathogens, several of which have been classified as mobile integrative and conjugative elements (ices). isolates from this study were cultured from patients with cauti and show identical sequence similarity at  three loci within icepm1, suggesting its transfer between bacterial genera. screening for the presence of icepm1 among p. mirabilis colonizing isolates showed that icepm1 is more prevalent in urine isolates compared to p. mirabilis strains isolated from other body sites (p<0.0001), further suggesting that it contributes to niche specificity and is positively selected for in the urinary tract.

TI  == crystalline bacterial biofilm formation on urinary catheters by urease-producing  urinary tract pathogens: a simple method of control.
AB  == the problem of catheter encrustation stems from infection by urease-producing bacteria. these organisms generate ammonia from urea, elevate the ph of urine and cause crystals of calcium and magnesium phosphates to form in the urine and the biofilm that develops on the catheter. in this study, a laboratory model was used to compare the ability of 12 urease-positive species of urinary tract pathogens to encrust and block catheters. proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and providencia rettgeri were able to raise the urinary ph above 8.3 and produce catheter-blocking crystalline biofilms within 40 h. morganella morganii and staphylococcus aureus elevated the ph of urine to 7.4 and 6.9, respectively, and  caused some crystal deposition in the biofilms but did not block catheters in the 96 h experimental period. isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and providencia stuartii were only capable of raising the ph of urine to a maximum of 6.4 and failed to cause crystal deposition in the biofilm. the most effective way to prevent catheter encrustation was shown to be diluting urine and increasing its citrate concentration. this strategy raises the nucleation ph (ph(n)) at which calcium and magnesium phosphates crystallize from urine. increasing the fluid intake of a healthy volunteer with citrated drinks resulted in urine with a ph(n) of >8.0 in which catheter encrustation was inhibited. it is suggested that this dietary strategy will be an effective means of controlling catheter encrustation, whichever bacterial species is causing the problem.

TI  == evaluation of different laboratory tests for the detection of metallo-beta-lactamase production in enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == objectives: clinical isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae (91), escherichia coli (49), enterobacter spp. (27), proteus mirabilis (17), citrobacter freundii (2), providencia stuartii (3) and serratia spp. (5), with various mics of imipenem, were examined for production of metallo-beta-lactamases (mbls) with different phenotypic laboratory tests that have been previously published to detect mbls in pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. methods: a total of 194 (95 mbl-positive and 99 mbl-negative) clinical isolates with imipenem mics < or = 0.25 to > 256 mg/l were examined. all isolates were evaluated by the double-disc  synergy test (ddst), the combination disc test (cdt), the mbl etest and the modified hodge test. the presence of bla(vim) and bla(imp) genes was evaluated by in situ hybridization with specific probes and was certified by pcr. results: in  30 bla(vim)-positive isolates that exhibited mics of imipenem < or = 4 mg/l, mbl  etest could not be evaluated. cdt with ceftazidime and 1900 or 750 microg of edta, and ddst after applying an imipenem disc 10 mm apart from a disc containing approximately 1900 microg of edta, showed the highest sensitivity (97.9% to 100%) and specificity (87.9% to 96%) rates among the analysed procedures. cdt with imipenem and 1900 microg of edta exhibited a sensitivity of 94.7% and showed very good specificity (98%). conclusions: the cdt with imipenem/imipenem+0.5 m edta or ceftazidime/ceftazidime+0.2 m edta and the ddst with imipenem 10 mm apart from edta are the most effective methods for the detection of mbls in enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == species interactions in mixed-community crystalline biofilms on urinary catheters.
AB  == previous experimental investigations of the crystalline biofilms that colonize and block urinary catheters have focussed on their formation by pure cultures of  proteus mirabilis. in the urine of patients undergoing long-term catheterization, p. mirabilis is commonly found in mixed communities with other urinary tract pathogens. little is known about the effect that the other species have on the rate at which p. mirabilis encrusts catheters. in the present study, a set of data on the nature of the bacterial communities on 106 catheter biofilms has been analysed and it was found that while species such as providencia stuartii and klebsiella pneumoniae were commonly associated with p. mirabilis, when escherichia coli, morganella morganii or enterobacter cloacae were present, p. mirabilis was rarely or never found. the hypothesis that the absence of p. mirabilis from some biofilm communities could be due to its active exclusion by other species has also been examined. experiments in laboratory models showed that co-infection of p. mirabilis with m. morganii, k. pneumoniae or e. coli had  no effect on the ability of p. mirabilis to encrust and block catheters. co-infection with ent. cloacae or pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, significantly  increased the time that catheters took to block (p <0.05). the growth of ent. cloacae, m. morganii, k. pneumoniae or e. coli in the model for 72 h prior to superinfection with p. mirabilis significantly delayed catheter blockage. in the  case of ent. cloacae, for example, the mean time to blockage was extended from 28.7 h to 60.7 h (p < or =0.01). in all cases, however, p. mirabilis was able to  generate alkaline urine, colonize the biofilms, induce crystal formation and block the catheters. the results suggest that although there is a degree of antagonism between p. mirabilis and some of the other urinary tract organisms, the effects are temporary and whatever the pre-existing urinary microbiota, infection with p. mirabilis is thus likely to lead to catheter encrustation and blockage.

TI  == [evaluation of vitek 2 performance for identifying extended spectrum beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae "other than escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella spp"].
AB  == production of beta-lactamases is the main resistance mechanism of gram-negative bacteria against beta-lactam antibiotics. extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) have the ability to hydrolyze a broader spectrum of beta-lactam drugs. hence rapid, accurate detection of this resistance mechanism is extremely important to guide proper patient antimicrobial therapy. these enzymes are most commonly produced by klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli, but may also occur widely in other gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacter spp., proteus spp., morganella morganii, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens and others that also produce other chromosomal and plasmid-mediated enzymes, like ampc beta-lactamases. the main problem is that no clsi (clinical and laboratory standards institute) recommendations exist for esbl detection for enterobacteriaceae other than e. coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella spp and for detecting plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases. we carried out an evaluation of vitek 2 advanced expert system (aes) performance for identifying esbl in enterobacteriaceae, also other than e. coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella spp, comparing results obtained with etest and double disk data. seventy isolates of enterobacteriaceae were tested for the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) by using vitek 2, etest and the double disk method. the use of etest was performed as a gold standard method by comparing interpretation  results of vitek 2 advanced expert system (aes). in comparison with the etest method, aes produced 19 esbl warnings, of which only 5 were classified as major misunderstandings, especially for enterobacteriaceae other than e. coli, proteus  mirabilis and klebsiella spp which produced plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases. the etest, together with the cefoxitin sensibility test, was found to be the best method to confirm esbls and distinguish ampc from esbls.

TI  == rhomboid protease aara mediates quorum-sensing in providencia stuartii by activating tata of the twin-arginine translocase.
AB  == the providencia stuartii aara protein is a member of the rhomboid family of intramembrane serine proteases and is required for the production of an unknown quorum-sensing molecule. in a screen to identify rhomboid-encoding genes from proteus mirabilis, tata was identified as a multicopy suppressor and restored extracellular signal production as well as complementing all other phenotypes of  a prov. stuartii aara mutant. tata is a component of the twin-arginine translocase (tat) protein secretion pathway and likely forms a secretion pore. by contrast, the native tata gene of prov. stuartii in multicopy did not suppress an aara mutation. we find that tata in prov. stuartii has a short n-terminal extension that was atypical of tata proteins from most other bacteria. this extension was proteolytically removed by aara both in vivo and in vitro. a prov.  stuartii tata protein missing the first 7 aa restored the ability to rescue the aara-dependent phenotypes. to verify that loss of the tat system was responsible  for the various phenotypes exhibited by an aara mutant, a tatc-null allele was constructed. the tatc mutant exhibited the same phenotypes as an aara mutant and  was epistatic to aara. these data provide a molecular explanation for the requirement of aara in quorum-sensing and uncover a function for the tat protein  export system in the production of secreted signaling molecules. finally, tata represents a validated natural substrate for a prokaryotic rhomboid protease.

TI  == accelerated detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == a prospective study is carried out to evaluate the performance of a protocol for  the accelerated detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and other gram-negative bacteria. a modified double-disc test (mddt) is incorporated in a gram-negative template for routine susceptibility testing. the mddt identified accurately esbls in all isolates subsequently confirmed as esbl-producers by the  standard clinical laboratory standards institute (clsi) combined disc method. of  1213 isolates tested, 98 (8%) were positive for esbls by mddt and 95 (7.8%) were  positive by the clsi method. esbls were detected in 48 (7.8%) e. coli, 21 (8%) k. pneumoniae, 12 (5.8%) proteus mirabilis, 13 (18.8%) providencia stuartii and four (6.8%) enterobacter cloacae isolates. time required for esbl detection by the mddt method was one day. the protocol described provides a simple, rapid and low-cost method for early detection of esbls in gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == results of a 2003 survey carried out in italy to evaluate the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteria are presented. eleven italian microbiology laboratories investigated 9,076 consecutive nonreplicate isolates (inpatients, 6,850; outpatients, 2,226). esbl screening was performed by mic data analysis. confirmation was obtained using the double-disk synergy test and the combination disk test based on clsi methodology. esbl determinants were investigated by colony blot hybridization and confirmed by sequencing. results were compared to those of the 1999 italian survey (8,015 isolates). the prevalence of esbl producers was 7.4% among isolates from inpatients (in 1999, 6.3%) and 3.5% among outpatients (no data were available for 1999). among hospitalized patients, the most prevalent esbl-positive species was  escherichia coli (klebsiella pneumoniae in 1999). proteus mirabilis was the most  prevalent esbl-positive species among outpatients. in both groups, most esbl-positive pathogens were obtained from urinary tract infections. tem-type esbls were the most prevalent enzymes (45.4%). non-tem, non-shv determinants emerged: ctx-m-type in e. coli and k. pneumoniae, and per-type in p. mirabilis, providencia spp., and e. coli. with the exception of 3/163 p. mirabilis isolates  and 1/44 providencia stuartii isolate (all of which were intermediate for imipenem), carbapenems were active against all esbl-positive enterobacteria. susceptibility to other drugs was as follows: 84.7% for amikacin, 84.4% for piperacillin-tazobactam, 48.0% for gentamicin, and 32.8% for ciprofloxacin. carbapenems appear to be the drug of choice. amikacin and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations represent an alternative in non-life-threatening infections. the appearance of esbl-positive enterobacteria in the community makes it mandatory that family physicians learn how to treat these pathogens.

TI  == clonal occurrences of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli: report from the  meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection surveillance program  in the united states (2004).
AB  == the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection program is a global, longitudinal resistance surveillance network of more than 100 medical centers worldwide monitoring the susceptibility of bacterial pathogens to carbapenems and other broad-spectrum agents. between 1999 and 2004, a total of 10-16 us medical centers referred up to 200 nonduplicate isolates from clinical infections to a central processing laboratory. over this 6-year period, the antimicrobial activity of 12 broad-spectrum agents was assessed against 15990 bacterial isolates using clinical and laboratory standards institute (formerly the national committee for clinical laboratory standards) reference methods. analysis of the mic results by year within organism species and/or organism groups revealed a continued decrease in fluoroquinolone susceptibility (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin), especially among indole-positive proteae (-22.1%), escherichia coli (-17.0%), enterobacter species (-10.0%), and proteus mirabilis (-7.6%) isolates. antibiogram analysis of strains demonstrating multidrug resistance from the same institutions were further characterized by automated ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to determine clonality. in 2004, a total of 165 selected multidrug-resistant (mdr) strains produced 64 different ribotypes with the largest representing 31 escherichia coli isolates from 6 medical centers. other clusters were also identified within single medical centers among enterobacter cloacae (6 strains), providencia stuartii (5 strains), and morganella morganii (4 strains). a significant clonal outbreak encompassing 40 acinetobacter baumannii isolates from 3 centers in a single endemic region was identified in 1999 and has persisted through 2004. continued surveillance of these broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents against mdr pathogens appears warranted to monitor the incidence and spread of resistant clones causing serious infections. possible emergence of resistance mechanisms via clonal dissemination  proves to be among the principle threats that compromise carbapenem therapy, where meropenem maintains the broadest spectrum of coverage.

TI  == effect of triclosan on the development of bacterial biofilms by urinary tract pathogens on urinary catheters.
AB  == objectives: to examine (i) the effect of triclosan on the formation of catheter biofilms by urinary tract pathogens and (ii) the diffusion of triclosan through the retention balloons of urinary catheters. methods: models of the catheterized  bladder were infected with eight different urinary tract pathogens and the effect of triclosan on biofilm formation was assessed by determining the numbers of viable cells colonizing the catheters and by scanning electron microscopy. hplc was used to determine the triclosan concentration in urine draining from models that had been fitted with triclosan-inflated silicone catheters. results: when catheters were inflated with triclosan (10 g/l) the formation of catheter biofilm by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis was prevented. the numbers of enterococcus faecalis and providencia stuartii cells colonizing catheters were also significantly reduced (p<0.05). serratia marcescens, morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, were able to produce extensive catheter biofilms in the presence of triclosan. only p. mirabilis produced alkaline urine and encrusted the catheters. concentrations of 0.02-0.16 mg/l of the biocide were detected in urine draining from the model over the 48 h experimental period. conclusions: triclosan diffused through silicone catheter balloons and produced urinary concentrations that prevented catheter encrustation by p. mirabilis and biofilm formation by several  other common pathogens of the catheterized urinary tract. it had little effect on urease-producing p. aeruginosa, s. marcescens or m. morganii but these species did not produce alkaline urine or crystalline biofilms.

TI  == structure of the o-polysaccharide and serological cross-reactivity of the providencia stuartii o33 lipopolysaccharide containing 4-(n-acetyl-d-aspart-4-yl)amino-4,6-dideoxy-d-glucose.
AB  == the o-polysaccharide of providencia stuartii o33 was obtained by mild acid degradation of the lipopolysaccharide and the following structure of the tetrasaccharide repeating unit was established: -->6)-alpha-d-glcpnac-(1-->4)-alpha-d-galpa-(1-->3)-alpha-d-glcpnac-(1-->3)-beta- d-quip4n(ac-d-asp)-(1-->, where d-qui4n(ac-d-asp) is 4-(n-acetyl-d-aspart-4-yl)amino-4,6-dideoxy-d-glucose. structural studies were performed using sugar and methylation analyses and nmr spectroscopy, including conventional 2d 1h, 1h cosy, tocsy, noesy and 1h, 13c hsqc experiments as well as cosy and noesy experiments in an h2o-d2o mixture to reveal correlations for nh protons. the o-polysaccharide of p. stuartii o33 shares an alpha-d-glcpnac-(1-->3)-beta-d-quip4n(ac-d-asp) epitope with that of proteus mirabilis o38, which seems to be responsible for a marked serological cross-reactivity of anti-p. stuartii o33 serum with the lipopolysaccharide of the latter bacterium. p. stuartii o33 is serologically related also to p. stuartii o4, whose o-polysaccharide contains a lateral beta-d-qui4n(ac-l-asp) residue.

TI  == serological characterization of the o-specific polysaccharide of providencia alcalifaciens o23.
AB  == introduction: the genus providencia belongs to the enterobacteriaceae family and  currently consists of five species: p. alcalifaciens, p. heimbachae, p. rettgerii, p. rustigianii and p. stuartii. the serological classification scheme  of p. alcalifaciens, p. rustigianii and p. stuartii includes 63 o-serogroups and  30 h-serogroups. the o-antigenic specificity is defined by the structure of the o-antigen (o-specific polysaccharide--ops), a part of the lipopolysaccharide (lps, endotoxin), one of the major components of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria and an important virulence factor of these bacteria. among the bacteria of the enterobacteriaceae family, the genus providencia is one of the least studied in respect to its lps structure and antigenic specificity. studies of the chemical structures and the serological specificity of the o-antigens aim at the elucidation of the molecular basis of the serological classification of providencia sp. materials and methods: lps and alkali-treated lps of p. alcalifaciens o23 and serologically related p. rustigianii o14, p. mirabilis o13 and p. myxofaciens as well as o-antiserum against p. alcalifaciens  o23 were used. serological characterization of p. alcalifaciens o23 o-specific polysaccharide was done by use enzyme immunosorbent assay (eia), passive hemolysis test (pht) as well as by inhibition and sodium deoxycholate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (doc-page) of lps and western blot. results and conclusions: the ops of p. alcalifaciens, o23, contains an n-(d-glucuronoyl)-n-[(r)-1-carboxyethyl]-l-lysine residue (glcaalalys). the lps of p. alcalifaciens, o23, and other lpss containing alalys from providencia and proteus strains were tested with rabbit anti-p. alcalifiaciens o23 serum. the serological data showed that a glcaalalys-associated epitope plays a role as an antigenic determinant in the p. alcalifaciens o23 ops and revealed the particular importance of glucuronic acid and the carboxyethyl group for the binding of o23-specific antibodies.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in community and private health care centers.
AB  == in 1999, 39 of 2,599 isolates of the family enterobacteriaceae (1.5%) collected by eight private laboratories in the aquitaine region in france produced an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl). among these were 19 enterobacter aerogenes isolates; 8 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates; 6 escherichia coli isolates; 3 proteus mirabilis isolates; and 1 isolate each of serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and providencia stuartii. esbl producers were isolated from 38 patients, including 33 residents of 11 clinics or nursing homes  and 5 ambulatory patients. seven different esbls were characterized. these mainly consisted of tem-24 (25 isolates) and tem-21 (9 isolates), but tem-15 (2 isolates) and tem-3, tem-19, shv-4, and ctx-m-1 (1 isolate each) were also characterized. seven strains showed the coexistence of different tem- and/or shv-encoding genes, including a new shv-1 variant, shv-44, defined by the substitution r205l previously reported for shv-3 in association with s238g. the epidemiology of the esbl producers was investigated by random amplification of polymorphic dna, typing by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus pcr, analysis of resistance cotransferred with the esbl, and analysis of the restriction profiles of the esbl-encoding plasmids. of the tem-24-expressing strains, 18 were e. aerogenes isolates, including 9 from the same clinic, that were representatives of the epidemic clone disseminating in france. of the tem-21-producing strains that belonged to different species of the family enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis), 8 were isolated in the same nursing home. outbreaks due to strain and/or plasmid dissemination in these clinic and nursing home were demonstrated. the presence of esbl producers in five ambulatory patients probably resulted from nosocomial acquisition. our data highlight the serious need to monitor patients for esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae in general practice.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae in buenos aires, argentina, public hospitals.
AB  == resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins is often associated with plasmid encoded extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl). in order to evaluate the prevalence and diversity of esbls in enterobacteria in our city, a 1-month-period survey was carried out from april to may 2000. extended-spectrum-cephalosporin-resistant strains, isolated from inpatient clinical specimens other than stools, were collected among 17 participating hospitals. from a total of 427 enterobacterial strains that were collected during this period, 39 were extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistant. the national committee for clinical laboratory standards' screening and confirmatory tests for esbl production were performed using cefotaxime and ceftazidime; cefepime and cefepime-clavulanic acid-containing disks were included. beta-lactamases were characterized by isoelectric focusing and pcr amplification using specific primers. three different esbls were detected: shv-related (4 isolates), per-2-type (9 isolates), and ctx-m-2-related (26 isolates). sequencing of the corresponding genes confirmed ctx-m-2 in 19 of 21 and ctx-m-31 (an allelic variant) in the remaining 2 of 21. ctx-m-2 (or its variant) was detected in all escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, and providencia stuartii strains, while per-2 was detected in enterobacter cloacae, e. aerogenes, and klebsiella pneumoniae; shv-related esbl were found only in k. pneumoniae. these results clearly show that ctx-m-2 is the most prevalent esbl produced by enterobacterial species isolated from public hospitals in buenos aires.

TI  == [purple urine bag syndrome].
AB  == introduction: the report of purple discoloration in a urinary drainage system, known as purple urine bag syndrome (p.u.b.s.) is rarely described in the literature. observation: in an 85 year-old woman, with permanent indwelling urinary catheter, the appearance of purple coloration in the urine collecting bag, without change in the colour of the urine, was observed four times in one year. during these different episodes, a gram negative lower urinary infection diagnoses. the germs identified were providencia stuartii and citrobacter koseri. symptoms resolved completely after treatment with ceftriaxone. discussion: the clinical and biological symptoms usually described in cases of p.u.b.s. are observed in the medical history of this elderly woman: indwelling catheter with delay before onset of coloration greater than 15 days following catheterization,  alkaline urinary ph, gram negative lower urinary tract infection. however, during one of the episodes of pubs in our patient, citrobacter koseri was identified, germ not mentioned, as far as we know, in the literature. moreover, in the published cases, proteus species was identified as potentially associated with p.u.b.s., but a proteus mirabilis urinary infection with was diagnosed in our patient, without any purple coloration of the urine in the collection bag.

TI  == characterization of clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae from italy by the bd  phoenix extended-spectrum beta-lactamase detection method.
AB  == production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) is an important mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in enterobacteriaceae: identification of esbls based on phenotypic tests is the strategy most commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories. the phoenix esbl test (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md.) is a recently developed automated system for detection of esbl-producing gram-negative bacteria. an algorithm based on phenotypic responses to a panel of cephalosporins (ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, cefotaxime plus clavulanic acid,  cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone plus clavulanic acid) was used to test 510 clinical  isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus  mirabilis, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, and citrobacter  koseri. of these isolates, 319 were identified as esbl producers, and the remaining 191 were identified as non-esbl producers based on the results of current phenotypic tests. combined use of isoelectric focusing, pcr, and/or dna sequencing demonstrated that 288 isolates possessed bla(tem-1)- and/or bla(shv-1)-derived genes, and 28 had a bla(ctx-m) gene. among the 191 non-esbl-producing isolates, 77 isolates produced an ampc-type enzyme, 110 isolates possessed tem-1, tem-2, or shv-1 beta-lactamases, and the remaining four isolates (all k. oxytoca strains) hyperproduced k1 chromosomal beta-lactamase. the phoenix esbl test system gave positive results for all the 319 esbl-producing isolates and also for two of the four k1-hyperproducing isolates of k. oxytoca. compared with the phenotypic tests and molecular analyses, the phoenix system displayed 100% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity. these findings suggest that the phoenix esbl test can be a rapid and reliable method for laboratory detection of  esbl resistance in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == susceptibility of antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria to biocides: a perspective from the study of catheter biofilms.
AB  == bacteria resistant to both the agents deployed to prevent infections and those used to treat infections would be formidable nosocomial pathogens. the aim of this paper is to review the evidence that gram-negative bacteria resistant to antibiotics and biocides have emerged and been responsible for catheter-associated urinary tract infection. a study of patients undergoing intermittent bladder catheterization revealed that the frequent application of the antiseptic chlorhexidine to the perineal skin prior to the insertion of the catheter was effective against the normal gram-positive skin flora but not against the gram-negative organisms that subsequently colonized this site. organisms such as providencia stuartii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis were repeatedly isolated from the skin of these patients and inevitably went on to cause urinary infections. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of chlorhexidine for many of these strains proved to be 200-800 microg ml(-1) compared with the 10-50 microg ml(-1) recorded for reference strains of gram-negative species. a subsequent survey of over 800 gram-negative isolates from urinary tract infections in patients from both hospitals and the community revealed that chlorhexidine resistance was not a widespread phenomenon, but was restricted to these species and to units where the care of catheterized patients  involved the extensive use of chlorhexidine. analysis of the antibiotic resistance patterns revealed that the chlorhexidine-resistant strains were also multidrug resistant. other clinical studies also reported catheter-associated infections with chlorhexidine- and multidrug-resistant strains of pr. mirabilis when chlorhexidine was being used extensively. this species poses particular problems to the catheterized patient. chlorhexidine thus proved counterproductive in the care of catheters and its use in this context has been largely abandoned.  suggestions of reintroducing this agent in the form of biocide-impregnated catheters should be resisted.

TI  == resistant pathogens in urinary tract infections.
AB  == antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria causing urinary tract infection (uti) has evolved over several decades as antimicrobial exposure has repeatedly been followed by emergence of resistance. older populations in the community, long-term care facilities, or acute care facilities have an increased prevalence  of resistant bacteria isolated from uti. resistant isolates are more frequent in  long-term care populations than the community. resistant isolates include common  uropathogens, such as escherichia coli or proteus mirabilis, and organisms with higher levels of intrinsic resistance, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa or providencia stuartii. isolation of resistant organisms is consistently associated with prior antimicrobial exposure and higher functional impairment. the increased likelihood of resistant bacteria makes it essential that a urine specimen for culture and susceptibility testing be obtained before instituting antimicrobial therapy. therapy for the individual patient must be balanced with the possibility that antimicrobial use will promote further resistance. antimicrobial therapy should be avoided unless there is a clear clinical indication. in particular, asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated with antimicrobials. where symptoms are mild or equivocal, urine culture results should be obtained before initiating therapy. this permits selection of specific therapy for the infecting  organism and avoids empiric, usually broad-spectrum, therapy. where empirical therapy is necessary, prior infecting organisms should be isolated, and recent antimicrobial therapy, as well as regional or facility susceptibility patterns, should be considered in antimicrobial choice. where empirical therapy is used, it should be reassessed 48 to 72 hours after initiation, once pretherapy cultures are available.

AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == new tem variant (tem-92) produced by proteus mirabilis and providencia stuartii isolates.
AB  == the sequences of the bla(tem) genes encoding tem-92 in proteus mirabilis and providencia stuartii isolates were determined and were found to be identical. except for positions 218 (lys-6) and 512 (lys-104), the nucleotide sequence of bla(tem-92) was identical to that of bla(tem-20), including the sequence of the promoter region harboring a 135-bp deletion combined with a g-162-->t substitution. the deduced amino acid sequence of tem-92 differed from that of tem-52 by the presence of a substitution (gln-6-->lys) in the peptide signal.

TI  == molecular characterization of the genera proteus, morganella, and providencia by  ribotyping.
AB  == the so-called proteus-providencia group is constituted at present by three genera and 10 species. several of the recognized species are common opportunistic pathogens for humans and animals. different methods based on the study of phenotypic characters have been used in the past with variable levels of efficiency for typing some species for epidemiological purposes. we have determined the rrna gene restriction patterns (ribotypes) for the type strains of the 10 different species of the genera proteus, morganella, and providencia. visual inspection of ecorv- and hincii-digested dna from the type strains showed  remarkably different patterns for both enzymes, but ecorv provided better differentiation. both endonucleases were retained to study a large number of wild and collection strains belonging to the different species. clinical isolates of proteus mirabilis, proteus penneri, morganella morganii, and providencia heimbachae showed patterns identical or very similar to those of the respective type strains, so that groups of related patterns (ribogroups) were found to correspond to the diverse species. on the contrary, distinct ribogroups were detected within providencia alcalifaciens (two ribogroups with both enzymes), providencia rettgeri (four ribogroups with ecorv and five with hincii), providencia stuartii (two ribogroups with ecorv), providencia rustigianii (two ribogroups with hincii), and proteus vulgaris (two ribogroups with both enzymes). the pattern shown by the ancient p. vulgaris type strain nctc 4175 differed considerably from both p. vulgaris ribogroups as well as from the newly proposed  type strain atcc 29905 and from any other strain in this study, thus confirming its atypical nature. minor differences were frequently observed among patterns of strains belonging to the same ribogroup. these differences were assumed to define ribotypes within each ribogroup. no correlation was observed between ribogroups or ribotypes and biogroups of p. vulgaris, p. alcalifaciens, p. stuartii, and p.  rettgeri. since, not only different species showed different rrna gene restriction patterns, but also different ribogroups and ribotypes have been found in the majority of the species, ribotyping would be a sensitive method for molecular characterization of clinical isolates belonging to the genera proteus,  morganella, and providencia.

TI  == low-level colonization and infection with ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacilli in a skilled nursing facility.
AB  == background: we report a 1-year surveillance study that evaluates colonization and infection with ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacilli (cr gnb) and the relation to quinolone use and other possible risk factors in a proprietary skilled nursing facility (snf) with no history of outbreaks. methods: rectal swabs obtained quarterly were streaked on macconkey agar with ciprofloxacin discs (5 microg) to screen for cr gnb and later were speciated and the antimicrobial susceptibilities were confirmed by standardized disc-diffusion tests. results: the mean prevalence of cr gnb colonization was 2.6% (range 0.9% to 5.3%). the colonization frequency was higher in the last survey than it was in the first survey. cr gnb-colonized strains included pseudomonas species (21%), but more than half were non-pseudomonas enterics such as acinetobacter baumannii (25%), proteus mirabilis (17%), and providencia stuartii (13%). none of the patients who had colonization with cr gnb had subsequent infections with the same species. patients with colonization had more exposure to ciprofloxacin and they were more  likely to have been recently admitted from an acute-care hospital and have decubitus ulcers. during the study period, of 336 patients surveyed, 98 (29%) patients developed suspected infections and cultures were done; the infection rate was 4.7 per 1000 patient days. of these infected patients, 59 (60%) were infected by gnbs; the infection rate was 2.3 per 1000 patient days. nineteen percent of the gnb infections were treated with a quinolone. (overall, quinolones constituted about 17% of antibiotic usage in the snf). only 3 (5%) of the patients infected with gnb were infected with cr gnb, including pseudomonas and providenci a species. the cr gnb infections involved multiple sites, multiple organisms, and long length of stay in the snf. conclusions: the findings indicate that in this community snf, a low frequency of colonization or infection with cr  gnb existed. whether continued moderate use of quinolones will lead to increasing levels of cr gnb will require further study.

TI  == [maggot therapy for gangrene and osteomyelitis].
AB  == 5 patients with diabetic-foot were treated by maggot therapy. the most serious case was in a 75-year-old man who had gangrene and osteomyelitis of the right foot. proteus mirabilis, enterococcus sp., providencia stuartii and staphylococcus spec. (coagulase positive) were isolated from lesions which did not respond to antibiotic therapy. the patient had twice refused amputation but agreed to maggot therapy. larvae of the sheep blowfly phoenicia (lucilia) sericata were used for twice-weekly treatment over a period of 7 months. sterile  larvae were applied to the wound and replaced every 3-4 days. after 4 months of treatment, the necrotic tissue around the toes and on the sole of the foot detached from the healthy tissue. during the last 3 months of treatment the larvae removed the remaining infected tissue. as therapy progressed, new layers of healthy tissue covered the wound. the offensive odor associated with the necrotic tissue and the intense pain in the foot decreased significantly. at the  end of therapy, during which there were no complaints of discomfort, he was able  to walk. in the 4 other patients who had relatively superficial gangrene, the maggots debrided the wounds within 2-4 weeks. thereafter treatment was continued  with antibiotics. maggot therapy can be recommended in cases of intractable gangrene and osteomyelitis, when treatment with antibiotics and surgical debridement have failed.

TI  == the prevalence of gentamicin 2'-n-acetyltransferase in the proteeae and its role  in the o-acetylation of peptidoglycan.
AB  == the prevalence of aac(2')-ia, a gene coding for gentamicin 2'-n-acetyltransferase in providencia stuartii, among species of the proteeae was investigated to determine if it is a common resistance factor and whether the correlation observed in p. stuartii between its expression and the levels of peptidoglycan o-acetylation represents a general feature of bacteria producing this form of modified peptidoglycan. an evaluation of the mics of gentamicin for each of the species of the proteeae did not reveal any apparent relationship between resistance and the degree of o-acetylation of peptidoglycan. the entire aac(2')-ia gene was used as a probe in southern hybridization experiments against genomic dna from each species of the proteeae. a sequence with strong homology to aac(2')-ia was present only in proteus penneri while weak hybridization was also  observed to the restriction digested dna from providencia rettgeri. other bacteria that o-acetylate peptidoglycan were also screened with this probe and a  homologous dna sequence was only found in neisseria subflava. these data suggest  that aac(2')-ia may contribute to the o-acetylation of peptidoglycan in p. stuartii, but a more specific enzyme must also be produced for this function.

TI  == a bifunctional urease enhances survival of pathogenic yersinia enterocolitica and morganella morganii at low ph.
AB  == to infect a susceptible host, the gastrointestinal pathogen yersinia enterocolitica must survive passage through the acid environment of the stomach.  in this study, we showed that y. enterocolitica serotype o8 survives buffered acidic conditions as low as ph 1.5 for long periods of time provided urea is available. acid tolerance required an unusual cytoplasmically located urease that was activated 780-fold by low-ph conditions. acid tolerance of helicobacter species has also been attributed to urease activity, but in that case urease was  not specifically activated by low-ph conditions. a ure mutant strain of y. enterocolitica was constructed which was hypersensitive to acidic conditions when urea was available and, unlike the parental strain, was unable to grow when urea  was the sole nitrogen source. examination of other urease-producing gram-negative bacteria indicated that morganella morganii survives in acidic conditions but escherichia coli 1021, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa do not. consistent with these results, biochemical evidence demonstrated that y. enterocolitica and m. morganii ureases  were activated in vitro by low ph with an unusually low activity optimum of ph 5.5. in whole cells activation occurred as medium values decreased below ph 3.0 for y. enterocolitica and ph 5.5 for m. morganii, suggesting that in vivo activation occurs as a result of cytoplasmic acidification. dna sequence analysis of portions of the m. morganii ure locus showed that the predicted primary structure of the enzyme structural subunits is most similar to those of y. enterocolitica urease. one region of similarity between these two ureases located near the active site is distinct from most other ureases but is present in the urease of lactobacillus fermentum. this region of similarity may be responsible for the unique properties of the y. enterocolitica and m. morganii ureases since  the l. fermentum urease also has been shown to have a low ph optimum for activity.

TI  == the role of o-acetylation in the metabolism of peptidoglycan in providencia stuartii.
AB  == the gentamicin 2'-n-acetyltransferase [ec 2.3.1.59; aac(2')-ia] of providencia stuartii was shown to contribute to the o-acetylation of peptidoglycan and mutants that either under- or overexpress the aac(2')-ia gene was characterized phenotypically to possess either lower or higher levels of peptidoglycan o-acetylation, respectively, compared to the wild-type. these mutants were subjected to scanning electron microscopy. p. stuartii pr100, with 42-44% peptidoglycan o-acetylation compared to 54% for the wild-type, appeared as irregular rods. in direct contrast, strains pr50.lm3 and pr51, with increased levels of peptidoglycan o-acetylation (63 and 65%, respectively), appeared as coccobacilli or chain formers, respectively. zymogram analysis of the autolysins  produced by another member of the closely related proteeae group of bacteria, proteus mirabilis, indicated the presence of three classes of enzymes: one that acts preferentially on native, o-acetylated peptidoglycan, a second that hydrolyses non-o-acetylated peptidoglycan, and a third that is not distinguished  by the two forms of substrate. on the basis of the apparent morphological changes directly related to levels of o-acetylation combined with the presence of different classes of autolysins, a model is proposed that invokes the role of this modification in the control of autolysins for the maintenance of the structure of the peptidoglycan sacculus.

TI  == effect of salicylate on expression of flagella by escherichia coli and proteus, providencia, and pseudomonas spp.
AB  == osmotic stress, salicylate, and mar (multiple antibiotic resistance) mutation are known to block the expression of the ompf porin. since these conditions have also been shown to inhibit the expression of p and cfa fimbriae in escherichia coli, we speculated that they might affect the expression of flagella as well. hyperosmotic conditions have been shown to block the synthesis of flagellin and expression of flagella in e. coli (c. li, c. j. louise, w. shi, and j. adler, j.  bacteriol. 175:2229-2235, 1993). in the current study, sodium salicylate was found to inhibit the motility of e. coli, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia rettgeri, and providencia stuartii in a reversible, concentration-dependent manner. swarming did not occur at 20 mm sodium salicylate. salicylate also blocked the synthesis of flagellin in e. coli. phenotypic mar mutants of e. coli derived from motile strains were amotile. flagella were markedly reduced as determined by scanning electron microscopy when p. mirabilis was grown in broth containing 20 mm salicylate. salicylate had no apparent effect, however, on expression of a 40-kda porin protein in p. mirabilis. this finding suggests that the noted effect of salicylate on proteus spp. may be mediated through a mechanism other than porin production or that the  proteus porin may not be analogous to ompf in e. coli. salicylate decreased the motility of pseudomonas cepacia but had no effect on pseudomonas aeruginosa. the  exact mechanism by which salicylate exerts its effect is not known, but it appears to be related to osmoregulation.

TI  == antibody coated bacteria in urine of patients with recent spinal injury.
AB  == twenty patients with an acute spinal injury were prospectively studied to assess  the clinical importance of antibody coated bacteria (acb) in the urine and the association among the different bacterial species with a positive antibody coated bacteria test. clinical urinary tract infection was associated with a positive acb test on 45% of occasions. three hundred and ninety nine urine samples containing 541 bacterial isolates were assessed for the presence of acb; 13% were found to be positive and 87% negative for acb; 67% of urines contained a single bacterial isolate. pseudomonas aeruginosa was most commonly associated with clinical urinary tract infection, found in 25% of episodes, followed by proteus mirabilis (17.5%), klebsiella sp (12.5%), and proteus morganii (10%). providencia stuartii, however, was most commonly associated with a positive acb test (found in 17%). other bacteria associated with a positive acb test included klebsiella sp (14%), acinetobacter sp (12.5%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12%), citrobacter sp  (11.5%). a positive acb test is not to be expected from a patient with spinal injury who has a catheter in place, and the test may provide a useful guide to identify those patients with an invasive infection. it is doubtful that a decision to treat or not treat bacteriuria could rest on the identification of the bacterial species alone.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of cefodizime: a review.
AB  == for enterobacteriaceae, mic50s and mic90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: escherichia  coli 0.12 and 0.5, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, serratia  marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. the activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. haemophilus spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as n. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic50s and mic90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic50 and mic90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were generally resistant: streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (mic50 and mic90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium perfringens (mic50 and mic90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). these results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.

TI  == in-vitro activity of meropenem against clinical isolates obtained in canada.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, gentamicin and, where appropriate, other antibiotics against recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. mics were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. meropenem inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp., enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens and providencia stuartii at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l and was four- to 16-fold more active than imipenem against these species. against the enteric pathogens salmonella typhi, shigella sonnei, yersinia enterocolitica and  campylobacter jejuni, meropenem was four- to eight-fold more active than imipenem, inhibiting all isolates at less than or equal to 0.03 mg/l. meropenem was also more active than imipenem against haemophilus influenzae (mic90 0.06 mg/l) but had similar activity against the bacteroides fragilis group (mic90 0.25 mg/l), against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 2 mg/l) and against streptococci. imipenem was four-fold more active than meropenem against acinetobacter spp. and  two- to eight-fold more active against all species of staphylococci tested. both  meropenem and imipenem were inactive against ps.

TI  == blockage of urinary catheters: role of microorganisms and constituents of the urine on formation of encrustations.
AB  == long-term indwelling urinary catheters may become blocked in some patients by formation of encrustations made up of aggregated struvite crystals while other patients rarely develop blocked catheters. we have designated these groups as "blockers", "intermediates" or "non-blockers". to further understand this phenomenon we followed 32 catheterized elderly women in a nursing home. catheters were changed six times at 2 week intervals. patients tended to remain as "blockers", "intermediates" or "non-blockers" consistently over time. there were  no significant differences in use of antibiotics, clinical manifestations of urinary infection or fever among the groups. "blockers" were significantly more often colonized with proteus mirabilis and providencia stuartii than "non-blockers", and significantly less often with klebsiella pneumoniae. however, there was no evidence of interference among the organisms. "blockers" excreted a  significantly more alkaline urine, and lesser amounts of magnesium, urea and phosphate in their urine. two "blockers" in whom proteus sp. were eliminated by coincidental antimicrobial therapy converted to "non-blockers". these findings support the concept that "blockers" are patients who have prolonged colonization  with urease producing proteus mirabilis and providencia stuartii.

TI  == proteus mirabilis urease: genetic organization, regulation, and expression of structural genes.
AB  == proteus mirabilis, a cause of serious urinary tract infection, produces urease, an important virulence factor for this species. the enzyme hydrolyzes urea to co2 and nh3, which initiates struvite or apatite stone formation. genes encoding urease were localized on a p. mirabilis chromosomal dna gene bank clone in escherichia coli by deletion analysis, subcloning, bal31 nuclease digestion, transposon tn5 mutagenesis, and in vitro transcription-translation. a region of dna between 4.0 and 5.4 kilobases (kb) in length was necessary for urease activity and was located within an 18.5-kb ecori fragment. the operon was induced by urea and encoded a multimeric, cytoplasmic enzyme comprising subunit polypeptides of 8,000, 10,000, and 73,000 daltons that were encoded by a single polycistronic mrna and transcribed in that order. seventeen urease-negative transposon insertions were isolated that synthesized either none of the structural subunit polypeptides, the 8,000-dalton polypeptide alone, or both the  8,000- and 10,000-dalton subunit polypeptides. the molecular weight of the native enzyme was estimated to be 212,000 by superose-6 chromatography. homologous sequences encoding the urease of providencia stuartii synthesized subunit polypeptides of similar sizes and showed a similar genetic arrangement. however,  restriction maps of the operons from the two species were distinct, indicating significant divergence.

TI  == [evaluation on the capability of indole pyruvic acid production by members of proteeae on different brands of sulfide-indole-motility].
AB  == members of proteeae were vertically inoculated into different brands of sulfide-indole-motility (sim) medium for evaluating the capability of ipa production. a total of 328 clinical strains of tribe proteeae was used as tested  organisms, including 186 proteus mirabilis strains, 62 morganella morganii strains, 31 proteus vulgaris strains, 27 providencia rettgeri strains, 14 providencia stuartii and 8 providencia alcalifaciens strains. seven different brands of sim medium used in this study are kyokuto and eiken from japan; gibco,  difco, scott and bbl from u.s.a.; as well as oxoid from england. the results indicate that sim medium of kyokuto is the most suitable medium for proteus spp.  and providencia spp. to produce ipa (positive rates are 95.4% and 93.0%, respectively) but not for morganella morganii (16.1%). eiken, gibco and bbl sim medium are only good for providencia spp. to produce ipa (positive rates are 95.5%, 85.1% and 87.8%, respectively). take account the tribe proteeae the best sim medium to detect ipa production was from kyokuto (80%) and the worst was oxoid (0.3%). since sim medium can constantly detect the production of h2s, the relationship between h2s and ipa was analyzed. we found that there is no obvious  interaction between these two characters. production of phenylalanine deaminase (pd) is one of the important characters for tribe proteeae. we compared pd and ipa positive rates of each members and found that the ability to produce pd and ipa is almost identical for each member in tribe proteeae except morganella morganii.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == assessment of antiseptic bladder washout procedures using a physical model of the catheterised bladder.
AB  == a simple physical model of the catheterised bladder has been used to assess the activities of antiseptic agents that have been recommended as bladder instillations in the treatment of urinary tract infections in patients with indwelling catheters. the activities of povidone-iodine, phenoxyethanol, chlorhexidine, chlorhexidine supplemented with edta + tris, noxythiolin and neomycin were examined against selected species of uropathogens. except for phenoxyethanol against pv. stuartii and possibly ps. aeruginosa, single applications of these antibacterials for 30 min were not effective in sterilising urine in the artificial bladder. however, a second application 1 h later of phenoxyethanol but not chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine did eradicate ps. aeruginosa. it is suggested that bacteria growing as a film on the bladder wall are particularly resistant to antimicrobials.

TI  == genetic and biochemical diversity of ureases of proteus, providencia, and morganella species isolated from urinary tract infection.
AB  == bacterial urease, particularly from proteus mirabilis, has been implicated as a contributing factor in the formation of urinary and kidney stones, obstruction of urinary catheters, and pyelonephritis. weekly urine specimens (n = 1,135) from 32 patients, residing at two chronic-care facilities, with urinary catheters in place for greater than or equal to 30 days yielded 5,088 phenotypically and serotypically diverse bacterial isolates at greater than or equal to 10(5) cfu/ml. a total of 86% of specimens contained at least one urease-positive species, and 46% of 3,939 gram-negative bacilli were urease positive. for investigation of genetic relatedness of urease determinants, whole-cell dna from  50 urease-positive isolates each of providencia stuartii, providencia rettgeri, p. mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii were hybridized with a urease gene probe derived from within the urease operon of providencia stuartii be2467. the percentage of strains hybridizing with the gene probe was 98 for providencia stuartii, 100 for providencia rettgeri, 70 for p. mirabilis, 2 for m. morganii, and 0 for p. vulgaris. electrophoretic mobilities of ureases from representative isolates revealed nine different patterns among the five species.  the urease gene probe hybridized with fragments of hindiii-digested chromosomal dna from all isolates except m. morganii. fragment sizes differed between species. molecular sizes of the enzymes, determined by sephacryl s-300 chromatography, were found to be 280 kilodaltons (kda) (p. mirabilis), 323 to 337 kda (providencia stuartii, providencia rettgeri, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris), 620  kda (providencia rettgeri), and greater than 700 kda (m. morganii, providencia rettgeri). kms ranged from 0.7 mm urea for m. morganii to 60 mm urea for a p. mirabilis isolate. in general, p. mirabilis ureases demonstrated lower affinities for substrate but hydrolyzed urea at rates 6- to 25-fold faster than did enzymes  from other species, which may explain the frequent association of this species with stone formation.

TI  == the resistance of urinary tract pathogens to chlorhexidine bladder washouts.
AB  == isolates of providencia stuartii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus faecalis from urinary-tract infections in spinally-injured patients together with escherichia coli 10418 were challenged with chlorhexidine (200 mg l-1) in a model of a catheterized bladder under conditions which simulate the bladder washout technique. all species survived the antiseptic. organisms growing on the wall of the bladder model appeared to be particularly resistant and electron microscopy showed that these cells were embedded in a protective glycocalyx. the effect of chlorhexidine bladder washouts on the bacterial flora in the urine of patients was also observed and shown to be minimal and temporary. examination of urinary sediments from patients revealed the presence of micro-colonies of bacteria embedded in a polysaccharide matrix. we conclude that bladder washouts with chlorhexidine are not likely to eliminate  established infections with organisms that occur in patients with indwelling bladder catheters.

TI  == do clinical microbiology laboratories report complete bacteriology in urine from  patients with long-term urinary catheters?
AB  == bacteriuria associated with long-term urinary catheters (those in place for greater than or equal to 30 days) appears to be the most common nosocomial infection in u.s. medical care facilities. this bacteriuria is polymicrobial and  dynamic and accompanied by fevers, catheter obstructions, bacteremias, and deaths. we compared the reporting by our research laboratory of bacteria present  in urine from long-term-catheterized nursing home patients with that by two commercial laboratories. the commercial laboratories isolated significantly fewer bacterial species at 10(5) cfu/ml of urine specimen. organisms well recognized as causes of urinary tract infections in noncatheterized patients (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae) were isolated in comparable frequencies by both the research and commercial laboratories. however, other organisms, including uncommon uropathogens like providencia stuartii and morganella morganii, which were actually among the most frequent bacteriuric species in these long-term-catheterized patients, were isolated significantly less frequently by the commercial laboratories. reasons for the discrepancies are unclear but may involve use of different techniques. more complete reporting may  lead to better understanding of the polymicrobial bacteriuria of long-term catheters and its associated complications. this, in turn, may result in improved patient care and infection control in nursing homes.

(10), pasteurella multocida (1), proteus mirabilis (66), p. vulgaris (4), providencia rettgeri (12), p. stuartii (5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), p. fluorescens (2),  p. maltophila (7), salmonella sp. (1) and serratia marcescens (17). in vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. over 99% of e. coli and enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. all the 118 strains of klebsiella, 87 strains of proteus-providencia and 17 strains of s. marcescens were also susceptible. aztreonam also showed good activity against p.  aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.

TI  == providencia stuartii: a common cause of antibiotic-resistant bacteriuria in patients with long-term indwelling catheters.
AB  == the long-term-catheterized urinary tract may offer a particular niche to providencia stuartii, which is otherwise an uncommon clinical isolate. published  accounts of bacteriuria in patients catheterized for long periods indicate that p. stuartii has often been found as frequently as familiar uropathogens such as escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. as in most nosocomial infections, the frequency of isolation of a given species has  commonly differed among institutions. in the future p. stuartii may be more frequently encountered as a nosocomial pathogen in nursing homes and in acute care hospitals to which bacteriuric patients are transferred. this trend appears  likely because of the increasingly large nursing-home population, the predilection of the bacterium for the long-term-catheterized urinary tract, the opportunity for nosocomial transmission from this reservoir, the resistance of the organism to multiple antibiotics, and the occasional systemic illness and bacteremia caused by p. stuartii.

TI  == [carbenicillin resistance of gram-negative bacteria: incidence, biochemical and genetic determinism].
AB  == of nine hundred ampicillin resistant (amp-r) enterobacteria strains, isolated in  hospital between july and december 1981, 73,7% are also carbenicillin-resistant (carb-r). this particular double resistance varies depending upon the species considered: indole positive proteus (23%), enterobacter cloacae (64%), citrobacter freundii (67%), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (73%), proteus mirabilis  (75%), serratia marcescens (90%), escherichia coli (91%), providencia stuartii (96%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (100%). the biochemical and genetic basis of resistance to beta-lactamines was studied in 27 strains belonging to these 9 species. a constitutive beta-lactamase was found in all the strains. these enzymes were identified by determination of the isoelectric point on crude sonic  extracts, the enzymic activity profile, the inhibition by clavulanic acid and cloxacillin of enzyme activity. two types of enzymes were predominant: tem-1 (20  strains) and tem-2 (7 strains); two strains of klebsiella pneumoniae produced both shv-1 and tem-1. the transfer by conjugation to e. coli k12 of ampicillin and carbenicillin resistance was obtained with 14 strains: (e. coli: 9, c. freundii: 1, k. pneumoniae: 1, e. cloacae: 2, p. stuartii: 1). in all strains but one e. coli we noted the co-transfer of other antibiotic resistance markers.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of current disinfectants for leg bags.
AB  == an in vitro study was performed investigating the bactericidal ability of five common cleaning agents for leg bags against organisms frequently causing urinary  tract infection in spinal cord injured (sci) patients. individual disposable uridrain leg bags were inoculated with urine containing greater than 10(5) colonies/ml of the selected organism. the organisms used were: pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, herellea, and enterococcus. each pair of inoculated bags (one bag for immediate or 0 hour culture and one bag for 24 hour culture) was filled with 30 ml of the test solution, cleaned, drained, and then cultured. the  tested solutions included: plain tap water, 1/4% acetic acid, 3% hydrogen peroxide, sporicidin 1:16 dilution, and 0.06% sodium hypochlorite. the results demonstrated that plain tap water had no effect on reducing the bacterial counts  and that 1/4% acetic acid and 3% hydrogen peroxide had only a marginal effect across the spectrum of organisms. sporicidin and 0.06% sodium hypochlorite exhibited complete bactericidal ability. in the final analysis, 0.06% sodium hypochlorite is the most cost efficient and readily accessible to patients. in practical application, disinfecting daily with 0.06% sodium hypochlorite can decrease external contamination of urinary drainage appliances in sci patients.

AB  == the in-vitro susceptibilities of 198 isolates of precisely identified proteeae species to six quinolone antimicrobials were determined. significant differences  in susceptibility patterns among various proteeae to the quinolones examined were demonstrated. although providencia stuartii was found to be the most resistant to quinolones including the very active agent ciprofloxacin, fully speciated prov. rettgeri were also markedly resistant as well. in contrast prov. alcalifaciens was extremely sensitive to these agents. some strains of proteus penneri were more resistant to the three newer compounds (ciprofloxacin, enoxacin and norfloxacin) than strains of pr. vulgaris suggesting that recognition of this species may be important in surveys of the in-vitro activity of antibiotics. pr.  mirabilis and morganella morganii were very sensitive to the newer agents. the patterns of resistance seen in the three newer agents were reflected in the older agents acrosoxacin and cinoxacin. accurate speciation of proteeae in surveys of susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents is important if misleading results are not to be reported.

TI  == a prospective microbiologic study of bacteriuria in patients with chronic indwelling urethral catheters.
AB  == bacteriuria is common in chronically catheterized patients and is associated with both acute and chronic complications. of 605 consecutive weekly urine specimens from 20 chronically catheterized patients, 98% contained bacteria at high concentrations and 77% were polymicrobial. the mean interval between new episodes of bacteriuria was 1.8 weeks. most species of bacteria caused five to seven new episodes of bacteriuria per 100 weeks of catheterization. even though access to the catheter lumen was similar, the duration of bacteriuric episodes varied greatly by species. of the episodes of bacteriuria caused by nonenterococcal gram-positive cocci, greater than 75% lasted less than one week. mean durations of episodes of bacteriuria due to escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were four to six weeks, whereas those due to providencia stuartii averaged 10 weeks and ranged up to 36 weeks. thus, the very high prevalence of bacteriuria--virtually 100%--was a result of a high incidence caused by many different species combined with the prolonged residence of some gram-negative bacilli in the catheter and urinary tract.

AB  == in vitro tests were performed with sch 21420 and sch 22591 to determine (i) their activity in comparison to six other aminoglycosides against 343 clinical isolates, and (ii) whether synergy with penicillin g could be demonstrated with enterococci. in broth dilution tests, sch 22591 was more active than the seven other aminoglycosides against staphylococcus aureus, enterobacteriaceae, and most nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli. sch 22591 was as active as tobramycin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. the activity of sch 21420 was comparable to gentamicin, sisomicin, netilmicin, and tobramycin but greater than amikacin or kanamycin against s. aureus and most genera of enterobacteriaceae. sch 21420, amikacin, and kanamycin were (i) more active than the other five aminoglycosides  against proteus rettgeri and providencia stuartii, but (ii) less active than the  other five aminoglycosides against neisseria gonorrhoeae, enterococci, most nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli, proteus mirabilis, and proteus morganii. studies on the bactericidal activity of sch 22591 with penicillin indicated a synergistic interaction against enterococci, including strains highly resistant to streptomycin and kanamycin. this could be demonstrated with combinations containing 3.0 to 6.0 mug of sch 22591 per ml and was comparable to that observed with penicillin/gentamicin. penicillin plus sch 21420 (25 mug/ml) also demonstrated synergy against enterococci, including strains highly resistant to streptomycin. however, synergy did not occur against strains highly resistant to  kanamycin. these latter results were similar to those obtained in tests with penicillin/kanamycin.

TI  == intracellular crystalline deposits by bacteria grown in urine from a stone former.
AB  == several species of bacteria were found to form an intracellular crystalline material when grown in urine obtained from a subject with a history of infrequent renal calculi formation. the following species: proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, providencia stuartii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and candida albicans formed crystals of hydroxyapatite. klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus vulgaris produced crystals of calcite -ii. several of these bacteria have been isolated from the kidneys of patients with renal caculi indicationg that microorganisms may be involved in the nucleation process during calculogenesis.

TI  == formation of crystalline deposits by several genera of the family enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == several species of bacteria from the family enterobacteriaceae formed crystalline materials containing calcium when grown in a defined culture medium. enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, citrobacter freundii, and c. intermedius produced calcium pyrophosphate crystals. edwardsiella tarda and escherichia coli formed calcite iii crystals, whereas proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, providencia stuartii, and serratia marcescens produced hydroxyapatite crystals. several of these bacteria have been isolated from the kidneys of patients with kidney stones, indicating that microorganisms may be involved in the enucleation  process of kidney stone formation.

TI  == use of bile-esculin agar for rapid differentiation of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == bile-esculin agar has been used for several years for the presumptive identification of group d streptococci. all members of the enterobacteriaceae family will also grow on this medium, but only certain ones can hydrolyze esculin to 6,7-dihydroxycoumarin, which reacts with iron to produce a characteristic blackening of the medium. one thousand and six cultures from clinical specimens representing 20 genera were isolated and identified. heavy inocula from fresh pure culture isolates on heart infusion agar were placed on bile-esculin agar slants and incubated at 35 c. the slants were examined at 4 h and again at 18 h for esculin hydrolysis. shigella, salmonella, arizona, proteus mirabilis, proteus morganii, providencia alcalifaciens, and providencia stuartii all produced negative results. klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, and serratia rubidaea produced a positive reaction in 4 h. the other  remaining eight genera exhibited varying results. the use of this medium in conjunction with triple sugar iron-lysine iron agar has been of great value in differentiating the klebsiella-enterobacter-serratia group from other enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == esterase zymograms of proteus and providencia.
AB  == the intracellular esterases of 80 strains of proteus and providencia were analysed by the acrylamide-agarose zymogram technique using several synthetic substrates. the esterase bands were classified in five main groups. the alphaa-esterase bands hydrolysed alpha-naphthyl acetate and were resistant or relatively insensitive to di-isofluoropropyl phosphate (dfp). the alphab-esterase band hydrolysed both alpha-naphthyl acetate and alpha-naphthyl butyrate and were  very sensitive to dfp. both groups of esterase bands were inactivated by heat. the betaa- and betab-esterase bands hydrolysed beta-naphthyl acetate and were sensitive to dfp; these were distinguishable by the difference in their relative  activity towards beta-naphthyl butyrate and in their relative stability to heat.  the alpha-beta-esterase bands hydrolysed alpha- and beta-naphthyl acetates and alpha- and beta-naphthyl butyrates; they were inactivated by heat and were sensitive to dfp. the distribution of these esterase bands among the strains of proteus and providencia and their electrophoretic patterns established esterase profile types which correlate with the classification based on traditional bacteriological tests. the degree of inter-strain similarity in esterase pattern  varied highly among species. the homogeneity of proteus mirabilis and especially  of providencia stuartii contrasted with the heterogeneity of other species. this  disparity suggests that the bacteria of the tribe proteae have not the same degree of intra-specific differentiation in physico-chemical properties of esterases.
