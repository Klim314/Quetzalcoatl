TI  == antimicrobial potential of immobilized lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis atcc 11454 against selected bacteria.
AB  == immobilization of living cells of lactic acid bacteria could be an alternative or complementary method of immobilizing organic acids and bacteriocins and inhibit undesirable bacteria in foods. this study evaluated the inhibition potential of immobilized lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis atcc 11454 on selected bacteria by a modified method of the agar spot test. l. lactis was immobilized in calcium alginate (1 to 2%)-whey protein concentrate (0 and 1%) beads. the antimicrobial potential of immobilized l. lactis was evaluated in microbiological media against pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, salmonella, and staphylococcus aureus) or  pseudomonas putida, a natural meat contaminant, and against seven gram-positive bacteria used as indicator strains. results obtained in this study indicated that immobilized l. lactis inhibited the growth of s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus sakei, kocuria varians, and pediococcus acidilactici. only 4 h of incubation at 35 degrees c resulted in a clear inhibition zone around the beads that increased with time. with the addition of 10 mm of a chelating agent (edta) to the media, results showed growth inhibition of e. coli; however, p. putida and salmonella typhi were unaffected by this treatment. these results indicate that immobilized lactic acid bacteria strains can be successfully used to produce nisin and inhibit bacterial  growth in semisolid synthetic media.
