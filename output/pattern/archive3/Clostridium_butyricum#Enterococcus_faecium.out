description of the bacteriocins produced by two strains of enterococcus faecium isolated from italian goat milk.
in this study two strains of enterococcus faecium, m241 and m249, isolated from goat milk, were studied for their capability to produce antibacterial compounds. it was determined that the bacteriocins produced by both strains were active towards listeria monocytogenes and clostridium butyricum, and they did not have any activity with respect to other species of lactic acid bacteria. enterocins a and b were targeted by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and sequenced, after cloning, in both strains. the bacteriocins contained in the cell free supernatants were stable when subjected to treatments at high and low temperatures or with lipase, catalase and alpha-amylase. whereas, the activity was lost when proteinases were used. lastly, a co-culture experiment with l. monocytogenes in skimmed milk was performed. in the presence of the e. faecium strains, the pathogen showed a delay in the growth of about 6h and it reached a maximum counts of about 10(6) colony forming unit, two orders of magnitude low with respect to the control. this result suggests the possibility to use the strains studied as starter cultures to enhance food safety of dairy products.
production and characterization of enterocin 900, a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium bfe 900 from black olives.
enterococcus faecium bfe 900 isolated from black olives produced a bacteriocin termed enterocin 900, which was antagonistic towards lactobacillus sake, clostridium butyricum, enterococci as well as listeria spp. including listeria monocytogenes. enterocin 900 was inactivated by pepsin, alpha-chymotrypsin, proteinase k and trypsin but not by catalase, alpha-amylase, or other non-proteolytic enzymes tested. the bacteriocin was heat stable, retaining activity after heating at 121 degrees c for 15 min. enterocin 900 was active at ph values ranging from 2.0-10.0, with highest activity at ph 6.0. bacteriocin production occurred in the late logarithmic growth phase when culture density was ca. log 8.0 cfu ml-1. enterocin 900 was produced in media with initial ph ranging from 6.0-10.0, but not in media with a ph lower than 6.0. medium composition, especially the concentrations of peptone and yeast extract influenced bacteriocin production, with no bacteriocin being produced in the absence of either of these compounds. no plasmids could be isolated from enterococcus faecium bfe 900, indicating that the gene for bacteriocin activity is located on the chromosome.
