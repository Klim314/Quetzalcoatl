ability of clostridium butyricum to inhibit escherichia coli-induced apoptosis in chicken embryo intestinal cells.
the beneficial effects of clostridium butyricum in the treatment of intestinal inflammatory disorders are well known. however, it is not fully understood how such bacteria inhibit pathogen-induced intestinal diseases. for this purpose, we investigated the effects of c. butyricum and its spent culture supernatants (scs) on escherichia coli (ehec) growth and adherence to chicken embryo intestinal cells (ceics). we also evaluated the potential of c. butyricum to inhibit ehec-induced apoptosis in ceics. c. butyricum and its scs exhibited significant inhibitory activity on ehec growth and adherence to ceics. c. butyricum also showed a significant inhibitory effect on ehec-induced apoptosis by modulating the expression of xiap (x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein), bclxl (b-cell lymphoma-extra large), fas, bcl2 (b-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2), bax (bcl-2-associated x protein), p53 (tumor protein 53) and via inhibition of caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation. these results together indicate that c. butyricum possesses the ability to prevent ehec-induced intestinal disorders both directly, through inhibiting ehec viability, and indirectly, via medicating ehec-induced apoptosis. these observations may help explain the beneficial properties of c. butyricum. furthermore, our data is novel in the case of poultry and the manner in which c. butyricum prevents the ehec-induced apoptosis provides supportive information for the treatment of colibacillosis in poultry.
sequence analysis of a bacteriocinogenic plasmid of clostridium butyricum and expression of the bacteriocin gene in escherichia coli.
a small cryptic plasmid, namely, pcbm588, was obtained from clostridium butyricum miyairi 588 (cbm588)--a bacterium used in probiotics. the complete sequence of pcbm588 was determined. the size of pcbm588 was 8060 bp and the g + c content was 24.3%. nine open reading frames (orfs) were predicted, and orf3 showed significant homologies with a structural bacteriocin gene of clostridium tyrobutyricum. the putative bacteriocin gene was inserted into the pet21d expression vector in frame; it was expressed as a his-tagged recombinant protein in escherichia coli bl21 (de3). a total of 10240au of the recombinant bacteriocin were purified from 100 ml of e. coli culture. the bacteriocin was cleaved into 2 portions, and the small c-terminal polypeptide consisting of 83 amino acids possessed bactericidal activity. these results demonstrated that the orf3 of pcbm588 encoded a bacteriocin, which is identical or very similar to the previously reported butyricin 7423.
