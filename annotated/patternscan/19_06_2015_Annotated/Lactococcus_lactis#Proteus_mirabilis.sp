TI  == intranasal immunisation with recombinant lactococcus lactis displaying either anchored or secreted forms of proteus mirabilis mrpa fimbrial protein confers specific immune response and induces a significant reduction of kidney bacterial  colonisation in mice.
AB  == proteus mirabilis, a common cause of urinary tract infections in humans, can express different fimbriae. mr/p fimbriae may contribute to bacterial colonisation, and its structural protein mrpa represents a promising candidate antigen for mucosal vaccination. commercial complex vaccines have limited, short-lived protection and are incapable of eliciting mucosal responses against putative antigens related to virulence. the development of mucosal live vaccines  using food-grade lactic acid bacterium lactococcus lactis as antigen vehicle is an attractive alternative and a safe vaccination strategy against p. mirabilis infection. here, we report the construction of l. lactis strains modified to produce mrpa via two cellular locations, cell wall-anchored and secreted. protection assays against p. mirabilis infection and evaluation of the immune response generated after immunisation were conducted in a mouse model. mrpa protein was efficiently expressed by l. lactis strain and caused a significant induction of specific serum igg and iga in the animals immunised with l. lactis psec:mrpa and l. lactis pcwa:mrpa respectively. a significant reduction of renal  bacterial colonisation was observed in both groups of mice (p<0.05) after p. mirabilis challenge. this is the first example of a p. mirabilis fimbrial antigen expressed in a food-grade live strain with promising applications in vaccine design.
