TI  - Technological and probiotic potential of BGRA43 a natural isolate of Lactobacillus helveticus.
AB  - Lactobacillus helveticus BGRA43 is a human intestinal isolate showing antimicrobial activity, amongst others, against Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella sonnei, Shigella flexneri, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. BGRA43 produces PrtH proteinase with proteolytic activity on both casein and beta-lactoglobulin (BLG). BGRA43 is able to reduce the allergenicity of BLG. Bioactive peptides released in BGRA43 fermented milk are potent modulators of innate immunity by modulating the production of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-alpha. BGRA43 is able to survive in simulated gastric and intestinal conditions. The growth of BGRA43 in milk results in a fast acidification lowering the milk pH to 4.53 generating mild, homogeneous, and viscous yogurt-like product. The strain BGRA43 grows suitably in pure cow or goat's milk as well as in milk containing inulin or nutrim even when they are used as the sole carbon source. It is suggested that strain BGRA43 could be used as a single-strain culture for the preparation of yogurt-like products from bovine or caprine milk. Overall, L. helveticus BGRA43 could be considered as a potential probiotic candidate with appropriate technological properties attractive for the dairy industry.
TI  - Induction of systemic and mucosal immune response and decrease in Streptococcus pneumoniae colonization by nasal inoculation of mice with recombinant lactic acid bacteria expressing pneumococcal surface antigen A.
AB  - Mucosal epithelia constitute the first barriers to be overcome by pathogens during infection. The induction of protective IgA in this location is important for the prevention of infection and can be achieved through different mucosal immunization strategies. Lactic acid bacteria have been tested in the last few years as live vectors for the delivery of antigens at mucosal sites, with promising results. In this work, Streptococcus pneumoniae PsaA antigen was expressed in different species of lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus helveticus. After nasal inoculation of C57Bl/6 mice, their ability to induce both systemic (IgG in serum) and mucosal (IgA in saliva, nasal and bronchial washes) anti-PsaA antibodies was determined. Immunization with L. lactis MG1363 induced very low levels of IgA and IgG, possibly by the low amount of PsaA expressed in this strain and its short persistence in the nasal mucosa. All three lactobacilli persisted in the nasal mucosa for 3 days and produced a similar amount of PsaA protein (150-250 ng per 10(9) CFU). However, L. plantarum NCDO1193 and L. helveticus ATCC15009 elicited the highest antibody response (IgA and IgG). Vaccination with recombinant lactobacilli but not with recombinant L. lactis led to a decrease in S. pneumoniae recovery from nasal mucosa upon a colonization challenge. Our results confirm that certain Lactobacillus strains have intrinsic properties that make them suitable candidates for mucosal vaccination experiments.
TI  - Characterization of the Lactobacillus helveticus groESL operon.
AB  - This study utilized inverse polymerase chain reactions to characterize a 2.7-kb region of the Lactobacillus helveticus LH212 chromosome that included two complete and one truncated open reading frames (ORFs). Protein homology searches showed that the first two ORFs encoded homologs to the universally conserved heat shock proteins GroES and GroEL. Amino acids encoded by the 5' end of the truncated ORF that was downstream of groEL showed good homology to the amino terminal end of the Streptococcus pneumoniae DNA mismatch repair enzyme HexA. Nucleotide sequence analysis identified a putative transcriptional promoter upstream of groES that was comprised of -35 and -10 hexamers flanked upstream and downstream by copies of the conserved Gram-positive heat shock gene regulatory sequence, CIRCE. A large inverted repeat that may function as a rho-independent transcriptional terminator was located between groEL and the third ORF. Northern hybridization of an LH212 groEL gene fragment to RNA isolated from cells that had been heat shocked at 52 degrees C for 0, 5, 10 or 15 min detected a 2.2-kb transcript in each of the cell preparations. Densitometry showed the concentration of this mRNA species was approximately 4-fold higher after heat shock for 5 or 10 min and 3-fold higher after 15 min of heat shock.
TI  - Characterization of IS1515, a functional insertion sequence in Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - We describe the characterization of a new insertion sequence, IS1515, identified  in the genome of Streptococcus pneumoniae I41R, an unencapsulated mutant isolated many years ago (R. Austrian, H. P. Bernheimer, E. E. B. Smith, and G. T. Mills, J. Exp. Med. 110:585-602, 1959). A copy of this element located in the cap1EI41R gene was sequenced. The 871-bp-long IS1515 element possesses 12-bp perfect inverted repeats and generates a 3-bp target duplication upon insertion. The IS encodes a protein of 271 amino acid residues similar to the putative transposases of other insertion sequences, namely IS1381 from S. pneumoniae, ISL2 from Lactobacillus helveticus, IS702 from the cyanobacterium Calothrix sp. strain PCC 7601, and IS112 from Streptomyces albus G. IS1515 appears to be present in the genome of most type 1 pneumococci in a maximum of 13 copies, although it has also been found in the chromosome of pneumococcal isolates belonging to other serotypes. We have found that the unencapsulated phenotype of strain 141R is the result of both the presence of an IS1515 copy and a frameshift mutation in the cap1EI41R gene. Precise excision of the IS was observed in the type 1 encapsulated transformants isolated in experiments designed to repair the frameshift. These results reveal that IS1515 behaves quite differently from other previously described pneumococcal insertion sequences. Several copies of IS1515 were also able to excise and move to another locations in the chromosome of S. pneumoniae. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a functional IS in pneumococcus.
TI  - Identification and characterization of IS1381, a new insertion sequence in Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - A new insertion sequence (IS1381) was identified in the genome of Streptococcus pneumoniae R6 as an 846-bp segment containing 20-bp terminal inverted repeats and flanked by 7-bp direct repeats. The three sequenced copies of this element have two overlapping open reading frame (ORF) genes named orfA and orfB. However, significant variations between individual copies were found, suggesting that inactivating mutations have occurred in an original single ORF. Accordingly, the consensus IS1381 element derived from the comparison of the three available copies should contain a single ORF sufficient to encode a basic protein of 267 amino acids which exhibited high similarity to the putative transposases of ISL2 from Lactobacillus helveticus and of IS702 from the cyanobacterium Calothrix sp. strain PCC 7601. A minimum of five to seven copies were detected by hybridization experiments in the R6 genome. In remarkable contrast with the two previously reported pneumococcal insertion sequences, several copies of IS1381 have been detected in all of the clinical isolates tested so far. Interestingly, Streptococcus oralis NCTC 11427 (type strain), a close relative of pneumococcus, does not contain this element, but its occurrence in the type strain of Streptococcus mitis (NCTC 12261) suggests that this species has exchanged DNA with S. pneumoniae directly or through an intermediate species.
