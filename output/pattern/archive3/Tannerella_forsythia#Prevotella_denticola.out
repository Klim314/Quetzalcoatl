effects of adjunctive daily phototherapy on chronic periodontitis: a randomized single-blind controlled trial.
purpose: the purpose of this randomized single-blind controlled trial was to elucidate the clinical and antimicrobial effects of daily phototherapy (pt) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (srp) in patients with chronic periodontitis. methods: the study was conducted from december 2013 to may 2014 at ewha womans university mokdong hospital, seoul, korea. forty-one patients with mild to moderate chronic periodontitis were randomly divided into two therapeutic groups in a 1:1 ratio: srp+pt and srp (control) groups. all participants underwent full-mouth srp. pt was performed thrice a day for a month by using electric toothbrushes with embedded light-emitting diodes. plaque index, gingival index, probing pocket depth (ppd), clinical attachment level (cal), and bleeding on probing were assessed before (baseline) and four weeks after (follow-up) the treatment. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus levels were detected by a real-time polymerase chain reaction at the same points in time. results: the clinical parameters improved in both the groups. at the follow-up assessment, ppd was significantly decreased in the srp+pt group (p=0.00). further, ppd and cal showed significantly greater changes in the srp+pt group than in the srp group (ppd, p=0.03; cal, p=0.04). p. gingivalis and t. forsythia levels decreased in this group, but no significant intergroup differences were noted. conclusions: adjunctive pt seems to have clinical benefits, but evidence of its antimicrobial effects is not sufficient. long-term studies are necessary to develop the most effective pt protocol and compare the effectiveness of pt with and without exogenous photosensitizers.
efficacy of amoxicillin and metronidazole combination for the management of generalized aggressive periodontitis.
background: the aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of metronidazole-amoxicillin combination on clinical and microbiologic parameters in patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis. methods: twenty-eight patients were randomly included. the test group (n = 12) received amoxicillin-metronidazole combination and scaling and root planing; the control group (n = 16) received scaling and root planing alone. in addition to the clinical examinations, subgingival plaque samples were analyzed for total cultivable bacteria and the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella pallens, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) using polymerase chain reaction. results: all clinical parameters improved significantly compared to baseline (p <0.05) in both groups. there was a statistically significant reduction of pockets and clinical attachment gain in the combined group compared to the control group (p <0.05). total counts of bacteria also decreased significantly at 3 and 6 months in both groups (p <0.05). t. denticola and t. forsythia were the most prevalent bacteria throughout the study. t. denticola showed a continuous decrease over 6 months in the test group, whereas no change was seen in the control group beyond 3 months. p. gingivalis decreased significantly at 3 months (p <0.05), whereas t. forsythia was the only pathogen decreased below detection limits by the combination therapy with a significant difference compared to the control group (p <0.05). conclusions: the results from this study suggest that combined amoxicillin and metronidazole use as an adjunct to scaling and root planing leads to better clinical healing compared to mechanical treatment alone. the polypharmaceutical approach used results in a significant and substantial decrease in t. forsythia and prevents its recolonization for 6 months, suggesting that t. forsythia may determine the long-term stability of periodontal treatment outcomes.
