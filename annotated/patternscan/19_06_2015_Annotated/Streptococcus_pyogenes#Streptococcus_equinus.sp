TI  == a study on the nature of association between demodex mites and bacteria involved  in skin and meibomian gland lesions of demodectic mange in cattle.
AB  == the nature of association between demodex mites and bacteria involved in bovine demodectic mange lesions and the normal flora inhabiting the skin of noninfected  animals was investigated. demodex bovis and d. ghanensis mites were isolated from the infected purulent material extracted from skin and meibomian gland lesions, respectively. the mites could not be demonstrated in skin brushings or impression smears from the eyes of noninfected cattle. pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes (group a)) and opportunistic organisms (proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and trueperella pyogenes) were isolated from skin lesions of demodectic mange, and moraxella bovis and staphylococcus aureus were isolated from meibomian gland lesions. bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes (group a) were isolated from skin brushings from noninfected cattle. the nature of association between demodex mites and bacteria in demodectic mange lesions is synergistic and of equal significance. pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria facilitated the establishment of demodex mites in the lesions produced and provided an excellent  microclimate for the mites to propagate and reproduce, resulting in severe and progressive disease. the "high-turnover" granulomatous reaction which characterized the histopathological changes proved that demodex mites and associated bacteria were persistent and immunogenic.

TI  == effects of pathogen-specific clinical mastitis on probability of conception in holstein dairy cows.
AB  == the objective of this study was to estimate the effects of pathogen-specific clinical mastitis (cm), occurring in different weekly intervals before or after artificial insemination (ai), on the probability of conception in holstein cows.  clinical mastitis occurring in weekly intervals from 6 wk before until 6 wk after ai was modeled. the first 4 ai in a cow's lactation were included. the following  categories of pathogens were studied: streptococcus spp. (comprising streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, and other streptococcus spp.);  staphylococcus aureus; coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns); escherichia coli;  klebsiella spp.; cases with cm signs but no bacterial growth (above the level that can be detected from our microbiological procedures) observed in the culture sample and cases with contamination (>/= 3 pathogens in the sample); and other pathogens [including citrobacter, yeasts, trueperella pyogenes, gram-negative bacilli (i.e., gram-negative organisms other than e. coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter, and citrobacter), corynebacterium bovis, corynebacterium spp., pasteurella, enterococcus, pseudomonas, mycoplasma, prototheca, and others]. other factors included in the model were parity (1, 2, 3, 4 and higher), season of ai (winter, spring, summer, autumn), day in lactation of first ai, farm, and other non-cm diseases (retained placenta, metritis, ketosis, displaced abomasum). data from 90,271 ai in 39,361 lactations in 20,328 cows collected from 2003/2004  to 2011 from 5 new york state dairy farms were analyzed in a generalized linear mixed model with a poisson distribution. the largest reductions in probability of conception were associated with cm occurring in the week before ai or in the 2 wk following ai. escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. had the greatest adverse effects on probability of conception. the probability of conception for a cow with any combination of characteristics may be calculated based on the parameter  estimates. these findings may be helpful to farmers in assessing reproduction in  their dairy cows for more effective cow management.

TI  == pathogen-specific effects on milk yield in repeated clinical mastitis episodes in holstein dairy cows.
AB  == the objective of this study was to estimate the effects of clinical mastitis (cm) cases due to different pathogens on milk yield in holstein cows. the first 3 cm cases in a cow's lactation were modeled. eight categories of pathogens were included: streptococcus spp.; staphylococcus aureus; coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns); escherichia coli; klebsiella spp.; cases with cm signs but no bacterial growth (above the level detectable by our microbiological procedures) observed in the culture sample, and cases with contamination (>/= 3 pathogens in the sample); other pathogens that may be treated with antibiotics (included citrobacter, corynebacterium bovis, enterobacter, enterococcus, pasteurella, pseudomonas; "other treatable"); and other pathogens not successfully treated with antibiotics (trueperella pyogenes, mycoplasma, prototheca, yeasts; "other not treatable"). data from 38,276 lactations in cows from 5 new york state dairy herds, collected from 2003-2004 until 2011, were analyzed. mixed models with an autoregressive correlation structure (to account for correlation among the repeated measures of milk yield within a lactation) were estimated. primiparous (lactation 1) and multiparous (lactations 2 and 3) cows were analyzed separately, as the shapes of their lactation curves differed.  primiparas were followed for up to 48 wk of lactation and multiparas for up to 44 wk. fixed effects included parity, calving season, week of lactation, cm (type, case number, and timing of cm in relation to milk production cycle), and other diseases (milk fever, retained placenta, metritis, ketosis, displaced abomasum).  herd was modeled as a random effect. clinical mastitis was more common in multiparas than in primiparas. in primiparas, streptococcus spp. occurred most frequently as the first case. in multiparas, e. coli was most common as the first case. in subsequent cases, cm cases with no specific growth or contamination were most common in both parity groups. the hazard of cm increased with case number. mastitic cows were generally higher producers before the cm episode than their nonmastitic herdmates. milk loss varied with pathogen and case number. in primiparas, the greatest losses were associated with e. coli and "other not treatable" organisms. in multiparas, the greatest losses were associated with klebsiella spp. and "other not treatable" organisms. milk loss was not associated with occurrence of cns. the findings may help farmers to make optimal management  decisions for their cows.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == milk haptoglobin, milk amyloid a, and n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase activity in bovines with naturally occurring clinical mastitis diagnosed with a quantitative  pcr test.
AB  == the associations between quantitative bacteriological results from a real-time pcr test and concentrations of acute-phase proteins (app) and n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (nagase) activity in milk in naturally occurring  clinical mastitis were investigated. milk app concentrations and nagase activity  in clinical mastitis caused by different udder pathogens were studied. the associations between the severity of the clinical signs and concentrations of app and nagase activity were estimated. milk samples from 281 cases of clinical mastitis were collected from 3 estonian dairy farms and analyzed by pcr to identify pathogens. twenty-seven samples out of 281 (9.6%) were pcr negative. milk samples containing 4 or more bacterial species (n=28) were considered possibly contaminated and excluded from all further analyses. in total, 443 bacterial identifications were made from the remaining 226 milk samples. a single bacterial species was detected in 68 samples (30.1%), 2 species were detected in  99 samples (43.8%), and 3 species were detected in 59 (26.1%) samples. to determine the inflammatory response in the udder, the concentrations of milk amyloid a (maa) and haptoglobin (hp) and nagase activity in the milk were analyzed. a significant positive association was found between the severity of the clinical signs and inflammatory markers in the milk. milk amyloid a and hp concentrations and nagase activity were significantly higher in samples with large quantities of bacterial dna from escherichia coli or streptococcus dysgalactiae compared with milk samples not containing those species. large quantities of bacterial dna from trueperella pyogenes or streptococcus uberis in  the milk were associated with elevated concentrations of hp and high nagase activity, but not with increased maa concentrations. milk samples containing corynebacterium bovis and coagulase-negative staphylococci had significantly lower concentrations of maa and hp and lower nagase activity compared with samples where these species were not detected. it can be concluded that concentrations of app and nagase activity in the milk were associated with the quantity of bacterial dna in the milk samples.

TI  == competence for natural genetic transformation in the streptococcus bovis group streptococci s. infantarius and s. macedonicus.
AB  == natural genetic transformation is common among many species of the genus streptococcus, but it has never, or rarely, been reported for the streptococcus pyogenes and s. bovis groups of species, even though many streptococcal competence genes and the competence regulators sigx, comr, and coms are well conserved in both groups. to explore the incidence of competence in the s. bovis  group, 25 isolates of s. infantarius and s. macedonicus were surveyed by employing culture in chemically defined media devoid of peptide nutrients and treatment with synthetic candidate pheromone peptides predicted from the sequence of the gene coms. approximately half of strains examined were transformable, many transforming at high rates comparable to those for the well-characterized streptococcal natural transformation systems. in s. infantarius, nanomolar amounts of the synthetic pheromone ltawwgl induced robust but transient competence in high-density cultures, but mutation of the comrs locus abolished transformation. we conclude that at least these two species of the s. bovis group retain a robust system of natural transformation regulated by a comrs pheromone circuit and the alternative sigma factor sigx and infer that transformation is even more common among the streptococci than has been recognized. the tools presented here will facilitate targeted genetic manipulation in this group of streptococci.

TI  == mastitis diagnosis in dairy cows using pathoproof real-time polymerase chain reaction assay in comparison with conventional bacterial culture in a northern german field study.
AB  == in the following field study, the commercial pathoproof mastitis pcr assay, a real-time pcr for identifying eleven mastitis pathogens and the staphylococcal beta-lactamase gene, was compared with conventional bacterial culture. for this purpose, 681 udder quarter samples from 173 clinically healthy cows with varying  somatic cell count from four dairy herds in the region of osnabruck, lower saxony, germany, were collected between july 2010 and february 2011 and subjected to pcr and bacterial culture. the frequency of positive pathogen signals was markedly higher with pcr compared with culture (70.6% vs. 32.2%). this was accompanied by a substantial higher percentage of multiple pathogen identifications and a lower percentage of single identifications in the pcr compared with bacterial culture. using bacterial culture as gold standard, moderate to high sensitivities (76.9-100%) and specificities (63.3-98.7%) were calculated for six out of seven pathogens with sufficient detection numbers. for  enterococcus spp, the sensitivity was only 9.1%. when the pcr results of pooled udder quarter samples of the 173 cows were compared with the single udder quarter samples, in 72% of the cases, major pathogen dna was either not found in both types of samples, or in the case of a positive pool sample, the respective pathogens were found in at least one udder quarter sample. with both methods, the most frequently detected mastitis pathogens were coryneform bacteria (pcr: corynebacterium bovis), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) and staphylococcus (s.) aureus, followed by arcanobacterium pyogenes/peptoniphilus indolicus with pcr, and then with both methods, streptococcus uberis. the staphylococcal beta-lactamase gene was found in 27.7% of the s. aureus and in 37.0% of the cns identifications.

TI  == trial watch: experimental toll-like receptor agonists for cancer therapy.
AB  == toll-like receptors (tlrs) are prototypic pattern recognition receptors (prrs) best known for their ability to activate the innate immune system in response to  conserved microbial components such as lipopolysaccharide and double-stranded rna. accumulating evidence indicates that the function of tlrs is not restricted  to the elicitation of innate immune responses against invading pathogens. tlrs have indeed been shown to participate in tissue repair and injury-induced regeneration as well as in adaptive immune responses against cancer. in particular, tlr4 signaling appears to be required for the efficient processing and cross-presentation of cell-associated tumor antigens by dendritic cells, which de facto underlie optimal therapeutic responses to some anticancer drugs. thus, tlrs constitute prominent therapeutic targets for the activation/intensification of anticancer immune responses. in line with this notion, long-used preparations such as the coley toxin (a mixture of killed streptococcus pyogenes and serratia marcescens bacteria) and the bacillus calmette-guerin (bcg, an attenuated strain of mycobacterium bovis originally developed as a vaccine against tuberculosis), both of which have been associated  with consistent anticancer responses, potently activate tlr2 and tlr4 signaling.  today, besides bcg, only one tlr agonist is fda-approved for therapeutic use in cancer patients: imiquimod. in this trial watch, we will briefly present the role of tlrs in innate and cognate immunity and discuss the progress of clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of experimental tlr agonists as immunostimulatory agents for oncological indications.

TI  == the cryptic competence pathway in streptococcus pyogenes is controlled by a peptide pheromone.
AB  == horizontal gene transfer is an important means of bacterial evolution that is facilitated by transduction, conjugation, and natural genetic transformation. transformation occurs after bacterial cells enter a state of competence, where naked dna is acquired from the extracellular environment. induction of the competent state relies on signals that activate master regulators, causing the expression of genes involved in dna uptake, processing, and recombination. all streptococcal species contain the master regulator sigx and sigx-dependent effector genes required for natural genetic transformation; however, not all streptococcal species have been shown to be naturally competent. we recently demonstrated that competence development in streptococcus mutans requires the type ii comrs quorum-sensing circuit, comprising an rgg transcriptional activator and a novel peptide pheromone (l. mashburn-warren, d. a. morrison, and m. j. federle, mol. microbiol. 78:589-606, 2010). the type ii comrs system is shared by the pyogenic, mutans, and bovis streptococci, including the clinically relevant pathogen streptococcus pyogenes. here, we describe the activation of sigx by a small-peptide pheromone and an rgg regulator of the type ii comrs class. we confirm previous reports that sigx is functional and able to activate sigx-dependent gene expression within the competence regulon, and that sigx stability is influenced by the cytoplasmic protease clpp. genomic analyses of available s. pyogenes genomes revealed the presence of intact genes within the competence regulon. while this is the first report to show natural induction of sigx, s. pyogenes remained nontransformable under laboratory conditions. using radiolabeled dna, we demonstrate that transformation is blocked at the stage of dna uptake.

TI  == rapid identification of bovine mastitis pathogens by high-resolution melt analysis of 16s rdna sequences.
AB  == accurate identification of mastitis pathogens is often compromised when using conventional culture-based methods. here, we report a novel, rapid assay tested for speciation of bacterial mastitis pathogens using high-resolution melt analysis (hrma) of 16s rdna sequences. real-time pcr amplification of 16s rrna gene fragment, spanning the variable region v5 and v6 was performed with a resulting amplicon of 290bp. first, a library was generated of melt curves of 9 common pathogens that are implicated in bovine mastitis. six of the isolates, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus  uberis, staphylococcus aureus and mycoplasma bovis, were type strains while the other 3, arcanobacterium pyogenes, corynebacterium bovis and streptococcus dysgalactiae, were bovine mastitis field isolates. four of the type strains, e. coli, s. agalactiae, k. pneumoniae and s. aureus, were found to be of human origin, while the other 3 type strains were isolated from bovine infections. secondly, the melt curves and corresponding amplicon sequences of a. pyogenes, e. coli, s. agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae, k. pneumoniae, s. uberis and s. aureus were compared with 10 bovine mastitis field isolates of each pathogen. based on the distinct differences in melt curves and sequences between human and bovine isolates of e. coli and k. pneumoniae, it was deemed necessary to select a set of bovine strains for these pathogens to be used as reference strains in the hrma. next, the hrma was validated by three interpreters analyzing the differential clustering pattern of melt curves of 60 bacterial cultures obtained from mastitis milk samples. the three test interpreters were blinded to the culture and sequencing results of the isolates. overall accuracy of the validation assay was  95% as there was difficulty in identifying the streptococci due to heterogeneity  observed in the pcr amplicons of s. uberis. the present study revealed that broad-range real-time pcr with hrma can be used as a powerful, fast and low-cost  tool for the differentiation of clinically important bacterial mastitis pathogens.

TI  == the effect of recurrent episodes of clinical mastitis caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and other organisms on mortality and culling in holstein dairy cows.
AB  == the objective of this study was to estimate the effects of recurrent episodes of  different types of clinical mastitis (cm) caused by gram-positive (streptococcus  spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus spp.) and gram-negative (escherichia  coli, klebsiella, citrobacter, enterobacter, pseudomonas) bacteria, and other organisms (arcanobacterium pyogenes, mycoplasma, corynebacterium bovis, yeast, miscellaneous) on the probability of mortality and culling in holstein dairy cows. data from 30,233 lactations in cows of 7 dairy farms in new york state were analyzed. cows were followed for the first 10 mo in lactation, or until death or  culling occurred, or until the end of our study period. generalized linear mixed  models with a poisson error distribution were used to study the effects of recurrent cases of the different types of cm and several other factors (herd, parity, month of lactation, current year and season, profitability, net replacement cost, other diseases) on cows' probability of death (model 1) or being culled (model 2). primiparous and multiparous cows were modeled separately  because they had different risks of mortality and culling and potentially different cm effects on mortality and culling. approximately 30% of multiparous cows had at least one case of cm in lactation compared with 16.6% of primiparous  cows. multipara also had higher lactational incidence risks of second (10.7%) and third (4.4%) cases than primipara (3.7% and 1.1%, respectively). for primipara, cm increased the probability of death, with each successive case occurring in a month being increasingly lethal. in multipara, gram-negative cm increased the probability of death, especially when the gram-negative case was the first or second cm case in lactation. primiparous cows with cm were more likely to be culled after cm than if they did not have cm, particularly after a second or third case. in multipara, any type of cm increased the probability of being culled. gram-negative cm cases were associated with the numerically highest risk  of culling.

TI  == exploring internal features of 16s rrna gene for identification of clinically relevant species of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == background: streptococcus is an economically important genus as a number of species belonging to this genus are human and animal pathogens. the genus has been divided into different groups based on 16s rrna gene sequence similarity. the variability observed among the members of these groups is low and it is difficult to distinguish them. the present study was taken up to explore 16s rrna gene sequence to develop methods that can be used for preliminary identification  and can supplement the existing methods for identification of clinically-relevant isolates of the genus streptococcus. methods: 16s rrna gene sequences belonging to the isolates of s. dysgalactiae, s. equi, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, s. gallolyticus, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. pneumoniae, s. thermophilus and s. anginosus were analyzed with the purpose to define genetic variability within each species to generate a phylogenetic framework, to identify species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. results: the framework based analysis was used to segregate streptococcus spp. previously  identified upto genus level. this segregation was validated using species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. 43 uncharacterized streptococcus spp. could be identified using this approach. conclusions: the markers generated exploring 16s rrna gene sequences provided useful tool that can be further used for identification of different species of the genus streptococcus.

TI  == diagnosis of intramammary infection in samples yielding negative results or minor pathogens in conventional bacterial culturing.
AB  == up to half of quarter milk samples submitted for mastitis diagnosis are culture-negative results or lead to identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci or corynebacterium bovis in conventional culturing, the so-called minor pathogens. the interpretation and usefulness of these results in terms of udder and animal health management is limited, even though the amount of resources spent is relatively high. this work aimed to test two methods of analysis of milk samples with the goal of increasing detection of intramammary pathogens. in the first study, 783 milk samples were processed in duplicate: before and after freezing at -20 degrees c for 24 h, using standard bacteriological techniques. there was a significant difference between the two methods with samples frozen for 24 h yielding significantly fewer gram-positive catalase-positive cocci, gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive bacilli and significantly more samples leading to no growth, than samples before freezing. the number of samples yielding gram-positive catalase-negative cocci was not significantly affected by freezing. in the second study, a real-time pcr-based test was performed on milk samples with an individual quarter somatic cell count  above 500,000 cells/ml that were either negative (n=51 samples) or that led to the isolation of minor pathogens in culturing: corynebacterium bovis (n=79 samples) or non-aureus staphylococci (nas, n=32). a mastitis pathogen, beyond the result obtained with standard bacteriology, was detected on 47% of the no-growth  samples, on 35% of the samples from which c. bovis had been isolated and on 25% of the samples from which nas had been isolated. the most commonly detected major pathogen was escherichia coli, followed by streptococcus uberis, arcanobacterium  pyogenes/peptoniphilus indolicus and streptococcus dysgalactiae. these results suggest that simply freezing milk samples for 24 h does not increase the detection of intramammary bacteria in milk samples and therefore should not be recommended. however, use of the real-time pcr-based test may be useful in diagnosing intramammary infections when milk samples with high somatic cell counts are culture-negative or when culturing results in the detection of minor pathogens.

TI  == partial recn gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus streptococcus.
AB  == partial sequences of the recn gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. the partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. the mean dna sequence similarity of recn gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be  lower than those of the 16s rrna gene (94.1 %), rpob (84.6 %), soda (74.8 %), groel (78.1 %) and gyrb (73.2 %). phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: streptococcus salivarius, s. equinus, s. hyovaginalis/s. pluranimalium/s. thoraltensis, s. pyogenes, s. mutans and s. suis. the 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: streptococcus sanguinis/s. cristatus/s. sinensis, s. anginosus/s. intermedius/s. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and s. mitis/s. infantis/s. peroris/s. oralis/s. oligofermentans/s. pneumoniae/s. pseudopneumoniae. the partial recn gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. this observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groel, gyrb, rpob and soda). a high percentage of similarity was found between s. intermedius and s. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recn gene. to study the genetic  diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recn, groel, soda, gyrb and rpob sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. the results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.

TI  == pathogen detection in milk samples by ligation detection reaction-mediated universal array method.
AB  == this paper describes a new dna chip, based on the use of a ligation detection reaction coupled to a universal array, developed to detect and analyze, directly  from milk samples, microbial pathogens known to cause bovine, ovine, and caprine  mastitis or to be responsible for foodborne intoxication or infection, or both. probes were designed for the identification of 15 different bacterial groups: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, nonaureus staphylococci, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus equi, streptococcus canis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus parauberis, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus pyogenes, mycoplasma spp., salmonella spp., bacillus spp., campylobacter spp., and escherichia coli and related species. these groups were identified based on the 16s rrna gene. for microarray validation, 22 strains from the american type culture collection or other culture collections and 50 milk samples were tested.  the results demonstrated high specificity, with sensitivity as low as 6 fmol. moreover, the ligation detection reaction-universal array assay allowed for the identification of mycoplasma spp. in a few hours, avoiding the long incubation times of traditional microbiological identification methods. the universal array  described here is a versatile tool able to identify milk pathogens efficiently and rapidly.

TI  == real-time polymerase chain reaction-based identification of bacteria in milk samples from bovine clinical mastitis with no growth in conventional culturing.
AB  == in more than 30% of milk samples from clinical and subclinical bovine mastitis, bacteria fail to grow even after 48 h of conventional culture. the "no-growth" samples are problematic for mastitis laboratories, veterinarians, and dairy producers. this study provides the first investigation of the bacteriological etiology of such samples, using a real-time pcr-based commercial reagent kit. the assay targets the dna of the 11 most common bacterial species or groups in mastitis and the staphylococcal blaz gene (responsible for penicillin resistance) and can identify and quantify bacterial cells even if dead or growth-inhibited. a study was made of 79 mastitic milk samples with no-growth bacteria in conventional culture, originating from cows with clinical mastitis. of the 79 samples, 34 (43%) were positive for 1 (32 samples) or 2 (2 samples) of the target bacteria. the positive findings included 11 staphylococcus spp. (staphylococci other than staphylococcus aureus), 10 streptococcus uberis, 2 streptococcus dysgalactiae, 6 corynebacterium bovis, 3 staph. aureus, 1 escherichia coli, 1 enterococcus, and 1 arcanobacterium pyogenes. the positive samples contained as many as 10(3) to 10(7) bacterial genome copies per milliliter of milk. this study demonstrates that in nearly half of the clinical mastitis cases in which conventional culture failed to detect bacteria, mastitis pathogens were still present, often in substantial quantities. the clearly elevated n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase activity values of the milk samples, together with clinical signs of the infected cows and quarters, confirmed the diagnosis of clinical mastitis and indicated that real-time, pcr-based bacterial findings are  able to reveal bacteriological etiology. we conclude that all common mastitis bacteria can occur in large quantities in clinical mastitis samples that exhibit  no growth in conventional culture, and that the real-time pcr assay is a useful tool for bacteriological diagnosis of such milk samples. low bacterial concentration is commonly speculated to explain the no-growth milk samples. this  hypothesis is not supported by the results of the current study.

TI  == ability of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 to participate in bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelial barrier.
AB  == although hundreds of microbial species reside in the human intestinal tract, comparatively few (e.g., escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, enterococcus  faecalis, etc.) are typically associated with systemic infection in postsurgical, shock, and trauma patients. syndecan-1 is the predominant cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on epithelia, and there is substantial evidence that heparan sulfate participates in interactions of a variety of frankly pathogenic microbes with mammalian cells. to investigate the role of syndecan-1 in interactions of enteric flora with intestinal epithelium, bacteria that might  use the enterocyte as a portal of entry for systemic infection (including e. faecalis, e. coli, and other enterobacteria, and several species of staphylococci and streptococci) were studied for their abilities to interact with syndecan-1. streptococcus bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis showed increased adherence to arh-77 cells transfected to express syndecan-1. heparin, a heparan sulfate analog, inhibited internalization of s. bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, and s. aureus by ht-29 enterocytes (prominent  syndecan-1 expression), but not caco-2 enterocytes (relatively low syndecan-1 expression). data from experiments with chinese hamster ovary cells with altered  glycosaminoglycan expression indicated that heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (glycosaminoglycans on the syndecan-1 ectodomain) participated in bacterial interactions with mammalian cells. thus, although e. faecalis, e. coli, and other gram-negative enterobacteria did not appear to interact with syndecan-1, this heparan sulfate proteoglycan may mediate enterocyte interactions with some staphylococci and streptococci that are known to cause systemic infections in specific populations of high-risk, immunosuppressed, postsurgical,  and trauma patients.

AB  == aim: to describe the gross pathology, bacteriology and histopathology of the reproductive tracts of dairy cows that failed to conceive or maintain pregnancy.  methods: the reproductive tracts of 105 cows that were not pregnant at the end of the seasonal breeding programme were retrieved following slaughter. the tracts were examined grossly, both horns of the uterine lumen were swabbed for bacteriology, and tissue was collected from each horn and the body of the uterus  for histopathology. grossly enlarged uteri and tracts containing purulent vaginal content were excluded. histopathology was performed on three sections of uterine  tissue from each of three cows in which no gross pathological changes were detected and from which no bacteria were isolated, from three cows in which no gross pathology was detected but from which bacteria were isolated, and from three cows in which gross pathological changes were detected but from which no bacteria were isolated. results: thirty-six (34%) cows had one or more gross lesions which involved the ovary, uterine tube, uterus or vagina. bacteria were isolated from the uteri of 22 (21%) cows. isolates included arcanobacterium pyogenes (n = 1), escherichia coli (n = 1), fusobacterium spp (n = 1), haemophilus somnus (n = 5), streptococcus acidominimus (n = 12), s. bovis (n = 2), s. uberis (n = 1) and s. salivarious (n = 1). in only five cows were both gross pathology and bacteria detected. there was no relationship between the isolation of bacteria and the diagnosis of gross pathology of the uterus. there were no differences in the degree of histopathological changes in the uteri from  the three groups of cows examined, and lesions present were minor. conclusions: gross pathological changes and intra-uterine bacteria were found in 34% and 20% of cows, respectively, but the correlation between the two was poor. histopathological changes were unremarkable, suggesting the bacteriological findings were coincidental, that causative agents of infertility were not present at the time of examination, or that unrelated causes such as nutritional anoestrus may have been responsible for the failure of some cows to conceive.

TI  == binding of porcine ficolin-alpha to lipopolysaccharides from gram-negative bacteria and lipoteichoic acids from gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == protein(s) reactive with n-acetyl-d-glucosamine (glcnac) was isolated from porcine nonimmune serum. the molecular weight of the purified protein was found to be mainly 40 kda on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  under reducing conditions. the n-terminal 10 amino acid sequence of the purified  protein were found to be identical to that of porcine ficolin-alpha reported previously. in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the purified protein was found  to react with lipopolysaccharides (lps) from different gram-negative bacteria such as esherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, salmonella abortus equi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, shigella flexeneri, and serratia marcescens and with lipoteichoic acid (lta) from gram-positive bacteria such as streptococcus sanguis, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus. the purified protein also reacted with e. coli o26 isolated from food poisoning and bovine feces and heat-treated gram-positive bacteria such as s. aureus, b. cereus, b. subtilis, enterococcus faecium, and corynebacterum bovis. on the other hand, porcine igg isolated from nonimmune serum showed different reactivity with these lps, lta, and heat-treated bacterial cells. from the present findings, purified porcine serum protein reactive with glcnac is concluded to be ficolin-alpha playing an important role(s) in innate immunity against microbial infection with gram-positive and -negative bacteria.

AB  == a study of 340 necropsied dairy cattle from northern bavaria resulted in 31 animals (9%) showing evidence of pyemic thromboembolism. the most frequent pathomorphologic lesions consisted in endocarditis valvularis thromboticans of the tricuspid and/or mitral valve (21), embolic pneumonia (26), nephritis (13) and renal infarction (12). the most common isolate found in bacteriologic culture was arcanobacterium pyogenes in 26 of 31 cases, followed by staphylococcus aureus (2), mannheimia haemolytica (2) and streptococcus bovis (1) in rare cases. in 27  of 31 cows a possible cause of pyemic thromboembolism was found; in 23 cases claw diseases and decubital ulcera were probably responsible.

TI  == the value of comparison.
AB  == with the number of published microbial genomes now in excess of 100, any new genome that is sequenced is likely to have a close relative available for comparison. indeed, it is increasingly difficult to perform any genomic analysis  that is not comparative. this should, however, not be seen as a drawback; it is often the case that a large amount of information can be drawn from these comparisons, especially between closely related organisms. several genome sequences published recently indicate the value of comparisons at the genomic level.

TI  == rpob gene sequence-based identification of aerobic gram-positive cocci of the genera streptococcus, enterococcus, gemella, abiotrophia, and granulicatella.
AB  == we developed a new molecular tool based on rpob gene (encoding the beta subunit of rna polymerase) sequencing to identify streptococci. we first sequenced the complete rpob gene for streptococcus anginosus, s. equinus, and abiotrophia defectiva. sequences were aligned with these of s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. pneumoniae available in genbank. using an in-house analysis program (svarap),  we identified a 740-bp variable region surrounded by conserved, 20-bp zones and,  by using these conserved zones as pcr primer targets, we amplified and sequenced  this variable region in an additional 30 streptococcus, enterococcus, gemella, granulicatella, and abiotrophia species. this region exhibited 71.2 to 99.3% interspecies homology. we therefore applied our identification system by pcr amplification and sequencing to a collection of 102 streptococci and 60 bacterial isolates belonging to other genera. amplicons were obtained in streptococci and bacillus cereus, and sequencing allowed us to make a correct identification of streptococci. molecular signatures were determined for the discrimination of closely related species within the s. pneumoniae-s. oralis-s. mitis group and the s. agalactiae-s. difficile group. these signatures allowed us to design a s. pneumoniae-specific pcr and sequencing primer pair.

TI  == bovicin hc5, a bacteriocin from streptococcus bovis hc5.
AB  == previous work indicated that streptococcus bovis hc5 had significant antibacterial activity, and even nisin-resistant s. bovis jb1 cells could be strongly inhibited. s. bovis hc5 inhibited a variety of gram-positive bacteria and the spectrum of activity was similar to monensin, a commonly used feed additive. the crude extracts (ammonium sulfate precipitation) were inactivated by pronase e and trypsin, but the activity was resistant to heat, proteinase k and alpha-chymotrypsin. most of the antibacterial activity was cell associated, but it could be liberated by acidic nacl (100 mm, ph 2.0) without significant cell lysis. when glycolysing s. bovis jb1 cells were treated with either crude or acidic nacl extracts, intracellular potassium declined and this result indicated  the antibacterial activity was mediated by a pore-forming peptide. the peptide could be purified by hplc and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis indicated that it had a molecular mass of approximately 2440 da. the terminal amino acid sequence was vgxryasxpgxswkyvxf. the unnamed amino acid residues (designated by x) had approximately the same position as dehydroalanines found in some lantibiotics, but samples that were reduced and alkylated prior to edman degradation did not have cysteine residues. the only other bacteriocin that had significant similarity was the lantibiotic precursor of streptococcus pyogenes sf370, but the identity was only 55%. based on these results, the bacteriocin of s. bovis hc5 appears to be novel and the authors now  designate it as bovicin hc5.

TI  == emerging and reemerging pathogens.
AB  == from 1973 to 1995, 29 new and reemerging pathogenic microbes were recognized. however, in discussions about emerging infectious diseases, the focus is often on the clinical effects of the host-parasite relationship, rather than the examination of the biology of the pathogen. many of what we refer to as emerging  diseases are characterized better as 'diseases of human progress'. thus, the aerosolization of water has played an important role in the emergence of legionella pneumophila infections. new diseases are superimposed on endemic diseases such as diarrhoeal diseases, malaria and tuberculosis. in addition, many pathogens are becoming increasingly resistant to standard antimicrobial drugs, making treatment difficult and in some cases impossible. we summarize our experience on emerging parasitic diseases (primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, respiratory cryptosporidiosis, and diplogonoporiasis), and selected problems of bacterial resistance (mdr tuberculosis caused by mycobacterium bovis and macrolide-resistance mechanisms of streptococcus pneumoniae and s. pyogenes).

TI  == streptococcal meningitis in adult patients: current epidemiology and clinical spectrum.
AB  == streptococci other than streptococcus pneumoniae are a rare cause of bacterial meningitis in adults. we report 29 cases of streptococcal meningitis (1977-1997). the patients comprised 19 men and 10 women, with a mean age +/- standard deviation of 47 +/- 18 years. nine cases were secondary to neurosurgical procedures, seven to brain abscess, five to cerebrospinal fluid pericranial fistula, and three to endocarditis. causative microorganisms included the following: viridans group streptococci, 20 cases; anaerobic streptococci, 3; streptococcus agalactiae, 3; streptococcus bovis, 2; and streptococcus pyogenes,  1. four streptococcus mitis strains showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin (mic, 0.5-2 microg/ml). five patients (17%) died. the infection is increasing in  the hospital setting. streptococci resistant to penicillin should be considered in the empirical treatment of nosocomial meningitis. in cases of community-acquired infection, anaerobic streptococci or streptococci of the streptococcus milleri group should alert the clinician to the presence of an undiagnosed brain abscess, whereas oral streptococci of the viridans group suggest the diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis.

TI  == polymerase chain reaction of bacterial genomes with single universal primer: application to distinguishing mycobacteria species.
AB  == the polymerase chain reaction with a single universal primer (up-pcr) was applied to bacterial strains and mycobacteria isolates alongside conventional methods. a  universal protocol of preparation of pcr samples from cultures representing escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, mycobacterium tuberculosis, mycobacterium bovis, and several non-tuberculous mycobacteria was found to be reproducible and efficient with these organisms. the bands of up-pcr  products observed in an agarose gel after electrophoresis were species-specific and provided an efficient means of distinguishing bacterial species. the applicability of this approach to mycobacteria identification was assessed by comparing the dna bands obtained for different strains. three reference strains and 22 clinical isolates of m. tuberculosis and m. bovis produced very similar dna banding patterns. they comprised a triplet of prominent and several minor fragments within the 200-500 base pair (bp) size range and were the easiest to interpret. the dna profiles of unrelated mycobacteria clearly differed from each  other when subjected to electrophoretic analysis and correlated well with results of culture method. the method provides a real promise of its application in clinical studies as a simple assay for distinguishing between tubercle bacilli.

TI  == inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-p), has been documented for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus bovis, and lactococcus lactis, but not for other gram-positive bacteria. using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated atp-dependent hpr(ser) kinase that phosphorylates ser-46 in hpr of the phosphotransferase system. a small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-p phosphatase (pase  ii), previously identified only in lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, or bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. further, lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks pase ii. the results reveal that pase ii is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-p hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. they provide correlative evidence that pase ii initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.

AB  == the data obtained for the first time in our studies indicate that the production  of antibodies to group a streptococcal polysaccharide (a-ps), one of the cross-reacting streptococcal antigens, may suppress delayed hypersensitivity (dh) to microbial antigens. the existence of sharply pronounced correlation between the suppression of dh and the presence of antibodies to the rhamnose area of a-ps in the blood of balb/c mice immunized with the pepsin-treated culture of group a  streptococci has been shown. the suppression of dh is absent in the immunized animals of the same group whose blood contains antibodies to the determinant, specific for a-ps. as revealed in this study, the effect of the suppression of antigen-specific cytotoxicity linked with dh to bcg antigens can be reproduced by mixing lymph node cells taken from these two groups of the animals. the data thus obtained are possibly linked with the activation of nonspecific t suppressors in  the production of antibodies to the rhamnose determinants of a-ps in the animals  immunized with streptococci. the mechanism of the newly discovered phenomenon is  discussed.

AB  == five hundred and seventy-nine milk samples were collected from dairy cows on seven farms in khartoum north area and one farm in omdurman and examined by bacteriological cultures for the presence of streptococci. one hundred and ninety-three (33.33%) isolates were recovered and identified on the basis of bacteriological characteristics and biochemical reactions as: s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae, s. faecalis, s. faecium, s. bovis, s. equi, s. lactis and s. uberis. fifty-seven isolates representing the preliminary identification were tested by the latex-agglutination test to determine the serological groups. it was found that 39 strains belonged to group b, 3 strains to group c. four strains gave a weak reaction with group d sera and were identified by biochemical tests as s. uberis. two isolates could not be identified by the available sera. the isolation of s. uberis, s. bovis, s. equi,  s. lactis, s. faecalis, s. faecium and s. pyogenes from cows in the sudan was reported for the first time.

TI  == [milk chloride level as an indicator of bovine mastitis].
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine an influence of udder infection on milk chloride level and on milk productivity of cows of black and white race. bacteriological analysis was performed by bacterial isolation from milk collected in sterile conditions from single lobes of mammary gland. the study was aimed to  detect the following bacteria: streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, actinomyces pyogenes, enterobacteriaceae rods, corynebacterium bovis, and micrococcus sp. milk chloride level was determined by burette method in 1250 milk samples collected from entire udder. milk productivity was determined on the day  of bacterial isolation. statistical analysis of the results of the study on udder infection, milk chloride level, and milk productivity of mammary gland did reveal lack of a simple correlations between those parameters and in the indirect manner indicated an influence of inappropriate maintenance conditions of tested cows on  the health condition of their udder. it seems possible that alkalosis and acidosis in cows, taken into consideration in discussion section, could constitute a factor influencing the frequency of mastitis incidence.

TI  == properties of a phosphocarrier protein (hpr) extracted from intact cells of streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == cells of streptococcus sanguis strain challis were incubated with sodium lauroylsarcosinate to extract surface proteins. a polypeptide of apparent molecular mass 16 kda comprising about 12% of the extract was purified using anion-exchange chromatography. the polypeptide was shown to be a phosphocarrier protein (hpr) that could also be found in the soluble (cytoplasmic) fraction from cells broken by homogenization with glass beads. in vivo labelling of s. sanguis  cells with 32pi showed that the polypeptide carried a heat- and acid-stable phosphorylation and that during sucrose starvation the hpr became dephosphorylated. antiserum raised to the s. sanguis hpr reacted on western blots with hprs from all oral streptococci tested, together with strains of s. pyogenes and s. salivarius, but not with hprs from s. faecalis or s. bovis, nor with proteins from staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, actinomyces viscosus and  various lactobacilli. the s. sanguis hpr had a high content of alanine (17.2%) and was similar in overall amino acid composition to the hprs from s. mutans an s. salivarius. the n-terminal residues (to 37) of the s. sanguis hpr showed strong sequence identity (82%) with the n-terminal sequence of s. faecalis hpr. it is suggested that hpr in s. sanguis is associated closely with the cytoplasmic membrane. non-disruptive methods of removing cell-surface proteins from streptococci effect release of hpr and possibly other cytoplasmic components.

TI  == dna probe for identification of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == a total of 287 clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) were  tested for their ability to undergo autolysis when treated with sodium deoxycholate. the test was positive for all but one isolate, strain doc-1. this autolysis required the activity of an enzyme which is unique and characteristic of s. pneumoniae: a choline-dependent n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, the gene product of the lyta gene. we used lyta as a dna probe to test the distribution of the autolysin gene among clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae. in dot blot hybridization experiments our probe reacted with the dna of 60 of 60 strains tested, including the autolysis-deficient clinical isolate doc-1. no hybridization occurred when strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus bovis were tested. the lyta gene appears to be an ideal candidate for use as a dna probe for the identification of s. pneumoniae.

AB  == ly163892 is a new orally absorbed carbacephem. it inhibited streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae at less than or equal to 1 mg/l, but was less active against group b streptococci and groups c, f, g and bovis streptococci with mics  of 1 to 2 mg/l for most but as high as 8 mg/l for some isolates. mic90 of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus was 8 mg/l, but greater than 128 mg/l for methicillin-resistant staphylococci. ly163892 had activity similar to cefaclor and cephalexin with mic90 values of 16 mg/l for escherichia coli, 8 mg/l for klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, yersinia enterocolitica, but was more active against haemophilus influenzae, and branhamella catarrhalis. it had no activity against enterobacter, providencia, serratia, and pseudomonas and bacteroides spp. ly163892 was more rapidly lytic than cephalexin. it was hydrolyzed by a number of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. for tem-1, the km = 354.7 microm, vmax = 2.5 micromoles/min/mg of protein, p99 km = 24.3 microm, vmax = 28.9 microm/min/micrograms of protein, staph. aureus pc km = 47.4 microm,  vmax = 2.7 micromoles/min/mg of protein. overall it had beta-lactamase stability  similar to cefaclor, less than cephalexin, and markedly less than cefuroxime.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of bmy-28100 was tested against approximately 7,000 bacterial pathogens in a multicenter, multiphased collaborative investigation. the bmy-28100 spectrum and antimicrobial potency was most similar to that of cefaclor and superior to that of cephalexin among currently available cephalosporins. species that had greater than or equal to 90% of clinical strains inhibited by bmy-28100 (less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml) were: citrobacter diversus, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp., branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus supp., streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, serogroup c and g streptococci, listeria monocytogenes and gm-positive anaerobes. bmy-28100 inhibited 9% more of the 6286 fresh clinical isolates at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml than cefaclor at the same concentration. bmy-28100 was generally bactericidal, but mics for some species were markedly increased when an inoculum concentration of 10(7) cfu/ml was used. strains producing plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (tem, oxa, shv, hms) were susceptible to bmy-28100, cefaclor, and cefuroxime. bmy-28100 was less active against strains producing chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases (types i and iv). bmy-28100 was not hydrolyzed significantly by the tested plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but  was destroyed by type i cephalosporinases and klebsiella k1 enzymes.

AB  == the bactericidal activity of teicoplanin was studied in a model system in which antibiotic concentration is continuously varied. a two-compartment open model was used to reproduce, in vitro serum pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin in humans during 24 h after iv administration. staphylococcal and streptococcal strains of  various species were tested. teicoplanin showed rapid killing of staphylococcus epidermidis and staph. hominis. all strains of staph. epidermidis were rapidly killed in spite of the high mic values (4-16 mg/l). the killing effect against staph. haemolyticus was less rapid and marked than against staph. epidermidis, with strain to strain variation. a 99.9% kill was achieved for most strains within 22 h, but with other isolates regrowth occurred which was due to the presence of highly resistant cells in the original population. other staphylococci (staph. aureus, staph. saprophyticus) and streptococcus pyogenes, str. bovis and str. salivarius were reduced by 99.9% within 22 h. bactericidal activity against other streptococci (str. mutans, str. agalactiae, str. faecalis, str. faecium) was less marked; against str. sanguis teicoplanin was bacteriostatic.

TI  == molecular genetics of resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin b  (mls) in streptococci.
AB  == resistance to macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin b (mls phenotype) appears in  almost all streptococcal species isolated from man. genes coding for mls resistance are located on plasmids and one mls resistance transposon has been described. mls resistance genes have also been found in a large number of plasmid-free strains. plasmids of 17 to 20 megadaltons (mdal) that code either for mls or for both mls and chloramphenicol resistance are found in streptococci  of groups a, b, c, d (streptococcus faecalis) and g. these plasmids have broad host ranges (conjugative intraspecies, interspecies and intergeneric transfer), display similar restriction enzyme patterns and share a considerable degree of homology (78 to 95%). one smaller non-conjugative mls resistance plasmid has been isolated from str. sanguis (4.5 mdal). in group d (str. faecalis, str. faecium) streptococci, mls resistance genes are also found on plasmids that carry other antibiotic resistance (tetracycline, chloramphenicol, high-levels of streptomycin and kanamycin). these multi-resistance plasmids are either conjugative or non-conjugative and are of various sizes and molecular species and those that have been tested have narrow host-ranges. the mls resistance genes of one multi-resistant plasmid, isolated from a strain of str. faecalis, are located on  a transposon of 3.3 mdal, tn917. hybridization studies, with mls determinants as  probes, reveal homologies among various plasmid-borne mls resistance sequences. elements that are thought to be chromosome-borne mediate multiple antibiotic resistance (including mls) in streptococci of groups a, b, c, d (str. bovis), f,  g, str. pneumoniae, str. mitis, str. sanguis and str. milleri. strains harbouring such elements contain no detectable plasmid dna. in some of the strains these elements are conjugative; their resistance markers transfer en bloc at low frequency and display narrow host ranges. such elements, from str. pyogenes and str. agalactiae, were found to translocate onto various streptococcal haemolysin-bacteriocin plasmids.

TI  == mode of action and in-vitro activity of vancomycin.
AB  == vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. it also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. there is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits  ribonucleic acid synthesis. induction of bacterial l-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. stable l-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to  vancomycin. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant  strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), str. pyogenes, str. agalactiae, str. bovis, str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species and lactobacillus species. there has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against staph. aureus, str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. the combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of staph. epidermidis. it shows indifference against enterococci. vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against staph. aureus.

TI  == detection and partial characterization of antibacterial factor(s) in alveolar lining material of rats.
AB  == intracellular killing of staphylococcus aureus by alveolar macrophages is known to be enhanced by exposure to alveolar lining material. because this material may have a role in pulmonary host defenses, we have studied its effect on pneumococci and other nonstaphylococcal organisms. alveolar lining material from rats caused  rapid killing and lysis of pneumococci. the antipneumococcal activity was localized to the surfactant-containing fraction of the fluid and was not affected by trypsin. phospholipid extracts of the surfactant fraction or purified lamellar bodies killed pneumococci. lysis of pneumococci by the surfactant fraction appeared to be mediated by a detergent-like activation of pneumococcal autolysin, in that bacteriolysis was prevented by substitution of ethanolamine for choline in pneumococcal cell walls, and a pneumococcal transformant that lacked autolysin was not lysed. the surfactant fraction readily killed pneumococci containing ethanolamine or the autolysin-defective transformant, and studies with tritiated  methyl-d-glucose loading and release showed that killing was associated with increased bacterial cell membrane permeability. bactericidal activity (without lysis) was observed with several nonpneumococcal gram-positive bacteria, including streptococcus viridans, unspeciated respiratory streptococci, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus bovis, and bacillus species. purified diacylphospholipids had no antibacterial activity, however, a lysophospholipid, palmitoyl lysophosphatidylcholine, had many properties resembling the surfactant-containing fraction of lavage, including autolysin-mediated pneumococcal lysis, altered cell membrane permeability, and antibacterial activity against several gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == the ecology of the streptococci.
AB  == all species of streptococci are divided into several groups according to the ecological niches they occupy. members of the lactic acid group are found only in the plant environment and the dairy. members of the pyogenic group and the buccal and intestinal residents of the subthermophilic group are found in intimate association only with homeothermic hosts. members of the virulent pyogenic group, such asstreptococcus pyogenes, s. equi, ands. infrequens, are restricted to single hosts-the human, the horse, and the pig-whereas others, such ass. agalactiae can be found in several hosts. the intestinal dwellers of the subthermophilic group,s. bovis ands. equinus, occur in several animal species and are not isolated from other sources. the superficially homogeneouss. faecalis of  the "enteric" group may actually consist of a group specifically restricted to the human host, and of a second group distributed among wild animals, insects, and plants. the latter group differs from the human type by the ability to hydrolyze starch and to produce a rennin-proteolytic type of curd in milk.streptococcus faecium is widely distributed in both the homeothermic and poikilothermic environments, but no properties which differentiate the sources are known.streptococcus faecium biot.casseliflavus has been isolated only from insects and plants.streptococcus uberis occurs on the bovine lips and skin. unidentified streptococci from all environments vary widely in properties. many resembles. lactis, s. faecalis, ands. faecium.

TI  == mannitol agar for microbiologic diagnosis of bovine mastitis.
AB  == a medium containing mannitol (mannitol agar) was developed and evaluated as a tool for the microbiologic diagnosis of bovine mastitis. mannitol agar supported  growth of all important bacterial mastitis pathogens (staphylococci, streptococci, coliforms, and pseudomonads) except corynebacterium pyogenes. color change around colonies in the agar permitted the differentiation of pathogenic from nonpathogenic staphylococci. most staphylococcus aureus strains and some staphylococcus epidermidis strains produced yellow zones. these yellow zone-producing strains (mannitol fermenters) of staphylococci were obtained from  quarters with significantly elevated (p less than 0.05) somatic cell counts (scc) in the milk, as compared with uninfected quarters and, therefore, would be considered pathogens. mannitol-negative strains of s epidermidis (those with red  zones) were obtained from quarters with scc similar to those of uninfected quarters. the streptococci could be divided into 2 groups on the basis of color change around the colonies: streptococcus agalactiae, str dysgalactiae, and group g streptococci produced red zones; str uberis, str bovis, and enterococci produced yellow zones. pathogenic streptococci (str agalactiae, str dysgalactiae, str uberis, and group g streptococci) were obtained from quarters with scc significantly higher (p less than 0.01) than those of uninfected quarters. streptococcus bovis and enterococci were obtained from quarters with scc similar  to those of uninfected quarters and were considered nonpathogenic. pathogenic streptococci were found in much higher concentration than nonpathogenic streptococci and could be differentiated on that basis.

AB  == sera from rabbits immunized with sonicates of mycobacterium bovis bcg were passed through an immunoadsorbent made of a soluble bcg extract to make partially purified antibodies to bcg. these antibodies were in turn used to prepare an immunoadsorbent through which the bcg extract was passed. the partially purified  antigenic material was radiolabeled and subjected to electrophoresis in acrylamide gels. one of the radiolabeled fractions isolated (bcg-c) was found to  bind to antibodies to bcg and h37rv, but not to antibodies in sera from rabbits immunized with other mycobacterial species or nocardia asteroides. the reaction between bcg-c and the partially purified antibodies to bcg was inhibited by small amounts of different bcg antigens. cultures obtained from 25 patients with tuberculous diseases, other bacterial cultures, and various bacterial extracts were tested for their capacity to inhibit this reaction. each of 13 mycobacteria  identified as m. tuberculosis inhibited this reaction. equivalent numbers of 12 strains of mycobacteria other than m. tuberculosis and high concentrations of other bacterial extracts did not inhibit, indicating that determinants of bcg present in m. tuberculosis were not detected in the other mycobacteria or in non-acid-fast bacteria. the use of sequential purification procedures could be of potential clinical value in quickly differentiating between m. tuberculosis and a variety of other mycobacteria.

TI  == streptococci and aerococci associated with systemic infection in man.
AB  == a collection of 820 isolates of streptococci and aerococci from human blood or internal organs was classified by means of a set of cultural and biochemical tests. of these, 719 (712 streptococci and 7 aerococci) were from patients believed to be suffering from a systemic infection: endocarditis 317; a purulent  lesion in an internal organ ("purulent disease") 152; bacteriaemia 250. the endocarditis streptococci included members of all recognisable taxa, but only certain of these were common: streptococcus sanguis, 16-4%; dextran-positive and  usually mannitol-fermenting strains of s. bovis (s. bovis i), 15-1%; s. mutans, 14-2%; s. mitior, 13-2%. streptococci of the "alpha-haemolytic" taxa (s. sanguis, s. mitior and related strains) formed only 44-8% of the total. when the percentage frequency of streptococcal taxa among the endocarditis and "non-endocarditis" isolates was compared, the dextran-forming taxa (s. mutans, s. bovis i, s. sanguis, and dextran-positive streptococci otherwise resembling s. mitior) all had higher "endocarditis : non-endocarditis" ratios than did any of the non-dextran-producing taxa. endocarditis increased in frequency with age, and showed an excess of males over females up to the age of 65 years. in young patients (less than 35 years), "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci predominated; with increasing age, the proportion of other streptococci increased progressively but  the absolute numbers of isolations of "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci did not fall. infections with s. mutans were prominent in the age-group 35-54 years and with s. bovis i at ages greater than or equal to 55 years. a history of previous  heart disease was more often obtained in endocarditis due to "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci than in other streptococcal endocarditis. the streptococcus most often isolated from purulent lesions in internal organs was s. milleri (29-3%). it was associated with brain abscess, meningitis, pleural empyema and a variety of intra-abdominal abscesses. the only common predisposing factor in endocarditis was previous heart damage. in other systemic streptococcal diseases, other general or local predisposing causes could be observed, mainly in infections with the "pyogenic" groupable streptococci, the enterococci and s. milleri.
