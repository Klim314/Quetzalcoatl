TI  == microbiological characterization in children with aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == the objective of this study was to characterize the subgingival microbiota of african-american children with localized aggressive periodontitis (lap). fifty-one children were included. subgingival plaque samples were taken from diseased (dd) and healthy sites (dh) in lap and from healthy sites in hs and hc and analyzed by 16s rrna-based microarrays. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) was the only species found to be both more prevalent (or = 8.3, p = 0.0025)  and abundant (p < 0.01) in dd. filifactor alocis (fa) was also found to be more prevalent in dd (or 2.31, ci 1.06-5.01, p = 0.03). most prevalent species in healthy sites were selenomonas spp, veillonella spp, streptococcus spp, bergeyella sp, and kingella oralis. overall, streptococcus spp, campylobacter gracilis, capnocytophaga granulosa, haemophilus parainfluenzae, and lautropia mirabilis were most abundant in healthy children, while aa, fa, tannerella sp, solobacterium moorei, parvimonas micra, and capnocytophaga sp were most abundant  in lap. based on a comprehensive analysis with 16s rrna-based microarrays, aa was strongly associated and site-specific in lap. in contrast, other species were found to be associated with healthy sites and individuals (clinicaltrials.gov number ct01330719). abbreviations: healthy site in healthy sibling (hs); healthy  site in healthy control child (hc).

TI  == microbiological diversity of generalized aggressive periodontitis by 16s rrna clonal analysis.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of this study was to determine the bacterial diversity in the subgingival plaque of subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis by using culture-independent molecular methods based on 16s ribosomal dna cloning. methods: samples from 10 subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis were selected. dna was extracted and the 16s rrna gene was amplified with the universal primer pairs 9f and 1525r. amplified genes were  cloned, sequenced, and identified by comparison with known 16s rrna sequences. results: one hundred and ten species were identified from 10 subjects and 1007 clones were sequenced. of these, 70 species were most prevalent. fifty-seven percent of the clone (40 taxa) sequences represented phylotypes for which no cultivated isolates have been reported. several species of selenomonas and streptococcus were found at high prevalence and proportion in all subjects. overall, 50% of the clone libraries were formed by these two genera. selenomonas  sputigena, the species most commonly detected, was found in nine of 10 subjects.  other species of selenomonas were often present at high levels, including s. noxia, selenomonas sp. ew084, selenomonas sp. ew076, selenomonas ft050, selenomonas sp. p2pa_80, and selenomonas sp. strain gaa14. the classical putative periodontal pathogens, such as, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, was below  the limit of detection and was not detected. conclusion: these data suggest that  other species, notably species of selenomonas, may be associated with disease in  generalized aggressive periodontitis subjects.
