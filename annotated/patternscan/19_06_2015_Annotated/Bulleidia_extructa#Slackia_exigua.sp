TI  == gram-positive anaerobic bacilli in human periodontal disease.
AB  == objective: the uncertain taxonomy of oral anaerobic gram-positive bacilli and their generally slow growing nature has limited the understanding of their role in periodontal disease. the current objective was to design and use species-specific oligonucleotide probes to investigate the relationship of selected gram-positive anaerobic bacilli to periodontal disease. methods: plaque  and clinical measurements were collected from 40 patients with periodontitis and  from 40 matched controls. oligonucleotide probes were designed for bulleidia extructa, eubacterium nodatum, mogibacterium timidum and slackia exigua and used  to probe nucleic acids extracted from the samples with a chemiluminescent detection method. species were quantified as absent or present at low (approximately 10(3)-10(4) cells), medium (approximately 10(4)-10(5) cells) or high levels (approximately 10(5)-10(6) cells). results: m. timidum and b. extructa were detected in only three and four samples, respectively. the level of both e. nodatum and s. exigua was significantly higher in deep than shallow pockets (wilcoxon, p < 0.001). the level of e. nodatum, but not s. exigua, was higher in patients than matched controls (mann-whitney u, p < 0.03). using an ordered logistic regression model, the probing depth of the sampled sites had the greatest influence on the level of both species and significant variations occurred between individuals. bleeding also influenced the levels of both species, with supragingival plaque influencing s. exigua. conclusion: both e. nodatum and s. exigua were associated with clinical indicators of periodontal disease.

TI  == characterisation of eubacterium-like strains isolated from oral infections.
AB  == the genus eubacterium currently includes a heterogeneous group of gram-positive,  non-spore-forming anaerobic bacilli, many of which are slow growing, fastidious and generally unreactive in biochemical tests. as a consequence, cultivation and  identification of isolates are difficult and the taxonomy of the group remains indifferent. in this study, 105 isolates from odontogenic infections, infections  associated with dental implants or saliva from healthy subjects and provisionally assigned to the genus eubacterium were subjected to phenotypic and genotypic analysis. ninety-one of the isolates were identified as belonging to one of 14 previously described species: atopobium parvulum (5 isolates), a. rimae (29), bulleidia extructa (2), cryptobacterium curtum (1), dialister pneumosintes (1), eubacterium saburreum (2), e. sulci (8), e. yurii subsp. yurii (1), filifactor alocis (3), lactobacillus uli (1), mogibacterium timidum (13), m. vescum (6), pseudoramibacter alactolyticus (6) and slackia exigua (13). the remaining 14 isolates did not correspond to existing species. this study confirms the diversity of organisms provisionally assigned to the genus eubacterium by conventional identification methods. this group of organisms is frequently isolated from oral infections but their role in the aetiology of these conditions has yet to be determined.
