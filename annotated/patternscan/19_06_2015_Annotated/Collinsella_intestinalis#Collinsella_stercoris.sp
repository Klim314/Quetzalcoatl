TI  == dynamics and diversity of the 'atopobium cluster' in the human faecal microbiota, and phenotypic characterization of 'atopobium cluster' isolates.
AB  == this study monitored the dynamics and diversity of the human faecal 'atopobium cluster' over a 3-month period using a polyphasic approach. fresh faecal samples  were collected fortnightly from 13 healthy donors (six males and seven females) aged between 26 and 61 years. fish was used to enumerate total (eub338mix) and 'atopobium cluster' (ato291) bacteria, with counts ranging between 1.12x10(11) and 9.95x10(11), and 1.03x10(9) and 1.16x10(11) cells (g dry weight faeces)(-1),  respectively. the 'atopobium cluster' population represented 0.2-22 % of the total bacteria, with proportions donor-dependent. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) using 'atopobium cluster'-specific primers demonstrated faecal populations of these bacteria were relatively stable, with bands identified as collinsella aerofaciens, collinsella intestinalis/collinsella stercoris, collinsella tanakaei, coriobacteriaceae sp. peav3-3, eggerthella lenta, gordonibacter pamelaeae, olsenella profusa, olsenella uli and paraeggerthella hongkongensis in the dgge profiles of individuals. colony pcr was used to identify 'atopobium cluster' bacteria isolated from faeces (n = 224 isolates). 16s rrna gene sequence analysis of isolates demonstrated collinsella aerofaciens represented the predominant (88 % of isolates) member of the 'atopobium cluster' found in human faeces, being found in nine individuals. eggerthella lenta was identified in three individuals (3.6 % of isolates). isolates of collinsella tanakaei, an 'enorma' sp. and representatives of novel species belonging to the 'atopobium cluster' were also identified in the study. phenotypic characterization of the isolates demonstrated their highly saccharolytic nature and heterogeneous phenotypic profiles, and 97 % of the isolates displayed lipase activity.

TI  == emendation of genus collinsella and proposal of collinsella stercoris sp. nov. and collinsella intestinalis sp. nov.
AB  == collinsella aerofaciens-like strains isolated from human faeces were characterized by biochemical tests, cell wall murein analysis and 16s rdna analysis. the results indicated that these strains are phylogenetically a member  of the family coriobacteriaceae and close to the genus collinsella. their phenotypic characters resembled those of collinsella aerofaciens. determination of dna-dna relatedness showed that these strains could be divided into two groups (groups 1 and 2). collinsella aerofaciens and both new groups have a4-type cell wall murein. based on their phenotypic and phylogenetic characters, two new species of the genus collinsella are proposed for the isolated strains: collinsella stercoris for group 1 and collinsella intestinalis for group 2. species-specific pcr primer sets for these two species were also constructed. using these primer sets, collinsella stercoris and collinsella intestinalis can be identified easily and rapidly.
