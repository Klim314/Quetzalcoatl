TI  == biodiversity and gamma-aminobutyric acid production by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional alpine raw cow's milk cheeses.
AB  == "nostrano-cheeses" are traditional alpine cheeses made from raw cow's milk in trentino-alto adige, italy. this study identified lactic acid bacteria (lab) developing during maturation of "nostrano-cheeses" and evaluated their potential  to produce gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba), an immunologically active compound and neurotransmitter. cheese samples were collected on six cheese-making days, in three dairy factories located in different areas of trentino and at different stages of cheese ripening (24 h, 15 days, and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 months). a total  of 1,059 lab isolates were screened using random amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and differentiated into 583 clusters. lab strains from dominant clusters (n = 97) were genetically identified to species level by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. lab species most frequently isolated were lactobacillus paracasei, streptococcus thermophilus, and leuconostoc mesenteroides. the 97 dominant clusters were also characterized for their ability in producing gaba by  high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). about 71% of the dominant bacteria clusters evolving during cheeses ripening were able to produce gaba. most gaba producers were lactobacillus paracasei but other gaba producing species included  lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, pediococcus pentosaceus, and streptococcus thermophilus. no enterococcus faecalis or sc. macedonicus isolates produced gaba. the isolate producing the highest amount of gaba (80.0+/-2.7 mg/kg) was a sc. thermophilus.

TI  == comparison of culture-dependent and -independent methods for bacterial community  monitoring during montasio cheese manufacturing.
AB  == the microbial community in milk is of great importance in the manufacture of traditional cheeses produced using raw milk and natural cultures. during milk curdling and cheese ripening, complex interactions occur in the microbial community, and accurate identification of the microorganisms involved provides essential information for understanding their role in these processes and in flavor production. recent improvements in molecular biological methods have led to their application to food matrices, and thereby opened new perspectives for the study of microbial communities in fermented foods. in this study, a description of microbial community composition during the manufacture and ripening of montasio cheese was provided. a combined approach using culture-dependent and -independent methods was applied. culture-dependent identification was compared with 16s clone libraries sequencing data obtained from both dna and reverse-transcribed rna (cdna) amplification and real-time quantitative pcr (qpcr) assays developed to detect and quantify specific bacterial species/genera (streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei, pediococcus pentosaceus, enterococcus spp., pseudomonas spp.). s. thermophilus was the predominant lab species throughout the entire ripening period of montasio cheese. the culture-independent method demonstrates the relevant presence of pseudomonas spp. and lactococcus piscium at the beginning of ripening. the culture-dependent approach and the two culture-independent approaches produced complementary information, together generating a general view of cheese microbial ecology.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from tarhana, a traditional turkish fermented food.
AB  == tarhana is a traditional fermented product produced from a mixture of spontaneously fermented yogurt and wheat flour in turkey. the aims of the present study were to enumerate and identify for the first time by molecular biology-based methods predominant lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated during processing of tarhana. samples were collected from eight different regions of turkey. in order to explore the relationship between raw material and the microbiology of tarhana, yogurt and wheat flour were also analyzed. a total of 226 gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates were obtained from mrs, m17 and  sbm (slanetz and bartley medium). the isolates were grouped and identified using  a combination of pheno- and genotypic methods including rep-pcr fingerprinting [(gtg)(5) primer], multiplex pcr, 16s rrna gene sequencing and carbohydrate assimilation profiling. pediococcus acidilactici were found to constitute 27% of  the isolates, 19% were identified as streptococcus thermophilus, 19% as lactobacillus fermentum, 12% as enterococcus faecium, 7% as pediococcus pentosaceus, 5% as leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, 4% as weissella cibaria, 2% as lactobacillus plantarum, 2% as lactobacillus delbrueckii spp. bulgaricus, 2% as leuconostoc citreum, 1% as lactobacillus paraplantarum and 0.5% as lactobacillus casei. the different production sites investigated all had individual lab profiles, but with p. acidilactici and s. thermophilus being isolated from the majority of samples. the main source of p. acidilactici and s.  thermophilus was found to be the yogurt.

TI  == redox potential to discriminate among species of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == aims: to verify to what degree reducing capacity is a characterizing parameter of a species, and of the strains themselves within a given species, of lactic acid bacteria. methods and results: eighty-eight strains belonging to 10 species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from traditional italian cheeses were studied for their reduction activity: enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis,  lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus and pediococcus pentosaceus. it was observed that the lactococci reached minimum redox potential  before the lactobacilli. the reduction rate of enterococcus spp. and l. lactis ssp. lactis was higher than that of the streptococci and lactobacillus spp. all the p. pentosaceus strains had poor reduction activity compared with the other species. conclusions: the evolution of the redox potential in milk over a time span of 24 h has been found to be a parameter that characterizes a species: the different courses corresponding to the species in question are clearly evident, and interesting differences can also be noted within the same species. significance and impact of the study: the reduction aptitude of strains might be  used to select and adapt appropriate strains for use as starters for dairy products.

TI  == characterization of mesentericin st99, a bacteriocin produced by leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum st99 isolated from boza.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria isolated from boza, a cereal-fermented beverage from belogratchik, bulgaria, were screened for the production of bacteriocins. with the first screening, 13 of the 52 isolates inhibited the growth of listeria innocua and lactobacillus plantarum. the cell-free supernatant of one of these strains, classified as leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum st99, inhibited the growth of bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, several lactobacillus spp., lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus thermophilus. clostridium spp., carnobacterium spp., l. mesenteroides and gram-negative bacteria were not inhibited. maximum antimicrobial activity, i.e. 6,400 arbitrary units (au)/ml, was recorded in mrs broth after 24 h at 30 degrees c. incubation in the presence of protease iv and pronase e resulted in loss of antimicrobial activity, confirming that growth inhibition was caused by a bacteriocin, designated here as mesentericin st99. no  loss in activity was recorded after treatment with alpha-amylase, sds, tween 20,  tween 80, urea, triton x-100, n-laurylsarcosin, edta and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. mesentericin st99 remained active after 30 min at 121 degrees c and after 2 h of incubation at ph 2 to 12. metabolically active cells of l. innocua treated with mesentericin st99 did not undergo lysis. mesentericin st99 did not adhere to the cell surface of strain st99. precipitation with ammonium sulfate (70% saturation), followed by sep-pack c18 chromatography and reverse-phase hplc on a c18 nucleosil column yielded one antimicrobial peptide.

TI  == two distinct pathways for the formation of hydroxy fa from linoleic acid by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == twenty-three of 86 strains of lactic acid bacteria transformed linoleic acid into hydroxy fa. two distinct conversion pathways were in operation. two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus and a strain of pediococcus pentosaceus produced 13(s)-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid 113(s)-oh 18:11 and 10,13dihydroxyoctadecanoic  acid (10,13-oh 18:0) as main and minor products, respectively, whereas 13 strains, including l. casei subsp. casei, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, l. lactis subsp. cremoris, and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus produced 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid (10-oh 18:1). seven strains of l. plantarum converted linoleic acid to 10-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10-oh 18:0) through 10-oh 18:1. linoleic acid at 2 g/l was converted by l. acidophilus  ifo13951t to 1.3 g of 13(s)-oh 18:1 and 0.09 g of 10,13-oh 18:0 in 7 d. lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei jcm 1111 produced 10-oh 18:1 in 91% yield, and l. plantarum jcm 8341, 10-oh 18:0 in 59% yield from linoleic acid (2 g/l) under optimal conditions. to our knowledge, this is the first report on the  production of 13(s)-oh 18:1 by lactic acid bacteria other than ruminal bacteria,  and of 10,13-oh 18:0 by any bacteria.

TI  == a pcr-based method for identification of lactobacilli at the genus level.
AB  == we developed a polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based method for the identification of lactobacilli at the genus level. one specific primer, lblma1-rev, was designed by analysing similarities between the nucleotide sequence of the spacer between the 16s and 23s rrna genes in a number of lactobacillus strains. amplification with lblma1-rev and r16-1, a universal primer, generated a pcr product for 23 lactobacillus species. electrophoresis did not reveal any discrete bands when escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, streptococcus thermophilus, carnobacterium pissicola,  pediococcus pentosaceus, bifidobacterium bifidum, weissella confusa, enterococcus hirae, staphylococcus aureus or listeria monocytogenes dna were used as template.

TI  == enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  == enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against ent. faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. sake, listeria innocua, propionibacterium acidipropionici, propionibacterium sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium. one of the four pathogenic strains of escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. no  antimicrobial activity was recorded against bacillus cereus, cl. sporogenes, cl.  tyrobutyricum, leuconostoc cremoris, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus carnosus and streptococcus thermophilus. enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees c for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a ph of 1.0-5.0 and ph 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 au ml-1, but increased further to 1600 au ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. the peptide is approximately 3.4 kda in size, as determined after partial purification with amberlite xad-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the mechanism of antimicrobial activity against lact. sake lmg 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.

TI  == conservation of the major cold shock protein in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == primers designed from consensus regions of the major cold shock gene of different bacterial species were used in pcr amplification of lactic acid bacteria (lab). an appropriately-sized pcr product was obtained from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ll43-1 and mg1363; lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris lc10-1, lc11-1, and  lc12-1; streptococcus thermophilus st1-1; enterococcus faecalis ef1-1; lactobacillus acidophilus la1-1; lactobacillus helveticus lh1-1; pediococcus pentosaceus pp1-1; and bifidobacterium animalis ba1-1. the pcr products were cloned and sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequences displayed high sequence similarity with the major cold shock proteins of escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis and the human y-box factor. the amino acid residues of the cold shock domain implicated in nucleic acid binding in several unrelated species were also  highly conserved in the lab strains. it is possible, therefore, that this protein in lab may also act as a transcriptional enhancer to other cold shock genes and/or act as an rna chaperone unwinding tightly folded rna molecules.

TI  == identification of a cold shock gene in lactic acid bacteria and the effect of cold shock on cryotolerance.
AB  == when lactic acid bacterial cultures were frozen at -20 degrees c for 24 h, the cell viability decreased drastically, but when they were cold shocked at 10 degrees c for 2 h prior to freezing, viability improved significantly for the lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis strains (25-37%) and pediococcus pentosaceus po2 (18%), but not for the lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris strains tested or for one strain of lactobacillus helveticus lb1 and streptococcus thermophilus ts2. when the period for cold shock was extended to 5 h, the viability increased even  further for those strains that displayed cold shock cryotolerance. use of degenerate pcr primers based on the major cold shock protein (csp) of both escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis resulted in pcr products from all strains  tested. the pcr product from lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis m474 was cloned and sequenced, and the deduced amino acid sequence displayed a high sequence similarity to other csp's. use of pcr primers based on the m474 sequence resulted in pcr products being produced only from the lactococcal strains studied and not  from the lactobacillus helveticus, streptococcus thermophilus, or pediococcus pentosaceus strains tested.

TI  == the effect of cations on the hydrolysis of lactose and the transferase reactions  catalysed by beta-galactosidase from six strains of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == beta-galactosidases from lactobacillus delbruekii subsp. bulgaricus 20056, lb. casei 20094, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 7962, streptococcus thermophilus ts2, pediococcus pentosaceus pe39 and bifidobacterium bifidum 1901 were partially purified. the rate of hydrolysis of lactose given by the predominant beta-galactosidase activity from each of the bacteria studied was in all cases enhanced by mg2+, while the effect of k+ and na+ differed from strain to strain.  the beta-galactosidases from all strains also catalysed trans-galactosylation reactions. the types of oligosaccharides produced appeared to be very similar in  each case, but the rates of their production differed. all the beta-galactosidases were also capable of hydrolysing galactosyl-lactose although, unlike the other bacteria studied, lb. delbruekii subsp. bulgaricus 20056 and lc. lactis subsp. lactis 7962 were unable to utilise galactosyl-lactose as a carbon source for growth.

TI  == development and characterization of lactose-positive pediococcus species for milk fermentation.
AB  == bacteriophages against streptococcus thermophilus are a growing problem in the italian cheese industry. one possible control method involves replacing s. thermophilus in mozzarella starter blends with lactic acid bacteria from a different genus or species. in this study, we evaluated lactose-positive pediococci for this application. because we could not identify any commercially available pediococci with fast acid-producing ability in milk, we transformed pediococcus pentosaceus atcc 25744, p. pentosaceus atcc 25745, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 12697 by electroporation with ppn-1, a 35-kb lactococcus lactis lactose plasmid. transformants of p. pentosaceus atcc 25745 and p. acidilactici atcc 12697 were then used to examine lactose-positive pediococci for properties related to milk fermentation. both transformants rapidly produced acid and efficiently retained ppn-1 in lactose broth, and neither bacterium was attacked by bacteriophages in whey collected from commercial cheese facilities. paired starter combinations of pediococcus spp. and lactobacillus helveticus lh100 exhibited synergistic ph reduction in milk, and small-scale cheese trials showed  that these cultures could be used to manufacture part-skim mozzarella cheese. results demonstrate that lactose-positive pediococci have potential as replacement cocci for s. thermophilus in italian cheese starter blends and may facilitate development of new strain rotation schemes to combat s. thermophilus bacteriophage problems in mozzarella cheese plants.
