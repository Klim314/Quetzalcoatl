TI  - The influence of fat and monoacylglycerols on growth of spore-forming bacteria in processed cheese.
AB  - Highly undesirable microbial contaminants of processed cheese are endospore-forming bacteria of the genera Bacillus and Clostridium. Survival of Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Clostridium butyricum and C. sporogenes was examined in model processed cheese samples supplemented with monoacylglycerols. In processed cheese samples, monoacylglycerols of undecanoic, undecenoic, lauric and adamantane-1-carboxylic acid at concentration of 0.15% w/w prevented the growth and multiplication of both Bacillus species throughout the storage period. The two species of Clostridium were less affected by monoacylglycerols in processed cheese samples and only partial inhibition was observed. The effect of milk fat content on microbial survival in processed cheese was also evaluated. The growth of Bacillus sp. was affected by the fat level of processed cheese while population levels of Clostridium sp. did not differ in processed cheese samples with 30, 40 and 50% fat in dry matter.
TI  - Occurrence of nisin Z production in Lactococcus lactis BFE 1500 isolated from wara, a traditional Nigerian cheese product.
AB  - Screening for bacteriocin production of 500 strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from various African fermented foods resulted in the detection of a bacteriocin producing Lactococcus lactis (BFE 1500) isolated from a dairy product called wara. The bacteriocin inhibited not only the closely related LAB, but also strains of Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua, Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillis cereus and Staphylococcus aureus. It was heat stable even at autoclaving temperature (121 degrees C for 15 min) and was active over a wide pH range (2-10), but highest activity was observed in the lower pH range. The bacteriocin was inactivated by alpha-chymotrypsin and proteinase K, but not by other proteases. Growth kinetic assay indicated stronger growth inhibition by the bacteriocin produced by Lc. lactis BFE 1500 on L. monocytogenes WS 2250 and B. cereus DSM 2301 than with the nisin A producing strain DSM 20729. Polymerase chain reaction indicated the presence of the nisin operon in strain BFE 1500 and sequencing of its structural gene showed that Lc. lactis BFE 1500 produced the natural nisin variant, nisin Z, as indicated by the substitution of asparagine residue instead of histidine at position 27. The genetic determinants for bacteriocin production in strain BFE 1500 are located on a conjugative transposon. The ability of the bacteriocin produced by Lc. lactis BFE 1500 to inhibit a wide range of food-borne pathogens is of special interest for food safety, especially in the African environment with perennial problems of poor food hygiene.
TI  - Efficacy of oxonia active against selected spore formers.
AB  - Alternatives to hydrogen peroxide are being sought for use in aseptic packaging systems because this sterilant is efficacious at temperatures higher than some of the newer packaging materials can tolerate. Earlier in this century, peracetic acid was known to be bactericidal, sporicidal, and virucidal but was not widely used because of handling, toxicity, and stability problems. Sanitizer suppliers have capitalized on the efficacy of hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid, and peracetic acid stabilized with a sequestering agent. Formulations have been improved and marketed as Oxonia Active, and its use as an alternative sterilant to hydrogen peroxide merits evaluation. Oxonia was assessed at a concentration of 2% and a temperature of 40 degrees C against a number of spore-forming organisms, including foodborne pathogens. Spores tested in aqueous suspension showed an order of sensitivity (least to greatest) to Oxonia as follows: Bacillus cereus > B. subtilis A > B. stearothermophilus > B. subtilis var. globigii > B. coagulans > Clostridium sporogenes (PA3679) > C. butyricum > C. botulinum type B (nonproteolytic) > C. botulinum type B (proteolytic) = C. botulinum type A = C. botulinum type E. B. subtilis A and B. stearothermophilus spores tested in the dry state were less sensitive to Oxonia than when tested in aqueous suspension. B. cereus, a foodborne pathogen, proved to be markedly less sensitive to Oxonia under the described test conditions. The decreased sensitivity to Oxonia by the foodborne pathogen B. cereus raises concern about the efficacy of the sterilant for aseptic packaging of low-acid foods. Further work will be needed to determine if this decreased sensitivity is an inherent property of the organism that affords unusual protection against Oxonia or if the challenge parameters selected were at the minimum conditions for efficacy.
TI  - Nonspecific phospholipase C of Listeria monocytogenes: activity on phospholipids  in Triton X-100-mixed micelles and in biological membranes.
AB  - Listeria monocytogenes secretes a phospholipase C (PLC) which has 39% amino acid  sequence identity with the broad-specificity PLC from Bacillus cereus. Recent work indicates that the L. monocytogenes enzyme plays a role during infections of mammalian cells (J.-A. Vazquez-Boland, C. Kocks, S. Dramsi, H. Ohayon, C. Geoffroy, J. Mengaud, and P. Cossart, Infect. Immun. 60:219-230, 1992). The homogeneous enzyme has a specific activity of 230 mumol/min/mg when phosphatidylcholine (PC) is dispersed in sodium deoxycholate. With phospholipid-Triton X-100 mixed micelles, the enzyme had a broad pH optimum between 5.5 and 8.0, and the rates of lipid hydrolysis were in the following order: PC > phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) > phosphatidylserine > sphingomyelin >> phosphatidylinositol (PI). Activity on PC was stimulated 35% by 0.5 M NaCl and 60% by 0.05 mM ZnSO4. When Escherichia coli phospholipids were dispersed in Triton X-100, PE and phosphatidylglycerol, but not cardiolipin, were hydrolyzed. The enzyme was active on all phospholipids of vesiculated human erythrocytes including PI, which was rapidly hydrolyzed at pH 7.0. PI was also hydrolyzed in PI-PC-cholesterol liposomes by the nonspecific PLC from L. monocytogenes and by the homologous enzyme from B. cereus. The water-soluble hydrolysis product was identified as inositol-1-phosphate. For the hydrolysis of human erythrocyte ghost phospholipids, a broad pH optimum was also observed. 32P-labelled Clostridium butyricum protoplasts, which are rich in ether lipids, were treated with PLC. The enzyme hydrolyzed the plasmalogen form of PE, its glycerol acetal, and cardiolipin, in addition to PE. I-, Cl- and F- stimulated activity on either PC- Triton X-100 mixed micelles or human erythrocyte ghosts, unlike the enzyme from B. cereus which is strongly inhibited by halides. Tris-HCl, phosphate, and calcium nitrate had similar inhibitory effects on the enzyme on the enzymes from L. monocytogenes and B. cereus.
TI  - Selective medium for isolation of Clostridium butyricum from human feces.
AB  - A selective medium, Clostridium butyricum isolation medium (BIM), is described for the isolation of C. butyricum from human feces. The BIM is a synthetic minimal medium and contains trimethoprim (16 micrograms/ml), D-cycloserine (10 micrograms/ml), and polymyxin B sulfate (20 micrograms/ml) as selective inhibitory agents. Qualitative tests indicated that C. butyricum and other butyric acid-producing clostridia grew on BIM, Clostridium sphenoides and Bacillus cereus produced small colonies, and other clostridia and other obligate anaerobic or facultatively anerobic bacteria were inhibited. Quantitative recovery of C. butyricum from cultures or seeded fecal samples was comparable with BIM and with complex medium, but the quantitative recovery of the other butyric acid-producing clostridia tested (C. beijerinckii, C. acetobutylicum) was lower with BIM than with complex medium. The BIM should aid the rapid isolation of C. butyricum from fecal samples and should be useful for bacteriological investigation of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis.
