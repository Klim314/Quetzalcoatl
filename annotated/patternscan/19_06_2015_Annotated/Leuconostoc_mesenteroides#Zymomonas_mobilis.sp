TI  == nonstatistical 13c distribution during carbon transfer from glucose to ethanol during fermentation is determined by the catabolic pathway exploited.
AB  == during the anaerobic fermentation of glucose to ethanol, the three micro-organisms saccharomyces cerevisiae, zymomonas mobilis, and leuconostoc mesenteroides exploit, respectively, the embden-meyerhof-parnas, the entner-doudoroff, and the reductive pentose phosphate pathways. thus, the atoms incorporated into ethanol do not have the same affiliation to the atomic positions in glucose. the isotopic fractionation occurring in each pathway at both the methylene and methyl positions of ethanol has been investigated by isotopic quantitative (13)c nmr spectrometry with the aim of observing whether an isotope redistribution characteristic of the enzymes active in each pathway can be measured. first, it is found that each pathway has a unique isotope redistribution signature. second, for the methylene group, a significant apparent kinetic isotope effect is only found in the reductive pentose phosphate pathway.  third, the apparent kinetic isotope effects related to the methyl group are more  pronounced than for the methylene group. these findings can (i) be related to known kinetic isotope effects of some of the enzymes concerned and (ii) give indicators as to which steps in the pathways are likely to be influencing the final isotopic composition in the ethanol.

TI  == pre-treatment step with leuconostoc mesenteroides or l. pseudomesenteroides strains removes furfural from zymomonas mobilis ethanolic fermentation broth.
AB  == furfural is an inhibitor of growth and ethanol production by zymomonas mobilis. this study used a naturally occurring (not gmo) biological pre-treatment to reduce that amount of furfural in a model fermentation broth. pre-treatment involved inoculating and incubating the fermentation broth with strains of leuconostoc mesenteroides or leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides. the leuconostoc strains converted furfural to furfuryl alcohol without consuming large amounts of dextrose in the process. coupling this pre-treatment to ethanolic fermentation reduced furfural in the broth and improved growth, dextrose uptake and ethanol formation. pre-treatment permitted ethanol formation in the presence of 5.2 g l(-1) furfural, which was otherwise inhibitive. the pre-treatment and presence of the leuconostoc strains in the fermentation broth did not interfere with z. mobilis ethanolic fermentation or the amounts of ethanol produced. the method suggests a possible technique for reducing the effect that furfural has on the production of ethanol for use as a biofuel.

TI  == analysis of bacterial community during the fermentation of pulque, a traditional  mexican alcoholic beverage, using a polyphasic approach.
AB  == in this study, the characterization of the bacterial community present during the fermentation of pulque, a traditional mexican alcoholic beverage from maguey (agave), was determined for the first time by a polyphasic approach in which both culture and non-culture dependent methods were utilized. the work included the isolation of lactic acid bacteria (lab), aerobic mesophiles, and 16s rdna clone libraries from total dna extracted from the maguey sap (aguamiel) used as substrate, after inoculation with a sample of previously produced pulque and followed by 6-h fermentation. microbiological diversity results were correlated with fermentation process parameters such as sucrose, glucose, fructose and fermentation product concentrations. in addition, medium rheological behavior analysis and scanning electron microscopy in aguamiel and during pulque fermentation were also performed. our results showed that both culture and non-culture dependent approaches allowed the detection of several new and previously reported species within the alpha-, gamma-proteobacteria and firmicutes. bacteria diversity in aguamiel was composed by the heterofermentative leuconostoc citreum, l. mesenteroides, l. kimchi, the gamma-proteobacteria erwinia rhapontici, enterobacter spp. and acinetobacter radioresistens. inoculation with previously fermented pulque incorporated to the system microbiota, homofermentative lactobacilli related to lactobacillus acidophilus, several alpha-proteobacteria such as zymomonas mobilis and acetobacter malorum, other gamma-proteobacteria and an important amount of yeasts, creating a starting metabolic diversity composed by homofermentative and heterofermentative lab, acetic and ethanol producing microorganisms. at the end of the fermentation process, the bacterial diversity was mainly composed by the homofermentative lactobacillus acidophilus, the heterofermentative l. mesenteroides, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and the alpha-proteobacteria a. malorum. after a 6-h fermentation, 83.27% of total sugars detected after inoculation were consumed (228.4 mm hexose equivalents) and a carbon (c) recovery of 66.18% in fermentation products was estimated. they were produced 284.4 mm c as ethanol, 71.5 mm c as acetic acid and 19 mm c as lactic acid, demonstrating the presence of homo- and heterofermentative, acetic and alcoholic metabolisms in the final product. it was also found, after hydrolysis, that the exopolysaccharide produced during the fermentation was mainly composed by fructose residues, probably inulin or levan.

TI  == distribution of epiphytic bacteria on olive leaves and the influence of leaf age  and sampling time.
AB  == mesophilic heterotrophic, aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria that grow on yeast tryptone glucose extract agar were isolated from the surface of olive leaves of 3 or 4 different ages in january, april, july, and october from 1984 to 1989. unweighted average linkage cluster analysis on either the jaccard coefficient or the simple matching coefficient recovered 1,701 representative strains in 32 phena defined at the 70% and 80% similarity level, respectively. of these, 25 were identified to genus or lower level. from the identity of the representative strains, the frequency of occurrence among the phylloplane bacteria over the 6-year period was estimated at 51% forpseudomonas syringae, followed byxanthomonas campestris (6.7%),erwinia herbicola (6%),acetobacter aceti (4.7%),gluconobacter oxydans (4.3%),pseudomonas fluorescens (3.9%),bacillus megaterium (3.8%),leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp.dextranicum (3.1%),lactobacillus plantarum (2.8%),curtobacterium plantarum (2.2%),micrococcus luteus (2.2%),arthrobacter globiformis (1.4%),klebsiella planticola (1.2%),streptococcus faecium (1.2%),clavibacter sp. (0.98%),micrococcus sp. (0.82%),serratia marcescens (0.81%),bacillus subtilis (0.57%),cellulomonas flavigena (0.4%),erwinia sp. (0.37%),zymomonas mobilis (0.3%),bacillus sp. (0.29%),alcaligenes faecalis (0.27%),erwinia carotovora (0.08%), andpseudomonas aeruginosa (0.04%). bacterial communities on leaves of a given age at a given time during any one year displayed a very similar structure but differed significantly from those on the leaves of the same age at a different time or on  the leaves of a different age at any time during any one year. communities on the leaves of a given age at a given time of the year were invariably dominated by one or another of only 9 taxa, which accounted for 22 to 98.5% of the isolates from those leaves. the communities on 10- and 13-month-old leaves were invariably made up of fewer taxa than those on younger leaves at the same time of the year.
