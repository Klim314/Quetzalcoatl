TI  == reduction of teat skin mastitis pathogen loads: differences between strains, dips, and contact times.
AB  == the purpose of these experiments was to (1) assess differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to teat disinfectants (teat dips), and (2) determine the optimum time for premilking teat dips to remain in contact with teat skin to reduce pathogen loads on teat skin. two experiments were conducted using the excised teat model. in experiment 1, the differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to 4 commercially available dips (dip a: 1% h2o2; dip b: 1% chlorine dioxide; dip c: 1% iodophor; and dip d: 0.5% iodophor) were evaluated. four strains of 11 common mastitis pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, mycoplasma bovis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus hyicus, staphylococcus xylosus, and staphylococcus haemolyticus) were tested. in experiment 2, the percentage log reduction of mastitis pathogens (escherichia coli, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, klebsiella species, staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus xylosus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) on teat skin with 3 commercially available teat dips: dip a; dip d;  and dip e: 0.25% iodophor, using dip contact times of 15, 30, and 45 s, was evaluated. experiment 1 results indicated significant differences in strain sensitivities to dips within pathogen species: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus chromogenes, and streptococcus uberis. species differences were also found where mycoplasma bovis (97.9% log reduction) was the most sensitive to tested teat dips and staphylococcus haemolyticus (71.4% log reduction) the most resistant. experiment 2 results indicated that contact times of 30 and 45 s were  equally effective in reducing recovered bacteria for dips d and e and were also significantly more effective than a 15-s contact time. no differences were seen in recovered bacteria between tested contact times after treatment with dip a. it can be concluded that different mastitis pathogen species and strains within species may possess different sensitivities to teat dips, which may have implications in selection of teat dips on dairies. furthermore, a 30-s premilking dip contact time for iodophors and 15 s for h2o2 dips may be optimal in reducing  pathogen load in the shortest amount of time. a reduction in premilking teat dip  contact time may improve milking parlor efficiency.

TI  == a study on the nature of association between demodex mites and bacteria involved  in skin and meibomian gland lesions of demodectic mange in cattle.
AB  == the nature of association between demodex mites and bacteria involved in bovine demodectic mange lesions and the normal flora inhabiting the skin of noninfected  animals was investigated. demodex bovis and d. ghanensis mites were isolated from the infected purulent material extracted from skin and meibomian gland lesions, respectively. the mites could not be demonstrated in skin brushings or impression smears from the eyes of noninfected cattle. pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes (group a)) and opportunistic organisms (proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and trueperella pyogenes) were isolated from skin lesions of demodectic mange, and moraxella bovis and staphylococcus aureus were isolated from meibomian gland lesions. bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes (group a) were isolated from skin brushings from noninfected cattle. the nature of association between demodex mites and bacteria in demodectic mange lesions is synergistic and of equal significance. pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria facilitated the establishment of demodex mites in the lesions produced and provided an excellent  microclimate for the mites to propagate and reproduce, resulting in severe and progressive disease. the "high-turnover" granulomatous reaction which characterized the histopathological changes proved that demodex mites and associated bacteria were persistent and immunogenic.

TI  == combined computed tomography and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography  in the diagnosis of prosthetic valve endocarditis: a case series.
AB  == background: the diagnosis of prosthetic valve endocarditis is challenging. the gold standard for prosthetic valve endocarditis diagnosis is trans-esophageal echocardiography. however, trans-esophageal echocardiography may result in negative findings or yield images difficult to differentiate from thrombus in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis. combined computed tomography and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography is a potentially promising diagnostic tool for several infectious conditions and it has also been employed in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis but data are still scant. case presentations: we reviewed the charts of 6 patients with prosthetic aortic valves evaluated for suspicion of prosthetic valve endocarditis, at two different hospital, over a 3-year period. we found 3 patients with early-onset pve cases and blood cultures yielding pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus lugdunensis, respectively; and 3 late-onset cases in the remaining 3 patients with isolation in the blood of streptococcus bovis, candida  albicans and p. aeruginosa, respectively. initial trans-esophageal echocardiography was negative in all the patients, while fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed images suspicious for prosthetic valve endocarditis. in 4 out of 6 patients valve replacement was done with histology confirming the prosthetic valve endocarditis diagnosis. after an adequate course  of antibiotic therapy fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed resolution of prosthetic valve endocarditis in all the patients. conclusion: our  experience confirms the potential role of fluoroseoxyglucose positron emission tomography in the diagnosis and follow-up of prosthetic valve endocarditis.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == effect on quarter milk somatic cell count and antimicrobial susceptibility of staphylococcus rostri causing intramammary infection in dairy water buffaloes.
AB  == in many parts of the world, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) are the predominant cause of intramammary infections (imi) in dairy cows and in water buffaloes, as well. a longitudinal field study was carried out on one well-managed dairy water buffalo herd to determine the prevalence and distribution of cns and a recently described cns-species, staphylococcus rostri,  in milk samples to explore its relevance for buffaloes' udder health throughout lactation, and to gain insight into the susceptibility of the latter species toward commonly used antimicrobials. twice weekly quarter milk samples from a cohort of 11 lactating water buffaloes were collected over an 8-mo period. the cns (n=109; 76.2% of all culture-positive samples) were the predominant pathogens causing imi, followed by corynebacterium bovis (n=11; 7.6%) and streptococcus spp. (n=9; 6.2%) other than stretococcus uberis (n=2; 1.4%). thirty-seven hemolytic staphylococci suspected to be staphylococcus aureus were further differentiated using transfer dna-intergenic spacer-pcr and rpob-gene sequencing  because they were coagulase-negative. thirty-three of those isolates were identified as staph. rostri, whereas 2 others were identified as staphylococcus epidermidis. none of the staph. rostri isolates displayed resistance to the antimicrobial agents tested. mean quarter milk somatic cell count (qscc) of all samples collected throughout lactation was 20,970 cells/ml. the qscc at sampling  of quarters infected with staph. rostri (34,466 cells/ml) and cns other than staph. rostri (34,813 cells/ml) were significantly higher than the qscc of noninfected quarters (20,287 cells/ml), yet not significantly different from each other. these findings provide novel insight into the prevalence and distribution, antimicrobial susceptibility, and relevance of staph. rostri compared with other  cns species causing imi in water buffaloes. further studies are needed to pinpoint the relevance, niches, and transmission routes of staph. rostri, as well as other cns in water buffaloes.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == ability of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 to participate in bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelial barrier.
AB  == although hundreds of microbial species reside in the human intestinal tract, comparatively few (e.g., escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, enterococcus  faecalis, etc.) are typically associated with systemic infection in postsurgical, shock, and trauma patients. syndecan-1 is the predominant cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on epithelia, and there is substantial evidence that heparan sulfate participates in interactions of a variety of frankly pathogenic microbes with mammalian cells. to investigate the role of syndecan-1 in interactions of enteric flora with intestinal epithelium, bacteria that might  use the enterocyte as a portal of entry for systemic infection (including e. faecalis, e. coli, and other enterobacteria, and several species of staphylococci and streptococci) were studied for their abilities to interact with syndecan-1. streptococcus bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis showed increased adherence to arh-77 cells transfected to express syndecan-1. heparin, a heparan sulfate analog, inhibited internalization of s. bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, and s. aureus by ht-29 enterocytes (prominent  syndecan-1 expression), but not caco-2 enterocytes (relatively low syndecan-1 expression). data from experiments with chinese hamster ovary cells with altered  glycosaminoglycan expression indicated that heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (glycosaminoglycans on the syndecan-1 ectodomain) participated in bacterial interactions with mammalian cells. thus, although e. faecalis, e. coli, and other gram-negative enterobacteria did not appear to interact with syndecan-1, this heparan sulfate proteoglycan may mediate enterocyte interactions with some staphylococci and streptococci that are known to cause systemic infections in specific populations of high-risk, immunosuppressed, postsurgical,  and trauma patients.

TI  == [study on treatment strategy for ventriculitis associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus].
AB  == objective: to study the treatment strategy for ventriculitis associated with ventriculo peritoneal shunt for hydrocephalus. methods: for all of the patients suspected to have cerebrospinal fluid (csf) infections, the first step of treatment was removal of the "infected" shunts, then a ventricular drainage was placed in frontal horn of the ventricle, and at the same time csf was obtained from the ventricle for bacterial culture and tests of bacterial sensitivities to  antibiotics. after the shunt removal and before the result from bacterial cultures was obtained, 25-50 mg of vancomycin was administered intraventricularly daily. as soon as the result from bacterial cultures was obtained, antibiotics should be adjusted according to the sensitivity test result. by the time of the infections being controlled, appropriate treatments including reshunting would finally be given for hydrocephalus if necessary. results: among 11 patients, 9 were infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci or staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus, one of them with concomitant infection of aerobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacteriaceae aerogenesis, 1 patient with streptococci, and another one with mycobacterium stercoris bovis. the tests of drug sensitivity showed that cocci in infection of 9 patients were all sensitive  to vancomycin, but only 1 of them sensitive to gentamycin. there were other sensitive antibiotics for streptococcus in 1 case and for bacillus in 2 patients. practically vancomycin was effective for 8 of 11 patients, including one case of  streptococcal infection. the duration for anti-infection treatment was in a range of 16-36 days. finally, all of 11 patients survived from the shunt ventriculitis, and 9 of them had significant improvement in their neurological functions. conclusion: (1)intraventricular administration of proper antibiotics is a reliable and effective way to treat ventriculitis associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunts. (2)vancomycin is the preferred antibiotic for ventriculitis, but other kind(s) of some antibiotics are necessary in a few patients in addition to or instead of vancomycin. (3)the effect of systemic use of antibiotics could not be defined in this series of patients, but this may be used as an adjunct in the practice. (4)there are many problems related to diagnosis and treatment of shunt ventriculitis that should be studied more extensively and deeply.

TI  == the replicon of the cryptic plasmid psbo1 isolated from streptococcus bovis jb1.
AB  == the cryptic plasmid psbo1 (3904 bp) was isolated from streptococcus bovis jb1. psbo1 contained an open reading frame (orf) that is homologous to sequences encoding the replication protein (rep) in pefc1 (isolated from enterococcus faecalis), psk639 (staphylococcus epidermidis), pla103 (lactobacillus acidophilus), and pucl287 (tetragenococcus halophila). in addition, four 22-bp direct repeats (drs) were located upstream of the putative replication gene (rep) of psbo1. recombinant plasmids (psbe10 and psbe11) containing the drs and putative rep of psbo1 replicated in s. bovis 12-u-1 and no8 strains. this result  indicates that the putative rep encoded rep and that the replicon of psbo1 contained the drs and the rep. gel shift assays showed that the rep of psbo1 bound the 22-bp drs.

TI  == infective endocarditis in patients receiving long-term hemodialysis.
AB  == objective: to ascertain the predominant characteristics of patients receiving long-term dialysis who develop infective endocarditis (ie). patients and methods: we reviewed the records of all chronic hemodialysis patients who had ie at mayo clinic, rochester, minn, between 1983 and 1997. results: twenty episodes of ie occurred in 17 patients. one patient had 3 episodes of ie, and 1 patient had 2 episodes of ie; each episode was caused by a different organism. the mean +/- sd  age of our patients was 63 +/- 11 years; there were 13 males; 6 patients had diabetes mellitus; and the mean +/- sd duration of hemodialysis prior to ie was 24.2 +/- 20.5 months. this analysis included 10 episodes of ie (occurring in 9 patients) within the mayo clinic dialysis system during which time 223,358 hemodialysis treatments were delivered, giving a rate of 10 ie episode per 223,336 hemodialysis treatments. among all 20 ie episodes, there were 14 synthetic arteriovenous grafts, 4 permanent venous dialysis catheters, 2 temporary venous dialysis catheters, and 2 native arteriovenous fistulas (2 accesses in 2 patients), and access had been in place for a mean +/- sd of 15.9 +/- 18.6 months. the portal of infection was the hemodialysis access in 13 episodes of ie. the causative organisms for ie were staphylococcus aureus in 8 cases, enterococcus sp in 4 cases, viridans streptococcus in 3 cases, staphylococcus epidermidis in 2 cases, and 1 case each of streptococcus bovis, group g beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and aspergillus sp. the mitral valve was involved in 9 cases, the aortic valve was involved in 5 cases, and the tricuspid  and pulmonic valves were involved in 1 case each. patient survival (after the first episode of ie) was 71% at 30 days; 53% at 60 days; and 35% at 1 year. echocardiography was performed in 19 episodes of ie. the transthoracic echocardiogram was 62.5% sensitive and 40% specific for the presence of definite  or probable vegetations. univariate analysis for factors affecting 60-day survival show that presence of right-sided ie, vegetation size greater than 2.0 cm3, diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, and initial leukocyte count greater than 12.5 x 10(9)/l were poor prognostic factors. aortic valve involvement carried a better prognosis. conclusions: infective endocarditis in hemodialysis patients is relatively infrequent but has a high mortality. patients with synthetic intravascular dialysis angioaccess (synthetic grafts and venous catheters) are more likely to develop ie than patients with native arteriovenous fistulas. transesophageal echocardiography is a preferred echocardiographic study for suspected cases of ie. prolonged antibiotic therapy is needed for all patients, and close monitoring is needed for patients with right-sided ie, large vegetations, diabetes mellitus, and an elevated leukocyte count.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 gram-positive microorganisms. the mic(90) (mg/l) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus anginosus and actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for streptococcus sanguis and listeria monocytogenes, 2 for corynebacterium jekeium and bifidobacterium bivius. over 50% of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium,  quinolone-resistant staphylococci, nocardia steroides and clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/l moxifloxacin. moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against gram-positive bacilli.

TI  == molecular and physiological characterization of dominant bacterial populations in traditional mozzarella cheese processing
AB  == the development of the dominant bacterial populations during traditional mozzarella cheese production was investigated using physiological analyses and molecular techniques for strain typing and taxonomic identification. analysis of  rapd fingerprints revealed that the dominant bacterial community was composed of  25 different biotypes, and the sequence analysis of 16s rdna demonstrated that the isolated strains belonged to leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides,  leuc. lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, strep. bovis, strep. uberis, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, l. garviae, carnobacterium divergens, c. piscicola, aerococcus viridans, staphylococcus carnosus, staph. epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, ent. sulphureus and enterococcus spp. the bacterial populations were characterized for their physiological properties. two strains, belonging to strep. thermophilus and l. lactis subsp. lactis, were the most acidifying; thel. lactis subsp. lactis strain was also proteolytic and eight strains were positive to citrate fermentation. moreover, the molecular techniques allowed the identification of potential pathogens in a non-ripened cheese produced from raw milk.

TI  == [investigations on the behavior of c-reactive protein, cell count, lactose content as well as electric conductivity in quarter milk samples of subclinically diseased quarters of the udders in relation to bacteriologic results].
AB  == inflammations of the udder influence the amount of somatic cells and lactose as well as electrical conductivity in milk. they are often caused by bacterial agents. similar reactions are to be seen in relation to c-reactive protein (crp). the amount of crp in milk depends on concentration and characteristics of the agents and the phase of inflammation. we found a significant increase of crp in milk samples with streptococcus (sc.) uberis. there was no significant difference in crp concentrations in samples with coagulase positive staphylococcus spp. (cps) and bacteriological negative samples and such with corynebacterium (c.) bovis, micrococcus spp. and staphylococcus (s.) epidermidis. we only found high correlations to the amount of somatic sells and lactose as well as electrical conductivity in samples with sc. uberis. the results of our investigations show that crp may be a parameter for better understanding subclinical inflammations of udder.

AB  == strain differentiation of staphylococcus species, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, and candida species was performed by restriction endonuclease analysis (rea) of genomic dna with hinfi or haeiii followed by conventional agarose gel electrophoresis. rea of 19 methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates and 19 methicillin-susceptible s. aureus isolates revealed 8, and 14 patterns, respectively. fifty-three isolates of s. epidermidis were divided into 39 groups on the basis of rea pattern. rea patterns obtained from different strains of the same species were more similar than those  from different staphylococcus species. a total of 67 patterns were noted among 215 s. pneumoniae isolates. there was some correlation between the rea patterns and serotypes. in addition, all 61 isolates showing the pattern 6 (serotype 19) were penicillin-resistant. sixteen isolates of e. coli o157 and 18 isolates of e. coli o25 were analyzed by rea with haeiii. among 14 epidemiologically unrelated e. coli o157:h7 isolates, rea patterns were either identical or differed only by  a few fragment bands. rea patterns of 7 isolates of heat stable enterotoxin producing e. coli o25 from an outbreak were identical. eight distinct rea patterns were noted among 7 toxigenic c. difficile strains, and one to two strains were included in each group. candida strains belonging to different six candida species were analysed by rea. all c. albicans isolates (148 strains) showed one to four bright bands ranging from 4 to 8kb in size, and these strains  were divided into 37 groups according to the rea patterns. each candida strain showed species-specific rea patterns. twenty-one isolates of mycobacterium tuberculosis complex were analyzed by pcr with primer complementary to the inverted repeat of is6110(is6110-pcr). the results of pcr of 19 m. tuberculosis isolates and 2 m. bovis bcg isolates revealed 15 patterns, and 1 pattern, respectively. our results demonstrated that rea of genomic dna with hinfi or haeiii was a useful tool for strain differentiation. by comparing the species-specific rea patterns of reference strains, clinical isolates of candida  and staphylococci could be identified to the species level if they could not be identified by routine biochemical methods. because is6110-pcr is simple and rapid to perform, it seems to be a good screening method to differentiate m. tuberculosis strains.

TI  == efficacy and safety of vancomycin constant-rate infusion in the treatment of chronic gram-positive bone and joint infections.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vancomycin constant-rate infusion over 24 h in the treatment of gram-positive bone infections, methods: vancomycin (40 mg/kg/day) was administered without a loading dose to 15 patients  (12 male, three female) aged 23--90 years, weighing 46--85 kg, with postoperative chronic bone and joint infections. the 24-h dose was adjusted to maintain plasma  levels between 25 and 35 mg/l. mean duration of therapy was 6.2 months (4--8.5) via a portable infusion pump. sites of infection included hip and femur (10), tibia (three), patella (one) and vertebrae (one). sequestrectomy (two), removal of material (7/8 prosthetic hips, 1/5 metal implants) and debridement (two) were  performed at the beginning of the treatment. involved bacteria included staphylococcus aureus (eight, six methicillin resistant), s. epidermidis (four methicillin-resistant), enterococcus faecalis (one), enterococcus avium (one) and streptococcus bovis (one). results: mic of vancomycin ranged from 1 to 4 mg/l. the mean vancomycin bone concentration when available was 67.7plus minus38.9 microg/l. based on a mean post-treatment follow-up of 14plus minus4 months (6--20.6), cure was achieved in 10 patients (66.6%). failures were related to the inability to remove the infected prosthesis (one) or implants (three) and to the  persistence of a deep wound abcess (one). adverse events included pruritus (four  cases), tinnitus (two), mild transient elevation of creatinine level (three) and  transient neutropenia (two). vancomycin was maintained in all the patients. conclusions: prolonged treatment with vancomycin constant-rate infusion is effective and safe for treatment of gram-positive chronic bone and joint infections, providing that complete surgical debridement and prosthetic material  removal are performed.

AB  == between 1977 and 1992, 30 consecutive episodes of infective endocarditis in 28 patients involving pericardial bioprostheses were diagnosed and treated in our hospital. eleven (37%) were early pericardial valve endocarditis occurring in the first 60 days following valve surgery, and 19 (63%) were late endocarditis. in both the early and late groups, more aortic that mitral valves were affected (19/30). the most frequent pathogen in the early cases was staphylococcus, (s. epidermidis in five cases, s. aureus in one). the most frequent pathogen among late cases was streptococcus: (st. viridans in four, st. faecalis in two, st. bovis in one). in four cases (13%) no pathogen was isolated. twelve patients received antibiotic treatment alone, six specific for the pathogen and other six  only arbitrarily chosen regimen. all patients were cured in the former and all patients died in the latter group (four with negative blood cultures and two in whom identification of the pathogen was delayed-proteus mirabillis in one case and brucella mellitensis in the other). valve replacement during the infective endocarditis episode was necessary in 18 cases, either because of failure of the  antibiotic treatment or because of heart failure secondary to prosthetic malfunction. peri-annular abscess was present in five cases. surgical mortality was 22.2% (4/18). in all, 11 patients (39%) died during the active stage of infective endocarditis. the most frequent cause of death was heart failure (45.5%). all four patients with negative blood cultures died. the most advisable  strategy for treating bacterial endocarditis of pericardial bioprostheses is a combination of antibiotic therapy and early surgery, especially in cases of staphylococcus endocarditis.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the efficacy of teicoplanin in the treatment of endocarditis caused by gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == twenty-six patients with endocarditis caused by streptococcus viridans (n = 12),  enterococcus faecalis (n = 5), streptococcus bovis (n = 2), staphylococcus aureus (n = 3) and staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 4) were treated with teicoplanin at a dose of 600 mg/day in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance 80-120 ml/min) and at a dose of 400 mg/day in patients with moderately impaired renal function (creatinine clearance < 75 ml/min). in nine patients valve replacements were performed. twenty-one patients were cured by medical treatment  with teicoplanin, five patients had a surgical intervention during treatment which was subsequently stopped. overall, eighteen patients with native valve endocarditis were cured. out of eight patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis six patients were cured. in one patient teicoplanin therapy was withdrawn because of clinical failure. one patient had a clinical relapse. all cultures taken from  blood, endocardium and excised artificial valves were sterile after a minimum of  seven days therapy. side effects were seen in seven patients and included a moderate increase in liver enzymes and mild leucopenia. no renal toxicity was observed, trough serum levels of teicoplanin were not correlated with renal function, a slight accumulation of teicoplanin on day 28 being seen. our study confirms that teicoplanin is effective as single agent therapy in the treatment of endocarditis due to gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == the efficacy and safety of piperacillin/tazobactam in the therapy of bacteraemia.
AB  == the efficacy of the combination of piperacillin plus tazobactam was studied in 142 patients who had a bacteriologically proven bacteraemia. seventy-three patients were bacteriologically evaluable and, of these, 55 had a follow-up blood culture; there was no follow-up culture in the other 18 patients, so that any cure could only be presumptive. of the 55 patients who were fully followed up, 32 received only piperacillin and tazobactam and 23 also received an aminoglycoside. overall, there were 67 cures and six failures out of 73 evaluable cases (three staphylococcus aureus, two staphylococcus epidermidis and one streptococcus bovis). there were 11 deaths, eight of which occurred in neutropenic patients. in no case was death drug related. side-effects were mild; the commonest adverse events noted were mild elevations of liver enzymes. piperacillin plus tazobactam  appeared efficacious and safe in the therapy of bacteraemia.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new oral cephalosporin bay  v 3522.
AB  == the activity of the new oral cephalosporin bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to mics of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. it was more active against streptococcus pyogenes (mic less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. groups b, c and g streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the mi"90 for streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for enterococci and listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most bacteroides spp. were resistant. the mic90 for beta-lactamase positive escherichia coli (producing primarily tem-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. the mic90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. the mic90 for moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, proteus  mirabilis, providencia spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. bay v 3522 was destroyed by tem-1, shv-1, tem-3 and p99 beta-lactamases.

TI  == [milk chloride level as an indicator of bovine mastitis].
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine an influence of udder infection on milk chloride level and on milk productivity of cows of black and white race. bacteriological analysis was performed by bacterial isolation from milk collected in sterile conditions from single lobes of mammary gland. the study was aimed to  detect the following bacteria: streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, actinomyces pyogenes, enterobacteriaceae rods, corynebacterium bovis, and micrococcus sp. milk chloride level was determined by burette method in 1250 milk samples collected from entire udder. milk productivity was determined on the day  of bacterial isolation. statistical analysis of the results of the study on udder infection, milk chloride level, and milk productivity of mammary gland did reveal lack of a simple correlations between those parameters and in the indirect manner indicated an influence of inappropriate maintenance conditions of tested cows on  the health condition of their udder. it seems possible that alkalosis and acidosis in cows, taken into consideration in discussion section, could constitute a factor influencing the frequency of mastitis incidence.

TI  == electrophoretic analysis of ureases in streptococcus salivarius and in saliva.
AB  == experimental conditions were established for the extraction, electrophoresis and  detection of urease isoenzymes from streptococcus salivarius. thiol concentrations were critical and ureases from different strains varied in ease of dissociation. a characteristic pattern was obtained for 30 ureolytic s. salivarius strains isolated from; saliva (6), dental plaque (12), artificial dental plaque (6) and non-oral sources (6), and also for a ureolytic streptococcus bovis from artificial plaque. one non-oral s. salivarius strain had ureases with slightly slower mobility. the electrophoretic pattern and mobility of ureases extracted from human mixed salivary bacteria were identical to those from s. salivarius except for an additional set of urease bands from unknown species of bacteria. there were no ureases from saliva matching those from staphylococcus epidermidis--a contributor to ureolysis in artificial plaque. we conclude that there is considerable biochemical homogeneity among s. salivarius ureases and possibly other ureolytic streptococci. in saliva, urea is metabolized mainly by streptococcal ureases.

TI  == the bacteria responsible for ureolysis in artificial dental plaque.
AB  == the origin of ureolytic activity in artificial-mouth plaques was established by assessing the contribution to plaque ureolytic activity of the isolated bacteria. to overcome losses of ureolytic activity caused by the unstable presence of urease in oral bacteria, ureolytic bacteria were isolated from an exceptionally active plaque (1 mumol nh3/min per mg protein) in which 63 per cent of the flora  was ureolytic. after their ability to metabolize urea was stabilized, 13 ureolytic bacteria remained: seven strains of streptococcus salivarius, one streptococcus bovis, two staphylococcus epidermidis and three staphylococcus haemolyticus. their urease activity, measured after growth into stationary phase, was reproducible and strain specific with a 20-fold range within each genus. the  mean ureolytic activity of each species, when weighted by its calculated incidence in the original plaque, accounted for 40 per cent of the total plaque ureolytic activity. however, these values for urease levels were only a small fraction of the bacterial ureolytic potential. urease per mg cell protein measured during the growth cycle of a selected strep. salivarius, and staph. epidermidis, varied 10-fold, and reached much higher activities (i.e. 6-8 mumol nh3/min per mg of cell protein) than under the growth conditions that were used to assess the contribution of these species to total plaque ureolysis. thus urea  metabolism in artificial plaque was due mainly to strep. salivarius, with a small contribution from staph. epidermidis. the presence of further unidentified species of ureolytic oral bacteria need not be invoked.

TI  == bactericidal activity of teicoplanin in an in-vitro two-compartment kinetic model.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of teicoplanin was studied in a model system in which antibiotic concentration is continuously varied. a two-compartment open model was used to reproduce, in vitro serum pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin in humans during 24 h after iv administration. staphylococcal and streptococcal strains of  various species were tested. teicoplanin showed rapid killing of staphylococcus epidermidis and staph. hominis. all strains of staph. epidermidis were rapidly killed in spite of the high mic values (4-16 mg/l). the killing effect against staph. haemolyticus was less rapid and marked than against staph. epidermidis, with strain to strain variation. a 99.9% kill was achieved for most strains within 22 h, but with other isolates regrowth occurred which was due to the presence of highly resistant cells in the original population. other staphylococci (staph. aureus, staph. saprophyticus) and streptococcus pyogenes, str. bovis and str. salivarius were reduced by 99.9% within 22 h. bactericidal activity against other streptococci (str. mutans, str. agalactiae, str. faecalis, str. faecium) was less marked; against str. sanguis teicoplanin was bacteriostatic.

AB  == immunocytochemical studies using antisera to whole human choriogonadotropin (hcg), to its alpha- and beta-subunits and to the cooh-terminal peptide of hcg beta, and two monoclonal antibodies to hcg beta, demonstrated expression of hcg-like material, its individual subunits and/or fragments in nine bacterial strains. seven of these were isolated from patients with cancer and were definitely identified as streptococcus faecalis (three strains), staphylococcus haemolyticus (two strains) and staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli (single strains). the other two strains were cell-wall-deficient (cwd) variants,  one identified as streptococcus bovis, isolated from the blood of a patient with  a fever of unknown origin and a possible brain abscess. the other was a gram-negative diphtheroid isolated from the urine of a pregnant woman, which during the period of study reverted to a gram-positive corynebacterium identified as a 'c. ulcerans' strain and expressed the hcg-like factor only during its phase as gram-negative diphtheroid. electron microscopy of these nine strains (including negative controls of strains of the same species subjected to the same immunocytochemical analyses and under identical cultural conditions) revealed morphological alterations in the bacterial cell walls and cytoplasmic material and/or bizarre forms of reproduction in six of the nine strains expressing hcg-like material including the two cwd variants. collectively, these results provided evidence that (1) hcg-producing bacteria isolated from patients with overt cancer are not a new and unique species as claimed by others, and (2) there is a close resemblance between the bacterial protein and the human trophoblastic  hormone, based on immunochemical recognition of different parts of the hcg molecule.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == mode of action and in-vitro activity of vancomycin.
AB  == vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. it also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. there is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits  ribonucleic acid synthesis. induction of bacterial l-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. stable l-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to  vancomycin. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant  strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), str. pyogenes, str. agalactiae, str. bovis, str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species and lactobacillus species. there has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against staph. aureus, str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. the combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of staph. epidermidis. it shows indifference against enterococci. vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against staph. aureus.

TI  == mannitol agar for microbiologic diagnosis of bovine mastitis.
AB  == a medium containing mannitol (mannitol agar) was developed and evaluated as a tool for the microbiologic diagnosis of bovine mastitis. mannitol agar supported  growth of all important bacterial mastitis pathogens (staphylococci, streptococci, coliforms, and pseudomonads) except corynebacterium pyogenes. color change around colonies in the agar permitted the differentiation of pathogenic from nonpathogenic staphylococci. most staphylococcus aureus strains and some staphylococcus epidermidis strains produced yellow zones. these yellow zone-producing strains (mannitol fermenters) of staphylococci were obtained from  quarters with significantly elevated (p less than 0.05) somatic cell counts (scc) in the milk, as compared with uninfected quarters and, therefore, would be considered pathogens. mannitol-negative strains of s epidermidis (those with red  zones) were obtained from quarters with scc similar to those of uninfected quarters. the streptococci could be divided into 2 groups on the basis of color change around the colonies: streptococcus agalactiae, str dysgalactiae, and group g streptococci produced red zones; str uberis, str bovis, and enterococci produced yellow zones. pathogenic streptococci (str agalactiae, str dysgalactiae, str uberis, and group g streptococci) were obtained from quarters with scc significantly higher (p less than 0.01) than those of uninfected quarters. streptococcus bovis and enterococci were obtained from quarters with scc similar  to those of uninfected quarters and were considered nonpathogenic. pathogenic streptococci were found in much higher concentration than nonpathogenic streptococci and could be differentiated on that basis.
