TI  == mlpa diagnostics of complex microbial communities: relative quantification of bacterial species in oral biofilms.
AB  == a multitude of molecular methods are currently used for identification and characterization of oral biofilms or for community profiling. however, multiplex  pcr techniques that are able to routinely identify several species in a single assay are not available. multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (mlpa)  identifies up to 45 unique fragments in a single tube pcr. here we report a novel use of mlpa in the relative quantification of targeted microorganisms in a community of oral microbiota. we designed 9 species specific probes for: actinomyces gerencseriae, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces odontolyticus, candida albicans, lactobacillus acidophilus, rothia dentocariosa, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis and veillonella parvula; and genus specific probes for selected oral streptococci and lactobacilli based on their 16s rdna sequences. mlpa analysis of dna pooled from the strains showed the expected specific mlpa products. relative quantification of a serial dilution of equimolar dna showed that as little as 10 pg templates can be detected with clearly discernible signals. moreover, a 2 to 7% divergence in relative signal ratio of amplified probes observed from normalized peak area values suggests mlpa can be a cheaper alternative to using qpcr for quantification. we observed 2 to 6 fold fluctuations in signal intensities of mlpa products in dnas isolated from multispecies biofilms grown in various media for various culture times. furthermore, mlpa analyses of dna isolated from saliva obtained from different donors gave a varying number and intensity of signals. this clearly shows the usefulness of mlpa in a quantitative description of microbial shifts.

TI  == caries-related plaque microcosm biofilms developed in microplates.
AB  == in vivo dental plaque biofilms consist of complex communities of oral bacteria that are a challenge to replicate in vitro. the aim of this investigation was to  establish human dental plaque microcosms in microplates to reflect conditions that are relevant to dental caries. microcosm plaque biofilms were initiated from the saliva of two different donors, grown for up to 10 days in 24-welled microplates on thermanox coverslips in various types of artificial saliva with and without sucrose, which were replaced daily. microbiota composition of 40 species associated with oral health and dental caries was monitored in the plaques using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization analysis. ph was measured as an  indicator of cariogenic potential. the composition of the saliva inocula was different, and yielded plaque microcosms with different composition and growth responses to sucrose. artificial saliva type and presence of sucrose, and the resulting growth and ph conditions, modified the growth of individual species and hence the ecological profile of the microplate plaques during development. complex population shifts were observed during development, and older plaques comprised predominantly facultative anaerobic species. sucrose supplementation limited the decline of streptococci over time but did not increase the abundance  of mutans streptococci. sucrose at 0.15% increased levels of caries-associated species including lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus and actinomyces gerensceriae; these were further increased with sucrose at 0.5%, in addition to actinomyces israelii, rothia dentocariosa and capnocytophaga gingivalis. the microplate plaques demonstrated complex community dynamics that appeared to reflect the maturation of natural plaques, and sucrose induced a cariogenic plaque composition and ph.
