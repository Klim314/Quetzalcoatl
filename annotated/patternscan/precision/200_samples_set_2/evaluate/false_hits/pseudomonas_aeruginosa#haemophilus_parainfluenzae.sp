TI  == comparative in vitro potency of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and four oral agents  against recent north american clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29  species isolated in the us and canada between 1997 and 1999. based upon minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. against enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general,  displayed weak activity with only proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of gram-negative non-enterobacteriaceae including haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against burkholderia cepacia, pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.

TI  == in vitro activities of pd 117,596 and reference antibiotics against 448 clinical  bacterial strains.
AB  == the in vitro activity of pd 117,596, a new fluoroquinolone antibiotic, was tested against 448 bacterial isolates (15 genera) by agar dilution (inoculum, 10(4) cfu  per spot). the activity of pd 117,596 was compared with that of 15 antibiotics against 327 gram-negative strains and with that of 8 other antibiotics against 121 gram-positive strains. pd 117,596 demonstrated the best activity against klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., acinetobacter spp., serratia marcescens, and  branhamella catarrhalis (mics for 90% of the isolates [mic90s], 0.008 to 0.25 microgram/ml). pd 117,596 (mic90, 0.25 microgram/ml) was at least twofold more active than ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas spp. pd  117,596 and ciprofloxacin were similar in activity against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, legionella pneumophila, and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 0.002 to 0.125 microgram/ml). pd 117,596 was more active than ciprofloxacin against streptococcal groups a, b, c, and g, s. pneumoniae, and enterococci (mic90s, 0.06 to 0.125 microgram/ml). against staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant isolates, pd 117,596 (mic90s, 0.03 to 0.06 microgram/ml) was 4- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and was most active against corynebacterium spp. pd 117,596 appears to be the most active fluoroquinolone to  date, with excellent activity against gram-positive bacteria and enhanced activity against gram-negative aerobic-facultative bacteria.
