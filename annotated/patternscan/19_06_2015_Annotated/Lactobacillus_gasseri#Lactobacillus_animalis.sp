TI  == in vitro evaluation of probiotic properties of lactic acid bacteria from the gut  of labeo rohita and catla catla.
AB  == we report the evaluation of probiotic properties of potent lactic acid bacteria (lab) from the gut of freshwater fishes, labeo rohita and catla catla, for eventually developing probiotic strains for the prevention of bacterial infections in aquaculture and food preservation. five different lab strains were  isolated and characterized for their probiotic properties. based on physiological, morphological and biochemical characteristics, three isolates from labeo rohita and two from catla catla were identified as putative probiotics and  were denoted as lr11, lr14 and lr16 and cc3 and cc4, respectively. isolates cc3 and cc4 were acid (ph 2.5) and bile salt (0.3 % oxygall) tolerant and exhibited strong antibacterial activities against all pathogens including aeromonas hydrophila. in addition, all lab isolates were susceptible to tested antibiotics, except cc3 and cc4 which were vancomycin resistant. furthermore, the isolates cc3 and cc4 showed significantly higher in vitro cell surface properties, i.e., hydrophobicity, auto- and co-aggregation. biochemical tests, pcr detection and 16s rrna sequence analysis established that lr11, lr14, lr16, cc3 and cc4 are enterococcus avium tsu11, enterococcus pseudoavium tsu14, enterococcus raffinosus tsu16, lactobacillus gasseri tsu3 and lactobacillus animalis tsu4, respectively.  studies revealed that, lactobacillus gasseri tsu3 and lactobacillus animalis tsu4 are ideal probiotic candidates for its use in aquaculture and require further exploratory in vivo evaluation and safety studies.

TI  == restoring specific lactobacilli levels decreases inflammation and muscle atrophy  markers in an acute leukemia mouse model.
AB  == the gut microbiota has recently been proposed as a novel component in the regulation of host homeostasis and immunity. we have assessed for the first time  the role of the gut microbiota in a mouse model of leukemia (transplantation of baf3 cells containing ectopic expression of bcr-abl), characterized at the final  stage by a loss of fat mass, muscle atrophy, anorexia and inflammation. the gut microbial 16s rdna analysis, using pcr-denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis  and quantitative pcr, reveals a dysbiosis and a selective modulation of lactobacillus spp. (decrease of l. reuteri and l. johnsonii/gasseri in favor of l. murinus/animalis) in the baf3 mice compared to the controls. the restoration of lactobacillus species by oral supplementation with l. reuteri 100-23 and l. gasseri 311476 reduced the expression of atrophy markers (atrogin-1, murf1, lc3,  cathepsin l) in the gastrocnemius and in the tibialis, a phenomenon correlated with a decrease of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin-4, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor,  quantified by multiplex immuno-assay). these positive effects are strain- and/or  species-specific since l. acidophilus ncfm supplementation does not impact on muscle atrophy markers and systemic inflammation. altogether, these results suggest that the gut microbiota could constitute a novel therapeutic target in the management of leukemia-associated inflammation and related disorders in the muscle.

TI  == predominant genera of fecal microbiota in children with atopic dermatitis are not altered by intake of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bi-07.
AB  == the effect of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium lactis bi-07 on the composition of the lactobacillus group, bifidobacterium and the total bacterial population in feces from young children with atopic dermatitis was investigated. the study included 50 children randomized to intake of one of the probiotic strain or placebo. microbial composition was characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, quantitative pcr and, in a subset of subjects, by pyrosequencing of the 16s rrna  gene. the core population of the lactobacillus group was identified as lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus oris, leuconostoc mesenteroides, while the bifidobacterial community included bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium catenulatum. the fecal numbers of l. acidophilus and b. lactis increased significantly after intervention, indicating survival of the ingested bacteria. the levels of bifidobacterium correlated positively (p=0.03), while the levels of the lactobacillus group negatively (p=0.01) with improvement of atopic eczema evaluated by the severity scoring of atopic dermatitis index. this correlation was observed across the whole study cohort and not attributed to the probiotic intake. the main conclusion of the study is that administration of l. acidophilus ncfm and b. lactis bi-07 does not affect the composition and diversity of the main bacterial populations in feces.

TI  == evaluation of the passage of lactobacillus gasseri k7 and bifidobacteria from the stomach to intestines using a single reactor model.
AB  == background: probiotic bacteria are thought to play an important role in the digestive system and therefore have to survive the passage from stomach to intestines. recently, a novel approach to simulate the passage from stomach to intestines in a single bioreactor was developed. the advantage of this automated  one reactor system was the ability to test the influence of acid, bile salts and  pancreatin.lactobacillus gasseri k7 is a strain isolated from infant faeces with  properties making the strain interesting for cheese production. in this study, a  single reactor system was used to evaluate the survival of l. gasseri k7 and selected bifidobacteria from our collection through the stomach-intestine passage. results: initial screening for acid resistance in acidified culture media showed a low tolerance of bifidobacterium dentium for this condition indicating low survival in the passage. similar results were achieved with b. longum subsp. infantis whereas b. animalis subsp. lactis had a high survival.these initial results were confirmed in the bioreactor model of the stomach-intestine passage. b. animalis subsp. lactis had the highest survival rate (10%) attaining approximately 5 x 106 cfu ml-1 compared to the other tested  bifidobacteria strains which were reduced by a factor of up to 106. lactobacillus gasseri k7 was less resistant than b. animalis subsp. lactis but survived at cell concentrations approximately 1000 times higher than other bifidobacteria. conclusion: in this study, we were able to show that l. gasseri k7 had a high survival rate in the stomach-intestine passage. by comparing the results with a previous study in piglets we could confirm the reliability of our simulation. of  the tested bifidobacteria strains, only b. animalis subsp. lactis showed acceptable survival for a successful passage in the simulation system.

TI  == bifidobacterium lactis dsm 10140: identification of the atp (atpbefhagdc) operon  and analysis of its genetic structure, characteristics, and phylogeny.
AB  == the atp operon is highly conserved among eubacteria, and it has been considered a molecular marker as an alternative to the 16s rrna gene. pcr primers were designed from the consensus sequences of the atpd gene to amplify partial atpd sequences from 12 bifidobacterium species and nine lactobacillus species. all pcr products were sequenced and aligned with other atpd sequences retrieved from public databases. genes encoding the subunits of the f(1)f(0)-atpase of bifidobacterium lactis dsm 10140 (atpbefhagdc) were cloned and sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequences of these subunits showed significant homology with the sequences of other organisms. we identified specific sequence signatures for  the genus bifidobacterium and for the closely related taxa bifidobacterium lactis and bifidobacterium animalis and lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus johnsonii, which could provide an alternative to current methods for identification of lactic acid bacterial species. northern blot analysis showed that there was a transcript at approximately 7.3 kb, which corresponded to the size of the atp operon, and a transcript at 4.5 kb, which corresponded to the atpc, atpd, atpg, and atpa genes. the transcription initiation sites of these two mrnas were mapped by primer extension, and the results revealed no consensus promoter sequences. phylogenetic analysis of the atpd genes demonstrated that the lactobacillus atpd gene clustered with the genera listeria, lactococcus, streptococcus, and enterococcus and that the higher g+c content and highly biased codon usage with respect to the genome average support the hypothesis that there  was probably horizontal gene transfer. the acid inducibility of the atp operon of b. lactis dsm 10140 was verified by slot blot hybridization by using rna isolated from acid-treated cultures of b. lactis dsm 10140. the rapid increase in the level of atp operon transcripts upon exposure to low ph suggested that the atpase complex of b. lactis dsm 10140 was regulated at the level of transcription and not at the enzyme assembly step.

TI  == taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and enterococcus. the physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. in total, 176 strains, including  the type strains, have been included. phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic  proteins. genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and dna-dna hybridization for bifidobacteria. in the genus lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: l. acidophilus group, l. casei group and l. reuteri/l. fermentum group. most strains referred to as l. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as l. gasseri or as l. johnsonii, both members of the l. acidophilus group. a similar situation could be shown in the l. casei group, where most of the strains named l. casei belonged to l. paracasei subspp. a recent proposal to reject the species l. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species l. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. according to phenotypic features and confirmed by dna-dna hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to b. animalis, although they were often declared as b. longum by the manufacturer. from the genus enterococcus, probiotic ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the  vana-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. these unwanted resistances could  be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kda resistance protein. in conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood  by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.
