TI  == phytase modulates ileal microbiota and enhances growth performance of the broiler chickens.
AB  == phytase is well studied and explored, however, little is known about its effects  on the microbial ecology of the gastrointestinal tract. in total, 400 one-day-old female ross 308 chicks were randomly distributed to four experimental groups. the dietary treatments were arranged as a 2 x 2 complete factorial design, with the factors being adequate (pc) or insufficient calcium (ca) and digestible phosphor  (dp)(nc) and with or without 5000 phytase units (ftu)/kg of escherichia coli 6-phytase. the gastrointestinal tract ph values, ileal microbial communities and  short-chain fatty acid concentrations in the digesta were determined. the reduction in ca and dp concentration significantly affected ph in the crop and caeca, and addition of phytase to the nc resulted in a ph increase in the ileum.  the reduction in ca and dp concentration significantly lowered, while phytase supplementation increased ileal total bacterial counts. additionally, the deficient diet reduced butyrate- but increased lactate-producing bacteria. the addition of phytase increased lactobacillus sp./enterococcus sp. whereas in case  of clostridium leptum subgroup, clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale cluster, bifidobacterium sp. and streptococcus/lactococcus counts, a significant  ca and dp level x phytase interaction was found. however, the recorded interactions indicated that the effects of phytase and ca and dp levels were not  consistent. furthermore, the reduction of ca and dp level lowered clostridium perfringens and enterobacteriaceae counts. the analysis of fermentation products  showed that reducing the ca and dp content in the diet reduced total scfa, dl-lactate, and acetic acid in the ileum whereas phytase increased concentrations of these acids in the nc group. this suggests that p is a factor which limits fermentation in the ileum. it may be concluded that phytase plays a role in modulating the gut microbiota of chicken, however, this is clearly linked with the levels of p and ca in a diet.

TI  == longitudinal analyses of gut mucosal microbiotas in ulcerative colitis in relation to patient age and disease severity and duration.
AB  == bacteria belonging to the normal colonic microbiota are associated with the etiology of ulcerative colitis (uc). although several mucosal species have been implicated in the disease process, the organisms and mechanisms involved are unknown. the aim of this investigation was to characterize mucosal biofilm communities over time and to determine the relationship of these bacteria to patient age and disease severity and duration. multiple rectal biopsy specimens were taken from 33 patients with active uc over a period of 1 year. real-time pcr was used to quantify mucosal bacteria in uc patients compared to 18 noninflammatory bowel disease controls, and the relationship between indicators of disease severity and bacterial colonization was evaluated by linear regression analysis. significant differences were detected in bacterial populations on the uc mucosa and in the control group, which varied over the study period. high clinical activity indices (cai) and sigmoidoscopy scores (ss) were associated with enterobacteria, desulfovibrios, type e clostridium perfringens, and enterococcus faecalis, whereas the reverse was true for clostridium butyricum, ruminococcus albus, and eubacterium rectale. lactobacillus and bifidobacterium numbers were linked with low cai. only e. rectale and clostridium clostridioforme had a high age dependence. these findings demonstrated that longitudinal variations in mucosal bacterial populations occur in uc and that bacterial community structure is related to disease severity.

TI  == the effect of selected synbiotics on microbial composition and short-chain fatty  acid production in a model system of the human colon.
AB  == background: prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics can be used to modulate both the composition and activity of the gut microbiota and thereby potentially affecting host health beneficially. the aim of this study was to investigate the  effects of eight synbiotic combinations on the composition and activity of human  fecal microbiota using a four-stage semicontinuous model system of the human colon. methods and findings: carbohydrates were selected by their ability to enhance growth of the probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm (ncfm) and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bl-04 (bl-04) under laboratory conditions. the most effective carbohydrates for each probiotic were further investigated, using the colonic model, for the ability to support growth of the probiotic bacteria, influence the composition of the microbiota and stimulate formation of short-chain fatty acids (scfa).the following combinations were studied: ncfm with isomaltulose, cellobiose, raffinose and an oat beta-glucan hydrolysate (obgh) and bl-04 with melibiose, xylobiose, raffinose and maltotriose. all carbohydrates showed capable of increasing levels of ncfm and bl-04 during fermentations in the colonic model by 10(3)-10(4) fold and 10-10(2)  fold, respectively. also the synbiotic combinations decreased the modified ratio  of bacteroidetes/firmicutes (calculated using qpcr results for bacteroides-prevotella-porphyromonas group, clostridium perfringens cluster i, clostridium coccoides - eubacterium rectale group and clostridial cluster xiv) as well as significantly increasing scfa levels, especially acetic and butyric acid, by three to eight fold, as compared to the controls. the decreases in the modified ratio of bacteroidetes/firmicutes were found to be correlated to increases in acetic and butyric acid (p=0.04 and p=0.03, respectively). conclusions: the results of this study show that all synbiotic combinations investigated are able to shift the predominant bacteria and the production of scfa of fecal microbiota in a model system of the human colon, thereby potentially being able to manipulate the microbiota in a way connected to human health.

TI  == effects of age and region on fecal microflora in elderly subjects living in bama, guangxi, china.
AB  == intestinal microflora analysis was performed on 52 healthy elderly subjects of different ages and in different regions in bama county, guangxi, china. the participants were assigned to three groups depending on their age and location: longevous (group m; mean age = 98 years; n = 21); rural younger elderly (group s; mean age = 70 years; n = 18); and urban elderly (group c; mean age = 82 years; n  = 13). ten groups of bacteria were quantified using real-time pcr. age-related differences were observed in the number of clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale--there were more in longevous participants. region affected the numbers of bacteroides--prevotella and clostridium perfringens subgroup, and longevous participants had significantly more of the two bacterial groups than urban elderly participants. region-related effects were also observed for the relative  abundance of e. coli, and rural elderly participants had a lower proportion. both age and regional effects were observed in the amount of total bacteria, and longevous participants had higher numbers than urban elderly participants. a significantly higher proportion of lactobacilli was observed in rural younger elderly participants than urban elderly participants, but independent age or regional effects did not contribute to this difference. this study suggests that  age and region can affect the intestinal microflora of elderly people.

TI  == prebiotic effect of fruit and vegetable shots containing jerusalem artichoke inulin: a human intervention study.
AB  == the present study aimed to determine the prebiotic effect of fruit and vegetable  shots containing inulin derived from jerusalem artichoke (ja). a three-arm parallel, placebo-controlled, double-blind study was carried out with sixty-six healthy human volunteers (thirty-three men and thirty-three women, age range: 18-50 years). subjects were randomised into three groups (n 22) assigned to consume either the test shots, pear-carrot-sea buckthorn (pcs) or plum-pear-beetroot (ppb), containing ja inulin (5 g/d) or the placebo. fluorescent in situ hybridisation was used to monitor populations of total bacteria, bacteroides, bifidobacteria, clostridium perfringens/histolyticum subgroup, eubacterium rectale/clostridium coccoides group, lactobacillus/enterococcus spp., atopobium spp., faecalibacterium prausnitzii and propionibacteria. bifidobacteria levels were significantly higher on consumption  of both the pcs and ppb shots (10.0 (sd 0.24) and 9.8 (sd 0.22) log10 cells/g faeces, respectively) compared with placebo (9.3 (sd 0.42) log10 cells/g faeces)  (p < 0.0001). a small though significant increase in lactobacillus/enterococcus group was also observed for both the pcs and ppb shots (8.3 (sd 0.49) and 8.3 (sd 0.36) log10 cells/g faeces, respectively) compared with placebo (8.1 (sd 0.37) log10 cells/g faeces) (p = 0.042). other bacterial groups and faecal scfa concentrations remained unaffected. no extremities were seen in the adverse events, medication or bowel habits. a slight significant increase in flatulence was reported in the subjects consuming the pcs and ppb shots compared with placebo, but overall flatulence levels remained mild. a very high level of compliance (>90 %) to the product was observed. the present study confirms the prebiotic efficacy of fruit and vegetable shots containing ja inulin.

TI  == quantitative analysis of the intestinal bacterial community in one- to three-week-old commercially reared broiler chickens fed conventional or antibiotic-free vegetable-based diets.
AB  == aims: to explore the effect of drug-free poultry production on the intestinal microflora of broiler chickens, the bacterial community of this environment was quantitatively profiled in both conventionally reared birds and birds reared without antibiotic growth promotants (agps) on a vegetable-based diet. methods and results: quantitative, real-time pcr with group-specific 16s rdna primer sets was used to enumerate the abundance of the following chicken gastrointestinal (gi) tract phylogenetic groups: the clostridium leptum-faecalibacterium prausnitzii subgroup (clostridium genus cluster iv), the clostridium coccoides -  eubacterium rectale subgroup (clostridium cluster xiva and xivb), the bacteroides group (including prevotella and porphyromonas), bifidobacterium spp., the enterobacteriaceae, the lactobacillus group (including the genera leuconostoc, pediococcus, aerococcus and weissella), the clostridium perfringens subgroup (clostridium cluster i), enterococcus spp., veillonella spp., atopobium spp., campylobacter spp. and the domain bacteria. a species-specific 5'-nuclease (taqman) assay was also employed to specifically assess cl. perfringens abundance. ten birds were sampled from each of two commercial chicken houses, one in which feed was supplemented with agps and exogenous animal protein, and the other vegetable-based and drug-free, at 7, 14 and 21 days of age. the ileal community was dominated by two large populations, the lactobacilli and the enterobacteriaceae, with those taxa much more numerous in drug-free vegetable-based diet fed birds than those conventionally reared at the 7- and 14-day time periods. the progressive changes in microflora in both the conventional and drug-free caeca were similar to each other, with the enterobacteriaceae sequences dominating at day 7, but being replaced by obligate  anaerobe signature sequences by day 14. of note was the finding that all the day  14 and day 21 replicate caecal samples from the drug-free house were positive for campylobacter spp. averaging >10(8) 16s rdna gene copies per gram wet weight. conclusions: quantitative, real-time pcr indicates that the effects of drug-free  rearing on the chicken gi tract microbial community are most pronounced in the ileal region, but agps may be important in controlling campylobacter colonization of the caecum. significance and impact of the study: a quantitative taxonomic understanding of the shifting microbial ecology of the broiler chicken gut microbiota is important in the light of agp withdrawal. agp withdrawal has occurred in response to concerns over the transfer of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria to humans via the food production chain.

TI  == [efficacy of tinidazole against anaerobes in comparison with metronidazole, ornidazole, cefoxitin and lamoxactam].
AB  == the in vitro inhibitory activity of tinidazole, metronidazole, ornidazole, cefoxitin and moxalactam was determined against 150 isolates of clinically important anaerobes including bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides bivius and clostridium perfringens by means of agar dilution tests. the members of 18 gramnegative and 14 grampositive species were inhibited by tinidazole at less than or equal to 0,01-8 micrograms/ml thus being without exception susceptible to the drug. a similar in vitro activity was recorded for metronidazole and ornidazole. though cefoxitin and moxalactam generally had a good in vitro activity against most anaerobic species, single strains of bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. distasonis, clostridium difficile and eubacterium rectale were resistant to these drugs. with regard to its in vitro activity, tinidazole seems to be a promising substance for the therapy of anaerobic infections.
