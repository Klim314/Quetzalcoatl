TI  == molecular signatures (conserved indels) in protein sequences that are specific for the order pasteurellales and distinguish two of its main clades.
AB  == the members of the order pasteurellales are currently distinguished primarily on  the basis of their branching in the rrna trees and no convincing biochemical or molecular markers are known that distinguish them from all other bacteria. the genome sequences for 20 pasteurellaceae species/strains are now publicly available. we report here detailed analyses of protein sequences from these genomes to identify conserved signature indels (csis) that are specific for either all pasteurellales or its major clades. we describe more than 23 csis in widely distributed genes/proteins that are uniquely shared by all sequenced pasteurellaceae species/strains but are not found in any other bacteria. twenty-one additional csis are also specific for the pasteurellales except in some of these cases homologues were not detected in a few species or the csi was  also present in an isolated non-pasteurellaceae species. the sequenced pasteurellaceae species formed two distinct clades in a phylogenetic tree based upon concatenated sequences for 10 conserved proteins. the first of these clades  consisting of aggregatibacter, pasteurella, actinobacillus succinogenes, mannheimia succiniciproducens, haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus somnus was  also independently supported by 13 uniquely shared csis that are not present in other pasteurellaceae species or other bacteria. another clade consisting of the  remaining pasteurellaceae species (viz. actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, actinobacillus minor, haemophilus ducryi, mannheimia haemolytica and haemophilus  parasuis) was also strongly and independently supported by nine csis that are uniquely present in these bacteria. the order pasteurellales is presently made up of a single family, pasteurellaceae, that encompasses all of its genera. in this  context, our identification of two distinct clades within the pasteurellales, which are supported by both phylogenetic analyses and by multiple highly specific molecular markers, strongly argues for and provides potential means for the division of various genera from this order into a minimum of two families. the genetic changes responsible for these csis were likely introduced in the common ancestors of either all pasteurellales or of these two specific clades. these csis provide novel means for the identification and circumscription of these groups of pasteurellales in molecular terms.

TI  == sequence analysis of serotype-specific synthesis regions ii of haemophilus influenzae serotypes c and d: evidence for common ancestry of capsule synthesis in pasteurellaceae and neisseria meningitidis.
AB  == sequencing of yet unknown haemophilus influenzae serotype c (hic) and d (hid) capsule synthesis regions ii revealed four (ccs1-4) and five (dcs1-5) open reading frames, respectively. the inferred gene functions were in line with capsular polysaccharide structures. one or more proteins encoded by the hic capsule synthesis region ii showed similarity to actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae  serotype 1 and actinobacillus suis k1 enzymes. orthologues to the complete operon were observed in actinobacillus minor strain 202, where even the gene order was conserved. furthermore, ccs4 was related to the capsule o-acetyltransferase of neisseria meningitidis serogroup w-135. for the hid locus, similarities to hie, mannheimia haemolytica a1 and n. meningitidis serogroup a were identified and the succession of genes was similar in the different species. the resemblance of genes and gene organization found for hic and hid with other species suggested horizontal gene transfer during capsule evolution across the bacterial classes.

TI  == outer membrane-like vesicles secreted by actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans are enriched in leukotoxin.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is associated with early onset periodontal diseases and secretes membranous vesicles that appear to contain several virulence-associated proteins. however, the composition of these vesicles and the process leading to their secretion are not well defined. electron micrographs of  thin sectioned bacterial cells and purified vesicle preparations showed that vesicles are spherical lipid bilayers, 50-100 nm in diameter, that appear to form by budding from the outer membrane of the bacterium. thin layer chromatography identified the predominant lipid components of vesicles as lipopolysaccharide, phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin, similar to the main lipid constituents  of the outer membrane. however, vesicles also contained minor lipids that were not detected in outer membrane samples. the major protein constituents of vesicles co-migrated with proteins in outer membrane extracts of a. actinomycetemcomitans, but the outer membrane preparations possessed polypeptides that were not detected in vesicles. three vesicle proteins were identified; the heat-modifiable ompa homologue of a. actinomycetemcomitans, a 28 kda lipoprotein  related to the major outer membrane lipoprotein of mannheimia haemolytica and leukotoxin. incubation of leukotoxin-sensitive human hl60 cells with vesicles from a. actinomycetemcomitans strains jp2 and 652 resulted in cell lysis, indicating that vesicle-associated leukotoxin is biologically active. vesicles from the highly leukotoxic strain jp2 were five- to 10-fold more toxic than vesicles from the minimally leukotoxic 652 strain. furthermore, the specific leukotoxic activity of jp2 vesicles was approximately four- to five-fold higher than isolated outer membrane preparations from jp2, suggesting that vesicles are  enriched in leukotoxin. together, these results suggest that the formation of a.  actinomycetemcomitans vesicles occurs by a process that results in the enrichment of leukotoxin.

TI  == evaluation of the rapid nh system for identification of haemophilus somnus, pasteurella multocida, pasteurella haemolytica, and actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae isolated from cattle and pigs with respiratory disease.
AB  == haemophilus somnus, pasteurella haemolytica, pasteurella multocida, and actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae from cattle and pigs with respiratory disease were used to evaluate the rapid nh system (innovative diagnostics, atlanta, ga.). minor modifications of the rapid nh system to include animal source and growth requirements would permit the identification of all isolates tested.
