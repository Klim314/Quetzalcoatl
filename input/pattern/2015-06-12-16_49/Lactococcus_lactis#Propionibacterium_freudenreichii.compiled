TI  - 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes for direct detection of Propionibacterium freudenreichii in presence of Lactococcus lactis with multicolour fluorescence in situ hybridization.
AB  - Multicolour fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has been applied to detect  Lactococcus lactis and Propionibacterium freudenreichii cells in mixed populations in medium and skimmed milk, using epifluorescent microscopy. The 16S rRNA-targeted 18-mer oligonucleotide probes, specific for P. freudenreichii were designed and evaluated. Based on multiple alignments of designed sequences, eight 16S rRNA probes were selected for in vitro studies. The permeabilization protocol was optimized for simultaneous hybridization of propionibacteria and lactococci cells. The probes GLO62 (62-80), PEU64 (64-82) and PFX311 (311-329) were found specific for P. freudenreichii in analysis in vitro. Lactococcus lactis cells were labelled with LactV5 (822-840), (S-S-L.lact-0821-a-A-18) probe. The following combinations of oligonucleotide probes: LactV5/GLO62 , LactV5/PEU64 and LactV5/PFX311 , enabled differentiation of Lc. lactis and P. freudenreichii cells in culture media and in skimmed milk. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Results showed that three newly designed 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes specific for Propionibacterium freudenreichii in combination with a probe specific for Lactococcus lactis can be used to differentiate lactic and propionic acid bacteria in mixed communities using multicolour fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), without applying permeabilization step. This is a first study on simultaneous detection of both bacterial species with FISH, which was found as rapid, useful and culture-independent tool for direct visualization of bacteria on single cell level. It might be applied in monitoring of mixed starter cultures in dairy industry.
TI  - Role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  - Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. Following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285((R)) and Lactobacillus casei LBC80R((R)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical MRSA isolates, we conducted a literature search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment of S. aureus infection. As summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of S. aureus and clinical isolates of MRSA in vitro. The most active strains were Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Propionibacterium freudenreichii, Propionibacterium acnes, Lactobacillus paracasei, L. acidophilus, L. casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactococcus lactis. Their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. L. acidophilus also inhibited S. aureus biofilm formation and lipase production. In vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. S. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in vitro to L. acidophilus, whilst in vivo Bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. On the other hand, L. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against S. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with S. aureus in mice. Very few clinical data were found on the interactions between probiotics and MRSA, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of MRSA colonisation with probiotic use.
TI  - Interaction of Campylobacter spp. and human probiotics in chicken intestinal mucus.
AB  - Campylobacter is the most common cause of bacterial food-borne diarrhoeal disease throughout the world. The principal risk of human contamination is handling and consumption of contaminated poultry meat. To colonize poultry, Campylobacter adheres to and persists in the mucus layer that covers the intestinal epithelium. Inhibiting adhesion to the mucus could prevent colonization of the intestine. The aim of this study was to investigate in vitro the protective effect of defined commercial human probiotic strains on the adhesion of Campylobacter spp. to chicken intestinal mucus, in a search for alternatives to antibiotics to control this food-borne pathogen. The probiotic strains Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii JS and a starter culture strain Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis adhered well to chicken intestinal mucus and were able to reduce the binding of Campylobacter spp. when the mucus was colonized with the probiotic strain before contacting the pathogen. Human-intended probiotics could be useful as prophylactics in poultry feeding for controlling Campylobacter spp. colonization.
TI  - Engineering trehalose synthesis in Lactococcus lactis for improved stress tolerance.
AB  - Trehalose accumulation is a common cell defense strategy against a variety of stressful conditions. In particular, our team detected high levels of trehalose in Propionibacterium freudenreichii in response to acid stress, a result that led to the idea that endowing Lactococcus lactis with the capacity to synthesize trehalose could improve the acid tolerance of this organism. To this end, we took advantage of the endogenous genes involved in the trehalose catabolic pathway of L. lactis, i.e., trePP and pgmB, encoding trehalose 6-phosphate phosphorylase and beta-phosphoglucomutase, respectively, which enabled the synthesis of trehalose 6-phosphate. Given that L. lactis lacks trehalose 6-phosphate phosphatase, the respective gene, otsB, from the food-grade organism P. freudenreichii was used to provide the required activity. The trehalose yield was approximately 15% in resting cells and in mid-exponential-phase cells grown without pH control. The intracellular concentration of trehalose reached maximal values of approximately 170 mM, but at least 67% of the trehalose produced was found in the growth medium. The viability of mutant and control strains was examined after exposure to heat, cold or acid shock, and freeze-drying. The trehalose-producing strains showed improved tolerance (5- to 10-fold-higher survivability) to acid (pH 3) and cold shock (4 degrees C); there was also a strong improvement in cell survival in response to heat shock (45 degrees C), and no protection was rendered against dehydration. The insight provided by this work may help the design of food-grade strains optimized for the dairy industry as well as for oral drug delivery.
TI  - Correlation of the capsular phenotype in Propionibacterium freudenreichii with the level of expression of gtf, a unique polysaccharide synthase-encoding gene.
AB  - Many food-grade bacteria produce exopolysaccharides (EPS) that affect the texture of fermented food products and that may be involved in probiotic properties. Propionibacterium freudenreichii is a Gram-positive food-grade bacterium with reported probiotic capabilities that is widely used as starter in Swiss-type cheese. In this study, 68 strains of P. freudenreichii were screened for the beta-glucan capsular phenotype by immunoagglutination with a specific antibody and for the presence of the gtf gene coding for polysaccharide synthase. All strains were positive for PCR amplification with gtf gene-specific primers, but the presence of beta-glucan capsular EPS was detected for only 35% of the strains studied. Disruption of gtf in P. freudenreichii revealed that gtf is a unique gene involved in beta-glucan capsular EPS production in P. freudenreichii. The gtf gene was transferred into and expressed in Lactococcus lactis, in which it conferred an agglutination-positive phenotype. Expression of the gtf gene was measured by performing quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assays with RNA from four capsular and three noncapsular strains. A positive correlation was found between the beta-glucan capsular phenotype and gtf gene expression. Sequencing of the region upstream of the gtf open reading frame revealed the presence of an insertion element (IS element) in this upstream region in the four strains with the beta-glucan capsular phenotype. The role of the IS element in the expression of neighboring genes and its impact on interstrain variability of the P. freudenreichii capsule phenotype remain to be elucidated.
TI  - Use of DNA quantification to measure growth and autolysis of Lactococcus and Propionibacterium spp. in mixed populations.
AB  - Autolysis is self-degradation of the bacterial cell wall that results in the release of enzymes and DNA. Autolysis of starter bacteria, such as lactococci and propionibacteria, is essential for cheese ripening, but our understanding of this important process is limited. This is mainly because the current tools for measuring autolysis cannot readily be used for analysis of bacteria in mixed populations. We have now addressed this problem by species-specific detection and quantification of free DNA released during autolysis. This was done by use of 16S rRNA gene single-nucleotide extension probes in combination with competitive PCR. We analyzed pure and mixed populations of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and three different species of Propionibacterium. Results showed that L. lactis subsp. lactis INF L2 autolyzed first, followed by Propionibacterium acidipropionici ATCC 4965, Propionibacterium freudenreichii ISU P59, and then Propionibacterium jensenii INF P303. We also investigated the autolytic effect of rennet (commonly used in cheese production). We found that the effect was highly strain specific, with all the strains responding differently. Finally, autolysis of L. lactis subsp. lactis INF L2 and P. freudenreichii ISU P59 was analyzed in a liquid cheese model. Autolysis was detected later in this cheese model system than in broth media. A challenge with DNA, however, is DNA degradation. We addressed this challenge by using a DNA degradation marker. We obtained a good correlation between the degradation of the marker and the target in a model experiment. We conclude that our DNA approach will be a valuable tool for use in future analyses and for understanding autolysis in mixed bacterial populations.
TI  - Staphylococcus aureus adheres to human intestinal mucus but can be displaced by certain lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - There is increasing evidence that Staphylococcus aureus may colonize the intestinal tract, especially among hospitalized patients. As Staph. aureus has been found to be associated with certain gastrointestinal diseases, it has become important to study whether this bacterium can colonize the intestinal tract and if so, whether it is possible to prevent colonization. Adhesion is the first step in colonization; this study shows that Staph. aureus adheres to mucus from resected human intestinal tissue. Certain lactic acid bacteria (LAB), mainly commercial probiotics, were able to reduce adhesion and viability of adherent Staph. aureus. In displacement assays the amount of adherent Staph. aureus in human intestinal mucus was reduced 39-44% by Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii. Moreover, adherent Lactobacillus reuteri, Lc. lactis and P. freudenreichii reduced viability of adherent Staph. aureus by 27-36%, depending on the strain, after 2 h incubation. This was probably due to the production of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide and possibly in the case of L. reuteri to the production of reuterin. This study shows for the first time that Staph. aureus can adhere to human intestinal mucus and adherent bacteria can be displaced and killed by certain LAB strains via in situ production of antimicrobial substances.
TI  - Total bacterial and species-specific 16S rDNA micro-array quantification of complex samples.
AB  - AIMS: We describe a novel DNA-micro-array-based method that targets 16S rDNA to quantify changes in both the total bacterial DNA and the species-specific DNA composition. METHODS AND RESULTS: Quantifications were achieved by combining competitive PCR for quantifying total bacterial DNA with quantification of species-specific DNA composition based on signature 16S rDNA sequences. We constructed 11 different probes, which were evaluated on 21 different strains, in addition to complex samples. The signals obtained with sequence-specific labelling of the probes corresponded well with what should be expected based on 16S rDNA phylogenetic reconstruction. The quantification of species-specific DNA composition showed that the micro-array approach could be used to accurately determine differential growth of bacteria in mixed samples. We analysed samples containing mixtures of Lactococcus lactis and different species of propionibacteria during a 2-week incubation period. Lactococcus lactis grew fast, reaching a maximum after 12 h, Propionibacterium acidipropionici and Propionibacterium freudenreichii reached a maximum after 48 h, whereas Propionibacterium jensenii showed a slow increase during the whole growth period. The 16S rDNA total bacterial DNA quantification was compared with real-time PCR, absorbance measurements (ABS600) and colony forming units (CFU). CONCLUSION: The accuracy of the array approach was in the same range or better than the alternative techniques. The potential of the 16S rDNA micro-array method was further demonstrated using a liquid cheese model. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is to our knowledge the first time quantification of the total bacterial DNA and the species-specific DNA compositions of mixed populations have been achieved in the same assay.
TI  - Production of Propionibacterium shermanii biomass and vitamin B12 on spent media.
AB  - AIMS: The propionibacteria are commercially important due to their use in the cheese industry, and there is a growing interest for their probiotic effects. Stimulatory effects of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on propionic acid bacteria have been observed. This study was designed to examine the possibility of using spent media previously used to grow LAB for the production of biomass and metabolites of Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventeen MRS and vegetable juice media were prefermented by various LAB and evaluated for their ability to subsequently support the growth of Propionibacterium, using automated spectrophotometry (AS). Growth of Propionibacterium in spent media was strongly affected by the LAB strain used to produce the spent medium. The native MRS medium (not prefermented) yielded the highest optical density values followed by prefermented media by Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium longum and Lactococcus lactis. Prefermented cabbage juice enabled good growth of Propionibacterium. For the production of organic acids and vitamin B12, cells of Propionibacterium were concentrated and immobilized in alginate beads in the aim of accelerating the bioconversions. More propionic acid was obtained in spent media than in native MRS. The concentration of vitamin B12 was higher in media fermented with free cells than those with immobilized cultures; with the free cells, its concentration varied from 900 to 1800 ng ml(-1) of media. CONCLUSIONS: It was demonstrated that spent media could be recycled for the production of Propionibacterium and metabolites, depending on the LAB strain that was previously grown. Media remediation is needed to improve the production of vitamin B12, especially with immobilized cells. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study presents an option for recycling of spent media generated by producers of LAB or producers of fermented vegetables. The propionic fermentation may result in three commercial products: biomass, vitamin B12 or organic acids, which may be used as starters, supplements or food preservatives. It is an attractive process from economical and environmental standpoints.
TI  - Use of lactic and propionic acid bacteria in the production of fermented parsley  juice.
AB  - Taking into consideration the proliferation rate of Propionibacterium sp. cells,  pH changes and sensory properties of the fermented product obtained, selection of propionic acid bacteria (PAB) was made in order to determine their usefulness for the production of fermented parsley juice. The analysis included 12 strains, belonging to the following species: P. thoenii (4 strains), P. jensenii (6 strains), P. freudenreichii (1 strain) and P. acidipropionici (1 strain). The experiments show that many strains of propionic acid rods develop well in parsley juice, allowing to achieve the desired taste qualities of the product. The Propionibacterium strains selected by elimination were used as components of vaccine containing: Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
TI  - Efficient mechanical disruption of Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus lactis and Propionibacterium freudenreichii by a new high-pressure homogenizer and recovery of intracellular aminotransferase activity.
AB  - Microbiological studies often involve bacterial cell fractionation, which is known to be difficult for Gram-positive as compared to Gram-negative bacteria. Our purpose was to test the breaking efficiency of a new high-pressure pilot homogenizer for three Gram-positive species involved in dairy technology and to assess the activity of an intracellular aminotransferase. Varied pressures (50, 100 and 200 MPa) were applied to concentrated bacterial suspensions (1.2 mg dry weight/ml) of Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus lactis and Propionibacterium freudenreichii. Breaking efficiency was estimated by decreases in optical density at 650 nm, cellular dry weight and viability. The proteins released were quantified and the residual intracellular aminotransferase activity was estimated using leucine as substrate. One run at 50 MPa was sufficient to break 80% of lactobacilli cells whereas 200 MPa were required for the same efficiency for L. lactis and P. freudenreichii. Whatever the pressure, leucine aminotransferase activity was recovered in the supernatant after cell breaking. This new high-pressure pilot homogenizer can allow rapid (20 s/run), easy, continuous and highly efficient cell breaking for intracellular enzyme recovery or other purposes. As the species tested were not phylogenetically related, and had different morphologies and cell wall compositions, we conclude that most Gram-positive bacteria may be broken efficiently by this new device.
TI  - Humic acid reduction by propionibacterium freudenreichii and other fermenting bacteria
AB  - Iron-reducing bacteria have been reported to reduce humic acids and low-molecular-weight quinones with electrons from acetate or hydrogen oxidation. Due to the rapid chemical reaction of amorphous ferric iron with the reduced reaction products, humic acids and low-molecular-weight redox mediators may play an important role in biological iron reduction. Since many anaerobic bacteria that are not able to reduce amorphous ferric iron directly are known to transfer electrons to other external acceptors, such as ferricyanide, 2,6-anthraquinone disulfonate (AQDS), or molecular oxygen, we tested several physiologically different species of fermenting bacteria to determine their abilities to reduce humic acids. Propionibacterium freudenreichii, Lactococcus lactis, and Enterococcus cecorum all shifted their fermentation patterns towards more oxidized products when humic acids were present; P. freudenreichii even oxidized propionate to acetate under these conditions. When amorphous ferric iron was added to reoxidize the electron acceptor, humic acids were found to be equally effective when they were added in substoichiometric amounts. These findings indicate that in addition to iron-reducing bacteria, fermenting bacteria are also capable of channeling electrons from anaerobic oxidations via humic acids towards iron reduction. This information needs to be considered in future studies of electron flow in soils and sediments.
TI  - Jenseniin G, a heat-stable bacteriocin produced by Propionibacterium jensenii P126.
AB  - The genus Propionibacterium includes cutaneous species typically found on human skin and the dairy or classical species (Propionibacterium freudenreichii, P. jensenii, P. thoenii, and P. acidipropionici) used industrially for the production of Swiss cheese and propionic acid. Grinstead (1989, M.S. thesis, Iowa State University, Ames) has previously observed that some dairy propionibacteria inhibit other species in the classical grouping. We further investigated the inhibitor(s) produced by P. jensenii P126 (ATCC 4872). An antagonist(s) from anaerobic agar cultures of P126 strongly inhibited two closely related strains of propionibacteria, P. acidipropionici P5 and P. jensenii P54, and Lactobacillus bulgaricus NCDO 1489, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis ATCC 4797, Lactococcus cremoris NCDO 799, and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis C2. The inhibitor, designated jenseniin G, was active at pH 7.0; inactivated by treatment with pronase E, proteinase K, and type 14 protease; insensitive to catalase; and stable to freezing, cold storage (4 degrees C, 3 days), and heat (100 degrees C, 15 min). Classification of the inhibitor as a bacteriocin is supported by its proteinaceous nature and its bactericidal activity against L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis ATCC 4797. The lack of detectable plasmids suggests a chromosomal location for the determinant(s) of jenseniin G.
