TI  == a methodological approach to screen diverse cheese-related bacteria for their ability to produce aroma compounds.
AB  == microorganisms play an important role in the development of cheese flavor. the aim of this study was to develop an approach to facilitate screening of various cheese-related bacteria for their ability to produce aroma compounds. we combined i) curd-based slurry medium incubated under conditions mimicking cheese manufacturing and ripening, ii) powerful method of extraction of volatiles, headspace trap, coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (hs-trap-gc-ms),  and iii) metabolomics-based method of data processing using the xcms package of r software and multivariate analysis. this approach was applied to eleven species:  five lactic acid bacteria (leuconostoc lactis, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus helveticus), four actinobacteria (brachybacterium articum, brachybacterium tyrofermentans, brevibacterium aurantiacum, and microbacterium gubbeenense), propionibacterium freudenreichii, and hafnia alvei. all the strains grew, with maximal populations  ranging from 7.4 to 9.2 log (cfu/ml). in total, 52 volatile aroma compounds were  identified, of which 49 varied significantly in abundance between bacteria. principal component analysis of volatile profiles differentiated species by their ability to produce ethyl esters (associated with brachybacteria), sulfur compounds and branched-chain alcohols (h. alvei), branched-chain acids (h. alvei, p. freudenreichii and l. paracasei), diacetyl and related carbonyl compounds (m.  gubbeenense and l. paracasei), among others.
