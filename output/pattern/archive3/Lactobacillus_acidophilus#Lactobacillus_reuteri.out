divergent signaling pathways regulate il-12 production induced by different species of lactobacilli in human dendritic cells.
recent studies have indicated that different strains of lactobacilli differ in their ability to regulate il-12 production by dendritic cells (dcs), as some strains are stronger inducer of il-12 while other are not and can even inhibit il-12 production stimulated by il-12-inducer lactobacilli. in this report we demonstrate that lactobacillus reuteri 5289, as previously described for other strains of l. reuteri, can inhibit dc production of il-12 induced by lactobacilllus acidophilus ncfm. remarkably, l. reuteri 5289 was able to inhibit il-12 production induced not only by lactobacilli, as so far reported, but also by bacteria of different genera, including pathogens. we investigated in human dcs the signal transduction pathways involved in the inhibition of il-12 production induced by l. reuteri 5289, showing that this potential anti-inflammatory activity, which is also accompanied by an elevated il-10 production, is associated to a prolonged phosphorilation of erk1/2 map kinase pathway. improved understanding of the immune regulatory mechanisms exerted by lactobacilli is crucial for a more precise employment of these commensal bacteria as probiotics in human immune-mediated pathologies, such as allergies or inflammatory bowel diseases.
characterization of the effects of three lactobacillus species on the function of chicken macrophages.
lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus salivarius can influence the adaptive immune responses in chickens but vary in their ability to do so. the present study attempted to identify how these three bacteria alter the innate immune system. a chicken macrophage cell line, mq-ncsu, was co-cultured with the three live lactobacillus species, alone or in combination, grown at different temperatures for various durations of time. late exponential growth phase bacteria were more immunostimulatory, while bacterial growth temperature had little effect. l. acidophilus and l. salivarius significantly increased nitric oxide (no) production and phagocytosis, while l. reuteri did not. in fact, l reuteri was shown to inhibit no production of macrophages when co-cultured with the other bacteria or when cells were pre-treated with lps. the results demonstrate a possible molecular mechanism for the immunomodulatory effects of l. acidophilus and l. salivarius, and a unique immunomodulatory ability of l. reuteri.
anti-infective activities of lactobacillus strains in the human intestinal microbiota: from probiotics to gastrointestinal anti-infectious biotherapeutic agents.
a vast and diverse array of microbial species displaying great phylogenic, genomic, and metabolic diversity have colonized the gastrointestinal tract. resident microbes play a beneficial role by regulating the intestinal immune system, stimulating the maturation of host tissues, and playing a variety of roles in nutrition and in host resistance to gastric and enteric bacterial pathogens. the mechanisms by which the resident microbial species combat gastrointestinal pathogens are complex and include competitive metabolic interactions and the production of antimicrobial molecules. the human intestinal microbiota is a source from which lactobacillus probiotic strains have often been isolated. only six probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, i.e., l. rhamnosus gg, l. casei shirota yit9029, l. casei dn-114 001, l. johnsonii ncc 533, l. acidophilus lb, and l. reuteri dsm 17938, have been well characterized with regard to their potential antimicrobial effects against the major gastric and enteric bacterial pathogens and rotavirus. in this review, we describe the current knowledge concerning the experimental antibacterial activities, including antibiotic-like and cell-regulating activities, and therapeutic effects demonstrated in well-conducted, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of these probiotic lactobacillus strains. what is known about the antimicrobial activities supported by the molecules secreted by such probiotic lactobacillus strains suggests that they constitute a promising new source for the development of innovative anti-infectious agents that act luminally and intracellularly in the gastrointestinal tract.
antifungal activity of lactobacilli and its relationship with 3-phenyllactic acid production.
in this study, 13 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains (including 5 lactobacillus casei, 2 lactobacillus rhamnosus, 2 lactobacillus fermentum, 1 lactobacillus acidophilus, 1 lactobacillus plantarum, 1 lactobacillus sakei, and 1 lactobacillus reuteri species) were assessed for both their antifungal activity against four food spoilage molds (colletotrichum gloeosporioides, botrytis cinerea, penicillium expansum, and aspergillus flavus) and their capability to produce the novel antimicrobial compound 3-phenyllactic acid (pla). results demonstrated that all molds were sensitive to varying degrees to the cell-free supernatants (cfs) from lab fermentations (p<0.05), with growth inhibitions ranging from 2.65% to 66.82%. the inhibition ability of cfs was not affected by a heating treatment (121 degrees c, 20 min); however, it declined markedly when the ph of cfs was adjusted to 6.5. with the exception of l. plantarum nrrl b-4496 and l. acidophilus atcc-4495, all other lab strains produced pla ranging from 0.021 to 0.275 mm. the high minimum inhibitory concentration for commercial pla (3.01-36.10mm) suggests that it cannot be considered the only compound related with the antifungal potential of studied lab and that synergistic effects may exist among other metabolism products.
effect of probiotics on biomarkers of cardiovascular disease: implications for heart-healthy diets.
the objectives of this article are to review clinical trials that have examined the effects of probiotics on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c) and to assess the potential of probiotic intake as a therapeutic lifestyle change (tlc) dietary option. twenty-six clinical studies and two meta-analyses are reviewed. significant ldl-c reductions were observed for four probiotic strains: lactobacillus reuteri ncimb 30242, enterococcus faecium, and the combination of lactobacillus acidophilus la5 and bifidobacterium lactis bb12. two synbiotics, l. acidophilus cho-220 plus inulin and l. acidophilus plus fructo-oligosaccharides, also decreased ldl-c. of the probiotics examined, l. reuteri ncimb 30242 was found to best meet tlc dietary requirements by 1) significantly reducing ldl-c and total cholesterol, with robustness similar to that of existing tlc dietary options, 2) improving other coronary heart disease risk factors, such as inflammatory biomarkers, and 3) having "generally recognized as safe" (gras) status. based on these results, the probiotic l. reuteri ncimb 30242 is a viable candidate both for future tlc dietary studies and as a potential option for inclusion in tlc dietary recommendations.
role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.
antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272, lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b. longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.
lactobacillus reuteri crl 1098 and lactobacillus acidophilus crl 1014 differently reduce in vitro immunotoxic effect induced by ochratoxin a.
ochratoxin a (ota) is a widespread mycotoxin contaminating several food products  which causes detrimental health effects. the ability of lactobacillus reuteri crl 1098 and lactobacillus acidophilus crl 1014 to prevent ota effects on tnf-alpha and il-10 production and apoptosis induction in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) was investigated. membrane rafts participation in these responses was also evaluated. l. reuteri reduced by 29% the ota inhibition of tnf-alpha production whereas l. acidophilus increased 8 times the tnf-alpha production by ota treated-pbmc. also, both bacteria reversed apoptosis induced by ota by 32%. however, neither of the bacteria reversed the ota inhibition on il-10 production. on the other hand, the lactobacilli were less effective to reverse ota effects on disrupted-rafts pbmc. this study shows that two lactobacilli strains can reduce some negative ota effects, being membrane rafts integrity necessary to obtain better results. also, the results highlight the potential capacity of some lactobacilli strains usually included in natural dietary components in milk-derived products and cereals feed, to reduce ota toxicity once ingested by humans or animals.
restoring specific lactobacilli levels decreases inflammation and muscle atrophy  markers in an acute leukemia mouse model.
the gut microbiota has recently been proposed as a novel component in the regulation of host homeostasis and immunity. we have assessed for the first time the role of the gut microbiota in a mouse model of leukemia (transplantation of baf3 cells containing ectopic expression of bcr-abl), characterized at the final stage by a loss of fat mass, muscle atrophy, anorexia and inflammation. the gut microbial 16s rdna analysis, using pcr-denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitative pcr, reveals a dysbiosis and a selective modulation of lactobacillus spp. (decrease of l. reuteri and l. johnsonii/gasseri in favor of l. murinus/animalis) in the baf3 mice compared to the controls. the restoration of lactobacillus species by oral supplementation with l. reuteri 100-23 and l. gasseri 311476 reduced the expression of atrophy markers (atrogin-1, murf1, lc3, cathepsin l) in the gastrocnemius and in the tibialis, a phenomenon correlated with a decrease of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin-4, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, quantified by multiplex immuno-assay). these positive effects are strain- and/or species-specific since l. acidophilus ncfm supplementation does not impact on muscle atrophy markers and systemic inflammation. altogether, these results suggest that the gut microbiota could constitute a novel therapeutic target in the management of leukemia-associated inflammation and related disorders in the muscle.
growth inhibition of oral mutans streptococci and candida by commercial probiotic lactobacilli--an in vitro study.
background: probiotic bacteria are suggested to play a role in the maintenance of oral health. such health promoting bacteria are added to different commercial probiotic products. the aim of the study was to investigate the ability of a selection of lactobacilli strains, used in commercially available probiotic products, to inhibit growth of oral mutans streptococci and c. albicans in vitro. methods: eight probiotic lactobacilli strains were tested for growth inhibition on three reference strains and two clinical isolates of mutans streptococci as well as two reference strains and three clinical isolates of candida albicans with an agar overlay method. results: at concentrations ranging from 109 to 105 cfu/ml, all lactobacilli strains inhibited the growth of the mutans streptococci completely with the exception of l. acidophilus la5 that executed only a slight inhibition of some strains at concentrations corresponding to 107 and 105 cfu/ml. at the lowest cell concentration (103 cfu/ml), only l. plantarum 299v and l. plantarum 931 displayed a total growth inhibition while a slight inhibition was seen for all five mutans streptococci strains by l. rhamnosus lb21, l. paracasei f19, l. reuteri pta 5289 and l. reuteri atcc 55730. all the tested lactobacilli strains reduced candida growth but the effect was generally weaker than for mutans streptococci. the two l. plantarum strains and l. reuteri atcc 55730 displayed the strongest inhibition on candida albicans. no significant differences were observed between the reference strains and the clinical isolates. conclusion: the selected probiotic strains showed a significant but somewhat varying ability to inhibit growth of oral mutans streptococci and candida albicans in vitro.
identification of lactobacilli isolated from the cloaca and vagina of laying hens and characterization for potential use as probiotics to control salmonella enteritidis.
aims: to select lactobacillus strains from laying hens for potential use as probiotic to control salmonella enteritidis infection. methods and results: one hundred and eighty-six lactobacilli were isolated from the cloaca and vagina of laying hens, and identified at the species level by a polyphasic taxonomic approach. all isolates belonged to the lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri or lactobacillus salivarius phylogenetic groups, with the l. reuteri group being the most predominant group. based on genetic diversity, about 50 representative strains were selected and tested for in vitro properties that could be predictive for probiotic activity in laying hens. salmonella inhibition was shown to be species dependent, and correlated to some extent with the production of lactic acid. a selection of strains was evaluated in a s. enteritidis challenge experiment. two strains, l. reuteri r-17485 and lactobacillus johnsonii r-17504 significantly decreased the colonization of chicks by s. enteritidis in caeca, liver and spleen. conclusions: lactobacilli isolated from laying hens were observed to inhibit salmonella growth in vitro, most probably through production of lactic acid, and to decrease in vivo the s. enteritidis colonization of chicks. significance and impact of the study: the data demonstrate that lactobacillus isolates from laying hens may have probiotic potential in reducing s. enteritidis infection.
modulation of anti-pathogenic activity in canine-derived lactobacillus species by carbohydrate growth substrate.
aims: to investigate the effect of various carbon sources on the production of extracellular antagonistic compounds against two escherichia coli strains and salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium by three canine-derived lactobacilli strains. methods and materials: cell-free preparations, ph neutralized, were used in antibiotic disc experiments as an initial screening. the bacteria/carbohydrate combinations that showed inhibition of the growth of those pathogens, were further investigated in batch co-culture experiments. the cell-free supernatants of the cultures, that decreased the population number of the pathogens in the co-culture experiments to log cfu ml-1 <or= 4, were tested for inhibition of the pathogens in pure cultures at neutral and acidic ph. conclusions: the results showed that the substrate seems to affect the production of antimicrobial compounds and this effect could not just be ascribed to the ability of the bacteria to grow in the various carbon sources. l. mucosae, l. acidophilus and l. reuteri, when grown in sugar mixtures consisting of alpha-glucosides (degree of polymerization (dp) 1-4) could produce antimicrobial compounds active against all three pathogens in vitro. this effect could not be attributed to a single ingredient of those sugar mixtures and was synergistic. this inhibition had a dose-response characteristic and was more active at acidic ph. significance and impact of the study: knowledge of the effect that the carbon source has on the production of antimicrobial compounds by gut-associated lactobacilli allows the rational design of prebiotic/probiotic combinations to combat gastrointestinal pathogens.
molecular analysis of mutated lactobacillus acidophilus promoter-like sequence p15.
the promoter-like sequence p15 that was previously cloned from the chromosome of  lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 is active in lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, and escherichia coli, but not in lactococcus lactis. n-methyl-n-nitroso-n-guanidine (mnng) mutagenesis of p15 was used to select for a promoter active in l. lactis mg1363. molecular analysis of the mutated promoter (designated p16) revealed a 90 bp deletion and a t-->a transversion. this deletion, in combination with the addition to the transversion, created a promoter with putative -35 and -10 hexamers identical to the consensus promoter sequence found in e. coli and bacillus subtilis vegetative promoters. the activity of p16 was measured by its ability to promote chloramphenicol resistance in different bacteria when inserted in the promoter-probe plasmid pbv5030 (designated pla16). the mic of chloramphenicol in l. lactis, l. reuteri, l. plantarum, e. coli, and l. acidophilus harbouring pla16 were 30, 170, 180, > 500, and 3 micrograms/ml, respectively. this represents an increase in promoter activity compared to p15 in l. reuteri of 3-fold, in l. plantarum of 9-fold, and in e. coli of at least 2.5-fold, but a decrease in l. acidophilus of 7-fold.
antagonistic activity of bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus species from ogi,  an indigenous fermented food.
seven lactobacillus species each with one or more strains were isolated from various fermented cereal gruel's (ogi). they were identified as l. plantarum (3 strains), l. delbrueckii (1 strain), l. brevis (2 strains), l. reuteri (2 strains), l. casei (1 strain), l. fermentum (1 strain) and l. acidophilus (1 strain). bacteriocin production was observed in cell-free supernatants of 8 of these strains with l. fermentum, l. delbrueckii and l. reuteri strains (white maize ogi) being negative. the bacteriocin produced by the eight strains inhibited the growth of various target organisms with the inhibition strongly noticed using enterococcus faecalis as indicator. while catalase treatment, ph changes and heat treatment up to 80 degrees c had no effect on the activity of bacteriocin from these isolates, treatment with trypsin and proteinase k resulted in complete loss of inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins. a reduction in the inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins was also found to occur with increasing concentrations of glucose or peptone in the cultivation medium.
antibacterial activity of lactobacillus species against vibrio species.
forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.
