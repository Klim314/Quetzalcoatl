TI  == nationwide surveillance of 6 otorhinolaryngological infectious diseases and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in the isolated pathogens in japan.
AB  == the japanese three academic societies joint antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance committee has conducted a nationwide surveillance on antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and rates of isolation in 6 otolaryngological diseases. the surveillance program was conducted in the otorhinolaryngological departments  of 29 universities, and their 26 affiliated hospitals. patients suffering from acute otitis media, chronic otitis media, acute nasal sinusitis, chronic nasal sinusitis, acute tonsillitis, and peritonsillar abscess between january 2011 and  june 2012 were investigated. the collected swab or incision samples were cultivated for microbial identification, and the drug susceptibility of detected  bacteria was measured at the kitasato university research center for infections and antimicrobials. the surveillance focused on three gram-positive bacteria (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus), three gram-negative bacteria (haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and  pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three anaerobic bacteria (peptostreptococcus spp., prevotella spp., and fusobacterium spp.). bacterial susceptibility to 39 antimicrobial drugs was investigated. we compared bacterial isolation ratio of each disease in this surveillance from those of past 4 times surveillance which we performed formerly, and we also compared percentage of main drug resistant strains from those of past 4 times surveillance. the age composition between this time and former surveillances was not statistically significant by student-t test. we were unable to completely resolve the rise in resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant s. aureus, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase non-producing ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae, beta-lactamase producing ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae, and beta-lactamase producing amoxicillin clavulanic acid-resistant h. influenzae. we suggest promoting the proper usage of antimicrobial drugs in order to avoid the spread of these bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of preparation bioaron c.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of sirupus bioaron c, a preparation, whose main ingredient is an extract from the leaves of aloe arborescens, was tested against  different microorganisms isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infections. the experiments were performed on 40 strains: 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria, 13 strains of aerobic bacteria and 7 strains of yeast-like fungi from the genus candida and on 18 reference strains (atcc). the antimicrobial activity  of bioaron c (mbc and mfc) was determined at undiluted concentration. bioaron c proved to be very effective against the microorganisms causing infections. at the concentration recommended by the producer, the preparation showed biocidal activity (mbc, mfc) against the strains of the pathogenic microorganisms, which cause respiratory infections most frequently, including, among others, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, parvimonas micra, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus anginosus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans, already after 15 min. the mic of bioaron c against most of the tested microorganisms was 5 to 100 times lower than the usually applied concentration. the great antimicrobial activity means that the preparation may be used in the prevention and treatment of infections of the upper respiratory tract. bioaron c  may be an alternative or complement to classical therapy, especially in children.

TI  == microbiology of explanted suture segments from infected and noninfected surgical  patients.
AB  == sutures under selective host/environmental factors can potentiate postoperative surgical site infection (ssi). the present investigation characterized microbial  recovery and biofilm formation from explanted absorbable (ab) and nonabsorbable (nab) sutures from infected and noninfected sites. ab and nab sutures were harvested from noninfected (70.9%) and infected (29.1%) sites in 158 patients. at explantation, devices were sonicated and processed for qualitative/quantitative bacteriology; selective sutures were processed for scanning electron microscopy (sem). bacteria were recovered from 85 (53.8%) explanted sites; 39 sites were noninfected, and 46 were infected. suture recovery ranged from 11.1 to 574.6 days postinsertion. a significant difference in mean microbial recovery between noninfected (1.2 isolates) and infected (2.7 isolates) devices (p < 0.05) was noted. staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia spp. were recovered from infected devices, while commensal skin flora was recovered from noninfected  devices. no significant difference in quantitative microbial recovery between infected monofilament and multifilament sutures was noted. biofilm was present in 100% and 66.6% of infected and noninfected devices, respectively (p < 0.042). we  conclude that both monofilament and braided sutures provide a hospitable surface  for microbial adherence: (i) a significant difference in microbial recovery from  infected and noninfected sutures was noted, (ii) infected sutures harbored a mixed flora, including multidrug-resistant health care-associated pathogens, and  (iii) a significant difference in the presence or absence of a biofilm in infected versus noninfected explanted devices was noted. further studies to document the benefit of focused risk reduction strategies to minimize suture contamination and biofilm formation postimplantation are warranted.

TI  == assessment of microbial diversity in biofilms recovered from endotracheal tubes using culture dependent and independent approaches.
AB  == ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) is a common nosocomial infection in mechanically ventilated patients. biofilm formation is one of the mechanisms through which the endotracheal tube (et) facilitates bacterial contamination of the lower airways. in the present study, we analyzed the composition of the et biofilm flora by means of culture dependent and culture independent (16 s rrna gene clone libraries and pyrosequencing) approaches. overall, the microbial diversity was high and members of different phylogenetic lineages were detected (actinobacteria, beta-proteobacteria, candida spp., clostridia, epsilon-proteobacteria, firmicutes, fusobacteria and gamma-proteobacteria). culture dependent analysis, based on the use of selective growth media and conventional microbiological tests, resulted in the identification of typical aerobic nosocomial pathogens which are known to play a role in the development of vap, e.g. staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. other opportunistic pathogens were also identified, including staphylococcus epidermidis and kocuria  varians. in general, there was little correlation between the results obtained by sequencing 16 s rrna gene clone libraries and by cultivation. pyrosequencing of pcr amplified 16 s rrna genes of four selected samples resulted in the identification of a much wider variety of bacteria. the results from the pyrosequencing analysis suggest that these four samples were dominated by members of the normal oral flora such as prevotella spp., peptostreptococcus spp. and lactic acid bacteria. a combination of methods is recommended to obtain a complete picture of the microbial diversity of the et biofilm.

TI  == gingival fluid cytokine expression and subgingival bacterial counts during pregnancy and postpartum: a case series.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to assess gingival fluid (gcf) cytokine messenger rna (mrna) levels, subgingival bacteria, and clinical periodontal conditions during a normal pregnancy to postpartum. materials and methods: subgingival bacterial samples were analyzed with the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. gcf samples were assessed with real-time pcr including five proinflammatory cytokines and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor. results: nineteen pregnant women with a mean age of 32 years (s.d. +/- 4 years, range 26-42) participated in the study. full-mouth bleeding scores (bop) decreased from an average of 41.2% (s.d. +/- 18.6%) at the 12th week of pregnancy to 26.6% (s.d. +/- 14.4%) at the 4-6 weeks postpartum (p < 0.001). between week 12 and 4-6 weeks postpartum, the mean probing pocket depth changed from 2.4 mm (s.d. +/- 0.4) to 2.3 mm (s.d. +/- 0.3) (p = 0.34). higher counts of eubacterium saburreum, parvimonas micra, selenomonas noxia, and staphylococcus aureus were found at week 12 of pregnancy than at the 4-6 weeks postpartum examinations (p < 0.001). during and after pregnancy, statistically significant correlations between bop scores and bacterial counts were observed. bop scores and gcf levels of selected cytokines were not related to each other and no differences in gcf levels of the  cytokines were observed between samples from the 12th week of pregnancy to 4-6 weeks postpartum. decreasing postpartum counts of porphyromonas endodontalis and  pseudomonas aeruginosa were associated with decreasing levels of il-8 and il-1beta. conclusions: bop decreased after pregnancy without any active periodontal therapy. associations between bacterial counts and cytokine levels varied greatly in pregnant women with gingivitis and a normal pregnancy outcome.  postpartum associations between gcf cytokines and bacterial counts were more consistent. clinical relevance: combined assessments of gingival fluid cytokines  and subgingival bacteria may provide important information on host response.

TI  == primary sternal osteomyelitis due to peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  == primary sternal osteomyelitis (pso) is a rare syndrome. in adults, it usually occurs with underlying predisposing factors, such as immunodeficiency, or intravenous (iv) drug abuse. the infecting organism in these patients is usually  staphylococcus aureus or pseudomonas aeruginosa. peptostreptococcus species are gram-positive anaerobic cocci and are part of the normal flora of human mucocutaneous surfaces. peptostreptococcus infection can occur in all body sites, including the central nervous system, head, neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, skin, bone, joint, and soft tissue. here, we report on a 32-year-old previously healthy chinese man who was diagnosed with pso and p. anaerobius was yielded in the bacterial culture. he was treated empirically with antibiotics, but these failed. after additional limited surgical intervention with debridement, the pso was cured.

TI  == sitafloxacin: in bacterial infections.
AB  == sitafloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial with in vitro activity against a  broad range of gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including anaerobic bacteria, as well as against atypical pathogens. it is approved in japan for use  in a number of bacterial infections caused by sitafloxacin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococcus spp., enterococcus spp., moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus spp., morganella morganii, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, legionella pneumophila, peptostreptococcus spp., prevotella spp., porphyromonas spp., fusobacterium spp., chlamydia trachomatis, chlamydophila pneumoniae and mycoplasma pneumoniae. in terms of clinical efficacy, oral sitafloxacin was noninferior to oral levofloxacin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia or an infectious exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract disease, noninferior to oral tosufloxacin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, and noninferior to oral levofloxacin in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, according to the results of randomized, double-blind, multicentre, noninferiority trials. noncomparative studies demonstrated the efficacy of oral sitafloxacin in  otorhinolaryngological infections, urethritis in men, c. trachomatis-associated cervicitis in women and odontogenic infections. gastrointestinal disorders and laboratory abnormalities were the most commonly occurring adverse reactions in patients receiving oral sitafloxacin. adverse reactions reported in sitafloxacin  recipients in the active comparator trials were of mild to moderate severity.

TI  == perioperative, postoperative, and prophylactic use of antibiotics in alloplastic  total temporomandibular joint replacement surgery: a survey and preliminary guidelines.
AB  == purpose: in 2009, the american academy of orthopedic surgeons recommended lifelong prophylaxis after orthopedic total joint replacement (tjr) before these  patients undergo dental, aerodigestive, genitourinary (gu), and gastrointestinal  (gi) procedures. because oral and maxillofacial surgeons worldwide are implanting alloplastic total temporomandibular joint replacements (tmj tjrs), it appeared reasonable to survey these surgeons to obtain data that might shed some light, not only on this issue, but also to obtain some data to begin to develop preliminary guidelines for the peri- and postoperative use of antibiotics for tmj tjr using these results and the orthopedic data. materials and methods: a total of 35 surgeons worldwide, members of either the tmj concepts or biomet microfixation online networks were e-mailed a standard questionnaire surveying their perioperative, postoperative, and prophylactic use of antibiotics for their tmj tjr cases. results: of the 35 surgeons, 26 (74.2%) from 8 different countries responded. a total of 2,476 cases (3,368 joints) were retrospectively surveyed. of the responding surgeons, 96.2% used, in order of frequency, cefazolin, clindamycin, cephalosporin, or penicillin-based antibiotics in the perioperative  period and continued their use for a mean of 7 days (range 5 to 14) postoperatively. also, 46.2% soaked the tjr components either in the perioperative antibiotic or in vancomycin, poviodine, gentamycin, or peroxide before implantation. in addition, 61.5% irrigated the wounds after device implantation with bacitracin, vancomycin, poviodine, peroxide, or the perioperative antibiotic. these surgeons reported that 51 joints (1.51%) had become infected within a mean of 6 months (range 2 weeks to 12 years) postoperatively. a total of 32 devices (0.95%) required removal and/or replacement. in cases in which the organisms were isolated, the organisms commonly associated with biofilm infection of tjr devices, staphylococcus aureus, s epidermidis, peptostreptococcus, and pseudamonas aeruginosa, were cultured. in  only 1 joint (0.003%) was there a suggestion of an association with an invasive dental/aerodigestive, gu/gi procedure. regarding prophylaxis after tmj tjrs and before dental/aerodigestive, gu, or gi procedures, 53.8% of the respondents reported that they provided prophylaxis. of these, 1 recommended doing this for 6 months and 4 for 2 years, such as has been the american dental association/american academy of orthopedic surgeons recommendation since 2003; and 9 reported they believe these tmj tjr patients should have lifetime antibiotic prophylaxis before invasive dental/aerodigestive, gu, or gi procedures. conclusion: the evidence provided from the present small study survey and a review of the orthopedic data could provide the opportunity to develop guidelines for the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative antibiotic management for tmj tjrs and spur additional research into this important area of  patient management.

TI  == microbiology of sinusitis.
AB  == most sinus infections are viral, and only a small proportion develops a secondary bacterial infection. rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, and parainfluenza viruses are the most common causes of sinusitis. the most common bacteria isolated from pediatric and adult patients with community-acquired acute purulent sinusitis are streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pyogenes. staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria (prevotella  and porphyromonas, fusobacterium and peptostreptococcus spp.) are the main isolates in chronic sinusitis. pseudomonas aeruginosa and other aerobic and facultative gram-negative rods are commonly isolated from patients with nosocomial sinusitis, the immunocompromised host, those with hiv infection, and in cystic fibrosis. fungi and pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most common isolates in neutropenic patients. the microbiology of sinusitis is influenced by the previous antimicrobial therapy, vaccinations, and the presence of normal flora capable of interfering with the growth of pathogens.

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == evaluation of three swab transport systems for the maintenance of clinically important bacteria in simulated mono- and polymicrobial samples.
AB  == in this study, three swab transport systems were evaluated: m40 transystem, amies broth with a relatively new type of swab (both copan diagnostics, corona, ca, usa), and ssi transportmedium (statens serum institut, copenhagen denmark). the clsi m40-a standard procedures and 11 culture collection strains were used. the transport systems were tested at room temperature for holding times of 0, 24, and 48 h, and both mono- and polymicrobial samples were included. after 24 h of simulated transportation, all systems were able to maintain the viability of all  organisms tested. ssi transportmedium exhibited the lowest maintaining ability, whereas the two copan systems were the most growth-promoting system. in polymicrobial samples, this latter feature was a problem. at 48 h, no transport system could maintain the viability of all strains, and the recovery rates differed depending on organism and device. the species most difficult to recover  in all the three systems was neisseria gonorrhoeae. when selecting a swab transport system, consideration must be given to the sample type, the conditions  that prevail locally, and the performance in the clinical setting.

TI  == notes on the microbiology of cholesteatoma: clinical findings and treatment.
AB  == anomalous proliferation of the cholesteatoma epithelium is caused by extrinsic factors such as toxins or bacterial antigens combined with lytic enzymes, lymphokines and cytokines released from the inflammatory infiltrate. this could explain the close relationship between the aggressiveness of cholesteatoma and repeated bacterial superinfection, therefore it is very important to know the bacteria involved in order to control the regrowth of skin following surgery, reduce the aggressive potential of the cholesteatoma and limit the incidence of complications. this study focused on 70 females and 80 males aged between 15 and  65 years, affected by cholesteatomatous otitis media; all underwent bacteriological examination of the auricular secretion. the floral bacteria which proved to play the most important role (60.3%) were the aerobic type and the highest levels were those of pseudomonas aeruginosa (31.1%) followed by staphylococcus aureus (19.1%), proteus mirabilis (7.7%), escherichia coli (1.4%)  and klebsiella pneumoniae (1%). anaerobic floral bacteria were found in a fairly  high percentage of cases (38.2%); in particular, anaerobic gram-positive cocci (peptococcus 12.4% and peptostreptococcus in 4.8% of cases), bacteroides (12.4%), clostridium (3.8%), fusobacterium (2.9%) and propionobacterium (1.9%) were isolated. in 3 cases of mycetes (1.4%) only aspergillus, in association with pseudomonas and staphylococcus, was identified. the study showed, then, how effective second generation fluoroquinolones and third generation cephalosporins  are (the latter being used in pre-adolescent children), the reason being that these antibiotics work not only on pseudomonas and staphylococcus, but also on the anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == [diabetic foot infections. prevalence and antibiotic sensitivity of the causative microorganisms].
AB  == background: foot infections are a common reason for hospitalization and a cause of complications in patients with diabetes. the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of microorganisms found on culture in complicated diabetic foot infections in hospitalized patients, and the sensitivity of the causative microorganisms to antimicrobial agents. methods: between december 2001  and december 2005 in our department, 84 samples in 62 diabetic patients with moderate/severe infection were collected for microbiological study. results: at least one microorganism was isolated in 88% of samples. the most frequently isolated germ group was gram-positive bacteria (55% of the samples), with staphylococcus aureus (33%) in the first position, followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa (12%), enterococcus spp. (9%), and escherichia coli (8%). culture for  anaerobic microorganisms was only performed in half the samples; 25% were positive, and peptostreptococcus spp. predominated. among the multiresistant microorganisms, methicillin-resistant staphylococci aureus (mrsa) were the most common, accounting for 38% of the isolated strains of s. aureus, ie, 12% of all samples. as to the gram-negative microorganisms, nearly 30% of e. coli strains were resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and ciprofloxacin. conclusion: most of the cultures in our study were monomicrobial, with s. aureus being the most prevalent microorganism, followed by enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa. the main resistant microorganism in diabetic foot infections requiring hospitalization was methicillin-resistant golden staphylococcus, which was found in 12% of the series.

TI  == antibiotic-resistant obligate anaerobes during exacerbations of cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus are thought to cause the majority of lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (cf). however, other bacterial pathogens may contribute to the pathophysiology of lung disease. here,  obligate anaerobes were identified in a cross-sectional study, and cell numbers and antibiotic susceptibilities of facultative and obligate anaerobes from 114 sputum samples from nine children and 36 adults with cf were determined. furthermore, in 12 cf patients, we investigated whether conventional intravenous  antibiotic therapy, administered during acute exacerbations, would affect the numbers of obligate anaerobes. fifteen genera of obligate anaerobes were identified in 91% of the cf patients. cell numbers (mean: 2.2 x 10(7) +/- standard deviation 6.9 x 10(7) cfu/ml of sputum sample) were comparable to those  of p. aeruginosa and s. aureus. staphylococcus saccharolyticus and peptostreptococcus prevotii were most prevalent. infection with p. aeruginosa did not increase the likelihood that obligate anaerobes are present in sputum specimens. single obligate anaerobic species persisted for up to 11 months in sputum plugs in vivo. patients with and without obligate anaerobes in sputum specimens did not differ in lung function. intravenous therapy directed against p. aeruginosa during acute exacerbations increased lung function, but did not reduce the numbers of obligate anaerobes. obligate anaerobic species differed widely in their patterns of resistance against meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, clindamycin, metronidazole and ceftazidime. in 58% of patients with acute exacerbations, obligate anaerobes were detected that were resistant to the antibiotics used for treatment. antibiotic therapy, optimized to target anaerobes in addition to p. aeruginosa, may improve the management of cf lung disease.

TI  == effectiveness of ozone against endodontopathogenic microorganisms in a root canal biofilm model.
AB  == aim: to assess the antimicrobial efficacy of aqueous (1.25-20 microg ml(-1)) and  gaseous ozone (1-53 g m(-3)) as an alternative antiseptic against endodontic pathogens in suspension and a biofilm model. methodology: enterococcus faecalis,  candida albicans, peptostreptococcus micros and pseudomonas aeruginosa were grown in planctonic culture or in mono-species biofilms in root canals for 3 weeks. cultures were exposed to ozone, sodium hypochlorite (naocl; 5.25%, 2.25%), chlorhexidine digluconate (chx; 2%), hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2); 3%) and phosphate buffered saline (control) for 1 min and the remaining colony forming units counted. ozone gas was applied to the biofilms in two experimental settings, resembling canal areas either difficult (setting 1) or easy (setting 2) to reach. time-course experiments up to 10 min were included. to compare the tested samples, data were analysed by one-way anova. results: concentrations of gaseous ozone down to 1 g m(-3) almost and aqueous ozone down to 5 microg ml(-1)  completely eliminated the suspended microorganisms as did naocl and chx. hydrogen peroxide and lower aqueous ozone concentrations were less effective. aqueous and  gaseous ozone were dose- and strain-dependently effective against the biofilm microorganisms. total elimination was achieved by high-concentrated ozone gas (setting 2) and by naocl after 1 min or a lower gas concentration (4 g m(-3)) after at least 2.5 min. high-concentrated aqueous ozone (20 microg ml(-1)) and chx almost completely eliminated the biofilm cells, whilst h(2)o(2) was less effective. conclusion: high-concentrated gaseous and aqueous ozone was dose-, strain- and time-dependently effective against the tested microorganisms in suspension and the biofilm test model.

TI  == breast abscess bacteriologic features in the era of community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus epidemics.
AB  == hypothesis: increasing rates of community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) infections have also affected the microbial profile  of breast abscesses. objective: to update the decade-old bacteriologic description of breast abscesses to improve the choice of initial antibacterial drug therapy. design: retrospective case series. setting: county hospital emergency department. patients: forty-four women (mean age, 41 years; age range,  20-63 years) with breast abscesses. methods: all cultures from the breast abscesses of patients were reviewed. main outcome measures: the microbiologic features and sensitivities of breast abscesses. results: of 46 specimens only 28  showed bacterial yield (61%). of these, 11 (39%) were polymicrobial, for an average of 1.4 isolates per specimen. the most common organism was s aureus, present in 12 of 37 aerobic cultures (32%), with mrsa in 7 (58%). the remaining organisms included coagulase-negative staphylococcus (16%), diphtheroids (16%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), proteus mirabilis (5%), and other isolates (22%). all mrsa was sensitive to clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and linezolid. only 2 patients (29%) were sensitive to levofloxacin. two anaerobic cultures were positive for propionibacterium acnes and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. conclusions: staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogenic organism in modern breast abscesses. many breast abscesses have community-acquired mrsa, with more than 50% of all s aureus and 19% of all cultures being mrsa. this finding parallels the local and national increases in mrsa reported in other soft-tissue infections. with increasing bacterial resistance and more minimally invasive management of breast abscesses, understanding the current bacteriologic profile of these abscesses is essential to determining the correct empirical antibiotic drug therapy.

TI  == anaerobes in pleuropulmonary infections.
AB  == a total of 76 anaerobes and 122 aerobes were isolated from 100 patients with pleuropulmonary infections, e.g. empyema (64), pleural effusion (19) and lung abscess (13). in 14% of the patients, only anaerobes were recovered, while a mixture of aerobes and anaerobes was encountered in 58%. from all cases of lung abscess, anaerobic bacteria were isolated, alone (04) or along with aerobic bacteria (13). from empyema and pleural effusion cases, 65.6% and 68.4% anaerobes were recovered respectively. amongst anaerobes, gram negative anaerobic bacilli predominated (prevotella melaninogenicus 16, fusobacterium spp. 10, bacteroides spp. 9), followed by gram positive anaerobic cocci (peptostreptococcus spp. 31).  coliform bacteria (45) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (42) were the predominant aerobic isolates.

TI  == [characteristics of war wound infection].
AB  == war wounds are the most complex type of non-targeted injuries due to uncontrolled tissue damage of varied and multifold localizations, exposing sterile body areas  to contamination with a huge amount of bacteria. wound contamination is caused by both the host microflora and exogenous agents from the environment (bullets, cloth fragments, dust, dirt, water) due to destruction of the host protective barriers. war wounds are the consequence of destructive effects of various types  of projectiles, which result in massive tissue devitalization, hematomas, and compromised circulation with tissue ischemia or anoxia. this environment is highly favorable for proliferation of bacteria and their invasion in the surrounding tissue over a relatively short period of time. war wounds are associated with a high risk of local and systemic infection. the infection will develop unless a timely combined treatment is undertaken, including surgical intervention within 6 hours of wounding and antibiotic therapy administered immediately or at latest in 3 hours of wound infliction. time is a crucial factor in this type of targeted combined treatment consisting of surgical debridement, appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy, and specific antitetanic prophylaxis. apart from exposure factors, there are a number of predisposing factors that favor the development of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infection.  these are shock, pain, blood loss, hypoxia, hematomas, type and amount of traumatized tissue, age, and comorbidity factors in the wounded. the determinants that define the spectrum of etiologic agents in contaminated war wounds are: wound type, body region involved, time interval between wounding and primary surgical treatment, climate factors, season, geographical area, hygienic conditions, and patient habits. the etiologic agents of infection include gram-positive aerobic cocci, i. e. staphylococcus spp, streptococcus spp and enterococcus spp, which belong to the physiological flora of the human skin and mucosa; gram-negative facultative aerobic rods; members of the family enterobacteriacea (escherichia coil, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae), which predominate in the physiological flora of the intestines, transitory flora of the skin and environment; gram-negative bacteria, i. e. pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter calcoaceticus -  a. baumanii complex; environmental bacteria associated with humid environment and dust; anaerobic gram-positive sporogeneous rods clostridium spp, gram-negative asporogeneous rods bacteroides spp and gram-positive anaerobic cocci; peptostreptococcus spp and peptococcus spp. the latter usually colonize the intestine, primarily the colon, and the skin, while clostridium spores are also found in the environment. early empirical antibiotic therapy is used instead of standard antibiotic prophylaxis. empirical antimicrobial therapy is administered  to prevent the development of systemic infection, gas gangrene, necrotizing infection of soft tissue, intoxication and death. the choice of antibiotics is determined by the presumed infective agents and localization of the wound. it is  used in all types of war wounds over 5-7-10 days. the characteristics of antibiotics used in war wounds are the following: broad spectrum of activity, ability to penetrate deep into the tissue, low toxicity, long half-life, easy storage and application, and cost effectiveness. the use of antibiotics is not a  substitution for surgical treatment. the expected incidence of infection, according to literature data, is 35%-40%. if the time elapsed until surgical debridement exceeds 12 hours, or the administration of antibiotics exceeds 6 hours of wound infliction, primary infection of the war wound occurs (early infection) in more than 50% of cases. the keys for the prevention of infection are prompt and thorough surgical exploration of the wound, administration of antibiotics and antitetanic prophylaxis, awareness of the probable pathogens with respect to localization of the wound, and optimal choice of antibiotics and length of their administration.

TI  == bacterial etiology of diabetic foot infections in south india.
AB  == background: foot infections are a frequent complication of patients with diabetes mellitus, accounting for up to 20% of diabetes-related hospital admissions. infectious agents are associated with the worst outcomes, which may ultimately lead to amputation of the infected foot unless prompt treatment strategies are ensued. the present study sought to reveal the bacterial etiology of diabetic foot ulcers in south india, the diabetic capital of india. methods: a 10-month-long descriptive study was carried out to analyse the aerobic and anaerobic bacterial isolates of all patients admitted with diabetic foot infections presenting with wagner grade 2-5 ulcers. bacteriological diagnosis and antibiotic sensitivity profiles were carried out and analysed using standard procedures. results: diabetic polyneuropathy was found to be common (56.8%) and gram-negative bacteria (57.6%) were isolated more often than gram-positive ones (42.3%) in the patients screened. the most frequent bacterial isolates were pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), and enterobacteriaceaes. forty-nine cultures (68%) showed polymicrobial involvement. about 44% of p. aeruginosa were multi-drug-resistant, and mrsa was recovered on eight occasions (10.3%). bacteroides spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. were the major anaerobic isolates. conclusions: our study supports the viewpoint put forth by previous south indian authors that the distribution of gram-negative bacteria (57.6%) is more common than that of gram-positive ones (42.3%) and it is contrary to the viewpoint that diabetic foot infections are frequently monomicrobial. furthermore, recovery of multi-drug-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates is of serious concern, as almost no one has reported the same from the south indian milieu.

TI  == [bacterial infections in chronic otitis media--usefulness of molecular diagnostics based on pcr method].
AB  == infections in chronic otitis media (com) are common, and identification of their  pathogen is difficult, what is proven by high rate of negative results of bacteriological examinations. this fact may be explained by two factors: it is difficult to obtain a reliable material for culture and classic methods of bacteriological cultures may be of low sensitivity. amplification of bacterial dna in pcr is an examination, that leads to a higher effectiveness and sensitivity of bacteriological tests. the authors present material of 53 patients with com, previously untreated, in which bacteriological examinations by classic  and molecular pcr method were performed. the results of both methods were compared. in classic method the presence of pathogens was observed in 46 of 53 cases (86.8%). the most often isolated bacteria were pseudomonas aeruginosa (52.8% of the cases), staphylococcus aureus (15.1%), peptostreptococcus sp. and fusobacterium sp. (11.3% of the cases each) and proteus mirabilis (7.5%). in 7 cases (13.2%) bacteriological results were negative. using molecular diagnostic of pcr, the presence of pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed in 42 cases (79.2%).  isolated strains of p. aeruginosa were epidemiologically unrelated (93.7% of isolates), what was proven in pcr-finger-printing technique. the authors stated that predominant aerobes pathogens in com are p. aeruginosa and s. aureus and the pcr technique for identification of bacterial dna presence is very sensitive and  allows to precipitate diagnostics of patients with com. combination of classical  bacteriological tests with pcr technique may be very helpful in estimation bacteriological condition of patients with com.

AB  == background: anaerobic cocci are estimated to be present in the deep tissues of over 50% of chronic skin wounds. while the part they play in the chronicity of these wounds is uninvestigated, anaerobic cocci have previously been shown to be  involved in other chronic inflammatory human conditions. methods: in this study the anaerobic microflora of the deep tissues of 18 patients with refractory chronic venous leg ulcers (mean age 80.3 years; mean duration > 24 months) was characterized using strict anaerobic culture conditions. the effect of the anaerobic organisms isolated from these tissues on extracellular matrix (ecm) proteolysis and cellular wound healing responses was studied using in vitro models. results: anaerobic organisms were present in the deep tissues of 14 of 18 wounds and were principally peptostreptococcus spp. the effects of three peptostreptococcus spp. isolated from these wounds (p. magnus, p. vaginalis and p. asaccharolyticus) on cellular wound healing responses were compared with those of two pathogenic organisms also isolated from these wounds (pseudomonas aeruginosa and citrobacter diversus). while the direct ecm proteolytic activity exhibited by the peptostreptococcus spp. was limited, they did significantly inhibit both fibroblast and keratinocyte proliferation, but only at high concentrations. however, at lower concentrations peptostreptococcal supernatants  profoundly inhibited keratinocyte wound repopulation and endothelial tubule formation. the magnitude of these effects varied between strains and they were distinct from those demonstrated by pseudomonas aeruginosa and citrobacter diversus. conclusions: these studies confirm the importance of anaerobic organisms in chronic wounds and demonstrate an indirect, strain-specific mechanism by which these microorganisms may play a part in mediating the chronicity of these wounds.

TI  == acute bacterial suppurative parotitis: microbiology and management.
AB  == the parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. the most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial parotitis are staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. the predominant anaerobes include gram-negative bacilli (including pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp.), fusobacterium spp., and peptostreptococcus spp. streptococcus spp. (including s.  pneumoniae) and gram-negative bacilli (including escherichia coli) have also been reported. gram-negative organisms are often seen in hospitalized patients. organisms less frequently found are arachnia, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, salmonella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, treponema pallidum, cat-scratch bacillus, and eikenella corrodens. mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of parotitis. therapy includes maintenance  of hydration and administration of parenteral antimicrobial therapy. once an abscess has formed surgical drainage is required. the choice of antimicrobial depends on the etiologic agent. maintenance of good oral hygiene, adequate hydration, and early and proper therapy of bacterial infection of the oropharynx  may reduce the occurrence of suppurative parotitis.

TI  == ertapenem: a new carbapenem.
AB  == ertapenem is a new 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase, which binds preferable to penicillin-binding proteins (pbp) 2 and 3. ertapenem has a broad antibacterial spectrum with mic90 values < 0.5 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella spp., serratia spp.,  proteus spp., clostridium perfringens, fusobacterium spp. peptostreptococcus spp. and anaerobic streptococcus spp. ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action as shown by time-killing curves and exhibits a short pae of 1.4 - 2.6 h against the gram-positive strains but no pae against gram-negative strains. in an infection model in mice, it has been shown that ertapenem and imipenem were highly efficacious at a level of 2 mg/kg in bacterial clearance in comparison to  ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefotaxime and meropenem. in comparison to other available carbapenems, ertapenem has a long half-life of 4.5 h and is developed as a single daily dose carbapenem. the protein binding is dose-dependent and is estimated to 94% at concentrations under 100 mg/l and approximately 85% at 300 mg/l. cmax after a dose of 1 g in healthy volunteers has been estimated to 190 mg/l. given the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, it may be predicted that ertapenem will have an effect on most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. for pathogens with a mic of 0.5 mg/l, the estimated t > mic will be 50% (of 24 h) and for pathogens with a mic of 1 mg/l 31%. for anaerobic bacteria with mic values between 1-2 mg/l, the t > mic may not be sufficient for bacterial eradication. however, clinical trials have to confirm this hypothesis.

AB  == aspirates of 108 chronically inflamed maxillary sinuses were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. there were 295 bacterial isolates: 109 aerobic and facultative, and 186 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were staphylococcus aureus (17 isolates), alpha-hemolytic streptococci (14), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12), moraxella catarrhalis (10), and haemophilus spp (8). the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus spp (61), prevotella spp (45),  fusobacterium spp (15), and propionibacterium acnes (14). analysis of the medical histories revealed a correlation only between the microbial results and previous  sinus surgery. pseudomonas aeruginosa and gram-negative aerobic bacilli (gnab) were more often isolated in patients who had surgery (9 of 33 patients had p aeruginosa and 17 had gnab) than in patients who did not have surgery (3 of 75 had p aeruginosa and 7 had gnab; p < .001). anaerobes were isolated more often in patients who did not have surgery (69 of 75 patients) than in those who had previous surgery (21 of 33 patients; p < .001). these findings illustrate the unique microbiological features of chronic maxillary sinusitis that persist after sinus surgery.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of biapenem in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  == biapenem is a new injectable carbapenem antibiotic which has favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and is stable to hydrolysis by dehydropeptidase i. biapenem inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, bacteroides fragilis and prevotella bivia at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. the mic(90) of biapenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa was lower than that of panipenem, equivalent to that of imipenem, and greater than that of meropenem. the in vivo efficacy of biapenem was evaluated using the experimental infection model of uterine endometritis. the accumulation of neutrophils in the uterus in the biapenem- treated group was less marked than in the nontreated group, as well as bacteriological response. these results suggest that the new antimicrobial agent  biapenem might be useful for the treatment of polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.

TI  == the microbiology of infected and noninfected leg ulcers.
AB  == background: a clinical study was undertaken to investigate and compare specifically the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of infected and noninfected leg ulcers. methods: leg ulcers, defined as being infected on the basis of clinical signs, were swab sampled and investigated for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms using stringent isolation and identification techniques. results:  two hundred and twenty isolates were cultured from 44 infected leg ulcers, in comparison with 110 isolates from 30 noninfected leg ulcers. statistical analysis indicated a significantly greater mean number of anaerobic bacteria per infected  ulcer (particularly peptostreptococcus spp. and prevotella spp.) in comparison with the noninfected ulcer group (2.5 vs. 1.3, respectively) (p < 0.05). also, anaerobes represented 49% of the total microbial composition in infected leg ulcers compared with 36% in noninfected leg ulcers. the mean numbers of aerobes per wound in the two ulcer groups were not statistically different (p > 0.05). the study failed to demonstrate a clear correlation between commonly implicated facultative pathogens and wound infection. the isolation rate of pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low and, although staphylococcus aureus was a frequent isolate in both wound types, it was more prevalent in noninfected leg ulcers. conclusions: this study has demonstrated the complex aerobic-anaerobic microflora which exists in leg ulcers, the prevalence of anaerobes in infected wounds, and a poor correlation between the presence of specific aerobic pathogens and wound infection. in view of these findings, the role of microbial synergistic interactions in the pathogenesis of chronic wound infection may be of greater clinical importance than the isolated involvement of any specific potential pathogen.

(5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

(7), moraxella catarrhalis (6), klebsiella pneumoniae (5) and non-typable haemophilus influenzae (5). commonly isolated anaerobes were peptostreptococcus sp. (25 isolates), prevotella sp. (10), bacteroides sp. (8) and fusobacterium sp. (6). pseudomonas aeruginosa and s. aureus were more often isolated in children older then 6 years. these findings demonstrate the polymicrobial bacteriology of tt-related otorrhea in children. specimens collected from the external auditory canals can be misleading. reliable information can be obtained from the ear exudes when collected through the tt or  through the open perforation after their removal.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of clarithromycin against recent obtained clinical isolates].
AB  == in order to evaluate antimicrobial activities of clarithromycin (cam), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cam and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates that were obtained from outpatients in 1994 and 1996. the results are summarized as follows; 1. it was not showed that cam-resistant strains were increasing among staphylococcus spp., beta-streptococci, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, bordetella pertussis, campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni, chlamydia trachomatis and mycoplasma pneumoniae. it appeared that resistances to cam and macrolides (mls) were increasing among streptococcus pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp. 2. the drug susceptibility patterns to mls were similar and detection frequencies of induced  resistant strains that were resistant to only 14-membered ring mls including cam  and constitutive resistant strains that were resistant to 14 and 16-membered ring mls were high among streptococcus pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp. it appears that mls-resistance systems are linked to each other, and that this was a cause of increasing mls-resistance among these bacterial species. 3. notwithstanding of antibiotic resistance problems, cam is still useful since it maintains strong antimicrobial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, b. pertussis, c. jejuni subsp. jejuni, c. trachomatis and m. pneumoniae, and it controls arginate producing abilities of mucoide strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == periodontal microflora of hiv infected patients with periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the microbial profile of periodontal lesions in hiv seropositive patients and to compare it with rapidly progressing periodontal lesions in systemically healthy patients. the subgingival microflora  of 20 cdc ii, 20 cdc iii, 20 cdc iv/v and 20 systemically healthy patients with rapidly progressing periodontitis was examined. four sites with greatest probing  depth in each patient were selected for microbiological sampling. the samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. the microflora of periodontitis lesions within the three stages of the hiv infection was similar to that of progressing periodontitis in systemically healthy adults including campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, selenomonas spp. and peptostreptococcus micros. however, hiv seropositive periodontitis lesions harboured a range of exogenous pathogens rarely associated with common types of periodontitis including staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloaca, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus avium, clostridium difficile, aspergillus fumigatus, klebsiella pneumoniae and mycoplasma incognitum. the lack of immune effector and regulatory cells in hiv infected patients could in fact explain the increase of some opportunistic pathogens and the characteristic and rapidly progressing nature of the periodontal disease in these patients.

TI  == in vitro activity of the tricyclic beta-lactam gv104326.
AB  == gv104326 is a novel tricyclic beta-lactam (a trinem or, formerly, tribactam). the in vitro activity of gv104326 was compared with those of cefuroxime, cefixime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefpirome, and ciprofloxacin. gv104326  had in vitro activity generally similar to that of cefixime against members of the family enterobacteriaceae (mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [mic90], < or = 2 micrograms/ml), with cefuroxime and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid being 8- to 32-fold less active and with cefpirome being 4- to 8-fold more active against members of this family. the trinem had no activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa or stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, > 128 micrograms/ml) but was the most active agent against acinetobacter calcoaceticus. gv104326 was particularly active against gram-positive cocci. ninety percent of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains were susceptible to 0.03 microgram of gv104326 per ml, making it the most active agent studied. enterococci and lancefield group a and b streptococci were generally equally or somewhat more susceptible to gv104326 than they were to amoxicillin. streptococcus pneumoniae strains were highly susceptible to gv104326, and those strains which showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin were generally twofold more susceptible to the trinem than to amoxicillin. haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were highly susceptible to gv104326 (mic90s, 0.12 and 0.03 microgram/ml, respectively). the anaerobes clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, and peptostreptococcus spp. were more susceptible to the trinems (formerly tribactams) than to the other agents studied.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis. a prospective study using ultrasound-guided transthoracic needle aspiration.
AB  == obstructive pneumonitis, the opacity that develops distal to an obstructing endobronchial lesion or external compression, is actually a combination of atelectasis, bronchiectasis with mucus plugging, and true parenchymal inflammation. in the majority of cases, it is usually not possible to determine whether infection is present or not from the radiographic findings alone. the aim of this study was to evaluate the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis and the influence of this result on the treatment of patients. from march 1992 to february 1993, 26 consecutive patients (20 men and six women) with obstructive pneumonitis were investigated. the obstructive pneumonitis had been caused by malignant tumors in 24 and benign lesions in two. chest ultrasound (us) and us-guided percutaneous transthoracic aspirations were undergone to obtain specimens for microbiologic examination. microorganisms were isolated from seven  of nine febrile patients and two of 17 nonfebrile patients. a total of 16 bacterial strains are detected in obstructive pneumonitis (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, viridant streptococci, bacteroides fragilis, two peptostreptococcus species, mycobacterium tuberculosis, pseudomonas maltophilia, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides thetaiotamomicrons, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides species, veillonella species, aerobic gram-positive bacilli, and escherichia coli). in five cases the  isolates were monobacteriae, and in the remaining four cases, cultures yielded more than one bacteria. the results of aspirate cultures led to changes in the initial antibiotic trial in seven of nine patients, and fever subsided thereafter. pneumothorax occurred in one cases as the sole complication. the pathogen causing obstructive pneumonitis is very heterogeneous, and polymicrobial infection is common.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == microbiological and clinical data from 46 patients with external otitis were retrospectively evaluated. specimens were processed for isolation of aerobic and  anaerobic bacteria. a total of 42 aerobic bacteria, 22 anaerobic bacteria, and 3  candida albicans organisms were recovered. aerobic bacteria only were isolated from 31 patients (67%), anaerobic bacteria only were isolated from 8 (17%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 4 (9%). c. albicans alone was recovered from two patients (4%), and the organism was mixed with aerobic bacteria in one case (2%). the most common isolates were pseudomonas aeruginosa (19 instances), peptostreptococcus species (11), staphylococcus aureus (7), and bacteroides species (5). one isolate was recovered from 30 patients (65%), 2 isolates were recovered from 11 (24%), and 3 isolates were recovered from 5 (11%). beta-lactamase activity was detected in 32 isolates recovered from 27 specimens (59%). these data illustrate the polymicrobial nature of external otitis in one-third of the patients and the role of anaerobic bacteria in one-quarter of them. further prospective studies are warranted for evaluating the role of anaerobic bacteria in this infection and the therapeutic implications of  these findings.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of du-6859, a new potent fluoroquinolone, against clinical isolates.
AB  == du-6859, (-)-7-[(7s)-amino-5-azaspiro(2,4)heptan-5-yl]-8-chloro-6- fluoro-1-[(1r,2r)-cis-2-fluoro-1-cyclopropyl]-1,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinol one-3- carboxylic acid, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity which is significantly better than those of currently available quinolones. the mics for 90% of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis clinical isolates (mic90s) were 0.1, 3.13, 0.1, and 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. mic50s of du-6859 against quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant s. aureus were 8-, 32-, 64-, and 128-fold lower than those  of tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. du-6859 inhibited the growth of all strains of streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes at 0.1 and 0.2 microgram/ml,  respectively, and was more active against enterococci than the other quinolones tested. although the activity of du-6859 against pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to that of ciprofloxacin at the mic50 level, it was fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin at the mic90 level. du-6859 was also more active against other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, than the other drugs tested. strains of bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus spp. were susceptible to du-6859; mic90s were 0.39 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively. du-6859 generally showed activities twofold or greater than those of ciprofloxacin and the other drugs against almost all members of the family enterobacteriaceae. the action of du-6859 against the clinical isolates was bactericidal at concentrations near the mics. du-6859 activity was not affected by different media, ph, inoculum size, or human serum but was decreased in human urine.

TI  == [antibacterial activities of ofloxacin against recent isolates from patients with community-acquired infections].
AB  == in order to survey antibacterial activities of ofloxacin (oflx) against 1,440 bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired infections in 1987 and 1990, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the drug as well as those of other new quinolones and oral cephems were determined. the following conclusions were reached. 1. comparison of the mic distribution for strains isolated in 1987 with those in 1990 suggested a tendency toward an increase in the frequency of oflx-resistant isolates with the passage of time of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella ssp., enterobacter spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. most common elevations of mic  values against these bacteria were observed in mic80 and mic90 values, while no significant alteration was observed in mic50 values. however, mic50's of oflx against serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa were relatively high for strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. most of the oflx-resistant strains of s.  aureus seemed to be methicillin-resistant (mrsa). furthermore, mic80 of oflx against coagulase-negative staphylococci was high in strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. 2. susceptibility of streptococcus spp. was evaluated only in strains isolated in 1990. the results were comparable to those reported by others in the early 1980s. 3. bacteria which showed no or infrequent emergence of oflx-resistant strains even in 1990 were proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, campylobacter spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. 4. recently isolated strains from patients with community-acquired infections showed a tendency toward an increase of the frequency of oflx-resistant strains among many bacteria. however, the bacteria which contained high percentages of oflx-resistant strains except for mrsa were so-called less-virulent bacteria, and in the other bacteria elevations of mic values were only observed in mic80 and mic90. these results suggested that oflx preserved a potent antibacterial activity against bacteria which were major causative pathogens in community-acquired infections.

AB  == fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (ipm/cs) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. there were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9  with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with  fever of unknown origin. forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. the overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. the efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. bacteriologically, staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), streptococcus  pneumoniae (5), streptococcus pyogenes (1), other gram-positive coccus (1), klebsiella pneumoniae (8), haemophilus influenzae (4), pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), serratia marcescens (3), escherichia coli (3), branhamella catarrhalis (1),  citrobacter freundii (1), klebsiella oxytoca (1), enterobacter sp. (1), and peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. p. aeruginosa (3) and acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. s. aureus (1), s. epidermidis (1), p. aeruginosa (5), and s. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. the eradication rate was 83.7%. six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of s-got 2. but all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. these findings indicate that ipm/cs is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against fresh clinical isolates from superficial suppurative foci].
AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (cpfx), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of cpfx against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. the clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. interpreting mic level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. when activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, cpfx expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (oflx) and norfloxacin (nflx) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of cpfx against bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of oflx, and cpfx had similar activity against staphylococcus aureus to oflx. 2. in comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, cpfx was inferior to amoxicillin (ampc) against e. faecalis and inferior to ampc and cefaclor (ccl) against peptostreptococcus spp.  against all other bacterial species, however, cpfx expressed superior antibacterial potency to ampc and ccl. 3. scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to cpfx were observed among the s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. faecium, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, p. aeruginosa and b. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of e. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.

TI  == microbial aspects of failing osseointegrated dental implants in humans.

TI  == microbiological and clinical aspects of aspiration pneumonia.
AB  == aspiration pneumonia is characterized by a pneumonitis in a dependent segment of  the lung with typical necrosis or abscess-formation in the parenchyma. observed aspiration or predisposition to aspiration, cavitation or abscess formation, with or without empyema fluid and isolation of distinctive micro-organisms are important clues to the diagnosis. diagnostic procedures to collect anaerobic uncontaminated secretions are transtracheal aspiration, blood cultures, pleural fluid aspiration, fibreoptic bronchoscopic protected investigations and percutaneous transthoracic aspiration. leading pathogens in more than 90% are anaerobic bacteria, mostly species of bacteroides, fusobacterium, peptococcus and peptostreptococcus; aerobic bacteria include staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative bacilli, mainly klebsiella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa. treatment depends on bacteriological results; penicillin g and clindamycin are the most useful antibiotics against anaerobes and should be administered over a long period of time (4-12 weeks), adjusted to the clinical course of the individual patient.

AB  == the addition of gelatin to blood culture media has been suggested to prevent the  inhibition of neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, gardnerella vaginalis, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius that is caused by sodium polyanetholsulfonate. to determine the effect of such supplementation on the overall yield of microorganisms, we compared the yield and speed of detection of  clinically important microorganisms from 5422 paired 10-ml samples of blood cultured in trypticase soy broth (tsb) containing 0.03% sodium polyanetholesulfonate (sps) and tsb/sps containing 1.2% gelatin and 1.0% yeast extract (mtsb). the atmosphere of incubation (open venting unit) and ratio of blood to broth (1:5) were the same for both samples. only cultures with adequate  blood sample (greater than or equal to 80% of stated volume) were compared statistically. addition of gelatin and yeast extract resulted in inhibited growth of enterobacteriaceae (p less than 0.001), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p less than 0.01), fungi (p less than 0.05), and the overall set of microorganisms encountered (p less than 0.001). it delayed growth of enterobacteriaceae (p less  than 0.001) but reduced the time to recover staphylococci (p less than 0.02). of  12 isolates of species usually inhibited by sps, seven grew only with the addition of gelatin and yeast extract, none grew only without supplementation, and five grew in both media. although gelatin and yeast extract may improve the yield of some specific bacteria, the routine use of these additives cannot be recommended for all blood culture media.

TI  == use of intravenous ciprofloxacin in difficult-to-treat infections.
AB  == intravenous ciprofloxacin was administered to 54 patients who were either critically ill or in whom oral administration was not possible. the 31 males and  23 females ranged in age from 20 to 89 years (mean, 53.2 +/- 17.8 years). patients had "difficult-to-treat" infections, i.e., respiratory infections (15),  abscesses (four intraabdominal, three lung, two soft tissue, and one intrahepatic), deep soft tissue infections (10), chronic post-traumatic osteomyelitis in exacerbation (nine), upper urinary tract infection (five), malignant external otitis (two), catheter-related bacteremia (two), and infectious endocarditis (one). thirty patients (56 percent) had serious associated medical problems. pathogens included pseudomonas aeruginosa (38 isolates), acinetobacter species (10 isolates), enterobacter cloacae (eight isolates), escherichia coli (two isolates), proteus mirabilis (one isolate), kingella kingae (one isolate), bacteroides fragilis (eight isolates), and peptostreptococcus species (five isolates). minimal inhibitory concentrations of  ciprofloxacin ranged from 0.003 to 2 micrograms/ml. in 39 patients, the isolated  microorganisms were multi-resistant; resistance included ceftazidime and amikacin in 32 patients. in 24 patients, ciprofloxacin was given exclusively by the intravenous route at a dose of 200 mg every 12 hours; in 30 patients, treatment was completed after discontinuation of the parenteral drug with the oral preparation of ciprofloxacin at a dose of 750 mg every 12 hours. the duration of  parenteral treatment ranged from six to 40 days (mean, 14.9 days). a successful clinical response was observed in 49 patients (91 percent), while five (9 percent) failed to show a response. bacteriologic outcomes were as follows: eradication of pathogen in 33 patients (61.1 percent), persistence in 18 (33.3 percent), and relapse in three (5.6 percent), with development of resistance to ciprofloxacin in nine patients (16.7 percent) and superinfection in two patients  (3.7 percent). side effects included vein irritation at the site of the infusion  (three patients), abnormal elevation in liver enzyme levels (two patients), reversible renal failure (one patient), and nausea (one patient). parenteral ciprofloxacin is a safe, well-tolerated, and effective therapy for the critically ill patient, and can be replaced with the oral form when clinically appropriate.

TI  == [bacterial infection agents in hospitalized patients].
AB  == during six months the pattern of microbial isolates has been analysed from 1492 urinary tract infections, from 1445 wound infections, from 451 bronchial secretions, from 3067 blood cultures, from 116 peritoneal swabs and from 39 cerebrospinal fluids. all the specimens investigated were taken from patients of  surgical, neurosurgical, internal wards and two intensive care units. in total, the most frequent isolates were grampositive microorganisms like staphylococus aureus, straphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus sp. of different serotypes. out of the enterobacteriaceae escherichia coli and klebisella pneumoniae predominated followed by enterobacter cloacae and indolnegative and -positive proteus species. the over all isolation rate of pseudomonas aeruginosa in nosocomial infections was about 10%. in the last time pseudomonas maltophilia will be isolated more frequently as well as occasional streptococcus faecium and  corynebacterium jk. dependent from the site of infection anaerobic bacteria like  bacteroides sp., peptococcus- and peptostreptococcus sp. are really important in  the infectious diseases. the epidemiological data should be always transmitted to the infection control board. from there preventive measures must be induced.

TI  == pathogenicity of clostridium species with other bacteria in mixed infections.
AB  == the relationship of clostridial isolates with other bacteria in mixed infections  was studied by means of a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. we used 26 isolates of seven clostridial species, two bacteroides spp., eight gram-positive facultative or anaerobic cocci and three enteric gram-negative aerobic rods. abscesses were induced by all seven clostridium perfringens and three c. butyricum isolates and by some of the others. selective antimicrobial therapy experiments showed that enteric gram-negative rods were of equal or greater significance in the formation of abscesses than were clostridial strains in mixed infections. enhancement or suppression of each component of the mixed infection was studied by comparing the number of each bacterium to its number when injected alone. enhancement was observed mainly with c. perfringens in mixed infections. by contrast, other clostridium spp. were less able to induce enhancement. clostridium difficile and c. sporogenes often inhibited other bacterial species.  this study demonstrated the synergistic and antagonistic relationship between clostridial species and other bacteria.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftazidime in combination with other antibiotics.
AB  == 189 bacterial strains were investigated for their in vitro sensitivity against ceftazidime (alone and in combination with another antibiotic). moreover, the possibility to prevent development of secondary bacterial resistance as observed  in subcultures at subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations, was studied using specific antibiotic combinations. of 115 staphylococcal strains (91 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 24 strains of staphylococcus epidermidis), 2% were sensitive, 82% were moderately sensitive and 16% were resistant to ceftazidime. on combining ceftazidime with vancomycin, synergism was found in 61% of the strains, and secondary resistance to ceftazidime could be prevented with this combination. the combination of ceftazidime and clindamycin showed synergism in 26% and an additive effect in 48% of the strains. secondary resistance to ceftazidime did not develop with this combination in subcultures at subinhibitory concentrations in which loss of activity was only minimal with clindamycin alone. rifampicin and fusidic acid were highly active against staphylococci. in combination with ceftazidime, only weak synergism or additive effects were seen in most strains; no antagonism could be observed. in subcultures at subinhibitory concentrations, secondary resistance to rifampicin and fusidic acid developed rapidly and could be partially prevented by adding ceftazidime. of 60 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 84% were sensitive, 13% were moderately sensitive and 2% were resistant to ceftazidime. synergism was most frequently observed when ceftazidime was combined with tobramycin. using this combination, secondary resistance of pseudomonas strains to ceftazidime did not develop. when ceftazidime was combined with piperacillin, synergism was observed in most strains, but the development of secondary resistance in vitro was not prevented.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == comparative clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin vs. cefotaxime in treatment of severe bacterial infections.
AB  == adult patients with severe bacterial infections caused by organisms susceptible to imipenem and cefotaxime were given either imipenem/cilastatin sodium (mk0787/mk0791) or cefotaxime as a part of a multiclinic randomized study to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of imipenem/cilastatin. clinical diagnoses included bacteremia, urinary tract infection, osteomyelitis, mediastinitis, lower respiratory tract infection, and soft tissue infection. efficacy was evaluated for 10 patients given imipenem/cilastatin and for 10 patients given cefotaxime. major pathogens isolated included staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella species, streptococcus pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and peptostreptococcus species. satisfactory clinical responses were noted in 90% of the patients in both treatment groups. eradication of the pathogen was achieved in nine of 10 patients treated with imipenem/cilastatin and in 10 of 10 patients treated with cefotaxime. no major adverse effects were found in patients in each treatment group. the results of this study suggest that imipenem/cilastatin sodium is a relatively safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of adult patients with severe infections caused by susceptible organisms.

TI  == [studies of isolated organisms from otorhinolaryngological infections and their susceptibilities to macrolide antibiotics].
AB  == to study current situation of pathogenic bacteria and their drug resistance to macrolide antibiotics in the otorhinolaryngological infections, 609 strains diagnosed as pathogen derived from 463 patients were collected from cohospitals or institutions during the period of 1980-1983. the results obtained were as follows: gram-positive cocci (gpc) was dominant (410 strains) and major species were s. aureus (135 strains), s. pneumoniae (81 strains), s. epidermidis (68 strains) and s. pyogenes (65 strains). in gram-negative bacteria giving 147 strains and 43 strains, of anaerobes prevailing species were h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and peptostreptococcus spp. representative species in the diseases were s. aureus (26.6%), s. epidermidis (24.5%), and p. aeruginosa (12.8%) in acute otitis media, s. aureus (34.4%), s. epidermidis (17.7%) and p. aeruginosa (14.6%) in acute exacerbation of chronic otitis media, s. epidermidis (17.0%), s. aureus (16.1%) and h. influenzae (13.4%) in acute paranasal sinusitis, s. pyogenes (29.1%), s. pneumoniae (19.6%) and s. aureus (15.1%) in acute tonsillitis. although most of isolates were susceptible to macrolides, 62 resistant strains to macrolides were found in 501 strains and the resistant rates were 26.7% in s. aureus, 23.1% in s. epidermidis and 6.5% in s. pyogenes. the resistant pattern was somewhat different against each macrolides, resistant strains giving over 100 micrograms/ml in mic were 55/62 in erythromycin, 35/62 in josamycin and midecamycin and 7/62 in tms-19-q, a new macrolide.

TI  == bactericidal effects of photoradiation therapy with hematoporphyrin derivative.
AB  == hematoporphyrin derivative (hpd) localizes selectively in malignant and rapidly metabolizing tissues and undergoes a cytotoxic reaction when exposed to light of  a specific wavelength. hpd has been studied extensively with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of tumors but not with regard to bactericidal activity. this investigation assessed the effect of light-activated hpd on various microorganisms, on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and on the interactions of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and bacteria. light-activated hpd was 99.9% bactericidal against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, streptococcus m-g intermedius, streptococcus mutans, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptococcus magnus, and clostridium perfringens, but did not affect escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or candida albicans. photoactivation of hpd rendered 98% of polymorphonuclear leukocytes inviable. combinations of light-activated hpd and polymorphonuclear leukocytes had a 4-log (99.99%) bactericidal effect on both intra- and extracellular s. aureus. the ability of hpd to localize in inflammatory tissues may have therapeutic applications in the  treatment of abscesses.

TI  == susceptibility of brain to aerobic, anaerobic, and fungal organisms.
AB  == the utility of an experimental animal model is dependent on its ability to simulate the actual clinical situation. with a stereotaxic injection procedure, the susceptibility of rat brain to the spectrum of organisms commonly associated  with human brain abscess was determined. two strains of escherichia coli were more infective than pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pyogenes. even between the e. coli strains it was possible to document significant differences in degree of infectivity. the e. coli strain with the k-1 capsular polysaccharide was significantly more infective than the e. coli strain without the capsular polysaccharide. the brain was also susceptible to candida albicans, but at a level higher than any of the aerobic bacteria examined. brain infection could not be created when microaerophilic or obligately anaerobic organisms alone were injected.

TI  == bacterial interference between clostridium difficile and normal fecal flora.
AB  == clostridium difficile has been shown to be the cause of virtually all cases of pseudomembranous colitis related to the administration of antimicrobial agents. it is possible that some antimicrobial agents alter the normal bacterial flora of the gastrointestinal tract so as to permit colonization and/or proliferation by c. difficile. the inhibitory activity of representative fecal bacteria from 23 anaerobic and aerobic genera against c. difficile was examined using two in vitro procedures. strains of bacteria in six of the genera inhibited the multiplication of c. difficile, with lactobacillus organisms and group d enterococci displaying  the most antagonistic activity. c. difficile was examined for its ability to inhibit the multiplication of several fecal strains of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. all eight strains of c. difficile tested inhibited the growth of particular strains of bacteria in the genera bacteroides, peptococcus, and peptostreptococcus.

TI  == effects of storage in an anaerobic transport system on bacteria in known polymicrobial mixtures and in clinical specimens.
AB  == an anaerobic transport system (ats) which provides for catalytic removal of oxygen was evaluated by using in vitro-prepared polymicrobial mixtures of logphase bacteria and clinical specimens. inoculated swabs were stored at room temperature in (i) aerobic, (ii) anaerobic glove box, and (iii) ats environments, and bacteria were quantitated after 2, 24, 48, and 72 h. bacteria in a three-part mixture of bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and escherichia coli and in a five-part mixture of b. fragilis, p. anaerobius, fusobacterium nucleatum, staphylococcus epidermidis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa survived 72 h of storage in the ats and anaerobic glove box environments, but the anaerobic species were inactivated in the aerobic storage except for b. fragilis in pure culture or in the three-part mixture. changes in relative proportions among the species in a mixture were least in the ats and anaerobic glove box environments and greatest during the aerobic storage, particularly in the five-part mixture. bacteria present in pure or mixed culture in clinical specimens generally survived 72 h of storage in the ats. these data indicate that changes in relative proportions occur with prolonged storage even under anaerobic conditions, but that the ats would be most effective for preserving anaerobic bacteria and preventing drastic concentration changes and overgrowth of facultative and aerobic bacteria.

TI  == deconjugation of bile acids by human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the purpose of this report is to present the deconjugation of bile acids by numbers of strains of bacteria in the small intestine and feces. the small intestinal juice was aseptically aspirated by a double lumen tube with a rubber cover on the tip devised by us ("fukushima type 1"). bile acids were analyzed with thin layer chromatography. the results: 1) among aerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split conjugated bile acids was enterococcus, and most of the strains split were staphylococcus (s.) epidermidis and lactobacillus  (l.) bifidus. species of which none of the strains split were escherichia (e.) coli, e. communior, e. freundii, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. buchneri, l. cellobiosus, l. bulgaricus, s. aureus, aerobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida, proteus, serratia, and almost none of the species split was  intermediate coliform bacilli. 2) among anaerobic bacteria, species of which all  of the strains split were bacteroides (b.) vulgatus, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis, corynebacterium (c.) granulosum, c. avidum, peptostreptococcus (peptostrept.) putridus, eubacterium (eubact.) lentum, peptococcus (pept.) grigoroffii, pept. anaerobius, veillonella (v.) orbiculus, and most of the strains split were coryne. diphtheroides, eubact. parvum, peptostrept. intermedius. species of which none of the strains split were coryne, parvum, peptostrept. micros, v. alcalescens, v. parvula, catenabacterium (catena.) catenaforme, and catena. filamentosum. 3) all or none, or almost all or none, of  the strains of each species tested split conjugated bile acids, and it seems probably that the presence or absence of this ability would be a proper character of eachspecies.

AB  == the capacity of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to survive on cotton swabs placed  into a dry gassed-out co2-filled tube (dgt), dry sterile aerobic tube (dat), and  a tube containing a modified stuarts' transport medium (mst), was assessed. pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in numbers by 2 and 3 logs when stored in mst and dat, respectively. the viability of p. aeruginosa, although retarded when compared to msa and dat, was not adversely affected by the co2 environment in the dgt. the mst maintained relatively constant numbers of streptococcus pyogenes during the 48-h storage period. the dat and the dgt were unable to maintain the viability of s. pyogenes. staphylococcus aureus, when stored in a dgt, dat, or mst, was maintained in relatively constant numbers throughout the entire storage  period. of the four anaerobic bacteria evaluated (bacteroides fragilis ssp. thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides melaninogenicus ssp. asaccharolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius), only b. fragilis ssp. thetaiotamicron survived the 48-h storage period in the dgt. under these test conditions the dgt did not adequately maintain the viability of the majority of anaerobic bacteria tested (when held on cotton swabs). however, the mst did maintain the viability of all species tested for at least the first 2 h of storage.
