TI  - Presence of quorum-sensing systems associated with multidrug resistance and biofilm formation in Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - Bacteroides fragilis constitutes 1-2% of the natural microbiota of the human digestive tract and is the predominant anaerobic opportunistic pathogen in gastrointestinal infections. Most bacteria use quorum sensing (QS) to monitor cell density in relation to other cells and their environment. In Gram-negative bacteria, the LuxRI system is common. The luxR gene encodes a transcriptional activator inducible by type I acyl-homoserine lactone autoinducers (e.g., N-[3-oxohexanoyl] homoserine lactone and hexanoyl homoserine lactone [C6-HSL]). This study investigated the presence of QS system(s) in B. fragilis. The genome of American-type culture collection strain no. ATCC25285 was searched for QS genes. The strain was grown to late exponential phase in the presence or absence of synthetic C6-HSL and C8-HSL or natural homoserine lactones from cell-free supernatants from spent growth cultures of other bacteria. Growth, susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, efflux pump gene (bmeB) expression, and biofilm formation were measured. Nine luxR and no luxI orthologues were found. C6-HSL and supernatants from Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio cholerae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa caused a significant (1) reduction in cellular density and (2) increases in expression of four putative luxR genes, bmeB3, bmeB6, bmeB7, and bmeB10, resistance to various antibiotics, which was reduced by carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP, an uncoupler that dissipates the transmembrane proton gradient, which is also the driving force of resistance nodulation division efflux pumps) and (3) increase in biofilm formation. Susceptibility of ATCC25285 to C6-HSL was also reduced by CCCP. These data suggest that (1) B. fragilis contains putative luxR orthologues, which could respond to exogenous homoserine lactones and modulate biofilm formation, bmeB efflux pump expression, and susceptibility to antibiotics, and (2) BmeB efflux pumps could transport homoserine lactones.
TI  - Involvement of capsaicin-sensitive afferent nerves and cholecystokinin 2/gastrin  receptors in gastroprotection and adaptation of gastric mucosa to Helicobacter pylori-lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is one of the virulence factors in the Helicobacter pylori (Hp)-infected stomach, but it remains unknown whether single and prolonged pretreatment with Hp-LPS can affect the course of gastric damage induced by aspirin (ASA). We compared the effects of Hp-LPS with those induced by LPSs isolated from intestinal Bacteroides fragilis, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Campylobacter jejuni applied for 4 days on acute ASA-induced gastric lesions in rats. The area of ASA-induced gastric lesions, gastric blood flow (GBF), expression of mRNA and protein of leptin and plasma leptin, gastrin, interleukin-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels were examined. Single (once) or repeated (five times) i.p. injections of Hp-LPS (1 mg/kg) or intestinal LPSs failed to produce macroscopic gastric damage and did not affect the GBF when compared with vehicle. Hp-LPS injected repeatedly suppressed the gastric acid secretion, up-regulated leptin mRNA and protein, and increased plasma leptin and gastrin levels. Hp-LPS significantly reduced the ASA-induced gastric damage and the accompanying decline in the GBF, and these effects were significantly attenuated by capsaicin denervation and selective antagonism of cholecystokinin-B (CCK2) receptors by RPR-102681 [N-(metoxy-3 phenyl) N-(N-methyl N-phenyl-carbamylmethyl) carbamoylmethyl]-3 ureido]-3 phenyl]-2 propronique] but not by loxiglumide, an antagonist of CCK1 receptors. We conclude that 1) daily application of Hp-LPS enhances gastric mucosal resistance against ASA damage due to the increase of GBF and the expression and release of leptin and gastrin exerting trophic and gastroprotective effects, and 2) this enhanced resistance to ASA damage in Hp-LPS-adapted stomach is mediated by the sensory afferents and specific CCK2/gastrin receptors.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of biapenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic.
AB  - Biapenem is a new carbapenem antibiotic with high stability to human renal dehydropeptidase I. Its in vitro activity was compared with that of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, piperacillin and gentamicin against a total of 650 recent clinical isolates. MICs were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and all isolates were tested at two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu). Biapenem inhibited 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia stuartii, Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella typhi, Shigella sonnei and Yersinia enterocolitica at < or = 2 mg/l and was as active as or two- to four-fold more active than imipenem against all these species, with the exception of Serratia marcescens, against which imipenem was two-fold more active. Biapenem was two-fold more active than imipenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 4 mg/l) and had activity similar to that of imipenem against the Bacteroides fragilis group (MIC90 0.5 mg/l) but was two-fold less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) and was, like imipenem, inactive against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - In-vitro evaluation of ampicillin/brobactam and comparison with other beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The ability of brobactam to inhibit beta-lactamases and the in vitro activity of  ampicillin combined with brobactam was compared with another beta-lactamase inhibitor, clavulanic acid, and other beta-lactam antibiotics. Both inhibitors showed good and similar activity against staphylococcal penicillinase and most broad-spectrum beta-lactamases found in the Enterobacteriaceae, whether plasmid or chromosomally mediated. Both inhibitors were less active against chromosomally mediated cephalosporinases in Enterobacteriaceae, but brobactam was 8-50 times more potent than clavulanic acid. The amount and type of beta-lactamase produced by a particular bacterial strain was reflected in its sensitivity to a combination of ampicillin and brobactam, and correlated well with the sensitivity of extracted beta-lactamase to inhibition by brobactam. The in-vitro activity of ampicillin/brobactam in a 3:1 ratio was compared to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid (4:1 ratio), amoxycillin, cefaclor and cefuroxime. The two inhibitor combinations were generally of similar activity, but the brobactam combination had superior activity against Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii and Yersinia enterocolitica. The cephalosporins were less effective against the Bacteroides fragilis group, Prot. vulgaris and M. morganii, but had advantages in the case of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and C. diversus. The MBC of ampicillin/brobactam was similar to the MIC. No resistant sub-populations were observed amongst the staphylococcal strains investigated. Exposure of bacteria to sub-inhibitory levels of ampicillin/brobactam did not lead generally to the development of resistance.
TI  - In-vitro activity of meropenem against clinical isolates obtained in Canada.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, gentamicin and, where appropriate, other antibiotics against recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. MICs were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. Meropenem inhibited 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens and Providencia stuartii at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l and was four- to 16-fold more active than imipenem against these species. Against the enteric pathogens Salmonella typhi, Shigella sonnei, Yersinia enterocolitica and Campylobacter jejuni, meropenem was four- to eight-fold more active than imipenem, inhibiting all isolates at less than or equal to 0.03 mg/l. Meropenem was also more active than imipenem against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) but had similar activity against the Bacteroides fragilis group (MIC90 0.25 mg/l), against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 2 mg/l) and against streptococci. Imipenem was four-fold more active than meropenem against Acinetobacter spp. and two- to eight-fold more active against all species of staphylococci tested. Both meropenem and imipenem were inactive against Ps. (Xanthomonas) maltophilia.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ticarcillin in the presence of clavulanate potassium.
AB  - The antibacterial effects produced by ticarcillin disodium plus clavulanate potassium, a combination of the broad-spectrum penicillin ticarcillin, and the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid as the potassium salt, have been measured in vitro and in experimental infection studies. The presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the activity of ticarcillin against a wide range of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. These included ticarcillin-resistant strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, and the anaerobe Bacteroides fragilis. In addition, beta-lactamase-producing isolates of Hemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ticarcillin and clavulanate. Clavulanic acid did not influence the activity of ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible bacteria. The bactericidal effects of the antibiotic combination were measured in an in vitro kinetic model in which the drug concentrations were varied to simulate those measured in humans after intravenous dosing with ticarcillin (3.0 g) and clavulanate potassium (100 mg clavulanic acid). In these tests, ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid had pronounced bactericidal activity against ticarcillin-resistant bacteria. The protection of ticarcillin by clavulanic acid from inactivation by bacterial beta-lactamases in vivo was demonstrated in experimental infection models in which the efficacy of the ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid combination against infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing bacteria was correlated with the presence of effective concentrations of both antibiotic and inhibitor at the site of infection.
TI  - [Demonstration of a species specific determinant of Bacteroides fragilis lipopolysaccharides using monoclonal antibodies].
AB  - The reactivity of two monoclonal antibodies to Bacteroides fragilis was tested (ELISA) with 37 strains of B. fragilis, 1 strain each of B. thetaiotaomicron, B. ovatus, B. vulgatus and B. eggerthii, 1 strain of Fusobacterium, as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6 strains), E coli (8 strains), Klebsiella (2 strains), Yersinia enterocolitica (1 strain) and LPS from Salmonella minnesota. Both monoclonal antibodies proved to be specific for B. fragilis. The determinants recognized by these antibodies are localized in the LPS of this gram-negative anaerobe.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of MT-141, a new semisynthetic cephamycin, compared with those of five cephalosporins.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of MT-141 were compared with those of cefoxitin, cefmetazole, moxalactam, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone. The MICs of MT-141 for 90% of bacterial isolates were lower than the reference drugs against clinical isolates of Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium difficile, and Bacteroides fragilis, whereas against clinical isolates of other gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, the MICs of MT-141 were similar to or higher than those of the reference drugs. In contrast, the bactericidal activity of MT-141 after 6- and 24-h exposures was superior to all of the reference drugs against 9 to 10 of the 12 bacterial strains studied, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enteritidis, indol-positive Proteus species, Serratia marcescens, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas cepacia, and Clostridium perfringens. In the treatment of systemic infections in mice, MT-141 was again superior against 9 of the 12 strains tested, showing a good correlation with the bactericidal activity. It was found that the 50% effective doses of the six cephalosporins studied correlated better with the MBCs than with the MICs. As the serum levels of MT-141 in mice after subcutaneous administration were similar to those of the reference drugs, it was concluded that the bactericidal activity of MT-141 was a dominant factor in its in vivo activity.
