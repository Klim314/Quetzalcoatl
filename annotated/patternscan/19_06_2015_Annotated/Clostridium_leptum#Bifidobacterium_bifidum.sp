TI  == impact of bifidobacterium bifidum mimbb75 on mouse intestinal microorganisms.
AB  == bifidobacterium bifidum mimbb75 is a recently identified probiotic. however, its  distribution along the intestine and impact on resident microbiota is unknown. herein, we established a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay targeting the b. bifidum-specific bopa region for the quantification of b. bifidum in feces and used this assay to investigate transit of b. bifidum mimbb75 through the murine intestine. we also analyzed the consequential impact on resident microbial cohorts. c57bl/6j mice were daily gavaged with 0.2 ml of either sterile pbs or pbs containing 10(8) colony-forming units of b. bifidum mimbb75 for 2 weeks, after which intestinal contents and fecal samples were analyzed for microbial compositional changes. bifidobacterium bifidum mimbb75 was able to transiently colonize the murine intestine, with the predominant niche being the ceco-proximal colonic region. region-specific effects on host microbiota were observed including decreased levels of clostridium coccoides in the cecum, increased levels of bifidobacteria in the proximal and distal colon, total bacteria and clostridium leptum in the proximal colon, and of c. coccoides  in the feces. these findings suggest that probiotic properties of b. bifidum mimbb75 may partially depend on its ability to at least transiently colonize the  intestine and impact on the resident microbial communities at various intestinal  loci.

TI  == introducing gut low-density array (gulda): a validated approach for qpcr-based intestinal microbial community analysis.
AB  == alterations in the human gut microbiota caused, for example, by diet, functional  foods, antibiotics, or occurring as a function of age are now known to be of relevance for host health. therefore, there is a strong need for methods to detect such alterations in a rapid and comprehensive manner. in the present study, we developed and validated a high-throughput real-time quantitative pcr-based analysis platform, termed 'gut low-density array' (gulda). the platform was designed for simultaneous analysis of the change in the abundance of 31 different microbial 16s rrna gene targets in fecal samples obtained from individuals at various points in time. the target genes represent important phyla, genera, species, or other taxonomic groups within the five predominant bacterial phyla of the gut, firmicutes, bacteroidetes, actinobacteria, proteobacteria, and verrucomicrobia and also euryarchaeota. to demonstrate the applicability of gulda, analysis of fecal samples obtained from six healthy infants at both 9 and 18 months of age was performed and showed a significant increase over time of the relative abundance of bacteria belonging to clostridial cluster iv (clostridia leptum group) and bifidobacterium bifidum and concurrent decrease in the abundance of clostridium butyricum and a tendency for decrease in enterobacteriaceae over the 9-month period.

TI  == molecular monitoring of the development of intestinal microbiota in japanese infants.
AB  == the faecal microbiota of 166 healthy japanese newborns was analysed periodically  from day 1 after birth until the age of 3 years by using the reverse transcription-quantitative pcr. faecal ph and the organic acid concentration were also examined. colonisation by both facultative anaerobes and strict anaerobes was confirmed in 95% of the meconium tested. bifidobacterium-predominant microbiota was established subsequently in most of the infants by 3 months after  birth. bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium catenulatum group and bifidobacterium bifidum were the species mainly detected. intergroup correlation analysis revealed that the bifidobacterial population levels, but not other strict anaerobe groups, were found to be negatively correlated with those of the enterobacteriaceae from 7 days until 3 months after birth. faecal ph was maintained at about 6 until 6 months after birth and reached 6.6 at 3 years after birth. the initial concentration of faecal organic acids (19 mum/g of faeces) just after birth increased until 3 years after birth to the level of 111 mum/g of faeces. early start of feeding formula milk promoted colonisation by obligate anaerobes such as the clostridium coccoides group, the clostridium leptum subgroup, prevotella, and atopobium cluster during the 3 months after birth. population levels of the bifidobacteria until 1 month after birth and those of the bacteroides fragilis group until 6 months after birth were lower in infants delivered by caesarean section than in those delivered normally. the results suggested that both earlier start of feeding of formula milk and the mode of infant delivery were found to be important in the development of intestinal microbiota in early infancy.

TI  == interplay between weight loss and gut microbiota composition in overweight adolescents.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the influence of an obesity treatment program on the gut microbiota and body weight of overweight adolescents. thirty-six adolescents (13-15 years), classified as overweight according to the international obesity task force bmi criteria, were submitted to a calorie-restricted diet (10-40%) and increased physical activity (15-23 kcal/kg body weight/week) program over 10 weeks. gut bacterial groups were analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr before and after the intervention. a group of subjects (n=23) experienced >4.0 kg weight loss and showed significant bmi (p=0.030) and bmi z-score (p=0.035) reductions after the intervention, while the other group (n=13) showed <2.0 kg weight loss. no significant differences in dietary intake were found between both groups. in the whole adolescent population, the intervention led to increased bacteroides fragilis group (p=0.001) and lactobacillus group (p=0.030) counts, and to decreased clostridium coccoides group (p=0.028), bifidobacterium longum (p=0.031), and bifidobacterium adolescentis (p=0.044) counts. in the high weight-loss group, b. fragilis group and lactobacillus group counts also increased (p=0.001 and p=0.007, respectively), whereas c. coccoides group and b. longum counts decreased (p=0.001 and p=0.044, respectively) after the intervention. total bacteria, b. fragilis group and clostridium leptum group, and bifidobacterium catenulatum group counts  were significantly higher (p<0.001-0.036) while levels of c. coccoides group, lactobacillus group, bifidobacterium, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium  bifidum were significantly lower (p<0.001-0.008) in the high weight-loss group than in the low weight-loss group before and after the intervention. these findings indicate that calorie restriction and physical activity have an impact on gut microbiota composition related to body weight loss, which also seem to be  influenced by the individual's microbiota.

TI  == genetic diversity of viable, injured, and dead fecal bacteria assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and 16s rrna gene analysis.
AB  == a novel approach combining a flow cytometric in situ viability assay with 16s rrna gene analysis was used to study the relationship between diversity and activity of the fecal microbiota. simultaneous staining with propidium iodide (pi) and syto bc provided clear discrimination between intact cells (49%), injured or damaged cells (19%), and dead cells (32%). the three subpopulations were sorted and characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of 16s rrna gene amplicons obtained from the total and bifidobacterial communities. this analysis revealed that not only the total community but also the distinct subpopulations are characteristic for each individual. cloning and sequencing of the dominant bands of the dgge patterns showed that most of clones  retrieved from the live, injured, and dead fractions belonged to clostridium coccoides, clostridium leptum, and bacteroides. we found that some of the butyrate-producing related bacteria, such as eubacterium rectale and eubacterium  hallii, were obviously viable at the time of sampling. however, amplicons affiliated with bacteroides and ruminococcus obeum- and eubacterium biforme-like  bacteria, as well as butyrivibrio crossotus, were obtained especially from the dead population. furthermore, some bacterial clones were recovered from all sorted fractions, and this was especially noticeable for the clostridium leptum cluster. the bifidobacterial phylotypes identified in total samples and sorted fractions were assigned to bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium longum,  bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, and bifidobacterium  bifidum. phylogenetic analysis of the live, dead, and injured cells revealed a remarkable physiological heterogeneity within these bacterial populations; b. longum and b. infantis were retrieved from all sorted fractions, while b. adolescentis was recovered mostly from the sorted dead fraction.
