TI  == microbial dynamics during conversion from supragingival to subgingival biofilms in an in vitro model.
AB  == the development of dental caries and periodontal diseases result from distinct shifts in the microbiota of the tooth-associated biofilm. this in vitro study aimed to investigate changes in biofilm composition and structure, during the shift from a "supragingival" aerobic to a "subgingival" anaerobic profile. biofilms consisting of actinomyces oris, candida albicans, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar were aerobically grown in saliva-containing medium on hydroxyapatite discs. after 64 h, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus anginosus were further added along with human serum, while culture conditions were shifted to microaerophilic. after 96 h, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were finally added and the biofilm was grown anaerobically for another 64 h. at the end of each phase, biofilms were harvested for species-specific quantification and localization. apart from c. albicans, all other species gradually increased during aerobic and microaerophilic conditions,  but remained steady during anaerobic conditions. biofilm thickness was doubled during the microaerophilic phase, but remained steady throughout the anaerobic phase. extracellular polysaccharide presence was gradually reduced throughout the growth period. biofilm viability was reduced during the microaerophilic conversion, but was recovered during the anaerobic phase. this in vitro study has characterized the dynamic structural shifts occurring in an oral biofilm model during the switch from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, potentially modeling the  conversion of supragingival to subgingival biofilms. within the limitations of this experimental model, the findings may provide novel insights into the ecology of oral biofilms. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == relationship between methanogenic archaea and subgingival microbial complexes in  human periodontitis.
AB  == we compared the amounts of methanogenic archaea with ten of the most important periodontal pathogens in 125 clinical samples. correlation analysis suggests that the support of the periodontitis-associated bacterial consortium by methanogenic  archaea may be driven through direct or indirect interactions with prevotella intermedia.

TI  == association between polycystic ovary syndrome, oral microbiota and systemic antibody responses.
AB  == polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos) is a hormonal disorder of women that not only is the leading cause of infertility but also shows a reciprocal link with oral health. this study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that the levels of putative periodontal pathogens in saliva and their antibody response in serum are elevated in pcos, compared to systemic health. a total of 125 women were included in four groups; 45 women with pcos and healthy periodontium, 35 women with pcos and gingivitis, 25 systemically and periodontally healthy women, 20 systemically  healthy women with gingivitis. salivary levels of seven putative periodontal pathogens were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and serum antibody levels were analyzed by elisa. in women with pcos, salivary porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis and tannerella forsythia levels were higher than matched systemically healthy women,  particularly in the case of gingivitis. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and treponema denticola levels were similar among study groups. the presence of pcos  also enhanced p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and s. oralis serum antibody levels, when gingivitis was also present. gingival inflammation correlated positively with levels of the studied taxa in saliva, particularly in pcos. the presence of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum in saliva also exhibited a strong positive correlation with the corresponding serum antibody levels. in conclusion, as an underlying systemic endocrine condition, pcos may quantitatively affect the composition of oral microbiota and the raised systemic response to selective members of this microbial community, exerting a confounding role in resultant gingival inflammation and periodontal health. the most consistent effect appeared to be exerted on p. gingivalis.

TI  == age-dependent changes in porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella species/phylotypes in healthy gingiva and inflamed/diseased sub-gingival sites.
AB  == objectives: early colonisation of oral surfaces by periodontal pathogens presents a significant risk factor for subsequent development of destructive disease affecting tissues that support the dentition. the aims of the present study were  to establish the age-dependent relationship between sub-gingival profiles of 22 prevotella species/phylotypes in children, adolescents and adults from an isolated aboriginal community and, further, to use this information to identify prevotella species that could serve as microbial risk indicators. materials and methods: dna isolated from sub-gingival plaque samples (three healthy sites and three inflamed/diseased sites) from adults, adolescents and children was screened for porphyromonas gingivalis load and 22 prevotella species/phylotypes by species-specific pcr. results: a noticeable feature in adolescents was the marked increase in colonisation by p. gingivalis across all test sites. the mean number  of prevotella species/phylotypes colonising inflamed/diseased sub-gingival sites  increased with age. progressive partitioning of selected prevotella species/phylotypes to healthy or inflamed/diseased sites was evident. prevalence  of prevotella intermedia, prevotella oral clone p4pb_24 and prevotella oris increased significantly with age in diseased sites. similarly, significant age-dependent increase in colonisation of healthy as well as inflamed/diseased sub-gingival sites was apparent for prevotella oralis, prevotella multiformis, prevotella denticola, prevotella strain p4p_53 and prevotella oral clone br014. conclusion: early colonisation of children by p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and prevotella oral clone p4pb_24 provides indication of risk for subsequent development of periodontal disease. clinical relevance: in the present study, the complexity of prevotella species within gingival sites is explored as a basis for evaluating contribution of prevotella species to disease.

TI  == molecular identification and antibiotic resistant bacteria isolated from primary  dentition infections.
AB  == background: bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a health problem in many parts of the world. the aim of this study was to identify bacteria from dental infections and determine bacterial resistance to antibiotics used in dental care  in the primary dentition. methods: this cross-sectional study comprised 60 children who presented for dental treatment for active dental infections in the primary dentition. samples from dental infections were collected and bacteria were identified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay. bacterial resistance to antibiotics was determined by colony forming units on agar plates containing amoxicillin, clindamycin and amoxillicin-clavulanic acid (a-ca) tested at 8 mug/ml or 16 mug/ml. results: clindamycin in both concentrations tested (8 mug/ml and 16 mug/ml) showed the highest bacterial resistance (85.9%), followed by amoxicillin (43.7%) and a-ca (12.0%). all comparisons among the three antibiotics used in the study exhibited statistical significance (p = <0.05) in both concentrations tested (8 mug/ml and 16 mug/ml), and under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. the most prevalent resistant species identified by pcr in primary dentition infections were: streptococcus oralis and prevotella intermedia (75.0%); treponema denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis (48.3%); streptococcus  mutans (45.0%); campylobacter rectus; and streptococcus salivarius (40%). conclusions: this study demonstrated that a-ca exhibited the lowest bacterial resistance for clinical isolates in primary dentition infections.

TI  == colonisation of gingival epithelia by subgingival biofilms in vitro: role of "red complex" bacteria.
AB  == objectives: biofilm formation on tooth surface results in colonisation and invasion of the juxtaposed gingival tissue, eliciting strong inflammatory responses that lead to periodontal disease. this in vitro study investigated the  colonisation of human gingival multi-layered epithelium by multi-species subgingival biofilms, and evaluated the relative effects of the "red complex" species (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola). methods: the grown biofilm consisted of fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, veillonella dispar, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, t. denticola, actinomyces oris, streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus oralis, or its variant lacking the "red complex". after 48h in co-culture with the gingival epithelia, the bacterial species in the biofilm were quantified, whereas their localisation on the cell surface was investigated by combining confocal-laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation  (fish), as well as by scanning electron microscopy (sem). results: exclusion of the "red complex" quantitatively affected s. oralis, but not other species. the "red-complex" species were all able to colonise the gingival epithelial cells. a  co-localisation trend was observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola, as determined by fish. however, in the absence of all three "red complex" bacteria from the biofilm, an immense colonisation of streptococci (potentially s. oralis) was observed on the gingival epithelia, as confirmed by both clsm and sem. conclusions: while the "red complex" species synergise in colonizing gingival epithelia, their absence from the biofilm enhances streptococcal colonisation. this antagonism with streptococci reveals that the "red complex" may regulate biofilm virulence, with potential implications in periodontal pathogenesis.

TI  == beta-lactamic resistance profiles in porphyromonas, prevotella, and parvimonas species isolated from acute endodontic infections.
AB  == introduction: susceptibility to beta-lactamic agents has changed among anaerobic  isolates from acute endodontic infections. the aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of the cfxa/cfxa2 gene in prevotella spp., porphyromonas spp., and parviomonas micra strains and show its phenotypic expression. methods:  root canal samples from teeth with acute endodontic infections were collected and porphyromonas, prevotella, and parvimonas micra strains were isolated and microbiologically identified with conventional culture techniques. the susceptibility of the isolates was determined by the minimum inhibitory concentration of benzylpenicillin, amoxicillin, and amoxicillin + clavulanate using the e-test method (ab biodisk, solna, sweden). the presence of the cfxa/cfxa2 gene was determined through primer-specific polymerase chain reaction. the nitrocefin test was used to determine the expression of the lactamase enzyme. results: prevotella disiens, prevotella oralis, porphyromonas gingivalis, and p.  micra strains were susceptible to benzylpenicillin, amoxicillin, and amoxicillin  + clavulanate. the cfxa/cfxa2 gene was detected in 2 of 29 isolates (6.9%). simultaneous detection of the cfxa/cfxa2 gene and lactamase production was observed for 1 prevotella buccalis strain. the gene was in 1 p. micra strain but  was not expressed. three strains were positive for lactamase production, but the  cfxa/cfxa2 gene was not detected through polymerase chain reaction. conclusions:  there is a low prevalence of the cfxa/cfxa2 gene and its expression in porphyromonas spp., prevotella spp., and p. micra strains isolated from acute endodontic infections. genetic and phenotypic screening must be performed simultaneously to best describe additional mechanisms involved in lactamic resistance for strict anaerobes.

TI  == impact of early colonizers on in vitro subgingival biofilm formation.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of early colonizing species on the structure and the composition of the bacterial community developing in a subgingival 10-species biofilm model system. the model included streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, actinomycesoris, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp.  nucleatum, veillonella dispar, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. based on literature, we considered streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, and actinomyces oris as early colonizers and examined their role in the biofilms by either a delayed addition to the consortium, or by not inoculating at all the biofilms with these species. we quantitatively evaluated the resulting biofilms by real-time quantitative pcr and further compared the structures using confocal  laser scanning microscopy following fluorescence in situ hybridisation. the absence of the early colonizers did not hinder biofilm formation. the biofilms reached the same total counts and developed to normal thickness. however, quantitative shifts in the abundances of individual species were observed. in the absence of streptococci, the overall biofilm structure appeared looser and more dispersed. moreover, besides a significant increase of p. intermedia and a decrease of p. gingivalis , p. intermedia appeared to form filamented long chains that resembled streptococci. a. oris, although growing to significantly higher abundance in absence of streptococci, did not have a visible impact on the biofilms. hence, in the absence of the early colonizers, there is a pronounced effect on p. intermedia and p. gingivalis that may cause distinct shifts in the structure of the biofilm. streptococci possibly facilitate the establishment of p. gingivalis into subgingival biofilms, while in their absence p. intermedia became more dominant and forms elongated chains.

TI  == validation of a quantitative real-time pcr assay and comparison with fluorescence microscopy and selective agar plate counting for species-specific quantification  of an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  == background and objective: subgingival biofilms are the prime etiological factor of periodontal disease. owing to their complex polymicrobial nature, quantification of individual bacterial species within the biofilm for research and diagnostic purposes can be methodologically challenging. the aims of this study were to establish a quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) assay to quantify the bacteria used in our 10-species in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm model and to compare the quantitative outcome with fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming  unit (cfu) counts on selective agar plates. material and methods: the 10 species  included in the in vitro biofilm were streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, actinomyces oris, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. the numbers of each species were quantified at two time points using qpcr, microscopy counting following fluorescence in-situ hybridization (fish) or immunofluorescence staining, and counting of cfus after growth on selective agar plates. results: all 10 species were successfully quantified using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, and the eight species culturable on selective agar plates were also quantified by counting the numbers  of cfus after growth on selective agar. in early biofilm cultures, all methods showed a significant correlation, although the absolute numbers differed between  methods. in late biofilm cultures, measurements obtained using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, but not by cfu counts, maintained significant correlation. cfu counts yielded lower values than did measurements made using the other two methods. conclusion: quantitative pcr and epifluorescence microscopy can be easily combined with each other to determine species-specific bacterial numbers within biofilms. however, conventional bacterial cultures cannot be as efficiently combined using these molecular detection methods. this may be crucial in designing and selecting appropriate clinical diagnostic methods for subgingival biofilm samples.

TI  == antibacterial effects of blackberry extract target periodontopathogens.
AB  == background and objective: antimicrobial agents provide valuable adjunctive therapy for the prevention and the control of oral diseases. limitations in their prolonged use have stimulated the search for new, naturally occurring agents with more specific activity and fewer adverse effects. here we sought to determine the antibacterial properties of blackberry extract (bbe) in vitro against oral bacterial commensals and periodontopathogens. material and methods: the effects of whole and fractionated bbe on the metabolism of 10 different oral bacteria were evaluated using the colorimetric water-soluble tetrazolium-1 assay. the bactericidal effects of whole bbe against fusobacterium nucleatum were determined by quantitating the numbers of colony-forming units (cfus). cytotoxicity was determined in oral epithelial (okf6) cells. results: bbe at 350-1400 mug/ml reduced the metabolic activity of porphyromonas gingivalis, f. nucleatum and streptococcus mutans. the reduced metabolic activity observed for f. nucleatum corresponded to a reduction in the numbers of cfus following exposure to bbe for  as little as 1 h, indicative of its bactericidal properties. an anthocyanin-enriched fraction of bbe reduced the metabolic activity of f. nucleatum, but not of p. gingivalis or s. mutans, suggesting the contribution of  species-specific agents in the whole bbe. oral epithelial cell viability was not  reduced following exposure to whole bbe (2.24-1400 mug/ml) for </= 6 h. conclusion: bbe alters the metabolic activity of oral periodontopathogens while demonstrating a minimal effect on commensals. the specific antibacterial properties of bbe shown in this study, along with its previously demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, make this natural extract a promising target as an adjunct for prevention and/or complementary therapy of periodontal infections.

TI  == impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (rp) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [gr]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. methods: individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or >3 sites with al >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as gr (n  = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >/=2.5 mm after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after  treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim analysis. significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the wilcoxon test. results: the majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. species that increased or persisted in high frequency in  rp but were significantly reduced in gr included bacteroidetes sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, dialister spp., selenomonas spp., catonella morbi, eubacterium spp., filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus sp. ot113, fusobacterium sp. ot203,  pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, streptococcus intermedius or streptococcus constellatus, and shuttlesworthia satelles. in contrast, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, gemella haemolysans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, kingella oralis, lautropia mirabilis, neisseria elongata, rothia  dentocariosa, streptococcus australis, and veillonella spp. were more associated  with therapeutic success. conclusion: persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

TI  == characterization of the porphyromonas gingivalis conjugative transposon ctnpg1: determination of the integration site and the genes essential for conjugal transfer.
AB  == in our previous study, extensive genomic rearrangements were found in two strains of the gram-negative anaerobic bacterium porphyromonas (por.) gingivalis, and most of these rearrangements were associated with mobile genetic elements such as insertion sequences and conjugative transposons (ctns). ctnpg1, identified in por. gingivalis strain atcc 33277, was the first complete ctn reported for the genus porphyromonas. in the present study, we found that ctnpg1 can be transferred from strain atcc 33277 to another por. gingivalis strain, w83, at a frequency of 10(-7) to 10(-6). the excision of ctnpg1 from the chromosome in a donor cell depends on an integrase (int; pgn_0094) encoded in ctnpg1, whereas ctnpg1 excision is independent of pgn_0084 (a dna topoisomerase i homologue; exc) encoded within ctnpg1 and reca (pgn_1057) on the donor chromosome. intriguingly,  however, the transfer of ctnpg1 between por. gingivalis strains requires reca function in the recipient. sequencing analysis of ctnpg1-integrated sites on the  chromosomes of transconjugants revealed that the consensus attachment (att) sequence is a 13 bp sequence, ttttcnnnnaaaa. we further report that ctnpg1 is able to transfer to two other bacterial species, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and prevotella oralis. in addition, ctnpg1-like ctns are located in the genomes of other oral anaerobic bacteria, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella buccae and  prevotella intermedia, with the same consensus att sequence. these results suggest that ctns in the ctnpg1 family are widely distributed among oral anaerobic gram-negative bacteria found in humans and play important roles in horizontal gene transfer among these bacteria.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == surgical endodontic treatment of refractory periapical periodontitis with extraradicular biofilm.
AB  == objective: this study explored the effect of surgical endodontic treatment of refractory periapical periodontitis with extraradicular biofilm. study design: endodontic surgery was conducted on a case of refractory periapical periodontitis with extraradicular biofilm. during the procedure, the samples of periapical tissues were collected for microbiologic analysis. the resected root ends were observed under scanning electron microscope. the patient was recalled every 3 months to evaluate the treatment effect for 1 year. results: the samples yielded  1 type of facultative anaerobic bacteria (streptococcus sanguis) and 2 types of obligate anaerobic bacteria (porphynomonas endodontalis and prevotella oralis). mature bacteria biofilms were formed on the surface of the root apexes. at the 1-year recall visit, the radiograph and the clinic examination showed the refractory periapical periodontitis was cured successfully. conclusions: the periapical bacterial biofilm may contribute to the refractory periapical periodontitis. endodontic surgery is a good option for definitive removal of an established extraradicular infection.

TI  == profiling of subgingival plaque biofilm microflora from periodontally healthy subjects and from subjects with periodontitis using quantitative real-time pcr.
AB  == background and objective: qualitative and quantitative changes of the subgingival plaque biofilm microflora in periodontal pockets are thought to be associated with the development and progression of periodontitis. the aims of the present study were to quantify the proportions of nine periodontitis-associated bacterial species and four streptococcus species in subgingival plaque, and to evaluate their relationship with periodontitis quantitatively. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 12 periodontally healthy subjects and from 28 patients with periodontitis. the amounts of total and target bacteria were measured by quantitative real-time pcr using universal and species-specific  primers, respectively. results: the proportion of total obligate anaerobes was found to be higher in subjects with periodontitis than in periodontally healthy subjects (p < 0.05). among obligate anaerobes, tannerella forsythia (2.04 +/- 5.27%, p < 0.05), porphyromonas gingivalis (0.54 +/- 1.41%) and eubacterium saphenum (0.30 +/- 0.96%) were detected at high proportions in subjects with periodontitis, but not in periodontally healthy subjects. by contrast, the proportion of total streptococci was lower in subjects with periodontitis (p < 0.05). specifically, the proportion of t. forsythia, p. gingivalis or e. saphenum increased (>or= 2.78%) and the proportion of streptococcus species decreased to virtually undetectable levels, in subjects with periodontitis. conclusion: obligate anaerobes, including t. forthysia, p. gingivalis and e. saphenum, were identified predominantly in microflora from subjects with periodontitis, whereas  streptococcus species were identified predominantly in microflora from periodontally healthy subjects, suggesting a change in the subgingival environment that resulted in conditions more suitable for the survival of obligate anaerobes. the proportion of these obligate anaerobes in the subgingival plaque of subjects with periodontitis appears to be associated with the status of human periodontitis.

TI  == t-rflp-based mcra gene analysis of methanogenic archaea in association with oral  infections and evidence of a novel methanobrevibacter phylotype.
AB  == introduction: increasing evidence suggests a role for methanogenic archaea (methanogens) in human health and disease via syntrophic interactions with bacteria. here we assessed the prevalence and distribution of methanogens and possible associations with bacteria in oral biofilms. methods: forty-four periodontal and 32 endodontic samples from necrotic teeth with radiographic evidence of apical periodontitis were analysed. terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis based on the mcra gene, specific to methanogens, was applied. the prevalence and amounts of methanogens in endodontic samples were compared with those of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, treponema spp. and synergistes spp. based on real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactions. results: besides dominance of the mcra gene corresponding to methanobrevibacter oralis, one mcra gene type, for which no cultivated member has been reported previously, was identified in five periodontal samples and one endodontic sample. rates of non-synonymous vs. synonymous nucleotide substitutions suggest that this mcra gene type codes for a  functionally active methyl-coenzyme m reductase. methanobrevibacter smithii, the  prominent methanogen in the human gut system, was not detected. mean proportions  of methanogens were comparable to synergistes spp. ranging from 0.5 to 1.0% of the total microbial community. treponema spp. dominated with a mean proportion of 10%, while the mean proportions of the other endodontic pathogens were below 0.1%. a positive association between methanogens and synergistes spp. was found.  conclusion: our data provide evidence of a novel, as yet uncultured methanogenic  phylotype in association with oral infections, and indicate possible interactions between methanogens and synergistes spp., the nature of which deserves further investigation.

TI  == the microbiota on different oral surfaces in healthy children.
AB  == introduction: knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. methods: microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the dental school of the university of athens, who were split into three age groups. a total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: all of the test species, except parvimonas micra and porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial  profiles for the different oral surfaces. supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of actinomyces species and  green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the yellow complex. the profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. specifically, the red complex species (tannerella forsythia, p. gingivalis, treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (p < 0.05) in all sample locations. conclusions: the results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of orange and red  complex species.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

AB  == background and objective: oral epithelial cells may be invaded by a polymicrobial intracellular flora, including pathogens together with commensals. various oral pathogens can induce the production of interleukin-8, a potent neutrophil chemotractant, in oral epithelial cells. evidence from the gut suggests that commensal species may modulate inflammatory responses to pathogens. the aim of this study was to examine the interleukin-8 responses of oral epithelial cells to an oral pro-inflammatory species, fusobacterium nucleatum, in combination with an oral commensal, streptococcus cristatus. material and methods: kb, tert-2, tr146  and scc15 cells were cocultured with f. nucleatum and s. cristatus, either alone  or in combination, at 37 degrees c in 5% co2 under various conditions. the mrna expression of interleukin-8 was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay. results: f. nucleatum alone evoked a potent interleukin-8 response, whereas s. cristatus alone did not induce significant interleukin-8 expression in oral epithelial cells. when present together, s. cristatus attenuated the f. nucleatum-induced interleukin-8 production in the four oral epithelial cell lines to varying degrees. the inhibitory effect of s. cristatus was independent of its  viability and its co-aggregation with f. nucleatum, was not related to soluble bacterial products and appeared to require bacterial contact with epithelial cells. similar effects were seen with several other species of oral streptococci. conclusion: our data suggest that s. cristatus may exert immunomodulatory effects on the interleukin-8 response of oral epithelial cells to f. nucleatum challenge.

TI  == bacterial and candida albicans adhesion on rapid prototyping-produced 3d-scaffolds manufactured as bone replacement materials.
AB  == rapid prototyping (rp)-produced scaffolds are gaining increasing importance in scaffold-guided tissue engineering. microbial adhesion on the surface of replacement materials has a strong influence on healing and long-term outcome. consequently, it is important to examine the adherence of microorganisms on rp-produced scaffolds. this research focussed on manufacturing of scaffolds by 3d-bioplotting and examination of their microbial adhesion characteristics. tricalciumphosphate (tcp), calcium/sodium alginate, and poly(lactide-co-glycolic  acid) (plga) constructs were produced and used to study the adhesion of dental pathogens. six oral bacterial strains, one candida strain and human saliva were used for the adhesion studies. the number of colony forming units (cfu) were determined and scanning electron microscopy (sem) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) were performed. microorganisms adhered to all scaffolds. all strains, except for streptococcus oralis, adhered best to plga scaffolds. streptococcus oralis adhered to each of the biomaterials equally. streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis adhered best to plga scaffolds, followed by alginate and tcp. prevotella nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus  sanguis, and candida albicans showed the highest adherence to plga, followed by tcp and alginate. in contrast, the microorganisms of saliva adhered significantly better to tcp, followed by plga and alginate. sem observations correlated with the results of the cfu determinations. clsm detected bacteria within deeper sheets of alginate. in conclusion, because of the high adherence rate of oral pathogens to the scaffolds, the application of these biomaterials for bone replacement in oral surgery could result in biomaterial-related infections. strategies to decrease microbial adherence and to prevent infections due to oral  pathogens are discussed.

TI  == microflora in oral ecosystems in subjects with radiation-induced hyposalivation.
AB  == aim: to analyse the microbial flora in specific oral sites in 13 dentate subjects, 6-8 months after completed radiation therapy (rt group) and in 13 matched controls. material and methods: the microflora on the tongue, buccal mucosa, vestibulum, supragingival plaque and subgingival region was analysed using duplicate sampling and cultivation technique. a clinical examination was also performed. results: candida albicans was found in one or more sites in 54% of the rt subjects and in 15% of the controls. in three rt subjects, c. albicans  was found at all four sites analysed. an unexpected finding was that enterococci  were found in all rt subjects and in high number in 38%. none of the controls harboured enterococci. in supragingival plaque, lactobacillus spp. were detected  in 92% of the rt subjects and the number and proportion of lactobacillus spp. were extremely high compared with the controls. mutans streptococci were detected in high numbers in 31% of the rt subjects, while they were not detected in 23%. conclusion: the microbial results explain why some rt subjects have an increased  susceptibility to oral diseases and stress that site-specific microbial analysis  is an important diagnostic tool when planning oral health preventive care for rt  subjects.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis samples from different geographical origins against certain oral pathogens.
AB  == propolis is an agent having antimicrobial properties, however, its composition can vary depending on the area where it is collected. in the present study, the antimicrobial activity of five propolis samples, collected from four different regions in turkey and from brazil, against nine anaerobic strains was evaluated.  ethanol extracts of propolis (eep) were prepared from propolis samples and we determined minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) of eep on the growth of test microorganisms by using agar dilution method. all strains were susceptible and mic values ranged from 4 to 512 microg/ml for propolis activity. propolis from kazan-ankara showed most effective mic values to the studied microorganisms. mbc values of kazan-ankara eep samples  were ranged from 8 to 512 microg/ml. death was observed within 4 h of incubation  for peptostreptococcus anaerobius and micros and lactobacillus acidophilus and actinomyces naeslundii, while 8 h for prevotella oralis and prevotella melaninogenica and porphyromonas gingivalis, 12 h for fusobacterium nucleatum, 16 h for veillonella parvula. it was shown that propolis samples were more effective against gram positive anaerobic bacteria than gram negative ones. the organic chemical compositions of eeps were determined by high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (gc-ms). the main compounds of eeps were flavonoids such as pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine, chrysin and aromatic acids such as cafeic acid. because of increased antimicrobial resistance, propolis may be kept in mind in the treatment of oral cavity diseases.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal species in symptomatic and asymptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  == phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal 16s rrna was used to examine polymicrobial communities within infected root canals of 20 symptomatic and 14 asymptomatic patients. nucleotide sequences from approximately 750 clones amplified from each patient group with universal bacterial primers were matched to the ribosomal database project ii database. phylotypes from 37 genera representing actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, firmicutes, fusobacteria and proteobacteria were identified. results were compared to those obtained with species-specific primers designed to detect prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas  gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus sp., streptococcus sp., fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythensis and treponema denticola. since members of the domain archaea have been implicated in  the severity of periodontal disease, and a recent report confirms that archaea are present in endodontic infections, 16s archaeal primers were also used to detect which patients carried these prokaryotes, to determine if their presence correlated with severity of the clinical symptoms. a methanobrevibacter oralis-like species was detected in one asymptomatic and one symptomatic patient. dna from root canals of these two patients was further analysed using species-specific primers to determine bacterial cohabitants. trep. denticola was  detected in the asymptomatic but not the symptomatic patient. conversely, porph.  endodontalis was found in the symptomatic but not the asymptomatic patient. all other species except enterococci were detected with the species-specific primers  in both patients. these results confirm the presence of archaea in root canals and provide additional insights into the polymicrobial communities in endodontic  infections associated with clinical symptoms.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial efficacy of a new chlorhexidine slow-release device.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial effect of chlorhexidine and calcium hydroxide slow-release devices on oral bacteria. method and materials: the agar diffusion test was used to evaluate the  antibacterial effect of the slow-release devices activ point (chlorhexidine; roeko) and calcium hydroxide plus point (roeko) on 8 anaerobic and 2 facultative  oral bacterial strains, as well as 2 bacterial cultures randomly sampled from necrotic root canals and incubated in anaerobic and aerobic broth for 48 hours. the efficiency of the medicaments against the various strains was evaluated using a nonparametric test (friedman type) and a second nonparametric test (wilcoxon's  signed rank test). results: activ point produced significantly larger inhibition  zones (p < .001) than the calcium hydroxide slow-release device around all tested bacterial strains. conclusion: the chlorhexidine slow-release device (activ point) exhibited significant antibacterial activity in the agar diffusion test and merits study as an intracanal medicament.

TI  == identification of oral bacteria associated with crevicular epithelial cells from  chronic periodontitis lesions.
AB  == bacterial invasion of host epithelial cells plays an important role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases; however, the interactions between subgingival species and the gingival crevice cells are not fully understood. this study determined the prevalence of a group of oral bacterial species on or in epithelial cells derived from periodontal pockets and the gingival crevice of subjects with periodontitis. samples of epithelial cells were obtained from 120 sites with periodontal pockets > or =4 mm and 92 periodontally healthy sites from 49 patients (mean age 46.3+/-1.4 years; 43% males) with chronic periodontitis. bacteria in or on epithelial cells were separated from unattached bacteria by percoll density-gradient centrifugation. the presence and levels of 33 oral species were determined in epithelial cell samples by whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard method. the most frequently detected species were porphyromonas gingivalis (42%), treponema denticola (38%), prevotella intermedia  (37%), streptococcus intermedius (36%), campylobacter rectus (35%), streptococcus sanguinis (35%) and streptococcus oralis (34%). species of actinomyces were found in low prevalence and levels. the data indicated that there were more micro-organisms on or in epithelial cells obtained from periodontal pockets than  from healthy sulci; however, no significant differences regarding the percentage  and level of any specific species were found between these sites. veillonella parvula, s. oralis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mitis tended to be more prevalent in sites without disease. these findings demonstrated that a wide  range of oral species may be detected on or in crevicular epithelial cells from sites with periodontitis and from periodontally healthy sulci.

TI  == fiber optic fluorescence microprobe for endodontic diagnosis.
AB  == successful endodontic therapy requires total debridement as well as complete obturation of the root canal to the cemento-dentinal junction. the goal of this study was to investigate the feasibility of using quantitative fluorescence spectroscopy for the detection and localization of pathological dentin, pulpal remnants, and microorganisms within the root canal. specific aims were to identify: 1) characteristic excitation/emission spectra for healthy dentin, decayed dentin, enamel, and pulp; 2) the potential of specific spectral data for  differentiating between these tissues; and 3) the potential of spectral data for  detecting the presence and identifying four common endodontic pathogens. fluorescence spectra were determined in the tissues of permanent human teeth, extirpated healthy and necrotic pulps, and four endodontic pathogens. excitation/emission spectra were collected at 366 nm, 405 nm, and 440 nm excitation. marked differences in spectral signatures between the different tissues under investigation were observed. we postulate that the differences in fluorescence spectra of decayed vs. healthy dentin are due to the loss of mineralized tissue components and increased organic presence and water in these tissues. pulpal tissue showed distinctly different fluorescence spectra from healthy and decayed dentin, providing a basis for differentiating between tissue  categories. each bacterial species demonstrated distinct spectral emission patterns.

TI  == selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. methods: a gradient plate technique was used to expose fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, neisseria subflava, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii,  prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations  of triclosan. escherichia coli atcc 8739 was included as an organism showing the  triclosan resistance development trait. mic values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. results: n. subflava, pr. nigrescens po. gingivalis and e. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (mic range 0.1-3.9 mg/l), whereas the lactobacillus and  s. mutans were less susceptible (mic range 15.6-20.8 mg/l). triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (p < 0.01) for the positive control e. coli, although its mics towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (mic) occurred for pr. nigrescens and in s. sanguis and s. oralis (mbc). mean changes in susceptibilities (mic and mbc) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine mbcs for s. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. conclusions: these data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for e. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than fabi that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.

TI  == distribution of selected bacterial species on intraoral surfaces.
AB  == background/aim: to examine the proportions of 40 bacterial species in samples from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces and saliva in systemically healthy adult subjects and to compare these microbiotas with those of supra- and subgingival plaque. methods: microbial samples were taken from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces of 225 systemically healthy subjects using a "buccal brush". saliva was taken by expectoration. forty-four of these subjects provided additional supra- and subgingival plaque samples. samples were individually evaluated for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage  of total dna probe count was determined for each species, at each sample location and averaged across subjects. the significance of differences among the proportions of the 40 test species at different sample locations was sought in the 225 and 44 subjects separately using the quade test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. cluster analysis was performed using the proportions of the 40 species at the different sample locations using the minimum similarity coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. the proportions of each species were averaged across subjects in the resulting cluster groups and the significance of differences was tested using the t-test and anova. results: microbial profiles differed markedly among sample locations in the 225 subjects,  with 34 of 40 species differing significantly. proportions of veillonella parvula and prevotella melaninogenica were higher in saliva and on the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the tongue, while streptococcus mitis and s. oralis were in significantly lower proportions in saliva and on the tongue dorsum. cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 2 clusters with >85% similarity. cluster 1  comprised saliva, lateral and dorsal tongue surfaces, while cluster 2 comprised the remaining soft tissue locations. v. parvula, p. melaninogenica, eikenella corrodens, neisseria mucosa, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium periodonticum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii and porphyromonas gingivalis were in significantly higher proportions in cluster 1 and s. mitis, s. oralis and s. noxia were significantly higher in cluster 2. these findings were confirmed using data from the 44 subjects providing plaque samples. the microbial profiles of supra- and subgingival plaque differed from the other sample locations, particularly in the increased proportions of the actinomyces species. species of  different genera exhibited different proportions on the various intraoral surfaces, but even within the genus streptococcus, there were differences in colonization patterns. s. oralis, s. mitis and s. constellatus colonized the soft tissues and saliva in higher proportions than the samples from the teeth, while the other 4 streptococcal species examined colonized the dental surfaces in proportions comparable to the soft tissue locations and saliva. conclusions: proportions of bacterial species differed markedly on different intraoral surfaces. the microbiota of saliva was most similar to that of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue. the microbiotas of the soft tissues resembled each other more than the microbiotas that colonized the teeth both above and below the gingival margin.

TI  == subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.
AB  == little information is available on the effect of miswak use on gingival microbiota. we assessed levels of 28 oral bacteria in subgingival plaque of adult sudanese miswak (n = 38) and toothbrush users (n = 36) age range 20-53 years (mean 34.6 years) to study associations between these bacteria, oral hygiene method, and periodontal status at the sampled sites. a pooled subgingival plaque  sample from 6 probing sites of 1 selected tooth in each jaw was obtained from each subject. whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization were used in assessing 74 pooled samples. using 10(5) bacterial cells threshold,  between 2.6% and 47.4% of miswak users and between 2.8% and 36.1% of toothbrush users harbored the investigated species. the percentages of subjects with the investigated species at 10(6) bacterial cells varied between 2.6% and 39.5% in miswak and between 2.8% and 36.1% in toothbrush users. miswak users harbored significantly higher streptococcus intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, veillonella parvula, actinomyces israelii, and capnocytophaga gingivalis, and significantly lower selenomonas sputigena, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, and streptococcus oralis than did toothbrush users. probing pocket depth > or = 6 mm showed significantly (p <  0.05) higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and v. parvula than those 4-5 mm. our results indicate that the type of oral hygiene had a significant effect on levels of 11 out of 28 bacterial species, and that the type of effect was also dependent on type of bacteria and probing pocket depth.

TI  == effects of glucose and fluoride on competition and metabolism within in vitro dental bacterial communities and biofilms.
AB  == antimicrobial effects of fluoride in vivo remain contentious. previous studies suggested that 1 mm naf reduced acid production from glucose, and prevented the enrichment of bacteria associated with caries in a chemostat model. the present study examines the effects of a lower fluoride concentration (0.53 mm, 10 ppm naf) in both biofilm and planktonic microbial communities. nine oral species were grown at ph 7.0 and pulsed on 10 successive days with glucose; bacterial metabolism was allowed to reduce the ph for 6 h before being returned to neutrality, either in the presence or absence of naf. in addition, 10-day-old mixed culture biofilms were overlaid with glucose, with or without naf, and the ph change followed by microelectrode. after 10 days, chemostat ph dropped to ca.  ph 4.5 following glucose pulses, and the community was dominated by streptococcus mutans (rising from 4 to 23% of total cfu) and veillonella dispar (16 to 73%). in comparison, after 10 days pulsing with glucose + fluoride, the final ph was significantly higher (ca. ph 4.9) (paired t test, p < 0.0001). the culture was predominated by v. dispar (70%) and actinomyces naeslundii (13%), whereas s. mutans proportions were significantly lower (t test, p = 0.04), remaining <3% of  the total flora, compared to the culture without fluoride. biofilm ph fell to only ph 5.55 1 h after glucose/fluoride overlay, compared to 4.55 with glucose alone (paired t test, p < 0.000001). analysis of the data suggests that fluoride  exerts dual antimicrobial modes of action. fluoride prevents enrichment of s. mutans by inhibiting critical metabolic processes (direct effect) and, in an inter-related way, by reducing environmental acidification (indirect effect) in biofilms.

TI  == clinical and microbiological studies of periodontal disease in sjogren syndrome patients.
AB  == background: little is known about the periodontal status of patients with sjogren's syndrome (ss), a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized  by xerophthalmia and xerostomia. the aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the periodontal status of ss patients, in terms of clinical and microbiological parameters, differs from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls. methods: 8 primary ss and 10 secondary ss patients were  examined in comparison with 11 control subjects. all patients were diagnosed by the european community criteria. control subjects were systemically healthy and not undergoing periodontal treatment. the comparison of clinical status was made  in terms of mean periodontal parameters (plaque index, gingival index, gingival recession, probing pocket depth, probing attachment level and bleeding on probing) as well as the frequency distribution of probing pocket depth and probing attachment level measurements. microbiological assays of the subgingival  dental plaque samples were carried out by both a chairside enzyme test (periocheck) for the detection of peptidase activity (pa) and a polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) analysis for 9 selected periodontal micro-organisms (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, streptococcus oralis). results: the  occurrence, severity and extent of periodontal lesions were not significantly different between the 3 patient groups for all periodontal parameters examined. no significant differences in the sub-gingival plaque samples from control, primary or secondary ss patients for the pa test, frequency or type of periodontal micro-organisms observed. conclusion: no significant differences could be detected in either clinical or microbiological parameters of primary or  secondary ss patients compared with that of control subjects. the results of the  present study thus support the notion that the periodontal status of patients with ss do not differ from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls.

AB  == objectives: the objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the activity of the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (ast) in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) using the colorimetric periogard (ptm) test and the subgingival microflora in early onset periodontitis lesions. material and methods: the study population consisted of 25 otherwise healthy individuals exhibiting early onset periodontitis (eop). in each patient four experimental sites were identified comprising one deep periodontal pocket (pd >5 mm) randomly  chosen in each quadrant. bacterial samples were obtained from the experimental sites, consecutively cultured anaerobically and in 10% co(2) using selective and  nonselective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional  biochemical tests and various identification kits. clinical measurements as well  as ast activity, assessed either as positive or negative using the ptm, were recorded at the same sites. results: sixty-two sites exhibited ast positive and 38 ast negative activity. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann whitney u-test) showed that streptococcus intermedius, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides forsythus, camplobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus and selenomonas sputigena were significantly higher in sites with ast-positive activity. the odds ratio of having high prevalence of s. intermedius, p. micros, c. concisus, b. forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus and s.  sputigena in the presence of a positive ast site was very high (range: 3.5-17.0). streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, gemella morbillorum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium varium, eubacterium lentum and prevotella oralis were detected in significantly higher proportions in sites with ast negative activity and manifested a negative odds ratio in the presence of ast positive sites. the logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking and bleeding upon probing showed a significant association with ast activity, while plaque and suppuration were not found to be significant predictors of ast activity. the co-infection of porphyromonas gingivalis, b. forsythus and p. micros, or p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and c. rectus were found  to be significantly associated with the ast activity (p<0.001). ast positive sites revealed significantly higher occurrence of co-infections by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. sputigena or by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. intermedius than ast negative sites (p<0.001). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. naeslundii co-infection was found significantly higher in the ast negative sites (p<0.001).  conclusions: the present study found a high level of agreement between the presence of putative periodontal pathogens and positive ast scores at periodontal sites that clinically were considered to be potentially disease active. prospective studies should be performed to confirm the findings.

AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

AB  == aim: to analyse the microflora of subgingival plaque from patients with papillon-lefevre syndrome (pls), which is a very rare disease characterised by palmar-plantar hyperkeratosis with precocious periodontal destruction. methods: bacterial isolates were identified using a combination of commercial identification kits, traditional laboratory tests, and gas liquid chromatography. some isolates were also subjected to partial 16s rdna sequencing. plaque samples  were also assayed for the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in a quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) using monoclonal antibodies. results: the culture results showed that most isolates were capnophilic and facultatively anaerobic species-mainly capnocytophaga spp and streptococcus spp. the latter included s. constellatus, s. oralis, and s. sanguis. other facultative bacteria belonged to the genera gemella, kingella, leuconostoc, and stomatococcus. the aerobic bacteria isolated were species of neisseria and bacillus. anaerobic species included prevotella intermedia, p. melaninogenica, and p. nigrescens, as  well as peptostreptococcus spp. elisa detected p gingivalis in one patient in all sites sampled, whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only one site from the other patient. prevotella intermedia was present in low numbers. conclusions: patients with pls have a very complex subgingival flora including recognised periodontal pathogens. however, no particular periodontopathogen is invariably associated with pls.

AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of systemic ornidazole (orn) in sites with or without subgingival debridement in early-onset periodontitis (eop) patients. methods: two pooled bacterial samples consisting of 4 sites each (scaled and non-scaled sites) were obtained from 30 individuals exhibiting eop. all patients received oral hygiene instruction (ohi), supragingival scaling and orn. subgingival scaling and root planing (srp) was carried out only in scaled sites. bacterial samples were taken at baseline (bl) and 1 week and 2, 6, and 12 months after systemic ornidazole administration (500 mg/bid for 7 days). one more sample was taken at scaled sites, one week after srp. results: one week following srp (scaled sites)  gram-negative facultative and anaerobic rods were significantly reduced while gram-positive facultative cocci were significantly increased. after orn administration, p. gingivalis, p. denticola, p. intermedia, b. forsythus, c. rectus, and s. sputigena were no longer detectable in either scaled or non-scaled sites. a statistically significant long-term (2, 6, and 12 months) reduction of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. loescheii, b. forsythus, and c. rectus and a pronounced increase of s. milleri, s. oralis, and s. sanguis counts in both scaled and non-scaled sites were detected in comparison to baseline. a sustained  reduction of bleeding tendency and of probing depth was also observed in both scaled and non-scaled sites. conclusions: orn combined with srp effects beneficial shifts in the bacterial population associated with substantial clinical improvement, thereby indicating that orn is effective adjunct in the treatment of eop deep periodontal pockets where anaerobic bacteria are predominant.

AB  == background, aims: between 4 and 8% of periodontitis patients are reported to respond poorly to conventional therapy. in these cases, adjunctive use of systemic antibiotics might be a reasonable therapeutic approach. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of systemic amoxicillin/clavulanate as adjunct to periodontal surgery on the predominant subgingival microorganisms in patients not responding to mechanical therapy. furthermore, the bacterial susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanate was analyzed before and after therapy in order to assess the clinical validity of pre-therapeutic susceptibility testing. methods: in 10 periodontitis subjects with no subgingival detection of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, the predominant subgingival organisms were  identified using the identification system rapid id 32 a as well as antibiotic susceptibility was tested utilizing the e test. results: porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella oralis were detected in 7/10 subjects and could no more recovered  after therapy. fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus micros were present in 5/10 patients before treatment, but could be detected in 6/10, resp. 3/10 after therapy. in 4/10 subjects harboring f. nucleatum and in 3/10 with p. micros, those organisms were not targeted by amoxicillin/clavulanate, although post-treatment testing revealed their alleged susceptibility (mics varied from 0.023 to 0.032 microg/ml, resp. from 0.125 to 2.0 microg/ ml). conclusions: the results of this study suggest that the outcomes of conventional methods of susceptibility testing have to be interpreted very carefully when being used for  treatment of plaque-related diseases. furthermore, since the endpoint of systemic antibiotic treatment as adjunct to conventional therapy is elimination of f. nucleatum or p. micros in patients harboring these organisms, the use of amoxicillin/clavulanate appears not to be justified.

TI  == the formation of mixed culture biofilms of oral species along a gradient of shear stress.
AB  == a chemostat mixed culture system was used to produce two distinct ecological states, state-1 (caries-like microcosm) and state-2 (periodontal-like microcosm). eleven bacterial species (streptococcus gordonii, strep. mitis i, strep. mutans,  strep. oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, neisseria subflava, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, veillonella dispar) were used to inoculate the planktonic system. a flow cell, designed to produce convergent flow with increasing shear stress, was attached to the chemostat system, and the resultant biofilms developed from the state-1 and state-2 microcosms along the shear stress gradient were examined and compared using image analysis and viable counts. the biofilm produced from state-1 showed  a lower shear stress tolerance (0.146 pa) than the state-2 biofilm (0.236 pa). the biofilm compositions did not vary along the gradient of shear stress and were dependent on the initial inoculum conditions. gram-positive species were predominant in the state-1 biofilm, while gram-negative species were predominant  in state-2.

TI  == characterization of bacterial orofacial infections using a new murine model.
AB  == we devised a new murine orofacial infection model using bacteria from odontogenic infection origins and characterized the experimental infections. in this model, bacteria were injected into the submandible of mice. streptococcus constellatus and peptostreptococcus micros produced a single abscess at the injection site and their abscess-forming and lethal abilities were low: the median abscess-forming dose (af(50)) of s. constellatus and p. micros were 10(8.5-10.7)and 10(10.2-10.6)cfu/mouse, and their median lethal dose (ld(50)) were >11 and 10(10.6-11)cfu/mouse, respectively. prevotella oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum produced multiple abscesses and their abscess-forming and lethal abilities were strong: af(50)of p. oralis and f. nucleatum were 10(6.0-6.4)and 10(7. 0-8.7)cfu/mouse, and their ld(50)were 10(7.0-7.7)and 10(8.3-9. 9)cfu/mouse, respectively. ld(50)of p. intermedia and p. gingivalis were 10(9.4->11)and 10(8.9-9.1)cfu/mouse, respectively. prevotella intermedia and porphyromonas gingivalis generated a necrotizing lesion, which progressed rapidly. we conclude  that this murine model could reflect human orofacial odontogenic infections and is useful to investigate the pathogenicity of causative bacteria of such infections.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of putative periodontal pathogens in advanced periodontitis patients.
AB  == in the present study, the antibiotic susceptibility of most prevalent micro-organisms in advanced periodontitis patients was evaluated. in 56 patients, pooled subgingival plaque samples were taken from the deepest site of each quadrant and were cultivated anaerobically. from each patient, the 4 most frequently encountered types of bacterial colonies were subcultured and identified (rapid id 32 a). from all bacterial species identified in the 224 subcultures, the 4 most prevalent were used for susceptibility testing to tetracycline, metronidazole and amoxicillin/clavulanate using the e test. the most prevalent microorganisms were fusobacterium nucleatum (38/214), peptostreptococcus micros (33/214), prevotella oralis (33/214) and porphyromonas  gingivalis (32/214). regarding antibiotic susceptibility it could be shown that minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) in all cases was below antibiotic concentrations achievable in gingival crevicular fluid. however, antibiotic resistance was seen in 3 to 29% of the investigated microorganisms.

TI  == microbiota of successful osseointegrated dental implants.
AB  == background: the long-term survival of dental implants depends, in part, on control of bacterial infection in the peri-implant region. periodontal pathogens  colonized implants symptomatic through infection, whereas the microbiota of successful implants was similar to that of periodontal health. this study examined the impact on the peri-implant microbiota of crown restorations; implant type; length of time of loading; history of implant or periodontal infections; and whether implants replaced single or multiple teeth. it was of particular interest to evaluate implant colonization by species in a newly described red complex of periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus. methods: this study sampled 43 partially edentulous subjects with successfully osseointegrated titanium root-form dental implants. eighty-one (81)  non-submerged and 20 submerged asymptomatic implants, 83 crowned, and 36 uncrowned teeth were sampled from peri-implant or subgingival sites. the microbiota of samples was evaluated using whole genomic dna probes in a checkerboard assay to 23 subgingival species. results: implants were colonized principally by oral streptococci, capnocytophagae, veillonella parvula, peptostreptococcus micros, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the periodontal species,  p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and campylobacter rectus were detected in a few subjects. the microbiota around crowned implants and crowned teeth was similar. streptococcus oralis, p. intermedia, and selenomonas noxia were elevated in samples from uncrowned teeth compared to crowned teeth and implants. microbial complexity increased as loading time increased, but colonization by periodontal pathogens, including red complex  species, was higher in subjects with previous periodontal disease. no differences were observed in the microbiota of 1- and 2-stage implants, or between implants supporting single or multiple restorations. conclusions: while presence of crowns had only a minor impact on the peri-implant microbiota, microbial changes were observed the longer the implants had been in function and in those patients with  a history of periodontal or peri-implant infections. a history of periodontitis had a greater impact on the peri-implant microbiota than implant loading time. the major influence on the peri-implant microbiota was, however, the microbiota on remaining teeth. p. gingivalis and b. forsythus, red complex periodontal pathogens, colonized several implants, although all implants were successfully osseointegrated.

TI  == serum antibodies reacting with subgingival species in refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the levels of serum igg antibody to 85 subgingival species in 32 refractory periodontitis, 56 successfully treated, and 33 periodontally healthy subjects. refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or >3 sites showing attachment loss >2.5 mm within 1 year after 2 treatment modalities, scaling and root planing and surgery plus systemically administered tetracycline. successfully-treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss >2.5 mm, 1 year post-therapy. periodontally healthy subjects exhibited no pocket or attachment level >3 mm, and no evidence of progressing attachment loss during 1 year of monitoring. baseline serum was obtained from each subject and tested against 85 subgingival species, including reference strains and strains isolated from refractory subjects, using checkerboard immunoblotting. significance of differences in levels of serum antibody among groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis test. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based  on their serum antibody response to subgingival species. some individuals had antibody reactions to many subgingival species, while other subjects showed fewer or low numbers of responses. on average, refractory subjects exhibited higher numbers and levels of serum antibody reactions to a wide range of subgingival species than successfully treated or periodontally healthy subjects. differences  in serum antibody among clinical groups were more striking at higher threshold levels of antibody (>50 microg/ml and > 100 microg/ml). the data showed that a subject was 10.1 x more likely to be refractory if the subject exhibited antibody reactions with >9 subgingival species at >50 microg/ml (p<0.001, after adjusting  for multiple comparisons). serum antibody to a subset of the test species differed among the clinical groups. porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroidesforsythus, and some strains isolated from refractory subjects (a novel neisseria sp., enterococcus faecalis, prevotella loescheii and prevotella oulora) elicited high serum antibody in the successfully treated and refractory subjects. high levels of serum antibody to a microbacterium lacticum-like organism, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus constellatus, actinobacillus actinonmycetemcomitans serotype c and haemophilus aphrophilus significantly increased the likelihood of a subject being refractory to conventional periodontal therapy.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == degradation of immunoglobulin g by periodontal bacteria.
AB  == several subgingival microorganisms were tested for their ability to utilize human immunoglobulin g (igg) as a substrate for growth. this was done using a protein-free chemically defined medium, supplemented with igg. stimulation of growth was observed for capnocytophaga ochracea, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella oralis, lactobacillus catenaforme and streptococcus intermedius. immunoelectrophoresis, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and a protein assay demonstrated that p. intermedia and p. endodontalis completely degraded the protein chains of igg. partial breakdown of igg was observed for p. asaccharolytica and c. ochracea, whereas p. oralis cleaved the igg heavy chain, yielding fc and fab fragments. all these bacteria utilized igg as a substrate for growth. binding studies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, revealed complete loss of in vitro antigen-antibody binding capacity after incubation of specific igg with p. endodontalis and partial loss of binding with  p. intermedia, p. gingivalis, c. ochracea or fusobacterium nucleatum. degradation or inactivation of igg by oral bacteria is thought to be important in the causation of polymicrobial infections.

TI  == new findings on the microbial flora associated with adult periodontitis.
AB  == the predominant microbial flora associated with adult periodontitis was investigated in 21 patients aged 20-40 years. microorganisms from samples of subgingival plaque were cultured on selective and non-selective media under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. ten species or groups out of a total of 31 were found to comprise the predominant cultivable flora: diphtheroids, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, coagulase-negative staphylococci, 'streptococcus milleri'-group, bacteroides ureolyticus, capnocytophaga ochracea, the prevotella veroralis/buccalis complex, p. intermedia, p. oralis and unidentified prevotella  spp. two species previously reported at periodontitis sites, namely p. gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum, were not isolated, whereas prevotella species accounted for the majority of isolates in this investigation. the large proportion of non-pigmented prevotella species, p. asaccharolytica and b. ureolyticus that were found have not generally been reported previously. the role of these microorganisms and also coagulase-negative staphylococci, diphtheroids and the 'streptococcus milleri'-group requires further investigation in adult periodontitis.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == to assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7  gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. for comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against prevotella oralis, prevotella buccalis, prevotella bivia, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, bacteroides corporis, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium necrophorum, fusobacterium naviforme and propionibacterium acnes. prevotella oris, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and prevotella denticola, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides pneumosintes, and peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. strains of veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptostreptococcus magnus showed mics of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. the results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving bacteroides fragilis.
