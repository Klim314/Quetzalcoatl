TI  == effects of bile salt deconjugation by probiotic strains on the survival of antibiotic-resistant foodborne pathogens under simulated gastric conditions.
AB  == this study was designed to evaluate the effects of bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains on the antibiotic susceptibility of antibiotic-sensitive and multiple antibiotic-resistant salmonella typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus. eight probiotic strains, bifidobacterium longum b6, lactobacillus acidophilus adh, lactobacillus brevis kacc 10553, lactobacillus casei kacc 12413, lactobacillus paracasei atcc 25598, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, leuconostoc mesenteroides kacc 12312, and pediococcus acidilactici kacc 12307, were used to examine bile acid tolerance. the ability to deconjugate bile acids was evaluated  using both thin-layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography.  the antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out to determine the synergistic inhibitory activity of deconjugated bile acids. l. acidophilus, l. brevis, and p. acidilactici showed the most tolerance to the conjugated bile acids. p. acidilactici deconjugated glycocholic acid and glycodeoxycholate from 3.18 and 3.09 mm to the detection limits, respectively. the antibiotic susceptibility of selected foodborne pathogens was increased by increasing the concentration of deconjugated bile acids. the study results are useful for understanding the relationship between bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains and antibiotic susceptibility in the presence of deconjugated bile acids, and they may be useful for designing new probiotic-antibiotic combination therapy based on bile acid deconjugation.

TI  == protective effect of lactobacillus casei strain shirota against lethal infection  with multi-drug resistant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 in mice.
AB  == aims: the anti-infectious activity of lactobacilli against multi-drug resistant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 (dt104) was examined in a murine model of an opportunistic antibiotic-induced infection. methods and results: explosive intestinal growth and subsequent lethal extra-intestinal translocation  after oral infection with dt104 during fosfomycin (fom) administration was significantly inhibited by continuous oral administration of lactobacillus casei  strain shirota (lcs), which is naturally resistant to fom, at a dose of 10(8) colony-forming units per mouse daily to mice. comparison of the anti-salmonella activity of several lactobacillus type strains with natural resistance to fom revealed that lactobacillus brevis atcc 14869(t) , lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917(t) , lactobacillus reuteri jcm 1112(t) , lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 7469(t) and lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741(t) conferred no activity even when they obtained the high population levels almost similar to those of the effective strains such as lcs, lact. casei atcc 334(t) and lactobacillus zeae atcc 15820(t) . the increase in concentration of organic acids and maintenance of the lower ph in the intestine because of lactobacillus colonization were correlated with the anti-infectious activity. moreover, heat-killed lcs was not protective against the infection, suggesting that the metabolic activity of lactobacilli is important for the anti-infectious activity. conclusion: these results suggest that certain lactobacilli in combination with antibiotics may be  useful for prophylaxis against opportunistic intestinal infections by multi-drug  resistant pathogens, such as dt104. significance and impact of the study: antibiotics such as fom disrupt the metabolic activity of the intestinal microbiota that produce organic acids, and that only probiotic strains that are metabolically active in vivo should be selected to prevent intestinal infection when used clinically in combination with certain antibiotics.

TI  == safety assessment of lactobacillus brevis kb290 as a probiotic strain.
AB  == lactobacillus brevis kb290 (kb290), a plant-derived probiotic lactic acid bacterium, reportedly improves gut health and stimulates immune function. here we extensively investigated the geno-, acute, subacute, and subchronic toxicity of kb290 and its bacterial translocation potential. kb290 was non-mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation assay by the preincubation method. in the single oral  dose toxicity test, kb290 at 10(9) cfu/ml was nontoxic at maximum capacity (20 ml/kg). when 10(8), 10(9), or 10(10) cfu/kg was administered daily to rats by gavage for 2 weeks (subacute assay), we observed no clear treatment-related effect and no evidence of bacterial translocation from the gastrointestinal tract. when it was administered for 13 weeks (subchronic assay), we again observed no clear treatment-related effect and no significant toxicological effect. based on those results, we consider 10(10) cfu/kg per day, the highest dose tested, to be the no observed adverse effect level (noael). these results suggest that kb290 is safe for human consumption.

TI  == functional properties of selected starter cultures for sour maize bread.
AB  == this paper focuses on the functional properties of maize sour-dough microflora selected and tested for their use as starter cultures for sour maize bread. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolated from spontaneously fermented maize dough were selected based on dominance during fermentation and presence at the end of fermentation. functional properties examined included acidification, leavening and production of some antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting matrix. the organisms previously identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. fermentum, lb. acidophilus, pediococcus acidilactici, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc dextranicum and saccharomyces cerevisiae were used singly and as  mixed cultures in the fermentation (fermentation time: 12h at 28+/-2 degrees c) of maize meal (particle size >0.2mm). the ph fell from an initial value of 5.62-3.05 in maize meals fermented with lb. plantarum; 4.37 in l. dextranicum+s.  cerevisiae compared with the value for the control (no starter) of 4.54. significant differences (p <or =0.05) were observed in values obtained for the functional properties tested when starters were inoculated compared with the control (no starter) except for leavening. bivariate correlations at 0.01 levels  (two-tailed) showed that significant correlations existed among ph and production of antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting meals, the highest correlation being between production of diacetyl and acid (0.694), a positive correlation indicating that production of both antimicrobial compounds increase together with time. antimicrobial activities of the fermented maize dough were confirmed by their abilities to inhibit the growth of salmonella typhi, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and aspergillus flavus from an initial inoculum concentration of 7 log cfu ml(-1)) for test bacteria and zone of inhibition of up to 1.33 cm for aflatoxigenic a. flavus. the findings of this study form a database for further studies on the development of starter cultures for sour maize bread production as an alternative bread specialty.

TI  == antibacterial activity of lactobacillus species against vibrio species.
AB  == forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.
