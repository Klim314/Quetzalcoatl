TI  == the complex vaginal flora of west african women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == background: the spectrum of bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv) has recently expanded through taxonomic changes and the use of molecular methods. these methods have yet to be used in large-scale epidemiological studies in africa where bv is highly prevalent. methods: an analysis of samples obtained during a clinical trial of the management of vaginal discharge in four west african countries. samples were available from 1555 participants; 843 (54%) had bv. nucleic acids of 13 bacterial genera or species potentially associated with bv were detected through the polymerase chain reaction. results: the associations between various components of the vaginal flora were complex. excluding lactobacillus, the other 12 micro-organisms were all associated with each other at the p</=0.001 level. the prevalence of various bacterial genera or species varied according to age, sexual activity and hiv status. in multivariate analysis, the presence of gardnerella vaginalis, bifidobacterium, megasphaera elsdenii, dialister, mycoplasma hominis, leptotrichia, and prevotella were independently associated with bv as was the absence of lactobacillus and peptoniphilus. however, mobiluncus, atopobium vaginae, anaerococcus, and eggerthella were not independently associated with bv. unexpectedly, after treatment with a regimen that included either metronidazole or tinidazole, the proportion of patients with a complete resolution of symptoms by day 14 increased with the number of bacterial genera or species present at enrolment. conclusions: numerous bacterial genera or species were strongly associated with each other in  a pattern that suggested a symbiotic relationship. bv cases with a simpler flora  were less likely to respond to treatment. overall, the vaginal flora of west african women with bv was reminiscent of that of their counterparts in industrialized countries.

TI  == culture-independent identification of pathogenic bacteria and polymicrobial infections in the genitourinary tract of renal transplant recipients.
AB  == renal transplant recipients are predisposed to urinary tract infections caused by both common uropathogens and opportunistic bacteria resulting frequently in significant polymicrobial infections. in this study, a culture-independent 16s rrna-based approach was established to identify unusual, fastidious, or anaerobic bacteria and to investigate bacterial diversity in urinary tract specimens. similarly sized amplicons encompassing the v6 to v8 region of the 16s rrna were analyzed with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dhplc) (wave system). artificial mixtures of single amplicons from commonly encountered uropathogenic bacteria produced distinct peak profiles whose identities were confirmed by sequencing individually collected peak products. we evaluated the application of the method on 109 urinary tract specimens from renal transplant recipients; 100% correlation was found for culture-positive specimens, and dhplc  generated peak profiles. however, for culture-negative specimens, dhplc facilitated the detection of novel peak profiles. dna sequencing of these individual peaks was used to identify the bacteria involved. thus, in pcr-positive but culture-negative samples the method allowed detection of previously known uropathogens such as corynebacterium urealyticum and gardnerella vaginalis, but also unusual agents including anaerococcus lactolyticus, bacteroides vulgatus, dialister invisus, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus iners, leptotrichia amnionii, prevotella buccalis, prevotella ruminicola, rahnella aquatilis, and streptococcus intermedius were detected as single pathogens or as constituents of polymicrobial infections. the method described is reproducible and rapidly and enables both dhplc-based profiling and sequence-based investigation of microbial communities and polymicrobial infections. a detailed understanding of infections found in recipients of renal transplants will guide antibiotic therapy regimens and provide new perspectives for decreasing the risk of graft rejection.
