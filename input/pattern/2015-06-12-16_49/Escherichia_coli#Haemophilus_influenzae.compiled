TI  - Prokaryotic High-Level Expression System in Producing Adhesin Recombinant Protein E of Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adhesion protein E (PE) of Haemophilus influenzae is a 16 - 18 kDa protein with 160 amino acids which causes adhesion to epithelial cells and acts as a major factor in pathogenesis. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we performed cloning, expression and purification of PE as a candidate antigen for vaccine design upon further study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: At first, the pe gene of NTHi ATCC 49766 strain (483 bp) was amplified by PCR. Then, to sequence the resulted amplicon, it was cloned into TA vector (pTZ57R/T). In the next step, the sequenced gene was sub-cloned in pBAD/gIII A vector and transformed into competent Escherichia coli TOP10. For overexpression, the recombinant bacteria were grown in broth medium containing arabinose and the recombinant protein was purified using metal affinity chromatography (Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid) (Ni-NTA agarose). Finally, the protein was detected using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophores (SDS-PAG) and confirmed by western blotting. RESULTS: The cloned gene was confirmed by PCR, restriction digestion and sequencing. The sequenced gene was searched for homology in GenBank and 99% similarity was found to the already deposited genes in GenBank. Then we obtained PE using Ni-NTA agarose with up to 7 mg/mL concentration. CONCLUSIONS: The pe gene was successfully cloned and confirmed by sequencing. Finally, PE was obtained with high concentration. Due to high homology and similarity among the pe gene from NTHi ATCC 49766 and other NTHi strains in GenBank, we believe that the protein is a universal antigen to be used as a vaccine design candidate and further studies to evaluate its immunogenicity is underway.
TI  - PCR detection and identification of bacterial contaminants in ocular samples from post-operative endophthalmitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial endophthalmitis is a sight-threatening complication of ocular surgery which requires urgent medical consideration including comprehensive diagnosis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a sensitive molecular method has been extensively used for detection of microbial species in clinical specimens. AIM: The aim of this study was to identify the causative organisms of endophthalmitis in our patient population using a procedure based on PCR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Vitreous samples from 32 patients with post-operative endophthalmitis were collected. Total vitreous DNA was extracted and then assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified from genomic DNA using PCR with a pair of HAD2 universal primers. Library of PCR products from 16S rRNA, cloned into the pTZ57R/T vector. The ligated products were then transformed into E. coli DH5alpha strain and grown in the LB-ampicillin/X-Gal/IPTG plate. RESULTS: From the total of 32 vitreous samples, 18 specimens were positive, illustrating the presence of bacterial infection (56.4 %). Twelve species including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus subtilis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria meningitides, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus were identified using BLAST for known 16S rRNA sequences. CONCLUSION: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) accompanied with cloning and sequencing approved to be sensitive and specific. The rapid molecular technique was useful in detection of 12 major microbial species, in infectious endophthalmitis.
TI  - Development of two real-time multiplex PCR assays for the detection and quantification of eight key bacterial pathogens in lower respiratory tract infection.
AB  - The frequent lack of a positive and timely microbiological diagnosis in patients  with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is an important obstacle to antimicrobial stewardship. Patients are typically prescribed broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics while microbiology results are awaited, but as these are often slow, negative or inconclusive, de-escalation to narrow-spectrum agents rarely occurs in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate two mRT-PCR assays for the sensitive detection and accurate quantification of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. We found that all eight bacterial targets could be reliably quantified from sputum samples down to a concentration of 100 cfu/reaction (8333 cfu/ml). Furthermore, all 249 positive control isolates were correctly detected with our assay, demonstrating effectiveness on both reference strains and local clinical isolates. Specificity was 98% on a panel of nearly 100 negative control isolates. Bacterial load was quantified accurately when three bacterial targets were present in mixtures of varying concentrations, mimicking likely clinical scenarios in LRTI. Concordance with culture was 100% for culture-positive sputa, 90% for bronchoalveolar lavage fluids and additional culture-negative bacterial infections were detected and quantified. In conclusion, a quantitative molecular test for eight key bacterial causes of LRTI has the potential to provide a more sensitive decision-making tool, closer to the time point of patient admission than current standard methods. This should facilitate de-escalation from broad-spectrum to narrow-spectrum antibiotics, substantially improving patient management and supporting efforts to curtail inappropriate antibiotic use.
TI  - [Distribution and drug resistance of the pathogenic bacteria from sputum specimens of 1 125 children with tracheo bronchial foreign bodies].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the distribution and drug susceptibility of the pathogenic  bacteria in the airway secretions in children with tracheobronchial foreign bodies so as to assist physicians in clinical prescription. METHODS: Sputum specimens of 1 125 children with tracheobronchial foreign bodies were collected in removal of the foreign bodies by rigid bronchoscope, and the drug susceptibility test was performed. RESULTS: Pathogenic bacteria were detected in 218 (19.4%) of 1 125 sputum specimens. Among the pathogenic bacteria, 126 (57.79%) strains were gram-negative bacilli, consisting of 76 (34.86%) strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 10 (4.59%) strains of Escherichia coli, 7 (3.21%) strains of Sewer enterobacter, 7 (3.21%) strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 6 (2.75%) strains of Klebsiella bacillus; and 92 (42.21%) strains were gram-positive bacilli, consisting of 80 (36.69%) strains of Streptococcus pneumonia and 10 (4.59%) strains of Escherichia coli. Most of detected gram-negative bacilli were highly sensitive to cefepime, ceftazidine, imipenem and amikacin, no strains were resistant to meropenem and ciprofloxacin. None of the detected gram-positive bacilli were resistant to cefepime, vancomycin, levofloxacin and teicoplanin. CONCLUSIONS: The Haemophilus influenzae of gram-negative bacilli and the Streptococcus pneumonia of gram-positive bacilli are the main pathogenic bacteria existing in the airway secretions of children with tracheobronchial foreign bodies. The Haemophilus influenzae were highly sensitive to cephalosporin, imipenem and amikacin, and the Streptococcus pneumonia to cefepime, vancomycin, levofloxacin and teicoplanin.
TI  - Nosocomial infections after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: time course and causative pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nosocomial infections after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) are associated with prolonged length of stay and poor functional outcome. It remains unclear if infections result in prolonged length of stay or, vice versa, if prolonged length of stay results in more infections. Before strategies can be designed to reduce infections after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, more data are needed on time course and causative pathogens of infections. AIM: To investigate the time course of infection onset and bacterial microorganisms that cause nosocomial infections after aSAH. METHODS: In consecutive patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage admitted to the University Medical Center Utrecht between 2009 and 2011, we analyzed the proportion of patients with infections, day of infection onset, and culture results. RESULTS: Of the 291 included patients, 107 (37%) patients developed 115 nosocomial infections. Fifty-six patients (19%) developed an infection within the first week. Median day of infection onset was for pneumonia (n = 49; 17%) day 4 (interquartile range 3-9), respiratory tract infection (n = 16; 6%) day 4 (interquartile range 1-7), urinary tract infection (n = 27; 9%) day 11 (interquartile range 7-14), and meningitis/ventriculitis (n = 10; 3%) day 19 (interquartile range 9-33). Cultures of infections mostly yielded Staphylococcus aureus (20%), Haemophilus influenzae (15%), and Escherichia coli (14%), CONCLUSION: Nosocomial infections after subarachnoid hemorrhage are common and mostly occur in the first week after ictus. Future studies should investigate if general hygienic measures, infection awareness, minimizing the duration of mechanical ventilation and use of catheters/drains, or prophylactic antibiotics reduce infections and improve functional outcome.
TI  - Glycerophosphorylcholine regulates Haemophilus influenzae glpQ gene expression.
AB  - An important virulence strategy adopted by Haemophilus influenzae to establish a  niche on the mucosal surface of the host is the phosphorylcholine (ChoP) decoration of its lipopolysaccharides, which promotes adherence to the host cells. Haemophilus influenzae is able to use glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC) from host for ChoP synthesis. Utilization of GPC requires glpQ, which encodes a glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase enzyme. In this study, we investigate the transcriptional regulation of glpQ gene using real-time PCR and transcriptional fusion of H. influenzae glpQ promoter to the Escherichia coli lacZ reporter gene. The glpQ promoter activities were examined under environmental conditions including changes in temperature, oxygen, high salt and minimal growth medium. Our data showed that under room temperature and anaerobic conditions, the glpQ gene expression levels were significantly higher than under other growth conditions. In addition, the glpQ gene expression levels were upregulated in the presence of GPC. These results suggest that H. influenzae may upregulate glpQ expression in response to different environments it encounters during infection, from the airway surfaces (room temperature) to deep tissues (anaerobic). Upregulation of glpQ by GPC may allow efficient use of abundant GPC from mammalian cells by H. influenzae as a source of nutrient and for ChoP decoration of lipopolysaccharide that facilitates bacterial adhesion to host cells and growth during infection.
TI  - X-ray crystal structures of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase with switch region binding inhibitors enable rational design of squaramides with an improved fraction unbound to human plasma protein.
AB  - Squaramides constitute a novel class of RNA polymerase inhibitors of which genetic evidence and computational modeling previously have suggested an inhibitory mechanism mediated by binding to the RNA polymerase switch region. An iterative chemistry program increased the fraction unbound to human plasma protein from below minimum detection levels, i.e., <1% to 4-6%, while retaining biochemical potency. Since in vitro antimicrobial activity against an efflux-negative strain of Haemophilus influenzae was 4- to 8-fold higher, the combined improvement was at least 20- to 60-fold. Cocrystal structures of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase with two key squaramides showed displacement of the switch 2, predicted to interfere with the conformational change of the clamp domain and/or with binding of template DNA, a mechanism akin to that of natural product myxopyronin. Furthermore, the structures confirmed the chemical features required for biochemical potency. The terminal isoxazole and benzyl rings bind into distinct relatively narrow, hydrophobic pockets, and both are required for biochemical potency. In contrast, the linker composed of squarate and piperidine accesses different conformations in their respective cocrystal structures with RNA polymerase, reflecting its main role of proper orientation of the aforementioned terminal rings. These observations further explain the tolerance of hydrophilic substitutions in the linker region that was exploited to improve the fraction unbound to human plasma protein while retaining biochemical potency.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam alone and in combination with avibactam against European Gram-negative and Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - Recent clinical isolates of key Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria were collected in 2012 from hospitalised patients in medical centres in four European countries (France, Germany, Italy and Spain) and were tested using standard broth microdilution methodology to assess the impact of 4mg/L avibactam on the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam. Against Enterobacteriaceae, addition of avibactam significantly enhanced the level of activity of these antimicrobials. MIC90 values (minimum inhibitory concentration that inhibits 90% of the isolates) of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii and Morganella morganii were reduced up to 128-fold or greater when combined with avibactam. A two-fold reduction in the MIC90 of ceftazidime to 8mg/L was noted in Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates when combined with avibactam, whereas little effect of avibactam was noted on the MIC values of the test compounds when tested against Acinetobacter baumannii isolates. Avibactam had little effect on the excellent activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against Haemophilus influenzae. It had no impact on the in vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftaroline against staphylococci and streptococci. This study demonstrates that addition of avibactam enhances the activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa but not against A. baumannii.
TI  - LytM proteins play a crucial role in cell separation, outer membrane composition, and pathogenesis in nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - LytM proteins belong to a family of bacterial metalloproteases. In Gram-negative  bacteria, LytM factors are mainly reported to have a direct effect on cell division by influencing cleavage and remodeling of peptidoglycan. In this study, mining nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) genomes, three highly conserved open reading frames (ORFs) containing a LytM domain were identified, and the proteins encoded by the ORFs were named YebA, EnvC, and NlpD on the basis of their homology with the Escherichia coli proteins. Immunoblotting and confocal analysis showed that while NTHI NlpD is exposed on the bacterial surface, YebA and EnvC reside in the periplasm. NTHI DeltayebA and DeltanlpD deletion mutants revealed an aberrant division phenotype characterized by an altered cell architecture and extensive membrane blebbing. The morphology of the DeltaenvC deletion mutant was identical to that of the wild-type strain, but it showed a drastic reduction of periplasmic proteins, including the chaperones HtrA, SurA, and Skp, and an accumulation of beta-barrel-containing outer membrane proteins comprising the autotransporters Hap, IgA serine protease, and HMW2A, as observed by proteomic analysis. These data suggest that EnvC may influence the bacterial surface protein repertoire by facilitating the passage of the periplasmic chaperones through the peptidoglycan layer to the close vicinity of the inner face of the outer membrane. This hypothesis was further corroborated by the fact that an NTHI envC defective strain had an impaired capacity to adhere to epithelial cells and to form biofilm. Notably, this strain also showed a reduced serum resistance. These results suggest that LytM factors are not only important components of cell division but they may also influence NTHI physiology and pathogenesis by affecting membrane composition. IMPORTANCE: Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) is an opportunistic pathogen that colonizes the human nasopharynx and can cause serious infections in children (acute otitis media) and adults (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Several virulence factors are well studied, but the complete scenario of NTHI pathogenesis is still unclear. We identified and characterized three NTHI LytM factors homologous to the Escherichia coli LytM proteins. Although LytM factors are reported to play a crucial role in the cell division process, in NTHI they are also involved in other bacterial functions. In particular, YebA and NlpD are fundamental for membrane stability: indeed, their absence causes an increased release of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). On the other hand, our data suggest that EnvC could directly or indirectly affect peptidoglycan permeability and consequently, bacterial periplasmic and outer membrane protein distribution. Interestingly, by modulating the surface composition of virulence determinants, EnvC also has an impact on NTHI pathogenesis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftaroline tested against bacterial isolates causing respiratory tract and skin and skin structure infections in US medical centers in 2013.
AB  - A total of 4533 isolates from community-acquired respiratory tract infections (CARTIs) and 8446 from skin and skin structure infections (SSSIs) were consecutively collected in 149 US medical centers in 2013. Strains were susceptibility tested by broth microdilution method against ceftaroline and numerous comparators. Ceftaroline (MIC50/90, </=0.015/0.12mug/mL) was more potent than ceftriaxone (MIC50/90, </=0.06/1mug/mL) against Streptococcus pneumoniae and highly active against ceftriaxone-nonsusceptible strains (n=201; MIC90, 0.25mug/mL). Ceftaroline was also very active against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC50/90, 0.008/0.015mug/mL), methicillin-susceptible (MIC50/90, 0.25/0.25mug/mL) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MIC50/90, 1/1mug/mL), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (highest MIC, 0.03mug/mL). Ceftaroline exhibited good activity against non-extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotype isolates of Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli (96.7% susceptible and MIC90 of 0.25mug/mL for both) but limited activity against ESBL phenotype isolates. In summary, ceftaroline exhibited potent in vitro activity against a large collection of bacterial isolates causing CARTI and SSSI in US medical centers.
TI  - Bacterial-resistance among outpatients of county hospitals in China: significant  geographic distinctions and minor differences between central cities.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to survey antibacterial resistance in outpatients of Chinese county hospitals. A total of 31 county hospitals were selected and samples continuously collected from August 2010 to August 2011. Drug sensitivity testing was conducted in a central laboratory. A total of 2946 unique isolates were collected, including 634 strains of Escherichia coli, 606 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 476 Staphylococcus aureus, 308 Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 160 Haemophilus influenzae. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in E. coli (42.3% strains), K. pneumoniae (31.7%), and Proteus mirabilis (39.0%). Ciprofloxacin-resistance was detected in 51.0% of E. coli strains. Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. were sensitive to most antibacterial agents. Less than 8.0% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were resistant to carbapenem. For S. aureus strains, 15.3% were resistant to methicillin, and some strains of S. pneumoniae showed resistance to penicillin (1.6%), ceftriaxone (13.0%), and erythromycin (96.4%). beta-lactamase was produced by 96.5% of Moraxella catarrhalis strains, and 36.2% of H. influenzae isolates were resistant to ampicillin. Azithromycin-resistant H. influenzae, imipenem-resistant but meropenem-sensitive Proteus, and ceftriaxone- and carbapenem non-sensitive M. catarrhalis were recorded. In conclusion, cephalosporin- and quinolone-resistant strains of E. coli and Klebsiella pneumonia and macrolide-resistant Gram-positive cocci were relatively prominent in county hospitals. The antibacterial resistance profiles of isolates from different geographical locations varied significantly, with proportions in county hospitals lower than those in their tertiary counterparts in the central cities, although the difference is diminishing.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis to evaluate ceftaroline fosamil dosing regimens for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and complicated skin and skin-structure infections in patients with normal and impaired renal function.
AB  - In this study, the probability of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target attainment (PTA) of ceftaroline against clinical isolates causing community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) and complicated skin and skin-structure infection (cSSSI) in Europe was evaluated. Three dosing regimens were assessed: 600 mg every 12 h (q12 h) as a 1-h infusion (standard dose) or 600 mg every 8 h (q8 h) as a 2-h infusion in virtual patients with normal renal function; and 400 mg q12 h as a 1-h infusion in patients with moderate renal impairment. Pharmacokinetic and microbiological data were obtained from the literature. The PTA and the cumulative fraction of response (CFR) were calculated by Monte Carlo simulation. In patients with normal renal function, the ceftaroline standard dose (600 mg q12 h as a 1-h infusion) can be sufficient to treat CABP due to ceftazidime-susceptible (CAZ-S) Escherichia coli, CAZ-S Klebsiella pneumoniae, meticillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis (CFR>90%). However, against meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), the CFR was 72%. In cSSSI, the CFR was also <80% for MRSA. Administration of ceftaroline 600 mg q8 h as a 2-h infusion or 400 mg q12 h as a 1-h infusion in patients with moderate renal insufficiency provided a high probability of treatment success (CFR ca. 100%) for most micro-organisms causing CABP and cSSSI, including MRSA and penicillin-non-susceptible S. pneumoniae. These results suggest that in patients with normal renal function, ceftaroline 600 mg q8 h as a 2-h infusion may be a better option than the standard dose, especially if the MRSA rate is high.
TI  - Immune responses to HBsAg conjugated to protein D of non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae in mice.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B vaccine that contains an aluminum hydroxide adjuvant induces apoptotic death of Hepa 1-6 cells. Difficult-to-degrade chemical additives in vaccines effectively enhance vaccine immunogenicity, but also affect the host tissue. Identification of bio-molecules that are readily degraded and compatible in vivo as an adjuvant is important for vaccine research. The hapten-carrier effect suggests that stimulation of helper T (Th) cells by carrier adjuvants is feasible. Protein D (PD) of non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae covalently conjugated to some polysaccharide vaccines has been confirmed to convert T-cell independent (TI) antigens into T-cell dependent (TD) antigens, and elicit strong T-cell responses ultimately. Herein, we would substitube PD for aluminum hydroxide adjuvant in Hepatitis B vaccine. METHODS AND RESULTS: Truncated PD (amino acids 20-364) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by (NH4)2SO4 precipitation and DEAE chromatography. After evaluation of antigenicity by western blotting, PD was covalently conjugated to yeast-derived recombinant HBsAg by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde. Intramuscular immunization with the conjugate induced higher level of HBsAg-specific antibody than did HBsAg alone (p < 0.05), and was comparable to commercial Hepatitis B vaccine. During the surveillance period (days 35-105), anti-HBs titers were hold high. Moreover, the conjugated vaccine enhanced Th1 immune responses, while Th2 responses were also activated and induced an antibody response, as determined by IFN-gamma ELISPOT and IgG1/IgG2a ratio assays. CONCLUSIONS: Recombinant truncated PD covalently conjugated to HBsAg antigen enhanced the immunogenicity of the antigen in mice simultaneously by humoral and cellular immune response, which would facilitate therapeutic hepatitis B vaccines.
TI  - Rapid microbial sample preparation from blood using a novel concentration device.
AB  - Appropriate care for bacteremic patients is dictated by the amount of time needed for an accurate diagnosis. However, the concentration of microbes in the blood is extremely low in these patients (1-100 CFU/mL), traditionally requiring growth (blood culture) or amplification (e.g., PCR) for detection. Current culture-based methods can take a minimum of two days, while faster methods like PCR require a sample free of inhibitors (i.e., blood components). Though commercial kits exist for the removal of blood from these samples, they typically capture only DNA, thereby necessitating the use of blood culture for antimicrobial testing. Here, we report a novel, scaled-up sample preparation protocol carried out in a new microbial concentration device. The process can efficiently lyse 10 mL of bacteremic blood while maintaining the microorganisms' viability, giving a 30-muL final output volume. A suite of six microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans) at a range of clinically relevant concentrations was tested. All of the microorganisms had recoveries greater than 55% at the highest tested concentration of 100 CFU/mL, with three of them having over 70% recovery. At the lowest tested concentration of 3 CFU/mL, two microorganisms had recoveries of ca. 40-50% while the other four gave recoveries greater than 70%. Using a Taqman assay for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA)to prove the feasibility of downstream analysis, we show that our microbial pellets are clean enough for PCR amplification. PCR testing of 56 spiked-positive and negative samples gave a specificity of 0.97 and a sensitivity of 0.96, showing that our sample preparation protocol holds great promise for the rapid diagnosis of bacteremia directly from a primary sample.
TI  - A longitudinal assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility among important pathogens collected as part of the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) in France between 2004 and 2012.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinically important Gram-positive and -negative isolates were collected from patients in France between 2004 and 2012 as a part of the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial. METHODS: MICs were determined using methodology described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. RESULTS: In total, 17,135 isolates were contributed by 29 medical centres; respiratory (25.1%) and cardiovascular (20.3%) sources predominated. High susceptibility was observed among Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA]) to linezolid (100%), tigecycline (>/=99.8%) and vancomycin (>/=94.6%). The percentage of MRSA decreased from 34.3% in 2004 to 20.0% in 2009 before increasing to 34.7% in 2012. Vancomycin, linezolid, levofloxacin and carbapenems were highly active (>/=99.6%) against Streptococcus pneumoniae; 3.2% were PRSP. Escherichia coli showed peak susceptibility to the carbapenems (>/=99.9%), tigecycline (99.3%) and amikacin (97.9%); significant (p < 0.01) decreases in susceptibility were observed for ampicillin, cefepime and ceftriaxone between 2004 and 2012. ESBL production among E. coli increased from 3.0% (2004) to 14.9% (2012). High susceptibility was noted among Haemophilus influenzae to levofloxacin (100%), amoxicillin-clavulanate (99.2%), carbapenems (>/=98.7%) and ceftriaxone (98.5%); beta-lactamase production fluctuated with no notable trend between 18.1% (2007) and 27.7% (2011). Klebsiella spp. were highly susceptible to carbapenems (>/=99.6%) and amikacin (>/=96.4%); significant (p < 0.01) decreases in amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefepime, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, piperacillin-tazobactam and tigecycline susceptibility were observed among K. pneumoniae between 2004 and 2012. Only imipenem was highly active (96.5% susceptible) against Acinetobacter baumannii. Imipenem and amikacin (87.7% and 87.1% susceptible) were the most active agents against P. aeruginosa; 10.2% of isolates were categorized as multidrug resistant. CONCLUSIONS: Carbapenems, linezolid, tigecycline and vancomycin conserved good in vitro activity against most pathogens (according to their spectrum of activity) in France between 2004 and 2012.
TI  - Recombinant expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of Haemophilus influenzae BamD and BamCD complex.
AB  - The Bam machinery, which is highly conserved from bacteria to humans, is well recognized as the apparatus responsible for the insertion and folding of most outer membrane proteins in Gram-negative bacteria. In Escherichia coli, the Bam machinery consists of five components (i.e. BamA, BamB, BamC, BamD and BamE). In comparison, there are only four partners in Haemophilus influenzae: a BamB homologue is not found in its genome. In this study, the recombinant expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of H. influenzae BamD and BamCD complex are reported. The genes encoding BamC and BamD were cloned into a pET vector and expressed in E. coli. Affinity, ion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatography were used to obtain high-purity protein for further crystallographic characterization. Using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion technique, BamD and BamCD protein crystals of suitable size were obtained using protein concentrations of 70 and 50 mg ml(-1), respectively. Preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the BamD crystals diffracted to 4.0 A resolution and belonged to space group P212121, with unit-cell parameters a = 54.5, b = 130.5, c = 154.7 A. The BamCD crystals diffracted to 3.8 A resolution and belonged to space group I212121, with unit-cell parameters a = 101.6, b = 114.1, c = 234.9 A.
TI  - Global assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility among Gram-negative organisms collected from pediatric patients between 2004 and 2012: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) was designed to monitor  susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial agents among important pathogens. We report here on susceptibility among Gram-negative pathogens collected globally from pediatric patients between 2004 and 2012. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using guidelines published by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Most Enterobacteriaceae showed high rates of susceptibility (>95%) to amikacin, tigecycline, and the carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem); 90.8% of Acinetobacter baumannii isolates were susceptible to minocycline, and susceptibility rates were highest in North America, Europe, and Asia/Pacific Rim. Amikacin was the most active agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (90.4% susceptibility), with susceptibility rates being highest in North America. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were reported for 11.0% of Escherichia coli isolates and 24.2% of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates globally, with rates reaching as high as 25.7% in the Middle East and >43% in Africa and Latin America, respectively. Statistically significant (P<0.01) differences in susceptibility rates were noted between pediatric age groups (1 to 5 years, 6 to 12 years, or 13 to 17 years of age), globally and in some regions, for all pathogens except Haemophilus influenzae. Significant (P<0.01) differences were reported for all pathogens globally and in most regions, considerably more frequently, when pediatric and adult susceptibility results were compared. Amikacin, tigecycline, and the carbapenems were active in vitro against most Gram-negative pathogens collected from pediatric patients; A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa were susceptible to fewer antimicrobial agents. Susceptibility rates among isolates from pediatric patients were frequently different from those among isolates collected from adults.
TI  - [A study on the epidemic of pneumonia among children in Ningbo City, Zhejiang province, 2009-2012].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the epidemiological characteristics and the bacterial pathogen composition of pneumonia among children under 5 years old in Ningbo. METHODS: In 2013 February-April, we selected pediatric ward in three hospitals according to stratified cluster random sampling, and from which we collected all 57 556 hospitalized cases in January 2009-December 2012 period of children under 5 years old. A total of 16 740 medical records and bacterial spectrum records of pneumonia or bronchial pneumonia cases among children under 5 years old were described to calculate the proportions of children pneumonia or bronchial pneumonia hospitalized cases accounted for hospitalized children over the same period(referred to as proportions of pneumonia incidence), the detection rate of bacterial pathogens, proportions of bacterial spectrum, and to analyze the characteristics and bacterial pathogen composition of pneumonia among children under 5 years. RESULTS: The proportions of children pneumonia in 2009-2012 were 26.16% (2 882/11 017), 31.23% (4 004/12 819), 29.35% (4 898/16 689) and 29.10% (4 956/17 031)(Z = 3.13, P < 0.01), and were in a downward trend by the increasing of age(Z = -113.74, P < 0.01). The proportions of children pneumonia of 0-5 age group were 50.71% (6 756/13 318), 26.60% (3 159/11 877), 24.17% (2 574 /10 648), 22.36% (2 509 /11 223) and 16.63% (1 745 /10 490). The proportions of children pneumonia with different season were 26.90% (3 725/13 850), 26.51% (3 788/14 287), 29.59% (4 442/15 011) and 33.21% (4 785 /14 408) (chi(2) = 198.77, P < 0.01). The proportions of severe children pneumonia of 0-5 age group were 1.10% (74/6 753), 0.47% (15/3 159), 0.19% (5 /2 574),0.08% (2 /2 509) and 0.06% (1 /1 745), with a downward trend by the age(F = 57.62, P < 0.01). The detection rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae,Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae was 19.3% (540/2 805), 16.4% (460/2 805), 13.6% (381/2 805), 11.9% (335/2 805), 11.5% (323/2 805) and 6.8% (192/2 805). CONCLUSION: In 2009-2012, the proportions of children pneumonia under 5 year old constituted a relatively high proportion in Ningbo city. Children under 1 year old were the major suffering group of pneumonia and severe pneumonia, which should be the key prevention group. The major bacterial pathogens of children's pneumonia in Ningbo are gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of Juniperus excelsa Bieb. (Cupressaceae) grown in R. Macedonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are no information of the yield, chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of berries (EOB) or leaves (EOL) of Juniperus excelsa Bieb. (Cupressaceae) growing wild in R. Macedonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plant material was collected from two localities during two seasons. Essential oil composition was analyzed by gas chromatography/flame ionization detector/mass spectrometry (GC/FID/MS) and antimicrobial screening was made by disc diffusion and broth dilution method. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: EOB yield ranged from 1.6-9.4 ml/kg and from 8.9-13.9 ml/kg for EOL. Two chemotypes of essential oil were differentiated, alpha-pinene-type (with 70.81% alpha-pinene in EOB and 33.83% in EOL), also containing limonene, beta-pinene and beta-myrcene while the sabinene-type (with 58.85-62.58% sabinene in EOB and 28.52-29.49% in EOL), was rich in alpha-pinene, beta-myrcene, limonene, cis-thujone, terpinolene and alpha-thujene. The most sensitive bacteria to the antimicrobial activity of EOB was Haemophilus influenzae (MIC = 31 mul/ml). EOL have showed high activity towards: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae (MIC = 125 mul/ml). The pinene-type of essential oil showed moderate activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Corynebacterium spp. and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC >50%). The sabinene-type of the oil showed moderate activity to Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemopilus influenzae, Campylobacter jejuni and Escherichia coli (MIC >50%). No activity was observed toward Candida albicans. CONCLUSION: The analysis of EOB and EOL revealed two chemotypes (alpha-pinene and sabinene type) clearly depended on the geographical origin of the Macedonian Juniperus excelsa which also affected the antimicrobial activity of these oils.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and mechanism of action of Monarda punctata essential oil  and its main components against common bacterial pathogens in respiratory tract.
AB  - The aim of the current research work was to study the chemical composition of the essential oil of Monarda punctata along with evaluating the essential oil and its major components for their antibacterial effects against some frequently encountered respiratory infection causing pathogens. Gas chromatographic mass spectrometric analysis revealed the presence of 13 chemical constituents with thymol (75.2%), p-cymene (6.7%), limonene (5.4), and carvacrol (3.5%) as the major constituents. The oil composition was dominated by the oxygenated monoterpenes. Antibacterial activity of the essential oil and its major constituents (thymol, p-cymene, limonene) was evaluated against Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli. The study revealed that the essential oil and its constituents exhibited a broad spectrum and variable degree of antibacterial activity against different strains. Among the tested strains, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the most susceptible bacterial strain showing lowest MIC and MBC values. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was the most resistant bacterial strain to the essential oil treatment showing relatively higher MIC and MBC values. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the essential oil induced potent and dose-dependent membrane damage in S. pyogenes and MRSA bacterial strains. The reactive oxygen species generated by the Monarda punctata essential oil were identified using 2', 7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA).This study indicated that the Monarda punctata essential oil to a great extent and thymol to a lower extent triggered a substantial increase in the ROS levels in S. pyogenes bacterial cultures which ultimately cause membrane damage as revealed by SEM results.
TI  - Role of the nuclease of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae in dispersal of organisms from biofilms.
AB  - Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) forms biofilms in the middle ear during human infection. The biofilm matrix of NTHI contains extracellular DNA. We show that NTHI possesses a potent nuclease, which is a homolog of the thermonuclease of Staphylococcus aureus. Using a biofilm dispersal assay, studies showed a biofilm dispersal pattern in the parent strain, no evidence of dispersal in the nuclease mutant, and a partial return of dispersion in the complemented mutant. Quantitative PCR of mRNA from biofilms from a 24-h continuous flow system demonstrated a significantly increased expression of the nuclease from planktonic organisms compared to those in the biofilm phase of growth (P < 0.042). Microscopic analysis of biofilms grown in vitro showed that in the nuclease mutant the nucleic acid matrix was increased compared to the wild-type and complemented strains. Organisms were typically found in large aggregates, unlike the wild-type and complement biofilms in which the organisms were evenly dispersed throughout the biofilm. At 48 h, the majority of the organisms in the mutant biofilm were dead. The nuclease mutant formed a biofilm in the chinchilla model of otitis media and demonstrated a propensity to also form similar large aggregates of organisms. These studies indicate that NTHI nuclease is involved in biofilm remodeling and organism dispersal.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils of Pinus peuce (Pinaceae) growing wild in R. Macedonia.
AB  - The chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils isolated from twigs with needles (T+N) and from twigs without needles (T-N) from wild Pinus peuce Griseb. (Pinaceae), from three different locations in R. Macedonia, were investigated. Essential oil yields of T+N ranged from 7.5 mL/kg to 12.5 mL/kg and for T-N from 13.8 mL/kg to 17.3 mL/kg. GC/FID/MS analysis of the essential oils revealed eighty-four components, representing 93.7-95.7% and 91.2-92.0% of the T+N and T-N oils, respectively. The major components in T+N and T-N oils were monoterpenes: alpha-pinene (23.8-39.9%, 21.2-23.3%), camphene (2.2-5.5%, 0.7-2.0%), beta-pinene (10.1-17.1%, 8.2-16.4%), myrcene (1.2-1.41%, 1.6-2.5%), limonene+beta-phellandrene (6.8-14.0%, 8.8-23.6%) and bornyl acetate (2.3-6.9%, 1.1-3.4%), followed by the sesquiterpenes: trans-(E)-caryophyllene (3.6-4.3%, 3.2-7.3%), germacrene D (7.1-9.5%, 5.0-10.3%) and delta-cadinene (2.1-3.1%, 3.3-4.2%, respectively). Antimicrobial screening of the essential oils was made by disk diffusion and broth dilution methods against 13 bacterial isolates of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and one strain of Candida albicans. T-N essential oils showed antimicrobial activity toward Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Candida albicans as well as Streptococcus agalactiae, Acinetobacter spp. and Haemophilus influenzae. The antimicrobial activity of T+N essential oils was greater, especially against Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pyogenes, Enterococcus and Candida albicans, followed by Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of all tested essential oils ranged from 15-125 muL/mL. Summarizing the obtained results, the antimicrobial activity of Pinus peuce T+N and T-N essential oils collected from different localities in R. Macedonia varied considerably. These alterations in the antimicrobial activity can be attributed to the differences in the quantitative composition and percentage amounts of the components present in the respective essential oils, although it was evident that there were no differences in the qualitative composition of the essential oils, regardless of the locality of collection, or the type of plant material (T+N or T-N).
TI  - Antibacterial activity and mode of action of the Artemisia capillaris essential oil and its constituents against respiratory tract infection-causing pathogens.
AB  - Inhalation therapy using essential oils has been used to treat acute and chronic  sinusitis and bronchitis. The aim of the present study was to determine the chemical composition of the essential oil of Artemisia capillaris, and evaluate the antibacterial effects of the essential oil and its main components, against common clinically relevant respiratory bacterial pathogens. Gas chromatography and gas chromatographymass spectrometry revealed the presence of 25 chemical constituents, the main constituents being: alphapinene, betapinene, limonene, 1,8cineole, piperitone, betacaryophyllene and capillin. The antibacterial activities of the essential oil, and its major constituents, were evaluated against Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), MRSA (clinical strain), methicillingentamicin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MGRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli. The essential oil and its constituents exhibited a broad spectrum and variable degree of antibacterial activity against the various strains. The essential oil was observed to be much more potent, as compared with any of its major chemical constituents, exhibiting low minimum inhibitory and bacteriocidal concentration values against all of the bacterial strains. The essential oil was most active against S. pyogenes, MRSA (clinical strain), S. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and E. coli. Piperitone and capillin were the most potent growth inhibitors, among the major chemical constituents. Furthermore, the essential oil of A. capillaris induced significant and dosedependent morphological changes in the S. aureus bacterial strain, killing >90% of the bacteria when administered at a higher dose; as determined by scanning electron microscopy. In addition, the essential oil induced a significant leakage of potassium and phosphate ions from the S. aureus bacterial cultures. These results indicate that the antibacterial action of A. capillaris essential oil may be mediated through the leakage of these two important ions. In conclusion, A. capillaris essential oil exhibits potent antibacterial activity by inducing morphological changes and leakage of ions in S. aureus bacterial cultures.
TI  - CRP-dependent positive autoregulation and proteolytic degradation regulate competence activator Sxy of Escherichia coli.
AB  - Natural competence, the ability of bacteria to take up exogenous DNA and incorporate it into their chromosomes, is in most bacteria a transient phenomenon under complex genetic and environmental control. In the Gram-negative bacteria Haemophilus influenzae and Vibrio cholerae, the master regulator Sxy/TfoX controls competence development. Although not known to be naturally competent, Escherichia coli possesses a Sxy homologue and a competence regulon containing the genes required for DNA uptake. Here, we show that in contrast to other characterised Gamma-proteobacteria, E. coli Sxy is positively autoregulated at the level of transcription by a mechanism that requires cAMP receptor protein (CRP), cyclic AMP (cAMP) and a CRP-S site in the sxy promoter. Similarly, we found no evidence that Sxy expression in E. coli was regulated at the translational level. However, our analysis revealed that Sxy is an unstable protein and that its cellular level is negatively regulated at the post-translational level via degradation by Lon protease. Interestingly, in the Gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis, the competence master regulator ComK is also positively autoregulated at the level of transcription and negatively regulated by proteolysis. Together, these findings reveal striking similarities between the competence regulons of a Gram-positive and a Gram-negative bacterium.
TI  - [Recurrent meningitis due to anatomical defects: The bacteria indicates its origin].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recurrent meningitis is a rare disease. Anatomical abnormalities and immunodeficiency states are predisposing factors. Four cases, in which immunodeficiency was excluded, are presented. The causal microorganism led to the detection of the anatomical defect responsible for the recurrences. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of 4 cases with clinical diagnosis of recurrent bacterial meningitis. RESULTS: Case 1: a thirty month-old boy with unilateral hearing loss, diagnosed with Mondini abnormality by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after 2 episodes of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis. Surgical repair after third recurrence. Case 2: fourteen year-old girl diagnosed by MRI with cribriform plate defect after 3 episodes of meningitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed. Case 3: girl with meningitis due to Staphylococcus aureus at 2 and 7 months. MRI shows occipital dermal sinus requiring excision. Complication with cerebellar abscesses because of a coexisting dermoid cyst. Case 4: child with meningitis due to Streptococcus bovis at 9 days and Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli at 7 months, with positive cultures to Citrobacter freundii and E. faecium later on. Spinal MRI led to the diagnosis of Currarino syndrome with CSF fistula, which was surgically repaired. The 4 patients had undergone image studies reported as normal during the first episodes. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with recurrent meningitis the possibility of an anatomical defect should be considered. The isolated microorganism should help to locate it. It is essential to know the normal flora of the different anatomical sites. The definitive treatment is usually surgical.
TI  - Treatment strategies for central nervous system infections: an update.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Central nervous system infection continues to be an important cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Our incomplete knowledge on the pathogenesis of how meningitis-causing pathogens cause CNS infection and emergence of antimicrobial resistance has contributed to the mortality and morbidity. An early empiric antibiotic treatment is critical for the management of patients with bacterial meningitis, but early recognition of bacterial meningitis continues to be a challenge. AREAS COVERED: This review gives an overview on current therapeutic strategies for CNS infection with a focus on recent literature since 2010 on bacterial meningitis. Bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency, requiring early recognition and treatment. The selection of appropriate empiric antimicrobial regimen, after incorporating the epidemiology of bacterial meningitis, impact of vaccination, emergence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, role of adjunctive therapy and the current knowledge on the pathogenesis of meningitis and associated neuronal injury are covered. EXPERT OPINION: Prompt treatment of bacterial meningitis with an appropriate antibiotic is essential. Optimal antimicrobial treatment of bacterial meningitis requires bactericidal agents able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, with efficacy in cerebrospinal fluid. Emergence of CNS-infecting pathogens with resistance to conventional antibiotics has been increasingly recognized, but development of new antibiotics has been limited. More complete understanding of the microbial and host factors that are involved in the pathogenesis of bacterial meningitis and associated neurologic sequelae is likely to help in developing new strategies for the prevention and therapy of bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Characterization of tryptophanase from Vibrio cholerae.
AB  - Tryptophanase (Trpase) is a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme responsible for the production of indole, an important intra- and interspecies signaling molecule in bacteria. In this study, the tnaA gene of Vibrio cholerae coding for VcTrpase was cloned into the pET-20b(+) vector and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) tn5:tnaA. Using Ni(2+)-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) chromatography, VcTrpase was purified, and it possessed a molecular mass of approximately 49 kDa with specific absorption peaks at 330 and 435 nm and a specific activity of 3 U/mg protein. The VcTrpase had an 80 % homology to the Trpase of Haemophilus influenzae and E. coli, but only around 50 % identity to the Trpase of Proteus vulgaris and Porphyromonas gingivalis. The optimum conditions for the enzyme were at pH 9.0 and 45 degrees C. Recombinant VcTrpase exhibited analogous kinetic reactivity to the EcTrpase with K m and k cat values of 0.612 x 10(-3) M and 5.252 s(-1), respectively. The enzyme catalyzed S-methyl-L-cysteine and S-benzyl-L-cysteine degradation, but not L-phenylalanine and L-serine. Using a site-directed mutagenesis technique, eight residues (Thr52, Tyr74, Arg103, Asp137, Arg230, Lys269, Lys270, and His463) were conserved for maintaining enzyme catalysis. All amino acid substitutions at these sites either eliminated or remarkably diminished Trpase activity. These sites are thus potential targets for the design of drugs to control the V. cholerae Trpase and to further investigate its functions.
TI  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia after cardiac surgery: a meta-analysis and systematic review.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most common and serious nosocomial infection that threatens patients who have undergone cardiac surgery. This article summarizes its clinical characteristics and provides theoretical evidence for prevention and treatment. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Knowledge databases and by manual search. Data involving the prevalence, etiology, risk factors, or clinical outcomes were extracted for systematic review and meta-analysis. RESULTS: Eleven studies on VAP after cardiac surgery were included. When the results were merged the VAP rate was 21.27/1000 ventilator-days. The prevalence reached 6.37% of all patients and 35.2% of patients who were on mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours. Among the isolated pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa had the highest detection rate, with an average of 23.19%, followed by Staphylococcus aureus (20.15%), Haemophilus influenzae (19.53%), Acinetobacter baumannii (10.68%), Escherichia coli (10.18%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.52%), and Candida albicans (7.20%). Risk factors were also analyzed. We found that New York Heart Association cardiac function class IV, pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral vascular disease, renal disease, emergency surgery, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, cardiopulmonary bypass time, aortic crossclamp time, mechanical ventilation time, reintervention, and reintubation were closely related to the occurrence of VAP; there was no association with gender and diabetes mellitus. Once patients had VAP, mortality and length of stay in the intensive care unit were significantly increased. CONCLUSIONS: VAP in patients after cardiac surgery is common and has a poor prognosis. It is mainly caused by gram-negative bacteria, and could be affected by a series of factors.
TI  - Ceftaroline activity tested against bacterial isolates from pediatric patients: results from the assessing worldwide antimicrobial resistance and evaluation program for the United States (2011-2012).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ceftaroline, the active form of ceftaroline fosamil, is a cephalosporin with broad-spectrum bactericidal activity against resistant Gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, ceftriaxone-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and many Enterobacteriaceae species. Ceftaroline fosamil is approved in the United States for treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia in adults. METHODS: A total of 5291 consecutive unique pediatric patient strains of clinical significance were collected from 157 US medical centers. The isolates were identified locally and forwarded to a central monitoring laboratory for reference antimicrobial susceptibility testing. S. pneumoniae isolates from the 2011 to 2012 respiratory season were serotyped. Susceptibility results were analyzed according to patient age as follows: </= 1 years old (yo; 1857 strains); 2-5 (1342); 6-12 (1281) and 13-17 (811). RESULTS: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus rates were slightly lower in isolates from patients 13-17 yo (39.9%) compared with other age groups (48.2-51.5%), and ceftaroline was consistently active against S. aureus isolates from all 4 age groups [minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC50/90): 0.25-05/1 mug/mL; 99.8-100.0% susceptible]. Overall, 99.8% of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were ceftaroline susceptible (MIC50/90: 0.5/1 mug/mL). All S. pneumoniae strains (1178) were ceftaroline susceptible (MIC50/90: </= 0.015/0.12 mug/mL), whereas ceftriaxone susceptibility varied from only 84.8 (</= 1 yo) to 89.7% (13-17 yo). 19A was the most frequent serotype identified among S. pneumoniae and these isolates exhibited low susceptibility to ceftriaxone (42.4%) and most other antimicrobials tested. The highest ceftaroline MIC among Haemophilus influenzae (587 strains) was 0.12 mug/mL (100.0% susceptible), and beta-lactamase production rates varied from 24.2 (13-17 yo) to 30.1% (6-12 yo); 27.9% overall. Ceftaroline was also active against beta-hemolytic streptococci (556 strains, highest MIC, 0.06 mug/mL). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-phenotype rates among Escherichia coli/Klebsiella spp. were 6.0/5.1, 11.0/11.5, 5.1/8.3 and 11.4/14.7% for the </= 1, 2-5, 6-12 and 13-17 yo age groups, respectively. Ceftaroline exhibited good activity against non-ESBL phenotype strains of E. coli and Klebsiella spp. (MIC90: 0.25 mug/mL for both organisms), but had limited activity against ESBL-producing strains. CONCLUSION: Ceftaroline demonstrated potent in vitro activity when tested against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, beta-hemolytic streptococci and non-ESBL-phenotype E. coli and Klebsiella spp. strains isolated from pediatric patients, independent of patient age.
TI  - Mono-N-acyl-2,6-diaminopimelic acid derivatives: analysis by electromigration and spectroscopic methods and examination of enzyme inhibitory activity.
AB  - Thirteen mono-N-acyl derivatives of 2,6-diaminopimelic acid (DAP)-new potential inhibitors of the dapE-encoded N-succinyl-l,l-diaminopimelic acid desuccinylase (DapE; EC 3.5.1.18)-were analyzed and characterized by infrared (IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies and two capillary electromigration methods: capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) and micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC). Structural features of DAP derivatives were characterized by IR and NMR spectroscopies, whereas CZE and MEKC were applied to evaluate their purity and to investigate their electromigration properties. Effective electrophoretic mobilities of these compounds were determined by CZE in acidic and alkaline background electrolytes (BGEs) and by MEKC in acidic and alkaline BGEs containing a pseudostationary phase of anionic detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) or cationic detergent cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). The best separation of DAP derivatives, including diastereomers of some of them, was achieved by MEKC in an acidic BGE (500 mM acetic acid [pH 2.54] and 60mM SDS). All DAP derivatives were examined for their ability to inhibit catalytic activity of DapE from Haemophilus influenzae (HiDapE) and ArgE from Escherichia coli (EcArgE). None of these DAP derivatives worked as an effective inhibitor of HiDapE, but one derivative-N-fumaryl, Me-ester-DAP-was found to be a moderate inhibitor of EcArgE, thereby providing a promising lead structure for further studies on ArgE inhibitors.
TI  - Comparative study of bacteriological culture and real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) and multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot (mPCR/RLB) hybridization assay in the diagnosis of bacterial neonatal meningitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial meningitis is more common in the neonatal period than any other time in life; however, it is still a challenge for the evidence based diagnosis. Strategy for identification of neonatal bacterial meningitis pathogens is presented by evaluating three different available methods to establish evidence-based diagnosis for neonatal bacterial meningitis. METHODS: The cerebrospinal fluid samples from 56 neonates diagnosed as bacterial meningitis in 2009 in Beijing Children's Hospital were analyzed in the study. Two PCR based molecular assays, real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) and multiplex PCR based-reverse line blot hybridization (mPCR/RLB), were used to assess 7 common neonatal meningitis bacterial pathongens, including Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Listerisa monocytogenes, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus agalactiae. The findings in examinations of two assays were compared with the results obtained bacterial culture tests. RESULTS: Bacterial meningitis was identified in five cases (9%) by CSF cultures, 25 (45%) by RT-PCR and 16 (29%) by mPCR/RLB. One strain of S. epidermidis and one of E. faecalis were identified using mPCR/RLB but not by RT-PCR. In contrast, cultures identified one strain of S. pneumoniae which was missed by both PCR assays. Overall, the bacterial pathogens in 28 cases were identified with these three methods. Both RT-PCR and mPCR/RLB assays were more sensitive than bacterial culture, (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that both RT-PCR and mPCR/RLB assays have better sensitivity than bacterial culture. They are capable of detecting the pathogens in CSF samples with negative culture results.
TI  - [Surveillance report of drug-resistant bacteria from 2007 to 2012 in Saga Prefecture, Japan (the second report)].
AB  - Drug-resistant bacteria are a problematic issue in Japan. Surveillance of drug-resistant bacteria is important because the frequency of isolation and kinds of such bacteria vary between hospitals and local areas. This study summarizes the results of detection of drug-resistant bacteria in Saga Prefecture from July 2007 to June 2012. Data presented in this study were collected through questionnaire survey that was conducted in 12 hospitals. Frequency of drug-resistant bacteria are as follows: 62.5% of Staphylococcus aureus was methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA); 62.2% of Streptococcus pneumoniae was penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP) or penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP); 26.4% of Haemophilus influenzae was beta-lactamase negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae (BLNAR); 0.5% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) P. aeruginosa; 0.5% of P. aeruginosa was multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa (MDRP); 12.9% and 5.1% of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively, were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing organisms. While the isolation frequencies of MRSA and PISP/PRSP were unchanged, those of BLNAR, ESBL producing E. coli and ESBL producing K. pneumoniae raised from 15.4% to 34.2%, from 5.7% to 18.4% and from 2.6% to 8.2%, respectively, over the past 5 years. The frequencies of isolation of MDRP and two drug resistant P. aeruginosa declined. This study revealed that the overall trend in the long-term changes of isolation frequency of drug-resistant bacteria in Saga Prefecture is similar to the trend in the national data. It also showed that the frequency and kinds of drug-resistant bacteria are variable between hospitals and local areas. Further study, such as examination of the usage and MIC value of antimicrobial drugs, will enable us to gain more detailed information on the drug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - [Colonization properties of opportunistic bacteria isolated from children with pneumonia].
AB  - AIM: Evaluation of phenotypes and pathogenicity factors of 476 opportunistic bacteria isolated from respiratory samples of 973 children with community-acquired pneumonia and 36 children without respiratory infection symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quantitative method of tracheal aspirate and nasopharyngeal swab seeding into certified nutrient media was used, identification was carried out according to standard techniques. RESULTS: Adhesive, "anti-interferon", anti-lysozyme and inherent bactericidal activity of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. were established to ensure in combination with known aggression factors their colonization advantage compared with other pneumopathogens. Adhesion indexes of Gram-negative bacteria lower than 2.5 are shown as markers of invasive strains. Anti-lysozyme activity level lower than 2.14 microg/ml and lack of "anti-interferon" activity characterize non-invasive opportunistic bacteria strains. CONCLUSION: The detected phenotypic features of opportunistic bacteria may be used in clinical practice for evaluatio of etiologic importance of microorganisms isolated from tracheal aspirate in pneumonia patients.
TI  - Sharpening rhomboid specificity by dimerisation and allostery.
AB  
TI  - Allosteric regulation of rhomboid intramembrane proteolysis.
AB  - Proteolysis within the lipid bilayer is poorly understood, in particular the regulation of substrate cleavage. Rhomboids are a family of ubiquitous intramembrane serine proteases that harbour a buried active site and are known to cleave transmembrane substrates with broad specificity. In vitro gel and Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based kinetic assays were developed to analyse cleavage of the transmembrane substrate psTatA (TatA from Providencia stuartii). We demonstrate significant differences in catalytic efficiency (kcat/K0.5) values for transmembrane substrate psTatA (TatA from Providencia stuartii) cleavage for three rhomboids: AarA from P. stuartii, ecGlpG from Escherichia coli and hiGlpG from Haemophilus influenzae demonstrating that rhomboids specifically recognize this substrate. Furthermore, binding of psTatA occurs with positive cooperativity. Competitive binding studies reveal an exosite-mediated mode of substrate binding, indicating allostery plays a role in substrate catalysis. We reveal that exosite formation is dependent on the oligomeric state of rhomboids, and when dimers are dissociated, allosteric substrate activation is not observed. We present a novel mechanism for specific substrate cleavage involving several dynamic processes including positive cooperativity and homotropic allostery for this interesting class of intramembrane proteases.
TI  - Recent trends in pediatric bacterial meningitis in Japan--a country where Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae conjugated vaccines have just been introduced.
AB  - To investigate the trends in incidence and the characteristics of bacterial meningitis in Japan where Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine and 7-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV7) were introduced in 2008 and 2010, respectively, which was 5-20 years after their introduction in western countries. The nationwide Japanese survey of pediatric and neonatal bacterial meningitis was performed in 2011 and 2012. We analyzed the epidemiological and clinical data, and compared the information obtained in the previous nationwide survey database. We also investigated the risk factors for disease outcome. In the 2011-2012 surveys, 357 patients were evaluated. H. influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Escherichia coli were the main organisms. The number of patients hospitalized with bacterial meningitis per 1000 admissions decreased from 1.31 in 2009 to 0.43 in 2012 (p < 0.001). The incidence of H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae meningitis also decreased from 0.66 to 0.08 (p < 0.001), and 0.30 to 0.06 (p < 0.001), respectively. Only 0-2 cases with Neisseria meningitidis were reported each year throughout 2001-2012. The median patient age was 10-12 months in 2001-2011, and became lower in 2012 (2 month old) (p < 0.001). The fatality rate for S. agalactiae is the highest (5.9% (11/187)) throughout 2001-2012 among the four organisms. Risk factors for death and sequelae were convulsions at onset, low CSF glucose, S. agalactiae etiology, and persistent positive CSF culture. Hib vaccine and PCV7 decreased the rate of bacterial meningitis. Earlier introduction of these vaccines may have prevented bacterial meningitis among Japanese children.
TI  - Identification of a Haemophilus influenzae factor H-Binding lipoprotein involved  in serum resistance.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae is a Gram-negative human pathogen that resides in the upper respiratory tract. Encapsulated H. influenzae type b (Hib) and type f (Hif) are the most common serotypes associated with invasive disease. H. influenzae displays various strategies to circumvent the host innate immune response, including the bactericidal effect of the complement system. In this study, we identified an H. influenzae lipoprotein having the ability to bind factor H (FH), the major regulator of the alternative pathway of complement activation. This protein, named protein H (PH), was surface exposed and was found in all clinical Hib and Hif isolates tested. Deletion of the gene encoding for PH (lph) in Hib and Hif significantly reduced the interaction between bacteria and FH. When Hib and Hif PH variants were separately expressed in nontypeable (unencapsulated) H. influenzae, which did not bind FH, an increased FH affinity was observed. We recombinantly expressed the two PH variants in Escherichia coli, and despite sharing only 56% identical amino acids, both FH-binding Haemophilus proteins similarly interacted with the complement regulator FH short consensus repeats 7 and 18-20. Importantly, Hib and Hif resistance against the bactericidal effect of human serum was significantly reduced when bacterial mutants devoid of PH were tested. In conclusion, we have characterized a hitherto unknown bacterial protein that is crucial for mediating an interaction between the human pathogen H. influenzae and FH. This novel interaction is important for H. influenzae resistance against complement activation and will consequently promote bacterial pathogenesis.
TI  - Surface histidine mutations for the metal affinity purification of a beta-carbonic anhydrase.
AB  - Metal affinity chromatography using polyhistidine tags is a standard laboratory technique for the general purification of proteins from cellular systems, but there have been no attempts to explore whether the surface character of a protein may be engineered to similar affinity. We present the Arg160His mutation of Haemophilus influenzae carbonic anhydrase (HICA), which mimics the endogenous metal affinity of Escherichia coli carbonic anhydrase (ECCA). The purity and activity of the mutant are reported, and the purification is discussed. This is the first step toward developing a general method to engineer surface metal affinity for use in purification and metal labeling techniques.
TI  - Determination of disk diffusion and MIC quality control guidelines for GSK2140944, a novel bacterial type II topoisomerase inhibitor antimicrobial agent.
AB  - GSK2140944 is a novel bacterial type II topoisomerase inhibitor in development for the treatment of conventional and biothreat pathogens, including Gram-positive pathogens and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. This quality control study was performed to establish ranges for selected control strains: S. aureus ATCC 29213 and ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247, and Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619. The control ranges will be crucial for the accurate evaluation of GSK2140944 potency as it progresses through clinical trial development.
TI  - Generalization of entropy based divergence measures for symbolic sequence analysis.
AB  - Entropy based measures have been frequently used in symbolic sequence analysis. A symmetrized and smoothed form of Kullback-Leibler divergence or relative entropy, the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD), is of particular interest because of its sharing properties with families of other divergence measures and its interpretability in different domains including statistical physics, information theory and mathematical statistics. The uniqueness and versatility of this measure arise because of a number of attributes including generalization to any number of probability distributions and association of weights to the distributions. Furthermore, its entropic formulation allows its generalization in different statistical frameworks, such as, non-extensive Tsallis statistics and higher order Markovian statistics. We revisit these generalizations and propose a new generalization of JSD in the integrated Tsallis and Markovian statistical framework. We show that this generalization can be interpreted in terms of mutual information. We also investigate the performance of different JSD generalizations in deconstructing chimeric DNA sequences assembled from bacterial genomes including that of E. coli, S. enterica typhi, Y. pestis and H. influenzae. Our results show that the JSD generalizations bring in more pronounced improvements when the sequences being compared are from phylogenetically proximal organisms, which are often difficult to distinguish because of their compositional similarity. While small but noticeable improvements were observed with the Tsallis statistical JSD generalization, relatively large improvements were observed with the Markovian generalization. In contrast, the proposed Tsallis-Markovian generalization yielded more pronounced improvements relative to the Tsallis and Markovian generalizations, specifically when the sequences being compared arose from phylogenetically proximal organisms.
TI  - Activation of innate immune responses by Haemophilus influenzae lipooligosaccharide.
AB  - A Gram-negative pathogen Haemophilus influenzae has a truncated endotoxin known as lipooligosaccharide (LOS). Recent studies on H. influenzae LOS highlighted its structural and compositional implications for bacterial virulence; however, the role of LOS in the activation of innate and adaptive immunity is poorly understood. THP-1 monocytes were stimulated with either lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli or LOS compounds derived from H. influenzae Eagan, Rd, and Rd lic1 lpsA strains. Cell surface expression of key antigen-presenting, costimulatory, and adhesion molecules, as well as gene expression of some cytokines and pattern recognition receptors, were studied. Eagan and Rd LOS had a lower capacity to induce the expression of ICAM-1, CD40, CD58, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) compared to LPS. In contrast, antigen-presenting (HLA-ABC or HLA-DR) and costimulatory (CD86) molecules and NOD2 were similarly upregulated in response to LOS and LPS. LOS from a mutant Rd strain (Rd lic1 lpsA) consistently induced higher expression of innate immune molecules than the wild-type LOS, suggesting the importance of phosphorylcholine and/or oligosaccharide extension in cellular responses to LOS. An LOS compound with a strong ability to upregulate antigen-presenting and costimulatory molecules combined with a low proinflammatory activity may be considered a vaccine candidate to immunize against H. influenzae.
TI  - A fine-tuned interaction between trimeric autotransporter haemophilus surface fibrils and vitronectin leads to serum resistance and adherence to respiratory epithelial cells.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) escapes the host immune system by recruitment of the complement regulator vitronectin, which inhibits the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) by inhibiting C5b-C7 complex formation and C9 polymerization. We reported previously that Hib acquires vitronectin at the surface by using Haemophilus surface fibrils (Hsf). Here we studied in detail the interaction between Hsf and vitronectin and its role in the inhibition of MAC formation and the invasion of lung epithelial cells. The vitronectin-binding region of Hsf was defined at the N-terminal region comprising Hsf amino acids 429 to 652. Moreover, the Hsf recognition site on vitronectin consisted of the C-terminal amino acids 352 to 374. H. influenzae was killed more rapidly in vitronectin-depleted serum than in normal human serum (NHS), and increased MAC deposition was observed at the surface of an Hsf-deficient H. influenzae mutant. In parallel, Hsf-expressing Escherichia coli selectively acquired vitronectin from serum, resulting in significant inhibition of the MAC. Moreover, when vitronectin was bound to Hsf, increased bacterial adherence and internalization into epithelial cells were observed. Taking our findings together, we have defined a fine-tuned protein-protein interaction between Hsf and vitronectin that may contribute to increased Hib virulence.
TI  - The challenges and successes of implementing a sustainable antimicrobial resistance surveillance programme in Nepal.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global public health concern and its surveillance is a fundamental tool for monitoring the development of AMR. In 1998, the Nepalese Ministry of Health (MOH) launched an Infectious Disease (ID) programme. The key components of the programme were to establish a surveillance programme for AMR and to develop awareness among physicians regarding AMR and rational drug usage in Nepal. METHODS: An AMR surveillance programme was established and implemented by the Nepalese MOH in partnership with the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR, B) from 1998 to 2003. From 2004 to 2012, the programme was integrated and maintained as a core activity of the National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL) and resulted in an increased number of participating laboratories and pathogens brought under surveillance. The main strategies were to build national capacity on isolation, identification and AMR testing of bacterial pathogens, establish laboratory networking and an External Quality Assessment (EQA) programme, promote standardised recording and reporting of results, and to ensure timely analysis and dissemination of data for advocacy and national policy adaptations. The programme was initiated by nine participating laboratories performing AMR surveillance on Vibrio cholerae, Shigella spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. RESULTS: The number of participating laboratories was ultimately increased to 13 and the number of pathogens under surveillance was increased to seven (Salmonella spp. was added to the surveillance programme in 2002 and extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli in 2011). From 1999 to 2012, data were available on 17,103 bacterial isolates. During the AMR programme, we observed changing trends in serovars/species for Salmonella spp., Shigella spp. and V. cholerae and changing AMR trend for all organisms. Notably, N. gonorrhoeae isolates demonstrated increasing resistance to ciprofloxacin. Additionally, the performance of the participating laboratories improved as shown by annual EQA data evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: This Nepalese AMR programme continues and serves as a model for sustainable surveillance of AMR monitoring in resource limited settings.
TI  - [In vitro activity of sitafloxacin against clinical isolates in 2012].
AB  - In vitro activity of sitafloxacin (STFX) and various oral antimicrobial agents against bacterial isolates recovered from clinical specimens between January and December 2012, at different healthcare facilities in Japan was evaluated. A total of 1,620 isolates including aerobic and anaerobic organisms were available for the susceptibility testing using the microbroth dilution methods recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The minimum inhibitory concentration of STFX at which 90% of isolates (MIC90) was 0.5 microg/mL for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and was 2 times lower than that of garenoxacin (GRNX), 4 times lower than that of moxifloxacin (MFLX), and 16 times lower than that of levofloxacin (LVFX). STFX inhibited the growth of all the isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 microg/mL or less. The MIC90 of STFX was 0.03 microg/mL and was 2 times lower than that of GRNX, 4 times lower than that of MFLX, and 32 times lower than that of LVFX. Against Streptococcus pyogenes, the MIC90 of STFX was 0.06 microg/mL and was 2 times lower than that of GRNX, 8 times lower than that of MFLX, and 32 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX was 2 microg/mL for Enterococcus faecalis, and was 4 times lower than that of GRNX, 8 times lower than that of MFLX, and 32 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX for Escherichia coli was 2 microg/mL, and the MIC90(s) of other 10 species of Enterobacteriaceae which were the lowest values of the quinolones tested ranged from 0.03 to 1 microg/mL. The MIC90 of STFX for Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates recovered from urinary infections was 4 microg/mL and was 32 times lower than those of GRNX, MFLX and LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX for P. aeruginosa isolates recovered from respiratory infections was 4 microg/mL and was 8 to 16 times lower than those of GRNX, MFLX, and LVFX. STFX inhibited the growth of all the isolates of Haemophilus influenzae at 0.004 microg/mL or less, and was 4 times lower than that of GRNX, 16 times lower than that of MFLX, and 8 times lower than that of LVFX. The MIC90 of STFX was 0.015 microg/mL for Moraxella catarrhalis, and was equal to that of GRNX, 4 times lower than those of MFLX and LVFX. The MIC90(s) of STFX ranged from 0.03 to 0.25 microg/mL for all the species of anaerobic bacteria and were the lowest values of all the antimicrobial agents tested. In conclusion, the activity of STFX against Gram-positive cocci was comparable or superior to those of GRNX, MFLX and LVFX. STFX showed the most potent activity against Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobic bacteria of all the antimicrobial agents tested in this study.
TI  - Ceftaroline activity against organisms isolated from respiratory tract infections in USA hospitals: results from the AWARE Program, 2009-2011.
AB  - The Assessing Worldwide Antimicrobial Resistance Evaluation Program monitors the  activity of ceftaroline and comparator agents tested against pathogens causing either respiratory or skin and soft tissue infections. A total of 7733 isolates from patients in 80 medical centers across the United States (USA) identified as respiratory tract pathogens by the infection type and/or specimen site recorded by the submitting laboratory during 2009-2011 were evaluated. There were 3360 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1799 Haemophilus influenzae, 1087 Staphylococcus aureus, 678 Moraxella catarrhalis, 459 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 223 Escherichia coli, and 127 Klebsiella oxytoca. Annual penicillin resistance among S. pneumoniae ranged from 21.9 to 24.3%. All S. pneumoniae strains were inhibited at a ceftaroline MIC of </=0.5 mug/mL with 100.0% of isolates categorized as susceptible. Ceftaroline was 16-fold more active than ceftriaxone and 32-fold more active than amoxicillin-clavulanate against penicillin-resistant pneumococci. Only 49.8% of the penicillin-resistant isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone. There were a total of 1087 S. aureus (48.9% methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA]) isolates, and the yearly MRSA rate ranged from 47.9 to 49.7%. The ceftaroline MIC50/90 for S. aureus was at 0.25/1 mug/mL; 98.2% susceptible and no resistant strains (>/=4 mug/mL). Ceftaroline activity against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates (MIC50 and MIC90, 0.25 and 0.25 mug/mL, respectively; 100% susceptible) was 2- to 4-fold greater than for MRSA (MIC50/90, 0.5/1 mug/mL; 96.2% susceptible). The ceftriaxone MIC90 for MSSA was 4 mug/mL. Ceftaroline was active against H. influenzae (MIC50/90 </=0.015/0.03 mug/mL; 100.0% susceptible) and against M. catarrhalis (MIC50/90, 0.06/0.12 mug/mL). Ceftaroline was active against non-extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotype strains of Enterobacteriaceae but not against ESBL-positive phenotype strains. In summary, ceftaroline was highly active against a large collection of bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with respiratory tract infections in the USA during 2009 through 2011.
TI  - Antibodies to the HMW1/HMW2 and Hia adhesins of nontypeable haemophilus influenzae mediate broad-based opsonophagocytic killing of homologous and heterologous strains.
AB  - The HMW1/HMW2 and Hia proteins are highly immunogenic surface adhesins of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi). Approximately 75% of NTHi strains express HMW1/HMW2 adhesins, and most of the remaining 25% express an Hia adhesin. Our objective in this study was to assess the ability of antisera raised against purified HMW1/HMW2 proteins or recombinant Hia proteins to mediate opsonophagocytic killing of a large panel of unrelated NTHi strains. Native HMW1/HMW2 proteins were purified from three HMW1/HMW2-expressing NTHi strains. Recombinant fusion proteins expressing surface-exposed segments of either of two prototype Hia proteins were purified from Escherichia coli transformants. Immune sera raised in guinea pigs were assessed for their ability to mediate killing of NTHi in an opsonophagocytic assay with the HL-60 phagocytic cell line. The three HMW1/HMW2 antisera mediated killing of 22 of 65, 43 of 65, and 28 of 65 unrelated HMW1/HMW2-expressing NTHi strains, respectively. As a group, the three sera mediated killing of 48 of 65 HMW1/HMW2-expressing strains. The two Hia immune sera mediated killing of 12 of 24 and 13 of 24 unrelated Hia-expressing NTHi strains, respectively. Together, they mediated killing of 15 of 24 Hia-expressing strains. Neither the HMW1/HMW2 nor the Hia antisera mediated killing of NTHi expressing the alternative adhesin type. Antibodies directed against native HMW1/HMW2 proteins and recombinant Hia proteins are capable of mediating broad-based opsonophagocytic killing of homologous and heterologous NTHi strains. A vaccine formulated with a limited number of HMW1/HMW2 and Hia proteins might provide protection against disease caused by most NTHi strains.
TI  - Selection against glycosylation sites in potential target proteins of the general HMWC N-glycosyltransferase in Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The HMWABC system of non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) encodes the HMWA  adhesin glycoprotein, which is glycosylated by the HMWC glycosyltransferase. HMWC is a cytoplasmic N-glycosyltransferase, homologues of which are widespread in the Pasteurellaceae. We developed an assay for nonbiased detection of glycoproteins in NTHi based on metabolic engineering of the Leloir pathway and growth in media containing radiolabelled monosaccharides. The only glycoprotein identified in NTHi by this assay was HMWA. However, glycoproteomic analyses ex vivo in Escherichia coli showed that HMWC of NTHi was a general glycosyltransferase capable of glycosylating selected asparagines in proteins other than its HMWA substrate, including Asn78 in E. coli 30S ribosomal protein S5. The equivalent residue in S5 homologues in H. influenzae or other sequenced Pasteurellaceae genomes is not asparagine, and these organisms also showed significantly fewer than expected potential sites of glycosylation in general. Expression of active HMWC in E. coli resulted in growth inhibition compared with expression of inactive enzyme, consistent with glycosylation by HMWC detrimentally affecting the function of some E. coli proteins. Together, this supports the presence of a selective pressure in the Pasteurellaceae against glycosylation sites that would be modified by the general N-glycosyltransferase activity of HMWC.
TI  - Ceftaroline activity tested against contemporary Latin American bacterial pathogens (2011).
AB  - A total of 2484 target bacterial pathogens were collected (one per patient episode) from patients in 16 Latin American medical centers located in seven nations during 2011. Isolate identity was confirmed at a coordinating laboratory and susceptibility testing was performed for ceftaroline and comparator agents according to reference broth microdilution methods. A total of 30.0% of isolates were from respiratory tract, 29.4% from skin and skin structure, 21.4% from blood stream, 7.9% from urinary tract and 11.3% from other sites. Ceftaroline was active against Staphylococcus aureus (42.8% MRSA) with 83.6% of the isolates at </= 1 mg/L and all isolates at </= 2 mg/L (MIC5090, 0.25/2mg/L). National MRSA rates ranged from a low of 28.8% in Colombia to a high of 68.1% in Chile. All Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC50/90 values were at </= 0.015/</= 0.015 mg/L for both). All Streptococcus pneumoniae were susceptible to ceftaroline, linezolid, tigecycline and vancomycin. Susceptibility to ceftriaxone was at 88.4% (CLSI non-meningitis interpretive criteria) and 73.9% (CLSI meningitis interpretive criteria) for all S. pneumoniae. Ceftriaxone susceptibility was only at 33.3% (CLSI non-meningitis interpretive criteria) and 0.0% (CLSI meningitis interpretive criteria) for penicillin-intermediate (penicillin MIC, 4 mg/L) strains. All Haemophilus influenzae (29.4% beta-lactamase-positive) isolates were susceptible to ceftaroline, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin. For the Latin American region, the ESBL-phenotype rate was 37.6% for Escherichia coli and 53.3% for Klebsiella pneumoniae. Ceftaroline was not active against ESBL-phenotype strains but was active against >90.0% of the non-ESBL-phenotype. The spectrum of activity of ceftaroline against pathogens from Latin America indicates that it merits further study for its potential use in the Latin American region.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-negative organisms isolated from patients hospitalized in intensive care units in United States and European hospitals (2009-2011).
AB  - Treatment of infections in the intensive care unit (ICU) represents a great challenge, especially those caused by Gram-negative organisms. Rapid introduction of appropriate antimicrobial therapy is crucial to reduce mortality; resistance rates in the ICU can be elevated due to antimicrobial selection pressure. We evaluated the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients hospitalized in ICUs (ICU patients). The isolates were consecutively collected as part of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program from January 2009 to December 2011 and tested for susceptibility to multiple antimicrobial agents at a central laboratory by reference broth microdilution methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility results for 5989 bacterial isolates from ICU patients (3445 from the United States [USA] and 2544 from Europe [EU]) were analyzed and compared to those of 17,244 organisms from non-ICU patients (9271 from USA and 7973 from EU). Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most frequently isolated organisms from ICU patients, followed by Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter spp., and Proteus mirabilis. Susceptibility rates were generally lower among ICU isolates compared to non-ICU organisms. E. coli isolates from ICU patients exhibited elevated extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-phenotype rates (13.7% in USA and 16.6% in EU); furthermore, only amikacin (90.5-94.8% susceptibility), colistin (99.8-100.0% inhibited at </=2 mug/mL), imipenem (95.5-96.0%), meropenem (95.4-95.8%), and tigecycline (96.3-98.0%) exhibited good activity against Klebsiella spp. ESBL-phenotype rates have increased among both E. coli and Klebsiella spp. from ICU patients in the USA and in Europe, with the most noticeable increase among Klebsiella spp. from Europe (from 27.5% in 2009 to 41.8% in 2011; P = 0.015 and odds ratio = 0.89 [95% confidence interval, 1.13-3.18]). Meropenem susceptibility among Klebsiella spp. improved slightly in the USA but decreased markedly in Europe from 100.0% in 2009 to 89.7% in 2011. Only colistin (99.4% susceptible) and amikacin (97.3% in USA and 84.9% in EU) exhibited good activity against P. aeruginosa strains from ICU patients. The greatest differences in susceptibility rates between P. aeruginosa strains from ICU and non-ICU patients were observed for the anti-pseudomonal beta-lactams, such as ceftazidime, meropenem, and piperacillin/tazobactam. The results of this study (101 medical centers) highlight major antimicrobial coverage problems and trends in antimicrobial resistance for USA and EU ICU patient isolates.
TI  - HIRA-TAN: a real-time PCR-based system for the rapid identification of causative  agents in pneumonia.
AB  - Identification of the causative pathogen(s) of pneumonia would allow the selection of effective antibiotics and thus reduce the mortality rate and the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens. To identify such pathogens and to obtain these benefits, it is necessary that a clinical test is rapid, accurate, easily performed, and cost-effective. Here, we devised a PCR-based test, named HIRA-TAN, which is able to discriminate therapeutic targets from commensal organisms (e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae) and to detect foreign organisms (e.g. Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Legionella pneumophila) in the sputum. The utility of this system was validated in a prospective study, using sputum samples from patients with pneumonia. 568 patients were enrolled and the HIRA-TAN assay identified the causative pathogens with an accuracy of 96.7% for H. influenzae; 93.2% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 80.6% for Klebsiella pneumoniae; 90.9% for Moraxella catarrhalis; 87.5% for Escherichia coli; 78.1% for MRSA and 91.6% for S. pneumoniae. Overall the HIRA-TAN procedure was able to identify the causative pathogens of pneumonia in 60% of the cases. Additionally, this procedure was able to determine when the pneumonia-causing organism was a commensal organism or a foreign organism in a single assay. The HIRA-TAN approach yielded reproducible results and provided valuable information to plan the course of treatment of pneumonia. Through the rapid identification of the causative pathogens, the HIRA-TAN will promote targeted treatments for pneumonias. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: UMIN000001694.
TI  - Prevalence, distribution and transfer of small beta-lactamase-containing plasmids in Swedish Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The beta-lactamase genes of Haemophilus influenzae are commonly positioned on large integrative and conjugative elements, but a group of blaTEM-carrying small plasmids (4000-6000 bp) with a common structural backbone have recently been characterized. In this study we investigated the epidemiological significance and potential for transfer of this group of small plasmids. METHODS: We developed a two-step PCR assay to screen for and type this group of resistance plasmids in H. influenzae. A large collection of respiratory isolates (n = 2845) from south Sweden, obtained from 2009 to 2011, as well as a collection of invasive Swedish H. influenzae from 1997 to 2010 (n = 310) was screened. The distribution of plasmid types among clinical isolates was investigated using multilocus sequence typing (MLST). RESULTS: In the collection, 15.8% of beta-lactamase-producing isolates and 1.4% of total isolates possessed a small plasmid with the signature structure. The plasmids were genetically conserved and widely spread geographically. MLST revealed that the spread of small plasmids occurred by both clonal expansion and horizontal transfer. In vitro experiments suggested that one plasmid type, pN223, can transfer ampicillin resistance to susceptible Escherichia coli. CONCLUSIONS: Small beta-lactamase-encoding plasmids constitute a significant mechanism for beta-lactam resistance in H. influenzae and can spread through clonal expansion of resistant clones as well as through horizontal plasmid transfer.
TI  - The emerging physiological roles of the glycerophosphodiesterase family.
AB  - The glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterases are evolutionarily conserved proteins that have been linked to several patho/physiological functions, comprising bacterial pathogenicity and mammalian cell proliferation or differentiation. The bacterial enzymes do not show preferential substrate selectivities among the glycerophosphodiesters, and they are mainly dedicated to glycerophosphodiester hydrolysis, producing glycerophosphate and alcohols as the building blocks that are required for bacterial biosynthetic pathways. In some cases, this enzymatic activity has been demonstrated to contribute to bacterial pathogenicity, such as with Hemophilus influenzae. Mammalian glyerophosphodiesterases have high substrate specificities, even if the number of potential physiological substrates is continuously increasing. Some of these mammalian enzymes have been directly linked to cell differentiation, such as GDE2, which triggers motor neuron differentiation, and GDE3, the enzymatic activity of which is necessary and sufficient to induce osteoblast differentiation. Instead, GDE5 has been shown to inhibit skeletal muscle development independent of its enzymatic activity.
TI  - Structure of the secretion domain of HxuA from Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae HxuA is a cell-surface protein with haem-haemopexin binding activity which is key to haem acquisition from haemopexin and thus is one of the potential sources of haem for this microorganism. HxuA is secreted by its specific transporter HxuB. HxuA/HxuB belongs to the so-called two-partner secretion systems (TPSs) that are characterized by a conserved N-terminal domain in the secreted protein which is essential for secretion. Here, the 1.5 A resolution structure of the secretion domain of HxuA, HxuA301, is reported. The structure reveals that HxuA301 folds into a beta-helix domain with two extra-helical motifs, a four-stranded beta-sheet and an N-terminal cap. Comparisons with other structures of TpsA secretion domains are reported. They reveal that despite limited sequence identity, strong structural similarities are found between the beta-helix motifs, consistent with the idea that the TPS domain plays a role not only in the interaction with the specific TpsB partners but also as the scaffold initiating progressive folding of the TpsA proteins at the bacterial surface.
TI  - KpsC and KpsS are retaining 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) transferases involved in synthesis of bacterial capsules.
AB  - Capsular polysaccharides (CPSs) are high-molecular-mass cell-surface polysaccharides, that act as important virulence factors for many pathogenic bacteria. Several clinically important Gram-negative pathogens share similar systems for CPS biosynthesis and export; examples include Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Pasteurella multocida. Each CPS contains a serotype-specific repeat-unit structure, but the glycans all possess a lipid moiety at their reducing termini. In E. coli and N. meningitidis, the predominant lipid is a lysophosphatidylglycerol moiety that is attached to the repeat-unit domain of the CPS via multiple residues of 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo), referred to as a poly-Kdo linker. The Kdo residues are beta-linked, suggesting that they are synthesized by retaining glycosyltransferases. To date, the only characterized Kdo transferases are the inverting enzymes that catalyze the alpha-linkages found in lipopolysaccharide. Here, we identify two conserved proteins from CPS assembly systems, KpsC and KpsS, as the beta-Kdo-transferases and demonstrate in vitro reconstitution of poly-Kdo linker assembly on a fluorescent phosphatidylglycerol acceptor. KpsS adds the first Kdo residue, and this reaction product is then extended by KpsC. Cross-complementation experiments demonstrate that the E. coli and N. meningitidis protein homologs are functionally conserved.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of omadacycline, a novel aminomethylcycline.
AB  - Omadacycline is the first intravenous and oral 9-aminomethylcycline in clinical development for use against multiple infectious diseases including acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI), community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP), and urinary tract infections (UTI). The comparative in vitro activity of omadacycline was determined against a broad panel of Gram-positive clinical isolates, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), Lancefield groups A and B beta-hemolytic streptococci, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), and Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae). The omadacycline MIC90s for MRSA, VRE, and beta-hemolytic streptococci were 1.0 mug/ml, 0.25 mug/ml, and 0.5 mug/ml, respectively, and the omadacycline MIC90s for PRSP and H. influenzae were 0.25 mug/ml and 2.0 mug/ml, respectively. Omadacycline was active against organisms demonstrating the two major mechanisms of resistance, ribosomal protection and active tetracycline efflux. In vivo efficacy of omadacycline was demonstrated using an intraperitoneal infection model in mice. A single intravenous dose of omadacycline exhibited efficacy against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus, including tet(M) and tet(K) efflux-containing strains and MRSA strains. The 50% effective doses (ED50s) for Streptococcus pneumoniae obtained ranged from 0.45 mg/kg to 3.39 mg/kg, the ED50s for Staphylococcus aureus obtained ranged from 0.30 mg/kg to 1.74 mg/kg, and the ED50 for Escherichia coli was 2.02 mg/kg. These results demonstrate potent in vivo efficacy including activity against strains containing common resistance determinants. Omadacycline demonstrated in vitro activity against a broad range of Gram-positive and select Gram-negative pathogens, including resistance determinant-containing strains, and this activity translated to potent efficacy in vivo.
TI  - Structure of MurNAc 6-phosphate hydrolase (MurQ) from Haemophilus influenzae with a bound inhibitor.
AB  - The breakdown and recycling of peptidoglycan, an essential polymeric cell structure, occur in a number of bacterial species. A key enzyme in the recycling pathway of one of the components of the peptidoglycan layer, N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc), is MurNAc 6-phosphate hydrolase (MurQ). This enzyme catalyzes the cofactor-independent cleavage of a relatively nonlabile ether bond and presents an interesting target for mechanistic studies. Open chain product and substrate analogues were synthesized and tested as competitive inhibitors (K(is) values of 1.1 +/- 0.3 and 0.23 +/- 0.02 mM, respectively) of the MurNAc 6P hydrolase from Escherichia coli (MurQ-EC). To identify the roles of active site residues that are important for catalysis, the substrate analogue was cocrystallized with the MurNAc 6P hydrolase from Haemophilus influenzae (MurQ-HI) that was amenable to crystallographic studies. The cocrystal structure of MurQ-HI with the substrate analogue showed that Glu89 was located in the proximity of both the C2 atom and the oxygen at the C3 position of the bound inhibitor and that no other potential acid/base residue that could act as an active site acid/base was located in the vicinity. The conserved residues Glu120 and Lys239 were found within hydrogen bonding distance of the C5 hydroxyl group and C6 phosphate group, suggesting that they play a role in substrate binding and ring opening. Combining these results with previous biochemical data, we propose a one-base mechanism of action in which Glu89 functions to both deprotonate at the C2 position and assist in the departure of the lactyl ether at the C3 position. This same residue would serve to deprotonate the incoming water and reprotonate the enolate in the second half of the catalytic cycle.
TI  - Neisseria gonorrhoeae filamentous phage NgoPhi6 is capable of infecting a variety of Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - We constructed a phagemid consisting of the whole genome of the Neisseria gonorrhoeae bacteriophage NgoPhi6 cloned into a pBluescript plasmid derivative lacking the f1 origin of replication (named pBS::Phi6). Escherichia coli cells harboring pBS::Phi6 were able to produce a biologically active phagemid, NgoPhi6fm, capable of infecting, integrating its DNA into the chromosome of, and producing progeny phagemids in, a variety of taxonomically distant Gram-negative bacteria, including E. coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria sicca, Pseudomonas sp., and Paracoccus methylutens. A derivative of pBS::Phi6 lacking the phage orf7 gene, a positional homolog of filamentous phage proteins that mediate the interaction between the phage and the bacterial pilus, was capable of producing phagemid particles that were able to infect E. coli, Haemophilus influenzae, N. sicca, Pseudomonas sp., and Paracoccus methylutens, indicating that NgoPhi6 infects cells of these species using a mechanism that does not involve the Orf7 gene product and that NgoPhi6 initiates infection through a novel process in these species. We further demonstrate that the establishment of the lysogenic state does not require an active phage integrase. Since phagemid particles were capable of infecting diverse hosts, this indicates that NgoPhi6 is the first broad-host-range filamentous bacteriophage described.
TI  - Activity of the antiseptic polyhexanide against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The activity of the antiseptic polyhexanide was tested against 250 gram-negative  clinical isolates, that is, 50 isolates each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were determined by using a serial broth microdilution technique according to DIN 58940. Time-kill studies were performed for reference stains E. coli ATCC 25922, K. pneumoniae ATCC 4352, P. aeruginosa ATCC 15442, M. catarrhalis ATCC 43617, and H. influenzae ATCC 49247. All tested isolates had MICs and MBCs within a range of 1-32 mg/L and were regarded as susceptible to polyhexanide. The highest values were found for P. aeruginosa and H. influenzae with MICs and MBCs of 32 mg/L. Addition of up to 4% albumin to the test medium did not change MICs and MBCs. Time-kill studies of the reference strains showed reduction rates from 3 log10 colony forming units (CFU)/ml to more than 5 log10 CFU/ml for 200 and 400 mg/L polyhexanide within 5-30 min. Testing of polyhexanide in combination with antibiotics showed indifference with amoxicillin, cefotaxime, imipenem, gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin; no antagonism was found. As no resistance and no antagonism with antibiotics were detected, polyhexanide is regarded as suitable agent for topical eradication of gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Evolving trends of neonatal and childhood bacterial meningitis in northern Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of bacterial meningitis varies in different areas, age groups, and times. To know the trend of neonatal and childhood bacterial meningitis in northern Taiwan, we performed this 29-year-long assessment. METHODS: Eligible patients were aged 18 years or younger, hospitalized in Mackay Memorial Hospital between 1984 and 2012, and proven by positive cerebrospinal fluid bacterial cultures. Analysis included the patient numbers and pathogens in different age groups, periods, complications, and outcomes. RESULTS: Males were predominant in all the age groups through the years. Almost half of the patients were in the neonatal period. Patient numbers went up in the early study period and declined after 1993-1997. Group B Streptococcus and Escherichia coli were the most common pathogens in neonates, whereas in childhood were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). Patient numbers of Group B Streptococcus, S. pneumoniae, and Hib meningitis declined in the late study period, but E. coli meningitis increased. The mortality rate decreased but sequela rate increased. Among the four most common pathogens, S. pneumoniae had the worst outcome and had highest mortality rate. All Hib meningitis patients survived, but their sequela rate was the highest. CONCLUSION: This study provides an epidemiological data on trends of neonatal and childhood bacterial meningitis in northern Taiwan during the past 29 years, including male and neonatal predominance, decrease of total patient number in recent years, change of major pathogens, and declined mortality but raised morbidity.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity for clinical isolates from pediatric patients of clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (1: 14) -outcomes of special drug use investigation on antibacterial activity (annual changes)].
AB  - As a special drug use investigation, we monitored and assessed trends in antibacterial activity of clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (1:14) (hereafter, "CVA/AMPC (1:14)") and other antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates from pediatric patients with otitis media or respiratory, skin, and urinary tract infections. Against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis isolated and identified from otorrhea, epipharynx and rhinorrhea of pediatric patients with otitis media, the MIC90s of CVA/AMPC (1:14) in five years between 2006-2010 were 1 microg/mL for S. pneumoniae and 8 microg/mL for H. influenzae and 0.25-0.5microg/mL for M catarrhalis. The changes of MIC90s of CVA/AMPC (1:14) for penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) and beta-lactamase non-producing H. influenzae were two times, and no decrease in drug susceptibility was found in the period of the present investigation. In addition, the MIC changes of other antimicrobial agents for these three organisms were approximately two to four times as well. Against organisms isolated and identified from pus, sputum, pharynx, skin and urine of pediatric patients with respiratory, skin, and urinary tract infections, the MIC90s of CVA/AMPC (1:14) in four years between 2008-2011 were 1 microg/mL for S. pneumoniae, < or =0.06microg/mL for penicillin susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP) without any change, 0.5-1 microg/mL for penicillin intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP) with a twofold change and 1 microg/mL for PRSP with no change. The MIC90s of CVA/AMPC (1:14) were 2-8 microg/mL for S. aureus with a fourfold change, 2 microg/mL for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus without any change, 4-8 microg/mL for H. influenzae with a twofold change. Against beta-lactamase non-producing H. influenzae, MIC90s of CVA/AMPC (1:14) were 1 microg/mL for beta-lactamase negative ampicillin susceptible (BLNAS), 8 microg/mL for beta-lactamase negative ampicillin resistant (BLNAR), showing no change. Neither Streptococcus pyogenes or Klebsiella pneumoniae demonstrated any change and M. catarrhalis and Escherichia coli showed twofold changes of MIC90s of CVA/AMPC (1: 14). In the present investigation conducted to monitor annual changes in antibacterial activity intended for pediatric patients with otitis media or other infections, there was no significant change in antibacterial activity of CVA/AMPC (1: 14).
TI  - Untangling structure-function relationships in the rhomboid family of intramembrane proteases.
AB  - Rhomboid proteases are a family of integral membrane proteins that have been implicated in critical regulatory roles in a wide array of cellular processes and signaling events. The determination of crystal structures of the prokaryotic rhomboid GlpG from Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae has ushered in an era of unprecedented understanding into molecular aspects of intramembrane proteolysis by this fascinating class of protein. A combination of structural studies by X-ray crystallography, and biophysical and spectroscopic analyses, combined with traditional enzymatic and functional analysis has revealed fundamental aspects of rhomboid structure, substrate recognition and the catalytic mechanism. This review summarizes these remarkable advances by examining evidence for the proposed catalytic mechanism derived from inhibitor co-crystal structures, conflicting models of rhomboid-substrate interaction, and recent work on the structure and function of rhomboid cytosolic domains. In addition to exploring progress on aspects of rhomboid structure, areas for future research and unaddressed questions are emphasized and highlighted. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Intramembrane Proteases.
TI  - Superior sensitivity and decreased time to detection with the Bactec Peds Plus/F  system compared to the BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN blood culture system.
AB  - Here, we compare the sensitivities and times to detection (TTD) of BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN (PF) and Bactec Peds Plus blood culture bottles. Test bottles were inoculated with 2 ml of banked whole blood, 1-ml aliquots of antibiotic suspension, and organisms diluted to simulate a bacteremia level of 10 to 100 CFU/ml. The control bottles were inoculated with 3 ml of banked blood and organism suspensions only. The organism-drug combinations were Staphylococcus epidermidis and vancomycin, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin, Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone, Streptococcus agalactiae, ampicillin, and cefotaxime, Escherichia coli, cefotaxime, and cefepime, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, and gentamicin, Neisseria meningitidis and ceftriaxone, and Haemophilus influenzae and ceftriaxone. The control and test bottle combinations were tested in duplicate. The bottles were incubated for 5 days; 32 control and 104 test bottles were incubated. Overall, the bacterial recovery rates for the PF and Peds Plus bottles were 37% and 62%, 94% and 100% in the controls, 19% and 50% in the test bottles, and 33% and 92% in the bottles with vancomycin, respectively. No bacteria were recovered from the bottles with S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, E. coli, N. meningitidis, or H. influenzae in combination with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. The Peds Plus system detected P. aeruginosa in bottles with cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam, but the PF system recovered bacteria only in bottles with trough levels of piperacillin-tazobactam. The mean TTD were shorter in the Peds Plus system controls (14.2 versus 18.0 h; P = 0.001) and the test bottles (14.3 versus 17.8 h; P = 0.008) than in the PF bottles. Overall, we demonstrated superior sensitivity, TTD, and antibiotic neutralization in the Bactec Peds Plus system compared to those in the Pediatric FAN system.
TI  - [Prokaryotic soluble expression of protein D of Haemophilus influenzae type b].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To express the recombinant D protein in prokaryotic expression system  solubly and make preparation for producing D-carrier conjugate vaccine next step. METHODS: The hpd gene fragment removed of signal peptide from genomic DNA of Hib CMCC was inserted into pET43. 1a. The recombinant plasmid was transformed to competent E. coli BL21 (DE3) for expression under induction of IPTG. The expressed recombination protein was precipitated with ammonium sulfate, purified by DEAE anion exchange column chromatography and identified for reactogenicity by Western Blot. RESULTS: The expressed recombination protein, in a soluble form, constained about 50% of total somatic protein and showed specific reaction with the HIB antisera after preliminary purification. CONCLUSION: The D protein recombined expression plasmid was constructed successfully and expressed D protein in prokaryotic cells in a solube form.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the CANWARD surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 Canadian hospitals from January 2010 to December 2012. In total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method (document M07-A9, 2012), with MICs interpreted by using CLSI breakpoints (document M100-S23, 2013). Ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (MIC90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii, and Haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, C. freundii, and H. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to CLSI MIC interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. Ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of Enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (P. mirabilis) to 54.0% (S. marcescens). All isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates (MIC90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity against staphylococci or streptococci. All isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.03 mug/ml), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. We conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and AmpC-producing E. coli and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.
TI  - Overexpression and Purification of C-terminal Fragment of the Passenger Domain of Hap Protein from Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae in a Highly Optimized Escherichia coli Expression System.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a common cause of respiratory tract disease and initiates infection by colonization in nasopharynx. The Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) Hap adhesin is an auto transporter protein that promotes initial interaction with human epithelial cells. Hap protein contains a 110 kDa internal passenger domain called "HapS" and a 45 kDa C-terminal translocator domain called "Hapbeta". Hap adhesive activity has been recently reported to be connected to its Cell Binding Domain (CBD) which resides within the 311 C-terminal residues of the internal passenger domain of the protein. Furthermore, immunization with this CBD protein has been shown to prevent bacterial nasopharynx colonization in animal models. METHODS: To provide enough amounts of pure HapS protein for vaccine studies, we sought to develop a highly optimized system to overexpress and purify the protein in large quantities. To this end, pET24a-cbd plasmid harboring cbd sequence from NTHi ATCC49766 was constructed and its expression was optimized by testing various expression parameters such as growth media, induction temperature, IPTG inducer concentration, induction stage and duration. SDS-PAGE and Western-blotting were used for protein analysis and confirmation and eventually the expressed protein was easily purified via immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) using Ni-NTA columns. RESULTS: The highest expression level of target protein was achieved when CBD expressing E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were grown at 37 degrees C in 2xTY medium with 1.0 mM IPTG at mid-log phase (OD600 nm equal to 0.6) for 5 hrs. Amino acid sequence alignment of expressed CBD protein with 3 previously published CBD amino acid sequences were more than %97 identical and antigenicity plot analysis further revealed 9 antigenic domains which appeared to be well conserved among different analyzed CBD sequences. CONCLUSION: Due to the presence of high similarity among CBD from NTHi ATCC49766 and other NTHi strains, CBD protein expressed here sounds to be theoretically ideal as a universal candidate for being used in vaccine studies against NTHi strains of various geographical areas. Further investigations to corroborate the potency of this protein as a vaccine candidate are under process.
TI  - Spectrum and potency of ceftaroline against leading pathogens causing community-acquired respiratory tract and skin and soft tissue infections in Latin America, 2010.
AB  - Ceftaroline, the active metabolite of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, is a cephalosporin with in vitro bactericidal activity against Gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic and viridans group streptococci, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as common Gram-negative organisms. In this study a total of 986 isolates collected in 2010 from patients in 15 medical centers in five Latin American countries from the Assessing Worldwide Antimicrobial Resistance Evaluation Program were identified as community-acquired respiratory tract or skin and soft tissue infection pathogens. Ceftaroline was the most potent agent tested against S. pneumoniae with a MIC90 value (0.12mug/mL) that was eight-fold lower than ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and linezolid. Its spectrum of coverage (100.0% susceptible) was similar to tigecycline, linezolid, levofloxacin and vancomycin. Against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, ceftaroline was the most active agent tested. The activity of ceftaroline against S. aureus (including MRSA) was similar to that of vancomycin and tetracycline (MIC90, 1mug/mL) and linezolid (MIC90, 2mug/mL). The beta-haemolytic streptococci exhibited 100.0% susceptibility to ceftaroline. Ceftaroline activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Enterobacter spp. was similar to that of ceftriaxone and ceftazidime. These parenteral cephalosporin agents have potent activity against non-extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-phenotype strains, but are not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-phenotype strains. These results confirm the in vitro activity of ceftaroline against pathogens common in community-acquired respiratory tract and skin and soft tissue infection in Latin America, and suggest that ceftaroline fosamil could be an important therapeutic option for these infections.
TI  - The UDP-diacylglucosamine pyrophosphohydrolase LpxH in lipid A biosynthesis utilizes Mn2+ cluster for catalysis.
AB  - In Escherichia coli and the majority of beta- and gamma-proteobacteria, the fourth step of lipid A biosynthesis, i.e. cleavage of the pyrophosphate group of UDP-2,3-diacyl-GlcN, is carried out by LpxH. LpxH has been previously suggested to contain signature motifs found in the calcineurin-like phosphoesterase (CLP) family of metalloenzymes; however, it cleaves a pyrophosphate bond instead of a phosphoester bond, and its substrate contains nucleoside diphosphate moieties more common to the Nudix family rather than to the CLP family. Furthermore, the extent of biochemical data fails to demonstrate a significant level of metal activation in enzymatic assays, which is inconsistent with the behavior of a metalloenzyme. Here, we report cloning, purification, and detailed enzymatic characterization of Haemophilus influenzae LpxH (HiLpxH). HiLpxH shows over 600-fold stimulation of hydrolase activity in the presence of Mn(2+). EPR studies reveal the presence of a Mn(2+) cluster in LpxH. Finally, point mutants of residues in the conserved metal-binding motifs of the CLP family greatly inhibit HiLpxH activity, highlighting their importance in enzyme function. Contrary to previous analyses of LpxH, we find HiLpxH does not obey surface dilution kinetics. Overall, our work unambiguously establishes LpxH as a calcineurin-like phosphoesterase containing a Mn(2+) cluster coordinated by conserved residues. These results set the scene for further structural investigation of the enzyme and for design of novel antibiotics targeting lipid A biosynthesis.
TI  - Transport and catabolism of the sialic acids N-glycolylneuraminic acid and 3-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galactonononic acid by Escherichia coli K-12.
AB  - Escherichia coli can transport and catabolize the common sialic acid, N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), as a sole source of carbon and nitrogen, which is an important mucus-derived carbon source in the mammalian gut. Herein we demonstrate that E. coli can also grow efficiently on the related sialic acids, N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) and 3-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galactonononic acid (KDN), which are transported via the sialic acid transporter NanT and catabolized using the sialic acid aldolase NanA. Catabolism of Neu5Gc uses the same pathway as Neu5Ac, likely producing glycolate instead and acetate during its breakdown and catabolism of KDN requires NanA activity, while other components of the Neu5Ac catabolism pathway are non-essential. We also demonstrate that these two sialic acids can support growth of an E. coli nanT strain expressing sialic acid transporters from two bacterial pathogens, namely the tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic transporter SiaPQM from Haemophilus influenzae and the sodium solute symport transporter STM1128 from Salmonella enterica ssp. Typhimurium, suggesting that the ability to use Neu5Gc and KDN in addition to Neu5Ac is present in a number of human pathogens.
TI  - Spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of common pathogenic bacteria isolated from patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in mainland of China.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria-induced respiratory infection has been long considered to be the major cause of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). Therefore, a clear picture about the distribution and drug-resistance of pathogenic bacteria in the lower airways should be helpful for treatment of the disease. So far, data on this topic among Chinese are lacking. METHODS: A surveillance study was performed in consecutive patients with AECOPD at five areas in China between October 2006 and April 2008. The sputum from these patients was cultured and isolated for bacteria. Agar dilution method was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of levofoxacin and other 15 antibiotics against these strains. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty-nine pathogenic bacterial strains were isolated among 884 patients with AECOPD. The predominant bacteria were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.3%), Haemophilus influenzae (14.2%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (11.7%), followed by Haemophilus parainfluenzae (9.5%), Acinetobacter baumannii (7.8%), Moraxella catarrhalis (6.4%) and Escherichia coli (3.6%). The majority of bacterial pathogens isolated in this study were susceptible to fuoroquinolones, ceftazidime, cefepime and imipenem. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-negative bacilli are the leading pathogens in patients with AECOPD in China. Haemophilus parainfluenzae may be one of the most important pathogens in AECOPD. This study provides evidence for local surveillance of AECOPD pathogens and appropriate choice of antimicrobials in China.
TI  - A screening for antimicrobial activities of Caribbean herbal remedies.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The TRAMIL program aims to understand, validate and expand health practices based on the use of medicinal plants in the Caribbean, which is a "biodiversity hotspot" due to high species endemism, intense development pressure and habitat loss. The antibacterial activity was examined for thirteen plant species from several genera that were identified as a result of TRAMIL ethnopharmacological surveys or were reported in ethnobotanical accounts from Puerto Rico. The aim of this study was to validate the traditional use of these plant species for the treatment of bacterial infections, such as conjunctivitis, fever, otitis media and furuncles. METHODS: An agar disc diffusion assay was used to examine five bacterial strains that are associated with the reported infections, including Staphylococcus saprophyticus (ATCC 15305), S. aureus (ATCC 6341), Escherichia coli (ATCC 4157), Haemophilus influenzae (ATCC 8142), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 7700) and Proteus vulgaris (ATCC 6896), as well as the fungus Candida albicans (ATCC 752). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values were determined for each of the extracts that showed inhibitory activity. RESULTS: The decoctions of Pityrogramma calomelanos, Tapeinochilus ananassae, and Syzygium jambos, as well as the juice of Gossypium barbadense, showed > 20% growth inhibition against several bacteria relative to the positive control, which was the antibiotic Streptomycin. Extracts with the best antimicrobial activities were S. jambos that showed MIC = 31 mug/mL and MBC = 1.0 mg/mL against P. vulgaris and T. ananassae that showed MIC = 15 mug/mL against S. aureus. CONCLUSION: This report confirms the traditional use of P. calomelanos for the treatment of kidney infections that are associated with stones, as well as the antimicrobial and bactericidal effects of T. ananassae against P. vulgaris and S. saprophyticus and the effects of S. jambos against S. aureus and S. saprophyticus.
TI  - Dual orientation of the outer membrane lipoprotein P6 of nontypeable haemophilus  influenzae.
AB  - The majority of outer membrane (OM) lipoproteins in Gram-negative bacteria are tethered to the membrane via an attached lipid moiety and oriented facing in toward the periplasmic space; a few lipoproteins have been shown to be surface exposed. The outer membrane lipoprotein P6 from the Gram-negative pathogenic bacterium nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is surface exposed and a leading vaccine candidate for prevention of NTHi infections. However, we recently found that P6 is not a transmembrane protein as previously thought (L. V. Michel, B. Kalmeta, M. McCreary, J. Snyder, P. Craig, M. E. Pichichero, Vaccine 29:1624-1627, 2011). Here we pursued studies to show that P6 has a dual orientation, existing infrequently as surface exposed and predominantly as internally oriented toward the periplasmic space. Flow cytometry using three monoclonal antibodies with specificity for P6 showed surface staining of whole NTHi cells. Confocal microscopy imaging confirmed that antibodies targeted surface-exposed P6 of intact NTHi cells and not internal P6 in membrane-compromised or dead cells. Western blots of two wild-type NTHi strains and a mutant NTHi strain that does not express P6 showed that P6 antibodies do not detect a promiscuous epitope on NTHi. Depletion of targets to nonlipidated P6 significantly decreased bactericidal activity of human serum. Protease digestion of surface-exposed P6 demonstrated that P6 is predominantly internally localized in a manner similar to its homologue Pal in Escherichia coli. We conclude that P6 of NTHi is likely inserted into the OM in two distinct orientations, with the predominant orientation facing in toward the periplasm.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of prulifloxacin in comparison with other fluoroquinolones against community-acquired urinary and respiratory pathogens isolated in Greece.
AB  - Prulifloxacin, the prodrug of ulifloxacin, is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone rather recently introduced in certain European countries. We compared the antimicrobial potency of ulifloxacin with that of other fluoroquinolones against common urinary and respiratory bacterial pathogens. The microbial isolates were prospectively collected between January 2007 and May 2008 from patients with community-acquired infections in Greece. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin (for respiratory isolates only), and ulifloxacin using the E-test method. The binary logarithms of the MICs [log2(MICs)] were compared by using the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test. A total of 409 isolates were studied. Ulifloxacin had the lowest geometric mean MIC for the 161 Escherichia coli, 59 Proteus mirabilis, and 22 Staphylococcus saprophyticus urinary isolates, the second lowest geometric mean MIC for the 38 Streptococcus pyogenes respiratory isolates (after moxifloxacin), and the third lowest geometric mean MIC for the 114 Haemophilus influenzae and the 15 Moraxella catarrhalis respiratory isolates (after ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin). Compared with levofloxacin, ulifloxacin had lower log2(MICs) against E. coli (p < 0.001), P. mirabilis (p < 0.001), S. saprophyticus (p < 0.001), and S. pyogenes (p < 0.001). Compared with ciprofloxacin, ulifloxacin had lower log2(MICs) against P. mirabilis (p < 0.001), S. saprophyticus (p = 0.008), and S. pyogenes (p < 0.001), but higher log2(MICs) against H. influenzae (p < 0.001) and M. catarrhalis (p = 0.001). In comparison with other clinically relevant fluoroquinolones, ulifloxacin had the most potent antimicrobial activity against the community-acquired urinary isolates studied and very good activity against the respiratory isolates.
TI  - Bacterial isolates from cerebrospinal fluid of children with suspected acute meningitis in a Nigerian tertiary hospital.
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the common aetiolog of acute bacterial meningitis in children and their antibiotic susceptibility pattern. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study with a review of cerebrospinal fluid culture reports of paediatric patients aged 0-15 years, suspected of acute meningitis in the Medical Microbiology Department of Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, Kano, Nigeria from October 2006 to October 2009 from October 2006 to October 2009. RESULTS: A positive culture bacterial isolation rate of 3.3% (n=50/1500) with prevalence of Streptococcus pneumoniae (24%), Neisseria meningitidis (22%), Escherichia coli (16%), Haemophilus influenzae (14%), Group B streptococci (8%) and Enterococci (8%) which were susceptible to ceftriaxone (96%), cefotaxime (95%) and ciprofloxacin (93%) across the bacterial isolates. Neonates were 55% (n=6.8/12.4) most at risk. CONCLUSION: Neonates are the most at risk of acute bacterial meningitis. In the absence of antibiotic susceptibility report, ceftriaxone should be considered as a first choice reliable antibiotic for empirical treatment of meningitis in children, in this environment.
TI  - Conserved glycolipid termini in capsular polysaccharides synthesized by ATP-binding cassette transporter-dependent pathways in Gram-negative pathogens.
AB  - Bacterial capsules are surface layers made of long-chain polysaccharides. They are anchored to the outer membrane of many Gram-negative bacteria, including pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pasteurella multocida. Capsules protect pathogens from host defenses including complement-mediated killing and phagocytosis and therefore represent a major virulence factor. Capsular polysaccharides are synthesized by enzymes located in the inner (cytoplasmic) membrane and are then translocated to the cell surface. Whereas the enzymes that synthesize the polysaccharides have been studied in detail, the structure and biosynthesis of the anchoring elements have not been definitively resolved. Here we determine the structure of the glycolipid attached to the reducing terminus of the polysialic acid capsular polysaccharides from E. coli K1 and N. meningitidis group B and the heparosan-like capsular polysaccharide from E. coli K5. All possess the same unique glycolipid terminus consisting of a lyso-phosphatidylglycerol moiety with a beta-linked poly-(3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid) (poly-Kdo) linker attached to the reducing terminus of the capsular polysaccharide.
TI  - A prospective study of the causes of febrile illness requiring hospitalization in children in Cambodia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Febrile illnesses are pre-eminent contributors to morbidity and mortality among children in South-East Asia but the causes are poorly understood. We determined the causes of fever in children hospitalised in Siem Reap province, Cambodia. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A one-year prospective study of febrile children admitted to Angkor Hospital for Children, Siem Reap. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and outcome data were comprehensively analysed. Between October 12(th) 2009 and October 12(th) 2010 there were 1225 episodes of febrile illness in 1180 children. Median (IQR) age was 2.0 (0.8-6.4) years, with 850 (69%) episodes in children <5 years. Common microbiological diagnoses were dengue virus (16.2%), scrub typhus (7.8%), and Japanese encephalitis virus (5.8%). 76 (6.3%) episodes had culture-proven bloodstream infection, including Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (22 isolates, 1.8%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (13, 1.1%), Escherichia coli (8, 0.7%), Haemophilus influenzae (7, 0.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (6, 0.5%) and Burkholderia pseudomallei (6, 0.5%). There were 69 deaths (5.6%), including those due to clinically diagnosed pneumonia (19), dengue virus (5), and melioidosis (4). 10 of 69 (14.5%) deaths were associated with culture-proven bloodstream infection in logistic regression analyses (odds ratio for mortality 3.4, 95% CI 1.6-6.9). Antimicrobial resistance was prevalent, particularly in S. enterica Typhi, (where 90% of isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, and 86% were multi-drug resistant). Comorbid undernutrition was present in 44% of episodes and a major risk factor for acute mortality (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-4.2), as were HIV infection and cardiac disease. CONCLUSION: We identified a microbiological cause of fever in almost 50% of episodes in this large study of community-acquired febrile illness in hospitalized children in Cambodia. The range of pathogens, antimicrobial susceptibility, and co-morbidities associated with mortality described will be of use in the development of rational guidelines for infectious disease treatment and control in Cambodia and South-East Asia.
TI  - Microbiological diagnosis and antibiotic therapy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia and acute COPD exacerbation in daily clinical practice: comparison to current guidelines.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this secondary analysis was to evaluate current microbiological approaches, microbiology, and antibiotic therapy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) in clinical practice and to compare them with current international guidelines. METHODS: A total of 362 patients with suspected CAP were enrolled in 14 European centers in a prospective multicenter study. RESULTS: A total of 279 inpatients (CAP, n = 222; AECOPD, n = 57) were evaluated. A total of 83 (37 %) CAP patients and 25 (44 %) AECOPD patients did not undergo any microbiological tests. In patients with CAP/AECOPD, blood culture was performed in 109 (49 %)/16 (28.1 %), urinary antigen tests for Legionella pneumophila in 67 (30 %)/9 (16 %), and sputum investigation in 55 (25 %)/17 (30 %), respectively. The most frequent pathogens in CAP were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, L. pneumophila, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterobacter cloacae; in AECOPD they were Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. All CAP patients (mean = 11.1 days) and 35 (61.4 %) of AECOPD patients (mean = 8.9 days) received antibiotics. CAP patients were given mostly aminopenicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitors and AECOPD patients were given mostly cephalosporins. CONCLUSIONS: Pathogens isolated in CAP and AECOPD and the antibiotic therapy used are in good accordance with the guidelines. Blood culture, recommended for all CAP patients, was performed in only 50 % of the cases and antibiotic therapy lasted longer than the suggested 5-7 days. Therefore, international guidelines regarding performance of blood culture and duration of antibiotic therapy should be adopted more often. This duration was independent of the number of isolated pathogens and number of symptoms on admission. Therefore, the question arises as to whether microbiological data are necessary only for patients who are resistant to initial therapy.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftaroline and comparator agents tested against bacterial isolates causing skin and soft tissue infections and community-acquired respiratory tract infections isolated from the Asia-Pacific region and South Africa (2010).
AB  - Ceftaroline, the active metabolite of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, is a cephalosporin with in vitro bactericidal activity against resistant Gram-positive organisms including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, and common Gram-negative organisms, including wild-type Enterobacteriaceae. We evaluated the in vitro activity of ceftaroline and selected comparator agents against bacterial isolates collected from patients with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) and community-acquired respiratory tract infections (CARTI) in the Asia-Pacific region and South Africa. A total of 2351 isolates, 1100 from SSTI and 1251 from CARTI, were collected from 25 medical centers distributed across 8 countries as part of the 2010 AWARE ceftaroline surveillance program and tested for susceptibility by reference broth microdilution methods. Ceftaroline was very active against S. aureus (MIC50/90, 0.25/1 mug/mL; 93.4% susceptible), including MRSA (MIC50/90, 1/2 mug/mL; 80.6% susceptible). Against beta-hemolytic streptococci, ceftaroline demonstrated greater activity (MIC90, 0.015 mug/mL) than penicillin (MIC90, 0.06 mug/mL). Ceftaroline was also highly active against viridans group streptococci (MIC90, 0.12 mug/mL). Similarly to ceftriaxone, ceftaroline activity against Escherichia coli (MIC50/90, >32/>32 mug/mL) and Klebsiella spp. (MIC50/90, 0.12/>32 mug/mL) was compromised by the high prevalence of isolates with an ESBL phenotype in the region, particularly in China. Ceftaroline was the most potent beta-lactam tested against S. pneumoniae (MIC50/90 of 0.015/0.25 mug/mL; 99.8% susceptible by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [CLSI] criteria), and it was also highly potent against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC50/90, </= 0.008/0.03 mug/mL; 100% susceptible by CLSI criteria). Ceftaroline was also active against H. parainfluenzae (MIC50/90, </= 0.008/0.015 mug/mL) and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC50/90, 0.06/0.12 mug/mL). In summary, ceftaroline showed potent in vitro activity against a large collection of bacterial isolates (2351) associated with SSTI and CARTI from the Asia-Pacific region and South Africa.
TI  - Two molybdate/tungstate ABC transporters that interact very differently with their substrate binding proteins.
AB  - In all kingdoms of life, ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) transporters participate in many physiological and pathological processes. Despite the diversity of their functions, they have been considered to operate by a largely conserved mechanism. One deviant is the vitamin B12 transporter BtuCD that has been shown to operate by a distinct mechanism. However, it is unknown if this deviation is an exotic example, perhaps arising from the nature of the transported moiety. Here we compared two ABC importers of identical substrate specificity (molybdate/tungstate), and find that their interactions with their substrate binding proteins are utterly different. One system forms a high-affinity, slow-dissociating complex that is destabilized by nucleotide and substrate binding. The other forms a low-affinity, transient complex that is stabilized by ligands. The results highlight significant mechanistic divergence among ABC transporters, even when they share the same substrate specificity. We propose that these differences are correlated with the different folds of the transmembrane domains of ABC transporters.
TI  - [Alpha-Lactalbumin as an ingredient of infant formula].
AB  - Alpha-Lactalbumin is the main whey protein in human milk rising 2,44 g/L in mature milk. It has a key function in the synthesis of lactose from glucose and galactose in the mammary gland although this compound has also other beneficial effects on the infant health due to the high proportion of essential aminoacids (tryptophan and cysteine). It seems also to increase iron absorption in the digestive track, and in in vitro experiments, linked to oleic acid (HAMLET complex), has shown anticarcinogenic effects against cellular tumor such as human papilloma. In addition, this complex has been reported to exhibit antimicrobial properties against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, enteropathogenic strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella thypimurium. However, the in vivo synthesis of HAMLET complex during milk digestion has not been proved yet. Infant formula have been improved considerably during the last decades not only adapting nutrient concentrations to infants requirements but also by the addition of new bioactive ingredients such as alpha-lactalbumin, to have the same functional effect as in breast fed babies.
TI  - Determination of disk diffusion and MIC quality control guidelines for GSK2251052: a novel boron-containing antibacterial.
AB  - GSK2251052 is a boron-containing antimicrobial agent in clinical development for  the treatment of serious Gram-negative bacterial infections. These GSK2251052 quality control (QC) studies were performed to establish ranges for control strains (broth microdilution [BMD] MIC and disk diffusion zones) as follows: Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (2-8 mug/mL and 15-24 mm), Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 (0.5-2 mug/mL and 23-30 mm), Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247 (0.25-1 mug/mL and 22-31 mm), Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 (0.25-1 mug/mL and 19-28 mm), Bacteroides fragilis ATCC 25285 (1-4 mug/mL [BMD] and 1-4 mug/mL [agar dilution]), and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron ATCC 29741 (1-8 mug/mL [BMD] and 2-8 mug/mL [agar dilution]). These ranges, approved by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, will be crucial in accurately evaluating GSK2251052 in vitro potency.
TI  - Bacteremia, causative agents and antimicrobial susceptibility among HIV-1-infected children on antiretroviral therapy in Uganda and Zimbabwe.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteremia is common in HIV-infected children in Africa, including after start of antiretroviral therapy (ART), but there are limited data on causative pathogens and their antimicrobial sensitivity patterns in this population. METHODS: We analyzed data on blood cultures taken from HIV-infected children developing acute febrile illness after enrollment to the Antiretroviral Research for Watoto (ARROW) clinical trial in Uganda and Zimbabwe. Patterns of bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined and bacteremia rates calculated over time from ART initiation. RESULTS: A total of 848 blood cultures were obtained from 461 children, of which 123 (14.5%) from 105 children (median age 3.5 years, 51% girls) were culture positive, including 75 (8.8%) with clearly pathogenic organisms. The event rates for positive cultures with clearly pathogenic organisms after 0-1, 2-3, 4-11 and >/=12 months on ART were 13.3, 11.4, 2.1 and 0.3 per 1000 person-months of follow-up, respectively. The pathogens isolated (n; %) were Streptococcus pneumoniae (36; 28.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (11; 8.7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6; 4.7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6; 4.7%), Salmonella spp (6; 4.7%), Escherichia coli (5; 3.9%), Haemophilus influenzae (1; 0.8%) and fungal spp (4; 3.1%). Other bacteria of doubtful pathogenicity (n = 52; 42%) were also isolated. Most isolates tested were highly (80-100%) susceptible to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin; very few (~5%) were susceptible to cotrimoxazole; S. pneumoniae had high susceptibility to amoxicillin/ampicillin (80%). CONCLUSIONS: Rates of proven bacteremia were >20-fold higher immediately after starting ART compared with 12 months later in African HIV-infected children. S. pneumoniae was most commonly isolated, suggesting need for pneumococcal vaccination and effective prophylactic antibiotics.
TI  - Haemophilus influenzae acquires vitronectin via the ubiquitous Protein F to subvert host innate immunity.
AB  - Acquisition of the complement inhibitor vitronectin (Vn) is important for the respiratory tract pathogen nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) to escape complement-mediated killing. NTHi actively recruits Vn, and we previously showed that this interaction involves Protein E (PE). Here we describe a second Vn-binding protein, a 30 kDa Yersinia YfeA homologue designated as Protein F (PF). An isogenic NTHi 3655Deltahpf mutant devoid of PF displayed a reduced binding of Vn, and was consequently more sensitive to killing by human serum compared with the wild type. Surface expression of PF on Escherichia coli conferred binding of Vn that resulted in a serum resistant phenotype. Molecular analyses revealed that the N-terminal of PF (Lys23-Glu48) bound to the C-terminal of Vn (Phe352-Ser374) without disrupting the inhibitory role of Vn on the membrane attack complex. The PF-Vn complex actively delayed C9 deposition on PF-expressing bacteria. Comparative studies of binding affinity and multiple mutants demonstrated that both PE and PF contribute individually to NTHi serum survival. PF was highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed in a series of randomly selected NTHi clinical isolates (n = 18). In conclusion, the multifaceted binding of Vn is beneficial for NTHi survival in serum and may contribute to successful colonization and consequently infection.
TI  - Identification of bacteria-selective threonyl-tRNA synthetase substrate inhibitors by structure-based design.
AB  - A series of potent and bacteria-selective threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS) inhibitors have been identified using structure-based drug design. These compounds occupied the substrate binding site of ThrRS and showed excellent binding affinities for all of the bacterial orthologues tested. Some of the compounds displayed greatly improved bacterial selectivity. Key residues responsible for potency and bacteria/human ThrRS selectivity have been identified. Antimicrobial activity has been achieved against wild-type Haemophilus influenzae and efflux-deficient mutants of Escherichia coli and Burkholderia thailandensis.
TI  - [Spectrum of pathogens for community-acquired pneumonia in children].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the spectrum of pathogens for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children, and to provide a basis for the diagnosis and treatment of CAP. METHODS: Respiratory secretions and venous blood samples were collected from 1560 children with CAP aged from one month to 9 years within 2 hours after admission, for detection of multiple pathogens. Respiratory virus antigens in nasopharyngeal swab specimens were detected by immunofluorescence. Sputum was used for bacterial culture. Levels of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP)-IgM and Chlamydia pneumoniae (CP)-IgM in venous blood were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: A total of 579 strains of bacteria were isolated from all respiratory secretions, including 213 (36.8%) Gram-positive strains and 366 (63.2%) Gram-negative strains. The five most common strains were Haemophilus influenzae (7.50%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6.73%), Staphylococcus aureus (6.35%), Moraxella catarrhalis (5.19%), and Escherichia coli (3.46%), wherein the beta-lactamase-producing strains accounted for 3.3% of all strains. The non-bacterial pathogens mainly included respiratory syncytial virus (12.88%), MP (7.88%), and CP (8.91%). Mixed infection of pathogens was serious, and the mixed infection of respiratory syncytial virus with Haemophilus influenzae infections were the most common. For most pathogens, the infection rate was higher in children aged under one year than in those aged over one year. CONCLUSIONS: Haemophilus influenzae, respiratory syncytial virus, MP and CP are the main pathogens for children with CAP. For most pathogens, the infection rate is higher in children aged under one year than in those aged over one year. Mixed infection rate of pathogens is high.
TI  - Antimicrobial drug-resistant microbes associated with hospitalized community-acquired and healthcare-associated pneumonia: a multi-center study in Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and healthcare-associated  pneumonia (HCAP) may be caused by potential antimicrobial drug-resistant (PADR) microbes. The aims of this study were to evaluate the incidences and risk factors associated with PADR microbes observed in patients with pneumonia occurring outside the hospital setting in Taiwan. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of patients with CAP or HCAP admitted to six medical centers in the northern, central, and southern regions of Taiwan in 2007. The pathogens were evaluated by microbiological specimens within 72 hours after admission. The patients' comorbidities, pathogens, and outcomes were evaluated. The risk factors of PADR microbes were identified by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The enrolled patients exhibited HCAP (n=713) and CAP (n=933). The pathogens associated with HCAP (n=383) and CAP (n=441) included Pseudomonas spp. (29%vs. 10%, p<0.001), Klebsiella spp. (24% vs. 25%, p=0.250), Escherichia coli (6% vs. 8%, p=0.369), Haemophilus influnezae (3% vs. 7%, p=0.041), Streptococcus pneumoniae (2% vs. 6%, p=0.003) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (8% vs. 4%, p=0.008). The core pathogens of CAP and HCAP differed among the three regions of Taiwan. PADR microbes, including Pseudomonas spp. (n=191), Acinetobacter spp. (n=41), MRSA (n=49) and cefotaxime- or ceftazidime-resistant Enterbacteriaceae (n=25), were isolated from 13% of patients with CAP and 23% of patients with HCAP. Previous hospitalization, and neoplastic and neurological diseases were significant risk factors for acquiring PADR microbes. CONCLUSION: PADR microbes were common in patients with HCAP and CAP in Taiwan. Broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting PADR microbes should be administered to patients who have undergone previous hospitalization and who exhibit neurological disorders and/or malignancies.
TI  - Identification of a Histidine Metal Ligand in the argE-Encoded N-Acetyl-L-Ornithine Deacetylase from Escherichia coli.
AB  - The H355A, H355K, H80A, and H80K mutant enzymes of the argE-encoded N-acetyl-L-ornithine deacetylase (ArgE) from Escherichia coli were prepared, however, only the H355A enzyme was found to be soluble. Kinetic analysis of the Co(II)-loaded H355A exhibited activity levels that were 380-fold less than Co(II)-loaded WT ArgE. Electronic absorption spectra of Co(II)-loaded H355A-ArgE indicate that the bound Co(II) ion resides in a distorted, five-coordinate environment and Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) data for Zn(II) binding to the H355A enzyme provided a dissociation constant (K d) of 39 muM. A three-dimensional homology model of ArgE was generated using the X-ray crystal structure of the dapE-encoded N-succinyl-L,L-diaminopimelic acid desuccinylase (DapE) from Haemophilus influenzae confirming the assignment of H355 as well as H80 as active site ligands.
TI  - Antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) isolates in Namibia: implications for empirical antibiotic treatment of meningitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency associated with high mortality rates. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture is the "gold standard" for diagnosis of meningitis and it is important to establish the susceptibility of the causative microorganism to rationalize treatment. The Namibia Standard Treatment Guidelines (STGs) recommends initiation of empirical antibiotic treatment in patients with signs and symptoms of meningitis after taking a CSF sample for culture and sensitivity. The objective of this study was to assess the antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of microorganisms isolated from CSF to antibiotics commonly used in the empirical treatment of suspected bacterial meningitis in Namibia. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional descriptive study of routinely collected antibiotic susceptibility data from the Namibia Institute of Pathology (NIP) database. Results of CSF culture and sensitivity from January 1, 2009 to May 31, 2012, from 33 state hospitals throughout Namibia were analysed. RESULTS: The most common pathogens isolated were Streptococcus species, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus, and Escherichia coli. The common isolates from CSF showed high resistance (34.3% -73.5%) to penicillin. Over one third (34.3%) of Streptococcus were resistance to penicillin which was higher than 24.8% resistance in the United States. Meningococci were susceptible to several antimicrobial agents including penicillin. The sensitivity to cephalosporins remained high for Streptococcus, Neisseria, E. coli and Haemophilus. The highest percentage of resistance to cephalosporins was seen among ESBL K. pneumoniae (n = 7, 71%-100%), other Klebsiella species (n = 7, 28%-80%), and Staphylococcus (n = 36, 25%-40%). CONCLUSIONS: The common organisms isolated from CSF were Streptococcus Pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus, and E. coli. All common organisms isolated from CSF showed high sensitivity to cephalosporins used in the empirical treatment of meningitis. The resistance of the common isolates to penicillin is high. Most ESBL K. pneumoniae were isolated from CSF samples drawn from neonates and were found to be resistant to the antibiotics recommended in the Namibia STGs. Based on the above findings, it is recommended to use a combination of aminoglycoside and third-generation cephalosporin to treat non-ESBL Klebsiella isolates. Carbapenems (e.g., meropenem) and piperacillin/tazobactam should be considered for treating severely ill patients with suspected ESBL Klebsiella infection. Namibia should have a national antimicrobial resistance surveillance system for early detection of antibiotics that may no longer be effective in treating meningitis and other life-threatening infections due to resistance.
TI  - [Childhood bacterial meningitis trends in Japan from 2009 to 2010].
AB  - We conducted a pediatric survey of bacterial meningitis epidemiology from January 2009 to December 2010 in Japan, and obtained the following results for 314 cases (186 boys, 124 girls, and 4 with gender not reported). Children younger than one year old accounted for the majority of cases (51.2%, 161/314), and the incidence decreased with increasing age. Haemophilus influenzae (in children aged 1 month to 5 years old) was the most common cause of infection (53.2%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 month to 12 years, 24.2%), Streptococcus agalactiae (0-4 months, 7.6%), and Escherichia coli (0-3 months, 3.2%). Susceptibility tests showed that 50.1% (78/153) of the H. influenzae isolates and 63.0% (46/73) of the S. pneumoniae isolates were drug-resistant. Combinations of ampicillin and cephem or carbapenem and other beta-lactams were mainly used as the initial antibiotics for patients under 4 months of age (77.8%, 42/54), and a carbapenem and other beta-lactam combination was used for patients aged 4 months and older (76.4%, 198/259). The final antibiotics for H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae were mainly cefotaxime (CTX) or ceftriaxone (CTRX) and carbapenem, respectively. The overall fatality rate was 2.0% (6/305). Since the Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (Hib vaccine) and the 7 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) are not widely used in Japan, only 5 patients in our cohort (all with meningitis not caused by H. influenzae) had been immunized with the Hib vaccine, and none had been immunized with the PCV7 vaccine. No remarkable changes in the characteristics of pediatric meningitis have been observed for several years in Japan.
TI  - A reflection on bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents at a major tertiary  care center in Lebanon over a decade.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance has been inflecting deleterious health and economic consequences locally and globally. This study addresses the patterns and trends of bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents over a decade, at a major tertiary care center in Beirut. METHODS: Data on bacterial susceptibility patterns at the CAP accredited Clinical Microbiology Laboratory is analyzed from January 2000 to November 2011, along with related different studies conducted during this period. RESULTS: Increasing rates of ESBL-producing isolates were noted for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. Resistance to carbapenems remains problematic in Acinetobacter spp, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and started emerging in E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Tigecycline and colistin maintained excellent activity against most ESBL and carbapenem resistant bacteria relevant to the treatment by these agents. Resistance to quinolones is being encountered in Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), though remaining relatively high, showed decreasing trends of resistance, while vancomycin maintain uniform activity. Rare and sporadic vancomycin resistant strains in enterococci are encountered. Macrolide and clindamycin increasing rates of resistance is noted in S. pneumoniae, group A streptococci, S. aureus, viridans streptococci and some others. CONCLUSION: Physicians should be aware of the local epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance to properly guide the initial therapy. These resistance problems can be attributed to uncontrolled use of antimicrobial agents, thus, highlighting the need for antimicrobial stewardship to curb this threat.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,866 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2010].
AB  - Postmarketing surveillance of levofloxacin (LVFX) has been conducted continuously since 1992. The present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in Japan to 30 selected antibacterial agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (FQs). The common respiratory pathogens Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to FQs. In contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among S pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Regarding H. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). Enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to FQs, however, prevalence of LVFX-resistant Escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. Nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of LVFX-resistant E. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence of LVFX 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. Another Enterobacteriaceae member, Klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to FQs, in contrast with E. coli. In methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the percentage of FQ-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other FQs. However, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates were highly susceptible to FQs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. The prevalence of FQs-resistant isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of FQ-resistance in MRSA. The prevalence of FQs-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (UTIs) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in P. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (RTIs). While this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were noted in the prevalence of FQ-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates derived from UTIs. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from UTIs and 0.3% among isolates from RTIs, a decrease from the results of 2007. Acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to FQs. Imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). Neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance of 81.3-82.5%, to FQs. Ceftriaxone (CTRX) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to CTRX in some clinical isolates. The result of the present survey indicated that although methicillin-resistant staphylococci, Enterococcus faecium, P. aeruginosa from UTIs, N. gonorrhoeae, and E. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the FQs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. While FQ resistance has been prevailing in E. coli, E. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to FQs. The other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against FQs.
TI  - Remarkable diversity in the enzymes catalyzing the last step in synthesis of the  pimelate moiety of biotin.
AB  - Biotin synthesis in Escherichia coli requires the functions of the bioH and bioC  genes to synthesize the precursor pimelate moiety by use of a modified fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. However, it was previously noted that bioH has been replaced with bioG or bioK within the biotin synthetic gene clusters of other bacteria. We report that each of four BioG proteins from diverse bacteria and two cyanobacterial BioK proteins functionally replace E. coli BioH in vivo. Moreover, purified BioG proteins have esterase activity against pimeloyl-ACP methyl ester, the physiological substrate of BioH. Two of the BioG proteins block biotin synthesis when highly expressed and these toxic proteins were shown to have more promiscuous substrate specificities than the non-toxic BioG proteins. A postulated BioG-BioC fusion protein was shown to functionally replace both the BioH and BioC functions of E. coli. Although the BioH, BioG and BioK esterases catalyze a common reaction, the proteins are evolutionarily distinct.
TI  - Bloodstream infection among children presenting to a general hospital outpatient  clinic in urban Nepal.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are limited data on the etiology and characteristics of bloodstream infections in children presenting in hospital outpatient settings in South Asia. Previous studies in Nepal have highlighted the importance of murine typhus as a cause of febrile illness in adults and enteric fever as a leading bacterial cause of fever among children admitted to hospital. METHODS: We prospectively studied a total of 1084 febrile children aged between 2 months and 14 years presenting to a general hospital outpatient department in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, over two study periods (summer and winter). Blood from all patients was tested by conventional culture and by real-time PCR for Rickettsia typhi. RESULTS: Putative etiological agents for fever were identified in 164 (15%) patients. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) was identified in 107 (10%), S. enterica serovar Paratyphi A (S. Paratyphi) in 30 (3%), Streptococcus pneumoniae in 6 (0.6%), S. enterica serovar Typhimurium in 2 (0.2%), Haemophilus influenzae type b in 1 (0.1%), and Escherichia coli in 1 (0.1%) patient. S. Typhi was the most common organism isolated from blood during both summer and winter. Twenty-two (2%) patients were PCR positive for R. typhi. No significant demographic, clinical and laboratory features distinguished culture positive enteric fever and murine typhus. CONCLUSIONS: Salmonella infections are the leading cause of bloodstream infection among pediatric outpatients with fever in Kathmandu Valley. Extension of immunization programs against invasive bacterial disease to include the agents of enteric fever and pneumococcus could improve the health of children in Nepal.
TI  - Bronchial colonisation in patients with lung cancer: a prospective study.
AB  - Bronchial colonisation is frequently reported in patients with lung cancer, and has a potential impact on therapeutic management and prognosis. We aimed to prospectively define the prevalence and nature of bronchial colonisation in patients at the time of diagnosing lung cancer. 210 consecutive patients with lung cancer underwent a flexible bronchoscopy for lung cancer. The type and frequency of bacterial, mycobacterial and fungal colonisation were analysed and correlated with the patients' and tumours' characteristics. Potential pathogens were found in 48.1% of samples: mainly the Gram-negative bacilli Escherichia coli (8.1%), Haemophilus influenzae (4.3%) and Enterobacter spp. (2.4%); Gram-positive cocci, Staphylococcus spp. (12.9%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (3.3%); atypical mycobacteria (2.9%); Candida albicans (42.9%); and Aspergillus fumigatus (6.2%). Aged patients (p=0.02) with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p=0.008) were significantly more frequently colonised; however, tumour stage, atelectasis, bronchial stenosis and abnormalities of chest radiography were not associated with a higher rate of colonisation. Squamous cell carcinoma tended to be more frequently colonised than other histological subtypes. Airway colonisation was reported in almost half of patients presenting with lung cancer, mainly in fragile patients, and was significantly associated with worse survival (p=0.005). Analysing colonisation status of patients at the time of diagnosis may help improve the management of lung cancer.
TI  - The OmpA family of proteins: roles in bacterial pathogenesis and immunity.
AB  - The OmpA family of outer membrane proteins is a group of genetically related, heat-modifiable, surface-exposed, porin proteins that are in high-copy number in the outer membrane of mainly Gram-negative bacteria. OmpA proteins are characterized by an N-terminal domain that forms an eight-stranded, anti-parallel beta barrel, which is embedded in the outer membrane. The C-terminal domain is globular and located in the periplasmic space. Escherichia coli OmpA is the best characterized of the proteins. Other well-characterized OmpA-equivalent proteins from pathogenic bacteria include Pseudomonas aeruginosa OprF, Haemophilus influenzae P5, Klebsiella pneumoniae OmpA, and Chlamydia trachomatis major outer membrane protein (MOMP). OmpA from the veterinary pathogens Mannheimia haemolytica, Haemophilus parasuis, Leptospira interrogans, and Pasteurella multocida have been studied to a lesser extent. Among many of the pathogenic bacteria, OmpA proteins have important pathogenic roles including bacterial adhesion, invasion, or intracellular survival as well as evasion of host defenses or stimulators of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. These pathogenic roles are most commonly associated with central nervous system, respiratory and urogenital diseases. Alternatively, OmpA family proteins can serve as targets of the immune system with immunogenicity related to surface-exposed loops of the molecule. In several cases, OmpA proteins are under evaluation as potential vaccine candidates.
TI  - Characterization of a ferrous iron-responsive two-component system in nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI), an opportunistic pathogen that is commonly found in the human upper respiratory tract, has only four identified two-component signal transduction systems. One of these, an ortholog to the QseBC (quorum-sensing Escherichia coli) system, was characterized. This system, designated firRS, was found to be transcribed in an operon with a gene encoding a small, predicted periplasmic protein with an unknown function, ygiW. The ygiW-firRS operon exhibited a unique feature with an attenuator present between ygiW and firR that caused the ygiW transcript level to be 6-fold higher than the ygiW-firRS transcript level. FirRS induced expression of ygiW and firR, demonstrating that FirR is an autoactivator. Unlike the QseBC system of E. coli, FirRS does not respond to epinephrine or norepinephrine. FirRS signal transduction was stimulated when NTHI cultures were exposed to ferrous iron or zinc but was unresponsive to ferric iron. Notably, the ferrous iron-responsive activation only occurred when a putative iron-binding site in FirS and the key phosphorylation aspartate in FirR were intact. FirRS was also activated when cultures were exposed to cold shock. Mutants in ygiW, firR, and firS were attenuated during pulmonary infection, but not otitis media. These data demonstrate that the H. influenzae strain 2019 FirRS is a two-component regulatory system that senses ferrous iron and autoregulates its own operon.
TI  - QseC controls biofilm formation of non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae in addition to an AI-2-dependent mechanism.
AB  - Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a common pathogen associated with diseases such as acute otitis media or exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The biofilm-forming capability substantially contributes to the persistence of NTHi. However, the regulation of biofilm formation is not completely understood. Quorum sensing regulated by autoinducer-2 produced by luxS is until now the only described regulatory mechanism. In this study, we show that the two-component signalling system QseB/C is involved in the biofilm formation of NTHi in vitro. An isogenic NTHi mutant of qseC (Hi3655KR2) showed a significant decrease in biofilm formation under static and semi-static conditions as assessed by crystal violet staining. In addition, under constant flow conditions, Hi3655KR2 formed less biofilm after 48 h. The biofilm defects were irrespective of autoinducer-2 levels. Hence, here we suggest for the first time a regulatory circuit in NTHi, which controls biofilm formation by mechanisms other than or in addition to luxS-dependent factors.
TI  - Development of a single-tube loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for detection of four pathogens of bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Several loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays have been developed  to detect common causative pathogens of bacterial meningitis (BM). However, no LAMP assay is reported to detect Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus suis, which are also among common pathogens of BM. Moreover, it is laborious and expensive by performing multiple reactions for each sample to detect bacterial pathogen. Thus, we aimed to design and develop a single-tube LAMP assay capable of detecting multiple bacterial species, based on the nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA genes of the bacteria. The nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA genes of main pathogens involved in BM were aligned to identify conserved regions, which were further used to design broad range specific LAMP assay primers. We successfully designed a set of broad range specific LAMP assay primers for simultaneous detection of four species including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. suis and S. agalactiae. The broad range LAMP assay was highly specific without cross-reactivity with other bacteria including Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and Escherichia coli. The sensitivity of our LAMP assay was 100-1000 times higher compared with the conventional PCR assay. The bacterial species could be identified after digestion of the LAMP products with restriction endonuclease DdeI and HaeIII.
TI  - Oligomeric state study of prokaryotic rhomboid proteases.
AB  - Rhomboid peptidases (proteases) play key roles in signaling events at the membrane bilayer. Understanding the regulation of rhomboid function is crucial for insight into its mechanism of action. Here we examine the oligomeric state of three different rhomboid proteases. We subjected Haemophilus influenzae, (hiGlpG), Escherichia coli GlpG (ecGlpG) and Bacillus subtilis (YqgP) to sedimentation equilibrium analysis in detergent-solubilized dodecylmaltoside (DDM) solution. For hiGlpG and ecGlpG, rhomboids consisting of the core 6 transmembrane domains without and with soluble domains respectively, and YqgP, predicted to have 7 transmembrane domains with larger soluble domains at the termini, the predominant species was dimeric with low amounts of monomer and tetramers observed. To examine the effect of the membrane domain alone on oligomeric state of rhomboid, hiGlpG, the simplest form from the rhomboid class of intramembrane proteases representing the canonical rhomboid core of six transmembrane domains, was studied further. Using gel filtration and crosslinking we demonstrate that hiGlpG is dimeric and functional in DDM detergent solution. More importantly co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that the dimer is present in the lipid bilayer suggesting a physiological dimer. Overall these results indicate that rhomboids form oligomers which are facilitated by the membrane domain. For hiGlpG we have shown that these oligomers exist in the lipid bilayer. This is the first detailed oligomeric state characterization of the rhomboid family of peptidases.
TI  - Haemophilus influenzae and oxidative stress.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae is a commensal of the human upper respiratory tract. H. influenzae can, however, move out of its commensal niche and cause multiple respiratory tract diseases. Such diseases include otitis media in young children, as well as exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), sinusitis, conjunctivitis, and bronchitis. During the course of colonization and infection, H. influenzae must withstand oxidative stress generated by multiple reactive oxygen species produced endogenously, by other co-pathogens and by host cells. H. influenzae has, therefore, evolved multiple mechanisms that protect the cell against oxygen-generated stresses. In this review, we will describe these systems relative to the well-described systems in Escherichia coli. Moreover, we will compare how H. influenzae combats the effect of oxidative stress as a necessary phenotype for its roles as both a successful commensal and pathogen.
TI  - A modified pathway for the production of acetone in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A modified synthetic acetone operon was constructed. It consists of two genes from Clostridium acetobutylicum (thlA coding for thiolase and adc coding for acetoacetate decarboxylase) and one from Bacillus subtilis or Haemophilus influenzae (teII(srf) or ybgC, respectively, for thioesterase). Expression of this operon in Escherichia coli resulted in the production of acetone starting from the common metabolite acetyl-CoA via acetoacetyl-CoA and acetoacetate. The thioesterases do not need a CoA acceptor for acetoacetyl-CoA hydrolysis. Thus, in contrast to the classic acetone pathway of Clostridium acetobutylicum and related microorganisms which employ a CoA transferase, the new pathway is acetate independent. The genetic background of the host strains was crucial. Only E. coli strains HB101 and WL3 were able to produce acetone via the modified plasmid based pathway, up to 64mM and 42mM in 5-ml cultures, respectively. Using glucose fed-batch cultures the concentration could be increased up to 122mM acetone with HB101 carrying the recombinant plasmid pUC19ayt (thioesterase from H. influenzae). The formation of acetone led to a decreased acetate production by E. coli.
TI  - Novel rapidly diversifiable antimicrobial RNA polymerase switch region inhibitors with confirmed mode of action in Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - A series of inhibitors with a squaramide core was synthesized following its discovery in a high-throughput screen for novel inhibitors of a transcription-coupled translation assay using Escherichia coli S30 extracts. The inhibitors were inactive when the plasmid substrate was replaced with mRNA, suggesting they interfered with transcription. This was confirmed by their inhibition of purified E. coli RNA polymerase. The series had antimicrobial activity against efflux-negative strains of E. coli and Haemophilus influenzae. Like rifampin, the squaramides preferentially inhibited synthesis of RNA and protein over fatty acids, peptidoglycan, and DNA. However, squaramide-resistant mutants were not cross-resistant to rifampin. Nine different mutations were found in parts of rpoB or rpoC that together encode the so-called switch region of RNA polymerase. This is the binding site of the natural antibiotics myxopyronin, corallopyronin, and ripostatin and the drug fidaxomicin. Computational modeling using the X-ray crystal structure of the myxopyronin-bound RNA polymerase of Thermus thermophilus suggests a binding mode of these inhibitors that is consistent with the resistance mutations. The squaramides are the first reported non-natural-product-related, rapidly diversifiable antibacterial inhibitors acting via the switch region of RNA polymerase.
TI  - Comparison of clinical and microbiological features of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal and pubertal girls.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Vulvovaginitisis the most common gynecological problem of childhood. The aim of the study was to determine and compare clinical and microbiological features of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal and adolescent girls. METHODS: In this retrospective study, the records of patients who were diagnosed with vulvovaginitis between January 2005 and December 2010 in the pediatric outpatient clinic at Fatih University Hospital were retrieved. Information regarding age, symptoms, history of antibiotic use within 1 month prior to presentation, findings on urinalysis, serum antistreptolysin-O levels, and results of urine/vaginal cultures was collected. RESULTS: The records of 112 patients were evaluated, 72 of which were prepubertal (64.2%) and 40 were pubertal (35.7%) at the time of diagnosis. Thirty-eight prepubertal patients (52.7%) had a positive result on vaginal culture, the most commonly encountered microorganism being group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (15.2%). Culture positivity rate in the pubertal group was 47.5% (19 patients), with Candida albicans being the most frequently isolated microorganism (27.5%). CONCLUSION: The etiopathogenesis and culture results differ between prepubertal and adolescent girls with vulvovaginitis, which should be taken into consideration in the treatment approach of this disorder.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibilityof clinical isolates of aerobic gram-negative bacteria in 2008].
AB  - We determined MICs of antibacterial agents against 1145 clinical strains of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (22 species) isolated at 16 Japanese facilities in 2008. MICs were determined using mostly broth microdilution method and antibacterial activity was assessed. Strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) accounted for 3.8% of Escherichia coli, 2.6% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 6.8% of Klebsiella oxytoca, 5.5% of Proteus mirabilis and 1.8% of Proteus vulgaris. ESBL produced strains were 6.8% at K. oxytoca that increased compared with 3.2% and 5.5% at P. mirabilis that decreased compared with 18.8% in 2006. Among Haemophilus influenzae, 61.7% that decreased compared with 67.7% in 2006, equaled 58.7% in 2004, were strains when classified by penicillin-binding protein 3 mutation. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the activity of most antibacterial agents was similar to that in 2006. Although two antibacterial agents that tobramycin showed an MIC90 of 1 microg/mL and doripenem showed an MIC90 of 4 microg/mL against P. aeruginosa have potent activity. Of all P. aeruginosa strains, 4.3% were resistant to six agents of nine antipseudomonal agents, that decreased compared to 12.2% in 2004 and 5.7% in 2006. Against other glucose-non-fermentative Gram-negative rods, the activity of most antibacterial agents was similar to that in 2006.
TI  - Proteobacterial ArfA peptides are synthesized from non-stop messenger RNAs.
AB  - The translation of non-stop mRNA (which lack in-frame stop codons) represents a significant quality control problem for all organisms. In eubacteria, the transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA) system facilitates recycling of stalled ribosomes from non-stop mRNA in a process termed trans-translation or ribosome rescue. During rescue, the nascent chain is tagged with the tmRNA-encoded ssrA peptide, which promotes polypeptide degradation after release from the stalled ribosome. Escherichia coli possesses an additional ribosome rescue pathway mediated by the ArfA peptide. The E. coli arfA message contains a hairpin structure that is cleaved by RNase III to produce a non-stop transcript. Therefore, ArfA levels are controlled by tmRNA through ssrA-peptide tagging and proteolysis. Here, we examine whether ArfA homologues from other bacteria are also regulated by RNase III and tmRNA. We searched 431 arfA coding sequences for mRNA secondary structures and found that 82.8% of the transcripts contain predicted hairpins in their 3'-coding regions. The arfA hairpins from Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis, Vibrio fischeri, and Pasteurella multocida are all cleaved by RNase III as predicted, whereas the hairpin from Neisseria gonorrhoeae functions as an intrinsic transcription terminator to generate non-stop mRNA. Each ArfA homologue is ssrA-tagged and degraded when expressed in wild-type E. coli cells, but accumulates in mutants lacking tmRNA. Together, these findings show that ArfA synthesis from non-stop mRNA is a conserved mechanism to regulate the alternative ribosome rescue pathway. This strategy ensures that ArfA homologues are only deployed when the tmRNA system is incapacitated or overwhelmed by stalled ribosomes.
TI  - Epidemiology, aetiology and management of childhood acute community-acquired pneumonia in developing countries--a review.
AB  - Childhood acute community-acquired pneumonia is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. In children who have not received prior antibiotic therapy, the main bacterial causes of clinical pneumonia in developing countries are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), and the main viral cause is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), but estimates of their relative importance vary in different settings. The only vaccines for the prevention of bacterial pneumonia (excluding vaccines for pertussis and measles) are Hib and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV). In children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, bacterial infection remains a major cause of pneumonia mortality; however, Pneumocystis jirovecii and Mycobacterium tuberculosis are important causes of pneumonia in them. Studies of bacterial aetiology of acute pneumonia in severely malnourished children have implicated Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and H. influenzae, with very few data on the role of respiratory viruses and tuberculosis. Studies of neonatal sepsis suggest that Gram-negative enteric organisms, particularly Klebsiella spp., and Gram-positive organisms, mainly pneumococcus, group b Streptococcus and S. aureus are causes of neonatal pneumonia. Many of the developing countries that ranked high in pneumonia mortality are preparing to introduce new pneumonia vaccines with support from Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunization (GAVI Alliance), plan for the expansion of community-based case management and have ambitious plans for strengthening health systems. Assurance that these plans are implemented will require funding and continued public attention to pneumonia, which will help contribute to a substantial decline in childhood pneumonia deaths.
TI  - Community-acquired bacterial bloodstream infections in developing countries in south and southeast Asia: a systematic review.
AB  - Information about community-acquired bacteraemia in developing countries in south and southeast Asia is scarce. We aimed to establish the case fraction of bacteraemia in febrile patients admitted to hospital. We searched four databases and identified studies of south and southeast Asia published between 1990 and 2010 that prospectively assessed patients admitted to hospital and from whom a blood culture was taken. We reviewed 17 eligible studies describing 40,644 patients. Pathogenic organisms were isolated from 3506 patients (9%; range 1-51%); 1784 (12%) of 14,386 adults and 1722 (7%) of 26,258 children. Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi was the most common bacterial pathogen, accounting for 532 of 1798 (30%) isolates in adults and 432 of 1723 (25%) in children. Other commonly isolated organisms in adults were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and other gram-negative organisms, and in children were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. A substantial case fraction of bacteraemia occurs in patients admitted to hospital with fever in this region. Management could be improved if diagnostic microbiology facilities were more widely available. The prevailing organisms causing bacteraemia and their susceptibility patterns could inform empirical treatment regimens and prevention strategies.
TI  - Future challenges in the elimination of bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Despite the widespread implementation of several effective vaccines over the past few decades, bacterial meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and Group B Streptococcus (GBS) still results in unacceptably high levels of human mortality and morbidity. A residual disease burden due to bacterial meningitis is also apparent due to a number of persistent or emerging pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp. and Streptococcus suis. Here, we review the current status of bacterial meningitis caused by these pathogens, highlighting how past and present vaccination programs have attempted to counter these pathogens. We discuss how improved pathogen surveillance, implementation of current vaccines, and development of novel vaccines may be expected to further reduce bacterial meningitis and related diseases in the future.
TI  - Natural transformation of Gallibacterium anatis.
AB  - Gallibacterium anatis is a pathogen of poultry. Very little is known about its genetics and pathogenesis. To enable the study of gene function in G. anatis, we have established methods for transformation and targeted mutagenesis. The genus Gallibacterium belongs to the Pasteurellaceae, a group with several naturally transformable members, including Haemophilus influenzae. Bioinformatics analysis identified G. anatis homologs of the H. influenzae competence genes, and natural competence was induced in G. anatis by the procedure established for H. influenzae: transfer from rich medium to the starvation medium M-IV. This procedure gave reproducibly high transformation frequencies with G. anatis chromosomal DNA and with linearized plasmid DNA carrying G. anatis sequences. Both DNA types integrated into the G. anatis chromosome by homologous recombination. Targeted mutagenesis gave transformation frequencies of >2 x 10(-4) transformants CFU(-1). Transformation was also efficient with circular plasmid containing no G. anatis DNA; this resulted in the establishment of a self-replicating plasmid. Nine diverse G. anatis strains were found to be naturally transformable by this procedure, suggesting that natural competence is common and the M-IV transformation procedure widely applicable for this species. The G. anatis genome is only slightly enriched for the uptake signal sequences identified in other pasteurellaceaen genomes, but G. anatis did preferentially take up its own DNA over that of Escherichia coli. Transformation by electroporation was not effective for chromosomal integration but could be used to introduce self-replicating plasmids. The findings described here provide important tools for the genetic manipulation of G. anatis.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of sitafloxacin against bacteria isolated from Thai patients with urinary tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine comparative in vitro activity of sitafloxacin against clinical isolates of bacteria from Thai patients with urinary tract infection and those with lower respiratory tract infection. MATERIAL AND METHOD: 1,255 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus spp, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis isolated from different Thai patients with urinary tract infection and those with lower respiratory tract infection in 2010 were included. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of sitafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, imipenem, amikacin, ampicillin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, penicillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, azithromycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were determined by standard agar dilution method. RESULTS: The MIC50 and MIC90 values of sitafloxacin against all tested bacteria were lowest when compared with those of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin. Sitafloxacin was active against 51% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates. The activity of sitafloxacin against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria, such as, extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli and K. pneumomiae, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii was comparable to or more than that of some beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors, cephalosporins or carbapenems. CONCLUSION: Sitafloxacin is more active than levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against isolated bacteria from Thai patients with urinary tract and lower respiratory infections including antibiotic resistant bacteria, such as MRSA, ESBL-producing Gram-negatives, carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii.
TI  - Natural DNA uptake by Escherichia coli.
AB  - Escherichia coli has homologues of the competence genes other species use for DNA uptake and processing, but natural competence and transformation have never been detected. Although we previously showed that these genes are induced by the competence regulator Sxy as in other gamma-proteobacteria, no conditions are known that naturally induce sxy expression. We have now tested whether the competence gene homologues encode a functional DNA uptake machinery and whether DNA uptake leads to recombination, by investigating the effects of plasmid-borne sxy expression on natural competence in a wide variety of E. coli strains. High- and low-level sxy expression alone did not induce transformation in any of the strains tested, despite varying the transforming DNA, its concentration, and the incubation conditions used. Direct measurements of uptake of radiolabelled DNA were below the limit of detection, however transformants were readily detected when recombination functions were provided by the lambda Red recombinase. This is the first demonstration that E. coli sxy expression can induce natural DNA uptake and that E. coli's competence genes do encode a functional uptake machinery. However, the amount of transformation cells undergo is limited both by low levels of DNA uptake and by inefficient DNA processing/recombination.
TI  - Bacteriology of the paranasal sinuses in pediatric cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To review the characteristic microbiology of the paranasal sinuses in patients with cystic fibrosis who undergo endoscopic sinus surgery. To examine the subtypes of organisms cultured from the maxillary sinuses and determine their sensitivity to antibiotic therapy. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: Tertiary care children's hospital. METHODS: Sinus cultures were obtained from 51 patients with cystic fibrosis during endoscopic sinus procedures between 2000 and 2004 at a tertiary care children's hospital. A retrospective chart review was undertaken to obtain culture and sensitivity data of the sinus contents. RESULTS: The most common bacteria isolated was Staphylococcus aureus (71%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PSA) (27%), Haemophilus influenzae (21%), Staphylococcus non-aureus (16%) and Streptococcus viridans (12%). Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis were rarely isolated (2% and 0% respectively). Twenty-nine percent of the patients with cultures positive for PSA were of the mucoid variant. Only one patient had culture positive Escherichia coli. Antibiotic resistance among the more common organisms cultured from the sinus samples is also listed. CONCLUSION: Staph. aureus is the most common isolate in the sinuses of this pediatric CF population followed by P. aeruginosa and H. influenzae. Although many isolates are pansensitive, some isolates are panresistant.
TI  - Membrane binding of Escherichia coli RNase E catalytic domain stabilizes protein  structure and increases RNA substrate affinity.
AB  - RNase E plays an essential role in RNA processing and decay and tethers to the cytoplasmic membrane in Escherichia coli; however, the function of this membrane-protein interaction has remained unclear. Here, we establish a mechanistic role for the RNase E-membrane interaction. The reconstituted highly conserved N-terminal fragment of RNase E (NRne, residues 1-499) binds specifically to anionic phospholipids through electrostatic interactions. The membrane-binding specificity of NRne was confirmed using circular dichroism difference spectroscopy; the dissociation constant (K(d)) for NRne binding to anionic liposomes was 298 nM. E. coli RNase G and RNase E/G homologs from phylogenetically distant Aquifex aeolicus, Haemophilus influenzae Rd, and Synechocystis sp. were found to be membrane-binding proteins. Electrostatic potentials of NRne and its homologs were found to be conserved, highly positive, and spread over a large surface area encompassing four putative membrane-binding regions identified in the "large" domain (amino acids 1-400, consisting of the RNase H, S1, 5'-sensor, and DNase I subdomains) of E. coli NRne. In vitro cleavage assay using liposome-free and liposome-bound NRne and RNA substrates BR13 and GGG-RNAI showed that NRne membrane binding altered its enzymatic activity. Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed no obvious thermotropic structural changes in membrane-bound NRne between 10 and 60 degrees C, and membrane-bound NRne retained its normal cleavage activity after cooling. Thus, NRne membrane binding induced changes in secondary protein structure and enzymatic activation by stabilizing the protein-folding state and increasing its binding affinity for its substrate. Our results demonstrate that RNase E-membrane interaction enhances the rate of RNA processing and decay.
TI  - Bacterial infections in Lilongwe, Malawi: aetiology and antibiotic resistance.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Life-threatening infections present major challenges for health systems in Malawi and the developing world because routine microbiologic culture and sensitivity testing are not performed due to lack of capacity. Use of empirical antimicrobial therapy without regular microbiologic surveillance is unable to provide adequate treatment in the face of emerging antimicrobial resistance. This study was conducted to determine antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in order to inform treatment choices and generate hospital-wide baseline data. METHODS: Culture and susceptibility testing was performed on various specimens from patients presenting with possible infectious diseases at Kamuzu Central Hospital, Lilongwe, Malawi. RESULTS: Between July 2006 and December 2007 3104 specimens from 2458 patients were evaluated, with 60.1% from the adult medical service. Common presentations were sepsis, meningitis, pneumonia and abscess. An etiologic agent was detected in 13% of patients. The most common organisms detected from blood cultures were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella species and Streptococcus pneumoniae, whereas Streptococcus pneumoniae and Cryptococcus neoformans were most frequently detected from cerebrospinal fluid. Haemophilus influenzae was rarely isolated. Resistance to commonly used antibiotics was observed in up to 80% of the isolates while antibiotics that were not commonly in use maintained susceptibility. CONCLUSIONS: There is widespread resistance to almost all of the antibiotics that are empirically used in Malawi. Antibiotics that have not been widely introduced in Malawi show better laboratory performance. Choices for empirical therapy in Malawi should be revised accordingly. A microbiologic surveillance system should be established and prudent use of antimicrobials promoted to improve patient care.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of clarithromycin loaded PLGA nanoparticles.
AB  - Novel drug delivery systems such as nanoparticles (NPs) have been proved to enhance the effectiveness of many drugs. Clarithromycin is a broad spectrum macrolide antibiotic, used in many infectious conditions like upper and lower respiratory tract infections, and skin and other soft tissue infections. This paper describes the preparation and enhanced in vitro antibacterial activities of clarithromycin loaded poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles. A modified quasi-emulsion solvent diffusion (MQESD) method was used to prepare clarithromycin (CLR) NPs. The antibacterial activity of the NPs was evaluated using the agar well diffusion method against Escherichia coli (PTCC 1330), Haemophilus influenzae (PTCC 1623), Salmonella typhi (PTCC 1609), Staphylococcus aureus (PTCC 1112) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (PTCC 1240). The inhibition zone diameters related to each nano formulation were compared with those for untreated CLR at the same concentrations. The results indicated that the mean inhibition zone diameters of NPs against all the bacteria tested were significantly higher than those of untreated CLR, particularly in the case of S. aureus. The increased potency of CLR NPs may be related to some physicochemical properties of NPs like modified surface characteristics, lower drug degradation, and increased drug adsorption and uptake.
TI  - Structure-function relations in the NTPase domain of the antiviral tRNA ribotoxin Escherichia coli PrrC.
AB  - Breakage of tRNA by Escherichia coli anticodon nuclease PrrC (EcoPrrC) underlies  a host antiviral response to phage T4 infection. Expression of EcoPrrC is cytocidal in yeast, signifying that PrrC ribotoxicity crosses phylogenetic domain boundaries. EcoPrrC consists of an N-terminal NTPase module that resembles ABC transporters and a C-terminal nuclease module that is sui generis. PrrC homologs are prevalent in many other bacteria. Here we report that Haemophilus influenzae PrrC is toxic in E. coli and yeast. To illuminate structure-activity relations, we conducted a new round of mutational analysis of EcoPrrC guided by primary structure conservation among toxic PrrC homologs. We indentify 17 candidate active site residues in the NTPase module that are essential for toxicity in yeast when EcoPrrC is expressed at high gene dosage. Their functions could be educed by integrating mutational data with the atomic structure of the transition-state complex of a homologous ABC protein.
TI  - Microbiological aspects of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls.
AB  - This study aimed to establish the vaginal introitus microbial flora in girls with and without symptoms of vulvovaginitis, and to present the distribution of isolated microorganisms by age groups in girls with vulvovaginitis. We enrolled 500 girls with vulvovaginitis symptoms, aged 2-12 years, referred by their pediatricians for microbiological examination of the vaginal introitus swabs, and 30 age-matched asymptomatic girls. Similar microbial flora was isolated in both groups, but the symptomatic girls had significantly more common positive microbiological findings compared to controls (p < 0.001). In symptomatic girls, the following pathogenic bacteria were isolated: Streptococcus pyogenes (4.2%), Haemophilus influenzae (0.4%), and Staphylococcus aureus (5.8%). Bacteria of fecal origin were found in vaginal introitus swabs in 33.8% of cases, most commonly Proteus mirabilis (14.4%), Enterococcus faecalis (12.2%), and Escherichia coli (7.0%). The finding of fecal flora was more common compared to controls, reaching a statistical significance (p < 0.05), as well as in girls aged up to 6 years (p < 0.001). Candida species were found in 2.4% of girls with vulvovaginitis symptoms. CONCLUSION: The microbial ecosystem in girls with clinical signs of vulvovaginitis is complex and variable, and the presence of a microorganism does not necessarily imply that it is the cause of infection. The diagnosis of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls requires a complex and comprehensive approach, and microbiological findings should be interpreted in the context of clinical findings.
TI  - Development of 4H-pyridopyrimidines: a class of selective bacterial protein synthesis inhibitors.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We have identified a series of compounds that inhibit protein synthesis in bacteria. Initial IC50's in aminoacylation/translation (A/T) assays ranged from 3 to14 muM. This series of compounds are variations on a 5,6,7,8-tetrahydropyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidin-4-ol scaffold (e.g., 4H-pyridopyrimidine). METHODS: Greater than 80 analogs were prepared to investigate the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Structural modifications included changes in the central ring and substituent modifications in its periphery focusing on the 2- and 6-positions. An A/T system was used to determine IC50 values for activity of the analogs in biochemical assays. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined for each analog against cultures of Enterococcus faecalis, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli tolC mutants and E. coli modified with PMBN. RESULTS: Modifications to the 2-(pyridin-2-yl) ring resulted in complete inactivation of the compounds. However, certain modifications at the 6-position resulted in increased antimicrobial potency. The optimized compounds inhibited the growth of E. faecalis, M. catarrhalis, H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, E. coli tolC, mutants and E. coli modified with PMBN with MIC values of 4, </= 0.12, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1 mug/ml, respectively. IC50 values in biochemical assay were reduced to mid-nanomolar range. CONCLUSION: 4H-pyridopyrimidine analogs demonstrate broad-spectrum inhibition of bacterial growth and modification of the compounds establishes SAR.
TI  - Comparative MIC evaluation of a generic ceftriaxone by broth microdilution on clinically relevant isolates from an academic hospital complex in South Africa.
AB  - We evaluated the in vitro microbiological efficacy of a generic ceftriaxone product against several clinically significant organisms collected from sterile sites. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each was determined simultaneously with the reference and the generic ceftriaxone product. Comparative analysis of MICs between the two products for each isolate was performed using both categorical (interpretive) agreement and essential (actual MIC value) agreement. A total of 260 isolates were tested. Overall, there was categorical agreement of 98.9% and essential agreement of 95.8%. The categorical agreement for all isolates (96.7 - 100%) accorded with international standards, as no very major errors were seen and the major error rate was less than 3%. Of the 90 isolates of E. coli (40), Klebsiella spp. (40) and Salmonella spp. (10), 87.6% had an MIC less than or equal to 0.12mg/l. The generic ceftriaxone product showed equivalent efficacy by MIC determination to the reference formulation. Ceftriaxone remains a viable and useful antimicrobial agent against a variety of clinically relevant organisms in our setting.
TI  - Interactions of ocular isolates of gram-negative bacteria with lactoferrin.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim was to examine the interaction of lactoferrin with gram-negative bacteria isolated from ocular adverse responses. METHODS: Strains representing the species Pseudomonas aeruginosa (six strains), Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Haemophilus influenza were tested. A modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the binding of the strains to native and deglycosylated lactoferrin. The effect on the viability of strains was measured by incubating strains in media containing lactoferrin as the sole carbon and nitrogen source. Siderophore production by strains was measured using an established assay. RESULTS: All the strains except the single strain of E. coli (Ecol8) were capable of binding to lactoferrin. The ocular isolate of H. influenzae showed strong affinity for lactoferrin. The P. aeruginosa strains and the strain of S. maltophilia showed significantly reduced (80%-100% reduction; P<0.05) binding to lactoferrin that had been enzymatically deglycosylated, whereas deglycosylation had no effect on the binding of other strains/species tested. Most strains were able to grow and produce siderophores in the presence of lactoferrin as the sole carbon and nitrogen source. CONCLUSIONS: The ability to bind to and grow on lactoferrin can be important for gram-negative pathogens that colonize the ocular environment, because this could allow bacteria to survive and propagate in the presence of tear fluid.
TI  - Rates of positive blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid cultures in children younger than 60 days during the vaccination era.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fever is a common reason children present to the emergency department. The goal of this study was to determine the rates and the etiology of bacterial infection in children younger than 2 months during the vaccination era. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review performed at a tertiary care hospital. Electronic medical records were used to identify patients who had a workup for fever/sepsis in the emergency department. The search was limited to identifying only children younger than 60 days. RESULTS: A total of 207 patients satisfied the inclusion/exclusion criteria. In children younger than 28 days, the blood culture-positive rate was 2.7% (range, 0.0%-6.4%), the urine culture-positive rate was 10.7% (range, 3.5%-17.8%), and the cerebrospinal fluid-positive rate (excluding enteroviral infections) was 0% (range, 0.0%-3.9%). In children 29 to 60 days, the blood culture-positive rate was 1.5% (range, 0.0%-3.6%), urine culture-positive rate was 8.5% (range, 3.7%-13.3%), and the cerebrospinal fluid-positive rate (excluding enteroviral infections) was 1.7% (range, 0.0%-5.0%). Urinary tract infections due to Escherichia coli were very common, whereas no cases of Haemophilus influenzae and one case of Streptococcus pneumoniae were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary tract infections due to E. coli are very common in this age group. The classic pathogens H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae were essentially nonexistent in this study possibly because of herd immunity obtained through current vaccination practices.
TI  - Inhibition of bacterial carbonic anhydrases and zinc proteases: from orphan targets to innovative new antibiotic drugs.
AB  - Zinc-containing enzymes, such as carbonic anhydrases (CAs) and metalloproteases (MPs) play critical functions in bacteria, being involved in various steps of their life cycle, which are important for survival, colonization, acquisition of nutrients for growth and proliferation, facilitation of dissemination, invasion and pathogenicity. The development of resistance to many classes of clinically used antibiotics emphasizes the need of new antibacterial drug targets to be explored. There is a wealth of data regarding bacterial CAs and zinc MPs present in many pathogenic species, such as Neisseria spp., Helycobacter pylori Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Brucella spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria spp, Vibrio spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella pneumophila, Streptomyces spp., Clostridium spp., Enterococcus spp., etc. Some of these enzymes have been cloned, purified and characterized by crystallographic techniques. However, for the moment, few potent and specific inhibitors for bacterial MPs have been reported except for Clostridium histolyticum collagenase, botulinum and tetanus neurotoxin and anthrax lethal factor, which will be reviewed in this article. Bacteria encode alpha-,beta-, and/or gamma-CA families, but up to now only the first two classes have been investigated in some detail in different species. The alpha-CAs from Neisseria spp. and H. pylori as well as the beta-class enzymes from E. coli, H. pylori, M. tuberculosis, Brucella spp., S. pneumoniae, S. enterica and H. influenzae have been cloned and characterized. The catalytic/inhibition mechanisms of these CAs are well understood as X-ray crystal structures are available for some of them, but no adducts of these enzymes with inhibitors have been characterized so far. In vitro and in vivo studies with various classes of inhibitors, such as anions, sulfonamides and sulfamates have been reported. Only for Neisseria spp., H. pylori, B. suis and S. pneumoniae CAs it has been possible to evidence inhibition of bacterial growth in vivo. Thus, bacterial CAs and MPs represent at this moment very promising targets for obtaining antibacterials devoid of the resistance problems of the clinically used such agents but further studies are needed to validate these and other less investigated enzymes as novel drug targets.
TI  - Anti-bacterial performance of azithromycin nanoparticles as colloidal drug delivery system against different gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - PURPOSE: Azithromycin (AZI) is a new macrolide antibiotic with a better activity  against intracellular gram negative bacteria in comparison with Erythromycin. The purpose of this research was to prepare AZI nanoparticles (NPs) using PLGA polymer and to compare the effectiveness of prepared nanoparticles with untreated AZI solution. METHODS: AZI NPs were prepared by Modified Quasi-Emulsion Solvent Diffusion method. The antibacterial activities of prepared NPs in comparison with AZI solution were assayed against indicator bacteria of Escherichia coli (PTCC 1330), Haemophilus influenzae (PTCC 1623) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (PTCC 1240) using agar well diffusion. Inhibition zone diameters (IZD) of nano-formulation were compared to the corresponding untreated AZI. Mean Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values of AZI were also determined using serial dilution method in nutrient broth medium. RESULTS: Mean IZD of nano-formulations for all indicator bacteria were significantly higher than that of untreated AZI (P<0.01). The enhanced antibacterial efficacy was more dominant in the gram positive species. The MIC values of NPs against the tested bacteria were reduced 8 times in comparison to those of untreated AZI. CONCLUSION: These results indicated an improved potency of AZI NPs which could be attributed to the modified surface characteristics as well as increased drug adsorption and uptake.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility profiles associated with bacterial meningitis among  children: a referral hospital-based study in Iran.
AB  - Bacterial meningitis continues to be associated with high morbidity and mortality rate worldwide, especially in the pediatric age group. This study was performed to identify the microbial etiologies of meningitis among 31 children, who were admitted in the Emergency Ward of a referral pediatric hospital in Iran. Culture identification showed that Streptococcus pneumoniae (12 subjects), Haemophilus influenzae (11 subjects) were the most common bacteria, followed by Escherichia coli (7 cases) and Neisseria meningitidis (only one case). Antibiotic susceptibility tests revealed that vancomycin had the best effect on S. pneumoniae in comparison with other antibiotics, whereas H. influenzae and E. coli were more susceptible to ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and ceftizoxime than other antibiotics. In conclusion, despite the advances in antibiotic therapy and vaccine development, bacterial meningitis still is a health problem. S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and N. meningitidis are the main sources of bacterial meningitis, but other organisms such as E. coli should also be suspected, when a case is admitted to a referral pediatric hospital.
TI  - Recurrent bacterial meningitis by three different pathogens in an isolated asplenic child.
AB  - Isolated congenital asplenia (ICA) is a rare condition at risk for overwhelming infection. When complicated by invasive infection, the mortality remains high, at greater than 60%. We describe a girl with ICA who developed recurrent meningitis by three different pathogens. The first, meningitis by Escherichia coli, occurred 4 days after premature birth. The other two pathogens were serotype 6B Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), at 18 and 25 months of age, respectively. The patient was successfully treated with prompt antimicrobial therapy in all episodes. Serum anti-polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP) and anti-6B-type pneumococcal antibodies were below the levels for protective activity after natural infections. Although anti-PRP antibody was significantly increased after Hib vaccination, two (6B and 19F) of seven serotype-specific pneumococcal antibodies were not elevated to protective levels after the second 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7). We, therefore, added a third PCV7. To our knowledge, this is the first neonatal ICA patient with invasive infection and the first case of bacterial meningitis occurring three times. Our findings indicate that monitoring of immune responses after natural infections and vaccinations, and reevaluations of vaccine schedule, are important for ICA patients to prevent subsequent invasive infections.
TI  - Applications of PCR (real-time and MassTag) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in diagnosis of respiratory infections and diarrheal illness among deployed U.S. military personnel during exercise Balikatan 2009, Philippines.
AB  - Laboratory-based surveillance for diarrheal and respiratory illness was conducted at the 2009 Republic of the Philippines-United States Balikatan exercise to determine the presence of specific pathogens endemic in the locations where the military exercises were conducted. Ten stool and 6 respiratory specimens were obtained from individuals meeting case definitions for diarrhea or respiratory illness. Stool specimens were frozen in dry ice and remotely tested using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for Rotavirus, Astrovirus, Adenovirus, Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia, and Cryptosporidium and polymerase chain reaction for enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, Shigella, Vibrio, Salmonella, and Norovirus. Eight (4 for Campylobacter jejuni, 2 for Campylobacter coli, 1 for Norovirus genogroup II, and 1 for both Campylobacter coli and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli) of 10 samples were positive for at least 1 enteric pathogen. MassTag polymerase chain reaction for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus groups A and B, human coronavirus-229E and human coronavirus-OC43, human metapneumovirus, enterovirus, human parainfluenza viruses 2,3, and 4a, human adenovirus, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Legionella pneumonia, and Mycoplasma pneumonia was done on respiratory specimens. Out of 6 samples, 3 tested positive for H. influenzae; 1 tested positive for both H. influenzae and human parainfluenza virus 3; and 2 tested negative. Laboratory-based surveillance can be useful in determining etiologies of diarrheal and respiratory illness of deployed military personnel.
TI  - Haemophilus influenzae uses the surface protein E to acquire human plasminogen and to evade innate immunity.
AB  - Pathogenic microbes acquire the human plasma protein plasminogen to their surface. In this article, we characterize binding of this important coagulation regulator to the respiratory pathogen nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae and identify the Haemophilus surface protein E (PE) as a new plasminogen-binding protein. Plasminogen binds dose dependently to intact bacteria and to purified PE. The plasminogen-PE interaction is mediated by lysine residues and is also affected by ionic strength. The H. influenzae PE knockout strain (nontypeable H. influenzae 3655Deltape) bound plasminogen with approximately 65% lower intensity as compared with the wild-type, PE-expressing strain. In addition, PE expressed ectopically on the surface of Escherichia coli also bound plasminogen. Plasminogen, either attached to intact H. influenzae or bound to PE, was accessible for urokinase plasminogen activator. The converted active plasmin cleaved the synthetic substrate S-2251, and the natural substrates fibrinogen and C3b. Using synthetic peptides that cover the complete sequence of the PE protein, the major plasminogen-binding region was localized to a linear 28-aa-long N-terminal peptide, which represents aa 41-68. PE binds plasminogen and also vitronectin, and the two human plasma proteins compete for PE binding. Thus, PE is a major plasminogen-binding protein of the Gram-negative bacterium H. influenzae, and when converted to plasmin, PE-bound plasmin aids in immune evasion and contributes to bacterial virulence.
TI  - Identification and characterization of inhibitors of Haemophilus influenzae acetohydroxyacid synthase.
AB  - Acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS), a potential target for antimicrobial agents, catalyzes the first common step in the biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids. The gene coding for the AHAS catalytic subunit from Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) was cloned, overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and purified. To identify new inhibitory scaffolds, we used a high-throughput screen to test 221 small diverse chemical compounds against Hi-AHAS. Compounds were selected for their ability to inhibit AHAS in vitro. The screen identified 3 compounds, each representing a structural class, as Hi-AHAS inhibitors with an IC(50) in the low micromolar range (4.4-14.6 muM). The chemical scaffolds of the three compounds were oxa-1-thia-4-aza-cyclopenta[b]naphthalene (KHG25229), phenyl-2,3-dihydro-isothiazole (KHG25386), and phenyl-pyrrolidine-3-carboxylic acid phenylamide (KHG25056). Further, molecular docking of the two most potent chemicals, KHG25229 and KHG25386, in Hi-AHAS yielded binding energies of -10.41 and -9.21 kcal/mol, respectively. The binding modes were consistent with inhibition mechanisms, as both chemicals oriented outside the active site. As the need for novel antibiotic classes to combat drug resistant bacteria increases, screening compounds that act against Hi-AHAS may assist in the identification of potential new anti-Hi drugs.
TI  - Novel non-specific DNA adenine methyltransferases.
AB  - The mom gene of bacteriophage Mu encodes an enzyme that converts adenine to N(6)-(1-acetamido)-adenine in the phage DNA and thereby protects the viral genome from cleavage by a wide variety of restriction endonucleases. Mu-like prophage sequences present in Haemophilus influenzae Rd (FluMu), Neisseria meningitidis type A strain Z2491 (Pnme1) and H. influenzae biotype aegyptius ATCC 11116 do not possess a Mom-encoding gene. Instead, at the position occupied by mom in Mu they carry an unrelated gene that encodes a protein with homology to DNA adenine N(6)-methyltransferases (hin1523, nma1821, hia5, respectively). Products of the hin1523, hia5 and nma1821 genes modify adenine residues to N(6)-methyladenine, both in vitro and in vivo. All of these enzymes catalyzed extensive DNA methylation; most notably the Hia5 protein caused the methylation of 61% of the adenines in lambda DNA. Kinetic analysis of oligonucleotide methylation suggests that all adenine residues in DNA, with the possible exception of poly(A)-tracts, constitute substrates for the Hia5 and Hin1523 enzymes. Their potential 'sequence specificity' could be summarized as AB or BA (where B = C, G or T). Plasmid DNA isolated from Escherichia coli cells overexpressing these novel DNA methyltransferases was resistant to cleavage by many restriction enzymes sensitive to adenine methylation.
TI  - Delineation of the Pasteurellaceae-specific GbpA-family of glutathione-binding proteins.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Gram-negative bacterium Haemophilus influenzae is a glutathione auxotroph and acquires the redox-active tripeptide by import. The dedicated glutathione transporter belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-transporter superfamily and displays more than 60% overall sequence identity with the well-studied dipeptide (Dpp) permease of Escherichia coli. The solute binding protein (SBP) that mediates glutathione transport in H. influenzae is a lipoprotein termed GbpA and is 54% identical to E. coli DppA, a well-studied member of family 5 SBP's. The discovery linking GbpA to glutathione import came rather unexpectedly as this import-priming SBP was previously annotated as a heme-binding protein (HbpA), and was thought to mediate heme acquisition. Nonetheless, although many SBP's have been implicated in more than one function, a prominent physiological role for GbpA and its partner permease in heme acquisition appears to be very unlikely. Here, we sought to characterize five representative GbpA homologs in an effort to delineate the novel GbpA-family of glutathione-specific family 5 SBPs and to further clarify their functional role in terms of ligand preferences. RESULTS: Lipoprotein and non-lipoprotein GbpA homologs were expressed in soluble form and substrate specificity was evaluated via a number of ligand binding assays. A physiologically insignificant affinity for hemin was observed for all five GbpA homologous test proteins. Three out of five test proteins were found to bind glutathione and some of its physiologically relevant derivatives with low- or submicromolar affinity. None of the tested SBP family 5 allocrites interacted with the remaining two GbpA test proteins. Structure-based sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis show that the two binding-inert GbpA homologs clearly form a separate phylogenetic cluster. To elucidate a structure-function rationale for this phylogenetic differentiation, we determined the crystal structure of one of the GbpA family outliers from H. parasuis. Comparisons thereof with the previously determined structure of GbpA in complex with oxidized glutathione reveals the structural basis for the lack of allocrite binding capacity, thereby explaining the outlier behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our studies provide for the first time a collective functional look on a novel, Pasteurellaceae-specific, SBP subfamily of glutathione binding proteins, which we now term GbpA proteins. Our studies strongly implicate GbpA family SBPs in the priming step of ABC-transporter-mediated translocation of useful forms of glutathione across the inner membrane, and rule out a general role for GbpA proteins in heme acquisition.
TI  - Evaluation of ceftobiprole activity against a variety of gram-negative pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive and beta-lactamase negative), and Klebsiella pneumoniae, in a rabbit meningitis model.
AB  - Ceftobiprole medocaril, a new cephalosporin, is highly active against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinical pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and penicillin-resistant pneumococci. In this study, we tested ceftobiprole against various Gram-negative pathogens in a rabbit meningitis model and determined its penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In this animal model, ceftobiprole produced an antibacterial activity similar to that of cefepime against an Escherichia coli strain, a Klebsiella pneumoniae strain, and a beta-lactamase-negative Haemophilus influenzae strain. Against a beta-lactamase-positive H. influenzae strain, ceftobiprole was significantly superior. The penetration of ceftobiprole through inflamed meninges reached about 16% of serum levels compared to about 2% of serum levels through uninflamed meninges.
TI  - Social-economic factors and irrational antibiotic use as reasons for antibiotic resistance of bacteria causing common childhood infections in primary healthcare.
AB  - The most prevalent childhood bacterial infections in primary healthcare are respiratory, gastrointestinal and urogenital infections. The main aim of this paper was to consider factors (socio-economic factors and irrational antibiotic use) that contribute to the development of bacterial resistance, as well as measures that resulted in a reduction of this problem. Computerized search through the Medline of published articles on antibiotic resistance from 1996 to 2011 in English or Serbian was completed in August 2011. Combinations of used terms were antimicrobial/antibacterial/antibiotic and resistance/susceptibility in pediatric/children, and Streptococcus pneumoniae/Streptococci/Haemophilus influenzae/Salmonellae/Escherichia coli/Shigella/Staphylococcus aureus as well as antibiotics/antimicrobials/antibacterials and consumption/utilization/use. In many developing countries, antibiotic dispensing and its use in medicine, cattle breeding and agriculture are inadequately regulated, or existing laws are not being appropriately implemented. In addition, human travel contributes to antimicrobial drug resistance around the world. All of these factors have led to a very high level of bacterial resistance. On the contrary, in countries with a clearly defined and implemented legal framework concerning antibiotic prescribing, dispensing and utilization, the use of antibiotics is under constant surveillance. That resulted in a significantly lower antibacterial resistance. In conclusion, bacterial resistance could be reduced by the implementation of systemic and long-term measures at a country level as well as at all levels of healthcare. In order to reduce bacterial resistance, antibiotic use needs to be precisely regulated, and regulations should be coherent with practice. The international community must have a more active role in solving this global problem.
TI  - In vitro validation of acetyltransferase activity of GlmU as an antibacterial target in Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - GlmU is a bifunctional enzyme that is essential for bacterial growth, converting  D-glucosamine 1-phosphate into UDP-GlcNAc via acetylation and subsequent uridyl transfer. A biochemical screen of AstraZeneca's compound library using GlmU of Escherichia coli identified novel sulfonamide inhibitors of the acetyltransferase reaction. Steady-state kinetics, ligand-observe NMR, isothermal titration calorimetry, and x-ray crystallography showed that the inhibitors were competitive with acetyl-CoA substrate. Iterative chemistry efforts improved biochemical potency against gram-negative isozymes 300-fold and afforded antimicrobial activity against a strain of Haemophilus influenzae lacking its major efflux pump. Inhibition of precursor incorporation into bacterial macromolecules was consistent with the antimicrobial activity being caused by disruption of peptidoglycan and fatty acid biosyntheses. Isolation and characterization of two different resistant mutant strains identified the GlmU acetyltransferase domain as the molecular target. These data, along with x-ray co-crystal structures, confirmed the binding mode of the inhibitors and explained their relative lack of potency against gram-positive GlmU isozymes. This is the first example of antimicrobial compounds mediating their growth inhibitory effects specifically via GlmU.
TI  - RbsB (NTHI_0632) mediates quorum signal uptake in nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae strain 86-028NP.
AB  - Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) is a respiratory commensal and opportunistic pathogen, which persists within biofilms on airway mucosal surfaces. For many species, biofilm formation is impacted by quorum signalling. Our prior work shows that production of autoinducer-2 (AI-2) promotes biofilm development and persistence for NTHI 86-028NP. NTHI 86-028NP encodes an ABC transporter annotated as a ribose transport system that includes a protein (RbsB) with similarity to the Escherichia coli LsrB and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans RbsB proteins that bind AI-2. In this study, inactivation of rbsB significantly reduced uptake of AI-2 and the AI-2 precursor dihydroxypentanedione (DPD) by NTHI 86-028NP. Moreover, DPD uptake was not competitively inhibited by ribose or other pentose sugars. Transcript levels of rbsB increased in response to DPD and as bacteria approached stationary-phase growth. The NTHI 86-028NP rbsB mutant also formed biofilms with significantly reduced thickness and total biomass and reduced surface phosphorylcholine, similar to a luxS mutant. Infection studies revealed that loss of rbsB impaired bacterial persistence in the chinchilla middle ear, similar to our previous results with luxS mutants. Based on these data, we conclude that in NTHI 86-028NP, RbsB is a LuxS/AI-2 regulated protein that is required for uptake of and response to AI-2.
TI  - Differential effect of prior influenza infection on alveolar macrophage phagocytosis of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli: involvement of interferon-gamma production.
AB  - The influenza A virus is one of the main causes of respiratory infection. Although influenza virus infection alone can result in pneumonia, secondary bacterial infection combined with the virus is the major cause of morbidity and mortality. Interestingly, while influenza infection increases susceptibility to some bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and Haemophilus influenzae, other bacteria such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Klebsiella pneumoniae are not associated with influenza infection. The reason for this discrepancy is not known. In this study, it was found that prior influenza virus infection inhibits murine alveolar macrophage phagocytosis of S. aureus but not of E. coli. Here, the mechanism for this inhibition is elucidated: prior influenza virus infection strongly increases interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) production. Furthermore, it was shown that IFN-gamma differentially affects alveolar macrophage phagocytosis of S. aureus and E. coli. The findings of the present study explain how influenza virus infection increases susceptibility to some bacteria, such as S. aureus, but not others, and provides evidence that IFN-gamma might be a promising target for protecting the human population from secondary bacterial infection by influenza.
TI  - Exploiting bacterial glycosylation machineries for the synthesis of a Lewis antigen-containing glycoprotein.
AB  - Glycoproteins constitute a class of compounds of increasing importance for pharmaceutical applications. The manipulation of bacterial protein glycosylation systems from Gram-negative bacteria for the synthesis of recombinant glycoproteins is a promising alternative to the current production methods. Proteins carrying Lewis antigens have been shown to have potential applications for the treatment of diverse autoimmune diseases. In this work, we developed a mixed approach consisting of in vivo and in vitro steps for the synthesis of glycoproteins containing the Lewis x antigen. Using glycosyltransferases from Haemophilus influenzae, we engineered Escherichia coli to assemble a tetrasaccharide on the lipid carrier undecaprenylphosphate. This glycan was transferred in vivo from the lipid to a carrier protein by the Campylobacter jejuni oligosaccharyltransferase PglB. The glycoprotein was then fucosylated in vitro by a truncated fucosyltransferase from Helicobacter pylori. Diverse mass spectrometry techniques were used to confirm the structure of the glycan. The strategy presented here could be adapted in the future for the synthesis of diverse glycoproteins. Our experiments demonstrate that bacterial enzymes can be exploited for the production of glycoproteins carrying glycans present in human cells for potential therapeutic applications.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of a glycolipid-rich extract and active principle from Nunavik collections of the macroalgae Fucus evanescens C. Agardh (Fucaceae).
AB  - This study investigated the antibacterial activity of glycolipid-rich extracts of the brown macroalga Fucus evanescens in cell culture. Accessions were collected on the Arctic coast of Ungava Bay, Nunavik, Quebec. The crude ethyl acetate extract of these accessions showed strong antibacterial activity (>/=4 log(10) cfu) against Hemophilus influenzae , Legionella pneumophila , Propionibacterium acnes (ATCC and clinical isolate), and Streptococcus pyogenes at 100 microg/mL. This algal extract inhibited by 3 log(10) Clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , whereas Bacillus cereus , Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not significantly affected. Further investigations of the activity of a glycolipid-rich fraction, extracted with dichloromethane, against Propionibacterium acnes showed an MIC(100) of 50 microg/mL, with an inhibition of more than 99% at only 7.8 microg/mL. The main active compound, a beta-d-galactosyl O-linked glycolipid, was synthesized for the bioassay and showed an MIC(100) of 50 microg/mL but lost its activity more quickly with only 50% of inhibition at 12.5 microg/mL. Therefore, the semipurified F. evanescens extract could be a good choice for future research into the development of alternative treatments for acne therapy.
TI  - Bacterial carbonic anhydrases as drug targets: toward novel antibiotics?
AB  - Carbonic anhydrases (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1) are metalloenzymes which catalyze the hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons. Many pathogenic bacteria encode such enzymes belonging to the alpha-, beta-, and/or gamma-CA families. In the last decade, the alpha-CAs from Neisseria spp. and Helicobacter pylori as well as the beta-class enzymes from Escherichia coli, H. pylori,Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Brucella spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, and Haemophilus influenzae have been cloned and characterized in detail. For some of these enzymes the X-ray crystal structures were determined, and in vitro and in vivo inhibition studies with various classes of inhibitors, such as anions, sulfonamides and sulfamates reported. Although efficient inhibitors have been reported for many such enzymes, only for Neisseria spp., H. pylori, B. suis, and S. pneumoniae enzymes it has been possible to evidence inhibition of bacterial growth in vivo. Thus, bacterial CAs represent promising targets for obtaining antibacterials devoid of the resistance problems of the clinically used such agents but further studies are needed to validate these and other less investigated enzymes as novel drug targets.
TI  - Susceptibility of bacterial isolates from community-acquired infections in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia to macrolide antibiotics.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on the susceptibility of common community pathogens in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia to the macrolide antibiotics. METHODS: Inclusion criteria required that isolates were collected since 2004 to ensure results were of contemporary relevance. The data were aggregated by region, age group and sterility of site of culture sample. RESULTS: A total of 51 studies were identified, which reported the macrolide antimicrobial susceptibilities of common bacterial pathogens isolated since 2004. In general, there was less macrolide resistance in African than in Asian isolates. Most African studies reported high levels of macrolide susceptibility in Streptococcus pneumoniae, whereas most Chinese studies reported high levels of resistance. There was very little information available for Gram-negative organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Susceptibility of the pneumococcus to macrolides in SSA remains high in many areas, and good activity of azithromycin has been shown against Salmonellae spp. in Asia. In urban areas where high antibiotic consumption is prevalent, there was evidence of increased resistance to macrolides. However, there is no information on susceptibility from large areas in both continents.
TI  - Biofilms can be dispersed by focusing the immune system on a common family of bacterial nucleoid-associated proteins.
AB  - Bacteria that cause chronic and/or recurrent diseases often rely on a biofilm lifestyle. The foundation of the biofilm structure is the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) that acts as a barrier to both effectors of the immune system and antimicrobial agents. Recent work has highlighted extracellular DNA (eDNA) as a key component common to many pathogenic biofilms. Here, we show that the DNABII family of proteins, well known for their strong structural influences on intracellular DNA, was also critical for the integrity of the EPS matrix of biofilms that contain eDNA. In fact, antisera derived against a purified Escherichia coli DNABII family member rapidly disrupts the biofilm EPS formed by multiple human pathogens in vitro. In addition, when a member of this family of proteins was used as an immunogen in an animal model in which the bacteria had already formed a robust biofilm at the site of infection, the resultant targeted immune response strongly ameliorated this biofilm disease in vivo. Finally, this methodology to debulk the biofilm of EPS was shown to work synergistically with otherwise ineffective traditional anti-microbial approaches in vitro. We discuss the prospects for targeting DNABII family members as a potential universal strategy for treating biofilm diseases.
TI  - Determination of disk diffusion and MIC quality control guidelines for JNJ-Q2, a  novel quinolone.
AB  - JNJ-Q2 is a novel fluorinated 4-quinolone in development for treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. This quality control (QC) study was performed to establish ranges for control strains: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 (0.004 to 0.015 mug/ml), Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 (0.015 to 0.06 mug/ml), Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (0.5 to 2 mug/ml and 17 to 23 mm), Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 (0.008 to 0.03 mug/ml and 30 to 36 mm), Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247 (0.002 to 0.015 mug/ml and 31 to 39 mm), Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 (0.004 to 0.015 mug/ml and 28 to 35 mm), and S. aureus ATCC 25923 (32 to 38 mm). These ranges will be crucial in evaluating JNJ-Q2 potency as it progresses through clinical trial development.
TI  - [Comparative studies on the composition and antibiotic-resistance of pathogenic bacteria between children with community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This research was to explore the difference between children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in the composition and antibiotic-resistance of pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: 241 CAP and 116 HAP with positive sputum culture who were hospitalized from January to December in 2008 in Children's Hospital Affiliated to Suzhou University were selected in this study. The bacteria were identified by traditionally manual method and antibiotic sensitivity tests were performed by K-B method. The chi-square or Fisher's exact test were used for statistical test. RESULTS: In 241 CAP, Streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenza accounted for (42.2%, 106/251) and (12.4%, 31/251) infection, respectively; however in 116 HAP, Enterobacteriaceae and Non-fermenters accounted for (88.2%, 127/144). In addition, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus weren't isolated, however, its detection rate was 66.7% in HAP. The drug resistance was 1.5 times higher in HAP than that in CAP for several types of antibiotics, such as ceftazidime (37.5% (6/16) vs 75.6% (31/41)), cefepime (37.5% (6/16) vs 78.0% (32/41)), aztreonam (50.0% (8/16) vs 90.2% (37/41)), cefoperazone/sulbactam (12.5% (2/16) vs 51.2% (21/41)) and piperacillin/tazobactam (12.5% (2/16) vs 56.0% (23/41)). Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from HAP had higher drug resistance than that isolated from CAP against some antibiotics, for example, gentamicin (0 vs 63.6% (7/11)), SMZ + TMP (20.0% (1/5) vs 63.6% (7/11)) and cefoperazone/sulbactam (0 vs 54.5% (6/11)). We also found Enterobacter cloacae isolated from HAP showed high drug resistance than that isolated from CAP against imipenem (0 vs 46.7% (7/15)), aztreonam (9.1% (1/11) vs 60.0% (9/15)) and cefoperazone (18.2% (2/11) vs 80.0% (12/15)) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from HAP had higher resistance than that from CAP against gentamicin (0 vs 50.0% (9/18)), amikacin (0 vs 38.9% (7/18)), ceftazidime (0 vs 55.6% (10/18)), cefepime (0 vs 50.0% (9/18)) and cefoperazone (33.3% (2/6) vs 94.4% (17/18)). The detection rates of ESBLs for Escherichia coli were 84.6% (11/13) and 93.3% (14/15) in CAP and HAP, respectively (chi(2) = 0.553, P > 0.05); while for Klebsiella pneumoniae, they were 81.3% (13/16) and 95.1% (39/41), respectively (chi(2) = 2.767, P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: CAP was mainly comprised of Streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenza; while HAP was mainly comprised of Enterobacteriaceae and Non-fermenters. The drug resistance of gram-negative bacilli was higher in HAP than that in CAP.
TI  - Comparative activity of tigecycline and tetracycline on Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria revealed by a multicentre study in four North European countries.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study involves a multicentre surveillance of tigecycline and tetracycline activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria from primary care centres (PCCs), general hospital wards (GHWs) and intensive care units (ICUs) in Denmark (n = 9), Finland (n = 10), Norway (n = 7) and Sweden (n = 19). METHODS: The hospitals were each asked to test 30 consecutive Gram-positive and 30 Gram-negative clinical isolates. Supportive information accompanying each isolate included the study centre, ward level (PCC, GHW, or ICU), patient identification and source of the isolate. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for tetracycline and tigecycline were determined with the Etest. RESULTS: The isolates collected comprised 1610 Gram-negative and 1767 Gram-positive clinical isolates. The study showed low rates of non-susceptibility (intermediate (I) and resistant (R)) to tigecycline: <1% in Escherichia coli, though other Enterobacteriaceae showed higher rates (Enterobacter cloacae (7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9%) and Serratia spp. (23%)). The overall non-susceptibility rate for tigecycline in Enterobacteriaceae with species-related breakpoints for tigecycline was 6% (4% excluding Serratia spp.). The activity of tigecycline against Haemophilus influenzae and Acinetobacter spp. was high with a MIC(50) of 0.25 mg/l and MIC(90) of 1 mg/l. The prevalence of non-susceptibility to tigecycline among Gram-positive bacteria was <1%. The corresponding figure for tetracycline was 14%. The activity of tigecycline against Streptococcus pneumoniae was high with MIC(50) and MIC(90) of 0.125 mg/l. CONCLUSION: Tigecycline showed good overall in vitro activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates, including both tetracycline-susceptible and resistant isolates. Most non-susceptibility to tigecycline among Enterobacteriaceae other than E. coli was I (6%), rather than R (<1%). This indicates a problem setting interpretive species-related tigecycline breakpoints for Enterobacteriaceae other than E. coli.
TI  - Bacteriological differences between COPD exacerbation and community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the differences in pathogen distribution and antibiotic susceptibility between patients with COPD exacerbation and patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and develop guidance for antibiotic treatment of those conditions. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 586 COPD-exacerbation patients and 345 community-acquired-pneumonia patients from January 2007 to December 2008, including sputum culture results, antibiotic susceptibilities of the microorganisms, and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: 276 (47%) of the COPD-exacerbation patients, and 183 (53%) of the community-acquired-pneumonia patients had a positive sputum culture. In order, the most common pathogens in the COPD-exacerbation patients were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Haemophilus influenzae. The most common pathogens in the community-acquired-pneumonia patients were Streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenzae, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: P. aeruginosa was the most common pathogen in our patients with COPD exacerbation, and S. pneumoniae was the most common in our patients with community-acquired pneumonia. P. aeruginosa is especially common in the patients with serious or extremely serious COPD.
TI  - Evaluation of the effect of bacterial efflux pumps on the antibacterial activity  of the novel fluoroquinolone besifloxacin.
AB  - This study examined the susceptibility of a variety of wild-type strains and efflux pump mutants to besifloxacin and the comparator agents sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, moxifloxacin, tetracycline, and ethidium bromide. Organisms tested included Staphylococcus aureus (mepA or norA), Streptococcus pneumoniae (pmrA, patB), Escherichia coli (acrAB::Tn903, tolC::Tn10), Haemophilus influenzae (acrAB) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mepAB-oprM, oprM::OmegaHg(r) rpsL). The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of besifloxacin and comparators were also measured in the presence of the efflux pump inhibitors reserpine, carbonyl cyanide mchlorophenyl- hydrazone, or sodium orthovanadate. Overall, very few meaningful changes (>2-fold) in besifloxacin MIC values resulted from the presence of efflux pump mutations or efflux pump inhibitors. In summary, the novel fluoroquinolone besifloxacin is no exception to the observation that newer fluoroquinolones are generally less affected by efflux pump-mediated resistance than older fluoroquinolones.
TI  - [Distributions and spreads of antimicrobial drug-resistant microorganisms in Saga prefecture].
AB  - We investigated the distribution of drug-resistant organisms to clarify transmission of the organisms. Drug-resistant organisms were surveyed in 12 facilities in 4 districts of Saga prefecture for 2 years, and were analyzed by beta-lactamase typing, antimicrobial susceptibility tests and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The number of isolates was 111,505 for the 2 years. Questionnaires for drug-resistant organisms revealed that Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was 64.1% of S. aureus, penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP) or penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) 60.1% of S. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistent Haemophilus inflluenzae (BLNAR) 19.4% of H. influenzae, Metallo-beta-Lactamase (MBL) 0.1% of gram-negative bacilli, multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRP) 0.6% of P. aeruginosa and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing organisms 8.0% and 3.1% of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively. PFGE analysis of ESBL E. coli revealed that 33 isolates collected from 7 facilities in 3 districts belonged to the same one group, indicating that this strain is transferred between different hospitals in different saga districts. Investigations of distribution of drug-resistant organisms in not only each hospitals but also in the first and the second medical areas are important for controls of healthcare-associated infections and antibiotic prescriptions.
TI  - Expression and regulation of antimicrobial peptide psoriasin (S100A7) at the ocular surface and in the lacrimal apparatus.
AB  - PURPOSE: Psoriasin, originally isolated from psoriasis as an overexpressed molecule of unknown function, has recently been identified as a principal Escherichia coli-killing antimicrobial peptide of healthy skin. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression and antimicrobial role of psoriasin at the ocular surface and in the lacrimal apparatus. METHODS: Different tissues of the lacrimal apparatus and ocular surface were systematically analyzed by means of RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry for their ability to express and produce psoriasin. The inducibility and regulation of psoriasin were studied in human corneal as well as conjunctival epithelial cell lines after challenge with ocular pathogens and proinflammatory cytokines. Real-time RT-PCR was performed to evaluate the expression and induction of psoriasin. In addition, tear fluid obtained from different healthy volunteers was examined by ELISA for its psoriasin concentration. RESULTS: RT-PCR and Western blot analyses revealed a constitutive expression of psoriasin in cornea, conjunctiva, nasolacrimal ducts, and lacrimal gland. Immunohistochemistry showed strong staining of meibomian glands for psoriasin. No induction of psoriasin was observed after stimulation with supernatants of E. coli, whereas supernatants of Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae significantly increased the psoriasin mRNA expression. Stimulation with IL-1beta and VEGF also strongly increased psoriasin transcription. The highest amounts of psoriasin protein were detected in the tear fluid (~170 ng/mL) of healthy volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that psoriasin is produced by the structures of the ocular surface and is part of the innate immune system at the ocular surface and tear film.
TI  - Haemophilus influenzae protein E recognizes the C-terminal domain of vitronectin  and modulates the membrane attack complex.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae protein E (PE) is a 16 kDa adhesin that induces a pro-inflammatory immune response in lung epithelial cells. The active epithelial binding region comprising amino acids PE 84-108 also interferes with complement-mediated bacterial killing by capturing vitronectin (Vn) that prevents complement deposition and formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). Here, the interaction between PE and Vn was characterized using site-directed mutagenesis. Protein E variants were produced both in soluble forms and in surface-expressed molecules on Escherichia coli. Mutations within PE(84-108) in the full-length molecule revealed that K85 and R86 residues were important for the Vn binding. Bactericidal activity against H. influenzae was higher in human serum pre-treated with full-length PE as compared with serum incubated with PE(K85E, R86D) , suggesting that PE quenched Vn. A series of truncated Vn molecules revealed that the C-terminal domain comprising Vn(353-363) harboured the major binding region for PE. Interestingly, MAC deposition was significantly higher on mutants devoid of PE due to a decreased Vn-binding capacity when compared with wild-type H. influenzae. Our results define a fine-tuned interaction between H. influenzae and the innate immune system, and identify the mode of control of the MAC that is important for pathogen complement evasion.
TI  - Comparative ceftaroline activity tested against pathogens associated with community-acquired pneumonia: results from an international surveillance study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To document the spectrum of activity of ceftaroline, the active form  of the prodrug, ceftaroline fosamil, a new cephalosporin with anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcal activity, against a surveillance collection of clinical isolates obtained from the USA and Europe during 2008-09. METHODS: A selected group of species associated with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP; 6496 of 17 326 monitored strains) were tested for susceptibility in a central laboratory using CLSI broth microdilution methods. Organisms were sampled from 55 medical centres, 27 in the USA and 28 (12 countries) in Europe. Ceftaroline and comparator agents were tested and interpretations of MIC endpoints made by applying current CLSI (2010) and EUCAST (2010) breakpoint criteria. RESULTS: Against 1340 Streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftaroline inhibited all isolates at </=0.5 mg/L (MIC(50/90), </=0.008/0.12 mg/L) and was 8-fold more active than ceftriaxone (MIC(90), 1 mg/L; only 79.2% coverage at EUCAST breakpoint). Haemophilus influenzae (n = 584; MIC(50/90), </=0.008/0.015 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 377; MIC(50/90), 0.03-0.06/0.12 mg/L) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 590; MIC(50/90), 0.5/1 mg/L) were very susceptible to ceftaroline, regardless of beta-lactamase production or multidrug resistance (MDR) patterns. The potency of ceftaroline against three species of Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae) was similar to that of ceftriaxone, ceftazidime and piperacillin/tazobactam. Only modest differences in rates of ceftaroline susceptibility (breakpoint </=2 mg/L) were noted with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-negative Enterobacteriaceae strains between the USA and Europe (97.9% versus 97.0% for E. coli). Ceftaroline, like ceftriaxone, was not active against ceftazidime-resistant E. coli (10.2%-26.2% susceptible at </=2 mg/L) or K. pneumoniae (5.3%-11.2%). CONCLUSIONS: The ceftaroline surveillance for 2008-09 (USA and Europe) documented low MIC(50/90) values for S. aureus isolates at 0.5/1 and 0.25/1 mg/L, respectively. More importantly, ceftaroline MIC(90) results for S. pneumoniae (0.12 mg/L), H. influenzae (0.015 mg/L) and M. catarrhalis (0.12 mg/L) were very low, all MICs being </=0.5 mg/L. Ceftaroline exhibited promising high potency and wide coverage against Gram-positive and -negative pathogens known to cause CAP, especially isolates of MDR pneumococci and methicillin-resistant S. aureus.
TI  - Sitafloxacin: in bacterial infections.
AB  - Sitafloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial with in vitro activity against a  broad range of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including anaerobic bacteria, as well as against atypical pathogens. It is approved in Japan for use in a number of bacterial infections caused by sitafloxacin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, other Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Proteus spp., Morganella morganii, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella pneumophila, Peptostreptococcus spp., Prevotella spp., Porphyromonas spp., Fusobacterium spp., Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. In terms of clinical efficacy, oral sitafloxacin was noninferior to oral levofloxacin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia or an infectious exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract disease, noninferior to oral tosufloxacin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, and noninferior to oral levofloxacin in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, according to the results of randomized, double-blind, multicentre, noninferiority trials. Noncomparative studies demonstrated the efficacy of oral sitafloxacin in otorhinolaryngological infections, urethritis in men, C. trachomatis-associated cervicitis in women and odontogenic infections. Gastrointestinal disorders and laboratory abnormalities were the most commonly occurring adverse reactions in patients receiving oral sitafloxacin. Adverse reactions reported in sitafloxacin recipients in the active comparator trials were of mild to moderate severity.
TI  - Ultra-fast and sensitive detection of non-typhoidal Salmonella using microwave-accelerated metal-enhanced fluorescence ("MAMEF").
AB  - Certain serovars of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica cause invasive disease (e.g., enteric fever, bacteremia, septicemia, meningitis, etc.) in humans and constitute a global public health problem. A rapid, sensitive diagnostic test is needed to allow prompt initiation of therapy in individual patients and for measuring disease burden at the population level. An innovative and promising new rapid diagnostic technique is microwave-accelerated metal-enhanced fluorescence (MAMEF). We have adapted this assay platform to detect the chromosomal oriC locus common to all Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovars. We have shown efficient lysis of biologically relevant concentrations of Salmonella spp. suspended in bacteriological media using microwave-induced lysis. Following lysis and DNA release, as little as 1 CFU of Salmonella in 1 ml of medium can be detected in <30 seconds. Furthermore the assay is sensitive and specific: it can detect oriC from Salmonella serovars Typhi, Paratyphi A, Paratyphi B, Paratyphi C, Typhimurium, Enteritidis and Choleraesuis but does not detect Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae or Acinetobacter baumanii. We have also performed preliminary experiments using a synthetic Salmonella oriC oligonucleotide suspended in whole human blood and observed rapid detection when the sample was diluted 1:1 with PBS. These pre-clinical data encourage progress to the next step to detect Salmonella in blood (and other ordinarily sterile, clinically relevant body fluids).
TI  - Bacteriology and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of peritonsillar abscess.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Peritonsillar abscess is a common complication of acute tonsillitis. Its management consists of aspiration or surgical drainage followed by appropriate antibiotics. Appropriate antibiotic treatment depends on the common organisms associated with infection and their antibiotic sensitivity pattern in local scenario. METHODS: Pus samples aspirated from diagnosed cases of peritonsillar abscess and submitted for culture and sensitivity in last two years were included in this study. Identification of different microorganisms was made on the basis of the microscopic findings, observation of their colony morphology and standard biochemical reactions. Susceptibility pattern to commonly used antibiotics were determined by Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. RESULTS: Altogether 24 pus samples were included in the study. Positive culture was obtained from 18 samples. Among them one organism was isolated from 13 samples whereas from five samples multiple organisms were isolated. From six samples no organisms could be cultured. Altogether Streptococcus pyogenes was isolated from 12 samples and Staphylococcus aureus from five samples. Other isolated organisms included Haemophlilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus species. Penicillin was effective for Streptococcus pyogenes whereas Staphylococcus aureus was resistant to it. Cloxacillin was found to be effective for Staphylococcus aureus. Ciprofloxacin and Ceftazidime were found to be effective for both organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus were more commonly associated with peritonsillar abscess. Streptococcus pyogenes were sensitive to penicillin but all Staphylococcus aureus were resistant to it. This fact should be considered in clinical practice for management of peritonsillar abscess.
TI  - [Incidence and characteristics of bronchial colonisation in patient with lung cancer: a retrospective study of 388 cases].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bronchial colonisation is frequently reported in patients with lung cancer. These colonisations could influence patient therapeutic management and prognosis. The aim of our study is refine incidence and nature of bronchial colonisations in patients presenting with lung cancer. METHODS: Three hundred and eighty-eight patients with lung cancer underwent a flexible bronchoscopy at the time of diagnosis. Among them, 216 patients had a bacteriological, mycobacteriological and fungal investigation. Type and frequency of these colonisations were analyzed. RESULTS: Potential pathogens were found in 39.8% of samples, including mainly 39.8% of Gram-negative bacilli (Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter sp., Escherichia coli). In addition, we found 0.9% of mycobacteria and 13.9% of Candida albicans. Among these 216 patients where microbiological analysis was performed, patient features and tumor stage were not significantly correlated to microbial colonisation. CONCLUSIONS: Colonisation of airways is frequently reported when a lung cancer is diagnosed. Our data suggest that bronchial colonisation should be prospectively collected due to its potential interest in the management of lung cancer patients.
TI  - [Infective complications in patients with lung cancer].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study was aimed at analyzing the site, kind and type of infection which develop in patients having lung cancer at hospital treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical data of the patients hospitalized for lung cancer were analyzed at the Clinic for Lung Diseases and Tuberculosis in Knez Selo in the period from January 2002 till December 2007. A great number of patients (1296-75.9%) had non-small cell lung cancer. In 1708 patients with lung cancer, 773 febrile episodes were recorded, i.e. 687 states of infections. RESULTS: Most of the infections were recorded in the tracheobronchial tree (60.9%). The infection was confirmed microbiologically in 38% of infectious states. Predominant Gram positive pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus, but among Gram negative pathogens there were Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae. DISCUSSION: A significantly better therapy response to antibiotics was found in the group of patients where microbiological agents were isolated (p < 0.05). The predominant site of infection in the patients with lung cancer is the tracheobronchial tree without a significant difference between frequency of Gram positive and Gram negative pathogens.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria in 2006].
AB  - We determined MICs of antibacterial agents against 1280 clinical strains of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (19 genus or species) isolated at 16 Japanese facilities in 2006. MICs were determined using mostly broth microdilution method and antibacterial activity was assessed. Strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) accounted for 3.7% of Escherichia coli, 2.7% of Klebsiella spp., and 11.4% of Proteus spp. Notably, 18.8% of Proteus mirabilis was found to produce ESBL higher than 16.7% in 2004. This result was higher extremely than other species. Among Haemophilus influenzae, only 1.2% produced beta-lactamase and 62.8% that increased compared with 57.7% in 2004, were beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant strains when classified by penicillin-binding protein 3 mutation. Although few antibacterial agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa have potent activity, only three agents--doripenem, ciprofloxacin, and tobramycin-showed an MIC90 of 4 microg/mL. Of all P aeruginosa strains, 5.7% were resistant to six or more agents of nine antipseudomonal agents, a decrease compared to 8.7% in 2004. Against other glucose-non-fermentative Gram-negative bacteria, the activity of most antibacterial agents was similar to that in 2004.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals in 2009.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline and comparative agents were determined for a collection of the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens from hospital-associated patients across Canada in 2009 as part of the ongoing CANWARD surveillance study. In total, 4,546 isolates from 15 sentinel Canadian hospital laboratories were tested using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method. Compared with other cephalosporins, including ceftobiprole, cefepime, and ceftriaxone, ceftaroline exhibited the greatest potency against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), with a MIC(9)(0) of 0.25 mug/ml. Ceftaroline also demonstrated greater potency than ceftobiprole against community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (MIC(9)(0), 0.5 mug/ml) and health care-associated MRSA (MIC(9)(0), 1 mug/ml) and was at least 4-fold more active than other cephalosporins against Staphylococcus epidermidis; all isolates of MSSA and MRSA tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=1 mug/ml). Against streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftaroline MICs (MIC(9)(0), </=0.03 mug/ml) were comparable to those of ceftobiprole; however, against penicillin-nonsusceptible, macrolide-nonsusceptible, and multidrug-nonsusceptible isolates of S. pneumoniae, ceftaroline demonstrated 2- to 4-fold and 4- to 16-fold more potent activities than those of ceftobiprole and ceftriaxone, respectively. All isolates of S. pneumoniae tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=0.25 mug/ml). Among Gram-negative isolates, ceftaroline demonstrated potent activity (MIC(9)(0), </=0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli (92.2% of isolates were susceptible), Klebsiella pneumoniae (94.1% of isolates were susceptible), Proteus mirabilis (97.7% of isolates were susceptible), and Haemophilus influenzae (100% of isolates were susceptible). Ceftaroline demonstrated less potent activity (MIC(9)(0), >/=4 mug/ml) against Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Overall, ceftaroline demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a recent collection of the most frequently encountered Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates from patients attending hospitals across Canada in 2009.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a heme periplasmic-binding protein in Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - Haemophilus ducreyi, a gram-negative and heme-dependent bacterium, is the causative agent of chancroid, a genital ulcer sexually transmitted infection. Heme acquisition in H. ducreyi proceeds via a receptor mediated process in which the initial event involves binding of hemoglobin and heme to their cognate outer membrane proteins, HgbA and TdhA, respectively. Following this specific interaction, the fate of the periplasmic deposited heme is unclear. Using protein expression profiling of the H. ducreyi periplasmic proteome, a periplasmic-binding protein, termed hHbp, was identified whose expression was enhanced under heme-limited conditions. The gene encoding this protein was situated in a locus displaying genetic characteristics of an ABC transporter. The purified protein bound heme in a dose-dependent and saturable manner and this binding was specifically competitively inhibited by heme. The hhbp gene functionally complemented an Escherichia coli heme uptake mutant. Expression of the heme periplasmic-binding protein was detected in a limited survey of H. ducreyi and H. influenzae clinical strains. These results indicate that the passage of heme into the cytoplasm of H. ducreyi involves a heme dedicated ABC transporter.
TI  - Identification of a chitin-induced small RNA that regulates translation of the tfoX gene, encoding a positive regulator of natural competence in Vibrio cholerae.
AB  - The tfoX (also called sxy) gene product is the central regulator of DNA uptake in the naturally competent bacteria Haemophilus influenzae and Vibrio cholerae. However, the mechanisms regulating tfoX gene expression in both organisms are poorly understood. Our previous studies revealed that in V. cholerae, chitin disaccharide (GlcNAc)(2) is needed to activate the transcription and translation of V. cholerae tfoX (tfoX(VC)) to induce natural competence. In this study, we screened a multicopy library of V. cholerae DNA fragments necessary for translational regulation of tfoX(VC). A clone carrying the VC2078-VC2079 intergenic region, designated tfoR, increased the expression of a tfoX(VC)::lacZ translational fusion constructed in Escherichia coli. Using a tfoX(VC)::lacZ reporter system in V. cholerae, we confirmed that tfoR positively regulated tfoX(VC) expression at the translational level. Deletion of tfoR abolished competence for exogenous DNA even when (GlcNAc)(2) was provided. The introduction of a plasmid clone carrying the tfoR(+) gene into the tfoR deletion mutant complemented the competence deficiency. We also found that the tfoR gene encodes a 102-nucleotide small RNA (sRNA), which was transcriptionally activated in the presence of (GlcNAc)(2). Finally, we showed that this sRNA activated translation from tfoX(VC) mRNA in a highly purified in vitro translation system. Taking these results together, we propose that in the presence of (GlcNAc)(2), TfoR sRNA is expressed to activate the translation of tfoX(VC), which leads to the induction of natural competence.
TI  - Insights into substrate gating in H. influenzae rhomboid.
AB  - Rhomboids are a remarkable class of serine proteases that are embedded in lipid membranes. These membrane-bound enzymes play key roles in cellular signaling events, and disruptions in these events can result in numerous disease pathologies, including hereditary blindness, type 2 diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and epithelial cancers. Recent crystal structures of rhomboids from Escherichia coli have focused on how membrane-bound substrates gain access to a buried active site. In E. coli, it has been shown that movements of loop 5, with smaller movements in helix 5 and loop 4, act as substrate gate, facilitating inhibitor access to rhomboid catalytic residues. Herein we present a new structure of the Haemophilus influenzae rhomboid hiGlpG, which reveals disorder in loop 5, helix 5, and loop 4, indicating that, together, they represent mobile elements of the substrate gate. Substrate cleavage assays by hiGlpG with amino acid substitutions in these mobile regions demonstrate that the flexibilities of both loop 5 and helix 5 are important for access of the substrates to the catalytic residues. Mutagenesis indicates that less mobility by loop 4 is required for substrate cleavage. A reexamination of the reaction mechanism of rhomboid substrates, whereby cleavage of the scissile bond occurs on the si-face of the peptide bond, is discussed.
TI  - Evaluation of three swab transport systems for the maintenance of clinically important bacteria in simulated mono- and polymicrobial samples.
AB  - In this study, three swab transport systems were evaluated: M40 Transystem, Amies broth with a relatively new type of swab (both Copan Diagnostics, Corona, CA, USA), and SSI transportmedium (Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen Denmark). The CLSI M40-A standard procedures and 11 culture collection strains were used. The transport systems were tested at room temperature for holding times of 0, 24, and 48 h, and both mono- and polymicrobial samples were included. After 24 h of simulated transportation, all systems were able to maintain the viability of all organisms tested. SSI transportmedium exhibited the lowest maintaining ability, whereas the two Copan systems were the most growth-promoting system. In polymicrobial samples, this latter feature was a problem. At 48 h, no transport system could maintain the viability of all strains, and the recovery rates differed depending on organism and device. The species most difficult to recover in all the three systems was Neisseria gonorrhoeae. When selecting a swab transport system, consideration must be given to the sample type, the conditions that prevail locally, and the performance in the clinical setting.
TI  - Effectiveness of engineering the nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae antigen Omp26 as an S-layer fusion in bacterial ghosts as a mucosal vaccine delivery.
AB  - The potential of empty bacterial cell envelopes (ghosts) as a delivery system for mucosal immunization was assessed in a rat model and different routes of immunization were evaluated. Animals were mucosally immunized targeting either gut only or gut and lung mucosal sites with Escherichia coli ghosts harbouring the nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) antigen Omp26. Omp26 was expressed as either a part of an S-layer fusion or as a soluble protein in the periplasm. In the gut/lung regime two initial gut targeted inoculations with the ghosts were followed by an intratracheal (IT) boost with purified Omp26. The gut only immunization regime showed a moderate enhancement of bacterial clearance following pulmonary challenge whereas the gut/lung immunization regime resulted in significantly enhanced pulmonary clearance of NTHi. Both immunization regimes induced high levels of Omp26 specific antibodies in the serum of immunized rats, with higher levels in the groups that received the IT boost with purified Omp26. Analysis of IgG isotypes present in serum suggest that the immune response was predominantly of a T-helper1 type. Additionally, immunization induced a significant cellular immune response with lymphocytes from animals vaccinated using the gut/lung regime responding significantly to Omp26 when compared to control groups. The results of this study show that mucosal immunization with recombinant Omp26 in E. coli ghosts followed by a boost with purified Omp26 can induce a specific and protective immune response in a rodent model of acute lung infection.
TI  - Haem release from haemopexin by HxuA allows Haemophilus influenzae to escape host nutritional immunity.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae is an obligate human commensal/pathogen. This haem auxotroph must acquire haem from its host to sustain aerobic growth. Haem-haemopexin complexes are one of the potential sources of haem for this microorganism. Haemopexin is a glycoprotein that binds haem with high affinity (subpicomolar Kd) and involved in haem recycling. HxuA, a cell surface protein, is the key to haem acquisition from haemopexin. In this study, we reconstituted a functional Hxu system from H. influenzae in Escherichia coli K-12 that mediated active haem transport across the outer membrane from haem-haemopexin, in the presence of the inner membrane energy-transducing TonB-ExbB-ExbD complex from H. influenzae. A secreted variant of HxuA, HxuA(dm), was produced in E. coli. HxuA(dm) functionally complemented an hxuA mutant of H. influenzae for haem-haemopexin acquisition. HxuA(dm) interacted with haemopexin and haem-haemopexin, with which it formed high-affinity, stoichiometric complexes. Following the interaction between haem-haemopexin and HxuA(dm), haem was no longer bound to its initial high-affinity site and became accessible to its cognate haem receptor, HxuC. HxuA(dm) and the HxuA(dm)-haemopexin complex do not appear to bind haem at detectable levels (affinities below 10(6) M(-1)). HxuA thus appears to 'release' haem from haem-haemopexin complexes and to prevent haem sequestering by haemopexin.
TI  - Novel bacterial NAD+-dependent DNA ligase inhibitors with broad-spectrum activity and antibacterial efficacy in vivo.
AB  - DNA ligases are indispensable enzymes playing a critical role in DNA replication, recombination, and repair in all living organisms. Bacterial NAD+-dependent DNA ligase (LigA) was evaluated for its potential as a broad-spectrum antibacterial target. A novel class of substituted adenosine analogs was discovered by target-based high-throughput screening (HTS), and these compounds were optimized to render them more effective and selective inhibitors of LigA. The adenosine analogs inhibited the LigA activities of Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus, with inhibitory activities in the nanomolar range. They were selective for bacterial NAD+-dependent DNA ligases, showing no inhibitory activity against ATP-dependent human DNA ligase 1 or bacteriophage T4 ligase. Enzyme kinetic measurements demonstrated that the compounds bind competitively with NAD+. X-ray crystallography demonstrated that the adenosine analogs bind in the AMP-binding pocket of the LigA adenylation domain. Antibacterial activity was observed against pathogenic Gram-positive and atypical bacteria, such as S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and M. pneumoniae, as well as against Gram-negative pathogens, such as H. influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. The mode of action was verified using recombinant strains with altered LigA expression, an Okazaki fragment accumulation assay, and the isolation of resistant strains with ligA mutations. In vivo efficacy was demonstrated in a murine S. aureus thigh infection model and a murine S. pneumoniae lung infection model. Treatment with the adenosine analogs reduced the bacterial burden (expressed in CFU) in the corresponding infected organ tissue as much as 1,000-fold, thus validating LigA as a target for antibacterial therapy.
TI  - The expression of soluble and active recombinant Haemophilus influenzae IgA1 protease in E. coli.
AB  - Immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1) proteases from Haemophilus influenzae are extracellular  proteases that specifically cleave the hinge region of human IgA1, the predominant class of immunoglobulin present on mucosal membranes. The IgA1 proteases may have the potential to cleave IgA1 complexes in the kidney and be a therapeutic agent for IgA1 nephropathy (IgAN), a disease characterized by deposition of the IgA1 antibody in the glomerulus. We have screened for the expression of recombinant H. influenzae IgA1 protease by combining various expression plasmids, IgA1 protease constructs, and E. coli strains under multiple conditions. Using the method we have developed, approximately 20-40 mg/L of soluble and active H. influenzae IgA1 protease can be produced from E. coli strain C41(DE3), a significant increase in yield compared to the yield upon expression in H. influenzae or other related bacteria.
TI  - Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in resource-constrained settings - experience from five pilot projects.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The rapid increase in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among bacteria is a major public health concern. The WHO Global Strategy for Containment of Antimicrobial Resistance proposed that model systems be developed for AMR surveillance and for monitoring antimicrobial use. METHODS: Pilot projects were established in three sites in India and two in South Africa to collect monthly AMR data on target bacteria for at least 12 months. Escherichia coli was used as the target bacterium in four sites (three in India, one in South Africa). One South African site used Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Each site sought to obtain at least 960 isolates per year. Resistance was determined by disc diffusion or minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) methods. RESULTS: Data were collected for 12 and 16 months respectively in the South African sites and for 14 months in one Indian site and 24 months in the other two. All sites found difficulty collecting the required number of isolates, with three sites failing to do so. Escherichia coli isolates were more easily obtained and two sites developed methods to increase their yield. Disc diffusion testing provided more timely and reliable AMR data than did MIC determinations. Although methodological issues limit the comparability of data, high AMR rates were observed at all five sites. CONCLUSION: All five pilot sites provided data on AMR, but also raised several issues related to logistics of long-term surveillance in settings under resource constraints. For surveillance of AMR in such settings, E. coli is probably the best indicator bacterium.
TI  - Investigation of oral opportunistic pathogens in independent living elderly Japanese.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pneumonia is reported to be associated with high morbidity in elderly  and compromised individuals, with poor oral health demonstrated to be a significant risk factor for pneumonia. Several opportunistic pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, have been detected in patients with pneumonia. We investigated the prevalence of opportunistic pathogens in the oral cavity of healthy independent living Japanese elderly subjects and analysed factors related to harbouring those pathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 265 subjects, each of whom received a dental examination, during which specimens were collected with a tongue swab and examined for the presence of 10 oral opportunistic pathogens using single or multiple selective media. Furthermore, the presence of occult blood in saliva was examined using test paper strips. RESULTS: Oral opportunistic pathogens were detected in 13.6% of the subjects. Those positive for occult blood in saliva had a significantly higher rate of harbouring the pathogens (p < 0.05). In addition, age was a significant factor for the presence of pathogenic microbes in the oral cavity (p = 0.033). CONCLUSION: Positive findings of occult blood in saliva and older age are suggested to be significant factors for harbouring opportunistic pathogens in the oral cavity.
TI  - [Etiology and epidemic characteristics of hospital acquired pneumonia in children].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the etiology and epidemic characteristics of hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP) in children. METHOD: A retrospective hospital infection study was performed in 52,639 children admitted to our hospital from January 2005 to December 2008. RESULT: Six hundred and ninety eight patients were diagnosed as HAP. The incidence of HAP was 1.33%, among which, 108 (15.47%) cases were early-onset HAP and 590 (84.53%) were late-onset HAP. The HAP patients aged 3 days to 15 years (503 male and 195 female). The proportion of patients younger than 1 year was 51.4%. Main underlying diseases were cytomegalovirus hepatitis, congenital heart disease, malignant tumor, granulocytopenia or agranulocytosis, prematurity and low birth weight. There was significant difference in the incidences among different departments with the highest one seen in ICU, followed by departments of infectious diseases, hematology and digestive diseases. Two hundred and thirty one stains of pathogens were identified from sputum of 355 cases. One hundred and fifty six (67.5%) strains were Gram-negative bacteria, which accounted for the highest proportion. There were 30 (13.0%) Gram-positive bacterial strains, and 29 (12.6%) respiratory tract virus strains, and 15 (6.5%) fungal strains, and 1 (0.4%) mycoplasma strain. The predominant bacterial pathogens were Klebsiella pneumoniae, followed by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Burkholderia cepacia, Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii. The isolation rates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli with positive extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were 94.8% and 85.7%, respectively. Those two bacteria were universally resistant to the third and forth generations cephalosporins. The main pathogens of early-onset HAP were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae and Klebsiella pneumoniae, while the main pathogens of late-onset HAP were ESBLs-positive Klebsiella pneumonia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Burkholderia cepacia, Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii. CONCLUSION: HAP in children is most common in children younger than 1 year and with underlying diseases. The main pathogens are Gram-negative bacteria. RSV was an important pathogen of HAP. The pathogens of early-onset HAP are different from those of late-onset HAP. These results may be of some help in prevention and control of HAP in children and in guiding for rational application of antibiotics, especially the empirical antibiotic choice.
TI  - Infections of people with complement deficiencies and patients who have undergone splenectomy.
AB  - The complement system comprises several fluid-phase and membrane-associated proteins. Under physiological conditions, activation of the fluid-phase components of complement is maintained under tight control and complement activation occurs primarily on surfaces recognized as "nonself" in an attempt to minimize damage to bystander host cells. Membrane complement components act to limit complement activation on host cells or to facilitate uptake of antigens or microbes "tagged" with complement fragments. While this review focuses on the role of complement in infectious diseases, work over the past couple of decades has defined several important functions of complement distinct from that of combating infections. Activation of complement in the fluid phase can occur through the classical, lectin, or alternative pathway. Deficiencies of components of the classical pathway lead to the development of autoimmune disorders and predispose individuals to recurrent respiratory infections and infections caused by encapsulated organisms, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae. While no individual with complete mannan-binding lectin (MBL) deficiency has been identified, low MBL levels have been linked to predisposition to, or severity of, several diseases. It appears that MBL may play an important role in children, who have a relatively immature adaptive immune response. C3 is the point at which all complement pathways converge, and complete deficiency of C3 invariably leads to severe infections, including those caused by meningococci and pneumococci. Deficiencies of the alternative and terminal complement pathways result in an almost exclusive predisposition to invasive meningococcal disease. The spleen plays an important role in antigen processing and the production of antibodies. Splenic macrophages are critical in clearing opsonized encapsulated bacteria (such as pneumococci, meningococci, and Escherichia coli) and intraerythrocytic parasites such as those causing malaria and babesiosis, which explains the fulminant nature of these infections in persons with anatomic or functional asplenia. Paramount to the management of patients with complement deficiencies and asplenia is educating patients about their predisposition to infection and the importance of preventive immunizations and seeking prompt medical attention.
TI  - Construction of a novel shuttle vector for use in Haemophilus influenzae and H. parainfluenzae.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae is an important human pathogen. A number of complete genome sequences of various haemophili are available; however, functional studies have been limited by the lack of an effective shuttle vector which functions in all strains. Here, we have constructed a shuttle vector, pEJ6, which transfers genes between Escherichia coli and H. influenzae and H. parainfluenzae. The vector contains an origin of replication from pLS88 which is functional in E. coli and H. influenzae. In addition it contains an RP4 mobilisation region. The vector can be introduced by electroporation and conjugation into capsulate and non-typeable H. influenzae and is functional for allelic replacement and mutant complementation. The vector will be useful for investigating gene function in Haemophilus spp.
TI  - Unraveling the hydroxypropionaldehyde (HPA) system: an active antimicrobial agent against human pathogens.
AB  - The hydroxypropionaldehyde (HPA) system is a natural defense system synthesized by the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus reuteri. To elucidate which of the molecules composing the HPA system (3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA), reuterin (HPA dimer), and HPA hydrate) is responsible for the potent antimicrobial activity in biological systems, a combination of biochemical, genetic, and proteomic assays was used. The HPA system reacts with sulfhydryl-containing compounds such as cysteine and reduced glutathione (GSH) in solution. In situ, GSH knock-out Escherichia coli is significantly more susceptible to HPA-mediated cell death than E. coli wild type; GSH supplementation protects either bacteria from HPA attack. Proteomic analysis of HPA-treated bacteria ( Haemophilus influenzae ) revealed induction of redox- and heat shock-related proteins. A new antimicrobial mechanism of HPA is proposed, whereby the activity of HPA leads to depletion of free SH- groups in GSH and proteins through the action of 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde, causing an imbalance of the cellular redox status, ultimately resulting in cell death.
TI  - [Acquired bacterial meningitis in Monastir region, Tunisia (1999-2006): bacteriological aspects and susceptibility patterns].
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the distribution of bacteria responsible for purulent meningitis and the pattern of resistance of common species in the University Hospital of Monastir (Tunisia). All bacteriologically confirmed cases of bacterial meningitis were recorded between 1999 and 2006, and have been analyzed by classic bacterial methods advocate for meningitis. Two hundred fifty three strains have been isolated. The most frequent species were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, followed by Escherichia coli and Neisseria meningitides with 19.4, 13.8, 13.8, 7.1, and 6.3% of cases, respectively. Their distribution with regard to age was in accordance with literature data. The yearly distribution of these bacteria did not show any epidemic peak. Enterobacteriaceae and group B Streptococcus were the most frequently identified pathogens in neonatal meningitis. H. Influenzae was the predominant microorganism in children between three month and five years of age (36.3%), followed by S. Pneumoniae (28.8%). S. Pneumoniae was the predominant bacteria responsible for 47% of the cases over five years of age. 38.8% of S. Pneumoniae strains were less susceptible to penicillin. Resistance rates for amoxicillin and cefotaxime were 4.1%, respectively. Only one strain of N. meningitidis (6.2%) presented a decreased susceptibility to penicillin. 22.9% of H. Influenzae strains produced beta-lactamase. The resistance rates of Enterobacteriaceae to third generation cephalosporins were 25%. In our study, nosocomial meningitis have shown a rate of 24.4%. The most affected service was neurosurgery, pediatrics, and intensive care units. The increasing prevalence of pneumococci meningitis with reduced sensitivity to penicillin G strains isolated from meningitis makes adequate therapeutic management difficult.
TI  - The herbicide ketoclomazone inhibits 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase in the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate pathway and shows antibacterial activity against Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Two distinct metabolic pathways have been elucidated for the formation of isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate, essential metabolic precursors for isoprenoid biosynthesis: the mevalonate pathway, found ubiquitously in mammals, and the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, found in most bacteria. As the MEP pathway is absent from mammals, all MEP pathway enzymes represent effective targets for the development of antibacterial drugs. In this study, we found that a herbicide, ketoclomazone, exhibited antibacterial activity against a pathogenic bacterium, Haemophilus influenzae, with an MIC value of 12.5 mug ml(-1) and that antibacterial activity was suppressed by adding 1-deoxyxylulose, a free alcohol of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP). DXP is an MEP pathway intermediate synthesized from pyruvate and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (D-GAP) by the action of DXP synthase. Thus, we investigated the enzyme kinetics of DXP synthase of H. influenzae (HiDXS) to elucidate an inhibitory mechanism of ketoclomazone on HiDXS. The dxs gene was cloned from H. influenzae and overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the enzyme was purified to homogeneity. The purified HiDXS was a soluble dimeric 70-kDa protein. Steady-state kinetic constants for HiDXS were calculated, and Lineweaver-Burk plots were consistent with a ping-pong bi bi mechanism. The kinetics of inhibition by ketoclomazone suggested that ketoclomazone binds to an unidentified inhibitor-binding site that differs from both the pyruvate-binding site and the D-GAP-binding site on DXP synthase. These data reveal the inhibitory mechanism of ketoclomazone on DXP synthase.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in Canadian hospitals: results of the Canadian Ward Surveillance Study (CANWARD 2008).
AB  - A total of 5,282 bacterial isolates obtained between 1 January and 31 December 31 2008, inclusive, from patients in 10 hospitals across Canada as part of the Canadian Ward Surveillance Study (CANWARD 2008) underwent susceptibility testing. The 10 most common organisms, representing 78.8% of all clinical specimens, were as follows: Escherichia coli (21.4%), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; 13.9%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (10.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.0%), coagulase-negative staphylococci/Staphylococcus epidermidis (5.4%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; 5.1%), Haemophilus influenzae (4.1%), Enterococcus spp. (3.3%), Enterobacter cloacae (2.2%). MRSA comprised 27.0% (272/1,007) of all S. aureus isolates (genotypically, 68.8% of MRSA were health care associated [HA-MRSA] and 27.6% were community associated [CA-MRSA]). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli occurred in 4.9% of E. coli isolates. The CTX-M type was the predominant ESBL, with CTX-M-15 the most prevalent genotype. MRSA demonstrated no resistance to ceftobiprole, daptomycin, linezolid, telavancin, tigecycline, or vancomycin (0.4% intermediate intermediate resistance). E. coli demonstrated no resistance to ertapenem, meropenem, or tigecycline. Resistance rates with P. aeruginosa were as follows: colistin (polymyxin E), 0.8%; amikacin, 3.5%; cefepime, 7.2%; gentamicin, 12.3%; fluoroquinolones, 19.0 to 24.1%; meropenem, 5.6%; piperacillin-tazobactam, 8.0%. A multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype occurred frequently in P. aeruginosa (5.9%) but uncommonly in E. coli (1.2%) and K. pneumoniae (0.9%). In conclusion, E. coli, S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA), P. aeruginosa, S. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and Enterococcus spp. are the most common isolates recovered from clinical specimens in Canadian hospitals. The prevalence of MRSA was 27.0% (of which genotypically 27.6% were CA-MRSA), while ESBL-producing E. coli occurred in 4.9% of isolates. An MDR phenotype was common in P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Adhesion, invasion, and agglutination mediated by two trimeric autotransporters in the human uropathogen Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Fimbriae of the human uropathogen Proteus mirabilis are the only characterized surface proteins that contribute to its virulence by mediating adhesion and invasion of the uroepithelia. PMI2122 (AipA) and PMI2575 (TaaP) are annotated in the genome of strain HI4320 as trimeric autotransporters with "adhesin-like" and "agglutinating adhesin-like" properties, respectively. The C-terminal 62 amino acids (aa) in AipA and 76 aa in TaaP are homologous to the translocator domains of YadA from Yersinia enterocolitica and Hia from Haemophilus influenzae. Comparative protein modeling using the Hia three-dimensional structure as a template predicted that each of these domains would contain four antiparallel beta sheets and that they formed homotrimers. Recombinant AipA and TaaP were seen as approximately 28 kDa and approximately 78 kDa, respectively, in Escherichia coli, and each also formed high-molecular-weight homotrimers, thus supporting this model. E. coli synthesizing AipA or TaaP bound to extracellular matrix proteins with a 10- to 60-fold-higher level of affinity than the control strain. Inactivation of aipA in P. mirabilis strains significantly (P < 0.01) reduced the mutants' ability to adhere to or invade HEK293 cell monolayers, and the functions were restored upon complementation. A 51-aa-long invasin region in the AipA passenger domain was required for this function. E. coli expressing TaaP mediated autoagglutination, and a taaP mutant of P. mirabilis showed significantly (P < 0.05) more reduced aggregation than HI4320. Gly-247 in AipA and Gly-708 in TaaP were indispensable for trimerization and activity. AipA and TaaP individually offered advantages to P. mirabilis in a murine model. This is the first report characterizing trimeric autotransporters in P. mirabilis as afimbrial surface adhesins and autoagglutinins.
TI  - The role of vicinal tyrosine residues in the function of Haemophilus influenzae ferric-binding protein A.
AB  - The periplasmic FbpA (ferric-binding protein A) from Haemophilus influenzae plays a critical role in acquiring iron from host transferrin, shuttling iron from the outer-membrane receptor complex to the inner-membrane transport complex responsible for transporting iron into the cytoplasm. In the present study, we report on the properties of a series of site-directed mutants of two adjacent tyrosine residues involved in iron co-ordination, and demonstrate that, in contrast with mutation of equivalent residues in the N-lobe of human transferrin, the mutant FbpAs retain significant iron-binding affinity regardless of the nature of the replacement amino acid. The Y195A and Y196A FbpAs are not only capable of binding iron, but are proficient in mediating periplasm-to-cytoplasm iron transport in a reconstituted FbpABC pathway in a specialized Escherichia coli reporter strain. This indicates that their inability to mediate iron acquisition from transferrin is due to their inability to compete for iron with receptor-bound transferrin. Wild-type iron-loaded FbpA could be crystalized in a closed or open state depending upon the crystallization conditions. The synergistic phosphate anion was not present in the iron-loaded open form, suggesting that initial anchoring of iron was mediated by the adjacent tyrosine residues and that alternate pathways for iron and anion binding and release may be considered. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the presence of a twin-tyrosine motif common to many periplasmic iron-binding proteins is critical for initially capturing the ferric ion released by the outer-membrane receptor complex.
TI  - Neonatal community-acquired pneumonia: pathogens and treatment.
AB  - AIM: To analyse the bacterial pathogens and drug sensitivities for neonatal community-acquired pneumonia. METHODS: Seven hundred sixty sputum samples from newborns with community-acquired pneumonia were cultured to determine microbial organisms present and their drug sensitivities. RESULTS: Of the 760 specimens, 425 grew pathogens for a 55.9% positive rate. Among the 425 positive cultures, 278 grew gram-negative organisms (65.4%), 142 grew gram-positive organisms (33.3%), while 5 grew fungus (1.3%). The most common gram-negative organisms were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Hemophilus influenzae, while the most common gram-positive organisms were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. To the gram-negative organisms, the most sensitive drugs were meropenem, imipenem and amikacin, while to the gram-positive ones were vancomycin, teicoplanin and quinupristin/dalfopristin. CONCLUSIONS: The most common causative bacteria were gram-negative organisms, which were highly sensitive to Meropenem, Imipenem and Amikacin, yet often treatable with more focused antibiotic coverage, which depended on the bacterium identified.
TI  - Discovery and analysis of 4H-pyridopyrimidines, a class of selective bacterial protein synthesis inhibitors.
AB  - Bacterial protein synthesis is the target for numerous natural and synthetic antibacterial agents. We have developed a poly(U) mRNA-directed aminoacylation/translation protein synthesis system composed of phenyl-tRNA synthetases, ribosomes, and ribosomal factors from Escherichia coli. This system, utilizing purified components, has been used for high-throughput screening of a small-molecule chemical library. We have identified a series of compounds that inhibit protein synthesis with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) ranging from 3 to 14 muM. This series of compounds all contained the same central scaffold composed of tetrahydropyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidin-4-ol (e.g., 4H-pyridopyrimidine). All analogs contained an ortho pyridine ring attached to the central scaffold in the 2 position and either a five- or a six-member ring tethered to the 6-methylene nitrogen atom of the central scaffold. These compounds inhibited the growth of E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, with MICs ranging from 0.25 to 32 mug/ml. Macromolecular synthesis (MMS) assays with E. coli and S. aureus confirmed that antibacterial activity resulted from specific inhibition of protein synthesis. Assays were developed for the steps performed by each component of the system in order to ascertain the target of the compounds, and the ribosome was found to be the site of inhibition.
TI  - Use of quantitative broad-based polymerase chain reaction for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conventional laboratory diagnosis of bacterial meningitis based on microscopy followed by culture is time-consuming and has only moderate sensitivity. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to define the limit of detection (LOD), analytic specificity, and performance characteristics of a broad-based quantitative multiprobe polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for rapid bacterial detection and simultaneous pathogen-specific identification in patients with suspected meningitis. METHODS: A PCR algorithm consisting of initial broad-based detection of Eubacteriales by a universal probe, followed by pathogen identification using either pathogen-specific probes or Gram-typing probes, was employed to detect pathogens. The 16S rRNA gene, which contains both conserved and variable regions, was chosen as the target. Pathogen-specific probes were designed for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes. Gram-positive and -negative typing probes were designed based on conserved regions across all eubacteria. The LOD and time to detection were assessed by dilutional mocked-up samples. A total of 108 convenience cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) clinical samples obtained from the Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) microbiology laboratory were tested, and results were compared with hospital microbiologic culture reports. RESULTS: The LOD of the assay ranged from 10(1) to 10(2) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. Pathogen-specific probes showed no cross-reactivity with other organisms. Time to detection was 3 hours. In clinical specimens, the universal probe correctly detected 16 of 22 culture-positive clinical specimens (sensitivity = 72.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 49.8% to 89.3%), which were all correctly characterized by either pathogen-specific or Gram-typing probes. Adjusted sensitivity after removing probable microbiologic laboratory contaminants was 88.9% (95% CI = 65.3% to 98.6%). The universal probe was negative for 86 of 86 culture-negative specimens. CONCLUSIONS: A broad-based multiprobe PCR assay demonstrated strong analytic performance characteristics. Findings from a pilot clinical study showed promise in translation to human subjects, supporting potential utility of the assay as an adjunct to traditional diagnostics for early identification of bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Microbial etiologies of hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia.
AB  - Hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP) and ventilator-associated bacterial  pneumonia (VABP) can be caused by a wide variety of bacteria that originate from the patient flora or the health care environment. We review the medical and microbiology literature and the results of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (1997-2008) to establish the pathogens most likely to cause HABP or VABP. In all studies, a consistent 6 organisms (Staphylococcus aureus [28.0%], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [21.8%], Klebsiella species [9.8%], Escherichia coli [6.9%], Acinetobacter species [6.8%], and Enterobacter species [6.3%]) caused approximately 80% of episodes, with lower prevalences of Serratia species, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and community-acquired pathogens, such as pneumococci and Haemophilus influenzae. Slight changes in the pathogen order were noted among geographic regions; Latin America had an increased incidence of nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. In addition, VABP isolates of the same species had a mean of 5%-10% less susceptibility to frequently used extended-spectrum antimicrobials, and the rate of drug resistance among HABP and VABP pathogens has been increasing by 1% per year (2004-2008). In conclusion, the empirical treatment of HABP and VABP due to prevailing bacterial causes and emerging drug resistance has become more challenging and requires use of multidrug empirical treatment regimens for routine clinical practice. These facts have profound impact on the choices of comparison therapies to be applied in contemporary new drug clinical trials for pneumonia.
TI  - Antimicrobial drug resistance trends of bacteremia isolates in a rural hospital in southern Mozambique.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance in Africa is increasing but insufficiently recognized as a  public health problem. However, there are scarce data for antimicrobial resistance trends among bloodstream isolates in sub-Saharan Africa. Antimicrobial drug resistance trends among bacteria isolated from blood of children < 15 years of age admitted to the Manhica District Hospital in Mozambique during May 2001-April 2006 were monitored by disk diffusion. We documented a linear trend of increasing resistance throughout the study period to chloramphenicol among isolates of Non-typhi Salmonella (P < 0.001), Escherichia coli (P = 0.002), Staphylococcus aureus (P < 0.001), and Haemophilus influenzae (P < 0.001). Increasing resistance to ampicillin was also observed for H. influenzae isolates (P < 0.001). We report trends of increasing resistance among the most frequent etiologies of bacteremia to the most commonly used antibiotics for empirical therapy in this community. Quinolones and third-generation cephalosporines may be needed in the short term to manage community-acquired infections.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of respiratory pathogens recently isolated in Italy: focus on cefditoren.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro antibiotic susceptibility of respiratory pathogens recently isolated in Italy to commonly used antibiotics including cefditoren. Six clinical microbiological laboratories collected, between January and September 2009, a total of 2,510 respiratory pathogens from subjects with community-acquired respiratory tract infections (CARTI). Ceftditoren, out of all the beta-lactams studied, had the lowest MIC(90 )against 965 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae examined, followed by cefotaxime and ceftriaxone (2% resistance in penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP)). Against 470 Haemophilus influenzae , independently of their production of beta-lactamases or ampicillin resistance, cefditoren was the oral cephalosporin with the best in vitro activity, comparable to that of the injectable cephalosporins and levofloxacin. Higher MIC(90)s were found for the macrolides (4 - 16 mg/l) and cefaclor (4 - 32 mg/l). As was foreseeable, Streptococcus pyogenes (225 strains) was uniformly sensitive to all the beta-lactam antibiotics, but the elevated MIC(90 )values reduced (<75%) susceptibility of this pathogen to macrolides. Beta-lactamase-negative Moraxella catarrhalis (100 strains) had reduced susceptibility only to the macrolides, while the 250 beta-lactamase-producing strains also had reduced susceptibility to cefuroxime. Levofloxacin showed the lowest MIC(50)/MIC(90 )values in the producing strains, whereas cefditoren, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone in the non-producers. As regards the enterobacteriaceae, cefditoren and levofloxacin had the lowest MIC(90)s against Klebsiella pneumoniae. Cefditoren and the third-generation injectable cephalosporins had the lowest MIC(90)s against Escherichia coli (100% susceptibility) while levofloxacin was less active (86% susceptibility).In conclusion, cefditoren's wide spectrum and high intrinsic activity, as well as its capacity to overcome most of the resistance that has become consolidated in some classes of antibiotics widely used as empiric therapy for CARTI, allows us to suggest that cefditoren might be included in the european guidelines as one of the first-choice antibiotics in the treatment of CARTI.
TI  - Differential pulse voltammetric determination and catalytic oxidation of sulfamethoxazole using [5,10,15,20- tetrakis (3-methoxy-4-hydroxy phenyl) porphyrinato] Cu (II) modified carbon paste sensor.
AB  - Sulfamethoxazole (SM) is a sulfonamide bacteriostatic antibiotic. Its primary activity is against susceptible forms of streptococcus, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, and oral anaerobes. It is commonly used to treat urinary tract infections. In addition it can be used as an alternative to amoxicillin-based antibiotics to treat sinusitis. It can also be used to treat toxoplasmosis. In the present work, a metalloporphyrin modified carbon paste sensor was fabricated and the electrochemical behaviour of SM was studied using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Cu (II) complex of 5,10,15,20- tetrakis (3-methoxy-4-hydroxy phenyl) porphyrin (TMHPP Cu (II)) was used as the active material. Compared with bare carbon paste electrode (CPE), the TMHPP Cu (II) modified CPE exhibits excellent enhancement effect on the electrochemical oxidation of SM. A well-defined oxidation peak of SM occurs at -140 mV in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) of pH 6. All the experimental parameters were optimized and it was found that under optimum conditions the oxidation peak current was linear to the concentration of SM in the range of 1.0 x 10(-2)-1.0 x 10(-8) M with a detection limit of 1.5 x 10(-9) M. The developed sensor has been successfully applied for the determination of SM in pharmaceutical formulations and urine sample.
TI  - Standardized comparison of antiseptic efficacy of triclosan, PVP-iodine, octenidine dihydrochloride, polyhexanide and chlorhexidine digluconate.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study presents a comparative investigation of the antimicrobial  efficacy of the antiseptics PVP-iodine, triclosan, chlorhexidine, octenidine and polyhexanide used for pre-surgical antisepsis and antiseptic treatment of skin, wounds and mucous membranes based on internationally accepted standards. METHODS: MICs and MBCs were determined in accordance with DIN 58940-7 and 58940-8 using Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), Enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium perfringens, Haemophilus influenzae and Candida albicans. The microbicidal efficacy was determined in accordance with DIN EN 1040 and 1275 using S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans. RESULTS: For chlorhexidine, octenidine and polyhexanide, MIC(48) and MBC(24) ranged from 16 to 32 mg/L. Maximum values for triclosan ranged from 256 to 512 mg/L, with an efficacy gap against P. aeruginosa, while the maximum values of PVP-iodine were 1024 mg/L, with a gap against S. pneumoniae. Comparing the minimal effective concentrations, octenidine was most effective. After 1 min, only octenidine and PVP-iodine fulfil the requirements for antiseptics. CONCLUSIONS: Tests under standardized and harmonized conditions help to choose the most efficacious agent. When a prolonged contact time is feasible, ranking of agents would be polyhexanide = octenidine > chlorhexidine > triclosan > PVP-iodine. This is consistent with the recommendations for antisepsis of acute wounds. Polyhexanide seems to be preferable for chronic wounds due to its higher tolerability. If an immediate effect is required, ranking would be octenidine = PVP-iodine>> polyhexanide > chlorhexidine > triclosan.
TI  - Microbiological profile of bacterial conjunctivitis in ibadan, Nigeria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In bacterial conjunctivitis, clinical presentations are not diagnostic of the causative agent, therefore, microbiological analysis is mandatory for specific treatment option. This study was undertaken to determine the microbiology profile of bacterial conjunctivitis in our environment. METHODOLOGY: This is a laboratory-based study carried out in the Medical Microbiology Laboratory of University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria. Conjunctival swabs collected from 365 patients with clinically diagnosed conjunctivitis, were analysed by standard bacteriological methods. RESULTS: Bacterial pathogens were detected in 342 (93.7%) conjunctival samples while 23(6.3%) were sterile. Of the pathogens, 256 (74.9%) were Staphylococcus aureus, 35(10.2%) Coagulase- negative staphylococci, 22 (6.4%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa , 11(3.2%) Escherichia coli, 7(2.1%) Klebsiella species, 5(1.5%) Streptococcus pneumoniae , 4(1.2%) Haemophilus influenzae, 1(0.3%) Proteus mirabilis, and 1(0.3%)Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The highest rate of conjunctivitis 96(26.3%) was found among infants and children (0-10years).Resistance rates to most of the tested antibiotics were high. However, 67% of them were susceptible to ceftriaxone while only 39.2% were susceptible to chloramphenicol. CONCLUSION: This study has recorded high antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens of conjunctivitis in this environment; therefore, determining the susceptibility pattern of these pathogens to available antibiotics is crucial to effective management of bacterial conjunctivitis.
TI  - [Expression and biological activity identification of recombinant Hap protein of  NTHi].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To express and purify Hap protein of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) in prokaryotic system, and study its immunogenicity and adhesive activity. METHOD: Hap protein was expressed in E.coli BL21 with pET32a (+)-Hap and purified by affinity chromatography. The adhesive activity of the recombinant Hap protein was observed in competitive adhesion assay using scanning electron microscope and bacterial counting. BALB/C mice were immunized intranasally with the purified recombinant Hap protein and cholera toxin B subunit (CT-B), and anti-Hap IgA and IgG were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: SDS-PAGE analysis showed a single band of the target protein, whose purity reached 85% according to the result of Gel analysis software. The concentration of the protein was 3.2 g/L after ultrafiltration and condensation. Competitive adhesion assay showed that compared with control group, the recombinant Hap protein significantly inhibited the adhesion of NTHi to ECM (P<0.01). Compared with Hap immunization alone, immunization with Hap combined with CT-B resulted in significantly higher titers of anti-Hap IgG and IgA in mice (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Highly purified recombinant Hap protein has been obtained in a prokaryotic system and shows good immunogenic and adhesive activities. These results will establish the basis for further study of NTHi vaccine.
TI  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia in a tertiary care hospital in India: role of multi-drug resistant pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP) is the most frequent intensive-care-unit (ICU)-acquired infection. The aetiology of VAP varies with different patient populations and types of ICUs. METHODOLOGY: A prospective study was performed over a period of 15 months in a tertiary care hospital to determine the various aetiological agents causing VAP and the prevalence of multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens. Combination disk method, Modified Hodge test, EDTA disk synergy (EDS) test and AmpC disk test were performed for the detection of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL), carbapenemases, metallo-beta-lactamases (MBL) and AmpC beta-lactamases respectively. RESULTS: Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Candida spp. were more common in early-onset VAP, while non-fermenters (Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp.) were significantly associated with late-onset VAP (P value 0.0267, Chi-square value 4.91). Thirty-seven (78.7%) of the 47 VAP pathogens were multidrug resistant. ESBL was produced by 50% and 67% of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae respectively. MBL was produced by 20% of P. aeruginosa. AmpC beta-lactamases were produced by 33.3% and 60.7% of the Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenters respectively. Of the S. aureus isolates, 43% were methicillin resistant. Prior antibiotic therapy and hospitalization of five days or more were independent risk factors for VAP by MDR pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: VAP is increasingly associated with MDR pathogens. Production of ESBL, AmpC beta-lactamases and metallo beta-lactamases were responsible for the multi-drug resistance of these pathogens. Increasing prevalence of MDR pathogens in patients with late-onset VAP indicate that appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotics should be used to treat them.
TI  - Interchangeable domains in the Kdo transferases of Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Kdo(2)-lipid A, a conserved substructure of lipopolysaccharide, plays critical roles in Gram-negative bacterial survival and interaction with host organisms. Inhibition of Kdo biosynthesis in Escherichia coli results in cell death and accumulation of the tetra-acylated precursor lipid IV(A). E. coli KdtA (EcKdtA) is a bifunctional enzyme that transfers two Kdo units from two CMP-Kdo molecules to lipid IV(A). In contrast, Haemophilus influenzae KdtA (HiKdtA) transfers only one Kdo unit. E. coli CMR300, which lacks Kdo transferase because of a deletion in kdtA, can be rescued to grow in broth at 37 degrees C if multiple copies of msbA are provided in trans. MsbA, the inner membrane transporter for nascent lipopolysaccharide, prefers hexa-acylated to tetra-acylated lipid A, but with the excess MsbA present in CMR300, lipid IV(A) is efficiently exported to the outer membrane. CMR300 is hypersensitive to hydrophobic antibiotics and bile salts and does not grow at 42 degrees C. Expressing HiKdtA in CMR300 results in the accumulation of Kdo-lipid IV(A) in place of lipid IV(A) without suppression of its growth phenotypes at 30 degrees C. EcKdtA restores intact lipopolysaccharide, together with normal antibiotic resistance, detergent resistance, and growth at 42 degrees C. To determine which residues are important for the mono- or bifunctional character of KdtA, protein chimeras were constructed using EcKdtA and HiKdtA. These chimeras, which are catalytically active, were characterized by in vitro assays and in vivo complementation. The N-terminal half of KdtA, especially the first 30 amino acid residues, specifies whether one or two Kdo units are transferred to lipid IV(A).
TI  - Experimental detection of knotted conformations in denatured proteins.
AB  - Structures that contain a knot formed by the path of the polypeptide backbone represent some of the most complex topologies observed in proteins. How or why these topological knots arise remains unclear. By developing a method to experimentally trap and detect knots in nonnative polypeptide chains, we find that two knotted methyltransferases, YibK and YbeA, can exist in a trefoil-knot conformation even in their chemically unfolded states. The unique denatured-state topology of these molecules explains their ability to efficiently fold to their native knotted structures in vitro and offers insights into the potential role of knots in proteins. Furthermore, the high prevalence of the denatured-state knots identified here suggests that they are either difficult to untie or that threading of any untied molecules is rapid and spontaneous. The occurrence of such knotted topologies in unfolded polypeptide chains raises the possibility that they could play an important, and as yet unexplored, role in folding and misfolding processes in vivo.
TI  - Utilizing the O-antigen lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathway in Escherichia coli to interrogate the substrate specificities of exogenous glycosyltransferase genes in a combinatorial approach.
AB  - In previous work, our laboratory generated novel chimeric lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in Escherichia coli transformed with a plasmid containing exogenous lipooligosaccharide synthesis genes (lsg) from Haemophilus influenzae. Analysis of these novel oligosaccharide-LPS chimeras allowed characterization of the carbohydrate structures generated by several putative glycosyltransferase genes within the lsg locus. Here, we adapted this strategy to construct a modular approach to study the synthetic properties of individual glycosyltransferases expressed alone and in combinations. To this end, a set of expression vectors containing one to four putative glycosyltransferase genes from the lsg locus, lsgC-F, were transformed into E. coli K12 (XL-1) which is defective in LPS O-antigen biosynthesis. This strategy relied on the inclusion of the H. influenzae gene product lsgG in every plasmid construct, which partially rescues the E. coli LPS biosynthesis defect by priming uridine diphosphate-undecaprenyl in the WecA-dependent O-antigen synthetic pathway with N-acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc). This GlcNAc-undecaprenyl then served as an acceptor substrate for further carbohydrate extension by transformed glycosyltransferases. The resultant LPS-linked chimeric glycans were isolated from their E. coli constructs and characterized by mass spectrometry, methylation analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. These structural data allowed the specificity of various glycosyltransferases to be unambiguously assigned to individual genes. LsgF was found to transfer a galactose (Gal) to terminal GlcNAc. LsgE was found to transfer GlcNAc to Gal-GlcNAc, and both LsgF and LsgD were found to transfer Gal to GlcNAc-Gal-GlcNAc but with differing linkage specificities. This method can be generalized and readily adapted to study the substrate specificity of other putative or uncharacterized glycosyltransferases.
TI  - Eleven-year study of causes of neonatal bacterial meningitis in Ahvaz, Iran.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial meningitis is a devastating infection with a high mortality rate, especially in neonates. The aim of this study was to determine the causative agents that cause bacterial meningitis in Khuzestan province in the south-western region of Iran. METHODS: A descriptive, cross-sectional study was carried out from 1997 to 2007 at the neonatal ward of a university teaching hospital (Emam Khomeini hospital) in Ahvaz. All infants younger than 29 days old who suffered from meningitis were included. Laboratory tests included Gram stain, culture, and biochemical tests. Cases were defined as meningitis if the cerebrospinal fluid culture was positive. RESULTS: Based on cerebrospinal fluid culture, 31 infants were identified as having bacterial meningitis. Eleven (35.5%) of these cases were caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, nine (29%) were caused by Enterobacter spp., three (9.6%) were caused by Escherichia coli, three (9.6%) were caused by Enterococcus spp., two (6.4%) were caused by Acinetobacter, and one case each (3.2%) was caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae. The male-to-female ratio was 2 : 1 (67.7% were male). The birthweights of 20 (64.5%) patients were under 2500 g and 11 (35.4%) patients had normal birthweights. Thirteen (42%) were early-onset cases and 18 (58%) were late-onset cases. More than half of the cases (54.8%) acquired the infection from the hospital. Blood cultures were positive for 18 (58%) patients. Thirty-two percent of cases died in spite of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter spp. were the two main causative agents that caused neonatal bacterial meningitis, and nosocomial meningitis was the most common type in our ward.
TI  - A distinct mechanism for the ABC transporter BtuCD-BtuF revealed by the dynamics  of complex formation.
AB  - ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are integral membrane proteins that translocate a diverse array of substrates across cell membranes. We present here the dynamics of complex formation of three structurally characterized ABC transporters-the BtuCD vitamin B(12) importer and MetNI d/l-methionine importer from Escherichia coli and the Hi1470/1 metal-chelate importer from Haemophilus influenzae-in complex with their cognate binding proteins. Similarly to other ABC importers, MetNI interacts with its binding protein with low affinity (K(d) approximately 10(-4) M). In contrast, BtuCD-BtuF and Hi1470/1-Hi1472 form stable, high-affinity complexes (K(d) approximately 10(-13) and 10(-9) M, respectively). In BtuCD-BtuF, vitamin B(12) accelerates the complex dissociation rate approximately 10(7)-fold, with ATP having an additional destabilizing effect. The findings presented here highlight substantial mechanistic differences between BtuCD-BtuF, and likely Hi1470/1-Hi1472, and the better-characterized maltose and related ABC transport systems, indicating that there is considerable mechanistic diversity within this large protein super-family.
TI  - [Childhood bacterial meningitis trends in Japan from 2007 to 2008].
AB  - We surveyed pediatrics bacterial meningitis epidemiology from January 2007 to December 2008 in Japan, with the following results: Cases numbered 287-160 male and 127 female-equivalent to 1.54-1.62 of 1,000 pediatric hospitalization per year. Children under 1-year-old accounted for the highest number of cases, which decreased with increasing age. Haemophilus influenzae was the most common cause of infection, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae, group B streptococcus (GBS), and Escherichia coli. GBS and E. coli were major pathogens in children under 4 months of age, while H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae mainly accounted for those over 4 months of age. Susceptibility tests showed that 51% of H. influenzae isolates and 56.5% of S. pneumoniae isolates in 2008 were drug-resistant. Ampicillin combined with cephem antibiotics effective against GBS, E. coli, and Listeria, were mainly used to initially treat those under 4 months of age. In those over 4 months of age, carbapenem antibiotics are effective against PRSP and cephem antibiotics against H. influenza.
TI  - Characterization of a novel sialic acid transporter of the sodium solute symporter (SSS) family and in vivo comparison with known bacterial sialic acid transporters.
AB  - The function of sialic acids in the biology of bacterial pathogens is reflected by the diverse range of solute transporters that can recognize these sugar acids. Here, we use an Escherichia coliDeltananT strain to characterize the function of known and proposed bacterial sialic acid transporters. We discover that the STM1128 gene from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, which encodes a member of the sodium solute symporter family, is able to restore growth on sialic acid to the DeltananT strain and is able to transport [(14)C]-sialic acid. Using the DeltananT genetic background, we performed a direct in vivo comparison of the transport properties of the STM1128 protein with those of sialic acid transporters of the major facilitator superfamily and tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic families, E. coli NanT and Haemophilus influenzae SiaPQM, respectively. This revealed that both STM1128 and SiaPQM are sodium-dependent and, unlike SiaPQM, both STM1128 and NanT are reversible secondary carriers, demonstrating qualitative functional differences in the properties of sialic acid transporters used by bacteria that colonize humans.
TI  - Population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of meropenem in Japanese pediatric patients.
AB  - The aims of this study were to develop a population pharmacokinetic model for meropenem in Japanese pediatric patients, and to use this model to assess the pharmacodynamics of meropenem regimens against common bacterial populations. Pharmacokinetic data were pooled from nine separate studies (229 plasma samples and 61 urine samples from 40 infected children), modeled using the NONMEM program, and used for a pharmacodynamic simulation to estimate the probabilities of attaining the bactericidal target (40% of the time above the MIC for the bacterium). In the final population pharmacokinetic model, body weight (BW, kg) was the most significant covariate: Cl(r) (l/h) = 0.254 x BW, Cl(nr) (l/h) = 3.45, V (c) (l) = 0.272 x BW, Q (l/h) = 1.65, and V (p) (l) = 0.228 x BW, where Cl(r) and Cl(nr) are the renal and non-renal clearances, V (p) and V (c) are the volumes of distribution of the central and peripheral compartments, and Q is the intercompartmental (central-peripheral) clearance. In most typical patients (BW = 10, 20, and 30 kg), the approved regimens of 10-40 mg/kg, three times a day (0.5-h infusions), achieved a target attainment probability of >80% against Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. The results of this study provide a better understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of meropenem in Japanese pediatric patients.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic target attainment analysis of meropenem in Japanese adult patients.
AB  - This study was a pharmacokinetic (PK)-pharmacodynamic (PD) target attainment analysis of meropenem in Japanese adult patients. Plasma drug concentration data (265 samples from 42 patients) were used for population PK modeling and Monte Carlo simulation to assess the probability of attaining the PK-PD target (40% of the time above the MIC for the bacterium). The final population PK model identified creatinine clearance (Cl(cr), ml/min) and body weight (BW, kg) as the most significant covariates: Cl (l/h) = 0.0905 x Cl(cr) + 2.03, V(c)(l) = 0.199 9 BW, Q (l/h) = 4.02, and V(p) (l) = 4.55, where Cl is the clearance, Vc and Vp are the volumes of distribution of the central and peripheral compartments, respectively, and Q is the intercompartmental clearance. The Monte Carlo simulation developed the PK-PD breakpoints (the highest MIC values at which the probabilities of target attainment in plasma are 80% or more) for meropenem regimens, the values of which varied with the Cl(cr) and BW of the patient. The simulation also demonstrated that 0.25 g every 12 h (0.5-h infusion) achieved a target attainment probability of 82.4-100% against Escherichia coli, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. However, against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, 0.5 g every 8 h or 1 g every 8 h was required to achieve 80% or more probability in most typical patients. These results provide a PK-PD-based strategy for tailoring a meropenem regimen according to Clcr and BW of a Japanese adult patient and susceptibility of the causative bacteria.
TI  - Inhibitory mechanism of novel inhibitors of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase from Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Bacterial UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase (MurA) catalyzes the transfer of enolpyruvate from phosphoenolphyruvate (PEP) to uridine diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine (UNAG), which is the first step of bacterial cell wall synthesis. We identified thimerosal, thiram, and ebselen as effective inhibitors of Heamophilus influenzae MurA by screening a chemical library that consisted of a wide range of bioactive compounds. When MurA was preincubated with these inhibitors, their 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) were found to range from 0.1 to 0.7 microM. In particular, thimerosal suppressed the growth of several different Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium at a concentration range of 1-2 microg/ml. These inhibitors covalently modified the cysteine residue near the active site of MurA. This modification changed the open conformation of MurA to a more closed configuration, which may have prevented the necessary conformational change from occurring during the enzyme reaction.
TI  - Characterization of the Haemophilus influenzae tehB gene and its role in virulence.
AB  - The Haemophilus influenzae ORF designated HI1275 in the Rd KW20 genomic sequence  encodes a putative S-adenosyl methyltransferase with significant similarity to tellurite-resistance determinants (tehB) in other species. While the H. influenzae tehB can complement an Escherichia coli tehB mutation, thus restoring tellurite resistance, its role in H. influenzae is unknown. In a previous study defining the iron and haem modulon of H. influenzae, we showed that transcription of this gene in H. influenzae Rd KW20 increases during growth in iron- and haem-restricted media. Since iron and haem uptake genes, and other known virulence factors, constitute the majority of the iron- and haem-regulated gene set, we postulated that tehB may play a role in nutrient acquisition and/or the virulence of H. influenzae. A tehB mutant was constructed in the H. influenzae type b strain 10810 and was evaluated for growth defects in various supplemented media, as well as for its ability to cause infection in rat models of infection. Deletion of tehB leads to an increase in sensitivity both to tellurite and to the oxidizing agents cumene hydroperoxide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide and hydrogen peroxide. The tehB mutant additionally showed a significantly reduced ability to utilize free haem as well as several haem-containing moieties including haem-human serum albumin, haemoglobin and haemoglobin-haptoglobin. Examination of the regulation kinetics indicated that transcription of tehB was independent of both tellurite exposure and oxidative stress. Paired comparisons of the tehB mutant and the wild-type H. influenzae strain 10810 showed that tehB is required for wild-type levels of infection in rat models of H. influenzae invasive disease. To our knowledge this is the first report of a role for tehB in virulence in any bacterial species. These data demonstrate that H. influenzae tehB plays a role in both resistance to oxidative damage and haem uptake/utilization, protects H. influenzae from tellurite exposure, and is important for virulence of this organism in an animal model of invasive disease.
TI  - Population pharmacokinetic modeling and pharmacodynamic assessment of cefozopran  in pediatric patients.
AB  - The aims of this study were to develop a population pharmacokinetic model for cefozopran in pediatric patients, and to use this model to evaluate the pharmacodynamics of cefozopran regimens against common bacterial populations. Plasma drug concentration data (110 samples from 31 pediatric patients) were modeled using the NONMEM program. The mean estimate and interindividual variance of the model were used in a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the probabilities of attaining the bactericidal target for cefozopran (the time which the drug concentration remains above the minimum inhibitory concentration for the bacterium is 70% of the dosing interval). A two-compartment model fitted the data and body weight (BW, kg) was the most significant covariate. The final model was: Cl (l/h) = 0.674 x BW0.538, Vc (l) = 0.00233 x BW2.25 + 1.85, Q (l/h) = 1.46, and Vp (l) = 0.0964 x BW, where Cl is the clearance, Vc, and Vp are the volumes of distribution of the central and peripheral compartments, and Q is the intercompartmental clearance. The approved regimens of 20- or 40-mg/kg four times a day (0.5-h infusions), which were more effective than the corresponding three times a day-regimens, provided sufficient bactericidal effects on common bacterial populations (Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) in most typical patients. These results better define the pharmacokinetics of cefozopran and help in the choice of appropriate regimens for pediatric patients.
TI  - Deletion of penicillin-binding protein 5 (PBP5) sensitises Escherichia coli cells to beta-lactam agents.
AB  - Escherichia coli penicillin-binding protein 5 (PBP5), a dd-carboxypeptidase encoded by the dacA gene, plays a key role in the maintenance of cell shape. Although PBP5 shares one of the highest copy numbers among the PBPs, it is not essential for cell survival. To determine the effect of this redundant PBP on beta-lactam antibiotic susceptibility, PBP5 was deleted from O-antigen-negative E. coli K-12 (CS109) and O8-antigen-positive E. coli 2443, thus creating strains AM15-1 and AG1O5-1, respectively. Compared with the parent strains, both mutants were four- to eight-fold more susceptible to all the beta-lactam antibiotics tested. Reversion to beta-lactam resistance was observed in the mutants upon complementing with cloned PBP5, indicating the involvement of PBP5 in maintaining an O-antigen-independent intrinsic beta-lactam resistance in E. coli cells. To check whether other dacA homologues were able to substitute this behaviour of E. coli PBP5, AG1O5-1 was complemented with its nearest dacA homologues (Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2, Vibrio cholerae and Haemophilus influenzae). All of the cloned homologues were capable of restoring the lost beta-lactam resistance in AG1O5-1, either completely or at least partially. Therefore, apart from maintaining cell shape, involvement of PBP5 in maintaining intrinsic beta-lactam resistance is an important physiological observation and we speculate that such a strategy of deleting PBP5 may be helpful to introduce beta-lactam susceptibility in the laboratory.
TI  - Mechanisms of meningeal invasion by a bacterial extracellular pathogen, the example of Neisseria meningitidis.
AB  - The blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier physiologically protects the meningeal spaces from bloodborne bacterial pathogens, due to the existence of specialized junctional interendothelial complexes. A few bacterial pathogens are able to reach the subarachnoidal space and cause bacterial meningitis in humans, a rare but dreadful disease. Surprisingly, most of them are extracellular commensals of the nasopharynx (Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae) or of the digestive tract (Escherichia coli and Streptococcus agalactiae). The particular ability of these pathogens to induce meningitis is related to virulence factors that allow them to escape host innate immunity, to multiply within the serum, and to interact closely with the endothelial front line of defense of the blood-CSF barrier. In vitro studies using microvascular brain endothelial cell lines have shown that induced transcytosis may be a common route used by H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, E. coli and S. agalactiae to reach the CSF. N. meningitidis is a strict human pathogen that interacts very tightly with endothelial cells. Adhesion of the meningococcus is mediated by type IV pili that induce a localized remodeling of the sub cortical cytoskeleton, leading to the formation of endothelial membrane protrusions that anchor bacterial colonies at the endoluminal face of the endothelial cell membrane, allowing a better resistance to blood flow. Recent work has shown that N. meningitidis is also able to recruit the polarity complex Par3/Par6/aPKC that re-routes endothelial cell adhesion molecules of interendothelial junctions, opening a paracellular route for bacteria to cross the endothelial barrier.
TI  - Microbiological findings in prepubertal girls with vulvovaginitis.
AB  - The aim of the study was to define the most common causes, symptoms and clinical  features of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls, and to evaluate treatment success depending on the causative agent involved. The study included 115 girls aged 2-8 (mean 4.8) years, presenting with vulvovaginitis to the Outpatient Clinic for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology, Zagreb Children's Hospital, between September 2006 and July 2007. Medical history data were obtained from parents. Vaginal samples were collected for microbiological culture by using cotton-tipped swabs moistened with saline. All samples were referred to microbiology laboratory, where standard microbiological diagnostic procedures were performed. Selective and non-selective media were used. Of 115 study patients, 43 (37.4%) had received antibiotic therapy more than one month prior to their visit to the Clinic, mainly for upper respiratory tract infection. The most common presenting symptom was increased vaginal discharge usually noticed on the pants or diaper, found in 26 of 115 (22.6%) patients, followed by vulvar redness in 16 (13.9%), burning in seven (6.1%), itching in the vulvovaginal area in seven (6.1%), soreness in six (5.2%), odor in three (2.6%) patients, and two or more of these symptoms in another 50 (43.5%) patients. Fifty-nine of 115 children had normal clinical finding on gynecologic examination. Among the remaining 56 children, the most common finding was erythema observed in 19, vaginal discharge in ten, and a combination of discharge and erythema in 13 patients. Of 115 study patients, causative agents were isolated from vaginal culture in 38 (33%) cases. Of these, 21 grew group A beta hemolytic streptococcus, five patients Haemophilus influenzae, three Escherichia coli, two Enterococcus spp., and one each Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Antibiotic therapy was administered in 31 of these 38 patients, except for those cases where intestinal bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus were isolated and topical therapy and hygienic measures were applied alone. Accordingly, vulvovaginitis in girls was most commonly caused by pathogens originating from the patient upper respiratory tract, accompanied by the symptoms of redness and vaginal discharge. In these cases, antibiotic treatment was administered. In the majority of prepubertal girls with either vulvitis or normal genital finding, simple measures to improve hygiene will lead to resolution of all symptoms.
TI  - [Cloning Hap gene from non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae and expression of Hap  protein in prokaryotic cell].
AB  - This study was aimed to construct a prokaryotic expressing vector of Hap gene from Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, and express and identify the fusion proteins of Hap-His in E. coli. The gene encoding protein Hap was amplified from Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae ATCC49247 chromosomal DNA by PCR, then it was cloned into prokaryotic expression plasmid pET-32a (+). The recombinant plasmid pET-32a(+)-Hap was transformed into E. coli BL21 and expression was induced by Isopropy-beta-D-thiogalatoside(IPTG). The Hap-His fusion protein expressed so was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western-blot. The results showed that the recombinant expressive plasmid pET-32a (+)-Hap was constructed successfully, and the recombinant plasmid expressed Hap-His fusion protein with relative molecule mass 176 000 and mainly existed in inclusion body. This fusion protein could combine with anti-His monoclonal antibody specifically through Western blot analysis. Successful expression of Hap-His fusion protein in prokaryotic cell could lay a basis for further study of immunocompetence of Hap protein and development of NTHi vaccine.
TI  - Purification and characterization of the lipid A disaccharide synthase (LpxB) from Escherichia coli, a peripheral membrane protein.
AB  - Escherichia coli LpxB, an inverting glycosyl transferase of the GT-B superfamily  and a member of CAZy database family 19, catalyzes the fifth step of lipid A biosynthesis: UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine + 2,3-diacylglucosamine 1-phosphate --> 2',3'-diacylglucosamine-(beta,1'-6)-2,3-diacylglucosamine 1-phosphate + UDP. LpxB is a target for the development of new antibiotics, but no member of family 19, which consists entirely of LpxB orthologues, has been characterized mechanistically or structurally. Here, we have purified E. coli and Haemophilus influenzae LpxB to near homogeneity on a 10-100 mg scale using protease-cleavable His(10)-tagged constructs. E. coli LpxB activity is dependent upon the bulk surface concentration of its substrates in a mixed micelle assay system, suggesting that catalysis occurs at the membrane interface. E. coli LpxB (M(r) approximately 43 kDa) sediments with membranes at low salt concentrations but is largely solubilized with buffers of high ionic strength. It purifies with 1.6-3.5 mol of phospholipid/mol of LpxB polypeptide. Transmission electron microscopy reveals the accumulation of aberrant intracellular membranes when LpxB is overexpressed. Mutagenesis of LpxB identified two conserved residues, D89A and R201A, for which no residual catalytic activity was detected. Our results provide a rational starting point for structural studies.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,919 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2007].
AB  - We have reported in this journal in vitro susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics every year since 1992. In this paper, we report the results of an analysis of in vitro susceptibilities of 12,919 clinical isolates from 72 centers in Japan to selected antibiotics in 2007 compared with the results from previous years. The common respiratory pathogens, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae maintained a high susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (FQs). The resistance of S. pyogenes to macrolides has been increasing every year and this was especially clear this year. Most strains of Enterobacteriaceae except for Escherichia coli showed a high susceptibility to FQs. Almost 30% of E. coli strains were resistant to FQs and the resistance increased further this year. FQs resistance of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was approximately 95% with the exception of 45% for sitafloxacin (STFX). FQs resistance of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) was low at about 10%. FQs resistance of methicillin-resistant coagulase negative Staphylococci (MRCNS) was higher than that of methicillin-susceptible coagulase negative Staphylococci (MSCNS), but it was lower than that of MRSA. However, FQs resistance of MSCNS was higher than that of MSSA. FQs resistance of Enterococcus faecalis was 22.5% to 29.6%, while that of Enterococcusfaecium was more than 85% except for STFX (58.3%). In clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa derived from urinary tract infections, FQs resistance was 21-27%, which was higher than that of P. aeruginosa from respiratory tract infections at 13-21%, which was the same trend as in past years. Multidrug resistant strains accounted for 5.6% in the urinary tract and 1.8% in the respiratory tract. Acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to FQs. The carbapenem resistant strains, which present a problem at present, accounted for 2.7%. Neisseria gonorrhoeae showed high resistance of 86-88% to FQs. The results of the present survey indicated that although methicillin-resistant Staphylococci, Enterococci, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and N. gonorrhoeae showed resistance tendencies, and other species maintained high susceptibility rates more than 90% against FQs, which have been used clinically for over 15 years.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of oral levofloxacin 500 mg once-daily dosage for treatment of lower respiratory tract infections and urinary tract infections: a prospective multicenter study in China.
AB  - Levofloxacin (LVFX), a fluoroquinolone agent, has a broad spectrum that covers Gram-positive and -negative bacteria and atypical pathogens. It demonstrates good clinical efficacy in the treatment of various infections, including lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) and urinary tract infections (UTIs). To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral LVFX 500 mg once daily, a large open-label clinical trial was conducted in 1266 patients (899 with LRTIs and 367 with UTIs) at 32 centers in China. In the per-protocol population, the clinical efficacy rate (cure or improvement) at 7 to 14 days after the end of treatment was 96.4% (666/691) for LRTIs and 95.7% (267/279) for UTIs. In 53 patients diagnosed with atypical pneumonia the treatment was effective. The bacteriological efficacy rate was 96.6% (256/265) for LRTIs and 93.3% (126/135) for UTIs. The eradication rate of the causative pathogens was 100% (33/33) for Haemophilus influenzae and 96.0% (24/25) for Streptococcus pneumoniae in LRTIs, and 94.1% (80/85) for Escherichia coli in UTIs. The overall efficacy rates were 89.3% (617/691) for LRTIs and 87.8% (245/279) for UTIs. The incidence of drug-related adverse events (ADRs) was 17.3% (215/1245), and the incidence of drug-related laboratory abnormalities was 15.7% (191/1213). Common ADRs were dizziness, nausea, and insomnia. Common laboratory abnormalities included "WBC decreased", "alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased", "aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased", and "lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) increased". All of these events were mentioned in the package inserts of fluoroquinolones including LVFX, and most events were mild and transient. Thirty-four patients (2.7%) were withdrawn from the study because of the ADRs. No new ADRs were found. This study concluded that the dosage regimen of LVFX 500 mg once daily was effective and tolerable for the treatment of LRTIs and UTIs.
TI  - Rapid detection of ESBL-producing gram-negative bacteria isolated from blood: a reasonable and reliable tool for middle and low resource countries.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Delay in appropriate treatment in patients with bacteraemia can increase morbidity, mortality, and health expenditures. We compared the Rapid Direct Test (RDT) designed to detect ESBL-producing gram-negative bacteria (GNB) directly from positive blood cultures bottles, with two conventional ESBL detection tests: Screening and Confirmatory Disk Diffusion Assay (SC-DDA) and an MIC Screening and ESBL E-test (MIC/ET). MATERIAL AND METHODS: We screened all blood cultures in a tertiary care facility from August to December 2005. We only included one positive bottle per patient in which GNB were observed. RDT: Blood from each bottle was inoculated on Mueller-Hinton agar. Ceftazidime and cefotaxime disks with and without clavulanic acid were added and incubated at 35 degrees C +/- 2 degrees C for 24 h. Results were interpreted according to CLSI recommendations for the SC-DDA and MIC/ET. All methods were performed simultaneously. Time for reporting as an ESBL-producer and cost of the tests were recorded. RESULTS: We isolated 124 GNB in 114 episodes of bacteraemia, 10 of them (8.8%) polymicrobial; 79 (63.7%) of the GNB were enteric bacteria, 44 (35.5%) glucose non-fermenter GNB and one Haemophilus influenzae. The most common microorganism was Escherichia coli in 56 episodes (45.2%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 24 (19.3%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 13 (10.5%). Of the 114 episodes, 41 (36%) had at least one GNB resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporins, and 25 (21.9%) were caused by an ESBL-producing GNB. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for the RDT were 96%, 98.9%, 96% and 98.9%, respectively. Agreement by kappa index between RDT and SC-DDA was 0.95 and between the RDT and MIC/ET was 0.92. The RDT detected 24/25 ESBL-producing bacteria. The mean time to detect an isolate as an ESBL producer after a positive blood culture bottle signal was 1.02 +/- 0.19 days when using the RDT, and 3.40 +/- 0.59 days when using any other method. The difference in reporting time was 2.38 +/- 0.63 days (p < 0.0001). Our estimated cost per test was $1.54 for RDT, $2.32 for screening/ confirmatory SC-DDA, and $49.65 for MIC screening and MIC/ET. Conclusions. The RDT is a rapid, reliable and easy analysis to perform, as well as cost-effective.
TI  - A soluble RecN homologue provides means for biochemical and genetic analysis of DNA double-strand break repair in Escherichia coli.
AB  - RecN is a highly conserved, SMC-like protein in bacteria. It plays an important role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks and is therefore a key factor in maintaining genome integrity. The insolubility of Escherichia coli RecN has limited efforts to unravel its function. We overcame this limitation by replacing the resident coding sequence with that of Haemophilus influenzae RecN. The heterologous construct expresses Haemophilus RecN from the SOS-inducible E. coli promoter. The hybrid gene is fully functional, promoting survival after I-SceI induced DNA breakage, gamma irradiation or exposure to mitomycin C as effectively as the native gene, indicating that the repair activity is conserved between these two species. H. influenzae RecN is quite soluble, even when expressed at high levels, and is readily purified. Its analysis by ionisation-mass spectrometry, gel filtration and glutaraldehyde crosslinking indicates that it is probably a dimer under physiological conditions, although a higher multimer cannot be excluded. The purified protein displays a weak ATPase activity that is essential for its DNA repair function in vivo. However, no DNA-binding activity was detected, which contrasts with RecN from Bacillus subtilis. RecN proteins from Aquifex aeolicus and Bacteriodes fragilis also proved soluble. Neither binds DNA, but the Aquifex RecN has weak ATPase activity. Our findings support studies indicating that RecN, and the SOS response in general, behave differently in E. coli and B. subtilis. The hybrid recN reported provides new opportunities to study the genetics and biochemistry of how RecN operates in E. coli.
TI  - The changing aetiology of paediatric bacteraemia in England and Wales, 1998-2007.
AB  - Bacteraemia in children is a potentially life-threatening condition. The objective of this study was to determine trends in the aetiology of bacteraemia in children aged 1 month-15 years in England and Wales by collecting data voluntarily reported by National Health Service hospital microbiology laboratories. Over the 10-year period 1998-2007, a total of 51 788 bacteraemia cases involving 105 genera/species of bacteria were reported. Total annual reports of bacteraemia increased from 4125 to 6916, with a mean increase of 6.5 % per year (95 % CI: 1.3-12.1 %). In 2007, just over half the cases were accounted for by four groups of organisms: coagulase-negative staphylococci (28 %), Staphylococcus aureus (10 %), non-pyogenic streptococci (9 %) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (7 %). These organisms along with a further 13 species/genera accounted for 90 % of the cases. The commonest Gram-negative organisms were Neisseria meningitidis and Escherichia coli, which each accounted for 5 % of total bacteraemia reports in 2007. There was a significant decrease in reports of bacteraemia due to the three vaccine-preventable pathogens Haemophilus influenzae, N. meningitidis and Strep. pneumoniae, following the introduction of each vaccine programme or catch-up campaign. This study identified the commonest causes of bacteraemia in children in England and Wales, and highlighted the shifts in trends observed over time.
TI  - Inhibitors of bacterial N-succinyl-L,L-diaminopimelic acid desuccinylase (DapE) and demonstration of in vitro antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The dapE-encoded N-succinyl-L,L-diaminopimelic acid desuccinylase (DapE) is a critical bacterial enzyme for the construction of the bacterial cell wall. A screen biased toward compounds containing zinc-binding groups (ZBG's) including thiols, carboxylic acids, boronic acids, phosphonates and hydroxamates has delivered a number of micromolar inhibitors of DapE from Haemophilus influenzae, including the low micromolar inhibitor L-captopril (IC(50)=3.3 microM, K(i)=1.8 microM). In vitro antimicrobial activity was demonstrated for L-captopril against Escherichia coli.
TI  - New diagnostic and therapeutic options in bacterial meningitis in infants and children.
AB  - Bacterial meningitis continues to be an important cause of mortality and morbidity in neonates and children through the world. Current strategies to prevention and therapy of bacterial meningitis are compromised by incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis, emergence of antimicrobial resistant microorganisms and lack of simple diagnostic tools in resource-limited settings. Successful prevention and treatment of bacterial meningitis requires the knowledge on epidemiology including prevalence of antimicrobial resistant pathogens, pathogenesis of meningitis, and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antimicrobial agents. The introduction of the protein conjugate vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis has changed the epidemiology of bacterial meningitis. Suspected bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency and requires empiric antimicrobial therapy without delay, but recognition of pathogens with increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents is an important factor in selection of empiric antimicrobial regimen. A more complete knowledge on the pathogenesis of meningitis is likely to help in development of new diagnostic and therapeutic options for infants and children with bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Bacteriology of external ocular infections in Aba, South Eastern Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria are microbial agents that frequently cause infections of the eye and possible loss of vision. METHOD: The common isolates were studied in 298 bacterial infections of the anterior eye, consisting of 35 blepharitis, 208 conjunctivitis and 55 keratitis. Isolates were cultured in blood agar and chocolate agar. Each strain's susceptibility to the antibiotics was determined using a standard table of antibiotic susceptibility. RESULTS: In decreasing order of frequency, the implicated bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus 80 (23.7 per cent), Staphylococcus albus 65 (19.2 per cent), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 34 (10.1 per cent), Streptococcus pneumoniae 29 (8.6 per cent), Haemophilus influenzae 26 (7.7 per cent), Streptococcus pyogene 20 (6.2 per cent), Klebsiella pneumoniae 18 (6.2 per cent), Escherichia coli 15 (4.4 per cent), Neisseria gonorrhoeae 13 (3.9 per cent), Streptococcus viridans 11 (3.5 per cent), Moraxella catarrhalis 10 (3.0 per cent), Streptococcus faecalis 5 (1.5 per cent), Proteus mirabilis 5 (1.5 per cent) and Neisseria meningitides 1 (0.3 per cent). Bacteria were isolated most frequently from infections of the conjunctiva (222, 66.7 per cent), then the cornea (65, 20.1 per cent) and least from the eyelids (44, 13.2 per cent). Bacterial isolates varied in their clinical features (p < 0.01). The age distribution showed isolations of 77 (23.2 per cent) and 79 (23.7 per cent) in the age groups of newborn to under three years and three to under 12 years, respectively. This was comparable to 66 (19.8 per cent) for the 12 to under 18 years, 61 (18.3 per cent) for the 18 to under 40 years age group and 50 (15 per cent) for those 40 years and above. Bacterial isolates had no predilection for the age of patients (p < 0.95). Conjunctivitis was diagnosed more in children, 60 (28.8 per cent) in the newborn to under three years and 53 (25.5 per cent) in the three to under 12 years age groups. Blepharitis was diagnosed most frequently (15, 42.8 per cent) in adolescents 12 to under 18 years, while keratitis was more in adults (20, 36.4 per cent) in the 18 to under 40 years and (15, 27.3 per cent) in the 40 years and above. Diagnosis varied among age groups but there was no relationship between sex and diagnosis (p < 0.75). Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most resistant to all the anti-bacterial preparations. The bacterial isolates were more susceptible to the second generation quinolones than the first. CONCLUSION: The study recommends that quinolones be available as ophthalmic preparations to be prescribed by the qualified practitioners to avoid development of resistance from indiscriminate use.
TI  - Pneumonia in severely malnourished children in developing countries - mortality risk, aetiology and validity of WHO clinical signs: a systematic review.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To quantify the degree by which moderate and severe degrees of malnutrition increase the mortality risk in pneumonia, to identify potential differences in the aetiology of pneumonia between children with and without severe malnutrition, and to evaluate the validity of WHO-recommended clinical signs (age-specific fast breathing and chest wall indrawing) for the diagnosis of pneumonia in severely malnourished children. METHODS: Systematic search of the existing literature using a variety of databases (Medline, EMBASE, the Web of Science, Scopus and CINAHL). RESULTS: Mortality risk: Sixteen relevant studies were identified, which universally showed that children with pneumonia and moderate or severe malnutrition are at higher risk of death. For severe malnutrition, reported relative risks ranged from 2.9 to 121.2; odds ratios ranged from 2.5 to 15.1. For moderate malnutrition, relative risks ranged from 1.2 to 36.5. Aetiology: Eleven studies evaluated the aetiology of pneumonia in severely malnourished children. Commonly isolated bacterial pathogens were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Haemophilus influenzae. The spectrum and frequency of organisms differed from those reported in children without severe malnutrition. There are very few data on the role of respiratory viruses and tuberculosis. Clinical signs: Four studies investigating the validity of clinical signs showed that WHO-recommended clinical signs were less sensitive as predictors of radiographic pneumonia in severely malnourished children. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumonia and malnutrition are two of the biggest killers in childhood. Guidelines for the care of children with pneumonia and malnutrition need to take into account this strong and often lethal association if they are to contribute to the UN Millennium Development Goal 4, aiming for substantial reductions in childhood mortality. Additional data regarding the optimal diagnostic approach to and management of pneumonia and malnutrition are required from regions where death from these two diseases is common.
TI  - Invasive bacteria isolates from children with severe infections in a Nigerian hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little information is available about the aetiology and epidemiology  of serious bacterial infections in Nigeria. This study determined bacterial isolates from blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of children presenting in the emergency room of a teaching hospital in Nigeria. METHOD: From October 2005 to December 2006, children aged two to 60 months presenting with signs of acute systemic infections were recruited. Blood culture and CSF specimens were collected and processed using standard microbiological protocols. Data were analysed using SPSS version 11 software. RESULTS: Two hundred and two blood and 69 CSF samples were cultured. Fifty-five (27%) of the blood cultures yielded Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci in almost equal proportions. The most common isolates from the blood cultures were Staphylococcus aureus, 26 (12.9%) and atypical coliforms, 13 (6.5%). Others are Klebsiella spp, 3 (1.5%); Klebsiella pneumonia, 2 (1.0%); Escherichia coli, 3 (1.5%); Enterobacter agglomerans, 2 (1.1%); Proteus mirabilis, 2(1%); Pseudomonas spp, 2 (1.0%); Haemophilus influenza, 1 (1.0%); and Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, 1 (1.0%). Fourteen out of 67 (20.9%) of the CSF samples yielded bacterial isolates: Streptococcus pneumonia, 3 (4.5%); Haemophilus influenza, 8 (11.9%); Hemophilus spp, 1 (1.5%); E. Coli, 1 (1.5%); and atypical coliform, 1 (1.5%). Gram-negative coliform isolates were predominantly resistant to penicillin based antibiotics and co-trimoxazole but sensitive to third-generation cephalosporins and quinolones. A high percentage of S. aureus isolates were multi-drug resistant. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial infections contribute to the significant morbidity among children in our environment. S. aureus was more frequently isolated in sepsis while H. influenzae appears to play a major role in meningitis. Appropriate use of antibiotics is needed to manage affected children effectively. We also recommend improved vaccine coverage of children under the age of five years.
TI  - Bacteraemia in Kenyan children with sickle-cell anaemia: a retrospective cohort and case-control study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In sub-Saharan Africa, more than 90% of children with sickle-cell anaemia die before the diagnosis can be made. The causes of death are poorly documented, but bacterial sepsis is probably important. We examined the risk of invasive bacterial diseases in children with sickle-cell anaemia. METHODS: This study was undertaken in a rural area on the coast of Kenya, with a case-control approach. We undertook blood cultures on all children younger than 14 years who were admitted from within a defined study area to Kilifi District Hospital between Aug 1, 1998, and March 31, 2008; those with bacteraemia were defined as cases. We used two sets of controls: children recruited by random sampling in the same area into several studies undertaken between Sept 1, 1998, and Nov 30, 2005; and those born consecutively within the area between May 1, 2006, and April 30, 2008. Cases and controls were tested for sickle-cell anaemia retrospectively. FINDINGS: We detected 2157 episodes of bacteraemia in 38 441 admissions (6%). 1749 of these children with bacteraemia (81%) were typed for sickle-cell anaemia, of whom 108 (6%) were positive as were 89 of 13 492 controls (1%). The organisms most commonly isolated from children with sickle-cell anaemia were Streptococcus pneumoniae (44/108 isolates; 41%), non-typhi Salmonella species (19/108; 18%), Haemophilus influenzae type b (13/108; 12%), Acinetobacter species (seven of 108; 7%), and Escherichia coli (seven of 108; 7%). The age-adjusted odds ratio for bacteraemia in children with sickle-cell anaemia was 26.3 (95% CI 14.5-47.6), with the strongest associations for S pneumoniae (33.0, 17.4-62.8), non-typhi Salmonella species (35.5, 16.4-76.8), and H influenzae type b (28.1, 12.0-65.9). INTERPRETATION: The organisms causing bacteraemia in African children with sickle-cell anaemia are the same as those in developed countries. Introduction of conjugate vaccines against S pneumoniae and H influenzae into the childhood immunisation schedules of African countries could substantially affect survival of children with sickle-cell anaemia.

TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms: tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial 2004 to 2007.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial began in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. Against Gram negatives (n = 63 699), tigecycline MIC(90)'s ranged from 0.25 to 2 mg/L for Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens (but was > or =32 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Against Gram-positive organisms (n = 32 218), tigecycline MIC(90)'s were between 0.06 and 0.25 mg/L for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. The in vitro activity of tigecycline was maintained against resistant phenotypes, including multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (9.2% of isolates), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli (7.0%) and K. pneumoniae (14.0%), beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae (22.2%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (44.5%), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (45.9%) and E. faecalis (2.8%), and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (13.8%). Tigecycline represents a welcome addition to the armamentarium against difficult to treat organisms.
TI  - The dppBCDF gene cluster of Haemophilus influenzae: Role in heme utilization.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Haemophilus influenzae requires a porphyrin source for aerobic growth and possesses multiple mechanisms to obtain this essential nutrient. This porphyrin requirement may be satisfied by either heme alone, or protoporphyrin IX in the presence of an iron source. One protein involved in heme acquisition by H. influenzae is the periplasmic heme binding protein HbpA. HbpA exhibits significant homology to the dipeptide and heme binding protein DppA of Escherichia coli. DppA is a component of the DppABCDF peptide-heme permease of E. coli. H. influenzae homologs of dppBCDF are located in the genome at a point distant from hbpA. The object of this study was to investigate the potential role of the H. influenzae dppBCDF locus in heme utilization. FINDINGS: An insertional mutation in dppC was constructed and the impact of the mutation on the utilization of both free heme and various proteinaceous heme sources as well as utilization of protoporphyrin IX was determined in growth curve studies. The dppC insertion mutant strain was significantly impacted in utilization of all tested heme sources and protoporphyin IX. Complementation of the dppC mutation with an intact dppCBDF gene cluster in trans corrected the growth defects seen in the dppC mutant strain. CONCLUSION: The dppCBDF gene cluster constitutes part of the periplasmic heme-acquisition systems of H. influenzae.
TI  - Clinical significance of cerebrospinal fluid inhibitory titers of antibiotics, based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters, in the treatment of bacterial meningitis.
AB  - The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inhibitory titer (CSF-IT) of an antibiotic, which can be used to estimate the duration of time above the agent's MIC in the CSF, was introduced as one of the indices to evaluate the effectiveness of antibiotic selection in treating bacterial meningitis. The CSF-IT was determined via a microdilution method. A suspension of the causative organism was added to a tube containing twofold diluted CSF and double-concentrated Mueller-Hinton broth with supplement. The CSF-IT was determined by the maximum point without turbidity of medium after overnight incubation at 37 degrees C. Concerning the strain of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae (BLNAR), the killing rates of both meropenem and piperacillin were compared in an in vitro pharmacokinetic (PK) model, in which human pharmacokinetics in CSF were simulated. Organisms recovered from the CSF in 37 treated clinical cases of bacterial meningitis were H. influenzae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Neisseria meningitidis; in these cases, the CSF-IT ranged from 1: 8 to as high as 1: 4 096. In the in vitro PK model, the concentrations of both drugs were higher than the MICs over a period of 24 h; however, the killing rate of piperacillin was higher than that of meropenem, and bacterial regrowth was observed after the administration of meropenem. A CSF-IT value higher than 1: 32 indicates that the antibiotic concentration in the CSF exceeds the MIC for 24 h. The effect of piperacillin on BLNAR depends not only on the time above MIC of 24 h but also on the maximum concentration in the CSF.
TI  - Molecular characterization of phosphorylcholine expression on the lipooligosaccharide of Histophilus somni.
AB  - Histophilus somni (Haemophilus somnus) is an important pathogen of cattle that is responsible for respiratory disease, septicemia, and systemic diseases such as thrombotic meningoencephalitis, myocarditis, and abortion. A variety of virulence factors have been identified in H. somni, including compositional and antigenic variation of the lipooligosaccharide (LOS). Phosphorylcholine (ChoP) has been identified as one of the components of H. somni LOS that undergoes antigenic variation. In this study, five genes (lic1ABCD(Hs) and glpQ) with homology to genes responsible for ChoP expression in Haemophilus influenzae LOS were identified in the H. somni genome. An H. somni open reading frame (ORF) with homology to H. influenzae lic1A (lic1A(Hi)) contained a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR). However, whereas the tetranucleotide repeat 5'-CAAT-3' is present in lic1A(Hi), the VNTR in H. somni lic1A (lic1A(Hs)) consisted of 5'-AACC-3'. Due to the propensity of VNTR to vary during replication and cause the ORF to shift in and out of frame with the upstream start codon, the VNTR were deleted from lic1A(Hs) to maintain the gene constitutively on. This construct was cloned into Escherichia coli, and functional enzyme assays confirmed that lic1A(Hs) encoded a choline kinase, and that the VNTR were not required for expression of a functional gene product. Variation in the number of VNTR in lic1A(Hs) correlated with antigenic variation of ChoP expression in H. somni strain 124P. However, antigenic variation of ChoP expression in strain 738 predominately occurred through variable extension/truncation of the LOS outer core. These results indicated that the lic1(Hs) genes controlled expression of ChoP on the LOS, but that in H. somni there are two potential mechanisms that account for antigenic variation of ChoP.
TI  - The population and evolutionary dynamics of homologous gene recombination in bacterial populations.
AB  - In bacteria, recombination is a rare event, not a part of the reproductive process. Nevertheless, recombination -- broadly defined to include the acquisition of genes from external sources, i.e., horizontal gene transfer (HGT) -- plays a central role as a source of variation for adaptive evolution in many species of bacteria. Much of niche expansion, resistance to antibiotics and other environmental stresses, virulence, and other characteristics that make bacteria interesting and problematic, is achieved through the expression of genes and genetic elements obtained from other populations of bacteria of the same and different species, as well as from eukaryotes and archaea. While recombination of homologous genes among members of the same species has played a central role in the development of the genetics and molecular biology of bacteria, the contribution of homologous gene recombination (HGR) to bacterial evolution is not at all clear. Also, not so clear are the selective pressures responsible for the evolution and maintenance of transformation, the only bacteria-encoded form of HGR. Using a semi-stochastic simulation of mutation, recombination, and selection within bacterial populations and competition between populations, we explore (1) the contribution of HGR to the rate of adaptive evolution in these populations and (2) the conditions under which HGR will provide a bacterial population a selective advantage over non-recombining or more slowly recombining populations. The results of our simulation indicate that, under broad conditions: (1) HGR occurring at rates in the range anticipated for bacteria like Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacillus subtilis will accelerate the rate at which a population adapts to environmental conditions; (2) once established in a population, selection for this capacity to increase rates of adaptive evolution can maintain bacteria-encoded mechanisms of recombination and prevent invasion of non-recombining populations, even when recombination engenders a modest fitness cost; and (3) because of the density- and frequency-dependent nature of HGR in bacteria, this capacity to increase rates of adaptive evolution is not sufficient as a selective force to provide a recombining population a selective advantage when it is rare. Under realistic conditions, homologous gene recombination will increase the rate of adaptive evolution in bacterial populations and, once established, selection for higher rates of evolution will promote the maintenance of bacteria-encoded mechanisms for HGR. On the other hand, increasing rates of adaptive evolution by HGR is unlikely to be the sole or even a dominant selective pressure responsible for the original evolution of transformation.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of a fosfomycin/tobramycin combination: a novel inhaled  antibiotic for bronchiectasis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the in vitro and in vivo activities of a 4:1 (w/w) fosfomycin/tobramycin combination (FTI) with those of fosfomycin and tobramycin alone against cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF bronchiectasis pathogens. METHODS: Clinical isolates of CF Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Burkholderia cepacia complex, Escherichia coli and Klebsiellia spp. were evaluated by MIC, MBC, post-antibiotic effect (PAE), synergy, time-kill, a rat pneumonia model and spontaneous mutation frequency (SMF). RESULTS: FTI showed high activity against E. coli, H. influenzae, S. aureus and Klebsiella spp. For the S. aureus strains, 75% of which were methicillin resistant (MRSA), FTI had a lower MIC(90) than tobramycin. For P. aeruginosa, FTI had a lower MIC(90) than fosfomycin, but tobramycin was more active than either. Synergy studies showed no antagonism between fosfomycin and tobramycin, and 93% of the isolates demonstrated no interaction. FTI was rapidly bactericidal and exhibited concentration-dependent killing in time-kill studies. In the rat pneumonia model, FTI and tobramycin demonstrated bactericidal killing of P. aeruginosa; both were more active than fosfomycin alone. The SMF for S. aureus resistance to FTI was 2-4 log(10) lower than that for tobramycin and 2-7 log(10) lower than that for fosfomycin. For P. aeruginosa, the FTI SMF was 2-3 log(10) lower than that for fosfomycin and 1-2 log(10) lower than that for tobramycin. CONCLUSIONS: FTI is a broad-spectrum antibiotic combination with high activity in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest FTI could be a potential treatment for respiratory infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic bacteria.
TI  - Evolution of vertebrate glucokinase regulatory protein from a bacterial N-acetylmuramate 6-phosphate etherase.
AB  - Mammalian GKRP [GK (glucokinase) regulatory protein], a fructose 6-phosphate and  fructose 1-phosphate sensitive inhibitor of GK, appears to have resulted from the duplication of a gene similar to bacterial N-acetylmuramate 6-phosphate etherase MurQ. In the present study, we show that several genomes of primitive eukaryotes encode a GKRP-like protein with two MurQ repeats. Recombinant Haemophilus influenzae MurQ and the GKRP homologue of the amoeboflagellate Naegleria gruberi both behaved as excellent N-acetylmuramate 6-phosphate etherases, with Kcat values (83 and 20 s(-1)) at least as high as that reported for Escherichia coli MurQ. In contrast, rat and Xenopus GKRP displayed much lower etherase activities (Kcat=0.08 and 0.05 s(-1) respectively). The etherase activity of rat GKRP was inhibited by ligands (fructose 6-phosphate, fructose 1-phosphate and sorbitol 6-phosphate) known to regulate its interaction with GK and by mutations affecting the binding of these phosphate esters. This indicated that these phosphate esters all bind to a single regulatory site, which evolved from the original catalytic site. Sorbitol 6-phosphate and other phosphate esters also inhibited the etherase activity of Xenopus GKRP, but did not affect its ability to inhibit GK. Thus, unlike what was previously thought, Xenopus GKRP has a binding site for phosphate esters, but this site is uncoupled from the GK-binding site. Taken together, these data indicate that duplication of the murQ gene led to a eukaryotic-type etherase, which subsequently evolved to GKRP by acquiring a new binding specificity while losing most of its etherase activity.
TI  - Frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria isolated from 2 hospitals in Makkah, Saudi Arabia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of the gram-negative bacteria isolated from 2 hospitals in Makkah. METHODS: This study was undertaken in 2 main tertiary care hospitals namely; Al-Noor Specialist Hospital, and Hera Hospital in Makkah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from October 2005 to March 2006. A total of 1137 gram-negative bacteria were identified in non-duplicate clinical specimens obtained from 965 patients of various body sites infections. Demographic data, identity of microorganisms, and antimicrobial susceptibilities were obtained from medical and laboratory records. RESULTS: The most prevalent gram-negative bacteria were Escherichia coli (31.6%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (31.2%), followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (10.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.3%), Klebsiella sp. (6.2%), Haemophilus influenzae (3.7%), Proteus sp. (3.3%), and Enterobacter sp. (1.9%). Results demonstrated that gram-negative bacteria have a high rate of resistance to commonly used antibiotics. Furthermore, multi-drug resistance was also common in this study. CONCLUSION: Our data showed a high rate of resistance among gram-negative pathogens in comparison with other countries in the world. The implementation of monitoring programs is an important part of the prevention strategy against the development of antibiotic resistance in hospitals.
TI  - Crystal structures of bacterial FabH suggest a molecular basis for the substrate  specificity of the enzyme.
AB  - FabH (beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase III) is unique in that it initiates fatty acid biosynthesis, is inhibited by long-chain fatty acids providing means for feedback control of the process, and dictates the fatty acid profile of the organism by virtue of its substrate specificity. We report the crystal structures of bacterial FabH enzymes from four different pathogenic species: Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Structural data on the enzyme from different species show important differences in the architecture of the substrate-binding sites that parallel the inter-species diversity in the substrate specificities of these enzymes.
TI  - Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae protein E binds vitronectin and is important for serum resistance.
AB  - Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) commonly causes local disease in the upper and lower respiratory tract and has recently been shown to interfere with both the classical and alternative pathways of complement activation. The terminal pathway of the complement system is regulated by vitronectin that is a component of both plasma and the extracellular matrix. In this study, we identify protein E (PE; 16 kDa), which is a recently characterized ubiquitous outer membrane protein, as a vitronectin-binding protein of NTHi. A PE-deficient NTHi mutant had a markedly reduced survival in serum compared with the PE-expressing isogenic NTHi wild type. Moreover, the PE-deficient mutant showed a significantly decreased binding to both soluble and immobilized vitronectin. In parallel, PE-expressing Escherichia coli bound soluble vitronectin and adhered to immobilized vitronectin compared with controls. Surface plasmon resonance technology revealed a K(D) of 0.4 microM for the interaction between recombinant PE and immobilized vitronectin. Moreover, the PE-dependent vitronectin-binding site was located at the heparin-binding domains of vitronectin and the major vitronectin-binding domain was found in the central core of PE (aa 84-108). Importantly, vitronectin bound to the surface of NTHi 3655 reduced membrane attack complex-induced hemolysis. In contrast to incubation with normal human serum, NTHi 3655 showed a reduced survival in vitronectin-depleted human serum, thus demonstrating that vitronectin mediates a protective role at the bacterial surface. Our findings show that PE, by binding vitronectin, may play an important role in NTHi pathogenesis.
TI  - Secondary acylation of Vibrio cholerae lipopolysaccharide requires phosphorylation of Kdo.
AB  - The lipopolysaccharide of Vibrio cholerae has been reported to contain a single 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) residue that is phosphorylated. The phosphorylated Kdo sugar further links the hexa-acylated V. cholerae lipid A domain to the core oliogosaccharide and O-antigen. In this report, we confirm that V. cholerae possesses the enzymatic machinery to synthesize a phosphorylated Kdo residue. Further, we have determined that the presence of the phosphate group on the Kdo residue is necessary for secondary acylation in V. cholerae. The requirement for a secondary substituent on the Kdo residue (either an additional Kdo sugar or a phosphate group) was also found to be critical for secondary acylation catalyzed by LpxL proteins from Bordetella pertussis, Escherichia coli, and Haemophilus influenzae. Although three putative late acyltransferase orthologs have been identified in the V. cholerae genome (Vc0212, Vc0213, and Vc1577), only Vc0213 appears to be functional. Vc0213 functions as a myristoyl transferase acylating lipid A at the 2'-position of the glucosamine disaccharide. Generally acyl-ACPs serve as fatty acyl donors for the acyltransferases required for lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis; however, in vitro assays indicate that Vc0213 preferentially utilizes myristoyl-CoA as an acyl donor. This is the first report to biochemically characterize enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the V. cholerae Kdo-lipid A domain.
TI  - The bacteriology of salivary gland infections.
AB  - The parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. However, infection of the salivary glands can occur in any of the glands. The most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial infection are Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. The predominant anaerobes include: anaerobic Gram negative bacilli (eg, pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas); Fusobacterium spp; and Peptostreptococcus spp. In addition, Streptococcus spp (including Streptococcus pneumoniae) and aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacilli (including Escherichia coli) have been reported. Aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacilli are often seen in hospitalized patients. Organisms less frequently found are Haemophilus influenzae, Treponema pallidum, Bartonella henselae, and Eikenella corrodens. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of infection. The choice of antibiotics should be guided by identification of the etiologic agent.
TI  - DNA-binding by Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli YbaB, members of a widely-distributed bacterial protein family.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genes orthologous to the ybaB loci of Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae are widely distributed among eubacteria. Several years ago, the three-dimensional structures of the YbaB orthologs of both E. coli and H. influenzae were determined, revealing a novel "tweezer"-like structure. However, a function for YbaB had remained elusive, with an early study of the H. influenzae ortholog failing to detect DNA-binding activity. Our group recently determined that the Borrelia burgdorferi YbaB ortholog, EbfC, is a DNA-binding protein. To reconcile those results, we assessed the abilities of both the H. influenzae and E. coli YbaB proteins to bind DNA to which B. burgdorferi EbfC can bind. RESULTS: Both the H. influenzae and the E. coli YbaB proteins bound to tested DNAs. DNA-binding was not well competed with poly-dI-dC, indicating some sequence preferences for those two proteins. Analyses of binding characteristics determined that both YbaB orthologs bind as homodimers. Different DNA sequence preferences were observed between H. influenzae YbaB, E. coli YbaB and B. burgdorferi EbfC, consistent with amino acid differences in the putative DNA-binding domains of these proteins. CONCLUSION: Three distinct members of the YbaB/EbfC bacterial protein family have now been demonstrated to bind DNA. Members of this protein family are encoded by a broad range of bacteria, including many pathogenic species, and results of our studies suggest that all such proteins have DNA-binding activities. The functions of YbaB/EbfC family members in each bacterial species are as-yet unknown, but given the ubiquity of these DNA-binding proteins among Eubacteria, further investigations are warranted.
TI  - Sxy induces a CRP-S regulon in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Escherichia coli is not considered naturally competent, yet it has homologues of  the genes that most competent bacteria use for DNA uptake and processing. In Haemophilus influenzae and Vibrio cholerae, these genes are regulated by the Sxy and cyclic AMP receptor (CRP) proteins. We used microarrays to find out whether similar regulation occurs in E. coli. Expression of sxy strongly induced 63 transcriptional units, 34 of which required CRP for transcriptional activation and had promoter sites resembling the Sxy- and CRP-dependent CRP-S motif previously characterized in H. influenzae. As previously reported, sxy expression also induced the sigma-H regulon. Flagellar operons were downregulated by sxy expression, although motility remained unaffected. The CRP-S regulon included all of E. coli's known competence gene homologues, so we investigated Sxy's effect on competence-associated phenotypes. A sxy knockout reduced both "natural" plasmid transformation and competitive fitness in long-term culture. In addition, expression of plasmid-borne sxy led to production of type IV pilin, the main subunit of the DNA uptake machinery of most bacteria. Although H. influenzae Sxy only weakly activated the E. coli Sxy regulon, induction was dramatically improved when it was coexpressed with its cognate CRP, suggesting that intimate interactions between Sxy and CRP are required for transcriptional activation at CRP-S sites.
TI  - Lack of antimicrobial activity by the antiretroviral drug nevirapine against common bacterial pathogens.
AB  
TI  - Antibodies specific for the Hia adhesion proteins of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae mediate opsonophagocytic activity.
AB  - The Hia autotransporter proteins are highly immunogenic surface adhesins expressed by nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI). The objective of our study was to assess the opsonophagocytic activity of anti-Hia antibodies against homologous and heterologous NTHI. A segment of the hia gene that encodes a surface-exposed portion of the H. influenzae strain 11 Hia protein was cloned into a pGEMEX-2 expression vector. Escherichia coli JM101 was transformed with the resulting pGEMEX-Hia BstEII del recombinant plasmid, and recombinant fusion protein was recovered. An immune serum against recombinant GEMEX-Hia (rGEMEX-Hia)-mediated killing of the homologous NTHI strain 11 at a 1:160 titer and five heterologous Hia-expressing strains at titers of > or =1:40. Immune serum did not mediate killing of two Hia-knockout strains whose hia genes were inactivated but did mediate killing of one knockout strain at a high titer after the strain was transformed with a plasmid containing the hia gene. Immune serum did not mediate killing of HMW1/HMW2-expressing NTHI strains, which do not express the Hia adhesin. However, when two representative HMW1/HMW2-expressing strains were transformed with the plasmid containing the hia gene, they expressed abundant Hia and were susceptible to killing by the immune serum. Immune serum did not mediate killing of HMW1/HMW2-expressing strains transformed with the plasmid without the hia gene. Our results demonstrate that the Hia proteins of NTHI are targets of opsonophagocytic antibodies and that shared epitopes recognized by such antibodies are present on the Hia proteins of unrelated NTHI strains. These data argue for the continued investigation of the Hia proteins as vaccine candidates for the prevention of NTHI disease.
TI  - The impact of the stone age diet on gingival conditions in the absence of oral hygiene.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to assess the oral microbiota and clinical data in subjects without access to traditional oral hygiene methods and who ate a diet available in the Stone Age. METHODS: Ten subjects living in an environment replicating the Stone Age for 4 weeks were enrolled in this study. Bleeding on probing (BOP), gingival and plaque indices, and probing depth (PD) were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. Microbiologic samples were collected at the mesio-buccal subgingival aspects of all teeth and from the dorsum of the tongue and were processed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization methods. RESULTS: No subject had periodontitis. Mean BOP decreased from 34.8% to 12.6% (P <0.001). Mean gingival index scores changed from 0.38 to 0.43 (not statistically significant) and mean plaque scores increased from 0.68 to 1.47 (P <0.001). PD at sites of subgingival sampling decreased (mean difference: 0.2 mm; P <0.001). At week 4, the total bacterial count was higher (P <0.001) for 24 of 74 species, including Bacteroides ureolyticus, Eikenella corrodens, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Staphylococcus aureus (two strains), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus anginosis, and Streptococcus mitis. Bacterial counts from tongue samples were higher at baseline (P <0.001) for 20 species, including Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; serotype a), and Streptococcus spp. CONCLUSIONS: The experimental gingivitis protocol is not applicable if the diet (e.g., Stone Age) does not include refined sugars. Although plaque levels increased, BOP and PD decreased. Subgingival bacterial counts increased for several species not linked to periodontitis, whereas tongue bacterial samples decreased during the study period.
TI  - Rapid detection of eight causative pathogens for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis by real-time PCR.
AB  - We aimed to detect causative pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected from patients diagnosed with bacterial meningitis by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae described previously, five other pathogens, Neisseria meningitidis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes, were targeted, based on a large-scale surveillance in Japan. Results in CSF from neonates and children (n=150), and from adults (n=18) analyzed by real-time PCR with molecular beacon probes were compared with those of conventional culturing. The total time from DNA extraction from CSF to PCR analysis was 1.5 h. The limit of detection for these pathogens ranged from 5 copies to 28 copies per tube. Nonspecific positive reactions were not recognized for 37 microorganisms in clinical isolates as a negative control. The pathogens were detected in 72.0% of the samples by real-time PCR, but in only 48.2% by culture, although the microorganisms were completely concordant. With the real-time PCR, the detection rate of H. influenzae from CSF was high, at 45.2%, followed by S. pneumoniae (21.4%), S. agalactiae (2.4%), E. coli (1.8%), L. monocytogenes (0.6%), and M. pneumoniae (0.6%). The detection rate with PCR was significantly better than that with cultures in patients with antibiotic administration (chi2=18.3182; P=0.0000). In conclusion, detection with real-time PCR is useful for rapidly identifying the causative pathogens of meningitis and for examining the clinical course of chemotherapy.
TI  - Evolving concepts in biofilm infections.
AB  - Several pathogens associated with chronic infections, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae in chronic otitis media, Staphylococcus aureus in chronic rhinosinusitis and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli in recurrent urinary tract infections, are linked to biofilm formation. Biofilms are usually defined as surface-associated microbial communities, surrounded by an extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrix. Biofilm formation has been demonstrated for numerous pathogens and is clearly an important microbial survival strategy. However, outside of dental plaques, fewer reports have investigated biofilm development in clinical samples. Typically biofilms are found in chronic diseases that resist host immune responses and antibiotic treatment and these characteristics are often cited for the ability of bacteria to persist in vivo. This review examines some recent attempts to examine the biofilm phenotype in vivo and discusses the challenges and implications for defining a biofilm phenotype.
TI  - Early- and late-onset pneumonia: is this still a useful classification?
AB  - The choice of empirical treatment of nosocomial pneumonia in the intensive-care unit (ICU) used to rely on the interval after the start of mechanical ventilation. Nowadays, however, the question of whether in fact there is a difference in the distribution of causative pathogens is under debate. Data from 308 ICUs from the German National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System, including information on relevant pathogens isolated in 11,285 cases of nosocomial pneumonia from 1997 to 2004, were used for our evaluation. Each individual pneumonia case was allocated either to early- or to late-onset pneumonia, with three differentiation criteria: onset on the 4th day, the 5th day, or the 7th day in the ICU. The frequency of pathogens was evaluated according to these categories. A total of 5,066 additional cases of pneumonia were reported from 2005 to 2006, after the CDC criteria had been modified. From 1997 to 2004, the most frequent microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus (2,718 cases, including 720 with methicillin [meticillin]-resistant S. aureus), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1,837 cases), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,305 cases), Escherichia coli (1,137 cases), Enterobacter spp. (937 cases), streptococci (671 cases), Haemophilus influenzae (509 cases), Acinetobacter spp. (493 cases), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (308 cases). The order of the four most frequent pathogens (accounting for 53.7% of all pathogens) was the same in both groups and was independent of the cutoff categories applied: S. aureus was first, followed by P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and E. coli. Thus, the predictabilities of the occurrence of pathogens were similar for the earlier (1997-to-2004) and later (2005-to-2006) time frames. This classification is no longer helpful for empirical antibiotic therapy, since the pathogens are the same for both groups.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibility patterns of bacterial species isolated in outpatients of the Metropolitan Region, Chile, year 2007].
AB  - A partial surveillance of bacterial in vitro susceptibility to antibiotics, performed by a outpatient clinic, at Santiago, Chile, during year 2007, has yielded the following results: Staphylococcus aureus (n: 232) 3% of methicillin (oxacillin) resistance; Streptococcus pyogenes (n: 120) 6% of macrolides resistance; Haemophilus influenzae nt (n: 60) 12% of ampicillin and 3% of chloramphenicol resistance; Neisseria gonorrhoeae (n: 170): 78% of penicillin, 56% of tetracyclin and 32% of ciprofloxacin resistance; Escherichia coli obtained from urine: (adults n: 3.066, children n: 260) 27-28% of sulpha-trimethoprim resistance, 15% (children) -21 % (adults) of cefadroxil resistance.
TI  - [Conservation of the regulatory elements implicated in the control of the rpsB-tsf operon expression in gamma-proteobacteria].
AB  - In eubacteria, the rpsB-tsf operon encodes two essential components of translational apparatus, ribosomal protein (r-protein) S2 and elongation factor Ts. Recently, we located the promoter region of the Escherichia coli rpsB-tsf operon and demonstrated that both rpsB and tsf genes are negatively regulated by r-protein S2 at the translational level. In this paper, we present data of phylogenetic analysis showing high conservation of both the promoter signature and the structure of the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of the rpsB mRNA in gamma-proteobacteria. Despite the difference in length and overall primary structure of the rpsB 5'-UTRs for various representatives of this bacterial phylum, several short regions within the 5'-UTRs appeared to be universally conserved, implying their participation in the expression regulation. Phylogenetic predictions have been experimentally confirmed. We show here that the presumable rpsB promoter regions from Yersinia pestis, Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are able to drive transcription of the lacZ -reporter in E. coli and that the corresponding rpsB 5'-UTRs are subjected to autogenous repression by r-protein S2 in vivo.
TI  - Structure of the diaminopimelate epimerase DapF from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
AB  - The meso (or D,L) isomer of diaminopimelic acid (DAP), a precursor of L-lysine, is a key component of the pentapeptide linker in bacterial peptidoglycan. While the peptidoglycan incorporated in the highly complex cell wall of the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis structurally resembles that of Escherichia coli, it is unique in that it can contain penicillin-resistant meso-DAP-->meso-DAP linkages. The interconversion of L,L-DAP and meso-DAP is catalysed by the DAP epimerase DapF, a gene product that is essential in M. tuberculosis. Here, the crystal structure of the ligand-free form of M. tuberculosis DapF (MtDapF) refined to a resolution of 2.6 A is reported. MtDapF shows small if distinct deviations in secondary structure from the two-domain alpha/beta-fold of the known structures of Haemophilus influenzae DapF and Bacillus anthracis DapF, which are in line with its low sequence identity (<or=27%) to the former. Modelling the present structure onto that of L,L-aziridino-DAP-bound H. influenzae DapF illustrates that a rigid-body movement of domain II and a rearrangement of the B4-A2 loop (residues 80-90) of domain I are likely to accompany the transition from the present inactive form to a catalytically competent enzyme. Despite a highly conserved active-site architecture, the model indicates that stabilization of the DAP backbone occurs in MtDapF through a tyrosine residue that is specific to mycobacterial DAP epimerases.
TI  - HadA is an atypical new multifunctional trimeric coiled-coil adhesin of Haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegyptius, which promotes entry into host cells.
AB  - The Oca (Oligomeric coiled-coil adhesin) family is a subgroup of the bacterial trimeric autotransporter adhesins, which includes structurally related proteins, such as YadA of Yersinia enterocolitica and NadA of Neisseria meningitidis. In this study, we searched in silico for novel members of this family in bacterial genomes and identified HadA (Haemophilus adhesin A), a trimeric autotransporter expressed only by Haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegyptius causing Brazilian purpuric fever (BPF), a fulminant septicemic disease of children. By comparative genomics and sequence analysis we predicted that the hadA gene is harboured on a mobile genetic element unique to BPF isolates. Biological analysis of HadA in the native background was limited because this organism is not amenable to genetic manipulation. Alternatively, we demonstrated that expression of HadA confers to a non-invasive Escherichia coli strain the ability to adhere to human cells and to extracellular matrix proteins and to induce in vitro bacterial aggregation and microcolony formation. Intriguingly, HadA is predicted to lack the typical N-terminal head domain of Oca proteins generally associated with cellular receptor binding. We propose here a structural model of the HadA coiled-coil stalk and show that the N-terminal region is still responsible of the binding activity and a KGD motif plays a role. Interestingly, HadA promotes bacterial entry into mammalian cells. Our results show a cytoskeleton re-arrangement and an involvement of clathrin in the HadA-mediated internalization. These data give new insights on the structure-function relationship of oligomeric coiled-coil adhesins and suggest a potential role of this protein in the pathogenesis of BPF.
TI  - Community-acquired bacterial meningitis in elderly patients: experience over 30 years.
AB  - Clinical characteristics, etiologies, evolution, and prognostic factors of community-acquired bacterial meningitis in elderly patients are not well known. To improve this knowledge, all episodes of community-acquired bacterial meningitis were prospectively recorded and cases occurring in patients >or=65 years old were selected. During the period 1977-2006, 675 episodes in adults (aged >or=18 yr) were recorded, with 185 (27%) in patients aged >or=65 years old; 76 were male and 109 were female, with a mean age of 73 +/- 6 years (range, 65-93 yr). Causative microorganisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae 74, Neisseria meningitidis 49, Listeria monocytogenes 17, other streptococcal 9, Escherichia coli 6, Haemophilus influenzae 4, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus 2 each, Capnocytophaga canimorsus and Enterococcus faecalis 1 each, and unknown in 20. On admission 91% had had fever, 32% were in a coma (Glasgow Coma Scale <or=8), 9% presented with seizures, and 8% with shock. Thirty patients (16%) presented with seizures during therapy. Mortality was 58/185 (31%). Compared with patients aged 18-65 years, there were significant differences among older patients (aged >or=65 yr), who showed a higher frequency of diabetes and malignancy as underlying disease; pneumonia, otitis, and pericranial fistula as predisposing factors; and S. pneumoniae and L. monocytogenes as etiology. There were also differences in clinical presentation, complications, sequelae, and mortality. Factors independently related with mortality were age, pneumonia as a predisposing factor, coma on admission, and heart failure and seizures after therapy. Dexamethasone therapy was a protective factor. In conclusion, bacterial meningitis in elderly patients is associated with greater diagnostic difficulties and neurologic severity and more complications, as well as with increased mortality. Antiseizure prophylaxis might be useful in these patients.
TI  - Invasive pneumococcal disease in children aged <5 years admitted to 3 urban hospitals in Ibadan, Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae remains a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in the world. The introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in developing countries will be facilitated by a clearer understanding of the disease burden for bacterial causes of pneumonia and meningitis and the prevalent serotypes of S. pneumoniae. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, hospital-based surveillance for a 2-year period involving children aged 2-59 months at 3 urban hospitals in Ibadan, Nigeria, using standard microbiological methods with confirmation and further testing of isolates at the Medical Research Council Laboratories in The Gambia. RESULTS: There were 1210 cases overall: 481 (39.8%) were meningitis, 399 (33.0%) were pneumonia, and 330 (27.2%) were bacteremia clinical syndromes. There were 24 cases of definite meningitis, of which 9 were caused by S. pneumoniae, 11 by Haemophilus influenzae type b, and 4 by Klebsiella species. Of the 90 culture-positive pneumonia cases, 9 were caused by S. pneumoniae, 2 by H. influenzae type b, and 79 by other species. Among cases of bacteremia, the pathogen isolation rate was 28.8% (95 of 330); the isolated species included S. pneumoniae (3 isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (20 isolates), Klebsiella species (13 isolates), Salmonella species (15 isolates), and Escherichia coli (6 isolates). Of the 23 S. pneumoniae isolates, 11 were serotyped; the serotypes found were 5 (5 isolates), 19F (3 isolates), and 4 (3 isolates), and 1 isolate was nontypeable. These isolates were all susceptible to penicillin. Eight of 9 patients with definite pneumococcal meningitis died, whereas all patients with pneumococcal pneumonia and septicemia survived. CONCLUSIONS: Of the pneumococcal serotypes identified, 55% were covered by the licensed 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, whereas all are covered by the 10- and 13-valent vaccines.
TI  - Molecular cloning and expression of a novel cholinephosphotransferase involved in glycoglycerophospholipid biosynthesis of Mycoplasma fermentans.
AB  - A gene, mf1, encoding a novel cholinephosphotransferase in glycoglycerophospholipid (GGPL) biosynthesis of Mycoplasma fermentans PG18 was identified by genomic analysis, cloned, and expressed in Escherichia coli. The mf1 gene comprises an open reading frame of 777 bp encoding 258 amino acids. The mf1 gene product, Mf1, has 23% amino acid homology with LicD of Haemophilus influenzae but no homology with genes of other Mycoplasma species in the GenBank database. The reaction product of Mf1 using alpha-glucopyranosyl-1,2-dipalmitoilglycerol and cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine (CDP-choline) as substrates showed the specific protonated molecule at m/z 896, which corresponded to GGPL-I as determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Furthermore, the product ions of choline, phosphocholine, and hexose-bound phosphocholine were detected by tandem mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of protonated molecules at m/z 896. These results identified mf1 as a novel cholinephosphotransferase and showed that the phosphocholine transfer step is involved in the GGPL biosynthesis pathway of M. fermentans. This is the first report of a GGPL biosynthesis enzyme.
TI  - Structural studies of the Enterococcus faecalis SufU [Fe-S] cluster protein.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron-sulfur clusters are ubiquitous and evolutionarily ancient inorganic prosthetic groups, the biosynthesis of which depends on complex protein machineries. Three distinct assembly systems involved in the maturation of cellular Fe-S proteins have been determined, designated the NIF, ISC and SUF systems. Although well described in several organisms, these machineries are poorly understood in Gram-positive bacteria. Within the Firmicutes phylum, the Enterococcus spp. genus have recently assumed importance in clinical microbiology being considered as emerging pathogens for humans, wherein Enterococcus faecalis represents the major species associated with nosocomial infections. The aim of this study was to carry out a phylogenetic analysis in Enterococcus faecalis V583 and a structural and conformational characterisation of it SufU protein. RESULTS: BLAST searches of the Enterococcus genome revealed a series of genes with sequence similarity to the Escherichia coli SUF machinery of [Fe-S] cluster biosynthesis, namely sufB, sufC, sufD and SufS. In addition, the E. coli IscU ortholog SufU was found to be the scaffold protein of Enterococcus spp., containing all features considered essential for its biological activity, including conserved amino acid residues involved in substrate and/or co-factor binding (Cys50,76,138 and Asp52) and, phylogenetic analyses showed a close relationship with orthologues from other Gram-positive bacteria. Molecular dynamics for structural determinations and molecular modeling using E. faecalis SufU primary sequence protein over the PDB:1su0 crystallographic model from Streptococcus pyogenes were carried out with a subsequent 50 ns molecular dynamic trajectory. This presented a stable model, showing secondary structure modifications near the active site and conserved cysteine residues. Molecular modeling using Haemophilus influenzae IscU primary sequence over the PDB:1su0 crystal followed by a MD trajectory was performed to analyse differences in the C-terminus region of Gram-positive SufU and Gram-negative orthologous proteins, in which several modifications in secondary structure were observed. CONCLUSION: The data describe the identification of the SUF machinery for [Fe-S] cluster biosynthesis present in the Firmicutes genome, showing conserved sufB, sufC, sufD and sufS genes and the presence of the sufU gene coding for scaffold protein, instead of sufA; neither sufE nor sufR are present. Primary sequences and structural analysis of the SufU protein demonstrated its structural-like pattern to the scaffold protein IscU nearby on the ISC machinery. E. faecalis SufU molecular modeling showed high flexibility over the active site regions, and demonstrated the existence of a specific region in Firmicutes denoting the Gram positive region (GPR), suggested as a possible candidate for interaction with other factors and/or regulators.
TI  - Community-acquired bacteremia among children admitted to a rural hospital in Mozambique.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although community-acquired bacteremia is an important cause of childhood mortality in Africa, recognition of disease burden and potential impact of bacterial vaccines is limited. METHODS: Blood cultures for bacterial pathogens were conducted systematically among children <15 years of age admitted to Manhica District Hospital, from 2001 to 2006. RESULTS: Blood-stream infections were identified in 8% (1550/19,896) of pediatric hospital admissions. Nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) and Pneumococcus were the most prevalent pathogens isolated (26% and 25% of 1550 cases, respectively). Until 28 days of life, Staphylococcus aureus (39%) and group B Streptococcus (20%) predominated. Incidence of community-acquired bacteremia per 100,000 child-years was 1730/10 in children <1 year old, 782/10 in 1-4 year oldd, and 49/10 in children 5 years and older. Case-fatality of bacteremia was 12%. Community-acquired bacteremia associated mortality accounted for 21% (162/788) of hospital deaths. Resistance to antibiotics commonly used in Mozambique was high among invasive isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and NTS. CONCLUSIONS: Community-acquired bacteremia is an important cause of pediatric hospital admission and death in rural African hospitals. The high burden of disease, mortality, and pattern of antibiotic resistance associated with bacteremia underscore the need for prevention in Sub-Saharan Africa.
TI  - Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae adhesin protein E: characterization and biological activity.
AB  - The adhesin protein E (PE) of the human respiratory pathogen nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) exists in all clinical isolates. In the present study, NTHi adherence to epithelial cells of various origins was further analyzed. The number of intraepithelial PE-deficient NTHi was decreased compared with PE-expressing NTHi. Interestingly, PE-expressing NTHi or Escherichia coli transformants, in addition to soluble recombinant PE22-160 without a lipid moiety, induced a proinflammatory cell response. The adhesive PE domain was defined within PE84-108, and preincubation of epithelial cells with this peptide blocked adhesion of several clinical NTHi isolates. Mice immunized with PE84-108 cleared NTHi up to 8-fold more efficiently on pulmonary challenge than did mice immunized with a control peptide. Finally, anti-PE mouse antibodies from vaccinated mice prevented NTHi adhesion. Our data suggest that the ubiquitous adhesin PE plays an important role in the pathogenesis of NTHi infection.
TI  - Distinct gate conformations of the ABC transporter BtuCD revealed by electron spin resonance spectroscopy and chemical cross-linking.
AB  - BtuCD is a type II ABC importer that catalyzes the translocation of vitamin B12 from the periplasm into the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli. Crystal structures of BtuCD and the related HiF (or Hi1470/71) protein from Haemophilus influenzae have revealed distinct conformations of the transmembrane domains that form inner and outer gates. We used electron spin resonance spectroscopy to study the reaction cycle of BtuCD after labeling the protein at residues located at these gates. The results suggest that BtuCD as a prototype type II ABC importer may have a mechanism that is distinct from that of ABC exporters such as Sav1866 or type I ABC importers such as those specific for molybdate (ModBC) or maltose (MalFGK).
TI  - [Bacterial etiology of pneumonia in hospitalized children: combined detection with culture and polymerase chain reaction].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacterial cultures from respiratory aspirate or sputum have been the conventional diagnostic method for pneumonia, but the results of culture was often affected by early extensive use of antibiotics, sample collection and delivery. The objective of this study was to explore application of the combined detection of culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in hospitalized children with pneumonia. METHODS: Totally 187 hospitalized children with pneumonia were enrolled. The age of the patients ranged from 1 month to 10 years, 124 were male, 63 female; 175 of the patients received antibiotics treatment before admission. Deep respiratory aspirate sample from patients was cultured by Streptococcus pneumoniae selective plate, Hemophilus influenzae selective plate and conventional plate. The aspirate samples were also amplified for DNA of 14 bacteria with target enriched multiplex polymerase chain reaction (Tem-PCR) and detected with Luminex xMAP technology platform. RESULTS: The total positive rate by bacterial culture was 40.1% (75/187), of which 17.1% (24/187) were Hemophilus influenzae b, 8.6% (16/187) were Escherichia coli, 6.4% (12/187) were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 4.8% (9/187) were Staphylococcus aureus, 3.7% (7/187) were Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1.6% (3/187) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1.1% (2/187) were Acinetobacter baumannii, and 1.1% (2/187) were Enterobacter cloacae. The total positive rate by combined detection of culture and Tem-PCR assay were 78.6% (147/187), of which 28.9% (54/187) were Hemophilus influenzae b, 19.3% (36/187) were Streptococcus pneumoniae, 8.6% (16/187) were Escherichia coli, 6.4% (12/187) were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 5.9% (11/187) were Staphylococcus aureus, 5.9% (11/187) were Acinetobacter baumannii, 2.7% (5/187) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 1.1% (2/187) were Enterobacter cloacae. CONCLUSION: The Tem-PCR assay may increase the detection rate of Hemophilus influenzae b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. The Combined detection may increase the positive rate of bacterial pathogens in hospitalized children with pneumonia, and the results might reflect the real patterns of bacterial etiology. The Tem-PCR needs further improvement for diagnosis of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - Orchestration of Haemophilus influenzae RecJ exonuclease by interaction with single-stranded DNA-binding protein.
AB  - RecJ exonuclease plays crucial roles in several DNA repair and recombination pathways, and its ubiquity in bacterial species points to its ancient origin and vital cellular function. RecJ exonuclease from Haemophilus influenzae is a 575-amino-acid protein that harbors the characteristic motifs conserved among RecJ homologs. The purified protein exhibits a processive 5'-3' single-stranded-DNA-specific exonuclease activity. The exonuclease activity of H. influenzae RecJ (HiRecJ) was supported by Mg(2+) or Mn(2+) and inhibited by Cd(2+), suggesting a different mode of metal binding in HiRecJ as compared to Escherichia coli RecJ (EcoRecJ). Site-directed mutagenesis of highly conserved residues in HiRecJ abolished enzymatic activity. Interestingly, substitution of alanine for aspartate 77 resulted in a catalytically inactive enzyme that bound to DNA with a significantly higher affinity as compared to the wild-type enzyme. Noticeably, steady-state kinetic studies showed that H. influenzae single-stranded DNA-binding protein (HiSSB) increased the affinity of HiRecJ for single-stranded DNA and stimulated its exonuclease activity. HiSSB, whose C-terminal tail had been deleted, failed to enhance RecJ exonuclease activity. More importantly, HiRecJ was found to directly associate with its cognate single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB), as demonstrated by various in vitro assays. Interaction studies carried out with the truncated variants of HiRecJ and HiSSB revealed that the two proteins interact via the C-terminus of SSB protein and the core-catalytic domain of RecJ. Taken together, these results emphasize direct interaction between RecJ and SSB, which confers functional cooperativity to these two proteins. In addition, these results implicate SSB as being involved in the recruitment of RecJ to DNA and provide insights into the interplay between these proteins in repair and recombination pathways.
TI  - Buffering by gene duplicates: an analysis of molecular correlates and evolutionary conservation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: One mechanism to account for robustness against gene knockouts or knockdowns is through buffering by gene duplicates, but the extent and general correlates of this process in organisms is still a matter of debate. To reveal general trends of this process, we provide a comprehensive comparison of gene essentiality, duplication and buffering by duplicates across seven bacteria (Mycoplasma genitalium, Bacillus subtilis, Helicobacter pylori, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli), and four eukaryotes (Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), Caenorhabditis elegans (worm), Drosophila melanogaster (fly), Mus musculus (mouse)). RESULTS: In nine of the eleven organisms, duplicates significantly increase chances of survival upon gene deletion (P-value < or = 0.05), but only by up to 13%. Given that duplicates make up to 80% of eukaryotic genomes, the small contribution is surprising and points to dominant roles of other buffering processes, such as alternative metabolic pathways. The buffering capacity of duplicates appears to be independent of the degree of gene essentiality and tends to be higher for genes with high expression levels. For example, buffering capacity increases to 23% amongst highly expressed genes in E. coli. Sequence similarity and the number of duplicates per gene are weak predictors of the duplicate's buffering capacity. In a case study we show that buffering gene duplicates in yeast and worm are somewhat more similar in their functions than non-buffering duplicates and have increased transcriptional and translational activity. CONCLUSION: In sum, the extent of gene essentiality and buffering by duplicates is not conserved across organisms and does not correlate with the organisms' apparent complexity. This heterogeneity goes beyond what would be expected from differences in experimental approaches alone. Buffering by duplicates contributes to robustness in several organisms, but to a small extent--and the relatively large amount of buffering by duplicates observed in yeast and worm may be largely specific to these organisms. Thus, the only common factor of buffering by duplicates between different organisms may be the by-product of duplicate retention due to demands of high dosage.
TI  - Postantibiotic effect of tigecycline against 14 gram-positive organisms.
AB  - The in vitro postantibiotic effects (PAEs), postantibiotic sub-MIC effects (PA-SMEs), and sub-MIC effects of tigecycline were determined for 14 gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. The pneumococcal, staphylococcal, and enterococcal PAEs were 1.9 to 5.1, 2.9 to 5.7, and 3.9 to 6.1 h, respectively, and those for Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Acinetobacter baumannii were 1.1 to 5.0, 1.9 to 2.1, 1.7 to 1.8, 1.0 to 1.7, and 0.7 to 3 h, respectively. The PA-SMEs (four times the MIC) ranged from 6.7 to >11 h for gram-positive organisms and from 2.3 to >11.3 h for gram-negative organisms.
TI  - The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of meropenem in the cerebrospinal fluid of neurosurgical patients.
AB  - This study examined the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of meropenem in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Meropenem (0.5 g every 8 h) was administered by 0.5-h infusion to six neurosurgical patients. Lumbar CSF and venous blood samples were obtained at 0.5-16 h after the start of the first infusion. Drug concentrations in the CSF and plasma were analyzed pharmacokinetically and used for a Monte Carlo simulation with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data of clinical isolates in Japan. Meropenem penetrated into the CSF with the area under the drug concentration-time curve ratio of 0.10 +/- 0.03 (mean +/- SD) and the repeated infusions caused the drug concentration in the CSF to accumulate slightly. Against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Escherichia coli isolates, 0.5 g q8h achieved a >90% probability of pharmacodynamic target (50% of the time above MIC) attainment, and 1 g q8h was needed for a >90% probability of target (100% of the time above MIC) attainment. However, against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2 g q8h achieved a lower probability of target attainment. These results should help us to better elucidate the pharmacokinetics of meropenem in the cerebrospinal space while also helping us to choose the appropriate drug dosages for the management of bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of cefditoren against major community-acquired respiratory pathogens recently isolated in Italy.
AB  - In this study we evaluated the in vitro activities of cefditoren--a broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin--and other comparator agents against 2,396 fresh isolates from community-acquired respiratory tract infections, collected from 6 clinical Italian microbiology laboratories. On penicillin-susceptible pneumococci and Streptococcus pyogenes, cefditoren demonstrated to be the most active antibiotic (MIC(90)values of 0.03 and 0.06 mg/L respectively), showing only a slight decrease in potency on penicillin-intermediate and resistant pneumococci (MIC(90)value 0.5 mg/L, 1.0 mg/L respectively). All the other comparators displayed MIC(90 )values of 4 - 8 mg/L for penicillins and of 4 to >64 mg/L for the oral cephalosporins. Cefditoren and levofloxacin were the most active against MSSA (MIC(90)0.5 mg/mL). Cefditoren displayed a uniformly potent inhibitory activity (MIC(90)of 0.03 mg/L) against all strains of Haemophilus influenzae, regardless of their ampicillin resistance (mediated or not by beta-lactamase production), while against Moraxella catarrhalis MIC(90)values were higher against beta-lactamase-positive (0.25 mg/L). Cefditoren was active also against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli : in this case its activity was comparable with that of levofloxacin. In conclusion, cefditoren, due to its potent activity, is a new effective therapeutic option for the treatment of respiratory tract infections.
TI  - [Nationwide susceptibility surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antimicrobials against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--third ciproxan injection special survey (2005)].
AB  - We conducted 3 nationwide surveillance studies between 2001 and 2005 at 39 participating institutions throughout Japan according to the special survey plan to investigate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and various parenteral antimicrobials using clinical isolates from patients with severe infection during the reexamination period of parenteral CPFX. Results of the first special survey (2001) were already reported in this journal. The current third special survey (2005) was conducted at 34 participating institutions throughout Japan to determine susceptibility to CPFX and 22 various parenteral antimicrobials with the use of the microdilution method with respect to 1696 strains isolated and identified from various clinical specimens between January and June 2005. The results of CPFX in this survey were compared with those in the first and second special surveys. The minimum inhibitory concentration of CPFX at which 90% of isolates were susceptible (MIC90) ranged from < or =0.063 to 2 microg/mL for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., Serratia marcescens, and Acinetobacter baumannii, revealing no marked change from results of the first and second surveys. However, the CPFX-susceptibility rate of Escherichia coli decreased in the second and third surveys compared to that in the first survey. For Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MIC90 of CPFX tended to increase with time. The CPFX-susceptibility rates calculated from the pneumonia breakpoint were 85.2% for P. aeruginosa and 67.9% for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. With the exception of these 2 species, major causative organisms of respiratory tract infection had susceptibility rates as high as 90% or more for CPFX, which were similar to results of the first and second special surveys. These susceptibility rates for CPFX were similar to the rates for cefozopran and imipenem. These values generally indicated favorable CPFX susceptibility testing results of major bacteria and the potent antimicrobial activity of CPFX particularly against Gram-negative bacteria. Further surveillance is required regarding the trend in susceptibility of E. coli, M. morganii, and P. aeruginosa, which tended to become less susceptible with time.
TI  - Transforming DNA uptake gene orthologs do not mediate spontaneous plasmid transformation in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Spontaneous plasmid transformation of Escherichia coli occurs on nutrient-containing agar plates. E. coli has also been reported to use double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) as a carbon source. The mechanism(s) of entry of exogenous dsDNA that allows plasmid establishment or the use of DNA as a nutrient remain(s) unknown. To further characterize plasmid transformation, we first documented the stimulation of transformation by agar and agarose. We provide evidence that stimulation is not due to agar contributing a supplement of Ca(2+), Fe(2+), Mg(2+), Mn(2+), or Zn(2+). Second, we undertook to inactivate the E. coli orthologues of Haemophilus influenzae components of the transformation machine that allows the uptake of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) from exogenous dsDNA. The putative outer membrane channel protein (HofQ), transformation pseudopilus component (PpdD), and transmembrane pore (YcaI) are not required for plasmid transformation. We conclude that plasmid DNA does not enter E. coli cells as ssDNA. The finding that purified plasmid monomers transform E. coli with single-hit kinetics supports this conclusion; it establishes that a unique monomer molecule is sufficient to give rise to a transformant, which is not consistent with the reconstitution of an intact replicon through annealing of partially overlapping complementary ssDNA, taken up from two independent monomers. We therefore propose that plasmid transformation involves internalization of intact dsDNA molecules. Our data together, with previous reports that HofQ is required for the use of dsDNA as a carbon source, suggest the existence of two routes for DNA entry, at least across the outer membrane of E. coli.
TI  - Constructing large DNA segments by iterative clone recombination.
AB  - Methods for constructing large contiguous segments of DNA will be enabling for Synthetic Biology, where the assembly of genes encoding circuits, biosynthetic pathways or even whole microbial organisms is of interest. Currently, in vitro approaches to DNA synthesis are adequate for generating DNAs that are up to 10s of kbp in length, and in vivo recombination strategies are more suitable for building DNA constructs that are 100 kbp or larger. We have developed a vector system for efficient assembly of large DNA molecules by iterative in vivo recombination of fosmid clones. Two custom fosmid vectors have been built, pFOSAMP and pFOSKAN, that support antibiotic switching. Using this technique we rebuilt two non-contiguous regions of the Haemophilus influenzae genome as episomes in recombinogenic Escherichia coli host cells. These regions together comprise190 kbp, or 10.4% of the H. influenze genome.
TI  - Using shotgun sequence data to find active restriction enzyme genes.
AB  - Whole genome shotgun sequence analysis has become the standard method for beginning to determine a genome sequence. The preparation of the shotgun sequence clones is, in fact, a biological experiment. It determines which segments of the genome can be cloned into Escherichia coli and which cannot. By analyzing the complete set of sequences from such an experiment, it is possible to identify genes lethal to E. coli. Among this set are genes encoding restriction enzymes which, when active in E. coli, lead to cell death by cleaving the E. coli genome at the restriction enzyme recognition sites. By analyzing shotgun sequence data sets we show that this is a reliable method to detect active restriction enzyme genes in newly sequenced genomes, thereby facilitating functional annotation. Active restriction enzyme genes have been identified, and their activity demonstrated biochemically, in the sequenced genomes of Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, Bacillus cereus ATCC 10987 and Methylococcus capsulatus.
TI  - Pattern classification of phylogeny signals.
AB  - In this paper we propose the minimum entropy clustering (MEC) method for clustering genes based on their phylogenetic signals. This entropy based method will cluster two genes together when their concatenation can decrease the entropy. An integral feature of MEC is that it chooses the number of clusters automatically, which is a major advantage over the other methods. Our simulation results show that this method is quite successful in clustering genes with a common phylogeny.
TI  - Cyclic peptides from Oldenlandia affinis DC. Molecular and biological properties.
AB  - A new isolation procedure for Kalata polypeptides from the tropical plant Oldenlandia affinis DC is described. Fractions were screened by thin-layer chromatography, and Van Urk positive fractions were tested for oxytocic activity in estrogenized rat uteri. By using this procedure, we were able to isolate and characterize three macrocyclic polypeptides with uterine activity. Their amino acid sequence and biological effects have been analyzed, and their NMR spectra were compared with those of the earlier ones. All three peptides showed hemolytic activity on human blood, and were tested for antibiotic effect against E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Hemophilus influenzae.
TI  - Design at the atomic level: generation of novel hybrid biaryloxazolidinones as promising new antibiotics.
AB  - From the X-ray crystal structures of linezolid and the non-selective antibiotic sparsomycin, we have derived a new family of hybrid oxazolidinones. From this initial compound set we have developed a new biaryloxazolidinone scaffold that shows both potent antimicrobial activity as well as selective inhibition of ribosomal translation. The synthesis of these compounds is outlined.
TI  - [Distribution and drug resistance of the isolated bacteria from children with acute respiratory infection].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the distribution and drug resistance of the isolated bacteria from children with acute respiratory infection (ARI) in Dalian. METHODS: Between January 2006 and February 2007, 930 children with ARI were enrolled, including 364 with acute upper respiratory infection (AURI), and 566 with acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI). The AURI children, who did not receive antimicrobial agent treatment or received oral antimicrobial agents 1-2 times, had bacterial cultures of pharyngeal swab. The ALRI children, who received intravenous antibacterial agents more than 3 days, had bacterial cultures of sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Isolated bacteria were identified by the ATB system (Bio-Merieux, France). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out by means of Kirby-bauer. RESULTS: A total of 404 isolates (43.4%) were identified. Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 22.5%, 12.1% and 7.4% respectively. In the isolates from AURI, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 43.9%, 22.0% and 9.1% respectively; Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia and Nonfermenters accounted for 4.5%, 8.3% and 3.0% respectively. In the isolates from ALRI, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 12.1%, 7.4% and 6.6% respectively; Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Nonfermenters accounted for 16.9%, 13.2% and 21.8% respectively. The resistant rates of Haemophilus to ampicillin and TMP-SMZ were 29.3% and 32.9% respectively, and to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefalotin, cefaclor, cefuroxime and cefotaxime were 12.1%, 10.0%, 10.0%, 11.4% and 5.7%, respectively. The resistant rate of Haemophilus to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefaclor, tetracycine and TMP-SMZ in the ALRI group were significantly higher than that in the AURI group (P<0.05 or 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In Dalian, Haemophilus was the main isolate of children with ARI. The distribution of bacteria was different between ALRI and AURI. In ALRI, Gram-negative bacilli were in a higher proportion, and the resistant rates of Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefaclor were higher.
TI  - Childhood bacterial meningitis in Ibadan, Nigeria--antibiotic sensitivity pattern of pathogens, prognostic indices and outcome.
AB  - Bacterial meningitis remains a major cause of morbidity, mortality and neurodisability in childhood, particularly in the developing world where effective vaccines against the usual pathogens responsible for the disease are not in routine use. To describe the patterns and outcome of bacterial meningitis among children admitted into the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan, Nigeria. All children who satisfied the case definition for meningitis, admitted into the paediatric wards of the University College Hospital, UCH, Ibadan over a period of 30 months were prospectively enrolled and blood and CSF samples were taken for bacteriological analyses. A total of 97 children, 62 males and 35 females were studied. Their ages ranged between 2 months and 12 years, mean age 33.0 (SD=41.7) months, with 80.4% of the cases below the age of 5 years. Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) was the leading pathogen, found in 16 (55.1%) of the 29 cases of definite meningitis. Other isolates include Streptococcus pneumoniae (24.1%), Klebsiella spp (7.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (7.0%), Escherichia coli (3.4%) and Pseudomonas spp. (3.4%). Hib and pneumococcus showed varying degrees of resistance to chloramphenicol, penicillin and cotrimoxazole. Twenty six (26.8%) of the cases died and 67.6% of the survivors developed significant neurological sequele. Bacterial meningitis remains a major cause of childhood mortality and neurodisability. Hib and pneumococcus remain the major pathogens responsible for this dreadful disease in Ibadan, Nigeria. The increasing emergence of antibiotic resistance calls for institution of adequate control measures, particularly routine childhood immunisation against the disease.
TI  - CRP binding and transcription activation at CRP-S sites.
AB  - In Haemophilus influenzae, as in Escherichia coli, the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) activates transcription from hundreds of promoters by binding symmetrical DNA sites with the consensus half-site 5'-A(1)A(2)A(3)T(4)G(5)T(6)G(7)A(8)T(9)C(10)T(11). We have previously identified 13 H. influenzae CRP sites that differ from canonical (CRP-N) sites in the following features: (1) Both half-sites of these noncanonical (CRP-S) sites have C(6) instead of T(6), although they otherwise have an unusually high level of identity with the binding site consensus. (2) Only promoters with CRP-S sites require both the CRP and Sxy proteins for transcription activation. To study the functional significance of CRP-S site sequences, we purified H. influenzae (Hi)CRP and compared its DNA binding properties to those of the well-characterized E. coli (Ec)CRP. All EcCRP residues that contact DNA are conserved in HiCRP, and both proteins demonstrated a similar high affinity for the CRP-N consensus sequence. However, whereas EcCRP bound specifically to CRP-S sites in vitro, HiCRP did not. By systematically substituting base pairs in native promoters and in the CRP-N consensus sequence, we confirmed that HiCRP is highly specific for the perfect core sequence T(4)G(5)T(6)G(7)A(8) and is more selective than EcCRP at other positions in CRP sites. Even though converting C(6)-->T(6) greatly enhanced HiCRP binding to a CRP-S site, this had the unexpected effect of nearly abolishing promoter activity. A+T-rich sequences upstream of CRP-S sites were also found to be required for promoter activation, raising the possibility that Sxy binds these A+T sequences to simultaneously enable CRP-DNA binding and assist in RNA polymerase recruitment.
TI  - The relationship between undernutrition and humoral immune status in children with pneumonia in Papua New Guinea.
AB  - Malnutrition is a significant risk factor for childhood infectious diseases in developing countries, including Papua New Guinea (PNG). Whilst the mechanisms are not fully understood there is little doubt that impairment of immune function is a major contributing factor in enhancing disease susceptibility in malnourished children. This susceptibility has been clearly shown for pneumonia in PNG. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of undernutrition on the humoral immune profile in children less than 60 months of age with pneumonia. The study was cross-sectional with measurements of nutritional status and parameters of the immune response being assessed simultaneously. The children were grouped according to age for the purpose of comparative analysis. The children were from the Goroka region of the Eastern Highlands Province of PNG and had been admitted to hospital with moderate-severe pneumonia. They were classified as undernourished (less than 80% weight for age) or nourished (greater than or equal to 80% weight for age). Serum albumin, IgG, IgA and IgM and salivary albumin and IgA were measured. Antibodies to nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae outer membrane protein and Escherichia coli O antigen were also determined in serum and saliva. Undernourished children aged less than 49 months had lower levels of serum albumin than nourished children throughout this age range. Lower values of salivary IgA were observed in infants (less than 13 months of age) than in older children, with a larger proportion of younger children having no detectable IgA. The age-related immunological profile was similar in undernourished and nourished children. At different age intervals the concentration of immunoglobulins in serum and saliva from undernourished children was generally found to be less than or the same as that from nourished children. In most cases undernourished children had lower levels of specific antibodies than nourished children but for some antibodies in some age groups the levels in the undernourished were higher. In conclusion, undernutrition was associated with hypoalbuminaemia and reduced humoral immune responses in children with pneumonia but its immunological effects varied with age in an unpredictable way.
TI  - Transcription of foreign DNA in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Propagation of heterologous DNA in E. coli host cells is central to molecular biology. DNA constructs are often engineered for expression of recombinant protein in E. coli, but the extent of incidental transcription arising from natural regulatory sequences in cloned DNA remains underexplored. Here, we have used programmable microarrays and RT-PCR to measure, comprehensively, the transcription of H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa, and human DNA propagating in E. coli as bacterial artificial chromosomes. We find evidence that at least half of all H. influenzae genes are transcribed in E. coli. Highly transcribed genes are principally involved in energy metabolism, and their proximal promoter regions are significantly enriched with E. coli sigma(70) (also known as RpoD) binding sites. H. influenzae genes acquired from an ancient bacteriophage Mu insertion are also highly transcribed. Compared with H. influenzae, a smaller proportion of P. aeruginosa genes are transcribed in E. coli, and in E. coli there is punctuated transcription of human DNA. The presence of foreign DNA in E. coli disturbs the host transcriptional profile, with expression of the E. coli phage shock protein operon and the flagellar gene cluster being particularly strongly up-regulated. While cross-species transcriptional activation is expected to be enabling for horizontal gene transfer in bacteria, incidental expression of toxic genes can be problematic for DNA cloning. Ongoing characterization of cross-expression will help inform the design of biosynthetic gene clusters and synthetic microbial genomes.
TI  - Proanthocyanidins: target compounds as antibacterial agents.
AB  - Grape seeds accumulate in huge quantities as byproduct during wine production and are therefore a cheap source for pharmacologically active agents. However, studies prove poor antibacterial activity, and results of analyses are sometimes contradictory. The aim of this study was, thus, to determine the antibacterial activity of grape seed extracts with special focus on the chromatographic characterization of active fractions. In the course of these investigations, extraction protocols were optimized so that microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) guaranteed highest preconcentration efficiency. Proanthocyanidins, monomeric flavonoid aglycones, as well as some of their glycosides could be identified within yielded extracts via high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). By that means the coherence number of possible isomers of procyanidins was approximated by a newly developed equation. As far as antibacterial activity determined via screening tests is concerned, the extracts generally have been found to be positively responsive toward 10 different gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria strains. After fractionation of the raw extracts, proanthocyanidins P2, P3, P4 and gallate esters P2G and P3G (P = proanthocyanidin consisting of catechin and epicatechin units, n = oligomerization degree, G = gallate ester) were determined as active antibacterial agents toward 10 different pathogens. Only moderate activity was found for monomeric flavonoid fractions.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic target attainment analysis of cefozopran in Japanese adult patients.
AB  - This study aimed to perform a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) target attainment analysis to create a dosing strategy for cefozopran in Japanese adult patients. A total of 145 plasma concentration samples from 32 adult patients were used for a population pharmacokinetic modeling and Monte Carlo simulation to assess the probability of attaining the PK-PD target (70% of the time above the minimum inhibitory concentration for the bacterium). The final population pharmacokinetic model was based on a two-compartment model, and creatinine clearance (Cl(cr)) and body weight (BW) were the most significant covariates: Cl(l/h) = 0.0263 x Cl(cr) + 1.49, V (c)(l) = 0.185 x BW(0.931), Q(l/h) = 4.55, V (p)(l) = 5.86, where Cl is the clearance, V (c) is the volume of distribution of the central compartment, Q is the intercompartmental clearance, and V (p) is the volume of distribution of the peripheral compartment. The Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated that 1 g q 12 h achieved a PK-PD target attainment probability of > or =85% against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. However, against Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, 1 g q 8 h and (2 g, 1 g, 1 g) q 8 h were required to achieve a high probability, which value varied with the Cl(cr) and BW of the patient. These results provide a PK-PD-based strategy for tailoring cefozopran regimens in Japanese adult patients.
TI  - Children with bacterial meningitis presenting to the emergency department during  the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine era.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of bacterial meningitis in children in the era of widespread heptavalent conjugate pneumococcal vaccination (PCV7) is unknown. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to describe the epidemiology of bacterial meningitis in children presenting to the emergency department (ED) during the era of widespread PCV7 vaccination. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all children aged 1 month to 19 years with bacterial meningitis who presented to the EDs of 20 U.S. pediatric centers (2001-2004). Bacterial meningitis was defined by a positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture for a bacterial pathogen or CSF pleocytosis (CSF white blood cell [WBC] count >or=10 cells/mm(3)) in association with either a positive blood culture or a CSF latex agglutination study. RESULTS: A total of 231 children with bacterial meningitis were identified. The median age was 0.6 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 0.2-4.2). Eight patients (3% of all patients) died. The following bacterial pathogens were identified: Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 77; 33.3%), Neisseria meningitidis (67; 29.0%), Group B Streptococcus (42; 18.2%), Escherichia coli (17; 7.4%), nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (10; 4.3%), other Gram-negative bacilli (7; 3.0%), Listeria monocytogenes (5; 2.2%), Group A Streptococcus (5; 2.2%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (1; 0.4%). S. pneumoniae serotypes were determined in 37 of 77 patients; of these, 62% were due to nonvaccine serotypes (including 19A). CONCLUSIONS: Although now a rare infectious disease in United States, bacterial meningitis still causes substantial morbidity in affected children. Despite the introduction of PCV7, S. pneumoniae remains the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in U.S. children, with approximately half of cases due to nonvaccine serotypes.
TI  - Vibrio cholerae VciB promotes iron uptake via ferrous iron transporters.
AB  - Vibrio cholerae uses a variety of strategies for obtaining iron in its diverse environments. In this study we report the identification of a novel iron utilization protein in V. cholerae, VciB. The vciB gene and its linked gene, vciA, were isolated in a screen for V. cholerae genes that permitted growth of an Escherichia coli siderophore mutant in low-iron medium. The vciAB operon encodes a predicted TonB-dependent outer membrane receptor, VciA, and a putative inner membrane protein, VciB. VciB, but not VciA, was required for growth stimulation of E. coli and Shigella flexneri strains in low-iron medium. Consistent with these findings, TonB was not needed for VciB-mediated growth. No growth enhancement was seen when vciB was expressed in an E. coli or S. flexneri strain defective for the ferrous iron transporter Feo. Supplying the E. coli feo mutant with a plasmid encoding either E. coli or V. cholerae Feo, or the S. flexneri ferrous iron transport system Sit, restored VciB-mediated growth; however, no stimulation was seen when either of the ferric uptake systems V. cholerae Fbp and Haemophilus influenzae Hit was expressed. These data indicate that VciB functions by promoting iron uptake via a ferrous, but not ferric, iron transport system. VciB-dependent iron accumulation via Feo was demonstrated directly in iron transport assays using radiolabeled iron. A V. cholerae vciB mutant did not exhibit any growth defects in either in vitro or in vivo assays, possibly due to the presence of other systems with overlapping functions in this pathogen.
TI  - [Childhood bacterial meningitis trends in Japan from 2005 to 2006].
AB  - We surveyed pediatric bacterial meningitis epidemiology from January 2005 to December 2006 in Japan, with the following results. Bacterial meningitis cases numbered 246 -138 boys and 108 girls-, equivalent to 1.7-1.72 children of 1,000 hospitalized in pediatrics per year. The age distribution for infection was highest in those under 1 year of age and decreased with increasing age, Haemophilus influenzae was the most common infection causing the pathogen, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae, group B streptococcus, and Escherichia coli. The relationship between causative pathogens and age distribution was as follows: group B streptococcus and E. coli were major pathogens in patients under 4 months old and H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae in those over 4 months old. Susceptibility tests at individual facilities showed 59.3% of H. influen- zae isolates and 69.3% of S. pneumoniae isolates in 2004 to be drug-resistant. Ampicillin and cephem antibiotics are effective against GBS, E. coli, and Listeria, so combined of ampicillin and cephem antibiotics are used as first-line antibiotics in many facilities in patients under 4 month old and combined of carbapenem antibiotics effective against PRSP and cephem effective against H. influenzae were the first choice against childhood bacterial meningitis in patients over 4 month old.
TI  - Knotted fusion proteins reveal unexpected possibilities in protein folding.
AB  - Proteins that contain a distinct knot in their native structure are impressive examples of biological self-organization. Although this topological complexity does not appear to cause a folding problem, the mechanisms by which such knotted proteins form are unknown. We found that the fusion of an additional protein domain to either the amino terminus, the carboxy terminus, or to both termini of two small knotted proteins did not affect their ability to knot. The multidomain constructs remained able to fold to structures previously thought unfeasible, some representing the deepest protein knots known. By examining the folding kinetics of these fusion proteins, we found evidence to suggest that knotting is not rate limiting during folding, but instead occurs in a denatured-like state. These studies offer experimental insights into when knot formation occurs in natural proteins and demonstrate that early folding events can lead to diverse and sometimes unexpected protein topologies.
TI  - [In-vitro activity of panipenem against clinical isolates in 2006].
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of various antibiotics against clinical bacterial isolates recovered from patients with infectious diseases at the medical facilities in the Kanto region between March and September 2006 was evaluated. A total of 1030 clinical isolates were available for susceptibility tests: 420 aerobic Gram-positive organisms, 520 aerobic Gram-negative organisms, 30 anaerobic Gram-positive organisms and 60 anaerobic Gram-negative pathogens. Antimicrobial susceptibility data for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae isolates from pediatric and adult patients were analyzed separately. Panipenem (PAPM), imipenem (IPM), meropenem (MEPM), biapenem (BIPM), doripenem (DRPM), cefozopran (CZOP), cefepime (CFPM), and sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) were used as test antibiotics. PAPM, IPM and DRPM exhibited excellent in vitro antibacterial activities against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus, with all isolates exhibiting a MIC of < or =0.06 microg/mL. Against Streptococcus including penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, PAPM demonstrated the strongest antibacterial activity among the carbapenems with a MIC range of < or =0.06 to 0.12 microg/mL. Against Enterobacteriaceae, MEPM showed the strongest antibacterial activity, and PAPM had comparable activity to IPM. Against the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species and Proteus species, the MICs for the cephems were high, however, those for the carbepenems were low. Against H. influenzae, PAPM had comparable activity to IPM. With respect to anaerobes, each of the carbapenems tested demonstrated almost the same strong antibacterial activity. In conclusion, 13 years has passed since PAPM was launched in 1993, PAPM still maintains potent antibacterial activity and is considered an effective antimicrobial agent for various types of infectious diseases.
TI  - Contribution of trimeric autotransporter C-terminal domains of oligomeric coiled-coil adhesin (Oca) family members YadA, UspA1, EibA, and Hia to translocation of the YadA passenger domain and virulence of Yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  - The Oca family is a novel class of autotransporter-adhesins with highest structural similarity in their C-terminal transmembrane region, which supposedly builds a beta-barrel pore in the outer membrane (OM). The prototype of the Oca family is YadA, an adhesin of Yersinia enterocolitica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. YadA forms a homotrimeric lollipop-like structure on the bacterial surface. The C-terminal regions of three YadA monomers form a barrel in the OM and translocate the trimeric N-terminal passenger domain, consisting of stalk, neck, and head region to the exterior. To elucidate the structural and functional role of the C-terminal translocator domain (TLD) and to assess its promiscuous capability with respect to transport of related passenger domains, we constructed chimeric YadA proteins, which consist of the N-terminal YadA passenger domain and C-terminal TLDs of Oca family members UspA1 (Moraxella catarrhalis), EibA (Escherichia coli), and Hia (Haemophilus influenzae). These constructs were expressed in Y. enterocolitica and compared for OM localization, surface exposure, oligomerization, adhesion properties, serum resistance, and mouse virulence. We demonstrate that all chimeric YadA proteins translocated the YadA passenger domain across the OM. Y. enterocolitica strains producing YadA chimeras or wild-type YadA showed comparable binding to collagen and epithelial cells. However, strains producing YadA chimeras were attenuated in serum resistance and mouse virulence. These results demonstrate for the first time that TLDs of Oca proteins of different origin are efficient translocators of the YadA passenger domain and that the cognate TLD of YadA is essential for bacterial survival in human serum and mouse virulence.
TI  - [Nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2006].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of meropenem (MEPM) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 876 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, 1764 strains of Gram-negative bacteria, and 198 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2006 was measured. The results were as follows; 1. MEPM was more active than the other carbapenem antibiotics tested against Gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae. MEPM was also active against most of the species tested in Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. 2. As for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, all of the MEPM-resistant strains were resistant to imipenem (IPM). MEPM showed low cross-resistant rate both againt IPM-resistant P. aeruginosa (41.8%) and ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa (33.3%). 3. The proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) strains was 4.3% (6 strains) in Escherichia coli, 1.1% (1 strain) in Citrobacter freundii, 21.7% (5 strains) in Citrobacter koseri, 3.1% (4 strains) in Klebsiella pneumoniae, 3.3% (3 strains) in Enterobacter cloacae, 0.8% (1 strain) in Serratia marcescens, and 4.9% (2 strains) in Providencia spp. The proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 3.1% (10 strains) in P. aeruginosa. 4. Of all species tested, there were no species, which MIC90 of MEPM was more than 4-fold higher than those in our previous study. Therefore, there is almost no significant decrease in susceptibility of clinical isolates to meropenem. In conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that MEPM retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem at present, 11 years after available for commercial use.
TI  - Bacterial efflux pump inhibitors.
AB  - Infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens play a major role in the morbidity and mortality of hospitalized patients. The rise of resistance to current antibiotic therapies has made the discovery of new agents urgent. One of the major antibiotic resistance mechanisms utilized by more than 15 species of Gram-negative bacterial cells is the Resistance Nodulation Division (RND) efflux pump, which eliminates several classes of antibiotics such as penicillins and cephalosporin macrolides aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolonesx and tetracyclines. Here we describe a multistep process to identify compounds that inhibit the RND-type efflux pumps. This involves measuring the inhibition of accumulation of ethidium bromide in E. coli or Haemophilus influenzae cells and confirming that the inhibition is specific for the efflux pumps by using genetic constructs and biochemical methods to measure nonspecific inhibition due to e.g. intrinsic antibacterial activity or membrane disruption. In whole bacterial cells synergism antagonism or indifference of the combination of an antibiotic with the putative inhibitor is determined and this is then confirmed by quantitating viable bacterial cells in liquid culture over 24 h.
TI  - Integrative analyses of posttranscriptional regulation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae using transcriptomic and proteomic data.
AB  - Correlation between mRNA and protein expression is typically modest due to substantial posttranscriptional regulation. Using large-scale transcriptomic and proteomic data of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we quantitatively examined the effects of several posttranscriptional biological properties on the correlation between mRNA and protein expression levels (mRNA-protein correlation) on a genomewide scale. The two classes of properties investigated are (1) stability of mRNA and protein molecules and (2) biological properties related to translational process, such as codon usage and amino acid usage, and experimental data of ribosome density and occupancy. The multiple regression analysis showed that while mRNA half-life and translation initiation efficiency (estimated as mRNA secondary structure in the 5'-UTR) do not appear to have remarkable contributions to the variations in the mRNA-protein correlation, protein half-life descriptor (PHD) is identified as the most important property affecting mRNA-protein correlation (contributing to 16.87% of the total variation in mRNA-protein correlation), suggesting protein degradation significantly affects mRNA-protein correlation. Codon usage and amino acid composition contribute to 8.89% and 7.60% of the total variation, respectively, which is consistent with several previous studies in bacteria (such as Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Desulfovibrio vulgaris), suggesting that mRNA-protein correlation is affected the most by elongation during protein translation. Taken together, all posttranscriptional biological properties contributed to 33.15% of the total variation of mRNA-protein correlation.
TI  - [Analysis on variance of common pathogenic bacteria and drug resistance in children in Chengdu area from 2001 to 2006].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the variance and drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria isolated from children with infectious diseases seen between 2001 and 2006 in Chengdu area. METHODS: A total of 2888 pathogenic bacterial strains isolated from children in Chengdu Children's Hospital from 2001 to 2006 were analyzed. Tests were performed according to the guidelines of National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) of the United States. RESULT: (1) Of the 2888 strains, 1845 (63.9%) were Gram negative bacteria. The main pathogenic bacteria included Escherichia coli (Ec, 718 strain, 24.9%), Hemophilus (H, 476 strain, 16.5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp, 412 strain, 14.3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp, 369 strain, 12.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (Sa, 353 strain, 12.2%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (Se, 278 strain, 9.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa, 146 strain, 5.1%) and other non-zymocyte (Onz, 136 strain, 4.7%). (2) The common pathogens found in blood specimen were 158 strain, which included Se (78 strain, 49.4%), Ec (23 strain, 14.6%), Kp (17 strain, 10.8%), Sa (14 strain, 8.9%), Onz (14 strain, 8.9%), Sp (7 strain, 4.4%) and Pa (5 strain, 3.2%). (3) The number of common pathogens isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infection was 2018, including Ec (441 strains, 21.9%), H (430 strains, 21.3%), Sp (368 strains, 18.2%), Kp (253 strains, 12.5%), Sa (207 strains, 10.3%), Se (149 strains, 7.3%), Pa (97 strains, 4.8%) and Onz (73 strains, 3.6%). (4) There were 120 strains of common pathogens isolated from urine specimens, including Ec (78 strains, 65%), Kp (25 strains, 20.8%), Onz (7 strains, 5.8%), Pa (5 strains, 4.2%) and Se (5 strains, 4.2%). (5) There were 497 strains of common pathogens found in pus specimens, including Ec 167 strains, (33.6%), Sa (126 strains, 25.4%), Se (46 strains, 9.3%), H (44 strains, 8.9%), Onz (37 stains, 7.4%), Kp (31 strains, 6.2%), Sp (26 strains, 5.2%) and Pa (20 strain, 4.0%). The trend of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics deteriorated. The proportion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was 6.7% and the methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci (MRCNS) rate was 20% in 2001 - 2003. The total proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase stains (ESBL(S)) in Ec and Kp was 21.8%, and the rate of beta-lactamase production stains of Hemophilus influenzae (Hi) was 19.4% in 2001 - 2003.The proportion of MRSA was 17.2% and the MRCNS rate was 70.2%, the total proportion of ESBL(S) in Ec and Kp was 43.8%, and the rate of beta-lactamase producing stains of Hi was 39.7% in 2004 - 2006. CONCLUSION: The distribution of common pathogenic bacteria seen in Chengdu Children's Hospital has changed and the trend of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics deteriorated in recent three years. Regionally monitoring the changes in pathogenic bacteria and the trend of drug resistance to antibiotics is paramount in guiding the pediatric clinical treatment.
TI  - Subdural empyema in children--20-year experience in a medical center.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Subdural empyema (SDE) is a serious neurological condition in children and adults. Although otorhinolaryngeal infections are regarded as the most important predisposing factors in the literature, this has not been our experience. This study reviewed clinical data on pediatric patients with SDE at our institution over the last 20 years. METHODS: Charts of children hospitalized in Mackay Memorial Hospital from 1985 to 2005, with a final diagnosis of SDE were reviewed. Gender, predisposing factors, symptoms and signs, bacteriologic data, diagnostic work-up, treatment procedures, and outcome were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 31 patients were enrolled. Twenty seven of them (87.1%) were below the age of one year. The male-to-female ratio was 1.21. Only 3 patients (9.7%) had prior otorhinolaryngeal infections; 6 patients (19.4%) had SDE following head trauma or surgery. The leading clinical manifestations were fever (96.8%), seizure (70.1%), and focal neurological signs (58.1%). The most common pathogens included Streptococcus pneumoniae (16.1%), group B Streptococcus (12.9%), Haemophilus influenzae type b (12.9%), Salmonella spp. (12.9%), Escherichia coli (9.7%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.7%). Cerebrospinal fluid leukocyte counts and protein levels were usually high and the glucose levels were usually low. SDE was first suspected or found via brain sonography in 9 infants. Nine patients (29.0%) received only medical treatment for SDE. Three patients (9.7%) died--all were infected by S. pneumoniae. Twelve patients (38.7%) recovered without neurological sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: In the past 20 years, most of our cases of pediatric SDE occurred in infancy, and only one-tenth of them had prior otorhinolaryngeal infections. Brain sonography could be a helpful tool for early diagnosis of SDE in infancy.
TI  - Backbone 1H, 15N, and 13C resonance assignments and secondary-structure of the conserved hypothetical protein HP0892 of Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - HP0892 (SwissProt/TrEMBL ID O25552) is a 90-residue conserved hypothetical protein from Helicobacter pylori strain 26695, with a calculated pI of 9.38 and a molecular mass of 10.41 kDa. It belongs to the Plasmid stabilization system protein family (PF05016) in the Pfam database. Proteins with sequence similarity to HP0892 exist in Vibrio choierae, Enterococcus faecalis, Campylobacter jejuni, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli O157. Here we report the sequence-specific backbone resonance assignments of HP0892 using multidimentional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. About 97.0% (422/ 435) of the HN, N, CO, C Alpha , C Beta resonances of 90 residues of HP0892 were assigned. On the basis of the resonance assignments, three helical regions and four strand regions were identified using the CSI program. This study is a prerequisite for calculating the solution structure of HP0892, and will be useful for studying its interaction with other molecules.
TI  - Identification of an inhibitor of the MurC enzyme, which catalyzes an essential step in the peptidoglycan precursor synthesis pathway.
AB  - The pathway for synthesis of the peptidoglycan precursor UDP-N-acetylmuramyl pentapeptide is essential in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. This pathway has been exploited in the recent past to identify potential new antibiotics as inhibitors of one or more of the Mur enzymes. In the present study, a high-throughput screen was employed to identify potential inhibitors of the Escherichia coli MurC (UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid:L-alanine ligase), the first of four paralogous amino acid-adding enzymes. Inhibition of ATP consumed during the MurC reaction, using an adaptation of a kinase assay format, identified a number of potential inhibitory chemotypes. After nonspecific inhibition testing and chemical attractiveness were assessed, C-1 emerged as a compound for further characterization. The inhibition of MurC by this compound was confirmed in both a kinetic-coupled enzyme assay and a direct nuclear magnetic resonance product detection assay. C-1 was found to be a low micromolar inhibitor of the E. coli MurC reaction, with preferential inhibition by one of two enantiomeric forms. Experiments indicated that it was a competitive inhibitor of ATP binding to the MurC enzyme. Further work with MurC enzymes from several bacterial sources revealed that while the compound was equally effective at inhibiting MurC from genera (Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae) closely related to E. coli, MurC enzymes from more distant Gram-negative species such as Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter baylyi, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not inhibited.
TI  - AIMIE: a web-based environment for detection and interpretation of significant sequence motifs in prokaryotic genomes.
AB  - MOTIVATION: Genomes contain biologically significant information that extends beyond that encoded in genes. Some of this information relates to various short dispersed repeats distributed throughout the genome. The goal of this work was to combine tools for detection of statistically significant dispersed repeats in DNA sequences with tools to aid development of hypotheses regarding their possible physiological functions in an easy-to-use web-based environment. RESULTS: Ab Initio Motif Identification Environment (AIMIE) was designed to facilitate investigations of dispersed sequence motifs in prokaryotic genomes. We used AIMIE to analyze the Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae genomes in order to demonstrate the utility of the new environment. AIMIE detected repeated extragenic palindrome (REP) elements, CRISPR repeats, uptake signal sequences, intergenic dyad sequences and several other over-represented sequence motifs. Distributional patterns of these motifs were analyzed using the tools included in AIMIE. AVAILABILITY: AIMIE and the related software can be accessed at our web site http://www.cmbl.uga.edu/software.html.
TI  - [Distribution and drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria in children with lower respiratory tract infection from Chengdu Children's Hospital between 2001 and 2006].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution and the changes of drug resistance of  common pathogenic bacteria in children with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) of Chengdu. METHODS: Sputum specimens for bacterial cultures were collected from children with LRTL who had been admitted to the Chengdu Children's Hospital between 2001 and 2006. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed after bacteria had been identified. The results between 2001 and 2003 were compared with those between 2004 and 2006. RESULTS: Hemophilus (24.3%) was the most common pathogenic bacteria for LRTI in children between 2001 and 2003, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (18.8%), Escherichia coli (18.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.0%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (6.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.4%) and other non-zymocyte (4.4%). Escherichia coli (23.7%) was the most common pathogenic bacteria in children with LRTL between 2004 and 2006, followed by Hemophilus (19.8%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (17.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.3%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.0%) and other non-zymocyte (3.2%). Compared with the years of 2001-2003, the rate of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics between 2004 and 2006 increased: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 18.0% vs 8.8%, Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci 70.5% vs 18.1%, Extended-spetrum beta-lactamase stains 44.4% vs 22.6%, and beta-lactamase production stains of Hemophilus influenzae 40.2% vs 20.1%. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of common pathogenic bacteria of children with LRTL has changed and the rate of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics is increasing in recent three years in Chengdu.
TI  - Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in intensive care units in Canada: results of the Canadian National Intensive Care Unit (CAN-ICU) study, 2005-2006.
AB  - Between 1 September 2005 and 30 June 2006, 19 medical centers collected 4,180 isolates recovered from clinical specimens from patients in intensive care units (ICUs) in Canada. The 4,180 isolates were collected from 2,292 respiratory specimens (54.8%), 738 blood specimens (17.7%), 581 wound/tissue specimens (13.9%), and 569 urinary specimens (13.6%). The 10 most common organisms isolated from 79.5% of all clinical specimens were methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (16.4%), Escherichia coli (12.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.0%), Haemophilus influenzae (7.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci/Staphylococcus epidermidis (6.5%), Enterococcus spp. (6.1%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.8%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (4.7%), and Enterobacter cloacae (3.9%). MRSA made up 22.3% (197/884) of all S. aureus isolates (90.9% of MRSA were health care-associated MRSA, and 9.1% were community-associated MRSA), while vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) made up 6.7% (11/255) of all enterococcal isolates (88.2% of VRE had the vanA genotype). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae occurred in 3.5% (19/536) and 1.8% (4/224) of isolates, respectively. All 19 ESBL-producing E. coli isolates were PCR positive for CTX-M, with bla CTX-M-15 occurring in 74% (14/19) of isolates. For MRSA, no resistance against daptomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, and vancomycin was observed, while the resistance rates to other agents were as follows: clarithromycin, 89.9%; clindamycin, 76.1%; fluoroquinolones, 90.1 to 91.8%; and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 11.7%. For E. coli, no resistance to amikacin, meropenem, and tigecycline was observed, while resistance rates to other agents were as follows: cefazolin, 20.1%; cefepime, 0.7%; ceftriaxone, 3.7%; gentamicin, 3.0%; fluoroquinolones, 21.1%; piperacillin-tazobactam, 1.9%; and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 24.8%. Resistance rates for P. aeruginosa were as follows: amikacin, 2.6%; cefepime, 10.2%; gentamicin, 15.2%; fluoroquinolones, 23.8 to 25.5%; meropenem, 13.6%; and piperacillin-tazobactam, 9.3%. A multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype (resistance to three or more of the following drugs: cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, amikacin or gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin) occurred frequently in P. aeruginosa (12.6%) but uncommonly in E. coli (0.2%), E. cloacae (0.6%), or K. pneumoniae (0%). In conclusion, S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA), E. coli, P. aeruginosa, H. influenzae, Enterococcus spp., S. pneumoniae, and K. pneumoniae are the most common isolates recovered from clinical specimens in Canadian ICUs. A MDR phenotype is common for P. aeruginosa isolates in Canadian ICUs.
TI  - Structure of YciA from Haemophilus influenzae (HI0827), a hexameric broad specificity acyl-coenzyme A thioesterase.
AB  - The crystal structure of HI0827 from Haemophilus influenzae Rd KW20, initially annotated "hypothetical protein" in sequence databases, exhibits an acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) thioesterase "hot dog" fold with a trimer of dimers oligomeric association, a novel assembly for this enzyme family. In studies described in the preceding paper [Zhuang, Z., Song, F., Zhao, H., Li, L., Cao, J., Eisenstein, E., Herzberg, O., and Dunaway-Mariano, D. (2008) Biochemistry 47, 2789-2796], HI0827 is shown to be an acyl-CoA thioesterase that acts on a wide range of acyl-CoA compounds. Two substrate binding sites are located across the dimer interface. The binding sites are occupied by two CoA molecules, one with full occupancy and the second only partially occupied. The CoA molecules, acquired from HI0827-expressing Escherichia coli cells, remained tightly bound to the enzyme through the protein purification steps. The difference in CoA occupancies indicates a different substrate affinity for each of the binding sites, which in turn implies that the enzyme might be subject to allosteric regulation. Mutagenesis studies have shown that the replacement of the putative catalytic carboxylate Asp44 with an alanine residue abolishes activity. The impact of this mutation is seen in the crystal structure of D44A HI0827. Whereas the overall fold and assembly of the mutant protein are the same as those of the wild-type enzyme, the CoA ligands are absent. The dimer interface is perturbed, and the channel that accommodates the thioester acyl chain is more open and wider than that observed in the wild-type enzyme. A model of intact substrate bound to wild-type HI0827 provides a structural rationale for the broad substrate range.
TI  - Divergence of function in the hot dog fold enzyme superfamily: the bacterial thioesterase YciA.
AB  - Thioesters play a central role in the cells where they participate in metabolism, membrane synthesis, signal transduction, and gene regulation. Thioesters are converted to the thiol and carboxylic acid components by thioesterase-catalyzed hydrolysis. Here we examine the biochemical and biological function of the hot dog fold thioesterase YciA (EcYciA) from Escherichia coli and its close sequence homologue HI0827 from Haemophilus influenzae (HiYciA). The quaternary structure of HiYciA was determined, using equilibrium sedimentation techniques, to be a homohexamer. Mass spectral and (31)P NMR analysis of purified HiYciA revealed a bound CoA ligand. Kinetic analyses showed that CoA is a strong feedback inhibitor. YciA thioesterase activity toward acyl-CoA substrates was determined using steady-state kinetic methods. The k cat and k cat/ K m values obtained reveal a striking combination of high catalytic efficiency and low substrate specificity. The substrate activity of propionyl-s- N-acetylcysteine was found to be negligible and that of n-butyryl-pantetheinephosphate low, and therefore, it is evident YciA does not target acylated ACPs or other acylated proteins as substrates. The results from bioinformatic analysis of the biological distribution and genome contexts of yciAs are reported. We conclude that YciA is responsible for the efficient, "seemingly" indiscriminant, CoA-regulated hydrolysis of cellular acyl-CoA thioesters in a wide range of bacteria and hypothesize that this activity may support membrane biogenesis.
TI  - RecJ, ExoI and RecG are required for genome maintenance but not for generation of genetic diversity by repeat-mediated phase variation in Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - High levels of genetic diversity are generated in Haemophilus influenzae populations through DNA repeat-mediated phase variation and recombination with DNA fragments acquired by uptake from the external milieu. Conversely, multiple pathways for maintenance of the genome sequence are encoded in H. influenzae genomes. In Escherichia coli, mutations in single-stranded-DNA exonucleases destabilise tandem DNA repeats whilst inactivation of recG can stabilise repeat tracts. These enzymes also have varying effects on recombination. Deletion mutations were constructed in H. influenzae genes encoding homologs of ExoI, RecJ and RecG whilst ExoVII was refractory to mutation. Inactivation of RecJ and RecG, but not ExoI, increased sensitivity to irradiation with ultraviolet light. An increase in spontaneous mutation rate was not observed in single mutants but only when both RecJ and ExoI were mutated. None of the single- or double-mutations increased or decreased the rates of slippage in tetranucleotide repeat tracts. Furthermore, the exonuclease mutants did not exhibit significant defects in horizontal gene transfer. We conclude that RecJ, ExoI and RecG are required for maintenance of the H. influenzae genome but none of these enzymes influence the generation of genetic diversity through mutations in the tetranucleotide repeat tracts of this species.
TI  - Microbiological surveillance and parenteral antibiotic use in a critical care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate parenteral antibiotic utilization and bacterial resistance patterns in a critical care unit (CrCU). DESIGN: Descriptive, prospective audit of infection site, culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test results, parenteral antibiotic usage and duration, total antibiotic acquisition costs, and length of stay. SETTING: A 17-bed medical-surgical CrCU in a tertiary care teaching hospital in Metropolitan Toronto. PATIENTS: Two hundred and fifty-eight patients admitted to the CrCU between May 1995 and April 1996 who received antimicrobial therapy. RESULTS: The most frequently prescribed antibiotics were cefazolin (47%, 1098 g), gentamicin (33%,141 g) and ceftriaxone (20%, 255 g). The most common indications for antimicrobial therapy included surgical prophylaxis (34%) and pneumonia (35%). The following organisms were isolated from patients treated with antibiotics: Staphylococcus aureus (26%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13%), enterococci (12%), Haemophilus influenzae (11%), Escherichia coli (11%), Enterobacter cloacae (8%) and other Gram-negative bacilli (19%). Only 9% of Gram-negative bacilli were resistant to aminoglycosides, 3% were resistant to ciprofloxacin and no extended-spectrum beta-lactamases or imipenem-resistance were detected. No vancomycin-resistant enterococci and only two methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic use during the audit appeared appropriate for the specific clinical indications. Low levels of bacterial resistance were detected during the audit.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of tigecycline against aerobic and facultative isolates recovered from hospitalized patients: an Argentinean multicenter study.
AB  - Tigecycline, the 9-t-butylglycylamino derivative of minocycline is the first commercially available glycylcycline exhibiting an extended spectrum of antibacterial activity due to its capacity to evade the tetracycline ribosomal and efflux resistance mechanisms. We conducted a collaborative in vitro study determining the activity of tigecycline compared to 14 antimicrobials against clinically relevant isolates obtained from adult patients hospitalized in 9 Argentinean institutions. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the reference broth microdilution method. The number of isolates and MICs 50/90 (mg/L) for tigecycline were the following: Acinetobacter spp. 132 (0.5/1); Escherichia coli 220 (0.12/0.25); Klebsiella spp. 220 (0.5/1), Enterobacter spp. 205 (0.5/1); Serratia spp. 84 (0.5/2); Haemophilus influenzae 96 (0.25/0.5); Staphylococcus aureus 223 (0.12/0.25); Streptococcus pneumoniae 98 (<or= 0.25/1); S. agalactiae 51 (0.5/0.5); Enterococcus spp. 104 (0.06/0.12); Pseudomonas aeruginosa 169 (8/16). We conclude that tigecycline is a promising drug for the treatment of infections in hospitalized patients in Argentina.
TI  - Tigecycline in vitro activity against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens collected in Italy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this study (part of the global TEST program), the in vitro activity of tigecycline, a member of a new class of antimicrobial agents, the glycylcyclines, against clinical isolates collected in Italy was evaluated. METHODS: A total of 200 clinical isolates were collected and identified in our institution during 2005. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the antimicrobial agents were determined by the broth microdilution method recommended by the CLSI in 2005. RESULTS: Globally, 135 Gram-negative and 65 Gram-positive pathogens were evaluated. Tigecycline demonstrated excellent inhibitory activity against Acinetobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pneumoniae with MIC(90) <or=1 mg/l. CONCLUSION: Tigecycline exhibited potent in vitro antibacterial activity (comparable to or greater than most commonly employed antimicrobials) against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinical pathogens. These data suggest that tigecycline, with an expanded broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, may be an effective empiric therapeutic option for the treatment of serious infections caused by clinically relevant pathogens.
TI  - [Compromised immune function in multiple myeloma].
AB  - Patients with multiple myeloma are at risk for bacterial infections such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Escherichia coli. Administering oral sulfamethoxazole -trimethoprim for the first 2 months of initial chemotherapy was effective prophylaxis for bacterial infection. Specific antibody titers for S. pneumoniae were significantly reduced in patients compared with normal controls. Pneumococcal vaccination was effective around 30-40% of patients. The response rate of influenza vaccination was also limited. Intravenous immunoglobulin was useful for prophylaxis of severe bacterial infection during plateau-phase of multiple myeloma. The patients who benefit most could be identified by measuring IgG antibody responses to pneumococcal vaccination.
TI  - Identification of a novel Haemophilus influenzae protein important for adhesion to epithelial cells.
AB  - Non-typable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is an important human-specific respiratory pathogen colonizing the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract. The bacterium is a common cause of acute otitis media in children and exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). An immunoglobulin (Ig) D-lambda myeloma protein was found to detect a 16 kDa surface protein that we designated protein E (PE). The pe gene was cloned using an NTHi genomic DNA library, and a truncated PE-derived protein lacking the endogenous signal peptide (PE22-160) was synthesized and produced in large amounts in Escherichia coli. Interestingly, PE was expressed at the bacterial surface of NTHi as revealed by flow cytometry using the IgD-lambda myeloma protein or PE-specific polyclonal antibodies. A PE-deficient NTHi mutant was produced and lost 50% of its adhesive capacity as compared to the wild-type counterpart when analysed for adhesion to type II lung alveolar epithelial cells. In parallel, E. coli expressing full-length PE1-160 adhered significantly more efficiently to epithelial cells as compared to wild-type E. coli. Recombinant IgD that recognized the chemical dansyl-chloride did not interact with PE indicating that the IgD-lambda myeloma protein most likely was an antibody directed against the H. influenzae surface epitope. In conclusion, we have discovered a novel NTHi outer membrane protein with adhesive properties using an IgD-myeloma protein.
TI  - [Currarino syndrome a rare cause of recurrent purulent meningitis].
AB  - The authors report a case of partial Currarino syndrome in a three and a half year old child with a left hemisacrum agenesis and a presacral mature teratoma. The special aspect of the observation was the apparition of repetitive polymicrobial purulent meningitis (Escherichia coli, Streptococcus B, Haemophilus influenzae) treated several times with non-specific antibiotics without normalization of CSF, particularly the CSF glucose, which remained low, justifying the use of an antimycobacterial treatment, especially since there was no local or general cause explaining the relapse. During a relapse of meningitis after ten months of antituberculosis treatment, the teratoma was discovered by a spine MRI done to detect any cerebrospinal defect. The authors insist on the fact that the Currarino syndrome must be investigated in case of repetitive purulent meningitis after ruling out the usual causes of meningitis.
TI  - The clinical development and launch of amoxicillin/clavulanate for the treatment  of a range of community-acquired infections.
AB  - By the 1960s and 1970s, problems in the antibacterial treatment of infections had begun to emerge. Previously active antibacterials were being compromised by the development of resistance. Beta-lactamase production was identified in isolates of staphylococci, and, amongst others, in Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. The discovery of the potent beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid, and its protective effect on amoxicillin, a semi-synthetic penicillin with good oral absorption and potent broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, was thus of great importance in the treatment of bacterial disease. Following preliminary clinical studies in bronchitis and urinary tract infections, amoxicillin/clavulanate therapy was investigated in a wide range of infections and proved to demonstrate a high level of clinical efficacy. These results supported the launch of amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin) in 1981 for use in upper and lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections and obstetric, gynaecological and intra-abdominal infections.
TI  - RNA secondary structure regulates the translation of sxy and competence development in Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The sxy (tfoX) gene product is the central regulator of DNA uptake by naturally competent gamma-proteobacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae, Vibrio cholerae and probably Escherichia coli. However, the mechanisms regulating sxy gene expression are not understood despite being key to understanding the physiological role of DNA uptake. We have isolated mutations in H. influenzae sxy that greatly elevate translation and thus cause competence to develop in otherwise non-inducing conditions (hypercompetence). In vitro nuclease analysis confirmed the existence of an extensive secondary structure at the 5' end of sxy mRNA that sequesters the ribosome-binding site and start codon in a stem-loop. All of the hypercompetence mutations reduced mRNA base pairing, and one was shown to cause a global destabilization that increased translational efficiency. Conversely, mutations engineered to add mRNA base pairs strengthened the secondary structure, resulting in reduced translational efficiency and greatly reduced competence for genetic transformation. Transfer of wild-type cells to starvation medium improved translational efficiency of sxy while independently triggering the sugar starvation regulator (CRP) to stimulate transcription at the sxy promoter. Thus, mRNA secondary structure is responsive to conditions where DNA uptake will be favorable, and transcription of sxy is simultaneously enhanced if CRP activation signals that energy supplies are limited.
TI  - Expression, purification and characterisation of Haemophilus influenzae 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (LeuB).
AB  - 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (3IPMDH) is the third enzyme in leucine biosynthesis and a promising target for the development of broad-spectrum antibacterial agents. We report here the expression, purification and biochemical characterisation of Haemophilus influenzae 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase. The observed enzyme inhibition by the reaction product NADH could represent a regulatory mechanism for 3IPMDH.
TI  - Comparison of the chemical and thermal denaturation of proteins by a two-state transition model.
AB  - The conformational stabilities of eight proteins in terms of the free energy differences between the native "folded" state of the protein and its "unfolded" state were determined at 298 K by two methods: chemical denaturation at 298 K and extrapolation to 298 K of the thermal denaturation results at high temperature. The proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli from the Haemophilus influenzae and E. coli genes at different levels of expression, covered a molecular mass range from 13 to 37 kg mol(-1) per monomeric unit (some exhibiting unique structural features), and were oligomeric up to four subunits. The free energy differences were determined by application of a two-state transition model to the chemical and thermal denaturation results, ranged from 9.4 to 148 kJ mol(-1) at 298 K, and were found to be within the experimental uncertainties of both methods for all of the proteins. Any contributions from intermediate states detectable from chemical and thermal denaturation differences in the unfolding free energy differences in these proteins are within the experimental uncertainties of both methods.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of a novel propolis formulation (Actichelated propolis).
AB  - AIMS: This study compared in vitro activities of Actichelated propolis (a multicomposite material obtained with mechano-chemichal activation) and of a hydroalcoholic extract of propolis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC), determined by means of microdilution broth method, against five strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, showed a greater potency of Actichelated propolis (MIC range: 0.016-4 mg flavonoids ml(-1)) in respect to the hydroalcoholic extract (MIC range: 0.08-21.4 mg flavonoids ml(-1)). Concentrations of Actichelated propolis active against adenovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus and herpes virus type 1 were at least 10 times lower than those of the hydroalcoholic extract. Preincubation of Strep. pyogenes and H. influenzae with subinhibitory concentrations of Actichelated propolis (1/4 and 1/8 x MIC) significantly reduced the number of bacteria that adhered to human buccal cells. CONCLUSIONS: Actichelated propolis has proven to possess antibacterial and antiviral activity higher than a hydroalcoholic extract, being also able to interfere on bacterial adhesion to human oral cells. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This new formulation of propolis showing better antimicrobial and physical characteristics could improve the application of propolis in respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Characterization of the N-acetyl-5-neuraminic acid-binding site of the extracytoplasmic solute receptor (SiaP) of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae strain 2019.
AB  - Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae is an opportunistic human pathogen causing otitis media in children and chronic bronchitis and pneumonia in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The outer membrane of nontypeable H. influenzae is dominated by lipooligosaccharides (LOS), many of which incorporate sialic acid as a terminal nonreducing sugar. Sialic acid has been demonstrated to be an important factor in the survival of the bacteria within the host environment. H. influenzae is incapable of synthesizing sialic acid and is dependent on scavenging free sialic acid from the host environment. To achieve this, H. influenzae utilizes a tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic transporter. In this study, we characterize the binding site of the extracytoplasmic solute receptor (SiaP) from nontypeable H. influenzae strain 2019. A crystal structure of N-acetyl-5-neuraminic acid (Neu5Ac)-bound SiaP was determined to 1.4A resolution. Thermodynamic characterization of Neu5Ac binding shows this interaction is enthalpically driven with a substantial unfavorable contribution from entropy. This is expected because the binding of SiaP to Neu5Ac is mediated by numerous hydrogen bonds and has several buried water molecules. Point mutations targeting specific amino acids were introduced in the putative binding site. Complementation with the mutated siaP constructs resulted either in full, partial, or no complementation, depending on the role of specific residues. Mass spectrometry analysis of the O-deacylated LOS of the R127K point mutation confirmed the observation of reduced incorporation of Neu5Ac into the LOS. The decreased ability of H. influenzae to import sialic acid had negative effects on resistance to complement-mediated killing and viability of biofilms in vitro, confirming the importance of sialic acid transport to the bacterium.
TI  - Local Renyi entropic profiles of DNA sequences.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In a recent report the authors presented a new measure of continuous  entropy for DNA sequences, which allows the estimation of their randomness level. The definition therein explored was based on the Renyi entropy of probability density estimation (pdf) using the Parzen's window method and applied to Chaos Game Representation/Universal Sequence Maps (CGR/USM). Subsequent work proposed a fractal pdf kernel as a more exact solution for the iterated map representation. This report extends the concepts of continuous entropy by defining DNA sequence entropic profiles using the new pdf estimations to refine the density estimation of motifs. RESULTS: The new methodology enables two results. On the one hand it shows that the entropic profiles are directly related with the statistical significance of motifs, allowing the study of under and over-representation of segments. On the other hand, by spanning the parameters of the kernel function it is possible to extract important information about the scale of each conserved DNA region. The computational applications, developed in Matlab m-code, the corresponding binary executables and additional material and examples are made publicly available at http://kdbio.inesc-id.pt/~svinga/ep/. CONCLUSION: The ability to detect local conservation from a scale-independent representation of symbolic sequences is particularly relevant for biological applications where conserved motifs occur in multiple, overlapping scales, with significant future applications in the recognition of foreign genomic material and inference of motif structures.
TI  - [First experience with detecting bacterial DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with purulent meningitis using broad spectrum multiplex nested PCR].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To propose and verify a PCR assay for detecting Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus species, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis serogroups B and C in a single sample of the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with purulent meningitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: DNA from the cerebrospinal fluid was isolated using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit. PCR was performed as two-step amplification (nested PCR). For E. coli, H. influenzae, L. monocytogenes, S. species and S. pneumoniae, universal and species-specific primers encoding bacterial 16S rDNA were used in the first and second reaction, respectively. For N. meningitidis serogroups B and C, an amplification system with primers for the SiaD gene was utilized. RESULTS: Of 25 patients examined at the beginning of their treatment, bacterial DNA was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of 17 (68 %) of them. Those were six cases of N. meningitidis serogroup B, four of N. meningitidis serogroup C, five of S. pneumoniae, one of H. influenzae and one of L. monocytogenes. Of 7 patients in whom antibiotic therapy was initiated prior to diagnostic lumbar puncture, PCR was positive in four cases. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed nested PCR approach is faster than traditional culture methods and suitable for early laboratory diagnosis of infectious agents. When compared to culture methods, the technique offers slightly higher positivity (by 16 %). This is similar in samples analyzed after the initiation of antibiotic therapy. The PCR method never detected other bacteria than the cultured ones.
TI  - IIAGlc inhibition of glycerol kinase: a communications network tunes protein motions at the allosteric site.
AB  - Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy methods applied to an extrinsic fluorophore that is conjugated to non-native cysteine residues demonstrate that amino acids in an allosteric communication network within a protein subunit tune protein backbone motions at a distal site to enable allosteric binding and inhibition. The unphosphorylated form of the phosphocarrier protein IIAGlc is an allosteric inhibitor of Escherichia coli glycerol kinase, binding more than 25 A from the kinase active site. Crystal structures that showed a ligand-dependent conformational change and large temperature factors for the IIAGlc-binding site on E. coli glycerol kinase suggest that motions of the allosteric site have an important role in the inhibition. Three E. coli glycerol kinase amino acids that are located at least 15 A from the active site and the allosteric site were shown previously to be necessary for transplanting IIAGlc inhibition into the nonallosteric glycerol kinase from Haemophilus influenzae. These three amino acids are termed the coupling locus. The apparent allosteric site motions and the requirement for the distant coupling locus to transplant allosteric inhibition suggest that the coupling locus modulates the motions of the IIAGlc-binding site. To evaluate this possibility, variants of E. coli glycerol kinase and the chimeric, allosteric H. influenzae glycerol kinase were constructed with a non-native cysteine residue replacing one of the native residues in the IIAGlc-binding site. The extrinsic fluorophore Oregon Green 488 (2',7'-difluorofluorescein) was conjugated specifically to the non-native cysteine residue. Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements show that the motions of the fluorophore reflect backbone motions of the IIAGlc-binding site and these motions are modulated by the amino acids at the coupling locus.
TI  - SHARCGS, a fast and highly accurate short-read assembly algorithm for de novo genomic sequencing.
AB  - The latest revolution in the DNA sequencing field has been brought about by the development of automated sequencers that are capable of generating giga base pair data sets quickly and at low cost. Applications of such technologies seem to be limited to resequencing and transcript discovery, due to the shortness of the generated reads. In order to extend the fields of application to de novo sequencing, we developed the SHARCGS algorithm to assemble short-read (25-40-mer) data with high accuracy and speed. The efficiency of SHARCGS was tested on BAC inserts from three eukaryotic species, on two yeast chromosomes, and on two bacterial genomes (Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli). We show that 30-mer-based BAC assemblies have N50 sizes >20 kbp for Drosophila and Arabidopsis and >4 kbp for human in simulations taking missing reads and wrong base calls into account. We assembled 949,974 contigs with length >50 bp, and only one single contig could not be aligned error-free against the reference sequences. We generated 36-mer reads for the genome of Helicobacter acinonychis on the Illumina 1G sequencing instrument and assembled 937 contigs covering 98% of the genome with an N50 size of 3.7 kbp. With the exception of five contigs that differ in 1-4 positions relative to the reference sequence, all contigs matched the genome error-free. Thus, SHARCGS is a suitable tool for fully exploiting novel sequencing technologies by assembling sequence contigs de novo with high confidence and by outperforming existing assembly algorithms in terms of speed and accuracy.
TI  - Polymicrobial skull osteomyelitis: a rare complication of subdural hematoma evacuation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Osteomyelitis of the skull (SO) is a rare condition. The infection may complicate community-acquired sinusitis, otitis, or mastoiditis, in which case, the skull base is affected most commonly. The flora typically seen in these conditions, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, tends also to be responsible for the SO. Osteomyelitis also may follow neurosurgical procedures that breach the skull, in which case, the pathogens frequently are typical cutaneous flora such as Staphylococcus aureus or coagulase-negative staphylococci. METHODS: A case report of post-neurosurgical SO and a review of the relevant English-language literature. RESULTS: We report a delayed presentation of SO after craniotomy for the evacuation of a chronic subdural hematoma. Cranial tissue cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium spp., and Escherichia coli. CONCLUSIONS: The isolation of Escherichia coli as an infecting organism in SO has been reported rarely and may reflect a unique pathogenesis.
TI  - Community-acquired pneumonia in Thai patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.
AB  - Infection, particularly pneumonia, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This study was performed to assess the prevalence, causative organisms, and outcomes of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in Thai SLE patients, and determine the predicting factors for death. A retrospective chart review of adult SLE patients, age >16 years, seen at the Division of Rheumatology, Chiang Mai University over an 18 year period was carried out. Cases diagnosed with CAP were selected for this study. Of 542 SLE patients, a total of 56 episodes of CAP occurred in 52 patients. Their mean age +/- SD and duration of SLE were 37.98 +/- 11.48 years and 34.99 +/- 54.53 months, respectively. Thirty-three CAP cases (58.9%) occurred within the first year of diagnosis with SLE. The causative organisms identifiable in 40 patients (71.5%) were Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 12, Nocardia spp in 6, Aspergillus spp in 5, Staphylococcus aureus in 3, Pneumocystis carinii, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2 each, and Acinetobactor baumanii, Burkholderia pseudomallei, and Strongyloides stercoralis in 1 each. The remaining 3 patients had mixed bacterial infection. The overall mortality rate was 26.8%. Use of high dose prednisolone (> or =15 mg/day), and ventilator support were significantly associated with death.
TI  - [Species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility tests by the fully automated RAISUS using an early-harvested cell suspension].
AB  - We evaluated the usefulness of an early-harvested bacterial cell suspension to the fully automated RAISUS (Nissui Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., Tokyo) to provide the results of species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testings within a day after overnight-incubation of the primary cultures. A single, well-separated colony appeared on the primary culture plate was transferred onto a blood agar or chocolate agar plates, then incubated for 3 to 6 hours. The cell suspension to the RAISUS was properly prepared to the McFarland 0.5 turbidity from the early-harvested bacterial cells. When the five ATCC reference strains, consisting of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, were repeatedly tested for the species-identification, all the identification results were acceptable. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were evaluated with the above five strains and Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247. The results obtained indicated that the most susceptibility test results were comparable to those MICs obtained by the standard test procedure, but some strains, in particular, H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa gave significantly discrepant MICs for certain antimicrobial agents. The significant discrepancy in MIC determinations regarded the difference of viable cell concentrations in the cell suspension prepared respectively. Through the analysis of laboratory workflow, it became to apparent that 18S to 20S of the tests were completed by 5:00 p.m., and it required to wait until 3:00 a.m. to complete 90S of the tests. With these results, the early-harvested bacterial cell suspension is applicable to species-identification by RAISUS, but it is necessary to adjust viable cell concentrations to antimicrobial susceptibility test. Also, it is urgent to reconstitute a daily workflow to improve the rapidity of RAISUS test function.
TI  - Activity of moxifloxacin on biofilms produced in vitro by bacterial pathogens involved in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess whether moxifloxacin is able to inhibit the synthesis of and to disrupt biofilms produced in vitro by bacterial pathogens involved in acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. Three strains each of Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli recently isolated from clinical respiratory specimens and capable of slime production were used. Biofilm formation on polystyrene plates was quantified spectrophotometrically by established methodologies. Moxifloxacin (0.5 mg/L) inhibited slime synthesis by >70% in S. aureus, H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae, 45-70% in E. coli and 35-70% in M. catarrhalis. Disruption of pre-formed structures was also promoted by moxifloxacin both for initial (5h) and mature (48 h) biofilms. Drug concentrations reached during therapy (0.5-4 mg/L) resulted in a breakdown of initial biofilm of 60-80% in H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae, 48-86% in S. aureus, 37-69% in M. catarrhalis and 51-71% in E. coli. Mature biofilms were less susceptible to degradation. Moxifloxacin at concentrations that can be achieved in the bronchial mucosa during therapy therefore promotes a significant inhibition of biofilm synthesis and induces slime disruption, a feature that may be instrumental in reducing the exacerbations so frequently observed in this condition.
TI  - Identification of the catalytic subunit of acetohydroxyacid synthase in Haemophilus influenzae and its potent inhibitors.
AB  - Acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS; EC 2.2.1.6) is a thiamin diphosphate- (ThDP)- and FAD-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the first common step in the biosynthetic pathway of the branched-amino acids (BCAAs) leucine, isoleucine, and valine. The gene from Haemophilus influenzae that encodes the AHAS catalytic subunit was cloned, overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), and purified to homogeneity. The purified H. influenzae AHAS catalytic subunit (Hin-AHAS) appeared as a single band on SDS-PAGE gel, with a molecular mass of approximately 63 kDa. The enzyme catalyzes the condensation of two molecules of pyruvate to form acetolactate, with a K(m) of 9.2mM and the specific activity of 1.5 micromol/min/mg. The cofactor activation constant (K(c)=13.5 microM) and the dissociation constant (K(d)=3.3 microM) of ThDP were also determined by enzymatic assay and tryptophan fluorescence quenching studies, respectively. We screened a chemical library to discover new inhibitors of the Hin AHAS catalytic subunit. Through which, AVS-2087 (IC(50)=0.53 microM), KSW30191 (IC(50)=1.42 microM), and KHG20612 (IC(50)=4.91 microM) displayed potent inhibition as compare to sulfometuron methyl (IC(50)=276.31 microM).
TI  - Evidence for a Sav1866-like architecture for the human multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein.
AB  - The recently reported structures of the bacterial multidrug exporter Sav1866 suggest a domain architecture in which both nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) of this ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter contact both transmembrane domains (TMDs). Such a domain arrangement is particularly unexpected because it is not found in the structures of three solute importers BtuCD, HI1470/1, and ModBC from the same protein family. There is also no precedent for such an arrangement from biochemical studies with any ABC transporter. Sav1866 is homologous with the clinically relevant human P-glycoprotein (ABCB1). If the structure proposed for Sav1866 is physiologically relevant, the long intracellular loops of P-glycoprotein TMD2 should contact NBD1. We have tested this by using cysteine mutagenesis and chemical cross-linking to verify proximal relationships of the introduced sulfhydryls across the proposed interdomain interface. We report the first biochemical evidence in support of the domain arrangement proposed for the multidrug resistance class of ABC transporters. With a domain arrangement distinctly different from the three solute importers it seems likely that the TMDs of ABC importers and exporters have evolved different mechanisms to couple to common conformational changes at conserved NBDs.
TI  - Characterization of the dsDNA prophage sequences in the genome of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and visualization of productive bacteriophage.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bioinformatic analysis of the genome sequence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae revealed the presence of nine probable prophage islands. The distribution, conservation and function of many of these sequences, and their ability to produce bacteriophage particles are unknown. RESULTS: Our analysis of the genomic sequence of FA1090 identified five genomic regions (NgoPhi1 - 5) that are related to dsDNA lysogenic phage. The genetic content of the dsDNA prophage sequences were examined in detail and found to contain blocks of genes encoding for proteins homologous to proteins responsible for phage DNA replication, structural proteins and proteins responsible for phage assembly. The DNA sequences from NgoPhi1, NgoPhi2 and NgoPhi3 contain some significant regions of identity. A unique region of NgoPhi2 showed very high similarity with the Pseudomonas aeruginosa generalized transducing phage F116. Comparative analysis at the nucleotide and protein levels suggests that the sequences of NgoPhi1 and NgoPhi2 encode functionally active phages, while NgoPhi3, NgoPhi4 and NgoPhi5 encode incomplete genomes. Expression of the NgoPhi1 and NgoPhi2 repressors in Escherichia coli inhibit the growth of E. coli and the propagation of phage lambda. The NgoPhi2 repressor was able to inhibit transcription of N. gonorrhoeae genes and Haemophilus influenzae HP1 phage promoters. The holin gene of NgoPhi1 (identical to that encoded by NgoPhi2), when expressed in E. coli, could serve as substitute for the phage lambda s gene. We were able to detect the presence of the DNA derived from NgoPhi1 in the cultures of N. gonorrhoeae. Electron microscopy analysis of culture supernatants revealed the presence of multiple forms of bacteriophage particles. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the genes similar to dsDNA lysogenic phage present in the gonococcus are generally conserved in this pathogen and that they are able to regulate the expression of other neisserial genes. Since phage particles were only present in culture supernatants after induction with mitomycin C, it indicates that the gonococcus also regulates the expression of bacteriophage genes.
TI  - Autotransporter proteins: novel targets at the bacterial cell surface.
AB  - Autotransporter proteins constitute a family of outer membrane/secreted proteins  that possess unique structural properties that facilitate their independent transport across the bacterial membrane system and final routing to the cell surface. Autotransporter proteins have been identified in a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria and are often associated with virulence functions such as adhesion, aggregation, invasion, biofilm formation and toxicity. The importance of autotransporter proteins is exemplified by the fact that they constitute an essential component of some human vaccines. Autotransporter proteins contain three structural motifs: a signal sequence, a passenger domain and a translocator domain. Here, the structural properties of the passenger and translocator domains of three type Va autotransporter proteins are compared and contrasted, namely pertactin from Bordetella pertussis, the adhesion and penetration protein (Hap) from Haemophilus influenzae and Antigen 43 (Ag43) from Escherichia coli. The Ag43 protein is described in detail to examine how its structure relates to functional properties such as cell adhesion, aggregation and biofilm formation. The widespread occurrence of autotransporter-encoding genes, their apparent uniform role in virulence and their ability to interact with host cells suggest that they may represent rational targets for the design of novel vaccines directed against Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline (PPI-0903M, T-91825) against bacteria with defined resistance mechanisms and phenotypes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ceftaroline (PPI-0903M, T-91825) is a novel cephalosporin, administered as an N-phosphono prodrug. We investigated its in vitro activity and resistance selection potential. METHODS: MICs were determined by CLSI agar dilution, but with varied inocula. Mutant selection was investigated in single- and multi-step procedures. RESULTS: MICs for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were 0.5-2 mg/L, compared with 0.12-0.25 mg/L for methicillin-susceptible S. aureus; corresponding values for coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.25-2 and 0.06-0.12 mg/L, respectively. Even with 2% NaCl added, all MRSA were susceptible at 2 mg/L. MICs for Enterococcus faecalis were from 0.25 to 8 mg/L; E. faecium was resistant. MICs for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Morganella morganii and Proteeae without acquired resistance were 0.06-0.5 mg/L versus 0.12-1 mg/L for Enterobacter, Serratia and Citrobacter spp. and 2-8 mg/L for Acinetobacter spp. MICs rose to 1-2 mg/L for many Enterobacteriaceae with classical TEM beta-lactamases, and were much higher for those with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), hyperproduced AmpC or K1 enzymes. MICs for strains with classical TEM/SHV beta-lactamases rose if the inoculum was increased to 10(6) cfu/spot; this effect was even more marked for those with ESBLs. Resistance due to Class A beta-lactamases was reversed by clavulanate. Geometric mean MICs were 0.005, 0.05 and 0.09 mg/L for penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, respectively-lower than for any comparator beta-lactam. Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were very susceptible, although with marginally raised MICs for beta-lactamase-positive Moraxella strains and for haemophili with chromosomal ampicillin resistance. Ceftaroline selected AmpC-derepressed Enterobacter mutants similarly to cefotaxime in single-step experiments; in multi-step procedures it selected ESBL variants of blaTEM in E. coli. Resistance selection was not seen with S. aureus, H. influenzae or pneumococci. CONCLUSIONS: Ceftaroline has impressive anti-MRSA and anti-pneumococcal activity. Slight lability to classical TEM and SHV beta-lactamases is exceptional for an oxyimino-cephalosporin, but was reversible with clavulanate, as was the greater resistance mediated by ESBLs. Resistance selection occurred with Enterobacteriaceae, not MRSA.
TI  - Chloramphenicol is a substrate for a novel nitroreductase pathway in Haemophilus  influenzae.
AB  - The p-nitroaromatic antibiotic chloramphenicol has been used extensively to treat life-threatening infections due to Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis; its mechanism of action is the inhibition of protein synthesis. We found that during incubation with H. influenzae cells and lysates, chloramphenicol is converted to a 4-aminophenyl allylic alcohol that lacks antibacterial activity. The allylic alcohol moiety undergoes facile re-addition of water to restore the 1,3-diol, as well as further dehydration driven by the aromatic amine to form the iminoquinone. Several Neisseria species and most chloramphenicol-susceptible Haemophilus species, but not Escherichia coli or other gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria we examined, were also found to metabolize chloramphenicol. The products of chloramphenicol metabolism by species other than H. influenzae have not yet been characterized. The strains reducing the antibiotic were chloramphenicol susceptible, indicating that the pathway does not appear to mediate chloramphenicol resistance. The role of this novel nitroreductase pathway in the physiology of H. influenzae and Neisseria species is unknown. Further understanding of the H. influenzae chloramphenicol reduction pathway will contribute to our knowledge of the diversity of prokaryotic nitroreductase mechanisms.
TI  - Drug-induced conformational changes in multidrug efflux transporter AcrB from Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - In gram-negative bacteria, transporters belonging to the resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) superfamily of proteins are responsible for intrinsic multidrug resistance. Haemophilus influenzae, a gram-negative pathogen causing respiratory diseases in humans and animals, constitutively produces the multidrug efflux transporter AcrB (AcrB(HI)). Similar to other RND transporters AcrB(HI) associates with AcrA(HI), the periplasmic membrane fusion protein, and the outer membrane channel TolC(HI). Here, we report that AcrAB(HI) confers multidrug resistance when expressed in Escherichia coli and requires for its activity the E. coli TolC (TolC(EC)) protein. To investigate the intracellular dynamics of AcrAB(HI), single cysteine mutations were constructed in AcrB(HI) in positions previously identified as important for substrate recognition. The accessibility of these strategically positioned cysteines to the hydrophilic thiol-reactive fluorophore fluorescein-5-maleimide (FM) was studied in vivo in the presence of various substrates of AcrAB(HI) and in the presence or absence of AcrA(HI) and TolC(EC). We report that the reactivity of specific cysteines with FM is affected by the presence of some but not all substrates. Our results suggest that substrates induce conformational changes in AcrB(HI).
TI  - Characterization of protomer interfaces in HslV protease; the bacterial homologue of 20S proteasome.
AB  - HslVU, a two-component proteasome-related prokaryotic system is composed of HslV  protease and HslU ATPase. HslV protomers assemble in a dodecamer of two-stacked hexameric rings that form a complex with HslU hexamers. The intra- and inter-ring protomer interfaces in the HslV dodecamer underpin the integrity and functionality of HslVU. Structural characterization of HslV from different bacteria illustrated considerable differences in interacting residues, accessible surface and gap volumes at the intra-ring interface that is primarily stabilized by polar interactions. Amino acid residues Lys28, Arg83 and Asp111 have envisaged as hot spots at this HslU-interacting interface. The inter-ring interfaces that are made up of side chain packing of hydrophobic residues are structurally conserved. Hyperthermostable bacterium T. maritima HslV has extensively networked polar/nonpolar interactions and highly packed environment at all interfaces. Present data demonstrates that HslV protomer interfaces perform distinct functions; whereas intra-ring interface participates in HslV:HslU interaction resulting in allosteric activation of HslV protease by HslU, the inter-ring interfaces uphold the oligomeric form of HslV.
TI  - Synthesis of globopentaose using a novel beta1,3-galactosyltransferase activity of the Haemophilus influenzae beta1,3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase LgtD.
AB  - We have previously described a bacterial system for the conversion of globotriaose (Gb3) into globotetraose (Gb4) by a metabolically engineered Escherichia coli strain expressing the Haemophilus influenzae lgtD gene encoding beta1,3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase [Antoine, T., Bosso, C., Heyraud, A. Samain, E. (2005) Large scale in vivo synthesis of globotriose and globotetraose by high cell density culture of metabolically engineered Escherichia coli. Biochimie 87, 197-203]. Here, we found that LgtD has an additional beta1,3-galactosyltransferase activity which allows our bacterial system to be extended to the synthesis of the carbohydrate portion of globopentaosylceramide (Galbeta-3GalNAcbeta-3Galalpha-4Galbeta-4Glc) which reacts with the monoclonal antibody defining the stage-specific embryonic antigen-3. In vitro assays confirmed that LgtD had both beta1,3-GalT and beta1,3-GalNAcT activities and showed that differences in the affinity for Gb3 and Gb4 explain the specific and exclusive formation of globopentaose.
TI  - Rebuilding microbial genomes.
AB  - Engineered microbes are of great potential utility in biotechnology and basic research. In principle, a cell can be built from scratch by assembling small molecule sets with auto-catalytic properties. Alternatively, DNA can be isolated or directly synthesized and molded into a synthetic genome using existing genomic blueprints and molecular biology tools. Activating such a synthetic genome will yield a synthetic cell. Here we examine obstacles associated with this latter approach using a model system whereby a donor genome from H. influenzae is fragmented, and the pieces are then modified and reassembled stepwise in an E. coli host cell. There are obstacles associated with this strategy related to DNA transfer, DNA replication, cross-talk in gene regulation and compatibility of gene products between donor and host. Encouragingly, analysis of gene expression indicates widespread transcription of H. influenzae genes in E. coli, and analysis of gap locations in H. influenzae and other microbial genome assemblies reveals few genes routinely incompatible with E. coli. In conclusion, rebuilding and booting a genome remains a feasible and pragmatic approach to creating a synthetic microbial cell.
TI  - The Haemophilus influenzae hFbpABC Fe3+ transporter: analysis of the membrane permease and development of a gallium-based screen for mutants.
AB  - The obligate human pathogen Haemophilus influenzae utilizes a siderophore-independent (free) Fe(3+) transport system to obtain this essential element from the host iron-binding protein transferrin. The hFbpABC transporter is a binding protein-dependent ABC transporter that functions to shuttle (free) Fe(3+) through the periplasm and across the inner membrane of H. influenzae. This investigation focuses on the structure and function of the hFbpB membrane permease component of the transporter, a protein that has eluded prior characterization. Based on multiple-sequence alignments between permease orthologs, a series of site-directed mutations targeted at residues within the two conserved permease motifs were generated. The hFbpABC transporter was expressed in a siderophore-deficient Escherichia coli background, and effects of mutations were analyzed using growth rescue and radiolabeled (55)Fe(3+) transport assays. Results demonstrate that mutation of the invariant glycine (G418A) within motif 2 led to attenuated transport activity, while mutation of the invariant glycine (G155A/V/E) within motif 1 had no discernible effect on activity. Individual mutations of well-conserved leucines (L154D and L417D) led to attenuated and null transport activities, respectively. As a complement to site-directed methods, a mutant screen based on resistance to the toxic iron analog gallium, an hFbpABC inhibitor, was devised. The screen led to the identification of several significant hFbpB mutations; V497I, I174F, and S475I led to null transport activities, while S146Y resulted in attenuated activity. Significant residues were mapped to a topological model of the hFbpB permease, and the implications of mutations are discussed in light of structural and functional data from related ABC transporters.
TI  - VapC-1 of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae is a ribonuclease.
AB  - Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) organisms are obligate parasites of the human upper respiratory tract that can exist as commensals or pathogens. Toxin-antitoxin (TA) loci are highly conserved gene pairs that encode both a toxin and antitoxin moiety. Seven TA gene families have been identified to date, and NTHi carries two alleles of the vapBC family. Here, we have characterized the function of one of the NTHi alleles, vapBC-1. The gene pair is transcribed as an operon in two NTHi clinical isolates, and promoter fusions display an inverse relationship to culture density. The antitoxin VapB-1 forms homomultimers both in vitro and in vivo. The expression of the toxin VapC-1 conferred growth inhibition to an Escherichia coli expression strain and was successfully purified only when cloned in tandem with its cognate antitoxin. Using total RNA isolated from both E. coli and NTHi, we show for the first time that VapC-1 is an RNase that is active on free RNA but does not degrade DNA in vitro. Preincubation of the purified toxin and antitoxin together results in the formation of a protein complex that abrogates the activity of the toxin. We conclude that the NTHi vapBC-1 gene pair functions as a classical TA locus and that the induction of VapC-1 RNase activity leads to growth inhibition via the mechanism of mRNA cleavage.
TI  - Comparative in vitro antimicrobial activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline compound, in freshly prepared medium and quality control.
AB  - The in vitro spectra of activity of tigecycline and tetracycline were determined  for 2,490 bacterial isolates representing 50 different species or phenotypic groups. All isolates were tested simultaneously by broth microdilution using freshly prepared Mueller-Hinton broth and by disk diffusion. Portions of these data were submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in support of the sponsor's application for new drug approval. In a separate study, MIC and disk diffusion quality control ranges were determined. The tigecycline MICs at which 50%/90% of bacteria were inhibited were (in microg/ml) as follows: for Streptococcus spp., 0.06/0.12; for Moraxella catarrhalis, 0.06/0.12; for Staphylococcus spp., 0.12/0.25; for Enterococcus spp., 0.12/0.25; for Listeria monocytogenes, 0.12/0.12; for Neisseria meningitidis, 0.12/0.25; for Haemophilus spp., 0.25/0.5; for Enterobacteriaceae, 0.05/2.0; for non-Enterobacteriaceae, 0.5/8.0. Tigecycline was consistently more potent than tetracycline against all species studied. The data from this study confirm the FDA-approved MIC and disk diffusion breakpoints for tigecycline for Streptococcus spp. other than Streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococci, and Enterobacteriaceae. Provisional breakpoints for Haemophilus spp. and S. pneumoniae are proposed based on the data from this study. The following MIC and/or disk diffusion quality control ranges are proposed: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml; S. aureus ATCC 25923, 20 to 25 mm; Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml and 20 to 27 mm; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, 9 to 13 mm, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, 0.03 to 0.12 microg/ml; S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619, 0.015 to 0.12 microg/ml and 23 to 29 mm; Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247, 0.06 to 0.5 microg/ml and 23 to 31 mm; and Neisseria gonorrhoeae ATCC 49226, 30 to 40 mm.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from ophthalmic specimens between 1984 and 2005 in Zurich, Switzerland.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing resistance of bacteria cultured from ophthalmic specimens  to antibiotic therapy has been documented worldwide. Inappropriate prescribing practices are thought to represent a major risk factor for antibiotic resistance. This study investigates the pattern of bacterial antibiotic susceptibility in Zurich, Switzerland over a period of twenty years. METHODS: Antibiotic susceptibilities of bacterial isolates from all ophthalmic specimens cultured at the Institute of Medical Microbiology in Zurich between 1984 and 2005 were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: A total of 7,862 ocular surface samples have been collected. 3,010 specimens (38.3 %) were positive for aerobic bacteria. The strains isolated most frequently were Staphylococcus aureus (23.9 %), coagulase-negative staphylococci (16.1 %), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.0 %), Haemophilus influenzae (6.3 %), Escherichia coli (5.1 %), Serratia marcescens (4.7 %), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (3.9 %). Various bacteria accounted for the remaining 30.0 %. Susceptibility of these strains to the aminoglycosides, quinolones, and cephalosporins tested did not change over this period of time. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that bacteria cultured from ophthalmic specimens in Zurich, Switzerland have not changed their pattern of antibiotic susceptibility over the past 20 years.
TI  - Generalized correlation functions and their applications in selection of optimal  multiple spaced seeds for homology search.
AB  - The Goulden-Jackson cluster method is a powerful method to calculate the probability of occurrences of a pattern or set of patterns in a sequence. If the patterns contain wildcard characters, however, the size of the connector matrix grows exponentially with the number of wildcards. Here we show that average correlation c(z) is a good predicator of hitting probability q (n), and the generalized correlation function c(z) can be used to approximate c(z) efficiently. We apply the method to the problem of optimal multiple spaced seed selection for homology search. We reexamine the concept of optimal sensitivity of spaced seeds and show that it is better to select optimal seeds based on some average properties, such as c(1), which is the expectation of the first hitting length. Higher order approximations can also be constructed easily. Tests on arbitrary large genomic data with multiple seeds show that the optimal multiple seeds selected by the methods are indeed more sensitive. The methods provide a theoretical background on which various empirical observations can be unified and further heuristic search methods can be developed.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - Moraxella catarrhalis strain O35E expresses two filamentous hemagglutinin-like proteins that mediate adherence to human epithelial cells.
AB  - Two-partner secretion (TPS) systems are a family of proteins being rapidly identified and characterized in a growing number of gram-negative bacteria. TPS systems mediate the secretion of proteins, many involved in virulence traits such as hemolysis, adherence to epithelial cells, inhibition of bacterial growth, and immunomodulation of the host. A TPS system typically consists of a transporter located in the bacterial outer membrane (OM) which is responsible for the recognition and secretion of at least one large exoprotein. Two of the better-characterized TPS systems specify the Bordetella pertussis FHA and Haemophilus influenzae HMW1/HMW2 proteins. We identified three gene products of Moraxella catarrhalis strain O35E that resemble TPS proteins and designated them MhaC (transporter), MhaB1 (exoprotein), and MhaB2 (exoprotein). Western blot analysis using anti-MhaC, or antibodies reacting to both MhaB1 and MhaB2 (MhaB-reactive), revealed that these antigens are expressed in the OM of 63% of isolates tested. Mutations in the mhaC gene specifying the putative transporter of the M. catarrhalis wild-type strains O35E, O12E, and McGHS1 resulted in the absence of MhaB1/MhaB2 in the OM of mutants. These results are therefore consistent with the Mha proteins functioning as a TPS system. Furthermore, we discovered that these mhaC mutants exhibit markedly decreased binding to human epithelial cells relevant to pathogenesis by M. catarrhalis (Chang, HEp2, A549, and/or 16HBE14o(-)). Expression of O12E MhaC and MhaB1 in a nonadherent strain of Escherichia coli was found to increase the adherence of recombinant bacteria to HEp2 monolayers by sevenfold, thereby demonstrating that this M. catarrhalis TPS system directly mediates binding to human epithelial cells. The construction of isogenic mutants in the mhaB1 and mhaB2 genes of strain O35E also suggests that the MhaB proteins play distinct roles in M. catarrhalis adherence.
TI  - Coniothyrione, a chlorocyclopentandienylbenzopyrone as a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor discovered by antisense technology.
AB  - Bacterial protein synthesis inhibitors interact mainly with rRNA and to some extent ribosomal proteins, which are potential targets for developing new antibacterial agents. Specifically, the ribosomal protein S4 of the 30s ribosomal subunit known as ribosomal protein small-subunit D (rpsD) may be useful as a target. The antisense-rpsD gene-sensitized two-plate assay led to the discovery of a novel chlorinated cyclopentandienylbenzopyrone antibiotic, coniothyrione, C14H9ClO6, isolated from Coniothyrium cerealis MF7209. It exhibited liquid MICs of 16-32 microg/mL against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis and >64 microg/mL against Escherichia coli. Isolation, structure elucidation, and antibacterial activity of coniothyrione are described.
TI  - [In-vitro susceptibilites to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 18,639 clinical isolates obtained from 77 centers in 2004].
AB  - A total of 18,639 clinical isolates in 19 species collected from 77 centers during 2004 in Japan were tested for their susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (FQs) and other selected antibiotics. The common respiratory pathogens, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae showed a high susceptible rate against FQs. The isolation rate of beta lactamase non-producing ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae was approximately three times as large as those of western countries. Most strains of Enterobacteriaceae were also susceptible to FQs. The resistance rate of Escherichia coli against FQs has however been rapidly increasing so far as we surveyed since 1994. The FQs-resistant rate in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) showed approximately 90% except for 36%. of sitafloxacin while FQs-resistant rate in methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) was around 5%. The FQs-resistant rate of methicillin-resistant coagulase negative Staphylococci (MRCNS) was also higher than that of methicillin-susceptible coagulase negative Staphylococci (MSCNS), however, it was lower than that of MRSA. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates, 32-34% from UTI and 15-19% of from RTI was resistant to FQs. Acinetobacter spp. showed a high susceptibility to FQs. Although FQs-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae have not been increased in western countries, it is remarkably high in Japan. In this survey, isolates of approximately 85% was resistant to FQs.
TI  - Altered tethering of the SspB adaptor to the ClpXP protease causes changes in substrate delivery.
AB  - SspB is a dimeric adaptor protein that increases the rate at which ssrA-tagged substrates are degraded by tethering them to the ClpXP protease. Each SspB subunit consists of a folded domain that forms the dimer interface and a flexible C-terminal tail. Ternary delivery complexes are stabilized by three sets of tethering interactions. The C-terminal XB peptide of each SspB subunit binds ClpX, the body of SspB binds one part of the ssrA-tag sequence, and ClpX binds another part of the tag. To test the functional importance of these tethering interactions, we engineered monomeric SspB variants and dimeric variants with different length linkers between the SspB body and the XB peptide and employed substrates with degradation tags that bind ClpX weakly and/or contain extensions between the binding sites for SspB and ClpX. We find that monomeric SspB variants can enhance ClpXP degradation of a subset of substrates, that doubling the number of tethering interactions stimulates degradation via changes in Km and Vmax, and that major alterations in the length of the 48-residue SspB linker cause only small changes in the efficiency of substrate delivery. These results indicate that the properties of the degradation tag and the number of SspB.ClpX tethering interactions are the major factors that determine the extent to which the substrate and ClpX are engaged in ternary delivery complexes.
TI  - [In vitro study to evaluate the antibacterial activity of a combination of the haulm of nasturtium (Tropaeoli majoris herba) and of the roots of horseradish (Armoraciae rusticanae radix)].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the in-vitro antimicrobial properties of a commercialized  preparation (Angocin Anti-Infekt N) containing a combination of the haulm of nasturtium (Tropaeoli majoris herba; N) and of the roots of horseradish (Armoraciae rusticanae radix; H). This preparation can be used to treat upper respiratory tract (URTI) and urinary tract infections (UTI). The active ingredients are volatile mustard oils, which are activated in the gastrointestinal tract after oral intake. Previous research has shown mustard oils derived from either N or H to possess antibacterial activity. METHODS: In order to assess the antimicrobial capacity of phytotherapeutic compounds containing volatile mustard oils, a modified gas-test was used. Native preparations of N and H were applied to the lids of Columbia agar plates (ratio N:H = 2.5:1) and mixed with sterile H20. Thirteen different bacterial species including Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible and resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, MRSA) were tested (20 isolates each). The test organisms were plated onto the blood agar plates and placed above the native preparations. The plates were sealed with adhesive tape and incubated at 37 degrees C. Following incubation of 24 h and 92 h, colony forming units (CFU) were counted and the minimal inhibitory concentrationg (MIC90) was determined for each bacterial species. RESULTS: Relevant antimicrobial activities of the combined native preparations were found against H. influenzae (MIC90 50 mg N / 20 mg H), M. catarrhalis (100 mg N / 40 mg H), E. coli (400 mg N / 160 mg H), P aeruginosa (400 mg N / 160 mg H), MSSA (400 mg N 1 160 mg H), MRSA (400 mg N / 160 mg H), and S. pyogenes (400 mg N / 160 mg H). CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial testing of a combination of N and H revealed broad antibacterial activities against clinically relevant pathogens covering both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, thus confirming previous reports of the antibacterial properties of mustard oils. Additionally, this study demonstrated that the combination of N and H leads to synergistic activity in terms of improved Pseudomonas-susceptibility compared to the previous reported activities of the single compounds. Thus, these results prove that there is a rational basis for treatment of URTI and UTI with a combination of N and H.
TI  - Reduced susceptibility of Haemophilus influenzae to the peptide deformylase inhibitor LBM415 can result from target protein overexpression due to amplified chromosomal def gene copy number.
AB  - Previous genetic analysis of Haemophilus influenzae revealed two mechanisms associated with decreased susceptibility to the novel peptide deformylase inhibitor LBM415: AcrAB-TolC-mediated efflux and Fmt bypass, resulting from mutations in the pump repressor gene acrR and in the fmt gene, respectively. We have isolated an additional mutant, CDS23 (LBM415 MIC, 64 microg/ml versus 4 microg/ml against the parent strain NB65044) that lacks mutations in the acrR or fmt structural genes or in the gene encoding Def, the intracellular target of LBM415. Western immunoblot analysis, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and tryptic digestion combined with mass spectrometric identification showed that the Def protein was highly overexpressed in the mutant strain. Consistent with this, real-time reverse transcription-PCR revealed a significant increase in def transcript titer. No mutations were found in the region upstream of def that might account for altered expression; however, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis suggested that a genetic rearrangement of the region containing def had occurred. Using a combination of PCR, sequencing, and Southern blot analyses, it was determined that the def gene had undergone copy number amplification, explaining the high level of target protein expression. Inactivation of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump in this mutant increased susceptibility 16-fold, highlighting the role of efflux in exacerbating the overall reduced susceptibility resulting from target overexpression.
TI  - The crystal structure of the rhomboid peptidase from Haemophilus influenzae provides insight into intramembrane proteolysis.
AB  - Rhomboid peptidases are members of a family of regulated intramembrane peptidases that cleave the transmembrane segments of integral membrane proteins. Rhomboid peptidases have been shown to play a major role in developmental processes in Drosophila and in mitochondrial maintenance in yeast. Most recently, the function of rhomboid peptidases has been directly linked to apoptosis. We have solved the structure of the rhomboid peptidase from Haemophilus influenzae (hiGlpG) to 2.2-A resolution. The phasing for the crystals of hiGlpG was provided mainly by molecular replacement, by using the coordinates of the Escherichia coli rhomboid (ecGlpG). The structural results on these rhomboid peptidases have allowed us to speculate on the catalytic mechanism of substrate cleavage in a membranous environment. We have identified the relative disposition of the nucleophilic serine to the general base/acid function of the conserved histidine. Modeling a tetrapeptide substrate in the context of the rhomboid structure reveals an oxyanion hole comprising the side chain of a second conserved histidine and the main-chain NH of the nucleophilic serine residue. In both hiGlpG and ecGlpG structures, a water molecule occupies this oxyanion hole.
TI  - [Antimicrobial resistance surveillance: VIRA STUDY 2006].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to determine the current antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the most frequent multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the two VIRA studies carried out in 2001 and 2004. METHODS: In February 2006, the 40 participating hospitals sent the following microorganisms: non-penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (92), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (290), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (136), ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (89), ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae (67), ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli (365), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (181), and Acinetobacter baumannii (92). The hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. Susceptibility was determined with a broth microdilution method. RESULTS: Among the non-penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae isolates, the proportion of those ones resistant to this antibiotic showed a significant (p < 0.001) decrease (59.8% in 2001, 30.2% in 2004 and 14.3% in 2006). Among MRSA, we detected one isolate nonsusceptible to linezolid, four resistant to quinupristin-dalfopristin and one strain with a vancomycin MIC of 4 microg/mL. The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli was 12.1%. Resistance of A. baumannii to imipenem varied from 27% in the 2001-2004 period to 47.8% in 2006 (p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: These results again emphasize that resistance surveillance systems are an important tool for preventing the emergence and spread of multi-resistant pathogens.
TI  - A comparison of the folding of two knotted proteins: YbeA and YibK.
AB  - The extraordinary topology of proteins belonging to the alpha/beta-knot superfamily of proteins is unexpected, due to the apparent complexities involved in the formation of a deep trefoil knot in a polypeptide backbone. Despite this, an increasing number of knotted structures are being identified; how such proteins fold remains a mystery. Studies on the dimeric protein YibK from Haemophilus influenzae have led to the characterisation of its folding pathway in some detail. To complement research into the folding of YibK, and to address whether folding pathways are conserved for members of the alpha/beta-knot superfamily, the structurally similar knotted protein YbeA from Escherichia coli has been studied. A comprehensive thermodynamic and kinetic analysis of the folding of YbeA is presented here, and compared to that of YibK. Both fold via an intermediate state populated under equilibrium conditions that is monomeric and considerably structured. The unfolding/refolding kinetics of YbeA are simpler than those found for YibK and involve two phases attributed to the formation of a monomeric intermediate state and a dimerisation step. In contrast to YibK, a change in the rate-determining step on the unfolding pathway for YbeA is observed with a changing concentration of urea. Despite this difference, both proteins fold by a mechanism involving at least one sequential monomeric intermediate that has properties similar to that observed during the equilibrium unfolding. The rate of dimerisation observed for YbeA and YibK is very similar, as is the rate constant for formation of the kinetic monomeric intermediate that precedes dimerisation. The findings suggest that relatively slow folding and dimerisation may be common attributes of knotted proteins.
TI  - The role of the synergistic phosphate anion in iron transport by the periplasmic  iron-binding protein from Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The acquisition of iron from transferrin by Gram-negative bacterial pathogens is  dependent on a periplasmic ferric-ion-binding protein, FbpA. FbpA shuttles iron from the outer membrane to an inner membrane transport complex. A bound phosphate anion completes the iron co-ordination shell of FbpA and kinetic studies demonstrate that the anion plays a critical role in iron binding and release in vitro. The present study was initiated to directly address the hypothesis that the synergistic anion is required for transport of iron in intact cells. A series of site-directed mutants in the anion-binding amino acids of the Haemophilus influenzae FbpA (Gln-58, Asn-175 and Asn-193) were prepared to provide proteins defective in binding of the phosphate anion. Crystal structures of various mutants have revealed that alteration of the C-terminal domain ligands (Asn-175 or Asn-193) but not the N-terminal domain ligand (Gln-58) abrogated binding of the phosphate anion. The mutant proteins were introduced into H. influenzae to evaluate their ability to mediate iron transport. All of the single site-directed mutants (Q58L, N175L and N193L) were capable of mediating iron acquisition from transferrin and from limiting concentrations of ferric citrate. The results suggest that the transport of iron by FbpA is not dependent on binding of phosphate in the synergistic anion-binding site.
TI  - Structure of Escherichia coli UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl:L-alanine ligase (MurC).
AB  - The bacterial cell wall provides essential protection from the external environment and confers strength and rigidity to counteract internal osmotic pressure. Without this layer the cell would be easily ruptured and it is for this reason that biosynthetic pathways leading to the formation of peptidoglycan have for many years been a prime target for effective antibiotics. Central to this pathway are four similar ligase enzymes which add peptide groups to glycan moieties. As part of a program to better understand the structure-function relationships in these four enzymes, the crystal structure of Escherichia coli UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl:L-alanine ligase (MurC) has been determined to 2.6 A resolution. The structure was solved by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction methods from a single selenomethionine-substituted crystal and refined to a crystallographic R factor of 0.212 (R(free) = 0.259). The enzyme has a modular multi-domain structure very similar to those of other members of the mur family of ATP-dependent amide-bond ligases. Detailed comparison of these four enzymes shows that considerable conformational changes are possible. These changes, together with the recruitment of two different N-terminal domains, allow this family of enzymes to bind a substrate which is identical at one end and at the other has the growing peptide tail which will ultimately become part of the rigid bacterial cell wall. Comparison of the E. coli and Haemophilus influenzae structures and analysis of the sequences of known MurC enzymes indicate the presence of a ;dimerization' motif in almost 50% of the MurC enzymes and points to a highly conserved loop in domain 3 that may play a key role in amino-acid ligand specificity.
TI  - Pneumocystis jirovecii and microbiological findings in children with severe pneumonia in Nairobi, Kenya.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the significance of Pneumocystis jirovecii infection in the Kenyan paediatric population. DESIGN: Sixty samples of induced sputum from children aged < or =23 months, half of whom were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive, admitted with severe pneumonia in Nairobi were subjected to immunofluorescent staining for detection of P. jirovecii and microbiological culture. RESULTS: P. jirovecii was detected in 8/60 (13%) as a copathogen with other respiratory pathogens. Five of eight samples with >5 oocysts were from HIV-positive children aged < or =6 months, while equivocally scored samples (< or =5 oocysts) were from HIV-negative children aged >6 months. Klebsiella pneumoniae was significantly recovered in 26/ 60 (43%), followed by Escherichia coli 11/60 (18%) and Staphylococcus aureus 8/60 (13%). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated infrequently. Candida albicans was recovered from 27/60 (45%), while the frequency of C. tropicalis, C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis was 7%, 5% and 3% respectively. Multidrug resistance among E. coli and K. pneumoniae were: sulphamethoxazoletrimethoprim 100% vs. 69%, chloramphenicol 55% vs. 73% and ampicillin 100% vs. 89%. CONCLUSION: Paediatricians in Kenya should be aware of Pneumocystis pneumonia, irrespective of the patient's HIV status.
TI  - Acetylated flavanone glycosides from the rhizomes of Cyclosorus acuminatus.
AB  - Six new flavanone glycosides (1-6) were isolated from the methanol extract of the rhizomes of Cyclosorus acuminatus, together with the parent flavanone glycoside 2a. Their structures were established on the basis of spectroscopic and chemical methods. All compounds showed moderate activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae.
TI  - Dual targeting of GyrB and ParE by a novel aminobenzimidazole class of antibacterial compounds.
AB  - A structure-guided drug design approach was used to optimize a novel series of aminobenzimidazoles that inhibit the essential ATPase activities of bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV and that show potent activities against a variety of bacterial pathogens. Two such compounds, VRT-125853 and VRT-752586, were characterized for their target specificities and preferences in bacteria. In metabolite incorporation assays, VRT-125853 inhibited both DNA and RNA synthesis but had little effect on protein synthesis. Both compounds inhibited the maintenance of negative supercoils in plasmid DNA in Escherichia coli at the MIC. Sequencing of DNA corresponding to the GyrB and ParE ATP-binding regions in VRT-125853- and VRT-752586-resistant mutants revealed that their primary target in Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae was GyrB, whereas in Streptococcus pneumoniae it was ParE. In Enterococcus faecalis, the primary target of VRT-125853 was ParE, whereas for VRT-752586 it was GyrB. DNA transformation experiments with H. influenzae and S. aureus proved that the mutations observed in gyrB resulted in decreased susceptibilities to both compounds. Novobiocin resistance-conferring mutations in S. aureus, H. influenzae, and S. pneumoniae were found in gyrB, and these mutants showed little or no cross-resistance to VRT-125853 or VRT-752586 and vice versa. Furthermore, gyrB and parE double mutations increased the MICs of VRT-125853 and VRT-752586 significantly, providing evidence of dual targeting. Spontaneous frequencies of resistance to VRT-752586 were below detectable levels (<5.2x10(-10)) for wild-type E. faecalis but were significantly elevated for strains containing single and double target-based mutations, demonstrating that dual targeting confers low levels of resistance emergence and the maintenance of susceptibility in vitro.
TI  - Identification of a bifunctional lipopolysaccharide sialyltransferase in Haemophilus influenzae: incorporation of disialic acid.
AB  - The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) can be substituted at various positions by N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). LPS sialylation plays an important role in pathogenesis. The only LPS sialyltransferase characterized biochemically to date in H. influenzae is Lic3A, an alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase responsible for the addition of Neu5Ac to a lactose acceptor (Hood, D. W., Cox, A. D., Gilbert, M., Makepeace, K., Walsh, S., Deadman, M. E., Cody, A., Martin, A., Mansson, M., Schweda, E. K., Brisson, J. R., Richards, J. C., Moxon, E. R., and Wakarchuk, W. W. (2001) Mol. Microbiol. 39, 341-350). Here we describe a second sialyltransferase, Lic3B, that is a close homologue of Lic3A and present in 60% of NTHi isolates tested. A recombinant form of Lic3B was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography. We used synthetic fluorescent acceptors with a terminal lactose or sialyllactose to show that Lic3B has both alpha-2,3- and alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase activities. Structural analysis of LPS from lic3B mutant strains of NTHi confirmed that only monosialylated species were detectable, whereas disialylated species were detected upon inactivation of lic3A. Furthermore, introduction of lic3B into a lic3B-deficient strain background resulted in a significant increase in sialylation in the recipient strain. Mass spectrometric analysis of LPS indicated that glycoforms containing two Neu5Ac residues were evident that were not present in the LPS of the parent strain. These findings characterize the activity of a second sialyltransferase in H. influenzae, responsible for the addition of di-sialic acid to the LPS. Modification of the LPS by di-sialylation conferred increased resistance of the organism to the killing effects of normal human serum, as compared with mono-sialylated or non-sialylated species, indicating that this modification has biological significance.
TI  - Non-canonical CRP sites control competence regulons in Escherichia coli and many  other gamma-proteobacteria.
AB  - Escherichia coli's cAMP receptor protein (CRP), the archetypal bacterial transcription factor, regulates over a hundred promoters by binding 22 bp symmetrical sites with the consensus core half-site TGTGA. However, Haemophilus influenzae has two types of CRP sites, one like E.coli's and one with the core sequence TGCGA that regulates genes required for DNA uptake (natural competence). Only the latter 'CRP-S' sites require both CRP and the coregulator Sxy for activation. To our knowledge, the TGTGA and TGCGA motifs are the first example of one transcription factor having two distinct binding-site motifs. Here we show that CRP-S promoters are widespread in the gamma-proteobacteria and demonstrate their Sxy-dependence in E.coli. Orthologs of most H.influenzae CRP-S-regulated genes are ubiquitous in the five best-studied gamma-proteobacteria families, Enterobacteriaceae, Pasteurellaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, Vibrionaceae and Xanthomonadaceae. Phylogenetic footprinting identified CRP-S sites in the promoter regions of the Enterobacteriaceae, Pasteurellaceae and Vibrionaceae orthologs, and canonical CRP sites in orthologs of genes known to be Sxy-independent in H.influenzae. Bandshift experiments confirmed that E.coli CRP-S sequences are low affinity binding sites for CRP, and mRNA analysis showed that they require CRP, cAMP (CRP's allosteric effector) and Sxy for gene induction. This work suggests not only that the gamma-proteobacteria share a common DNA uptake mechanism, but also that, in the three best studied families, their competence regulons share both CRP-S specificity and Sxy dependence.
TI  - [Pathogenic bacteria of childhood lower respiratory tract infection].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the pathogenic bacteria of lower respiratory tract infection  (LRTI), and age and gender distribution and drug resistance of the pathogenic bacteria in children. METHODS: Sputum specimens for bacterial cultures were collected in sterile tubes from all of the children with LRTI who had been admitted to the Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University between August 2001 and July 2002. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed using the Vitek system, the Kirby-Bauer diffuse method and the Etest method after bacteria were identified. RESULTS: Among the 4,238 patients with LRTI during the study period, 1,181 patients were bacteria-positive, with a positive rate of 27.9%. Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) was the most common (222 strains), followed by Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) (216 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) (216 strains), Escherichia coil (E. coli) (169 strains) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (89 strains). The isolation rate of S. pneumoniae in females was significantly higher than in males (6.2% vs 4.7%; P < 0.05). However, the isolation rates of K. pneumoniae and S. aureus in males were higher than in females (5.1% vs 4.1% and 2.5% vs 1.5%, respectively; P < 0.05). A higher incidence of LRTI due to S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae was found in the 1-3 years group, while the incidence of LRTI due to K. pneumoniae, E. coli, S. aureus and E. cloacae was higher in patients under 1 year of age. Antibiotic susceptibility tests showed that rates of penicillin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae, ampicillin resistant H. influenzae, oxacillin-resistant S. aureus and ESBL-positive K. pneumoniae and E. coli were 55.0%, 16.5%, 41.2%, 42.6% and 4.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, K. pneumoniae, E. coli and S. aureus were common pathogens of LRTI in children. The infection rate varied with age and gender. Antibiotics for treating LRTI should be selected based on the drug susceptibility test.
TI  - Functional characterization of the competence protein DprA/Smf in Escherichia coli.
AB  - In several bacterial species that show natural transformation, dprA has been described as a competence gene. The DprA protein has been suggested to be involved in the protection of incoming DNA. However, members of the dprA gene family (also called smf) can be detected in virtually all bacterial species, which suggests that their gene products have a more general function. We examined the function of the DprA/Smf homologue of Escherichia coli. Escherichia coli dprA/smf is able to partially restore transformation in a Haemophilus influenzae dprA mutant, which shows that dprA/smf genes from competent and noncompetent species are interchangeable with respect to their involvement in natural transformation. From this, we conclude that natural transformation is probably an additional function of these genes. Subsequently, the dprA/smf gene was deleted in various recombination mutants of E. coli, and the resultant phenotype was tested. All the resultant E. coli dprA/smf mutants did not differ from their parent strains with respect to transformation, Hfr-conjugation, recombination and DNA repair. Therefore, a role of DprA/Smf in DNA recombination could not be established and the basic function of dprA/smf remains unclear.
TI  - Sites of interaction of a precursor polypeptide on the export chaperone SecB mapped by site-directed spin labeling.
AB  - Export of protein into the periplasm of Escherichia coli via the general secretory system requires that the transported polypeptides be devoid of stably folded tertiary structure. Capture of the precursor polypeptides before they fold is achieved by the promiscuous binding to the chaperone SecB. SecB delivers its ligand to export sites through its specific binding to SecA, a peripheral component of the membrane translocon. At the translocon the ligand is passed from SecB to SecA and subsequently through the SecYEG channel. We have previously used site-directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to establish a docking model between SecB and SecA. Here we report use of the same strategy to map the pathway of a physiologic ligand, the unfolded form of precursor galactose-binding protein, on SecB. Our set of SecB variants each containing a single cysteine, which was used in the previous study, has been expanded to 48 residues, which cover 49% of the surface of SecB. The residues on SecB involved in contacts were identified as those that, upon addition of the unfolded polypeptide ligand, showed changes in spectral line shape consistent with restricted motion of the nitroxide. We conclude that the bound precursor makes contact with a large portion of the surface of the small chaperone. The sites on SecB that interact with the ligand are compared with the previously identified sites that interact with SecA and a model for transfer of the ligand is discussed.
TI  - Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) chromosome contains a group II capsular gene cluster.
AB  - During our study of de novo synthesis of Escherichia coli K1 capsular polysaccharides, we found that E. coli BL21(DE3) has a capsular gene cluster, similar to those of group II capsular E. coli strains. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the E. coli BL21(DE3) gene cluster showed homologues to all group II regions 1 and 3 genes and the presence of an IS1 element in one of the region 2 ORFs, which likely prevents capsule expression. Complementation analysis showed that region 1 and 3 genes encode functional proteins that are sufficient for the export of newly synthesized polysaccharide. The gene products of Bl21(DE3) kpsC and kpsS supported in vitro de novo synthesis of K1 polysaccharide when co-expressed with K1 NeuE and NeuS. Sequence homology between BL21(DE3) region 2 open reading frames and capsule-related genes in other bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae serotype b, suggests that the encapsulated ancestor of BL21(DE3) may have produced a ribose/ribitol-phosphate containing polysaccharide.
TI  - Role of N-acetylglucosamine within core lipopolysaccharide of several species of  gram-negative bacteria in targeting the DC-SIGN (CD209).
AB  - Our recent studies have shown that the dendritic cell-specific ICAM nonintegrin CD209 (DC-SIGN) specifically binds to the core LPS of Escherichia coli K12 (E. coli), promoting bacterial adherence and phagocytosis. In this current study, we attempted to map the sites within the core LPS that are directly involved in LPS-DC-SIGN interaction. We took advantage of four sets of well-defined core LPS mutants, which are derived from E. coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Haemophilus ducreyi and determined interaction of each of these four sets with DC-SIGN. Our results demonstrated that N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) sugar residues within the core LPS in these bacteria play an essential role in targeting the DC-SIGN receptor. Our results also imply that DC-SIGN is an innate immune receptor and the interaction of bacterial core LPS and DC-SIGN may represent a primeval interaction between Gram-negative bacteria and host phagocytic cells.
TI  - Assessment of pathogen frequency and resistance patterns among pediatric patient  isolates: report from the 2004 SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program on 3 continents.
AB  - Selecting empiric or directed therapy for pathogens isolated from pediatric patients can be problematic. Many antimicrobial agents are not indicated for use in pediatric patients, and regional variations of resistance mechanisms have been reported. The purpose of this study was to analyze antimicrobial resistance patterns and pathogen occurrence rates in pediatric-aged patient infections on 3 continents using data from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program. A total of 3537 clinical isolates were collected from 47 medical centers in 2004. With a protocol that dictated a sampling of 80 consecutive isolates from children (< or =18 years of age), all samples were forwarded to a central laboratory for reference susceptibility testing. Broth microdilution methods and current Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoint criteria were used. The 15 most frequently observed pathogens accounted for 93.6% of all isolates. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen isolated in North America (27.4%) and Europe (19.0%), but Escherichia coli was most common in Latin America (19.3%). All Streptococcus pneumoniae strains from North America and Latin America were susceptible to the newer fluoroquinolones, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin. However, 2 S. pneumoniae strains from Italy were resistant to gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin (> or =4 microg/mL). Ribotype and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns found that these resistant pneumococci were clonal. Numerous strains of Klebsiella spp. (22.5%), E. coli (4.5%), and Proteus mirabilis (4.9%) exhibited phenotypic extended-spectrum beta-lactamase resistance patterns. Four Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (3 from Latin America and 1 from Europe) were multidrug resistant, 2 P. aeruginosa isolates from Turkey were resistant to polymyxin B (> or =4 microg/mL), and 8.7% of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates from Latin America were resistant to the "drug of choice", trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Physicians should be aware of pathogen occurrences that vary by children's age, geographic location, and prior antimicrobial exposure. Therefore, continued surveillance will be necessary to monitor emerging antimicrobial resistance in the pediatric patient population, especially because new agents such as the fluoroquinolones are used to a greater extent in this age group.
TI  - Comparisons of parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporins tested against bacterial  isolates from pediatric patients: report from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (1998-2004).
AB  - A contemporary collection of 12737 strains from pediatric patients (<18 years) isolated over a 7-year period (1998-2004) from 52 sentinel hospitals in North America was tested to determine the comparative antimicrobial potency of broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporins and selected comparator agents. Most of the strains (84.1%) were isolated from blood stream or respiratory tract infections. The rank order of the top 10 pediatric pathogens analyzed was Streptococcus pneumoniae (15.5%) >Haemophilus influenzae (14.6%) >Staphylococcus aureus (13.8%) >Moraxella catarrhalis = coagulase-negative staphylococci (8.0%) >Escherichia coli (7.8%) >Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.2%) >Klebsiella spp. (4.8%) >Enterococcus spp. (4.7%) > beta-hemolytic streptococci (4.4%). Both cefepime and ceftriaxone (MIC(90), 1 microg/mL; 93.9% and 93.7% susceptible, respectively) were highly active against S. pneumoniae. However, the S. pneumoniae strains showed reduced susceptibility to ceftazidime (56.6%), as well as penicillin (56.6%) < trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (57.1%) < erythromycin (66.2%) < tetracycline (71.4%). beta-Hemolytic streptococci showed 100.0% susceptibility to penicillin, cefepime, and ceftriaxone. Cefepime and ceftriaxone exhibited high activity against oxacillin (methicillin)-susceptible S. aureus, (MIC(90), 4 microg/mL; 100.0% and 99.8% susceptible, respectively), whereas ceftazidime (MIC(90), 16 microg/mL) was active against only 86.7% of strains. H. influenzae strains showed complete susceptibility to cefepime, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin (MIC(90), < or =0.5 microg/mL; 100.0%), and 34.0% of H. influenzae and 99.2% of M. catarrhalis strains produced beta-lactamase. Although the 3 cephalosporins tested (cefepime, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime) were very active (98.6-99.6% susceptible) against E. coli, cefepime (99.0% susceptible) was slightly more active than ceftriaxone and ceftazidime (96.4% and 95.1% susceptible, respectively) against Klebsiella spp. Cefepime was also the most active beta-lactam agent tested against Enterobacter spp. (MIC(90), 2 microg/mL; 99.3% susceptible), whereas the susceptibility rates of other broad-spectrum beta-lactams (ceftriaxone, ceftazidime and piperacillin-tazobactam) were significantly lower (78.4-81.5%). Against P. aeruginosa, imipenem and piperacillin-tazobactam showed the highest susceptibility rates (94.4% and 93.3%, respectively), whereas imipenem and cefepime showed the lowest resistance rates (1.4% and 2.3%, respectively). Our results indicate that cefepime was the most broad-spectrum cephalosporin analyzed and remains a very potent alternative for the treatment of contemporary pediatric infections in North America.

TI  - How long do nosocomial pathogens persist on inanimate surfaces? A systematic review.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inanimate surfaces have often been described as the source for outbreaks of nosocomial infections. The aim of this review is to summarize data on the persistence of different nosocomial pathogens on inanimate surfaces. METHODS: The literature was systematically reviewed in MedLine without language restrictions. In addition, cited articles in a report were assessed and standard textbooks on the topic were reviewed. All reports with experimental evidence on the duration of persistence of a nosocomial pathogen on any type of surface were included. RESULTS: Most gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus spp. (including VRE), Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), or Streptococcus pyogenes, survive for months on dry surfaces. Many gram-negative species, such as Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, or Shigella spp., can also survive for months. A few others, such as Bordetella pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus vulgaris, or Vibrio cholerae, however, persist only for days. Mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and spore-forming bacteria, including Clostridium difficile, can also survive for months on surfaces. Candida albicans as the most important nosocomial fungal pathogen can survive up to 4 months on surfaces. Persistence of other yeasts, such as Torulopsis glabrata, was described to be similar (5 months) or shorter (Candida parapsilosis, 14 days). Most viruses from the respiratory tract, such as corona, coxsackie, influenza, SARS or rhino virus, can persist on surfaces for a few days. Viruses from the gastrointestinal tract, such as astrovirus, HAV, polio- or rota virus, persist for approximately 2 months. Blood-borne viruses, such as HBV or HIV, can persist for more than one week. Herpes viruses, such as CMV or HSV type 1 and 2, have been shown to persist from only a few hours up to 7 days. CONCLUSION: The most common nosocomial pathogens may well survive or persist on surfaces for months and can thereby be a continuous source of transmission if no regular preventive surface disinfection is performed.
TI  - The housekeeping dipeptide permease is the Escherichia coli heme transporter and  functions with two optional peptide binding proteins.
AB  - Heme, a major iron source, is transported through the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria by specific heme/hemoprotein receptors and through the inner membrane by heme-specific, periplasmic, binding protein-dependent, ATP-binding cassette permeases. Escherichia coli K12 does not use exogenous heme, and no heme uptake genes have been identified. Nevertheless, a recombinant E. coli strain expressing just one foreign heme outer membrane receptor can use exogenous heme as an iron source. This result suggests either that heme might be able to cross the cytoplasmic membrane in the absence of specific carrier or that there is a functional inner membrane heme transporter. Here, we show that to use heme iron E. coli requires the dipeptide inner membrane ATP-binding cassette transporter (DppBCDF) and either of two periplasmic binding proteins: MppA, the L-alanyl-gamma-D-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelate binding protein, or DppA, the dipeptide binding protein. Thus, wild-type E. coli has a peptide/heme permease despite being unable to use exogenous heme. DppA, which shares sequence similarity with the Haemophilus influenzae heme-binding protein HbpA, and MppA are functional heme-binding proteins. Peptides compete with heme for binding both "in vitro" and "in vivo."
TI  - Pore characteristics of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae outer membrane protein P5 in planar lipid bilayers.
AB  - The structure of outer membrane protein P5 of NTHi, a homolog of Escherichia coli OmpA, was investigated by observing its pore characteristics in planar lipid bilayers. Recombinant NTHi P5 was overexpressed in E. coli and purified using ionic detergent, LDS-P5, or nonionic detergent, OG-P5. LDS-P5 and OG-P5 could not be distinguished by their migration on SDS-PAGE gels; however, when incorporated into planar bilayers of DPhPC between symmetric aqueous solutions of 1 M KCl at 22 degrees C, LDS-P5 formed narrow pores (58 +/- 6 pS) with low open probability, whereas OG-P5 formed large pores (1.1 +/- 0.1 nS) with high open probability (0.99). LDS-P5 narrow pores were gradually and irreversibly transformed into large pores, indistinguishable from those formed by OG-P5, at temperatures >or=40 degrees C; the process took 4-6 h at 40 degrees C or 35-45 min at 42 degrees C. Large pores were stable to changes in temperatures; however, large pores were rapidly converted to narrow pores when exposed to LDS at room temperatures, indicating acute sensitivity of this conformer to ionic detergent. These studies suggest that narrow pores are partially denatured forms and support the premise that the native conformation of NTHi P5 is that of a large monomeric pore.
TI  - Retention of core catalytic functions by a conserved minimal ribonuclease E peptide that lacks the domain required for tetramer formation.
AB  - Ribonuclease E (RNase E) is a multifunctional endoribonuclease that has been evolutionarily conserved in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. X-ray crystallography and biochemical studies have concluded that the Escherichia coli RNase E protein functions as a homotetramer formed by Zn linkage of dimers within a region extending from amino acid residues 416 through 529 of the 116-kDa protein. Using fragments of RNase E proteins from E. coli and Haemophilus influenzae, we show here that RNase E derivatives that are as short as 395 amino acid residues and that lack the Zn-link region shown previously to be essential for tetramer formation (i.e. amino acid residues 400-415) are catalytically active enzymes that retain the 5' to 3' scanning ability and cleavage site specificity characteristic of full-length RNase E and that also confer colony forming ability on rne null mutant bacteria. Further truncation leads to loss of these properties. Our results, which identify a minimal catalytically active RNase E sequence, indicate that contrary to current models, a tetrameric quaternary structure is not required for RNase E to carry out its core enzymatic functions.
TI  - Environmental signals implicated in Dr fimbriae release by pathogenic Escherichia coli.
AB  - Afa/Dr diffusely adhering Escherichia coli have been shown to cause urinary tract infections and enteric infections. Virulence of Dr-positive IH11128 bacteria is associated with the presence of Dr fimbriae. In this report, we show for the first time that the Dr fimbriae are released in the extracellular medium in response to multiple environmental signals. Production and secretion of Dr fimbriae are clearly thermoregulated. A comparison of the amounts of secreted fimbriae showed that the secretion is drastically increased during anaerobic growth in minimal medium. The effect of anaerobiosis on secretion seemed to depend on both the growth phase and the culture medium. The secretion was maximal during the logarithmic-phase growth and corresponded to 27 and 57% of total Dr fimbriae produced by bacteria grown in mineral medium+glucose and LB broth, respectively. Thus, the anaerobic environment of the colon would favour the secretion of Dr fimbriae during bacterial multiplication. The controlled release of the Dr fimbriae, which is carried out in the absence of cellular lysis, appears independent of the action of proteases or a process of maturation. The mechanism employed in the liberation of Dr fimbriae thus seems different from that described for the adhesins FHA and Hap of Bordetella pertussis and Haemophilus influenzae.
TI  - Bacteremia in children at a regional hospital in Trinidad.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to provide a Trinidadian perspective on pediatric community-acquired and hospital-acquired bacteremia via the documentation of common etiologic agents, antimicrobial profiles of the isolated pathogens, and patient outcome. METHODS: This was a six-year retrospective study of children with bacteremia admitted to the pediatric wards of the San Fernando General Hospital, Trinidad. RESULTS: Seven hundred and four episodes of pediatric bacteremia were reviewed during the six-year study period. The predominant isolate was Staphylococcus aureus (23.9%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.5%), and Enterobacter spp (11.1%). The remaining isolates each accounted for less than 10% of total isolates. The mortality rate was highest for P. aeruginosa (39.4%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (22.5%), and Escherichia coli (19.2%). Of the six cases due to Neisseria meningitidis, only two survived. The overall mortality rate for the study period was 15.1%, but varied considerably according to age. All deaths due to P. aeruginosa and E. coli occurred in neonates. Almost 90% and about half of all S. aureus were resistant to ampicillin and erythromycin, respectively; nineteen (11.3%) were methicillin-resistant. More than 95% of K. pneumoniae and more than 87% of Haemophilus influenzae were resistant to ampicillin. Group B streptococci were fully susceptible to ampicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, but showed >90% and >70% resistance to tetracycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, respectively. Of the 40 strains of S. pneumoniae isolated, 10.0% had a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) >or=4 microg/mL (resistance) and 12.5% had a MIC=2.0 microg/mL (intermediate resistance) to ceftriaxone, while 7.5% showed intermediate resistance (MIC between 0.12 and 1 microg/mL) and 25.0% showed resistance (MIC >or=2 microg/mL) to penicillin. CONCLUSION: The bacteremia rate was found to be 8.4% among hospitalized children suspected of having sepsis and from whom a blood culture was positive. Bacteremia was also associated with a high mortality rate of 15.1%. An unusually high level of bacteremia with Gram-negative enteric bacteria was seen, which might indicate cross infection and reflect a breakdown in infection control measures. Relatively high-level resistance of S. pneumoniae to penicillin and ceftriaxone was not seen, even though the overall prevalence of resistance to other antibiotics among other pathogens was relatively low. The drugs that showed the greatest efficacy were imipenem, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and the cephalosporins ceftazidime and ceftriaxone.
TI  - Haemophilus influenzae surface fibrils contribute to serum resistance by interacting with vitronectin.
AB  - Vitronectin inhibits the membrane attack complex of the complement system and is  found both in plasma and the extracellular matrix. In this study, we have identified the outer membrane protein Haemophilus surface fibrils (Hsf) as the major vitronectin-binding protein in encapsulated H. influenzae type b. A H. influenzae mutant devoid of Hsf showed a significantly decreased binding to both soluble and immobilized vitronectin as compared with the wild-type counterpart. Moreover, Escherichia coli-expressing Hsf at the surface strongly adhered to immobilized vitronectin. Importantly, the H. influenzae Hsf mutant had a markedly reduced survival as compared with the wild-type bacterium when incubated with normal human serum. A series of truncated Hsf fragments were recombinantly manufactured in E. coli. The vitronectin binding regions were located within two separate binding domains. In conclusion, Hsf interacts with vitronectin and thereby inhibits the complement-mediated bactericidal activity, and thus is a major H. influenzae virulence factor.
TI  - Detection of operons.
AB  - Operons are clusters of genes that are transcribed as a single message, and regulated by the same gene expression machinery. They are found primarily in prokaryotic genomes. Because genes in the same operon are likely to have related functions, identification of the operon structure is potentially useful for assigning gene function. We report the development and benchmarking of two different methods for detecting operons, based on an analysis of 42 fully sequenced prokaryotic organisms. The Gene Neighbor method (GNM) utilizes the relatively high conservation of gene order in operons, compared with genes in general. The Gene Gap Method (GGM) makes use of the relatively short gap between genes in operons compared with that otherwise found between adjacent genes. The methods have been benchmarked using KEGG pathway data and RegulonDB Escherichia coli operon data. With optimum parameters, the specificity of the GNM is 93% and the sensitivity is 70%. For the GGM, the specificity is 95% and the sensitivity is 68%. Together, the two methods have a sensitivity of 87.2%, while joint predictions have a sensitivity of 50% and a specificity of 98%. The methods are used to infer possible functions for some hypothetical genes in prokaryotic genomes. The methods have proven a useful addition to structure information in deriving protein function in a structural genomics project.
TI  - The channel-tunnel HI1462 of Haemophilus influenzae reveals differences to Escherichia coli TolC.
AB  - Efflux pumps play a major role in multidrug resistance of pathogenic bacteria. The TolC homologue HI1462 was identified as the single channel-tunnel in Haemophilus influenzae required to form a functional multidrug efflux pump. The outer-membrane protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and reconstituted in black lipid membranes. It exhibited a comparatively small single-channel conductance of 43 pS in 1 M KCl and is the first known TolC homologue which is anion-selective. The HI1462 structure was modelled and an arginine residue lining the tunnel entrance was identified. The channel-tunnel of a mutant with the arginine substituted by an alanine residue was cation-selective and had a sevenfold higher single-channel conductance compared to wild-type. These results confirm that the arginine is responsible for anion selectivity and forms a salt bridge with a glutamate residue of the adjacent monomer, establishing a circular network, which keeps the tunnel entrance in a tightly closed conformation. In in vivo experiments, both the wild-type HI1462 and the mutant were able to substitute for E. coli TolC in the haemolysin secretion system, but not in the AcrAB/TolC multidrug efflux pump. The structure-function relationship of HI1462 is discussed in the context of the well-studied TolC channel-tunnel of E. coli.
TI  - Purification and characterization of Thermotoga maritima homoserine transsuccinylase indicates it is a transacetylase.
AB  - The methionine biosynthetic pathway found in bacteria is controlled at the first  step, acylation of the gamma-hydroxyl of homoserine. This reaction is catalyzed by one of two unique enzymes, homoserine transacetylase or homoserine transsuccinylase, which have no amino acid sequence similarity. We cloned, expressed, and purified homoserine transsuccinylase from the thermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima. Substrate specificity experiments demonstrated that acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) is the preferred acyl donor and is used at least 30-fold more efficiently than succinyl-CoA. Steady-state kinetic experiments confirm that the enzyme utilizes a ping-pong kinetic mechanism in which the acetate group of acetyl-CoA is initially transferred to an enzyme nucleophile before subsequent transfer to homoserine. The maximal velocity, V/K (acetyl-CoA) and V/K (homoserine), all exhibited bell-shaped pH curves with apparent pKs of 6.0-6.9 and 8.2-8.8. The enzyme was inactivated by iodoacetamide in a pH-dependent manner, with an apparent pK of 6.3, suggesting the presence of an active-site cysteine residue which forms an acetyl-enzyme thioester intermediate during catalytic turnover, similar to observations with other transsuccinylases. In addition, the enzyme is highly stable at elevated temperatures, maintaining full activity at 70 degrees C. Taken together, these data suggest that the T. maritima enzyme functions biochemically as a transacetylase, despite having the sequence of a transsuccinylase.
TI  - Escherichia coli competence gene homologs are essential for competitive fitness and the use of DNA as a nutrient.
AB  - Natural genetic competence is the ability of cells to take up extracellular DNA and is an important mechanism for horizontal gene transfer. Another potential benefit of natural competence is that exogenous DNA can serve as a nutrient source for starving bacteria because the ability to "eat" DNA is necessary for competitive survival in environments containing limited nutrients. We show here that eight Escherichia coli genes, identified as homologs of com genes in Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, are necessary for the use of extracellular DNA as the sole source of carbon and energy. These genes also confer a competitive advantage to E. coli during long-term stationary-phase incubation. We also show that homologs of these genes are found throughout the proteobacteria, suggesting that the use of DNA as a nutrient may be a widespread phenomenon.
TI  - Antibiotic consumption and generation of resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae:  the paradoxical impact of quinolones in a complex selective landscape.
AB  - The development of resistance to the different antibiotics by the majority of bacterial species of clinical importance seems unavoidable. However, not all drugs have the same efficiency to select for resistance. Large differences in the qualitative and quantitative consumption of antibiotics among countries are known to exist and several authors have consistently reported the direct relationship between consumption and selection of resistance for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli and beta-lactams and macrolides use. In Spain, extensive surveillance started in 1996, and the Willow (SAUCE) Project, to monitor and update resistance in respiratory pathogens and to couple those data with data concerning national antibiotic consumption (IMS) from both a temporal and geographical approach. Temporally, despite a continuous increase of 16% in quinolone consumption from 1997 to 2001, basically due to the arrival of respiratory quinolones, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, a continuous linear increase in the resistance rates to ciprofloxacin in S. pneumoniae was not observed. There also was an inverse correlation between provincial consumption of quinolones and resistance to ciprofloxacin. Several hypotheses are proposed and discussed to explain these apparent paradoxical observations, such as the replacement of ciprofloxacin by more potent antipneumococcal quinolones, the possibility of an antibiotic pressure threshold, the influence of other nonquinolone drugs on the expression of ciprofloxacin-resistance biological costs, and the influence of changes in temporal or spatial prevalence of particular clones.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of BacT/ALERT 3D and BACTEC systems for the recovery of pathogens causing bloodstream infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare BacT/ALERT (BTA) and BACTEC 9240 (BAC), two continuously monitoring automated blood culture systems, for the recovery of bloodstream pathogens and standard media available for these systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples from 100 adults and 50 paediatric patients suspected of having bloodstream infections were inoculated at the bedside into non-vented BTA and BAC standard blood culture bottles and incubated in their respective instruments. The time to growth detection (TD) was recorded for each bottle that became positive. A quantitative assay was also carried out with 5 standard bloodstream pathogens to assess TD of each pathogen as well as the quantity of organisms recovered. RESULTS: A total of 23 isolates representing true infections were recovered by both BTA and BAC bottles, indicating a blood culture positivity rate of 15.3%, 18 (78.3%) by BTA bottles and 13 (56.5%) by BAC. Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Clostridium perfringens were recovered only by the BTA system. The average TDs were 19.0 and 24.6 h for BTA and BAC, respectively. Analysis of the quantitative growth of known pathogens in both systems was more or less the same for Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa but slightly different for Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The anaerobic bottle ofthe BTA did not support the growth of H. influenzae below an inoculum of 10(10) CFU/ml whereas the BAC did so at a lower inoculum of 10(8) CFU/ml. TD for S. pneumoniae in the BTA was about half of that in the BAC. CONCLUSIONS: The BTA system appears to be more efficient in detecting common bloodstream pathogens asa higher inoculum is needed for the BAC system to detect the same organism.
TI  - [A multicentre study on the pathogenic agents in 665 adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia in cities of China].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pathogenic causes of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adult patients in China, the relation of previous antibiotic use and the Pneumonia Patient Outcome Research Team (PORT) classification to microbial etiology, and the prevalence of drug resistance of common CAP bacteria. METHODS: A prospective study was performed on 665 consecutive adult patients with CAP at 12 centers in 7 Chinese cities during one year. The etiology of pneumonia was considered if one of the following criteria was met: (1) valid sputum sample yielding one or more predominant strains; (2) blood cultures yielding a bacterial pathogen; (3) seroconversion, a > or = 4-fold increase or decrease titers of antibodies to Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of respiratory tract isolates was determined using the agar dilution method. RESULTS: Pathogens were identified in 324/610 patients (53.1%) with valid serum samples and sputum cultures as follows: Mycoplasma pneumoniae (126, 20.7%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (63, 10.3%), Haemophilus influenzae (56, 9.2%), Chlamydia pneumoniae (40, 6.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (37, 6.1%), Legionella pneumophila (31, 5.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (23, 3.8%), Escherichia coli (10, 1.6%), Moraxella catarrhalis (8, 1.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6, 1.0%). Of 195 patients with a bacterial pathogen, an atypical pathogen was identified in 62 (10.2%) cases. The non-susceptibility rate of Streptococcus pneumoniae to penicillin, azithromycin, and moxifloxacin was 20.3%, 75.4% and 4.3% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Atypical pathogens have important role in CAP, with Mycoplasma pneumoniae being the most common pathogen, and mixed infection of atypical pathogens with bacteria was found in 10.2% of the cases. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae remain the most important bacteria for CAP. More than 75.0% of Streptococcus pneumoniae was resistant to macrolides and 20.3% was resistant to penicillin.
TI  - Identification of a novel noncatalytic bicarbonate binding site in eubacterial beta-carbonic anhydrase.
AB  - The structures of beta class carbonic anhydrases (beta-CAs) determined so far fall into two distinct subclasses based on the observed coordination of the catalytic zinc (Zn2+) ion. The subclass of beta-CAs that coordinate Zn2+ tetrahedrally with four protein-derived ligands is represented by the structures of orthologues from Porphyridium purpureum, Escherichia coli, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Here we present the structure of an additional member of that subclass, that from Haemophilus influenzae, as well as detailed kinetic analysis, revealing the correspondence between structural classification and kinetic profile for this subclass. In addition, we identify a unique, noncatalytic binding mode for the substrate bicarbonate that occurs in both the H. influenzae and E. coli enzymes. The kinetic and structural analysis indicates that binding of bicarbonate in this site of the enzyme may modulate its activity by influencing a pH-dependent, cooperative transition between active and inactive forms. We hypothesize that the two structural subclasses of beta-CAs may provide models for the proposed active and inactive forms of the H. influenzae and E. coli enzymes.
TI  - Changing epidemiology of outpatient bacteremia in 3- to 36-month-old children after the introduction of the heptavalent-conjugated pneumococcal vaccine.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The introduction of routine vaccination with heptavalent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine has changed the overall incidence of bacteremia in children 3 months-3 years old. OBJECTIVE: To describe the changing incidence and etiology of bacteremia in previously healthy toddlers presenting to outpatient clinical settings. METHODS: Retrospective case series of all blood cultures obtained between September 1998 and August 2003 in Kaiser Permanente Northern California outpatient clinics and emergency departments from previously healthy children 3 months-3 years old. RESULTS: Implementation of routine vaccination with the conjugated pneumococcal vaccine resulted in an 84% reduction of Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia (1.3-0.2%) and a 67% reduction in overall bacteremia (1.6-0.7%) in the study population. The rate of blood culture isolation of contaminating organisms remained unchanged at 1.8%; therefore, by the end of the study, >70% of organisms identified in blood cultures were contaminants. During the 5 study years, total blood cultures drawn decreased by 35% in outpatient pediatric clinics but remained unchanged in emergency departments. By 2003, one-third of all pathogenic organisms isolated from blood cultures were Escherichia coli, one-third were non-vaccine serotype S. pneumoniae, the majority of the remaining one-third were Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp., Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pyogenes. In our population of children routinely immunized with the conjugated pneumococcal vaccine, a white blood cell count >15,000 by itself is a poor predictor of bacteremia in the febrile toddler (sensitivity, 74.0%; specificity, 54.5%; positive predictive value, 1.5%; negative predictive value, 99.5%). CONCLUSION: In the United States, routine vaccinations with Haemophilus influenzae type b and S. pneumoniae vaccines have made bacteremia in the previously healthy toddler a rare event. As the incidence of pneumococcal bacteremia has decreased, E. coli, Salmonella spp. and Staphylococcus aureus have increased in relative importance. The use of the white blood cell count alone to guide the empiric use of antibiotics is not indicated. New guidelines are needed to approach the previously healthy febrile toddler in the outpatient setting.
TI  - Dissection of a functional interaction between the DNA translocase, FtsK, and the XerD recombinase.
AB  - Successful bacterial circular chromosome segregation requires that any dimeric chromosomes, which arise by crossing over during homologous recombination, are converted to monomers. Resolution of dimers to monomers requires the action of the XerCD site-specific recombinase at dif in the chromosome replication terminus region. This reaction requires the DNA translocase, FtsK(C), which activates dimer resolution by catalysing an ATP hydrolysis-dependent switch in the catalytic state of the nucleoprotein recombination complex. We show that a 62-amino-acid fragment of FtsK(C) interacts directly with the XerD C-terminus in order to stimulate the cleavage by XerD of BSN, a dif-DNA suicide substrate containing a nick in the 'bottom' strand. The resulting recombinase-DNA covalent complex can undergo strand exchange with intact duplex dif in the absence of ATP. FtsK(C)-mediated stimulation of BSN cleavage by XerD requires synaptic complex formation. Mutational impairment of the XerD-FtsK(C) interaction leads to reduction in the in vitro stimulation of BSN cleavage by XerD and a concomitant deficiency in the resolution of chromosomal dimers at dif in vivo, although other XerD functions are not affected.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and characterization of a novel phosphatase gene, phoI, from  soil bacterium Enterobacter sp. 4.
AB  - A gene, phoI, coding for a phosphatase from Enterobacter sp. 4 was cloned in Escherichia coli and sequenced. Analysis of the sequence revealed one open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a 269-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 29 kDa. PhoI belongs to family B acid phosphatase and exhibits 49.4% identity and 62.4% homology to the hel gene from Heamophilus influenzae, which encoded an outer membrane protein (P4). The optimum pH and temperature for phosphatase activity were pH 5.5 and 40 degrees C, respectively. Its specific activity on rho-nitrophenyl phosphatate was 70 U/mg at pH 5.5 and 40 degrees C. Enzyme activity was inhibited by Al3+, EDTA, and DTT, but fivefold activated by Cu2+ ion (350 U/mg). PhoI showed a strong synergistic effect when used with a purified E. coli phytase, AppA, to estimate combination effects.
TI  - Bacteraemia in homozygous sickle cell disease in Africa: is pneumococcal prophylaxis justified?
AB  - BACKGROUND: The high frequency of Streptococcus pneumoniae as a cause of bacteraemia in homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease and its effective prevention has led to the routine use of pneumococcal prophylaxis in developed countries. The reported infrequency of this organism as a cause of bacteraemia in SS disease in Africa raises questions on the epidemiology of bacterial infection and on the need for pneumococcal prophylaxis in that continent. METHODS: A study of blood cultures in 155 Ugandan children (165 episodes) with SS disease and axillary temperatures of > or =38 degrees C, attending the University Teaching Hospital in Kampala (Uganda, East Africa). RESULTS: Positive blood cultures, obtained in 47/165 episodes, showed Staphylococcus aureus in 28 (60%) samples, Haemophilus influenzae in 9 (19%), Staphylococcus epidermidis in 4 (9%), and single cases of Streptococcus viridans, Escherichia coli and an unidentified Gram negative rod. Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified in only 3 (6%) episode. CONCLUSION: The infrequent isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae from febrile children with SS disease in this study and in four other studies from Nigeria raises questions on a different spectrum of bacterial causes for bacteraemia in malarial areas. There are several possible explanations for this finding, but the data cast sufficient doubt on the case for pneumococcal prophylaxis for a controlled trial on its effectiveness in that environment to seem justified. These data are necessary to determine its role in African children and to provide the evidence base for healthcare authorities in equatorial Africa.
TI  - [Nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2004].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of meropenem (MEPM) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 907 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, 1790 strains of Gram-negative bacteria, and 192 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2004 was measured. The results were as follows; 1. MIC90 of MEPM for almost all of enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae were 4-fold to 32-fold lower than those of other carbapenems. MEPM was more active than other carbapenem antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and H. influenzae. MEPM were active against most of the species tested in Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. 2. As for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, imipenem (IPM) showed high cross-resistant rate againt meropenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (87.9%). MEPM showed low cross-resistant rate both againt IPM-resistant P. aeruginosa (49.2%) and ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa (38.0%). 3. The proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) strains was 3.1% (4 strains) in Escherichia coli, 8.0% (2 strains) in Citrobacter koseri, 2.5% (3 strains) in Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2.5% (2 strains) in Enterobacter cloacae, 0.9% (1 strains) in Serratia marcescens, and 2.2% (2 strains) in Proteus mirabilis. The proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 1.6% (5 strains) in P. aeruginosa. 4. Of all species tested, Peptostreptococcus spp. was the only species, which MIC90 of MEPM was more than 4-fold higher than that in our previous study using clinical isolates during 2002 (0.25 microg/ml --> 1 microg/ml). Therefore, there is almost no siginificant decrease in susceptibility of clinical isolates to meropenem. In conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that MEPM retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem at present, 9 years after available for commercial use.
TI  - [Trends in pediatric bacterial meningitis in Japan (2003-2004)].
AB  - We surveyed the epidemiology of pediatric bacterial meningitis between January 2003 and December 2004 in Japan, with the following results: Bacterial meningitis cases numbered 233 (132 boys, 98 girls, and 3 unidentified), equivalent to 1.13-1.6 children of 1000 hospitalized in pediatrics per year. The age distribution for the infections was the highest under 1 year of age, decreasing with increasing age. Haemophilus influenzae was the most common pathogen, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae, group B streptococcus, and Escherichia coli. The relationship between causactive pathogens and age distribution was as follows: group B. streptococcus and E. coli were major pathogens below 4 months of age and H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae were major pathogens above 4 months of age. Susceptibility tests at each facility demonstrated that 65.0% of H. influenzae isolates and 83.0% of S. pneumoniae isolates in 2004 were drug-resistant. Ampicillin and cephem antibiotics are currently effective against GBS, E. coli and Listeria so a combination of ampicillin and cephem antibiotics is used first line at many facilities for patients below 4 months of age. A combination of carbapenem which showed effective against PRSP and cephem which showed effective against H. influenzae is the first choice in childhood bacterial meningitis for patients above 4 months of age.
TI  - Elucidation of sulfadoxine resistance with structural models of the bifunctional  Plasmodium falciparum dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase-dihydropteroate synthase.
AB  - Resistance of the most virulent human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, to antifolates is spreading with increasing speed, especially in Africa. Antifolate resistance is mainly caused by point mutations in the P. falciparum dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) target proteins. Homology models of the bifunctional P. falciparum dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase-dihydropteroate synthase (PPPK-DHPS) enzyme as well as the separate domains complete with bound substrates were constructed using the crystal structures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (PPPK-DHPS), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (DHPS), Bacillus anthracis (DHPS), and Escherichia coli (PPPK) as templates. The resulting structures were subsequently solvated and refined using molecular dynamics. The active site residues of DHPS are highly conserved in S. cerevisiae, M. tuberculosis, E. coli, S. aureus, and B. anthracis, an attribute also shared by P. falciparum DHPS. Sulfadoxine was superimposed into the equivalent position of the p-aminobenzoic acid substrate and its binding parameters were refined using minimization and molecular dynamics. Sulfadoxine appears to interact mainly with P. falciparum DHPS mainly through hydrophobic interactions. Rational explanations are provided by the model for the sulfadoxine resistance-causing effects of four of the five known mutations in P. falciparum DHPS. A possible structure for the bifunctional PPPK-DHPS was derived from the structure from the S. cerevisiae bifunctional enzyme. The active site residues of P. falciparum PPPK are also conserved when compared to S. cerevisiae, Haemophilus influenzae, and E. coli. The informative nature of these models opens up avenues for structure-based drug design approaches toward the development of alternative and more effective inhibitors of P. falciparum PPPK-DHPS.
TI  - Structure of the pseudouridine synthase RsuA from Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The structure of the pseudouridine synthase RsuA from Haemophilus influenza, which catalyzes the conversion of uridine to pseudouridine at a single position within 16S ribosomal RNA, has been determined at 1.59 A resolution and compared with that of Escherichia coli RsuA. The H. influenza enzyme contains an N-terminal S4-like alpha3beta4 domain followed by a catalytic domain, as observed in the structure of E. coli RsuA. Whereas the individual domains of E. coli and H. influenza RsuA are structurally similar, their relative spatial disposition differs greatly between the two structures. The former displays an extended open conformation with no direct contacts between the domains, while the latter is in a closed conformation with a large interface between the two domains. Domain closure presents several basic and polar residues into a putative RNA-binding cleft. It is proposed that this relative repositioning of the S4 and catalytic domains is used to modulate the shape and size of the rRNA-binding site in RsuA and in other pseudouridine synthases possessing S4 domains.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of novel 2-thiazolylimino-5-arylidene-4-thiazolidinones.
AB  - New 2-thiazolylimino-5-arylidene-4-thiazolidinones (compounds 4a-j), unsubstituted or carrying hydroxy, methoxy, nitro and chloro groups on the benzene ring, were synthesized and assayed in vitro for their antimicrobial activity against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, yeasts and mould. The compounds were very potent towards all tested Gram positive microorganisms (MIC ranging from 0.03 to 6 microg/mL in most of the cases) and Gram negative Haemophilus influenzae (MIC 0.15-1.5 microg/mL), whereas no effectiveness was exhibited against Gram negative Escherichia coli and fungi up to the concentration of 100 microg/mL. The 5-arylidene derivatives showed an antibacterial efficacy considerably greater than that of the parent 2-(thiazol-2-ylimino)thiazolidin-4-one 3, suggesting that the substituted and unsubstituted 5-arylidene moiety plays an important role in enhancing the antimicrobial properties of this class of compounds. The remarkable inhibition of the growth of penicillin-resistant staphylococci makes these substances promising agents also for the treatment of infections caused by microorganisms resistant to currently available drugs.
TI  - Peptidoglycan recognition by Pal, an outer membrane lipoprotein.
AB  - Peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (Pal) is a potential vaccine candidate from  Haemophilus influenzae that is highly conserved in Gram-negative bacteria and anchored to the outer membrane through an N-terminal lipid attachment. Pal stabilizes the outer membrane by providing a noncovalent link to the peptidoglycan (PG) layer through a periplasmic domain. Using NMR spectroscopy, we determined the three-dimensional structure of a complex between the periplasmic domain of Pal and a biosynthetic peptidoglycan precursor (PG-P), UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-L-Ala-alpha-d-Glu-m-Dap-D-Ala-d-Ala (m-Dap is meso-diaminopimelate). Pal has a binding pocket lined with conserved surface residues that interacts exclusively with the peptide portion of the ligand. The m-Dap residue, which is mainly found in the cell walls of Gram-negative bacteria, is sequestered in this pocket and plays an important role by forming hydrogen bond and hydrophobic contacts to Pal. The structure provides insight into the mode of cell wall recognition for a broad class of Gram-negative membrane proteins, including OmpA and MotB, which have peptidoglycan-binding domains homologous to that of Pal.
TI  - Commensals upon us.
AB  - A battle to control and curtail bacterial infectious diseases is being waged in our hospitals and communities through antibiotic therapies and vaccines targeting specific species. But what effects do these interventions have on the epidemiology of infections caused by the organisms that are part of our natural microbial flora? Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria appear as new disease agents from among commensal flora. These include vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE), community-associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA), non-vaccine invasive serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae, new strains of non-type b Haemophilus influenzae and multi-drug resistant Escherichia coli. These examples illustrate how clinical improvements and widespread use and misuse of antibiotics have pushed evolution, allowing normally non-pathogenic strains to become infectious disease threats to human health.
TI  - Hin4II, a new prototype restriction endonuclease from Haemophilus influenzae RFL4: discovery, cloning and expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The genes encoding restriction-modification system of unknown specificity Hin4II  from Haemophilus influenzae RFL4 were cloned in Escherichia coli and sequenced. The Hin4II system comprises three tandemly arranged genes coding for m6A DNA methyltransferase, m5C DNA methyltransferase and restriction endonuclease, respectively. Restriction endonuclease was expressed in E. coli and purified to apparent homogeneity. The DNA recognition sequence and cleavage positions were determined. R.Hin4II recognizes the novel non-palindromic sequence 5'-CCTTC-3' and cleaves the DNA 6 and 5 nt downstream in the top and bottom strand, respectively. The new prototype restriction endonuclease Hin4II was classified as a potential candidate of HNH nuclease family after comparison against SMART database. An amino acid sequence motif 297H-X14-N-X8-H of Hin4II was proposed as forming a putative catalytic center.
TI  - Bacterial profile and clinical outcome of childhood meningitis in rural Yemen: a  2-year hospital-based study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) is an important cause of death and long-term neurological disability in Yemen, the only low income-high mortality country in the Arabian Peninsula. The objective of this study was to document the microbial characteristics, the antibacterial sensitivity pattern, and the outcome for children hospitalized with ABM, prior to the introduction of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine in Yemen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was retrospective, conducted at a rural district hospital, serving the rural population of the northern parts of Yemen. All patients aged 1 month-15 years admitted between May 1999 and June 2001, with clinical evidence of meningitis and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultured, were included in the study. Clinical information from case notes, including CSF result and the outcome on discharge, were obtained. Analysis of extracted data was performed using Epi Info software. RESULTS: During the 2-year study period, 160 study patients met the inclusion criteria, and 7 (4.4%) were negative for bacterial growth. In the 153 positive cultures there were 46 (30.1%) Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP), 23 (15%) H. influenzae (HI), 81 (52.9) Neisseria meningitidis (NM), 2 (1.3%) Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and 1 (0.7%) Escherichia coli. Sixteen study patients died (overall case fatality rate (CFR) 10%), 7 aged under 12 months, 6 aged 12-60 months, and 3 more than 60 months. Ten deaths were due to SP meningitis, 2 HI meningitis, 3 NM meningitis, and 1 had S. aureus. Of the 144 survivors, 28 (19.4%) developed permanent neurological complications, 17 aged less than 12 months, 6 aged 12-60 months, and 5 more than 60 months. SP meningitis accounted for 57.1% (16/28), and 6 (21.4%) had HI meningitis. Among the 89 aged 1-60 months, 13 died (CFR 14.6%), and 23 (30.3%) of the 76 survivors developed permanent complications. Of those tested 20% and 35% of the 20 HI tested isolates and 9.5% and 14.3% of the 42 SP isolates, were resistant to ampicillin and penicillin G, respectively, and the majority of the 81 NM isolates were sensitive to both. The 3 pathogens were largely resistant to gentamicin, and almost all were susceptible to chloramphenicol and cefotaxime. CONCLUSION: In contrast to the studies from the low-mortality countries of the region, our study showed that the predominant pathogens of childhood ABM were SP and NM. SP meningitis was associated with increased mortality and permanent disability.
TI  - Effect of C-terminal 44 amino acids deletion on activity of Haemophilus influenzae UvrA protein.
AB  - UV-sensitive mutant strain of Haemophilus influenzae Rd MBH3, is 20 times more sensitive to UV irradiation than the wild type strain. The mutation responsible for increased UV sensitivity of the strain was identified as G --> A transition predicting synthesis of truncated UvrAdeltaC44 protein (Balsara & Joshi). Recombinant UvrAdeltaC44 protein was purified for the first time under denaturing conditions. The molecular weight of the recombinant protein was estimated as approximately100 kDa. Recombinant UvrAdeltaC44 protein was found to be less efficient in its ATPase and DNA binding activity as compared to the wild type protein. Recombinant plasmid carrying uvrAdeltaC44 gene could partially complement the UvrA deficiency in E. coli UvrA mutant.
TI  - Backbone 1H, 15N, and 13C resonance assignments and secondary-structure of conserved hypothetical protein HP0894 from Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - HP0894 (SwissProt/TrEMBL ID O25554) is an 88-residue conserved hypothetical protein from Helicobacter pylori strain 26695 with a calculated pI of 8.5 and a molecular weight of 10.38 kDa. Proteins with sequence similarity to HP0894 exist in Vibrio choierae, Enterococcus faecalis, Campylobacter jejuni, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli O157, etc. Here we report the sequence-specific backbone resonance assignments of HP0894. About 97.5% (418/429) of the HN, N, CO, Ca, Cbeta resonances of the 88 residues of HP0894 were assigned. On the basis of these assignments, three helical regions and four strand regions were identified using the CSI program. This study is a prerequisite for calculating the solution structure of HP0894, and studying its interaction with its substrates, if any, and/or with other proteins.
TI  - Bicistronic expression plasmid for the rapid production of recombinant fused proteins in Escherichia coli.
AB  - In the post-genomic era, every aspect of the production of proteins must be accelerated. In this way, several vectors are currently exploited for rapid production of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli. N-terminal fusions to the first 47 amino acids of the LpdA (dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase A) protein of Neisseria meningitidis have been shown to increase the expression of recombinant proteins. Consequently, we have constructed a modified N-terminal LpdA fusion vector, introducing the blue/white colony selection by exploiting a bicistronic gene organization. In the new vector, the sequence encoding the first 47 amino acids of meningococcal LpdA and the alpha-peptide sequence of beta-galactosidase were connected via a ribosome-binding site, and two MCSs (multiple cloning sites) were located surrounding the latter, allowing efficient cloning by colour selection of recombinants. The vector was also improved with the addition of a C-terminal polyhistidine tag, and an EKS (enterokinase recognition sequence) immediately after the LpdA fusion sequence. The new plasmid was employed in the expression and purification of six different bacterial polypeptides. One of these recombinant proteins, P6 protein from Haemophilus influenzae, was used as a model and its N-terminal fusion sequence was totally removed from the recombinant version after incubation with the enterokinase protease, while the polyhistidine tail successfully allowed the purification of the unfused protein from the protease reaction. Two completely new neisserial vaccine candidates, NMB0088 and NMB1126 proteins, were cloned, expressed and purified using this system. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first report of the cloning and expression of these proteins in E. coli.
TI  - Different modes of action of naphthyridones in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Naphthyridones that were recently described as a class of translation inhibitors  in gram-positive bacteria mediate their mode of action via GyrA in Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli. These are the first examples of compounds in which modes of action in different bacterial pathogens are mediated through widely different targets.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antibiotic activity of 16-membered 9-O-arylalkyloxime macrolides.
AB  - A series of novel 9-O-arylalkyloxime analogs based on three different 16-membered macrolide scaffolds-5-O-mycaminosyltylonolide (OMT), tilmicosin, and 20-deoxy-20-(3,5-dimethyl-1-piperidin-1-yl)-OMT-was synthesized. In vitro antibiotic activities were assayed against Gram-positive Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative Haemophilus influenzae bacterial strains. Analogs derived from OMT (3-15) showed similar or better antibacterial activities against macrolide-susceptible strains and enhanced activities against macrolide-resistant strains compared with erythromycin A, tylosin, or OMT. Similar results were observed for tilmicosin 9-O-arylalkyloxime analogs (18-24). In contrast, most of the 20-deoxy-20-(3,5-dimethyl-1-piperidin-1-yl)-OMT analogs (25-33) showed reduced antibacterial activities compared with OMT. Ribosome-binding studies were performed on compounds 12 (OMT derivative), 20 (tilmicosin derivative), and 29 [20-deoxy-20-(3,5-dimethyl-1-piperidin-1-yl)-OMT derivative]. It was found that these compounds interacted with both domain V and domain II of the Escherichia coli 23S rRNA.
TI  - Characterization of the bifunctional gamma-glutamate-cysteine ligase/glutathione  synthetase (GshF) of Pasteurella multocida.
AB  - Glutamate-cysteine ligase (gamma-ECL) and glutathione synthetase (GS) are the two unrelated ligases that constitute the glutathione biosynthesis pathway in most eukaryotes, purple bacteria, and cyanobacteria. gamma-ECL is a member of the glutamine synthetase family, whereas GS enzymes group together with highly diverse carboxyl-to-amine/thiol ligases, all characterized by the so-called two-domain ATP-grasp fold. This generalized scheme toward the formation of glutathione, however, is incomplete, as functional steady-state levels of intracellular glutathione may also accumulate solely by import, as has been reported for the Pasteurellaceae member Haemophilus influenzae, as well as for certain Gram-positive enterococci and streptococci, or by the action of a bifunctional fusion protein (termed GshF), as has been reported recently for the Gram-positive firmicutes Streptococcus agalactiae and Listeria monocytogenes. Here, we show that yet another member of the Pasteurellaceae family, Pasteurella multocida, acquires glutathione both by import and GshF-driven biosynthesis. Domain architecture analysis shows that this P. multocida GshF bifunctional ligase contains an N-terminal gamma-proteobacterial gamma-ECL-like domain followed by a typical ATP-grasp domain, which most closely resembles that of cyanophycin synthetases, although it has no significant homology with known GS ligases. Recombinant P. multocida GshF overexpresses as an approximately 85-kDa protein, which, on the basis of gel-sizing chromatography, forms dimers in solution. The gamma-ECL activity of GshF is regulated by an allosteric type of glutathione feedback inhibition (K(i) = 13.6 mM). Furthermore, steady-state kinetics, on the basis of which we present a novel variant of half-of-the-sites reactivity, indicate intimate domain-domain interactions, which may explain the bifunctionality of GshF proteins.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of doripenem (S-4661): a global surveillance report (2003).
AB  - The spectrum of activity and potency of doripenem, a broad-spectrum parenteral carbapenem currently in clinical development, was evaluated using 16 008 clinical bacterial isolates collected as part of an international surveillance project during 2003. Using reference broth microdilution methods, doripenem was found to be highly active against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (2705 and 297 isolates, respectively; MIC90s 0.06 mg/L), with a potency greater than that of other carbapenem antibiotics. Against enterococci (1474 isolates), with the exception of Enterococcus faecium, doripenem displayed modest activity (MIC50 4). Doripenem was among the most potent agents tested against Streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci and beta-haemolytic streptococci (885, 140 and 397 isolates; MIC(90)s 0.5, 0.5 and 0.03 mg/L, respectively). For Enterobacteriaceae (> 6200 isolates), doripenem was four- to 32-fold more active than imipenem against wild-type isolates (MIC90s 0.03-0.5 mg/L). MIC90s for confirmed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (121 and 155 isolates; 0.06 and 0.12 mg/L, respectively) were two-fold higher than for wild-type isolates. Doripenem was also active against Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp. and Serratia spp. (MIC90s 0.06-0.25 mg/L), including ceftazidime-resistant isolates. Doripenem and meropenem were the most active agents among all beta-lactams against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (829 isolates; MIC50/90s 0.5/8 and 0.5/16 mg/L, respectively), whereas doripenem and imipenem were the most active agents against Acinetobacter spp. (155 isolates; MIC50/90s 0.5/4 and <or= 0.5/2 mg/L, respectively). Doripenem was slightly more potent (MIC50 2 mg/L) than ertapenem and imipenem (MIC50 4 mg/L), and had a potency similar to that of meropenem (MIC50 2 mg/L), against Burkholderia cepacia (20 isolates). Both Haemophilus influenzae (1824 isolates) and Moraxella catarrhalis (108 isolates), including beta-lactamase-positive isolates, were susceptible to doripenem (MIC90s 0.25 and 0.03 mg/L, respectively). Doripenem displays the favourable characteristics of other carbapenems, and appears to offer certain advantages in terms of potency, spectrum and beta-lactamase stability when compared with some carbapenems used currently to treat nosocomial infections.
TI  - The VIPER elements of trypanosomes constitute a novel group of tyrosine recombinase-enconding retrotransposons.
AB  - VIPER was initially characterized as a 2326bp LTR-like retroelement associated to SIRE, a short interspersed repetitive element specific of Trypanosoma cruzi. It carried a single ORF that coded for a putative reverse transcriptase-RNAse H protein, suggesting that it could be a truncated copy of a longer retroelement. Herein we report the identification and characterization of a complete 4480bp long VIPER in the T. cruzi genome. The complete VIPER harbored three non-overlapped domains encoding for a GAG-like, a tyrosine recombinase and a reverse transcriptase-RNAse H proteins. VIPER elements were also found in the genomes of Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma vivax, but not in Leishmania sp. On the basis of its reverse transcriptase phylogeny, VIPER was classified as an LTR retroelement. However, VIPER was structurally related to the tyrosine recombinase encoding retroelements, DIRS and Ngaro. Phylogenetic analysis showed that VIPER's tyrosine recombinase grouped with the transposases RCI1 of Escherichia coli and Ye24 and Ye72 of Haemophilus influenzae within a major branch of prokaryotic recombinases. Taken together, VIPER's structure, the nature of its tyrosine recombinase, the unique features of its reverse transcriptase catalytic consensus motif and the fact that it was found in Trypanosomes, an early branching eukaryote, suggest that VIPER may be the closest relative of the founder element of the tyrosine recombinase encoding retrotransposons known up to date. Our analysis revealed that tyrosine recombinase-encoding retroelements were originated as early in evolution as non-LTR retroelements and suggests that VIPER, Ngaro and DIRS elements may constitute a third group of retrotransposons, distinct from both LTR and non-LTR retroelements.
TI  - Bacterial etiology of acute otitis media and clinical efficacy of amoxicillin-clavulanate versus azithromycin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common acute bacterial infection in childhood and also the most frequent reason for outpatient antibiotic therapy. Little recent information about susceptibility patterns of AOM bacterial pathogens in Turkish children has been reported. OBJECTIVE: To determine the bacterial etiology of acute otitis media in children and to compare the efficiency of 3 days course of azithromycin with a 10 days course of amoxicillin-clavulanate. METHODS: This prospective, single blind, randomised comparative study was carried out in 180 children with AOM. Paracentesis was performed for middle ear fluid culture before the first dose antibiotic therapy. Children with acute otitis media were randomised to receive either low dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (45/6.4 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for 10 days) or low dose azithromycin (10mg/kg/day for 3 days). Clinical response was assessed on days 2-4, 11-13, 26-28. RESULTS: Bacterial pathogens were isolated from 108 (60%) of 180 children. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common isolated pathogen (39.7%), followed by Haemophilus influenzae (20.7%), Moraxella catarrhalis (15.5%), Staphylococcus aureus (13.8%), Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (5.1%), Escherichia coli (3.4%) and Enterococcus faecalis (1.7%). This study demonstrated low resistance rates compared to studies of different countries. Although clinical response rates were better in patients treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate, this was not statistically significant [86.6% (78 of 90)] versus [95.2% (80 of 84)]. Success rates of amoxicillin-clavulanate were high for both S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. Difference between success rates was not statistically significant (P=0.144 and 0.352). CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria were isolated in 60% of AOM cases. The clinical efficiency of amoxicillin-clavulanate was found to be equal compared to azithromycin in children with acute otitis media.
TI  - The heme-binding lipoprotein (HbpA) of Haemophilus influenzae: role in heme utilization.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae has an absolute growth requirement for heme and a heme binding lipoprotein (HbpA) has been implicated in the utilization of this essential nutrient. HbpA was identified by examining clones from an H. influenzae genomic library that caused Escherichia coli harboring the clone to bind heme. However, HbpA has not been shown to mediate heme acquisition in H. influenzae. We constructed an insertional mutation of hbpA in a nontypeable H. influenzae strain and demonstrated a role for the gene in utilization of multiple heme sources. This is the first report confirming a role for HbpA in utilization of heme.
TI  - Conserved role of the linker alpha-helix of the bacterial disulfide isomerase DsbC in the avoidance of misoxidation by DsbB.
AB  - In the bacterial periplasm the co-existence of a catalyst of disulfide bond formation (DsbA) that is maintained in an oxidized state and of a reduced enzyme that catalyzes the rearrangement of mispaired cysteine residues (DsbC) is important for the folding of proteins containing multiple disulfide bonds. The kinetic partitioning of the DsbA/DsbB and DsbC/DsbD pathways partly depends on the ability of DsbB to oxidize DsbA at rates >1000 times greater than DsbC. We show that the resistance of DsbC to oxidation by DsbB is abolished by deletions of one or more amino acids within the alpha-helix that connects the N-terminal dimerization domain with the C-terminal thioredoxin domain. As a result, mutant DsbC carrying alpha-helix deletions could catalyze disulfide bond formation and complemented the phenotypes of dsbA cells. Examination of DsbC homologues from Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Erwinia chrysanthemi, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Vibrio cholerae (30-70% sequence identity with the Escherichia coli enzyme) revealed that the mechanism responsible for avoiding oxidation by DsbB is a general property of DsbC family enzymes. In addition we found that deletions in the linker region reduced, but did not abolish, the ability of DsbC to assist the formation of active vtPA and phytase in vivo, in a DsbD-dependent manner, revealing that interactions between DsbD and DsbC are also conserved.
TI  - Pyogenic meningitis in Ilesa, Nigeria.
AB  - This study was conducted in 124 children with meningitis to review the etiology,  antimicrobial susceptibility and outcome of disease in a Nigerian tertiary health facility. Of these, 97 (78.27%) were culture positive; in the rest 27(21.8%), diagnosis was based on Gram staining of the CSF. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were isolated in 33.9%, 33.9%, 5.6%, 2.4%, and 2.4% samples respectively. All the isolates had 100 percent; sensitivity to both ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin while the sensitivities to penicillin and ampicillin were remarkably low. The mortality was 33/124 (26.6%) while 16/ 91 (17.6%) of the survivors had various neurologic sequelae.
TI  - A homogeneous, high-throughput fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based DNA polymerase assay.
AB  - A homogeneous, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based DNA polymerase assay that is suitable for high-throughput screening for inhibitors, and can also be used for steady-state kinetic investigations, is described. The activity, kinetic mechanism, and processivity of the isolated alpha subunit of DNA polymerase III, the product of the dnaE gene, from the gram-negative pathogen Haemophilus influenzae were investigated using the FRET assay.
TI  - [Study of pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of levofloxacin].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the dosing regimens of levofloxacin. METHODS: The drug concentrations in serum and urine were assayed by HPLC method and the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated after intravenous infusion of a single dose of 200 mg, 300 mg and 500 mg levofloxacin to healthy volunteers. The in vitro activity MIC of levofloxacin against 823 clinical isolates were determined and compared with other antimicrobial agents. Based on the above results, the PK/PD parameters C(max)/MIC and AUC/MIC were calculated and the dosing regimens of levofloxacin were proposed for infections caused by different pathogens. RESULTS: The results of clinical pharmacokinetic study showed that the C(max) of levofloxacin was 3.4 mg/L +/- 0.8 mg/L, 4.8 mg/L +/- 1.4 mg/L and 7.6 mg/L +/- 1.1 mg/L respectively, AUC(0-infinity) was 14.4 mg.h/L +/- 2.5 mg.h/L, 21.9 mg.h/L +/- 4.5 mg.h/L and 38.3 mg.h/L +/- 4.9 mg.h/L respectively, T(1)/2 beta was 6.2 h +/- 0.4 h, 6.4 h +/- 0.9 h and 6.5 h +/- 0.6 h respectively, and 69% +/- 5%, 69% +/- 6%, and 65% +/- 4% of the doses were excreted in urine within 24 h after intravenous infusion of a single dose of levofloxacin 200 mg, 300 mg and 500 mg. The in vitro pharmacodynamic study showed that levofloxacin was highly active against Hemolytic streptococcus and Moraxella catarrhalis. It was active against Streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin nonsusceptible strains), Hemophilus influenzae, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Klebsiella pneumoniae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Levofloxacin also had good activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and K.pneumoniae. However, most of isolates of enterococcal spp. were resistant to levofloxacin. Above 50% of Escherichia coli isolates were resistant to levofloxacin. Based on the results of PK/PD parameters, the adequate dosing regimens of levofloxacin should be once daily 200 mg once daily of levofloxacin was expected to be effective for the treatment of infections caused by M. catarrhalis. The regimen of 300 mg once daily could be effective for the treatment of infections caused by Hemolytic streptococcus. 500 mg once daily of levofloxacin was expected to be effective for the treatment of respiratory tract infections caused by S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae. For treatment of respiratory tract infections and urinary tract infections caused by levofloxacin-susceptible organisms including K. pneumoniae, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S.maltophilia, 500 mg once daily of levofloxacin was needed to obtain good clinical efficacy. But PK/PD parameters predicted that 500 mg daily of levofloxacin was not effective for infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococci. CONCLUSION: The proposed dosing regimens of levofloxacin based on PK/PD concepts are expected to provide good efficacy in clinical practice.
TI  - [A study of bacterial meningitis in Hokkaido between 1999 and 2003].
AB  - We evaluated 83 children with bacterial meningitis in 67 of 81 insitutions in Hokkaido, Japan between 1999 and 2003 by questionnaire. The incidence of bacterial meningitis in children aged < 5 years and 5 < or =, < 10 years was 6.3 and 0.7 cases per 100, 000 children/year. The incidences of meningitis due to Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus agalactiae in children aged < 5 years were 3.7, 1.4 and 0.8. Median age was 13 months ranging from 0 day to 9 years. Seventy-four (89.1%) of the total were less than 5 years old with 39 (47.0%) less than 1 year old. Major causative organisms were H. influenzae in 51 patients, S. pneumoniae in 18, S. agalactiae in 9 and E. coli in 3. Four deaths occurred, giving an overall case mortality rate of 4.8%. Sequelae were seen at discharge in 25.3%, predominantly epilepsy, hearing loss, and developmental delay of varying severity. The frequency of poor prognosis was 55.6% for patients with meningitis due to S. pneumoniae compared with 21.6% for H. influenzae and 22.2% for S. agalactiae.
TI  - Enzymatic synthesis of cytidine 5'-monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid.
AB  - We have established an efficient method for enzymatic production of cytidine 5'-monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-NeuAc) from inexpensive materials, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and cytidine 5'-monophosphate (CMP). The Haemophilus influenzae nanE gene encoding GlcNAc 6-phosphate (GlcNAc 6-P) 2-epimerase and the Campylobacter jejuni neuB1 gene encoding N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc) synthetase, both of whose products are involved in NeuAc biosynthesis, were cloned and co-expressed in Escherichia coli cells. We examined the synthesis of NeuAc from GlcNAc via GlcNAc 6-P, N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) 6-P, and ManNAc by the use of E. coli cells producing GlcNAc 6-P 2-epimerase and NeuAc synthetase, in expectation of biological functions of E. coli such as the supply of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), which is an essential substrate for NeuAc synthetase, GlcNAc phospholylation by the PEP-dependent phosphotransferase system, and dephospholylation of ManNAc 6-P. Eleven mM NeuAc was synthesized from 50 mM GlcNAc by recombinant E. coli cells with the addition of glucose as an energy source. Next we attempted to synthesize CMP-NeuAc from GlcNAc and CMP using yeast cells, recombinant E. coli cells, and H. influenzae CMP-NeuAc synthetase, and succeeded in efficient production of CMP-NeuAc due to a sufficient supply of PEP and efficient conversion of CMP to cytidine 5'-triphosphate by yeast cells.
TI  - MutH complexed with hemi- and unmethylated DNAs: coupling base recognition and DNA cleavage.
AB  - MutH initiates mismatch repair by nicking the transiently unmethylated daughter strand 5' to a GATC sequence. Here, we report crystal structures of MutH complexed with hemimethylated and unmethylated GATC substrates. Both structures contain two Ca2+ ions jointly coordinated by a conserved aspartate and the scissile phosphate, as observed in the restriction endonucleases BamHI and BglI. In the hemimethylated complexes, the active site is more compact and DNA cleavage is more efficient. The Lys residue in the conserved DEK motif coordinates the nucleophilic water in conjunction with the phosphate 3' to the scissile bond; the same Lys is also hydrogen bonded with a carbonyl oxygen in the DNA binding module. We propose that this Lys, which is conserved in many restriction endonucleases and is replaced by Glu or Gln in BamHI and BglII, is a sensor for DNA binding and the linchpin that couples base recognition and DNA cleavage.
TI  - Fnr-, NarP- and NarL-dependent regulation of transcription initiation from the Haemophilus influenzae Rd napF (periplasmic nitrate reductase) promoter in Escherichia coli K-12.
AB  - Periplasmic nitrate reductase (napFDAGHBC operon product) functions in anaerobic  respiration. Transcription initiation from the Escherichia coli napF operon control region is activated by the Fnr protein in response to anaerobiosis and by the NarQ-NarP two-component regulatory system in response to nitrate or nitrite. The binding sites for the Fnr and phospho-NarP proteins are centered at positions -64.5 and -44.5, respectively, with respect to the major transcription initiation point. The E. coli napF operon is a rare example of a class I Fnr-activated transcriptional control region, in which the Fnr protein binding site is located upstream of position -60. To broaden our understanding of napF operon transcriptional control, we studied the Haemophilus influenzae Rd napF operon control region, expressed as a napF-lacZ operon fusion in the surrogate host E. coli. Mutational analysis demonstrated that expression required binding sites for the Fnr and phospho-NarP proteins centered at positions -81.5 and -42.5, respectively. Transcription from the E. coli napF operon control region is activated by phospho-NarP but antagonized by the orthologous protein, phospho-NarL. By contrast, expression from the H. influenzae napF-lacZ operon fusion in E. coli was stimulated equally well by nitrate in both narP and narL null mutants, indicating that phospho-NarL and -NarP are equally effective regulators of this promoter. Overall, the H. influenzae napF operon control region provides a relatively simple model for studying synergistic transcription by the Fnr and phospho-NarP proteins acting from class I and class II locations, respectively.
TI  - The structural view of bacterial translocation-specific chaperone SecB: implications for function.
AB  - SecB is a molecular chaperone that functions in bacterial post-translational protein translocation pathway. It maintains newly synthesized precursor polypeptide chains in a translocation-competent state and guides them to the translocon via its high-affinity binding to the ligand as well as to the membrane-embedded ATPase SecA. Recent advances in elucidating the structures of SecB have enabled the examination of protein function in the structural context. Structures of SecB from both Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli support the early two-subsite polypeptide-binding model. In addition, the detailed molecular interaction between SecB and SecA was revealed by a structure of SecB in complex with the C-terminal zinc-containing domain of SecA. These observations explain the dual role of SecB plays in the translocation pathway, as a molecular chaperone and a specific targeting factor. A model of SecB-SecA complex suggests that the binding of SecA to SecB changes the conformation of the polypeptide binding sites in the chaperone, enabling transfer of precursor polypeptides from SecB to SecA. Recent studies also show the presence of a second zinc-independent SecB binding site in SecA and the new interaction might contribute to the function of SecB.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of SM-216601, a new broad-spectrum  parenteral carbapenem.
AB  - SM-216601 is a novel parenteral 1beta-methylcarbapenem. In agar dilution susceptibility testing, the MIC of SM-216601 for 90% of the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains tested (MIC(90)) was 2 microg/ml, which was comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid. SM-216601 was also very potent against Enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant strains (MIC(90) = 8 microg/ml). SM-216601 exhibited potent activity against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, with MIC(90)s of less than 0.5 microg/ml, and intermediate activity against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The therapeutic efficacy of SM-216601 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by S. aureus, E. faecium, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa reflected its in vitro activity and plasma level. Thus, SM-216601 is a promising candidate for nosocomial bacterial infections caused by a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens.
TI  - Development of a shuttle vector for Moraxella catarrhalis.
AB  - Efforts to perform genetic analysis in Moraxella catarrhalis have been hampered by the lack of a cloning vector. M. catarrhalis strain E22 was previously shown to contain plasmid pLQ510 which lacked a selectable antibiotic resistance marker. Several methods were used to eliminate unnecessary DNA from pLQ510. Then, a 1.2 kb spectinomycin resistance cartridge, a multiple cloning site, and the origin of replication from pACYC184 were cloned into this plasmid backbone to obtain the 7.2 kb plasmid pWW102B. This new plasmid could replicate in M. catarrhalis as well as in both Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae. This shuttle vector was used to clone and express two different M. catarrhalis genes, respectively, encoding an adhesin and a protein involved in serum resistance. When these two plasmids were introduced into appropriate M. catarrhalis mutants, they complemented the phenotypic deficiency of each mutant. This is the first report of functional complementation in trans in this pathogen.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of ceftriaxone against various clinical strains isolated  in 2004].
AB  - The susceptibility of clinical strains isolated from patients with infection to ceftriaxone (CTRX) and injectable beta-lactam antibiotics was determined in Japanese medical institutions in 2004. The in vitro antibacterial activity of the above antibiotics against clinical strains isolated in 2004 was compared with that against part of the clinical strains isolated about ten years ago (1994 - 1996). The antibacterial activity of CTRX against Streptococcus including penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant Streptocuccus pneumoniae was potent and there were no large differences between clinical strains isolated in 1994 - 1996 and those in 2004 in the antibacterial activity of CTRX. CTRX inhibited the growth of all the strains of Haemophilus influenzae including beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) strains at 0.5 microg/mL or less and showed the potent antibacterial activity against these strains. In addition, since there are no large differences between strains isolated in the past and those isolated in 2004 in the antibacterial activity, CTRX is considered to be a useful antibiotic in the treatment of BLNAR infections which are increased by the causative organism of infections especially in the field of pediatrics in recent years. CTRX showed the excellent antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae but one of the 50 strains of E. coli tested was highly resistant. The antibacterial activity of CTRX against Neisseria gonorrhoeae was the most potent in all the antibiotics tested. These results indicate that CTRX shows excellent antimicrobial activity against fresh strains isolated from patients with infections. CTRX is thus useful as a therapeutic antimicrobial for the treating a variety of infections.
TI  - [Surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to panipenem between 2000 and 2003].
AB  - For the post-marketing surveillance of panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP, Carbenin),  MICs of injectable beta-lactam antibacterials including PAPM against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over Japan are measured yearly and the incidence rates of resistance in various species are also evaluated. In the first surveillance from June 2000 to March 2001, 1,356 isolates of 28 species were tested, 1,221 isolates of the same 28 species were tested in the second surveillance from April 2001 to March 2002, and 1,403 isolates of the same 28 species were tested in the third surveillance from April 2002 to March 2003. No remarkable changes in the activity of PAPM were observed in these surveillances spanning three years. The activity of PAPM in this study was comparable to that in the studies conducted before Carbenin was launched. This result suggests that PAPM still maintains potent activity. In these surveillances spanning three years, the incidence rates of resistance in various species were as follows (2000.6-2001.3 --> 2001.4-2002.3 --> 2002.4-2003.3): methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (39.3% --> 43.9% --> 47.3%), penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae (48.9% --> 44.2% --> 25.7%), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP, 13.8% --> 26.3% --> 43.2%), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (0.9% --> 0% --> 1.4%), ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4% --> 1.3% --> 3.1%), beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae (19.2% --> 8.9% --> 42.9%), beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae (BLNAR, 22.1% --> 30.7% --> 33.0%), and metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.0% --> 4.4% --> 1.0%). PAPM showed the most potent activity among tested drugs against PRSP, whose incidence rate increased notably. BLNAR, whose incidence rates also increased, exhibited low susceptibility to all tested drugs and metallo-beta-lactamase-producing P. aeruginosa also exhibited high resistance. The findings of this surveillance indicate that it is necessary to pay careful attention to the trends of resistant bacteria such as PRSP, BLNAR, and metallo-beta-lactamase producing strains.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of tigecycline tested against organisms causing community-acquired respiratory tract infection and nosocomial pneumonia.
AB  - Emerging antimicrobial resistance among respiratory tract pathogens has created a critical need for development of new antimicrobial agents that are not affected by the commonly occurring genetic resistance mechanisms. Tigecycline, a novel broad-spectrum parenteral glycylcycline, has been shown to be active against many of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, atypical, and anaerobic organisms, including strains highly resistant to commonly prescribed antimicrobials and was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating infections of skin and skin structures, and for intra-abdominal infections. In this study, tigecycline spectrum and potency were evaluated against a global collection of pathogens (2000-2004) recovered from community-acquired respiratory infections (7580 strains) or from hospitalized patients with pneumonia (3183 strains). Among community-acquired infections, the ranking pathogens were Haemophilus influenzae (52.9%; 21% ampicillin-resistant), Streptococcus pneumoniae (39.2%; 23.7% penicillin-nonsusceptible), and Moraxella catarrhalis (7.9%). Tigecycline displayed potent activity by inhibiting 100% of the 3 species at clinically achievable concentrations (2, 1, and 0.5 microg/mL, respectively). The 10 most prevalent pathogens producing 94.3% of pneumonias in hospitalized patients were Staphylococcus aureus (48.5% of strains; 49.4% oxacillin-resistant), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.6%), Klebsiella spp. (5.6%), S. pneumoniae (4.6%), Acinetobacter spp. (4.5%), Enterobacter spp. (4.0%), Escherichia coli (3.8%), Serratia marcescens (2.5%), Enterococcus spp. (2.3%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.8%), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (1.1%). At a concentration of 4 microg/mL, tigecycline inhibited >96% of these pathogens (exception, P. aeruginosa). S. aureus was readily inhibited by tigecycline (MIC50 and MIC90, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/mL, respectively) with all strains inhibited at < or =1 microg/mL. Streptococci recovered from hospitalized patients (beta-hemolytic and S. pneumoniae) were also very susceptible to tigecycline with the highest MIC being 0.12 microg/mL. All E. coli (including 13.3% with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase [ESBL] phenotype) were inhibited by < or =1 microg/mL, and all Klebsiella (25.8% ESBL phenotype) and Enterobacter spp. plus 97.0% of Serratia spp. were inhibited by < or =4 microg/mL. Tigecycline was also active against Acinetobacter spp. and S. maltophilia strains (MIC50 and MIC90, 1 and 4 microg/mL, respectively). Further clinical studies should consider the role that tigecycline may play in the therapy for severe respiratory tract infections, both of nosocomial and community origin.
TI  - Haemophilus influenzae luxS mutants form a biofilm and have increased virulence.
AB  - To gain insight into the role of luxSHi in disease pathogenesis, we inactivated that gene in several non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae isolates with an antibiotic resistance cassette. Gene inactivation was confirmed by PCR and by Southern blot analysis in each strain. Culture filtrates from luxSHi mutants contained a decreased amount of autoinducer-2 (AI-2) activity in comparison to the wild-type isolates using the Vibrio harveyi BB170 bioassay. Culture filtrates from Escherichia coli strain DH5alpha expressing a cloned luxSHi contained 350-fold more AI-2 activity per cell than E. coli DH5alpha containing the vector alone. The growth rate in several liquid media, and the cell density after overnight growth were not significantly different between the parents and the luxSHi mutants. Two clinical H. influenzae and their luxSHi mutants produced an identical biofilm in a flow system. Invasion of human cells by the luxSHi mutants, in comparison to the wild-type parents was strain-dependent, and cell type-dependent, but the luxSHi mutants tended to be more invasive. The luxSHi mutant of an otitis media isolate, strain R3157 appeared more virulent in the chinchilla model of otitis media: there were more bacteria in the middle ear, a greater inflammatory response and more goblet cell hyperplasia 10 days after the inoculation. We conclude that the H. influenzae homologue of luxS modulates certain virulence traits.
TI  - Trends in the epidemiology of neonatal sepsis of vertical transmission in the era of group B streptococcal prevention.
AB  - AIM: To assess trends in the epidemiology of culture-proven and clinical neonatal sepsis of vertical transmission in the era of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. METHODS: Since 1995, the neonatal services of 28 acute-care teaching hospitals in Spain ("Grupo de Hospitales Castrillo") have been involved in the prospective surveillance of neonatal infection of vertical transmission. We here report the comparison of the incidence for the periods 1996-1997 and 2000-2001, and look separately at two groups of hospitals according to the time at which the official hospital policy to provide intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for group B Streptococcus (GBS) prevention was adopted. In 16 hospitals the policy was adopted in 1999 and in 10 before 1998 (nine hospitals in 1996, one in 1997). RESULTS: The incidence of proven sepsis decreased significantly by 22% and 54% in the hospitals that started prophylaxis in 1999 and before 1998, respectively. The incidence of GBS sepsis also declined significantly by 36.4% and 65.4% in both groups of hospitals, respectively. Significant variations in the incidence of clinical vertical sepsis as well as in the incidence of sepsis caused by Haemophilus influenzae and Klebsiella were not found. Sepsis caused by Escherichia coli increased in the hospitals with prophylaxis from 1999 and decreased in those that began prophylaxis before 1998, in which the mortality rate of proven and clinical sepsis also decreased significantly by 58.6%. CONCLUSIONS: There was a substantial decline in the incidence of proven vertical sepsis, with a significant reduction of GBS sepsis, although decreases were more marked when antibiotic prophylaxis was started before 1998. In this group of hospitals, there was also a decrease in the mortality rate. Fluctuations in the incidence of E. coli infection suggest the need for continuing epidemiological surveillance.
TI  - Cys-tRNA(Pro) editing by Haemophilus influenzae YbaK via a novel synthetase.YbaK.tRNA ternary complex.
AB  - Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are multidomain enzymes that often possess two activities to ensure translational accuracy. A synthetic active site catalyzes tRNA aminoacylation, while an editing active site hydrolyzes mischarged tRNAs. Prolyl-tRNA synthetases (ProRS) have been shown to misacylate Cys onto tRNA(Pro), but lack a Cys-specific editing function. The synthetase-like Haemophilus influenzae YbaK protein was recently shown to hydrolyze misacylated Cys-tRNA(Pro) in trans. However, the mechanism of specific substrate selection by this single domain hydrolase is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that YbaK alone appears to lack specific tRNA recognition capabilities. Moreover, YbaK cannot compete for aminoacyl-tRNAs in the presence of elongation factor Tu, suggesting that YbaK acts before release of the aminoacyl-tRNA from the synthetase. In support of this idea, cross-linking studies reveal the formation of binary (ProRS.YbaK) and ternary (ProRS.YbaK.tRNA) complexes. The binding constants for the interaction between ProRS and YbaK are 550 nM and 45 nM in the absence and presence of tRNA(Pro), respectively. These results suggest that the specificity of trans-editing by YbaK is ensured through formation of a novel ProRS.YbaK.tRNA complex.
TI  - Microbiology of Bartholin's gland abscess in Japan.
AB  - This study was conducted to determine the current epidemiology concerning the causative organisms for Bartholin's gland abscess in Japan. Microbiological examination of 224 cases showed positive results in 219 cases and negative results in 5 cases. Of all of the bacterial isolates, 307 and 118 were aerobes and anaerobes, respectively. The most frequently isolated bacterium was Escherichia coli. Of the anaerobes, the most frequently isolated organism was Bacteroides species, followed by Prevotella species. The organisms related to respiratory infectious diseases, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, including resistant bacteria, were sometimes involved between 2000 and 2004.
TI  - Induction of the SOS regulon of Haemophilus influenzae does not affect phase variation rates at tetranucleotide or dinucleotide repeats.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae has microsatellite repeat tracts in 5' coding regions or promoters of several genes that are important for commensal and virulence behaviour. Changes in repeat number lead to switches in expression of these genes, a process referred to as phase variation. Hence, the virulence behaviour of this organism may be influenced by factors that alter the frequency of mutations in these repeat tracts. In Escherichia coli, induction of the SOS response destabilizes dinucleotide repeat tracts. H. influenzae encodes a homologue of the E. coli SOS repressor, LexA. The H. influenzae genome sequence was screened for the presence of the minimal consensus LexA-binding sequence from E. coli, CTG(N)(10)CAG, in order to identify genes with the potential to be SOS regulated. Twenty-five genes were identified that had LexA-binding sequences within 200 bp of the start codon. An H. influenzae non-inducible LexA mutant (lexA(NI)) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. This mutant showed increased sensitivity, compared with wild-type (WT) cells, to both UV irradiation and mitomycin C (mitC) treatment. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR studies confirmed that H. influenzae mounts a LexA-regulated SOS response following DNA assault. Transcript levels of lexA, recA, recN, recX, ruvA and impA were increased in WT cells following DNA damage but not in lexA(NI) cells. Induction of the H. influenzae SOS response by UV irradiation or mitC treatment did not lead to any observable SOS-dependent changes in phase variation rates at either dinucleotide or tetranucleotide repeat tracts. Treatment with mitC caused a small increase in phase variation rates in both repeat tracts, independently of an SOS response. We suggest that the difference between H. influenzae and E. coli with regard to the effect of the SOS response on dinucleotide phase variation rates is due to the absence of any of the known trans-lesion synthesis DNA polymerases in H. influenzae.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of CS-023 (RO4908463), a novel parenteral carbapenem.
AB  - CS-023 (RO4908463, formerly R-115685) is a novel 1beta-methylcarbapenem with 5-substituted pyrrolidin-3-ylthio groups, including an amidine moiety at the C-2 position. Its antibacterial activity was tested against 1,214 clinical isolates of 32 species and was compared with those of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, amikacin, and levofloxacin. CS-023 exhibited a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and -negative aerobes and anaerobes, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CS-023 showed the most potent activity among the compounds tested against P. aeruginosa and MRSA, with MICs at which 90% of isolates tested were inhibited of 4 microg/ml and 8 microg/ml, respectively. CS-023 was stable against hydrolysis by the beta-lactamases from Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris. CS-023 also showed potent activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli. The in vivo efficacy of CS-023 was evaluated with a murine systemic infection model induced by 13 strains of gram-positive and -negative pathogens and a lung infection model induced by 2 strains of PRSP (serotypes 6 and 19). Against the systemic infections with PRSP, MRSA, and P. aeruginosa and the lung infections, the efficacy of CS-023 was comparable to those of imipenem/cilastatin and vancomycin (tested against lung infections only) and superior to those of meropenem, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime (tested against P. aeruginosa infections only). These results suggest that CS-023 has potential for the treatment of nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and -negative pathogens, including MRSA and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Role of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump in determining susceptibility of Haemophilus influenzae to the novel peptide deformylase inhibitor LBM415.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae isolates vary widely in their susceptibilities to the peptide deformylase inhibitor LBM415 (MIC range, 0.06 to 32 microg/ml); however, on average, they are less susceptible than gram-positive organisms, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Insertional inactivation of the H. influenzae acrB or tolC gene in strain NB65044 (Rd strain KW20) increased susceptibility to LBM415, confirming a role for the AcrAB-TolC pump in determining resistance. Consistent with this, sequencing of a PCR fragment generated with primers flanking the acrRA region from an LBM415-hypersusceptible H. influenzae clinical isolate revealed a genetic deletion of acrA. Inactivation of acrB or tolC in several clinical isolates with atypically reduced susceptibility to LBM415 (MIC of 16 microg/ml or greater) significantly increased susceptibility, confirming that the pump is also a determinant of decreased susceptibility in these clinical isolates. Examination of acrR, encoding the putative repressor of pump gene expression, from several of these strains revealed mutations introducing frameshifts, stop codons, and amino acid changes relative to the published sequence, suggesting that loss of pump repression leads to decreased susceptibility. Supporting this, NB65044 acrR mutants selected by exposure to LBM415 at 8 microg/ml had susceptibilities to LBM415 and other pump substrates comparable to the least sensitive clinical isolates and showed increased expression of pump genes.
TI  - NMR assignment of the periplasmic domain of peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein  (Pal) from Haemophilus influenzae.

TI  - Unexpected functional diversity among FadR fatty acid transcriptional regulatory  proteins.
AB  - The FadR protein of Escherichia coli has been shown to play a dual role in transcription of the genes of bacterial fatty acid metabolism. The protein acts as a repressor of beta-oxidation and an activator of unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. FadR DNA binding is antagonized by long chain acyl-CoAs, and thus FadR acts as a sensor of fatty acid availability in the environment. When viewed from a genomic viewpoint, FadR proteins are unusual in that the DNA binding domain is very highly conserved among FadR-containing bacteria, whereas the C-terminal acyl-CoA binding domain shows only weak conservation. To further our understanding of the role of FadR in bacterial lipid metabolism we have examined the in vivo and in vitro properties of a diverse set of FadR proteins expressed in E. coli. In addition to E. coli FadR the proteins examined were those of Salmonella enterica, Vibrio cholerae, Pasteurella multocida, and Haemophilus influenzae. These FadR proteins were found to differ markedly in their effects on repression and induction of beta-oxidation in E. coli and in their acyl-CoA binding abilities as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry. The E. coli and S. enterica proteins were the most similar, although they differed in their effects on utilization of oleic acid and acyl-CoA binding affinities, whereas the P. multocida and H. influenzae proteins showed only weak repression and poor acyl-CoA binding affinities. The V. cholerae FadR was strikingly superior to the other proteins in the amplitude of its regulatory response, and it bound long chain acyl-CoAs appreciably more strongly than the E. coli and S. enterica proteins. The significance of these findings is discussed in view of the protein sequences and the physiological niches occupied by these organisms.
TI  - Functional characterization of the DNA mismatch binding protein MutS from Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - This investigation demonstrates DNA mismatch repair activity in Haemophilus influenzae cell free extracts. The mutS gene as well as purified protein of H. influenzae restored repair activity in complementation assays performed with mutS deficient Escherichia coli strain. The difference in affinity for GT and AC mismatched bases by H. influenzae MutS was reflected in the efficiency with which these DNA heteroduplexes were repaired in vitro, with GT being repaired well and AC the least. Unlike E. coli MutS, the H. influenzae homolog failed to give protein-DNA complex with homoduplex DNA. Interestingly, MutS was found to bind single-stranded DNA but with lesser affinity as compared to heteroduplex DNA. Apart from the nucleotide- and DNA-mediated conformational transitions, as monitored by circular dichroism and limited proteolysis, our data suggest a functional role when H. influenzae MutS encounters single-stranded DNA during exonucleolytic step of DNA repair process. We propose that, conformational changes in H. influenzae MutS not only modulate mismatch recognition but also trigger some of the down stream processes involved in the DNA mismatch repair process.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray crystallographic analysis of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase from Haemophilus influenzae in complex with UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and fosfomycin.
AB  - The bacterial enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase catalyzes the first committed step of peptidoglycan biosynthesis, i.e., transfer of enolpyruvate from phosphoenolpyruvate to UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine. We have overexpressed the enzyme from Haemophilus influenzae in Escherichia coli and crystallized it in the apo-form, as well as in a complex with UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and fosfomycin using ammonium sulfate as the precipitant. X-ray diffraction data from a crystal of the apo-form were collected to 2.8 A resolution at 293 K. The crystal quality was improved by co-crystallization with UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and fosfomycin. X-ray data to 2.2 A have been collected at 100 K from a flash-frozen crystal of the complex. The complex crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group I222 (or I212121) with unit-cell parameters of a = 63.7, b = 124.5, and c = 126.3 A. Assuming a monomer of the recombinant enzyme in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, the calculated Matthews parameter (VM) is 2.71 A3 Da-1 and solvent content is 54.6%.
TI  - Genetic approach to study the relationship between penicillin-binding protein 3 mutations and Haemophilus influenzae beta-lactam resistance by using site-directed mutagenesis and gene recombinants.
AB  - To clarify the relationship between mutations commonly found for penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP 3) of beta-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) Haemophilus influenzae isolates and beta-lactam resistance, single and multiple amino acid mutations at positions 377, 385, 389, 517, and 526 were introduced into PBP 3 of a beta-lactam-susceptible Rd strain by site-directed mutagenesis. Twelve isogenic recombinant strains were challenged with nine beta-lactam antibiotics. Replacement of the asparagine at position 526 with lysine (N526K) increased the resistance to imipenem eightfold and increased the resistance to various cephalosporins two- to eightfold. Substitution of threonine for serine at position 385 (S385T) and/or substitution of phenylalanine for leucine at position 389 (L389F), in addition to the N526K mutation, led to two- to fourfold additional increases in cephalosporin resistance. An isoleucine-to-methionine substitution at position 377 did not change the antibiotic sensitivity of any of the recombinant strains also carrying other PBP 3 mutations tested. Thirty-six clinical isolates carrying a PBP 3 gene (ftsI) with the S385T, L389F, R517H, and/or N526K mutation were chosen from among 279 clinical isolates collected in Japan, and the isolates were grouped into six classes on the basis of the patterns of the four mutations in PBP 3. Rd recombinants were made with each of the ftsI genes. The levels of resistance to beta-lactams varied between recombinants of different classes but were comparable for those of the same class. The levels of resistance to cephalosporins of these recombinants were similar to those of the parent clinical isolates, while those to ampicillin and carbapenems were lower. These results indicate that resistance to beta-lactams, at least to cephalosporins, depends in large part on the PBP 3 mutations R517H, N526K, S385T, and L389F.
TI  - Novel approach to mapping of resistance mutations in whole genomes by using restriction enzyme modulation of transformation efficiency.
AB  - Restriction enzyme modulation of transformation efficiencies (REMOTE) is a method that makes use of genome restriction maps and experimentally observed differences in transformation efficiencies of genomic DNA restriction digests to discover the location of mutations in genomes. The frequency with which digested genomic DNA from a resistant strain transforms a susceptible strain to resistance is primarily determined by the size of the fragment containing the resistance mutation and the distance of the mutation to the end of the fragment. The positions of restriction enzyme cleavage sites immediately flanking the resistance mutation define these parameters. The mapping procedure involves a process of elimination in which digests that transform with high frequency indicate that the restriction enzyme cleavage sites are relatively far away from the mutation, while digests that transform with low frequency indicate that the sites are close to the mutation. The transformation data are compared computationally to the genome restriction map to identify the regions that best fit the data. Transformations with PCR amplicons encompassing candidate regions identify the resistance locus and enable identification of the mutation. REMOTE was developed using Haemophilus influenzae strains with mutations in gyrA, gyrB, and rpsE that confer resistance to ciprofloxacin, novobiocin, and spectinomycin, respectively. We applied REMOTE to identify mutations that confer resistance to two novel antibacterial compounds. The resistance mutations were found in genes that can decrease the intracellular concentration of compounds: acrB, which encodes a subunit of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump; and fadL, which encodes a long-chain fatty acid transporter.
TI  - Investigation of the susceptibility trends in Japan to fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial agents in a nationwide collection of clinical isolates: a longitudinal analysis from 1994 to 2002.
AB  - The susceptibilities of clinical isolates to fluoroquinolones (FQs) and other antimicrobial agents were surveyed to obtain an accurate understanding of the trends in incidence and antimicrobial resistance. The samples were collected from across Japan, biennially, between 1994 and 2002 and a defined level of resistance to FQ determined. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae exhibited stable and high rates of susceptibility to FQ over the period examined. For methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus the rate of resistance to FQ was 80%-90%, markedly higher than that of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. The rate of FQ-resistant Escherichia coli increased rapidly to approximately 10% for samples after 2000. Of 696 E. coli isolates collected in 2002, 13 produced an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), with 6 of 13 ESBL-producing isolates being FQ-resistant. No FQ resistance in clinical isolates of Salmonella spp. was detected in any of the surveys. The rate of FQ resistance to Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from urinary tract and respiratory tract infections was 40%-60% and 15%-25%, respectively.
TI  - Diagnosis of partially treated culture-negative bacterial meningitis using 16S rRNA universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestion.
AB  - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from patients with partially treated and culture-negative meningitis was subjected to PCR using 16S rDNA universal primers followed by restriction endonuclease digestion. In all, 43 patients and 7 controls were enrolled in this study. Twenty-one meningitic samples were positive by PCR. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was the causative agent in seven cases followed by Haemophilus influenzae (four), Streptococcus pneumoniae (two), Listeria monocytogenes (one), Escherichia coli (one), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (one) and Staphylococcus aureus (one). Only two meningitic CSF samples were culture-positive. In this study, PCR using bacterial 16S rDNA specific universal primers was found to be superior to conventional methods in the diagnosis of partially treated meningitis.
TI  - The bacterial YbaK protein is a Cys-tRNAPro and Cys-tRNA Cys deacylase.
AB  - Bacterial prolyl-tRNA synthetases and some smaller paralogs, YbaK and ProX, can hydrolyze misacylated Cys-tRNA Pro or Ala-tRNA Pro. To assess the significance of this quality control editing reaction in vivo, we tested Escherichia coli ybaK for its ability to suppress the E. coli thymidylate synthase thyA:146CCA missense mutant strain, which requires Cys-tRNA(Pro) for growth in the absence of thymine. Missense suppression was observed in a ybaK deletion background, suggesting that YbaK functions as a Cys-tRNA Pro deacylase in vivo. In vitro studies with the full set of 20 E. coli aminoacyl-tRNAs revealed that the Haemophilus influenzae and E. coli YbaK proteins are moderately general aminoacyl-tRNA deacylases that preferentially hydrolyze Cys-tRNA Pro and Cys-tRNA Cys and are also weak deacylases that cleave Gly-tRNA, Ala-tRNA, Ser-tRNA, Pro-tRNA, and Met-tRNA. The ProX protein acted as an aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase that cleaves preferentially Ala-tRNA and Gly-tRNA. The potential of H. influenzae YbaK to hydrolyze in vivo correctly charged Cys-tRNA Cys was tested in E. coli strain X2913 (ybaK+). Overexpression of H. influenzae ybaK decreased the in vivo ratio of Cys-tRNA Cys to tRNA Cys from 65 to 35% and reduced the growth rate of strain X2913 by 30% in LB medium. These data suggest that YbaK-mediated hydrolysis of aminoacyl-tRNA can influence cell growth.
TI  - Comparative in vitro antimicrobial activity of a new carbapenem, doripenem: tentative disc diffusion criteria and quality control.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the spectrum of activity of doripenem and to propose tentative MIC and disc diffusion breakpoints. METHODS: The in vitro susceptibilities of 2137 bacterial isolates, representing 28 different species, to doripenem, imipenem and meropenem were determined by the NCCLS broth microdilution and disc diffusion testing methods. RESULTS: The doripenem MIC(50)s/(90)s were (in mg/L) for Enterobacteriaceae, 0.06/0.25; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 0.25/1; Haemophilus influenzae, 0.12/0.5; streptococci, 0.016/0.5 and for staphylococci, 0.06/4. Like other carbapenems tested, doripenem MIC(50)s/(90)s were >32/>32 and 0.5/32 mg/L for the enterococci and non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli (excluding P. aeruginosa), respectively. Against members of the Enterobacteriaceae and H. influenzae, doripenem was generally more active than imipenem and the same as or slightly less active than meropenem. Values for the non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli excluding P. aeruginosa were comparable for all three carbapenems. Doripenem MICs increased with increasing resistance to methicillin (staphylococci), penicillin (streptococci) and strains that were beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (Haemophilus). Doripenem exhibits excellent activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. The NCCLS disc diffusion test was performed simultaneously on all organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Assuming the MIC susceptible breakpoints for doripenem are < or =1 mg/L for the streptococci and < or =2 mg/L for all other genera, then disc diffusion zone diameter breakpoints can be proposed. In addition, MIC and/or disc diffusion quality control ranges of doripenem were determined for 10 ATCC reference strains.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibilites to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 11,475 clinical isolates obtained from 52 centers in 2002].
AB  - The susceptibilities of bacteria to fluoroquinolones (FQs), especially levofloxacin, and other antimicrobial agents were investigated using 11,475 clinical isolates collected in Japan during 2002. Methicillin susceptible staphylococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, the family of Enterobactericeae, Haemophilus influenzae and Acinetobacter spp. exhibited stable and high susceptibilities to FQs. The rate of FQs-resistant MRSA was 80 approximately 90%, being markedly higher than that of FQs-resistant MSSA. The FQs-resistance rate of MRCNS was also higher than that of MSCNS, however, it was lower than that of MRSA. No FQs-resistant clinical isolates of Salmonella spp. were detected in any of the surveys. Thirteen of Escherichai coli 696 isolates, 8 of Klebsiella pneumoniae 630 isolates and 33 of Proteus mirabilis 373 isolates produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), furthermore 6 of 13 in E. coli, 1 of 8 in K. pneumoniae and 14 of 31 ESBL-producing isolates, and in P. mirabilis were FQs resistant. Attention should be focused in the future on the emergence of ESBL in relation to FQs resistance. The rate of FQs-resistant P. aeruginosa isolated from urinary tract infection (UTI) was 40 approximately 60%, while 15 approximately 25% of isolates from respiratory tract infection (RTI) were resistant. IMP-1 type metallo beta-lactamase producing organisms were found in 49 of P. aeruginosa 1,095 isolates, 7 of S. marcescens 586 isolates and 4 of Acinetobacter spp. 474 isolates, respectively. Glycopeptide-resistant enterococci or S. aureus was not found.
TI  - Future vaccine development at NICHD.
AB  - Using published data and the results of our studies, we hypothesized that a critical level of serum IgG antibodies to the surface structures of invasive pathogens (capsular polysaccharides of Haemophilus influenzae type b, pneumococcus, meningococcus, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus, the O-specific polysaccharide LPS domain of the LPS of Shigella, non-typhoidal Salmonella, and E. coli, and the capsular polypeptide of Bacillus anthraces) confer immunity to these pathogens. Covalent attachment to a protein increases their immunogenicity and bestows T-cell properties to these antigens. We have also shown that a critical level of serum IgG antibodies to pertussis toxin alone induces immunity on both an individual and on a community basis (herd immunity) to Bordetella pertussis. It is likely that all the above conjugates and pertussis toxoid will be incorporated into vaccines for routine infant immunization.
TI  - Remarkable sequence signatures in archaeal genomes.
AB  - Complete archaeal genomes were probed for the presence of long (> or = 25 bp) oligonucleotide repeats (words). We detected the presence of many words distributed in tandem with narrow ranges of periodicity (i.e., spacer length between repeats). Similar words were not identified in genomes of non-archaeal species, namely Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma genitalium and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. BLAST similarity searches against the GenBank nucleotide sequence database revealed that these words were archaeal species-specific, indicating that they are of a signature character. Sequence analysis and genome viewing tools showed these repeats to be restricted to non-coding regions. Thus, archaea appear to possess a non-coding genomic signature that is absent in bacterial species. The identification of a species-specific genomic signature would be of great value to archaeal genome mapping, evolutionary studies and analyses of genome complexity.
TI  - Large scale in vivo synthesis of globotriose and globotetraose by high cell density culture of metabolically engineered Escherichia coli.
AB  - Large amounts of globotriose (Galalpha-4Galbeta-4Glc) are shown to be produced by the high cell density culture of an Escherichia coli strain over-expressing the Neisseria meningitidis lgtC gene for alpha-1,4-Gal transferase. The strain which was devoid of both alpha and beta galactosidase activity was fed with glycerol as the energy and carbon source and with lactose as precursor for globotriose synthesis. After complete exhaustion of lactose, globotriose could serve as an alternative acceptor for LgtC and the formation of a series of polygalactosylated compounds was observed. The system was extended to the synthesis of globotetraose (GalNAcbeta-3Galalpha-4Galbeta-4Glc) by overexpressing two additional genes: lgtD from Haemophilus influenzae Rd which encodes a beta-1,3-GalNAc transferase and wbpP from Pseudomonas aeruginosa which encodes a UDP-GalNAc C4 epimerase. Globotetraose could also be produced from exogenous globotriose which was shown to be actively taken up by the cells.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of oral cephems against various clinically isolated strains and evaluation of efficacy based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics theory].
AB  - We compared the antimicrobial activity of commercially available oral cephem agents, cefaclor (CCL), cefroxadine (CXD), cefdinir (CFDN), cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX), cefteram (CFTM), cefcapene (CFPN), and cefditoren (CDTR), against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and ESBL-producing bacteria isolated from clinical materials in Kansai Medical University Hospital between 2002 and 2003. Based on the Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) theory, we determined the concentration of each agent at which the time above MIC (TAM) value was 40% or more, and calculated the rate of efficacy against each type of bacteria. In S. pneumoniae strains, the MIC(50,80,90) values of CDTR were 0.25, 0.5, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, lower than those of the other agents, demonstrating the most potent antimicrobial activity. However, the efficacy rate for CDTR calculated based on the PK/PD theory was 58.5%. CFTM showed the highest efficacy rate (66.1%). In H. influenzae strains, the antimicrobial activity of CDTR was most potent, followed by that of CFTM and that of CFPN/CFIX. The MIC90 value of CDTR was lowest (0.25 microg/ml), followed by that of CFTM (0.5 microg/ml). The efficacy rate for CDTR was 100%. This result supports that CDTR frequently eradicates H. influenzae. In E. coli strains, the MIC90 values of the above agents, excluding CCL and CXD, ranged from 0.5 to 1 microg/ml. The antimicrobial activity of CFIX against K. pneumoniae was most potent, followed by that of CFDN/CPDX and that of CFTM. In ESBL-producing bacteria, most agents showed an MIC90 value of more than 4 microg/ml. In S. agalactiae and S. pyogenes strains, all of the agents showed satisfactory MIC values. In methi- cillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) strains, CFDN and CXD showed a high efficacy rate, whereas the efficacy rates for the other agents were low. The frequent use of oral agents has increased the number of cephem-resistant bacteria. ESBL-producing bacteria become highly resistant, and the presence or absence of response can be readily evaluated. However, when a mutation of penicillin-binding protein (PBP) occurs, drug resistance is less marked. Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate the treatment response in many cases. In S. pneumoniae strains, the efficacy rates for all of the agents were low in the evaluation using the PK/PD theory, suggesting that a dose higher than the standard dose should be established. Thus, in the future, the efficacy should be evaluated based on the PK/PD theory, appropriate antimicrobial treatment should be administered, and the administration method that does not increase the number of resistant bacteria must be established.
TI  - Otomycoses of candidal origin in eastern Slovakia.
AB  - Mycological analysis of swabs and scraping samples from the external ear canals of 40 patients with clinically diagnosed otomycosis (10 neonates, 30 adults) revealed the presence of fungi as etiological agents. They were investigated microscopically using 20 % potassium hydroxide, and by cultivation on Sabouraud's glucose agar. The Candida species were identified using the germ-tube test, micromorphology observations of colonies on rice agar, and particularly by the commercial kit AUXAcolor. The following Candida species were identified in the aural material examined: C. albicans (n = 21; 52.5 %), C. parapsilosis (11; 27.5), C. tropicalis (3; 7.5), C. krusei (3; 7.5), C. guilliermondii (2; 5.0). The above yeasts were present in samples together with Staphylococcus epidermidis (31), S. aureus (16), alpha-hemolytic streptococci (14), Neisseria spp. (14), Proteus mirabilis (3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Escherichia coli (1) and Haemophilus influenzae (1). The most frequent predisposing factors for otomycosis were swimming in public pools and/or bath, spa and diabetes mellitus.
TI  - Environmental and genetic regulation of the phosphorylcholine epitope of Haemophilus influenzae lipooligosaccharide.
AB  - In response to environmental signals in the host, bacterial pathogens express factors required during infection and repress those that interfere with specific stages of this process. Signalling pathways controlling virulence factors of the human respiratory pathogen, Haemophilus influenzae, are predominantly unknown. The lipooligosaccharide (LOS) outer core represents a prototypical virulence trait of H. influenzae that enhances virulence but also provides targets for innate and adaptive immunity. We report regulation of the display of the virulence-associated phosphorylcholine (PC) epitope on the LOS in response to environmental conditions. PC display is optimal under microaerobic conditions and markedly decreased under conditions of high culture aeration. Gene expression analysis using a DNA microarray was performed to begin to define the metabolic state of the cell under these conditions and to identify genes potentially involved in PC epitope modulation. Global gene expression profiling detected changes in redox responsive genes and in genes of carbohydrate metabolism. The effects on carbohydrate metabolism led us to examine the role of the putative H. influenzae homologue of csrA, a regulator of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis in Escherichia coli. A mutant containing an in-frame deletion of the H. influenzae csrA gene showed increased PC epitope levels under aerobic conditions. Furthermore, deletion of csrA elevated mRNA expression of galU, an essential virulence gene that is critical in generating sugar precursors needed for polysaccharide formation and LOS outer core synthesis. Growth conditions predicted to alter the redox state of the culture modulated the PC epitope and galU expression as well. The results are consistent with a multifactorial mechanism of control of LOS-PC epitope display involving csrA and environmental signals that coordinately regulate biosynthetic and metabolic genes controlling the LOS structure.
TI  - Destabilization of tetranucleotide repeats in Haemophilus influenzae mutants lacking RnaseHI or the Klenow domain of PolI.
AB  - A feature of Haemophilus influenzae genomes is the presence of several loci containing tracts of six or more identical tetranucleotide repeat units. These repeat tracts are unstable and mediate high frequency, reversible alterations in the expression of surface antigens. This process, termed phase variation (PV), enables H.influenzae to rapidly adapt to fluctuations in the host environment. Perturbation of lagging strand DNA synthesis is known to destabilize simple sequence repeats in yeast and Escherichia coli. By using a chromosomally located reporter construct, we demonstrated that the mutation of an H.influenzae rnhA (encoding RnaseHI) homologue increases the mutation rates of tetranucleotide repeats approximately 3-fold. Additionally, deletion of the Klenow domain of DNA polymerase I (PolI) resulted in a approximately 35-fold increase in tetranucleotide repeat-mediated PV rates. Deletion of the PolI 5'>3' exonuclease domain appears to be lethal. The phenotypes of these mutants suggest that delayed or mutagenic Okazaki fragment processing destabilizes H.influenzae tetranucleotide repeat tracts.
TI  - Detection and characterization of horizontal transfers in prokaryotes using genomic signature.
AB  - Horizontal DNA transfer is an important factor of evolution and participates in biological diversity. Unfortunately, the location and length of horizontal transfers (HTs) are known for very few species. The usage of short oligonucleotides in a sequence (the so-called genomic signature) has been shown to be species-specific even in DNA fragments as short as 1 kb. The genomic signature is therefore proposed as a tool to detect HTs. Since DNA transfers originate from species with a signature different from those of the recipient species, the analysis of local variations of signature along recipient genome may allow for detecting exogenous DNA. The strategy consists in (i) scanning the genome with a sliding window, and calculating the corresponding local signature (ii) evaluating its deviation from the signature of the whole genome and (iii) looking for similar signatures in a database of genomic signatures. A total of 22 prokaryote genomes are analyzed in this way. It has been observed that atypical regions make up approximately 6% of each genome on the average. Most of the claimed HTs as well as new ones are detected. The origin of putative DNA transfers is looked for among approximately 12 000 species. Donor species are proposed and sometimes strongly suggested, considering similarity of signatures. Among the species studied, Bacillus subtilis, Haemophilus Influenzae and Escherichia coli are investigated by many authors and give the opportunity to perform a thorough comparison of most of the bioinformatics methods used to detect HTs.
TI  - Bacteremia among children admitted to a rural hospital in Kenya.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are few epidemiologic data on invasive bacterial infections among children in sub-Saharan Africa. We studied every acute pediatric admission to a rural district hospital in Kenya to examine the prevalence, incidence, types, and outcome of community-acquired bacteremia. METHODS: Between August 1998 and July 2002, we cultured blood on admission from 19,339 inpatients and calculated the incidence of bacteremia on the basis of the population served by the hospital. RESULTS: Of a total of 1783 infants who were under 60 days old, 228 had bacteremia (12.8 percent), as did 866 of 14,787 children who were 60 or more days of age (5.9 percent). Among infants who were under 60 days old, Escherichia coli and group B streptococci predominated among a broad range of isolates (14 percent and 11 percent, respectively). Among infants who were 60 or more days of age, Streptococcus pneumoniae, nontyphoidal salmonella species, Haemophilus influenzae, and E. coli accounted for more than 70 percent of isolates. The minimal annual incidence of community-acquired bacteremia was estimated at 1457 cases per 100,000 children among infants under a year old, 1080 among children under 2 years, and 505 among children under 5 years. Of all in-hospital deaths, 26 percent were in children with community-acquired bacteremia. Of 308 deaths in children with bacteremia, 103 (33.4 percent) occurred on the day of admission and 217 (70.5 percent) within two days. CONCLUSIONS: Community-acquired bacteremia is a major cause of death among children at a rural sub-Saharan district hospital, a finding that highlights the need for prevention and for overcoming the political and financial barriers to widespread use of existing vaccines for bacterial diseases.
TI  - Detection and quantification of macrolide resistance mutations at positions 2058  and 2059 of the 23S rRNA gene by pyrosequencing.
AB  - A pyrosequencing method for detection and quantification of macrolide resistance  mutations at positions 2058 and 2059 (Escherichia coli numbering) of the 23S rRNA gene is described. The method was developed and tested for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycobacterium avium, Campylobacter jejuni, and Haemophilus influenzae.
TI  - The binding of MBL to common bacteria in infectious diseases of children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To purify Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) from human serum and detect its  binding ability to several kinds of bacteria common in infectious diseases of children. METHODS: MBL was purified from human serum by affinity chromatography on mannan-Sepharose 4B column. Its binding ability to eight species, 97 strains of bacteria was detected by enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). RESULTS: MBL has different binding ability to bacteria and shows strong binding ability to Klebsiella ornithinolytica and Escherichia coli, but shows relatively lower binding ability to Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterobacter cloacae and Staphylococcus epidermidis. To different isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus, MBL shows quite different binding ability. CONCLUSIONS: MBL has different binding ability to different bacteria, and has relatively stronger binding ability to Gram-negative bacteria. Its binding ability to different isolates of certain kinds of bacteria is quite different.
TI  - PnuC and the utilization of the nicotinamide riboside analog 3-aminopyridine in Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The utilization pathway for the uptake of NAD and nicotinamide riboside was previously characterized for Haemophilus influenzae. We now report on the cellular location, topology, and substrate specificity of PnuC. pnuC of H. influenzae is only distantly related to pnuC of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. When E. coli PnuC was expressed in an H. influenzae pnuC mutant, it was able to take up only nicotinamide riboside and not nicotinamide mononucleotide. Therefore, we postulated that PnuC transporters in general possess specificity for nicotinamide riboside. Earlier studies showed that 3-aminopyridine derivatives (e.g., 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide) are inhibitory for H. influenzae growth. By testing characterized strains with mutations in the NAD utilization pathway, we show that 3-aminopyridine riboside is inhibitory to H. influenzae and is taken up by the NAD-processing and nicotinamide riboside route. 3-Aminopyridine riboside is utilized effectively in a pnuC+ background. In addition, we demonstrate that 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide resynthesis is produced by NadR. 3-Aminopyridine riboside-resistant H. influenzae isolates were characterized, and mutations in nadR could be detected. We also tested other species of the family Pasteurellaceae, Pasteurella multocida and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and found that 3-aminopyridine riboside does not act as a growth inhibitor; hence, 3-aminopyridine riboside represents an anti-infective agent with a very narrow host range.
TI  - [The trend of childhood bacterial meningitis in Japan (2000-2002)].
AB  - We surveyed the epidemiology of bacterial meningitis in pediatrics between July 2000 and December 2002 in Japan and obtained the following results.: The number of cases of bacterial meningitis was 316 (182 boys and 134 girls), which was equivalent to 1.1-1.7 children out of 1,000 hospitalized those in pediatrics per year. The age-distribution for the infections was the highest under 1 year of age and it decreased as the age increased. Haemophilus influenzae was the most common pathogen causing the infections, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae, group B streptococcus, and Escherichia coli. Relationship between causing pathogens and age-distribution was as follows: group B streptococcus and E. coli were major pathogens under 4 months of age and H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae were major pathogens over 4 months of age. Susceptibility tests performed at each facility demonstrated that 53.7% of H. influenzae isolates and 67.7% of S. pneumoniae isolates in 2003 were drug-resistant. As ampicillin and cephem antibiotics are effective against GBS, E. coli and Listeria at present, then the combination of ampicillin and cephem antibiotics was used as first line antibiotics in many facilities under 4 month of age and a combination of carbapenem which showed effective against PRSP and cephem which showed effective against H. influenzae is first choice against childhood bacterial meningitis over 4 month of age.
TI  - Characterization of a dam mutant of Haemophilus influenzae Rd.
AB  - The gene encoding Dam methyltransferase of Haemophilus influenzae was mutagenized by the insertion of a chloramphenicol-resistance cassette into the middle of the Dam coding sequence. This mutant construct was introduced into the H. influenzae chromosome by transformation and selection for Cam(R) transformants. The authors have shown that several phenotypic properties, resistance to antibiotics, dyes and detergent as well as efficiency of transformation, depend on the Dam methylation state of the DNA. Although the major role of the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system is to repair postreplicative errors, it seems that in H. influenzae its effect is more apparent in repairing DNA damage caused by oxidative compounds. In the dam mutant treated with hydrogen peroxide, MMR is not targeted to newly replicated DNA strands and therefore mismatches are converted into single- and double-strand DNA breaks. This is shown by the increased peroxide sensitivity of the dam mutant and the finding that the sensitivity can be suppressed by a mutH mutation inactivating MMR. In the dam mutant treated with nitrofurazone the resulting damage is not converted into DNA breaks but the high sensitivity is also suppressed by a mutH mutation.
TI  - ATP-induced structural change of dephosphocoenzyme A kinase from Thermus thermophilus HB8.
AB  - Dephosphocoenzyme A kinase (DCK) catalyzes phosphorylation in the final step of coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis. In this phosphorylation process, domain movements play a very important role. To reveal the structural changes induced by ligand binding, we determined the crystal structure of DCK from Thermus thermophilus HB8 by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method at 2.8 A. The crystal structure includes three independent protein molecules in the asymmetric unit: One is a liganded form and the others are unliganded. The topology shows a canonical nucleotide-binding protein possessing the P-loop motif. A structure homology search by DALI revealed the similarity of the DCKs from T. thermophilus HB8, Haemophilus influenzae, and Escherichia coli. Structural comparisons between the liganded and unliganded forms of DCK from T. thermophilus HB8 indicated domain movements induced by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding. For the domain movements, proline residues confer flexibility at the domain linkages. In particular, Pro91 plays an important role in moving the CoA domain.
TI  - Nucleotide-dependent substrate handoff from the SspB adaptor to the AAA+ ClpXP protease.
AB  - The SspB adaptor enhances ClpXP degradation by binding the ssrA degradation tag of substrates and the AAA+ ClpX unfoldase. To probe the mechanism of substrate delivery, we engineered a disulfide bond between the ssrA tag and SspB and demonstrated otherwise normal interactions by solving the crystal structure. Although the covalent link prevents adaptor.substrate dissociation, ClpXP degraded GFP-ssrA that was disulfide bonded to the adaptor. Thus, crosslinked substrate must be handed directly from SspB to ClpX. The ssrA tag in the covalent adaptor complex interacted with ClpX.ATPgammaS but not ClpX.ADP, suggesting that handoff occurs in the ATP bound enzyme. By contrast, SspB alone bound ClpX in both nucleotide states. Similar handoff mechanisms will undoubtedly be used by many AAA+ adaptors and enzymes, allowing assembly of delivery complexes in either nucleotide state, engagement of the recognition tag in the ATP state, and application of an unfolding force to the attached protein following hydrolysis.
TI  - FtsK activities in Xer recombination, DNA mobilization and cell division involve  overlapping and separate domains of the protein.
AB  - Escherichia coli FtsK is a multifunctional protein that couples cell division and chromosome segregation. Its N-terminal transmembrane domain (FtsK(N)) is essential for septum formation, whereas its C-terminal domain (FtsK(C)) is required for chromosome dimer resolution by XerCD-dif site-specific recombination. FtsK(C) is an ATP-dependent DNA translocase. In vitro and in vivo data point to a dual role for this domain in chromosome dimer resolution (i) to directly activate recombination by XerCD-dif and (ii) to bring recombination sites together and/or to clear DNA from the closing septum. FtsK(N) and FtsK(C) are separated by a long linker region (FtsK(L)) of unknown function that is highly divergent between bacterial species. Here, we analysed the in vivo effects of deletions of FtsK(L) and/or of FtsK(C), of swaps of these domains with their Haemophilus influenzae counterparts and of a point mutation that inactivates the walker A motif of FtsK(C). Phenotypic characterization of the mutants indicated a role for FtsK(L) in cell division. More importantly, even though Xer recombination activation and DNA mobilization both rely on the ATPase activity of FtsK(C), mutants were found that can perform only one or the other of these two functions, which allowed their separation in vivo for the first time.
TI  - Inhibition of bovine macrophage and polymorphonuclear leukocyte superoxide anion  production by Haemophilus somnus.
AB  - Virulent strains of the bovine opportunistic pathogen Haemophilus somnus (Histophilus somni) cause multi-systemic diseases in cattle. One of the reported virulence factors that H. somnus may use to persist in the host is resistance to intracellular killing. We report here that H. somnus significantly (P < 0.001) inhibited production of superoxide anion (O2-) by bovine mammary and alveolar macrophages as well as by polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Inhibition of O2- was time- and dose-dependent and did not occur after incubation with Escherichia coli, H. influenzae, or Brucella abortus. Non-viable H. somnus, purified lipooligosaccharide, or cell-free supernatant from mid-log phase cultures did not inhibit O2- production, indicating that O2- inhibition required contact with live H. somnus. Furthermore, preincubation of phagocytic cells with cytochalasin B to prevent phagocytosis did not decrease the ability of H. somnus to inhibit O2- production. Some H. somnus isolates from the prepuce of healthy bulls were less capable or incapable of inhibiting macrophage O2- production compared to isolates tested from disease sites. Our results suggest that inhibition of O2- may be an important virulence factor exploited by pathogenic strains of H. somnus to resist killing by professional phagocytic cells.
TI  - [Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance: VIRA study 2004].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of the study was to know the current situation of the antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of the main multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the VIRA study carried out in 2001. METHODS: The 40 participating hospitals sent a total of 1,425 microorganisms isolated in February 2004, distributed as follows: penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (139), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (289), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (158), ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (89) and Enterococcus faecalis (2), ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae (85), ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli (346), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (187), and Acinetobacter baumannii (130). The hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. Sensitivity was determined by the broth microdilution method. RESULTS: The number of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci fell significantly (p < 0.0001) compared with the previous study (from 59.8% to 30.2%). Global methicillin-resistance in S. aureus was 31.2%, which represents a significant increase (p < 0.001) compared with the year 2001 (24.8%). 11.3% of the E. coli strains were extended-spectrum beta -lactamase-producers and came from 24 hospitals. One P. aeruginosa isolate gave a positive result in the E-test MBL assay, suggesting the presence of metallo-beta -lactamases. The strains of imipenem-resistant A. baumannii presented cross-resistance with several antibiotics. CONCLUSION: These results show how the multi-resistant bacteria included in the study represent a growing problem in our hospitals. This emphasizes the importance of resistance surveillance systems and the correct use of antimicrobial agents.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of cefdinir against isolates of respiratory tract pathogens in children].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the in vitro antibacterial activity of cefdinir against clinical isolates of respiratory tract pathogens in Children. METHODS: MIC values of cefdinir against 380 strains were determined with E-test method and compared with those of cefaclor. RESULTS: All penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP) strains were also susceptible to cefdinir and cefaclor. Both cefdinir and cefaclor were not active against penicillin-resistant SP (PRSP). Against penicillin-intermediate SP (PISP) the susceptibility rates of cefdinir and cefaclor were 70.1% and 57.4%, respectively. The activity of cefdinir and cefaclor against beta-lactamases negative Hemophilus influenzae (HI) was excellent, but the susceptibility rates of cefdinir and cefaclor against beta-lactamases positive HI were 85.0% and 70.0%, respectively with MIC(90) of 1.5 mg/L vs. 256.0 mg/L. Cefdinir presented higher activities and lower MIC values than cefaclor against Moraxella catarrhalis (MC), Group A streptococcus (GAS), methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) or Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pn). Both cefdinir and cefaclor were not susceptible to ESBLs positive E. coli and K. pn. CONCLUSIONS: Cefdinir exhibits excellent activity against PSSP, PISP, HI, as well as MC, GAS, MSSA and ESBLs negative E. coli or K. pn.
TI  - [Rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16SrDNA oligonucleotide array].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. However conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. On the basis of special gene sequence, PCR provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. But it is difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic agents. Oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of target genes. The objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the PCR product of 16SrDNA using a pair of universal primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: By comparison and analysis of the 16SrDNA sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. A pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, Hemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. The probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of PCR using the universal primers. RESULTS: The universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, Neisseria meningitides, Citrobacter freundii, Bacillus subtilis, and Salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human DNA as control. The results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could not hybridize with other bacteria. The lowest concentration of DNA (product of PCR) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. The results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. The results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. From the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system, which contains amplification of the segment of 16rDNA from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of PCR products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - [Rapid diagnosis of neonatal sepsis by 16SrRNA genes PCR amplification and genechip hybridization].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore a method for rapid diagnosis of sepsis in newborn infants.  METHODS: (1) The primers and oligonucleotide probes were designed and synthesized based on the sequences of bacterial 16SrRNA gene. The gene chip was prepared through the probes printed onto special glass slides. The gene chip included 18 special probes: universal probe 1, universal probe 2, Gram positive bacterial probe, Gram negative bacterial probe 1, Gram negative bacterial probe 2, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (CoNS) 1, CoNS 2, Escherichia coli, Hemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus, Meningococcus, Corynebacterium, Propionibacterium; (2) Blood specimens from 285 cases of suspected septicemia were cultured and bacterial 16S rRNA gene was detected separately; DNA isolated from blood specimens and cerebrospinal fluid was amplified by PCR, and PCR products were hybridized with the probes on the gene chips. Hybridization results were scanned and read by laser-scanner. RESULTS: (1) Of the 285 cases, 17 were positive by PCR and the positive rate (5.96%) was significantly higher than that of blood culture (2.81%) (P < 0.01). When blood culture was taken as control, the sensitivity of PCR was 100% and Specificity was 96.75%, the index of accurate diagnosis was 0.968. (2) The 17 specimens which showed positive results by PCR were further hybridized on the gene chip. All were positive by universal probes. Among all of them, 5 were positive by E. coli probe; 4 were positive by Staphylococcus epidermidis; two were positive by Bacillus and Propionibacterium probes, separately; 4 were positive by CoNS. The 8 specimens which showed positive results by both PCR and blood culture, the result of gene chip hybridization coincided with the result of blood culture. CONCLUSION: Detection of the bacterial 16SrRNA genes in clinical specimens by gene chip hybridization technology can diagnose neonatal septicemia rapidly. This method has higher sensitivity and specificity than blood culture or other methods and can provide a rapid way for the etiological diagnosis of neonatal septicemia. Therefore the genechip method may be valuable and practical in early diagnosis of neonatal septicemia.
TI  - DNA mismatch correction in Haemophilus influenzae: characterization of MutL, MutH and their interaction.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae DNA mismatch repair proteins, MutS, MutL and MutH, are functionally characterized in this study. Introduction of mutS, mutL and mutH genes of H. influenzae resulted in complementation of the mismatch repair activity of the respective mutant strains of Escherichia coli to varying levels. DNA binding studies using H. influenzae MutH have shown that the protein is capable of binding to any DNA sequence non-specifically in a co-operative and metal independent manner. Presence of MutL and ATP in the binding reaction resulted in the formation of a more specific complex, which indicates that MutH is conferred specificity for binding hemi-methylated DNA through structural alterations mediated by its interaction with MutL. To study the role of conserved amino acids Ile213 and Leu214 in the helix at the C-terminus of MutH, they were mutated to alanine. The mutant proteins showed considerably reduced DNA binding and nicking, as well as MutL-mediated activation. MutH failed to nick HU bound DNA whereas MboI and Sau3AI, which have the same recognition sequence as MutH, efficiently cleaved the substrate. MutS ATPase activity was found to be reduced two-fold in presence of covalently closed circular duplex containing a mismatched base pair whereas, the activity was regained upon linearization of the circular duplex. This observation possibly suggests that the MutS clamps are trapped in the closed DNA heteroduplex. These studies, therefore, serve as the basis for a detailed investigation of the structure-function relationship among the protein partners of the mismatch repair pathway of H. influenzae.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial properties of aqueous garlic extract against multidrug-resistant bacteria and Candida species from Nigeria.
AB  - The antimicrobial effects of aqueous garlic extract (AGE) against 133 multidrug-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial isolates, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., and Proteus spp., and against 10 Candida spp. were studied. Antibacterial activity of AGE by well-diffusion and macrobroth dilution method was characterized by inhibition zones of 20.2-22.7 mm for gram-positives and 19.8-24.5 mm for gram-negatives and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranges of 15.6-48.3 mg/mL and 22.9-37.2 mg/mL, respectively. With the exception of P. aeruginosa, the observed disparity in MIC values at 24 and 48 hours was not significant (P >.05) in these isolates. The anticandidal effect of AGE resulted in a growth inhibition zone of 27.4 +/- 3.7 mm with no significant difference (P >.05) in MIC values at 24 and 48 hours, respectively. Minimum fungicidal concentrations were found to be 14.9 and 15.5 mg/mL, respectively, at these incubation periods. Further analysis revealed the antimicrobial efficacy of AGE to be dose and time dependent, producing five distinct time-kill profiles among the isolates tested. The results of this study support the use of garlic in health products and herbal remedies in Nigeria.
TI  - Haemophilus influenzae UvrA: overexpression, purification, and in cell complementation.
AB  - UvrA protein is a major component of ABC endonuclease complex involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER) mechanism. Although NER system is best characterized in Escherichia coli, not much information is available in Haemophilus influenzae. However, based on amino acid homology, uvrA ORF has been identified on H. influenzae genome [gene identification No. HI0249, Science 269 (1995) 496]. H. influenzae Rd uvrA ORF was cloned and overexpressed in E. coli. The expressed UvrA protein was purified using a two-step column chromatography protocol to a single band of expected molecular weight (104 kDa) and characterized for its ATPase and DNA binding activity. In addition, when H. influenzae uvrA was introduced in E. coli uvrA mutant strain AB1886, its UV resistance was restored to near wild type level.
TI  - Genomic subtraction for the identification of putative new virulence factors of an avian pathogenic Escherichia coli strain of O2 serogroup.
AB  - To identify putative new virulence factors of avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) strains, a genomic subtraction was performed between the APEC strain MT512 and the non-pathogenic E. coli strain of avian origin EC79. Seventeen DNA fragments were cloned that were specific for the APEC strain. Among them, nine were identified that were more frequent among pathogenic than non-pathogenic isolates in a collection of 67 avian E. coli. Chromosome or plasmid location, and the nucleotide sequence of these nine fragments were characterized. Four fragments were plasmid-located. The nucleotide sequence of two of them exhibited identity with the sequence of the RepF1B replicon of E. coli plasmids, and the amino-acid deduced sequences from the two other fragments exhibited similarity to the products of genes sitA of Salmonella Typhimurium and iroD of E. coli, which are involved in iron metabolism. Of the five chromosome-located fragments, three were predicted to encode parts of proteins that were significantly homologous to previously described proteins: TktA (transketolase) of Haemophilus influenzae, a FruA (fructokinase) homologue of Listeria innocua and Gp2 (large terminal subunit) of phage 21. The putative products of the two other chromosome-located fragments were homologous to proteins with unknown functions: Z0255 of E. coli strain EDL933 (EHEC) and RatA of Salmonella Typhimurium strain LT2. Both these chromosomal fragments, whose presence is correlated with serogroups O1 and O2 and to the virulence of APEC strains belonging to these serogroups, are good candidates for being part of novel virulence determinants of APEC. Moreover, several fragments were shown to be located close to tRNA selC, asnT or thrW, which suggests they could be part of pathogenicity islands. Six fragments that were shown to be part of whole ORFs present in the APEC strain MT 512 were also present in extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) strains of human and animal origin. Thus, the putative novel virulence factors identified in this study could be shared by ExPEC strains of different origins.
TI  - [Isolation rate of gram negative microflora and its sensitivity to antibiotics in hemoblastosis patients].
AB  - A total of 67 patients with blood system diseases and infectious complications were examined. During the period of the examination 139 microorganisms were isolated. Of these gram negative microorganisms constituted 51%, gram positive microorganisms--34.8% and fungal flora--14.2%. Most frequently the following gram negative microorganisms were isolated from the patients: Pseudomonas sp. (including P. aeruginosa), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae. All isolated microorganisms retained sensitivity to imipenem, with the exception of individual strains of Pseudomonas sp.; the latter exhibited sensitivity to amicacin and ceftazidim. Cefotaxime was active with respect to 75% of K. pneumoniae strains and all E. coli strains, ciprofloxacin was active with respect to 43% of E. coli strains, 80% of K. pneumoniae strains and 83.4% of Pseudomonas sp. strains, cefepim was active with respect to 85.7% of Pseudomonas sp. strains and all E. coli strains, ceftazidim was active with respect to all Pseudomonas sp. and E. coli strains. 75% of K. pneumoniae strains, 77.8% of Pseudomonas sp. strains and 86% of E. coli strains retained sensitivity to amicacin. 25% of K. pneumoniae strains required testing for ESBL production.
TI  - Cloning and overproduction of the rpoZ gene encoding an RNA polymerase omega subunit from a deep-sea piezophilic Shewanella violacea strain DSS12.
AB  - We have cloned the rpoZ gene, encoding RNA polymerase omega protein, by PCR approach from the deep-sea piezophilic and psychrophilic bacterium, Shewanella violacea strain DSS12. The cloned gene, 285bp in length, was found to encode a protein consisting of 94 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 10,327 Da. Significant homology was evident comparing the RpoZ protein of S. violacea with that of Shewanella oneidensis (69% identity), Vibrio cholerae (65% identity), Escherichia coli K-12 (64% identity) and Haemophilus influenzae (61% identity). From the Northern blot analysis, S. violacea rpoZ gene was expressed constitutively under pressure conditions of 0.1, 30 and 50MPa. We constructed expression plasmid to overproduce the RpoZ protein and transformed into E. coli JM109 as a host of overproduction. Upon induction, the recombinant protein encoded by plasmid pQrpoZ was overexpressed and purified using Ni2+ affinity column.
TI  - The hFbpABC transporter from Haemophilus influenzae functions as a binding-protein-dependent ABC transporter with high specificity and affinity for ferric iron.
AB  - Pathogenic Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria spp. (Neisseria gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis), Serratia marcescens, and other gram-negative bacteria utilize a periplasm-to-cytosol FbpABC iron transporter. In this study, we investigated the H. influenzae FbpABC transporter in a siderophore-deficient Escherichia coli background to assess biochemical aspects of FbpABC transporter function. Using a radiolabeled Fe3+ transport assay, we established an apparent Km=0.9 microM and Vmax=1.8 pmol/10(7)cells/min for FbpABC-mediated transport. Complementation experiments showed that hFbpABC is dependent on the FbpA binding protein for transport. The ATPase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of FbpABC transport, while the protonmotive-force-inhibitor carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone had no effect. Metal competition experiments demonstrated that the transporter has high specificity for Fe3+ and selectivity for trivalent metals, including Ga3+ and Al3+, over divalent metals. Metal sensitivity experiments showed that several divalent metals, including copper, nickel, and zinc, exhibited general toxicity towards E. coli. Significantly, gallium-induced toxicity was specific only to E. coli expressing FbpABC. A single-amino-acid mutation in the gene encoding the periplasmic binding protein, FbpA(Y196I), resulted in a greatly diminished iron binding affinity Kd=5.2 x 10(-4) M(-1), approximately 14 orders of magnitude weaker than that of the wild-type protein. Surprisingly, the mutant transporter [FbpA(Y196I)BC] exhibited substantial transport activity, approximately 35% of wild-type transport, with Km=1.2 microM and Vmax=0.5 pmol/10(7)cells/min. We conclude that the FbpABC complexes possess basic characteristics representative of the family of bacterial binding protein-dependent ABC transporters. However, the specificity and high-affinity binding characteristics suggest that the FbpABC transporters function as specialized transporters satisfying the strict chemical requirements of ferric iron (Fe3+) binding and membrane transport.
TI  - Structure of DsbC from Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Bacterial DsbC proteins are involved in rearranging or reducing mismatched disulfide bonds folding within the periplasm. The X-ray structure of the enzyme from Haemophilus influenzae has been solved and compared with the known structure of the Escherichia coli protein. The proteins act as V-shaped dimers with a large cleft to accommodate substrate proteins. The dimers are anchored by a small N-terminal domain, but have a flexible linker region which allows the larger C-terminal domain, with its reactive sulfhydryls, to clamp down on substrates. The overall folds are very similar, but the comparison shows a wider range of hinge motions than previously thought. The crystal packing of the H. influenzae protein allows the movement of the N-terminal domain with respect to the C-terminal domain through motions in the flexible hinge, generating high thermal parameters and unusually high anisotropy in the crystallographic data.
TI  - Probing the active site of YjeE: a vital Escherichia coli protein of unknown function.
AB  - In the study described here, we have taken steps to characterize the YjeE protein, an Escherichia coli protein of unknown function that is essential for bacterial viability. YjeE represents a protein family whose members are broadly conserved in bacteria, absent from eukaryotes and contain both Walker A and B motifs, characteristic of P-loop ATPases. We have revisited the dispensability of the yjeE gene in E. coli and describe efforts to probe the function of the YjeE protein with in vitro biochemistry. We have looked critically for ATPase activity in the recombinant E. coli protein and have made vigilant use of site-directed variants in the Walker A [K41A (Lys41-->Ala) and T42A] and putative Walker B (D80Q) motifs. We noted that any hydrolysis of ATP by the wild-type E. coli protein might be attributed to background ATPase, since it was not appreciably different from that of the variants. To overcome potential contaminants, we turned to crystalline pure YjeE protein from Haemophilus influenzae that was found to hydrolyse ATP at a slow rate (kcat=1 h(-1)). We have also shown high-affinity binding to YjeE by ADP using equilibrium dialysis (K(d)=32 microM) and by fluorescence resonance energy transfer from a conserved tryptophan in YjeE to a fluorescent derivative of ADP, 2'-/3'-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)adenosine 5'-O-diphosphate (K(d)=8 microM). Walker motif variants were notably impaired for ADP binding and T42A and D80Q mutations in yjeE were incapable of complementing the yjeE deletion strain.
TI  - Successful induction of protective antibody responses against Haemophilus influenzae type b and diphtheria after transcutaneous immunization with the glycoconjugate polyribosyl ribitol phosphate-cross-reacting material 197 vaccine.
AB  - We examined the antibody responses elicited in rats after transcutaneous immunization (TCI) with the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib)-cross-reacting material (CRM(197)) glycoconjugate vaccine coadministered with cholera toxin or mutants of heat-labile enterotoxin of Escherichia coli (LTK63 and LTR72) as adjuvants. The glycoconjugate vaccine was immunogenic, eliciting high antibody responses to the capsular polysaccharide of Hib and to diphtheria toxin. Passively transferred immune serum protected infant rats against challenge with the Hib Eagan strain and exhibited strong neutralizing activity against diphtheria toxin both in vitro and in vivo. The finding that TCI of rats can elicit antibody responses surpassing the minimum levels required for protective immunity against Hib and diphtheria suggests that this immunization strategy holds a lot of promise for future pediatric use. However, further studies are required to confirm the potential of TCI with glycoconjugate vaccines in humans.
TI  - Reduction of nasal colonization of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae following intranasal immunization with rLP4/rLP6/UspA2 proteins combined with aqueous formulation of RC529.
AB  - Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) and Moraxella catarrhalis are common causative agents of human mucosal infections. To formulate a mucosal vaccine against these pathogens, recombinant lipidated P4 (rLP4) and P6 (rLP6) proteins of NTHi and ubiquitous cell surface protein A (UspA) of M. catarrhalis were used for active immunization experiments in a mouse nasal challenge model. BALB/c mice were immunized intranasally with these proteins formulated with a chemically synthesized adjuvant, RC529 in an aqueous formulation (RC529-AF). Three weeks after the last immunization, these animals were challenged intranasally with NTHi strain SR7332.P1 and nasal colonization measured 3 days later. To determine local and systemic immune responses, bronchoalveolar washes (BAW) and sera were collected prior to NTHi challenge. The serum and mucosal samples were analyzed by ELISA for rLP4, rLP6 and UspA2 protein-specific IgG, IgG subclass and IgA antibody titers and bactericidal titers were determined against the TTA24 and 430-345 strains of M. catarrhalis. Results of these experiments show that these proteins combined with RC529-AF administered intranasally to mice elicited (1) significantly increased rLP4/rLP6/UspA2 protein-specific circulating IgG and IgA antibody responses; (2) local rLP4/rLP6/UspA2-specific IgA responses in the respiratory tract; and (3) more than a two log reduction of nasal colonization of NTHi strain SR7332 from the nasal tissues of mice. The serum IgG subclass distribution was predominantly IgG2a, representing a Th1 response. The antiserum also exhibited bactericidal activities to several strains of M. catarrhalis. These data indicate that intranasal immunization with rLP4/rLP6/UspA2 proteins combined with RC529-AF may be able to provide a way for inducing local mucosal immunity and for prevention of otitis media in children.
TI  - [Microbiology of acute exacerbation chronic sinusitis in adults].
AB  - The bacterial flora taken by sinus puncture from 115 patients with uni and bilateral acute exacerbation of chronic maxillary sinusitis was analyzed. Germ-free culture was obtained in 49 cases (40%) and in 69 cases (60%) bacteria were isolated from all sinus aspirates. Microbiological evaluation shows, that in majority of cases (90%) of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis there were pathogenic bacteria namely aerobic and anaerobic. The most frequent pathogens isolated from the aspirates were; Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus hominis, Propionibacterium acnes i Candida albicans. The culture analysis proves that one or more pathogens can be the etiological factor. In the majority of cases (64%) the sinusitis is caused by monoculture.
TI  - Investigating the antimicrobial activity of natural honey and its effects on the  pathogenic bacterial infections of surgical wounds and conjunctiva.
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of 10-100% (wt/vol) concentrations of new honey, stored  honey, heated honey, ultraviolet-exposed honey, and heated stored honey were tested against common human pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Entrobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella dysenteriae, Klebsiella sp., Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus hemolyticus group B, and Candida albicans. Antimicrobial activity of honey was tested in acidic, neutral, or alkaline media. These were compared with similar concentrations of glucose in nutrient broth. Surgical wounds were made on the dorsum of mice and infected with S. aureus or Klebsiella sp. The wounds were treated with local application of honey four times a day or appropriate antibiotics and compared with control values. Bacterial conjunctivitis due to E. coli, Proteus sp., S. aureus, Klebsiella sp., and P. aeruginosa was induced in rats. Conjunctival application of honey four times a day or appropriate antibiotics was used for treatment and compared with control values. Growth of all the isolates was completely inhibited by 30-100% honey concentrations. The most sensitive microbes were E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and H. influenzae. Glucose showed less antimicrobial activity than honey, and many microbes showed positive culture even in 100% glucose. Heating to 80 degrees C for 1 hour decreased antimicrobial activity of both new and stored honey. Storage of honey for 5 years decreased its antimicrobial activity, while ultraviolet light exposure increased its activity against some of the microorganisms. Antimicrobial activity of honey was stronger in acidic media than in neutral or alkaline media. Single doses of honey used to prepare the 60% concentration in nutrient broth were bacteriocidal for P. aeruginosa and bacteriostatic for S. aureus and Klebsiella sp. during certain periods. Local application of raw honey on infected wounds reduced redness, swelling, time for complete resolution of lesion, and time for eradication of bacterial infection due to S. aureus or Klebsiella sp. Its potency was comparable to that of local antibiotics. Honey application into infective conjunctivitis reduced redness, swelling, pus discharge, and time for eradication of bacterial infections due to all the isolates tested.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae putative toxin-antitoxin locus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Certain strains of an obligate parasite of the human upper respiratory tract, nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), can cause invasive diseases such as septicemia and meningitis, as well as chronic mucosal infections such as otitis media. To do this, the organism must invade and survive within both epithelial and endothelial cells. We have identified a facilitator of NTHi survival inside human cells, virulence-associated protein D (vapDHi, encoded by gene HI0450). Both vapDHi and a flanking gene, HI0451, exhibit the genetic and physical characteristics of a toxin/antitoxin (TA) locus, with VapDHi serving as the toxin moiety and HI0451 as the antitoxin. We propose the name VapXHi for the HI0451 antitoxin protein. Originally identified on plasmids, TA loci have been found on the chromosomes of a number of bacterial pathogens, and have been implicated in the control of translation during stressful conditions. Translation arrest would enhance survival within human cells and facilitate persistent or chronic mucosal infections. RESULTS: Isogenic mutants in vapDHi were attenuated for survival inside human respiratory epithelial cells (NCI-H292) and human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC), the in vitro models of mucosal infection and the blood-brain barrier, respectively. Transcomplementation with a vapDHi allele restored wild-type NTHi survival within both cell lines. A PCR survey of 59 H. influenzae strains isolated from various anatomical sites determined the presence of a vapDHiallele in 100% of strains. Two isoforms of the gene were identified in this population; one that was 91 residues in length, and another that was truncated to 45 amino acids due to an in-frame deletion. The truncated allele failed to transcomplement the NTHi vapDHi survival defect in HBMEC. Subunits of full-length VapDHi homodimerized, but subunits of the truncated protein did not. However, truncated protein subunits did interact with full-length subunits, and this interaction resulted in a dominant-negative phenotype. Although Escherichia coli does not contain a homologue of either vapDHi or vapXHi, overexpression of the VapDHi toxin in trans resulted in E. coli cell growth arrest. This arrest could be rescued by providing the VapXHi antitoxin on a compatible plasmid. CONCLUSION: We conclude that vapDHi and vapXHi may constitute a H. influenzae TA locus that functions to enhance NTHi survival within human epithelial and endothelial cells.
TI  - The value of a CT-guided fine needle aspirate in infants with lung abscess.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the range of pathogens isolated from a lung abscess in infants less than one year of age. To assess the role of direct culture from the abscess. METHODS: The two index cases were managed in 2002. An institution-based review was conducted of all infants up to one year of age diagnosed with a lung abscess between 1989 and 2002. Data sources were hospital's disease index and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Audit database using ICD9 and ICD10 diagnostic codes for 'lung abscess'. RESULTS: Five infants, under the age of one year, were treated for a lung abscess. In the one case where the abscess was left-sided it was associated with a congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lung. Pathogens were isolated following direct culture of the abscess in four cases. In three cases a single pathogen was isolated: pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae. In one case a mixture of escherichia coli, streptococcus milleri and an anaerobe, propionibacteria, were cultured. Antibiotic therapy was directed at the identified pathogen(s) in all four cases. There was no mortality or recurrence. CONCLUSION: Predisposing factors for a lung abscess in infancy include prematurity, assisted ventilation, congenital lung anomaly and aspiration. Given the range of potential pathogens, direct culture by CT-guided fine needle aspiration is recommended to direct appropriate intravenous medical therapy provided the abscess is located peripherally.
TI  - Mu-like prophage strong gyrase site sequences: analysis of properties required for promoting efficient mu DNA replication.
AB  - The bacteriophage Mu genome contains a centrally located strong gyrase site (SGS) that is required for efficient prophage replication. To aid in studying the unusual properties of the SGS, we sought other gyrase sites that might be able to substitute for the SGS in Mu replication. Five candidate sites were obtained by PCR from Mu-like prophage sequences present in Escherichia coli O157:H7 Sakai, Haemophilus influenzae Rd, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi CT18, and two strains of Neisseria meningitidis. Each of the sites was used to replace the natural Mu SGS to form recombinant prophages, and the effects on Mu replication and host lysis were determined. The site from the E. coli prophage supported markedly enhanced replication and host lysis over that observed with a Mu derivative lacking the SGS, those from the N. meningitidis prophages allowed a small enhancement, and the sites from the Haemophilus and Salmonella prophages gave none. Each of the candidate sites was cleaved specifically by E. coli DNA gyrase both in vitro and in vivo. Supercoiling assays performed in vitro, with the five sites or the Mu SGS individually cloned into a pUC19 reporter plasmid, showed that the Mu SGS and the E. coli or N. meningitidis sequences allowed an enhancement of processive, gyrase-dependent supercoiling, whereas the H. influenzae or Salmonella serovar Typhi sequences did not. While consistent with a requirement for enhanced processivity of supercoiling for a site to function in Mu replication, these data suggest that other factors are also important. The relevance of these observations to an understanding of the function of the SGS is discussed.
TI  - PK-PD modelling of the effect of cefaclor on four different bacterial strains.
AB  - The effect of cefaclor against relevant bacterial strains was studied by employing a combined in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK)-in vitro pharmacodynamic (PD) approach. For this purpose selected isolates of Escherichia coli, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were exposed in vitro to the interstitial cefaclor profile obtained in vivo in the interstitial space fluid of human tissue after administration of commonly used doses of cefaclor and the change in the number of colony forming units per millilitre (CFU/ml) versus time was monitored. Fitting of the data using a modified E(max)-model resulted in a set of mean pharmacodynamic parameters (k0, k(max), EC50) for each bacterial strain. The parameters derived from these experiments were used in a computer-simulation of the antibacterial effects for different dosing regimens and formulations of cefaclor, notably an immediate (IR) and a modified (MR) release formulation. Dosage regimens were compared using the ratio between the number of bacteria remaining after 24 h of a given treatment (N24h). The results indicate that the number of bacteria of all investigated strains killed per day is equivalent when the same daily dose is administered twice a day with the MR dosage form than when given three times a day with the IR dosage form, in spite of the fact that the MR dosage form has approximately 20% lower bioavailability. Best results were obtained with the three-times a day regimen of the MR formulation. In conclusion, the present in vivo-PK/in vitro-PD simulations of the antimicrobial effects of cefaclor indicate that a twice-daily treatment with a MR formulation may offer a convenient and safe alternative to the conventional tid treatment.
TI  - Rates of antimicrobial resistance among common bacterial pathogens causing respiratory, blood, urine, and skin and soft tissue infections in pediatric patients.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance patterns among the principal bacterial pathogens from infections of the respiratory tract, blood, skin and soft tissue, and urinary tract of pediatric patients from the USA, Canada, Germany, France, and Italy were studied using the The Surveillance Network (TSN) database. Among Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from respiratory tract infections, the prevalence of high-level penicillin resistance (MIC>/=2 microg/ml) ranged from 1.1 (Italy) to 36.2% (USA); erythromycin resistance was higher, ranging from 13.4 (Germany) to 63.8% (France). The prevalence of beta-lactamase-positive Haemophilus influenzae among isolates from lower respiratory tract infections ranged from <10 (Italy and Germany) to 38.4% (USA). Among isolates from blood and skin and soft tissue infections, the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ranged from 7.2% (Canada and Germany) to 27.3% (Italy). The prevalence of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae with putative extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among isolates from blood, urinary tract, and skin and soft tissue infections ranged from 0 (Germany and France) to 29.6% (Italy). With the exception of pseudomonal infections or infections with MRSA, amoxicillin-clavulanate retained moderate activity, whilst ceftriaxone and cefepime were the most effective broad-spectrum injectable agents. Meropenem was the most effective agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with <5% resistance. Low levels of resistance, along with acceptable safety profiles and the availability of convenient oral formulations, continue to support the use of ceftriaxone, cefepime, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and meropenem as viable options for the treatment of infections in pediatric patients.
TI  - Gemifloxacin: a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - Gemifloxacin is a dual targeted fluoroquinolone with potent in vitro activity against Gram-positive, -negative and atypical human pathogens--pathogens considered to be important causes of community-acquired respiratory tract infections. Gemifloxacin demonstrates impressive minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC 90 ) values against clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Legionella spp., with MIC 90 values reported to be 0.016-0.06, < 0.0008-0.06, 0.008-0.3, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.016-0.07 microg/ml, respectively. Gemifloxacin is also active in vitro against a broad range of Gram-negative bacilli with MIC 90 values against the Enterobacteriaceae in the range of 0.016 to > 16 microg/ml ( Escherichia coli and Providencia stuartii, respectively), with the majority of the genus having MIC 90 drug concentrations < 0.5 microg/ml. The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against anaerobic organisms is variable. The MIC values for gemifloxacin are not affected by beta-lactamase production nor by penicillin or macrolide resistance in S. pneumoniae. Gemifloxacin is approved by the FDA to be clinically efficacious against multi-drug resistant S. pneumoniae. The pharmacokinetics of gemifloxacin are such that the drug can be administered orally once-daily to yield or achieve sustainable drug concentrations exceeding the MIC values of clinically important organisms. Gemifloxacin has been shown to target both DNA gyrase (preferred target) and topoisomerase IV (secondary target) - enzymes critical for DNA replication and organism survival - against clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae. This dual targeting activity is thought to be important for reducing the likelihood for selecting for quinolone resistance. Gemifloxacin has been investigated and approved for therapy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. In one study, more patients receiving gemifloxacin compared to clarithromycin remained free of exacerbations for longer periods of time (p < 0.016) and gemifloxacin had a shorter time to eradication of H. influenzae than did clarithromycin (p < 0.02). From efficacy studies, gemifloxacin was found to have an adverse profile that was comparable with other compounds. The most frequent side effects were diarrhoea, abdominal pain and headache. Gemifloxacin is a welcomed addition to currently available agents for the treatment of community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections. Other potential indications appear to be within the spectrum of this compound.
TI  - Mutations in Haemophilus influenzae mismatch repair genes increase mutation rates of dinucleotide repeat tracts but not dinucleotide repeat-driven pilin phase variation rates.
AB  - High-frequency, reversible switches in expression of surface antigens, referred to as phase variation (PV), are characteristic of Haemophilus influenzae. PV enables this bacterial species, an obligate commensal and pathogen of the human upper respiratory tract, to adapt to changes in the host environment. Phase-variable hemagglutinating pili are expressed by many H. influenzae isolates. PV involves alterations in the number of 5' TA repeats located between the -10 and -35 promoter elements of the overlapping, divergently orientated promoters of hifA and hifBCDE, whose products mediate biosynthesis and assembly of pili. Dinucleotide repeat tracts are destabilized by mismatch repair (MMR) mutations in Escherichia coli. The influence of mutations in MMR genes of H. influenzae strain Rd on dinucleotide repeat-mediated PV rates was investigated by using reporter constructs containing 20 5' AT repeats. Mutations in mutS, mutL, and mutH elevated rates approximately 30-fold, while rates in dam and uvrD mutants were increased 14- and 3-fold, respectively. PV rates of constructs containing 10 to 12 5' AT repeats were significantly elevated in mutS mutants of H. influenzae strains Rd and Eagan. An intact hif locus was found in 14 and 12% of representative nontypeable H. influenzae isolates associated with either otitis media or carriage, respectively. Nine or more tandem 5' TA repeats were present in the promoter region. Surprisingly, inactivation of mutS in two serotype b H. influenzae strains did not alter pilin PV rates. Thus, although functionally analogous to the E. coli MMR pathway and active on dinucleotide repeat tracts, defects in H. influenzae MMR do not affect 5' TA-mediated pilin PV.
TI  - [Nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2002].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of meropenem (MEPM) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 899 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, 1500 strains of Gram-negative bacteria, and 158 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 28 medical institutions during 2002 was measured. The results were as follows; 1. MEPM was more active than other carbapenem antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae. MIC90 of MEPM against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the lowest of the drugs tested. MEPM showed low cross-resistant rate against both imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa and ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa. MEPM was active against most of the species tested in Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). 2. The proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) strains was 3.1% (4 strains) in Escherichia coli and 1.9% (2 strains) in Klebsiella pneumoniae. Carbapenems including MEPM were active against these ESBL strains. In conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that MEPM retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem; at present, 7 years after available for commercial use.
TI  - In Silico Metabolic Model and Protein Expression of Haemophilus influenzae Strain Rd KW20 in Rich Medium.
AB  - The intermediary metabolism of Haemophilus influenzae strain Rd KW20 was studied  by a combination of protein expression analysis using a recently developed direct proteomics approach, mutational analysis, and mathematical modeling. Special emphasis was placed on carbon utilization, sugar fermentation, TCA cycle, and electron transport of H. influenzae cells grown microaerobically and anaerobically in a rich medium. The data indicate that several H. influenzae metabolic proteins similar to Escherichia coli proteins, known to be regulated by low concentrations of oxygen, were well expressed in both growth conditions in H. influenzae. An in silico model of the H. influenzae metabolic network was used to study the effects of selective deletion of certain enzymatic steps. This allowed us to define proteins predicted to be essential or non-essential for cell growth and to address numerous unresolved questions about intermediary metabolism of H. influenzae. Comparison of data from in vivo protein expression with the protein list associated with a genome-scale metabolic model showed significant coverage of the known metabolic proteome. This study demonstrates the significance of an integrated approach to the characterization of H. influenzae metabolism.
TI  - Increased S100B in cerebrospinal fluid of infants with bacterial meningitis: relationship to brain damage and routine cerebrospinal fluid findings.
AB  
TI  - Different meningitis-causing bacteria induce distinct inflammatory responses on interaction with cells of the human meninges.
AB  - The interactions of bacterial pathogens with cells of the human leptomeninges are critical events in the progression of meningitis. An in vitro model based on the culture of human meningioma cells was used to investigate the interactions of the meningeal pathogens Escherichia coli K1, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. A rank order of association with meningioma cells was observed, with N. meningitidis showing the highest levels of adherence, followed by E. coli, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. Neisseria meningitidis and H. influenzae did not invade meningioma cells or induce cell death, but induced a concentration-dependent secretion of inflammatory mediators. Neisseria meningitidis induced higher levels of IL-6, MCP-1, RANTES and GM-CSF than H. influenzae, but there was no significant difference in the levels of IL-8 induced by both pathogens. Streptococcus pneumoniae was also unable to invade meningioma cells, but low concentrations of bacteria failed to stimulate cytokine secretion. However, higher concentrations of pneumococci led to cell death. By contrast, only E. coli K1 invaded meningioma cells directly and induced rapid cell death before an inflammatory response could be induced. These data demonstrate that the interactions of different bacterial pathogens with human meningeal cells are distinct, and suggest that different intervention strategies may be needed in order to prevent the morbidity and mortality associated with bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Operon prediction by comparative genomics: an application to the Synechococcus sp. WH8102 genome.
AB  - We present a computational method for operon prediction based on a comparative genomics approach. A group of consecutive genes is considered as a candidate operon if both their gene sequences and functions are conserved across several phylogenetically related genomes. In addition, various supporting data for operons are also collected through the application of public domain computer programs, and used in our prediction method. These include the prediction of conserved gene functions, promoter motifs and terminators. An apparent advantage of our approach over other operon prediction methods is that it does not require many experimental data (such as gene expression data and pathway data) as input. This feature makes it applicable to many newly sequenced genomes that do not have extensive experimental information. In order to validate our prediction, we have tested the method on Escherichia coli K12, in which operon structures have been extensively studied, through a comparative analysis against Haemophilus influenzae Rd and Salmonella typhimurium LT2. Our method successfully predicted most of the 237 known operons. After this initial validation, we then applied the method to a newly sequenced and annotated microbial genome, Synechococcus sp. WH8102, through a comparative genome analysis with two other cyanobacterial genomes, Prochlorococcus marinus sp. MED4 and P.marinus sp. MIT9313. Our results are consistent with previously reported results and statistics on operons in the literature.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of three new quinolones and azithromycin against  aerobic pathogens causing respiratory tract and abdominal wound infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In our study the in vitro susceptibility of common pathogens that cause respiratory tract and abdominal wound infections was tested against two newer fluorquinolones (moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin) as well as levofloxacin and azithromycin. METHODS: 50 isolates each of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae isolated from the respiratory tract and from wounds were tested for their susceptibility to moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and azithromycin. RESULTS: Moxifloxacin proved to be the most active substance against the tested gram-positive pathogens. Gatifloxacin was the most active against P. aeruginosa. Moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin proved to be comparably active against the clinical isolates of E. coli and H. influenzae. CONCLUSIONS: Moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin display excellent activity against respiratory pathogens as well as nosocomial pathogens causing abdominal wound infections. When treating infections caused by P. aeruginosa the earlier fluorquinolones such as ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin are the substances of choice.
TI  - Effect of moxifloxacin on bacterial pathogenicity factors in comparison with amoxicillin, clarithromycin and ceftriaxone.
AB  - Moxifloxacin is a recent fluoroquinolone with an antibacterial spectrum encompassing both aerobic Gram-negative and Gram-positive strains, as well as anaerobic bacteria. In this study the activity of moxifloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and effects of subinhibitory concentrations on bacterial morphology and adhesion properties were compared with those of amoxicillin, clarithromycin and ceftriaxone. The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens was equal to or better than that of comparators. Subinhibitory concentrations of moxifloxacin significantly affected bacterial morphology of S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis, H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa, leading to formation of spherical forms and filaments. Moreover, bacterial adhesion to buccal cells and fibroblasts was reduced after treatment with 1/4 and 1/8 X MIC of moxifloxacin. In conclusion, subinhibitory concentrations of moxifloxacin remarkably interfere with some bacterial pathogenic factors, thereby contributing to its antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Comparative study of the in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, ABT-492.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, ABT-492, was determined. METHODS: MICs were compared with those of two beta-lactams, telithromycin, ciprofloxacin and four later generation fluoroquinolones. The effects of human serum and of inoculum concentration were also investigated. RESULTS: MIC data indicate that ABT-492 has potent activity against Gram-positive organisms with enhanced anti-staphylococcal activity compared with earlier fluoroquinolones, in addition to activity against beta-haemolytic streptococci, pneumococci including penicillin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant Enterococcus faecalis but not Enterococcus faecium. ABT-492 was the most active agent tested against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria meningitidis, fluoroquinolone-susceptible Neisseria gonorrhoeae and anaerobes. Good activity was observed for ABT-492 amongst the Enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes tested, but ciprofloxacin showed superior activity for species of Proteus, Morganella and Providencia, as well as for Pseudomonas spp. In common with the other fluoroquinolones tested, organisms with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin had raised MIC(90)s to ABT-492. The one isolate of H. influenzae tested with reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility had an ABT-492 MIC close to that of the population lacking a mechanism of quinolone resistance. ABT-492 was more active than ciprofloxacin against Chlamydia spp. An inoculum effect was observed with a number of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, E. faecium, Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli, in addition to moderately raised MICs in the presence of 70% serum protein. The clinical significance of these findings is yet to be determined. CONCLUSIONS: ABT-492 is a new fluoroquinolone with excellent activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, with many potential clinical uses.
TI  - [Observational study investigating the use of levofloxacin in ICU patients].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is little information on the use of levofloxacin, a new quinolone, in ICU patients. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the criteria for the use of levofloxacin (indications, forms of prescription, doses, and routes of administration) and to study tolerance in patients admitted to the ICU. Method. Prospective, observational study performed from October 2000 to November 2001 in 35 ICUs and including the first 15 patients receiving levofloxacin as monotherapy or combined treatment. Descriptive data are expressed as mean and percentage. Statistical significance was set at P < .05. RESULTS: A total of 543 indications for treatment with levofloxacin were analyzed. The patients were 70.7% men, with a mean (SD) age of 60.2 (16.7) years, mean APACHE II score of 18.9 (7.9), and a medical underlying disease in 79.2% of cases. The ICU mortality rate was 24.1%. A total of 60% of patients required mechanical ventilation and 44.3% needed inotropic drug treatment. Levofloxacin was predominantly prescribed for treating community-acquired infections (67.8%), mainly in the respiratory tract (88.1%). An etiological diagnosis was established in only 55.6% of cases. The most common pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (12.7%), Haemophilus influenzae (9.1%), Escherichia coli (7.4%), methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (7.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.9%), and Legionella pneumophila (4.7%). In 87.1% of indications, levofloxacin was prescribed as empirical treatment. Susceptibility of the isolated pathogens to this antibiotic was confirmed in 32.2% of cases. The initial dose was 500 mg/24 h in 48.5% of indications and 500 mg/12 h in 48.3%. Combined treatment was given in 49.7% of cases. In 32.2% of cases, parenteral administration of levofloxacin was changed to oral route. Adverse events probably or possibly associated with levofloxacin occurred in only 12.5% of patients and mainly included increased ALT/ALS levels (4.4%), diarrhea (2.3%), and heart rhythm alterations (2.1%). CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the profile of critically ill patients receiving levofloxacin and the different forms of its use in the ICU.
TI  - Identification of the Haemophilus influenzae tolC gene by susceptibility profiles of insertionally inactivated efflux pump mutants.
AB  - Isogenic strains containing insertional disruptions of 10 Haemophilus influenzae  Rd genes were investigated for their effects on the susceptibility of the organism to various classes of antimicrobial compounds. MIC results show that HI1462, which encodes an Escherichia coli TolC homolog, is the third component of the H. influenzae AcrAB pump.
TI  - A global approach to identify novel broad-spectrum antibacterial targets among proteins of unknown function.
AB  - Attempted allelic replacement of 144 Streptococcus pneumoniae open reading frames of previously uncharacterized function led to the identification of 36 genes essential for growth under laboratory conditions. Of these, 14 genes (obg, spoIIIJ2, trmU, yacA, yacM, ydiC, ydiE, yjbN, yneS, yphC, ysxC, ytaG, yloI and yxeH4) were also essential in Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae or Escherichia coli, 2 genes (yrrK and ydiB) were only essential in H. influenzae as well as S. pneumoniae and 8 genes were necessary for growth of S.pneumoniae and S. aureus and did not have a homolog in H. influenzae(murD2, ykqC, ylqF, yqeH, ytgP, yybQ) or were not essential in that organism (yqeL, yhcT). The proteins encoded by these genes could represent good targets for novel antibiotics covering different therapeutic profiles. The putative functions of some of these essential proteins, inferred by bioinformatic analysis, are presented. Four mutants, with deletions of loci not essential for in vitro growth, were found to be severely attenuated in a murine respiratory tract infection model, suggesting that not all targets for antibacterial therapeutics are revealed by simple in vitro essentiality testing. The results of our experiments together with those collated from previously reported studies including Bacillus subtilis, E. coli and Mycoplasma sp. demonstrate that gene conservation amongst bacteria does not necessarily indicate that essentiality in one organism can be extrapolated to others. Moreover, this study demonstrates that different experimental procedures can produce apparently contradictory results.
TI  - Kinetics of protein substrate degradation by HslUV.
AB  - The HslUV protease-chaperone complex degrades specific protein substrates in an ATP-dependent reaction. Current models propose that the HslU chaperone, a AAA protein of the Clp/Hsp100 family, binds and unfolds substrates and translocates the polypeptide into the catalytic cavity of the HslV protease. These processes are being characterized using substrates that are targeted to HslUV with a carboxy-terminal fusion of the natural substrate SulA or the carboxy-terminal 11 amino acid residues thereof. In a tandem fusion of green fluorescent protein with SulA, HslUV degrades the SulA moiety but not green fluorescent protein. Wild type and mutant Arc repressor variants are degraded; over a range of substrate stabilities, the specific rate of degradation and its dependence on substrate stability is similar to that of ClpXP. For a hyperstable Arc variant having an intermolecular disulfide bond, the rate of degradation by HslUV is an order of magnitude slower than by ClpXP. Similarity in degradation rates for a subset of substrates by HslUV and ClpXP suggests a similarity in mechanism of the apparent rate-limiting steps of unfolding and translocation by the chaperone components HslU and ClpX. The fall-off in degradation by HslUV for the more stable substrates that are degraded by ClpXP is consistent with the two systems acting on different spectra of biological substrates.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in infants: the epidemiology, clinical features, and prognostic factors.
AB  - This 16-year (1986-2001) retrospective study enrolled 80 infantile patients (aged, 30-365 days old) with culture-proven bacterial meningitis. The most prevalent pathogens were Salmonellaspecies, Streptococcus (S.) agalactiae, Escherichia (E.) coli, and Haemophilus (H.) influenzae, accounting for about 59% of the episodes. Meningitis caused by Salmonella species, E. coli and H. influenzae occurs more often in the older infants, while that caused by S. agalactiae occurs more often in young infants. Our study revealed a decrease in the proportion of Salmonella meningitis from 27% in the first 8 years to 9% in the second 8 years with E. coli replacing Salmonella species as the leading pathogen of this disease during the second period. Overall mortality rate for both periods of time was 11%. However, if we take those with undesirable poor outcomes into account, 43% of patients could be considered treatment failures. The study also reveals a high prevalence of neurological complications when this disease is caused by H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and Salmonella species. Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that only initial changing levels of consciousness (P = 0.006) were independently associated with treatment failure. The most frequent neurological complications associated with this disease included subdural empyema, hydrocephalus, cerebral infarctions, and seizures. Because therapeutic regimens may require attention to the eradication of bacterial pathogen but also the neurological complications, early diagnosis and choice of appropriate antibiotics are essential to increasing the possibility of survival.
TI  - Haemophilus influenzae as a possible cause of Guillain-Barre syndrome.
AB  - Recent reports have contained conflicting results on the relationship between antecedent Haemophilus influenzae infection and Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). To investigate the prevalence of H. influenzae infection in GBS patients in a British population, we carried out a retrospective study with 62 consecutive GBS patients and 63 normal controls of similar age and sex. Whole bacteria of both encapsulated and nonencapsulated strains of H. influenzae were employed as antigens in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for anti-H. influenzae IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies. Elevated antibodies of two or three classes were found in one GBS patient and none in the normal controls. Six GBS patients had IgG antibodies against nonencapsulated H. influenzae compared with only one in the normal control group (p=0.06). Western blot for IgG antibody showed that all the sera with IgG antibodies recognized the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of both strains of H. influenzae. Antiganglioside GM1 antibody was not associated with anti-H. influenzae antibody in our study. Absorption with encapsulated or nonencapsulated H. influenzae, Campylobacter jejuni and Escherichia coli before testing on Western blot showed that only nonencapsulated H. influenzae absorbed the anti-LPS antibodies. In conclusion, there is a possible but rare association of GBS with nonencapsulated H. influenzae in the UK.

TI  - [Antibacterial activity of oral Cephems against various clinically isolated strains].
AB  - We determined the antibacterial activities of oral Cephems against isolated from  the patients with the respiratory infections, the urinary tract infections, and infections in the obstetrics field of an adult and a child, during the period from 2002 to 2003; Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli of 40 strains of each, and Peptostreptococcus spp. 22 strains. S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae strains that resistant is regarded were collected mainly, penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) and beta-lactamase negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae (BLNAR) strains. The MICs of Cephems except cefaclor (CCL) were < or = 0.03 microgram/mL against all strains of S. pyogenes. The MICs of cefteram (CFTM) and cefditoren (CDTR) were < or = 0.0125 microgram/mL activity against 7 strains penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP). However the MIC90s of cefditoren (CDTR) was 1 microgram/mL, cefteram (CFTM), and cefcapene (CFPN) were 2 micrograms/mL against PISP and PRSP, were higher than those of other drugs, but showed slightly higher than PSSP. The MIC90s of Cephems. were 0.5-4 micrograms/mL against strains of E. coli. The MIC90s of CFTM was 0.5 microgram/mL, and CDTR, CFPN were 1 microgram/mL against E. coli were higher than those of other drugs. The four strains of E. coli however were highly-resistant which MIC90s of CCL were more than 32 micrograms/mL were obtains. Furthermore it is necessary to pay much attention to the trend of resistant such as E. coli of Cephems. Although all strains showed resistant to AMPC, MIC90 of Cephems were 0.25-1 microgram/mL, good activities against K. pneumoniae. Against beta-lactamase negative ampicillin-susceptible H. influenzae (BLNAS) 23 strains the MIC90s of CCL and other Cephems were 64 micrograms/mL and 0.25-8 micrograms/mL. The MIC90s of CDTR and CFTM were < or = 1 microgram/mL of BLNAR (15 strains). However there of CFDN and CPDX were 8 micrograms/mL and CCL were > or = 16 micrograms/mL. Two strains which were produced beta-lactamase were highly--ABPC resistant. Although B. catarrhalis all strains were produced beta-lactamase and Cephems except for CCL showed better susceptibility than AMPC. The MIC90s of Cephems were 0.25-2 micrograms/mL against Peptostreptococcus spp.
TI  - Diversity of microbial sialic acid metabolism.
AB  - Sialic acids are structurally unique nine-carbon keto sugars occupying the interface between the host and commensal or pathogenic microorganisms. An important function of host sialic acid is to regulate innate immunity, and microbes have evolved various strategies for subverting this process by decorating their surfaces with sialylated oligosaccharides that mimic those of the host. These subversive strategies include a de novo synthetic pathway and at least two truncated pathways that depend on scavenging host-derived intermediates. A fourth strategy involves modification of sialidases so that instead of transferring sialic acid to water (hydrolysis), a second active site is created for binding alternative acceptors. Sialic acids also are excellent sources of carbon, nitrogen, energy, and precursors of cell wall biosynthesis. The catabolic strategies for exploiting host sialic acids as nutritional sources are as diverse as the biosynthetic mechanisms, including examples of horizontal gene transfer and multiple transport systems. Finally, as compounds coating the surfaces of virtually every vertebrate cell, sialic acids provide information about the host environment that, at least in Escherichia coli, is interpreted by the global regulator encoded by nanR. In addition to regulating the catabolism of sialic acids through the nan operon, NanR controls at least two other operons of unknown function and appears to participate in the regulation of type 1 fimbrial phase variation. Sialic acid is, therefore, a host molecule to be copied (molecular mimicry), eaten (nutrition), and interpreted (cell signaling) by diverse metabolic machinery in all major groups of mammalian pathogens and commensals.
TI  - The role of the polymerase chain reaction in the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis in Vietnam.
AB  - Bacterial meningitis remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in Vietnam. Diagnosis is hampered by the ready availability of antibiotics in the community, leading to late presentation, masked clinical signs, and poor organism detection during the microscopical examination and culture of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In order to improve organism detection at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City, a diagnostic PCR-based protocol was developed. This protocol was followed in the investigation of CSF samples from 36 patients with clinical signs of bacterial meningitis. Each sample was first tested in a semi-nested PCR using primers for the 16sRNA gene common to all bacteria. The products of this reaction were then amplified using a 16sru8 primer and primers specific for Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae or Streptococcus spp. The samples found positive for Streptococcus were further investigated in a nested PCR using primers specific for the pneumolysin gene of S. pneumoniae. The sensitivity of detection was increased from 36% with culture to 44% with PCR. Although the sample size was small, the results indicate that PCR would be a feasible and useful adjunct in the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis, particularly in areas where community antibiotic use is common.
TI  - Bacteriology of mastoid subperiosteal abscess in children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Subperiosteal abscess (SA) is the most frequent complication of acute  mastoiditis (AM). Of pathogens cultured from the external auditory canal or middle ear during myringotomy, 15% may be different from microorganisms isolated from the SA. We suggest, therefore, that only cultures obtained from the abscess cavity can truly reflect the bacteriology of this complication of AM. The purpose of our study was to analyze the infectious agents which cause SA and mastoid cortex erosion in children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The medical records of 35 children who underwent mastoidectomy for SA between May 1984 and April 2002 were evaluated. RESULTS: Mastoid cortex erosion was found at surgery in 72.7% of abscesses Purulent discharge was obtained from the SA cavity in 28 cases. The commonest pathogens isolated in these cases, as well as in 18 cases of mastoid cortex erosion, were Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Hemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Sterile culture was found in 25% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Mastoid SA is a unilateral disease that can recur. Early administration of anti-Staphylococcus medications should be considered for patients with SA as a complication of AM.
TI  - Bivalent tethering of SspB to ClpXP is required for efficient substrate delivery: a protein-design study.
AB  - SspB homodimers deliver ssrA-tagged substrates to ClpXP for degradation. SspB consists of a substrate binding domain and an unstructured tail with a ClpX binding module (XB). Using computational design, we engineered an SspB heterodimer whose subunits did not form homodimers. Experiments with the designed molecule and variants lacking one or two tails demonstrate that both XB modules are required for strong binding and efficient substrate delivery to ClpXP. Assembly of stable SspB-substrate-ClpX delivery complexes requires the coupling of weak tethering interactions between ClpX and the SspB XB modules as well as interactions between ClpX and the substrate degradation tag. The ClpX hexamer contains three XB binding sites, one per N domain dimer, and thus binds strongly to just one SspB dimer at a time. Because different adaptor proteins use the same tethering sites in ClpX, those which employ bivalent tethering, like SspB, will compete more effectively for substrate delivery to ClpXP.
TI  - Increasing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Korea: KONSAR study in 2001.
AB  - The 5th year KONSAR surveillance in 2001 was based on routine test data at 30 participating hospitals. It was of particular interest to find a trend in the resistances of enterococci to vancomycin, of Enterobacteriaceae to the 3rd generation cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone, and of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacters to carbapenem. Resistance rates of Gram-positive cocci were: 70% of Staphylococcus aureus to oxacillin; 88% and 16% of Enterococcus faecium to ampicillin and vancomycin, respectively. Seventy-two percent of pneumococci were nonsusceptible to penicillin. The resistance rates of Enterobacteriaceae were: Escherichia coli, 28% to fluoroquinolone; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 27% to ceftazidime, and 20% to cefoxitin; and Enterobacter cloacae, > or =40% to cefotaxime and ceftazidime. The resistance rates of P. aeruginosa were 21% to ceftazidime, 17% to imipenem, and those of the acinetobacters were > or =61% to ceftazidime, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolone and cotrimoxazole. Thirty-five percent of non-typhoidal salmonellae were ampicillin resistant, and 66% of Haemophilus influenzae were beta-lactamase producers. Notable changes over the 1997-2001 period were: increases in vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, and amikacin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant acinetobacters. With the increasing prevalence of resistant bacteria, nationwide surveillance has become more important for optimal patient management, for the control of nosocomial infection, and for the conservation of the newer antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Immunologic analysis of a phase I/II study of vaccination with MAGE-3 protein combined with the AS02B adjuvant in patients with MAGE-3-positive tumors.
AB  - In a phase I/II study, patients with solid metastatic MAGE-3-positive tumors, mainly melanoma, were vaccinated with recombinant MAGE-3 protein combined with the immunologic adjuvant AS02B comprised of MPL and QS21 in an oil-in-water emulsion. The recombinant MAGE-3 protein was made up of a partial sequence of the protein D (ProtD) antigen of Haemophilus influenzae fused to the MAGE-3 sequence. The vaccine was given intramuscularly at 3-week intervals. Patients whose tumors stabilized or regressed after 4 vaccinations received 2 additional vaccinations at 6-week intervals. MAGE-3 and ProtD antibody and cellular immune responses were monitored after vaccination. Ninety-six percent (23/24) of the patients vaccinated with MAGE-3 protein in AS02B adjuvant elicited a significant anti-MAGE-3 IgG antibody response after 4 vaccinations, and all developed anti-ProtD IgG antibodies. For the detection of T-cell activity, total peripheral blood mononuclear cells were restimulated in vitro with MAGE-3- or ProtD-loaded autologous mature dendritic cells. In 30% of the evaluable patients vaccinated with the adjuvanted recombinant protein, IFNgamma production was increased in response to MAGE-3, and 2 patients (14% of evaluable patients) had a concomitant increase in IL-5 production. In 37% and 43% of the patients, respectively, IFNgamma or IL-5 production was increased in response to ProtD. It is concluded that vaccination of advanced cancer patients with MAGE-3 self-antigen in AS02B adjuvant is able to elicit MAGE-3-specific antibody and a T-cell response.
TI  - Epidemiology of nosocomial pneumonia in infants after cardiac surgery.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pattern of nosocomial pneumonia (NP) in infants in a pediatric surgical ICU after cardiac surgery may differ from that seen in adult ICUs. STUDY OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of NP in infants after cardiac surgery and, secondarily, to describe the changes of the distribution and antibiotic resistance of the pathogen during the last 3 years. METHODS: Data were collected between June 1999 and June 2002 from 311 consecutive infants who underwent open-heart surgery in our hospital. We retrospectively analyzed the distribution and antibiotic resistance pattern of all the pathogenic microbial isolates cultured from lower respiratory tract aspirations. RESULTS: Of 311 infants, 67 patients (21.5%) acquired NP after cardiac surgery. The incidence of NP was more frequently associated with complex congenital heart defect (CHD) compared to simple CHD (43% vs 15.9%, chi(2) = 22.47, p < 0.0001). The proportion of late-onset NP was higher in patients with complex CHD (chi(2) = 6.02, p = 0.014). A total of 79 pathogenic microbial strains were isolated. Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) were the most frequent isolates (68 isolates, 86.1%), followed by fungi (6 isolates, 7.6%) and Gram-positive cocci (5 isolates, 6.3%). The main GNB were Acinetobacter baumanii (11 isolates, 13.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 isolates, 12.7%); other commonly seen GNB were Flavobacterium meningosepticum (7 isolates, 8.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7 isolates, 8.9%), Escherichia coli (6 isolates, 7.6%), and Xanthomonas maltophilia (5 isolates, 6.2%). The most commonly seen Gram-positive cocci were Staphylococcus aureus (2 isolates, 2.5%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 isolates, 2.5%). The frequent fungi were Candida albicans (5 isolates, 6.3%). Most GNB were sensitive to cefoperazone-sulbactum, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, amikacin. The bacteria producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases were mainly from K pneumoniae and E coli; the susceptibility of ESBL-producing strains to imipenem was 100%. There were one case of methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) and 1 case of methicillin-resistant S epidermidis; their susceptibility to vancomycin, gentamycin, and ciprofloxacin were 100%. From 1999 to 2002 in infants with NP after open-heart surgery, there was a trend of increasing frequency of multiresistant GNB such as A baumanii, P aeruginosa, and K pneumoniae. However, no remarkable changes of distribution were found in Gram-positive cocci and fungi in the 3-year period. Early onset episodes of NP were frequently caused by Haemophilus influenzae, methicillin-sensitive S aureus, and other susceptible Enterobacteriaceae. Conversely, in patients who acquired late-onset NP, P aeruginosa, A baumannii, other multiresistant GNB, MRSA, and fungi were the predominant organisms. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of pathogens and their antibiotic-resistance patterns in NP in infants after cardiac surgery had not shown an increasing prevalence of Gram-positive pathogens as reported by several adult ICUs. GNB still remained the most common pathogens during the last 3 years in our hospital. There was a trend of increasing antibiotic resistance in these isolates.
TI  - Solution structure of the highly acidic protein HI1450 from Haemophilus influenzae, a putative double-stranded DNA mimic.
AB  - The solution structure of the acidic protein HI1450 from Haemophilus influenzae has been determined by NMR spectroscopy. HI1450 has homologues in ten other bacterial species including Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, and Yersinia pestis but there are no functional assignments for any members of the family. Thirty-one of the amino acids in this 107-residue protein are aspartates or glutamates, contributing to an unusually low pI of 3.72. The secondary structure elements are arranged in an alpha-alpha-beta-beta-beta-beta order with the two alpha helices packed against the same side of an anti-parallel four-stranded beta meander. Two large loops, one between beta1 and beta2 and the other between beta2 and beta3 bend almost perpendicularly across the beta-strands in opposite directions on the non-helical side of the beta-sheet to form a conserved hydrophobic cavity. The HI1450 structure has some similarities to the structure of the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) mimic uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor (Ugi) including the distribution of surface charges and the position of the hydrophobic cavity. Based on these similarities, as well as having a comparable molecular surface to dsDNA, we propose that HI1450 may function as a dsDNA mimic in order to inhibit or regulate an as yet unidentified dsDNA binding protein.
TI  - New class of bacterial phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitors with high potency  and broad-spectrum activity.
AB  - Phenylalanyl (Phe)-tRNA synthetase (Phe-RS) is an essential enzyme which catalyzes the transfer of phenylalanine to the Phe-specific transfer RNA (tRNA(Phe)), a key step in protein biosynthesis. Phenyl-thiazolylurea-sulfonamides were identified as a novel class of potent inhibitors of bacterial Phe-RS by high-throughput screening and chemical variation of the screening hit. The compounds inhibit Phe-RS of Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus, with 50% inhibitory concentrations in the nanomolar range. Enzyme kinetic measurements demonstrated that the compounds bind competitively with respect to the natural substrate Phe. All derivatives are highly selective for the bacterial Phe-RS versus the corresponding mammalian cytoplasmic and human mitochondrial enzymes. Phenyl-thiazolylurea-sulfonamides displayed good in vitro activity against Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Haemophilus, and Moraxella strains, reaching MICs below 1 micro g/ml. The antibacterial activity was partly antagonized by increasing concentrations of Phe in the culture broth in accordance with the competitive binding mode. Further evidence that inhibition of tRNA(Phe) charging is the antibacterial principle of this compound class was obtained by proteome analysis of Bacillus subtilis. Here, the phenyl-thiazolylurea-sulfonamides induced a protein pattern indicative of the stringent response. In addition, an E. coli strain carrying a relA mutation and defective in stringent response was more susceptible than its isogenic relA(+) parent strain. In vivo efficacy was investigated in a murine S. aureus sepsis model and a S. pneumoniae sepsis model in rats. Treatment with the phenyl-thiazolylurea-sulfonamides reduced the bacterial titer in various organs by up to 3 log units, supporting the potential value of Phe-RS as a target in antibacterial therapy.
TI  - Characterization of two lipoproteins in Pasteurella multocida.
AB  - An in vivo expression technology (IVET) system was previously developed and used  to identify Pasteurella multocida genes, which are upregulated during infection of the host. Of the many genes identified, two encoded products which showed similarity to the Haemophilus influenzae lipoproteins, protein D and PCP, which have been shown to stimulate heterologous immunity against infection with H. influenzae. Therefore, the lipoprotein homologues in P. multocida, designated GlpQ and PCP, were investigated. GlpQ and PCP were shown to be lipoproteins by demonstrating that post-translational processing of the proteins was inhibited by globomycin. The P. multocida GlpQ homologue showed glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase enzyme activity, indicating that it is a functional homologue of other characterized GlpQ enzymes. Using surface immunoprecipitation, PCP was found to be surface exposed, but GlpQ was not. Non-lipidated forms of GlpQ and PCP were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli and used to vaccinate mice. However, mice were not protected from challenge with live P. multocida. The lipoproteins were then expressed in E. coli in the lipidated form and used to vaccinate mice and chickens. Protection against challenge with live P. multocida was not observed.
TI  - Comparing expression level-dependent features in codon usage with protein abundance: an analysis of 'predictive proteomics'.
AB  - Synonymous codon usage is a commonly used means for estimating gene expression levels of Escherichia coli genes and has also been used for predicting highly expressed genes for a number of prokaryotic genomes. By comparison of expression level-dependent features in codon usage with protein abundance data from two proteome studies of exponentially growing E. coli and Bacillus subtilis cells, we try to evaluate whether the implicit assumption of this approach can be confirmed with experimental data. Log-odds ratio scores are used to model differences in codon usage between highly expressed genes and genomic average. Using these, the strength and significance of expression level-dependent features in codon usage were determined for the genes of the Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Haemophilus influenzae genomes. The comparison of codon usage features with protein abundance data confirmed a relationship between these to be present, although exceptions to this, possibly related to functional context, were found. For species with expression level-dependent features in their codon usage, the applied methodology could be used to improve in silico simulations of the outcome of two-dimensional gel electrophoretic experiments.
TI  - The Haemophilus influenzae Hia autotransporter contains an unusually short trimeric translocator domain.
AB  - Gram-negative bacterial autotransporter proteins are a growing group of virulence factors that are characterized by their ability to cross the outer membrane without the help of accessory proteins. A conserved C-terminal beta-domain is critical for targeting of autotransporters to the outer membrane and for translocation of the N-terminal "passenger" domain to the bacterial surface. We have demonstrated previously that the Haemophilus influenzae Hia adhesin belongs to the autotransporter family, with translocator activity residing in the C-terminal 319 residues. To gain further insight into the mechanism of autotransporter protein translocation, we performed a structure-function analysis on Hia. In initial experiments, we generated a series of in-frame deletions and a set of chimeric proteins containing varying regions of the Hia C terminus fused to a heterologous passenger domain and discovered that the final 76 residues of Hia are both necessary and sufficient for translocation. Analysis by flow cytometry revealed that the region N-terminal to this shortened translocator domain is surface localized, further suggesting that this region is not involved in beta-barrel formation or in translocation of the passenger domain. Western analysis demonstrated that the translocation-competent regions of the C terminus migrated at masses consistent with trimers, suggesting that the Hia C terminus oligomerizes. Furthermore, fusion proteins containing a heterologous passenger domain demonstrated that similarly small C-terminal regions of Yersinia sp. YadA and Neisseria meningitidis NhhA are translocation-competent. These data provide experimental support for a unique subclass of autotransporters characterized by a short trimeric translocator domain.
TI  - The role of the methylene blue and toluidine blue monomers and dimers in the photoinactivation of bacteria.
AB  - The interactions between the phenothiazine dyes, methylene blue (MB) and toluidine blue (TB), and bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Hemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were studied spectrophotometrically. This demonstrated that a metachromatic reaction took place between the dyes and bacteria. Furthermore, bacteria induced additional dimerization of MB and TB. The effective dimerization constants of MB and TB were evaluated in the presence of each bacterial strain at a concentration of 10(8) CFU/ml. The analysis of the effective dimerization constants for MB and TB in the presence of bacteria indicated that the ability to form dimers was greater for TB than for MB. Gram-negative bacteria induced the dye dimerization more intensely than gram-positive bacteria. There was a correlation between the ability of each dye to form dimers in the presence of bacteria and the relative photobactericidal efficacy of each dye against these bacteria. These results provide evidence confirming the essential role of the dye dimers in bacterial photodamage.
TI  - Physiological characterization of Haemophilus influenzae Rd deficient in its glutathione-dependent peroxidase PGdx.
AB  - The chimeric peroxidase PGdx of Haemophilus influenzae Rd belongs to a recently identified family of thiol peroxidases capable of reducing hydrogen peroxide as well as alkylhydroperoxides by means of glutathione redox cycling. In the present study, we constructed a H. influenzae Rd strain, deficient in its PGdx encoding gene (open reading frame HI0572). The mutant was shown by disk inhibition and liquid culture growth assays to exhibit increased susceptibility to organic hydroperoxides. The hampered growth was restored by complementing the interrupted gene on the genome with a replicating plasmid bearing an intact copy of the gene, hereby rejecting the possible influences of polar effects. Elevated levels of hydrogen peroxide scavenging activity, due to the catalase HktE, were measured in the absence of a functional pgdx gene rendering the mutant more resilient against hydrogen peroxide. On the other hand, after initiation of the stationary phase, aerobic cultures of the pgdx mutant were practically devoid of living cells, whereas wild-type counterparts retained viability. This observed feature was alleviated by complementation with the functional gene or with the addition of catalase.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of the HmrM multidrug efflux pump from Haemophilus influenzae Rd.
AB  - We cloned a gene responsible for norfloxacin resistance from the chromosomal DNA  of Haemophilus influenzae Rd, and designated the gene as hmrM. HmrM showed sequence similarity with NorM of Vibrio parahaemolyticus and YdhE of Escherichia coli and others that belong to the MATE family multidrug efflux pumps. The recombinant plasmid carrying the hmrM gene conferred elevated resistance not only to norfloxacin but also to acriflavine, 4 ', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, doxorubicin, ethidium bromide, tetraphenylphosphonium chloride, Hoechst 33342, daunomycin, berberine, and sodium deoxycholate in Escherichia coli KAM32, a drug-hypersensitive strain. We observed an Na+-dependent efflux of ethidium and an ethidium-induced efflux of Na+ in E. coli KAM32 cells harboring the plasmid carrying the hmrM gene. These results indicate that HmrM is an Na+/drug antiporter-type multidrug efflux pump. A difference in substrate preference was observed between HmrM, NorM, and YdhE.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. Changes in CZOP susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from the breakpoint MIC. Twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Serratia liquefaciens, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter Iwoffii, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Bacteroides fragilis group, and Prevotella/Porphyromonas. CZOP preserved its antibacterial activity against M. (B.) catarrhalis (MIC90: 4 micrograms/mL) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against H. influenzae (MIC90: 1 microgram/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. coli was preferable (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL) and comparable to those of cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), and imipenem (IPM). The MIC90 of CZOP against K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/mL, respectively. The MIC90 of CZOP against E. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. aerogenes was preferable (MIC90: 1 microgram/mL). The antibacterial activities of CZOP against S. marcescens and S. liquefaciens were relatively potent (MIC90: 0.5 and 0.25 microgram/mL) and comparable to those of CPR, CFPM, and carumonam. CZOP preserved comparable antibacterial activity to CPR against C. freundii and C. koseri (MIC90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/mL). The MIC90 of CZOP against P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, and M. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/mL, respectively. The antibacterial activity of CZOP against Providencia spp. was moderate (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against P. aeruginosa was the most potent (MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) among the test agents and comparable to those CFPM, IPM, and MEPM. CZOP had low activity against P. fluorescens and P. putida (MIC90: 128 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against A. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR and CFPM (MIC90: 32 micrograms/mL) and against A. lwoffii was moderate (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). Most of the test agents including CZOP had low antibacterial activity against B. cepacia, S. maltophilia, and B. fragilis group. The MIC90 of CZOP against Prevotella/Porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/mL. Bacterial cross-resistance ratio between CZOP and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. In non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between CZOP and CFPM, CAZ, CPR, or IPM was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. In conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. cloacae possible decreased, but against other Gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.
TI  - Microbial mimics are major targets of crossreactivity with human pyruvate dehydrogenase in primary biliary cirrhosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Previous studies on patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) have shown extensive cross-reactivity between the dominant B- and T-cell epitopes of human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex-E2 (PDC-E2), and microbial mimics. Such observations have suggested microbial infection as having a role in the induction of anti-mitochondrial antibodies, through a mechanism of molecular mimicry. However the biological significance of these cross-reactivities is questionable, because PDC-E2 is so highly conserved among various species. METHODS: Interrogating protein databases, ten non-PDC-E2 microbial sequences with high degree of similarity to PDC-E2(212-226) were found in Escherichia coli (6), Helicobacter pylori, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Cytomegalovirus, and Haemophilus influenzae. We report on a study testing reactivity and competitive cross-reactivity against these respective peptides, and in some cases the parent protein, using sera from 55 patients with PBC, compared to reactivity of 190 pathological and 28 healthy controls. RESULTS: Cross-reactivity to E. coli mimics was commonly seen in PBC, and in a subset of pathological controls except where there was no evidence of urinary tract infection and correlated with anti-mitochondrial reactivity. CONCLUSIONS: E. coli/PDC-E2 cross-reactive immunity characterizes primary biliary cirrhosis; the large number of E. coli immunogenic mimics may account for the dominance of the major PDC-E2 autoepitope.
TI  - Hierarchy of sequence-dependent features associated with prokaryotic translation.
AB  - Protein expression in the cell is affected by various sequence-dependent features. Several such sequence-dependent features have been individually studied,yet they have not been compared quantitatively in terms of their relative influence on protein expression,and a hierarchy of these elements has not been determined. Here we present a quantitative analysis examining sequence-dependent features involved in prokaryotic translation,namely,the base-pairing potential between the mRNA Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the ribosomal RNA,codon bias,and the identity of the stop codon. We analyzed these features both at intra- and intergenomic levels using the Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae genomes. Within each genome,we examined the relationship between each feature and protein expression levels determined by 2D-gel analyses. At the intergenomic level,comparative genomic principles were applied to study the relative preservation of the different sequence-dependent properties between orthologs. From these analyses,we determined that biased codon usage is the property that is most highly associated with protein expression and that is most conserved. The identity of the stop codon and the base-pairing potential of the mRNA Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the rRNA seem to have less of an effect on protein expression.
TI  - Coverage of protein sequence space by current structural genomics targets.
AB  - By its purest definition the ultimate goal of structural genomics (SG) is the determination of the structures of all proteins encoded by genomes. Most of these will be obtained by homology modeling using the structures of a set of target proteins for experimental determination. Thanks to the open exchange of SG target information, we are able to analyze the sequences of the current target list to evaluate the extent of its coverage of protein sequence space. The presence of homologous sequences currently either in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) or among SG targets has been determined for each of the protein sequences in several organisms. In this way we are able to evaluate the coverage by existing or targeted structural data for the non-membranous parts of entire proteomes. For small bacterial proteomes such as that of H. influenzae almost all proteins have homologous sequences among SG targets or in the PDB. There is significantly lower coverage for more complex organisms, such as C. elegans. We have mapped the SG target list onto the ProtoMap clustering of protein sequences. Clusters occupied by SG targets represent over 150,000 protein sequences, which is approximately 44% of the total protein sequences classified by ProtoMap. The mapping of SG targets also enables an evaluation of the degree of overlap within the target list. An SG target typically occupies a ProtoMap cluster with more than six other homologous targets.
TI  - Novel antibacterial class.
AB  - We report the discovery and characterization of a novel ribosome inhibitor (NRI)  class that exhibits selective and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. Compounds in this class inhibit growth of many gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including the common respiratory pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Moraxella catarrhalis, and are nontoxic to human cell lines. The first NRI was discovered in a high-throughput screen designed to identify inhibitors of cell-free translation in extracts from S. pneumoniae. The chemical structure of the NRI class is related to antibacterial quinolones, but, interestingly, the differences in structure are sufficient to completely alter the biochemical and intracellular mechanisms of action. Expression array studies and analysis of NRI-resistant mutants confirm this difference in intracellular mechanism and provide evidence that the NRIs inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by inhibiting ribosomes. Furthermore, compounds in the NRI series appear to inhibit bacterial ribosomes by a new mechanism, because NRI-resistant strains are not cross-resistant to other ribosome inhibitors, such as macrolides, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, aminoglycosides, or oxazolidinones. The NRIs are a promising new antibacterial class with activity against all major drug-resistant respiratory pathogens.
TI  - Slipped-strand mispairing can function as a phase variation mechanism in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Slipped-strand mispairing (SSM) has not been identified as a mechanism of phase variation in Escherichia coli. Using a reporter gene, we show that sequences that cause phase variation by SSM in Haemophilus influenzae also lead to phase variation when introduced onto the chromosome of E. coli, and the frequencies of switching are in the biologically relevant range. Thus, the absence of SSM-mediated phase variation in E. coli does not appear to be due to a mechanistic constraint.
TI  - Multiple mechanisms for choline transport and utilization in Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae obtains choline from either its growth medium or host cell membrane lipids and expresses it on its lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the form of phosphorylcholine (ChoP), which contributes to its pathogenesis by mimicry of host cell molecules. Two genes (licB and betT) revealed by whole genomic analysis as encoding potential choline transporters were tested for their role in LPS-ChoP synthesis. The betT gene in H. influenzae is similar to betT in Escherichia coli, which functions in choline transport for the generation of betaine in osmoprotection. The licB gene has homology to bacterial permeases including betT and is encoded in the lic1 locus, which is essential for the expression of LPS-ChoP. In the presence of high concentrations of choline, neither licB nor betT were necessary for expression of LPS-ChoP raising the possibility that other unidentified choline uptake mechanisms may exist in this species. However, under choline limiting conditions, including growth in human nasal airway surface fluid, the licB, but not betT, gene was required for choline transport and synthesis of LPS-ChoP suggesting that LicB functions as a high affinity choline permease. The betT, but not licB, gene was shown to function in osmoprotection in H. influenzae, similar to the role of betT in E. coli. Further analysis demonstrated growth condition dependent differences in the regulation of transcription of the licB and betT genes. We conclude that H. influenzae may have multiple mechanisms for choline uptake and distinct pathways for choline utilization in LPS-ChoP biosynthesis and osmoregulation.
TI  - A novel splice variant of human gene GDPD1 is mainly expressed in human ovary and small intestine.
AB  - Glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase (GDPD) is a glycerol metabolizing enzyme  that has been previously identified in Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Bacillus subtilis and Borrelia hermsii. It has been also reported that there is putative protein containing GDPD domain in Mus musculus, but not in Homo sapiens. SMART analysis showed that our predicted protein and three others of the same gene also comprise this domain. Because the gene has not been named, we termed it GDPD1 and accordingly termed our splice variant GDPD1_v1 after acquiring the agreement of HUGO. RT-PCR experiment revealed that our splice variant of the gene is mainly expressed in human ovary and small intestine, basically conforming to the result of serial analysis of gene expression.
TI  - Gene essentiality determines chromosome organisation in bacteria.
AB  - In Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, essentiality, not expressivity, drives the distribution of genes between the two replicating strands. Although essential genes tend to be coded in the leading replicating strand, the underlying selective constraints and the evolutionary extent of these findings have still not been subject to comparative studies. Here, we extend our previous analysis to the genomes of low G + C firmicutes and gamma-proteobacteria, and in a second step to all sequenced bacterial genomes. The inference of essentiality by homology allows us to show that essential genes are much more frequent in the leading strand than other genes, even when compared with non- essential highly expressed genes. Smaller biases were found in the genomes of obligatory intracellular bacteria, for which the assignment of essentiality by homology from fast growing free-living bacteria is most problematic. Cross-comparisons used to assess potential errors in the assignment of essentiality by homology revealed that, in most cases, variations in the assignment criteria have little influence on the overall results. Essential genes tend to be more conserved in the leading strand than average genes, which is consistent with selection for this positioning and may impose a strong constraint on chromosomal rearrangements. These results indicate that essentiality plays a fundamental role in the distribution of genes in most bacterial genomes.
TI  - Characterization of the LlaCI methyltransferase from Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris W15 provides new insights into the biology of type II restriction-modification systems.
AB  - The gene encoding the LlaCI methyltransferase (M.LlaCI) from Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris W15 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity using three consecutive steps of chromatography on phosphocellulose, blue-agarose and Superose 12HR, yielding a protein of M(r) 31 300+/-1000 under denaturing conditions. The exact position of the start codon AUG was determined by protein microsequencing. This enzyme recognizes the specific palindromic sequence 5'-AAGCTT-3'. Purified M.LlaCI was characterized. Unlike many other methyltransferases, M.LlaCI exists in solution predominantly as a dimer. It modifies the first adenine residue at the 5' end of the specific sequence to N(6)-methyladenine and thus is functionally identical to the corresponding methyltransferases of the HindIII (Haemophilus influenzae Rd) and EcoVIII (Escherichia coli E1585-68) restriction-modification systems. This is reflected in the identity of M.LlaCI with M.HindIII and M.EcoVIII noted at the amino acid sequence level (50 % and 62 %, respectively) and in the presence of nine sequence motifs conserved among N(6)-adenine beta-class methyltransferases. However, polyclonal antibodies raised against M.EcoVIII cross-reacted with M.LlaCI but not with M.HindIII. Restriction endonucleases require Mg(2+) for phosphodiester bond cleavage. Mg(2+) was shown to be a strong inhibitor of the M.LlaCI enzyme and its isospecific homologues. This observation suggests that sensitivity of the M.LlaCI to Mg(2+) may strengthen the restriction activity of the cognate endonuclease in the bacterial cell. Other biological implications of this finding are also discussed.
TI  - Genetic analysis of a plasmid encoding haemocin production in Haemophilus paragallinarum.
AB  - The full sequence of plasmid p250, isolated from Haemophilus paragallinarum strain HP250, has been obtained. The plasmid contains seven ORFs: a putative integrase, a putative replication protein (repB) and five ORFs similar to those from the haemocin (bacteriocin) hmcDCBAI operon from Haemophilus influenzae. Of 19 other non-plasmid-containing H. paragallinarum strains screened (11 serovar reference strains and 8 field isolates), 17 strains produced haemocin and were resistant to killing by strain HP250. These strains, unlike strain HP250, have a chromosomally encoded haemocin operon. A number of other members of the family Pasteurellaceae were tested for haemocin sensitivity. Pasteurella avium, Pasteurella volantium and Pasteurella species A, all non-pathogenic bacteria found in the respiratory tract of chickens suffering from respiratory diseases, were sensitive to H. paragallinarum haemocin. However, amongst the pathogenic Pasteurellaceae, 50 % of P. multocida isolates and all five isolates of Pasteurella haemolytica tested were sensitive to the haemocin. Given the prevalence of haemocin production in H. paragallinarum strains, it may play a role in aiding colonization by inhibiting other Gram-negative bacteria that are associated with the respiratory tract in chickens. The origin of replication from plasmid p250 has been used to generate an Escherichia coli-H. paragallinarum shuttle vector which may be useful in genetically manipulating H. paragallinarum.
TI  - Argentinean collaborative multicenter study on the in vitro comparative activity  of piperacillin-tazobactam against selected bacterial isolates recovered from hospitalized patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of piperacillin-tazobactam and several antibacterial drugs  commonly used in Argentinean hospitals for the treatment of severe infections was determined against selected but consecutively isolated strains from clinical specimens recovered from hospitalized patients at 17 different hospitals from 9 Argentinean cities from different geographic areas during the period November 2001-March 2002. Out of 418 Enterobacteriaceae included in the Study 84% were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. ESBLs putative producers were isolated at an extremely high rate since among those isolates obtained from patients with hospital acquired infections 56% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 32% of Proteus mirabilis and 25% Escherichia coli were phenotypically considered as ESBLs producers Notably P.mirabilis is not considered by for screening for ESBL producers. ESBLs producers were 100% susceptible to imipenem and 70% were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam whereas more than 50% were resistant to levofloxacin. The isolates considered as amp C beta lactamase putative producers showed 99% susceptibility to carbapenems while 26.7% were resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam and 38.4% to levofloxacin. Noteworthy only 4% of the Enterobacteriaceae isolates were resistant to amikacin. Piperacillin-tazobactam was the most active agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (MIC(90): 128 microg/ml; 78% susceptibility) but showed poor activity against Acinetobacter spp (MIC(90):>256 microg/ml; 21.7% susceptibility). Only 41.7% Acinetobacter spp isolates were susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam. Piperacillin-tazobactam inhibited 100% of Haemophilus influenzae isolates (MIC(90) < 0.25 microg/ml) but only 16.6% of them were ampicillin resistant. The activity of piperacillin-tazobactam against oxacillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus or coagulase negative staphylococci was excellent (MIC(90) 2 microg/ml; 100% susceptibility). Out of 150 enterococci 12 isolates (8%) were identified as E.faecium and only three isolates (2%), 2 E.faecium and 1 E.faecalis were vancomycin resistant. All the enterococci isolates were susceptible to linezolid. Piperacillin-tazobactam showed excellent activity (MIC(90) 2 microg/ml; 92% susceptibility). Regarding pneumococci all the isolates showed MICs of 16 microg/ml for piperacillin-tazobactam. Among 34 viridans group streptococci only 67% were penicillin susceptible and 85.2% ceftriaxone susceptible whereas piperacillin-tazobactam was very active (MIC(90) 4 microg/ml).Piperacillin-tazobactam is therefore a very interesting antibacterial drug to be used, preferably in combination (IE: amikacin-vancomycin) for the empiric treatment of severe infections occurring in hospitalized patients in Argentina. Caution must be taken for infections due to ESBL producers considering that the inoculum effect MICs can affect MIC values.
TI  - Insights into catalysis by a knotted TrmD tRNA methyltransferase.
AB  - The crystal structure of Escherichia coli tRNA (guanosine-1) methyltransferase (TrmD) complexed with S-adenosyl homocysteine (AdoHcy) has been determined at 2.5A resolution. TrmD, which methylates G37 of tRNAs containing the sequence G36pG37, is a homo-dimer. Each monomer consists of a C-terminal domain connected by a flexible linker to an N-terminal AdoMet-binding domain. The two bound AdoHcy moieties are buried at the bottom of deep clefts. The dimer structure appears integral to the formation of the catalytic center of the enzyme and this arrangement strongly suggests that the anticodon loop of tRNA fits into one of these clefts for methyl transfer to occur. In addition, adjacent hydrophobic sites in the cleft delineate a defined pocket, which may accommodate the GpG sequence during catalysis. The dimer contains two deep trefoil peptide knots and a peptide loop extending from each knot embraces the AdoHcy adenine ring. Mutational analyses demonstrate that the knot is important for AdoMet binding and catalytic activity, and that the C-terminal domain is not only required for tRNA binding but plays a functional role in catalytic activity.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. A total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabillis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp. (P. alcalifaciens, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobactor baumannii, Acinetobactor lwoffii, Bacteroides fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron), and Prevotella spp. (P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. bivia, P. oralis, P. denticola). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, C. freundii, C. koseri, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, Providencia spp., P. aeruginosa, and A. lwoffii throughout 6 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. On the other hand, the MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. The MIC90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against H. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. The present results demonstrated that CZOP had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost Gram-negative strains tested. However, the decrease in antibacterial activities of CZOP against B. cepacia, and H. influenzae was suggested.
TI  - Acute mastoiditis in Southern Israel: a twelve year retrospective study (1990 through 2001).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute mastoiditis is a serious complication of acute otitis media (AOM) and has been increasingly reported in the last decade. OBJECTIVES: To report the experience accumulated with acute mastoiditis at the Soroka University Medical Center, Beer-Sheva, Israel, in a period of increasing antimicrobial resistance with Streptococcus pneumoniae. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the records of all children with acute mastoiditis hospitalized from 1990 through 2001. Acute mastoiditis was diagnosed when one or more of the physical signs of mastoiditis (swelling, erythema, tenderness of the retroauricular area and anteroinferior displacement of the auricle) were diagnosed in the presence of concomitant or recent (< or =4 weeks) AOM. RESULTS: One hundred sixteen episodes of acute mastoiditis occurred in 101 children age 2 months to 14 years (median, 25 months; 19% <1 year old). The average yearly incidence was 6.1 cases per 100 000 population <14 years old, with a significant increase in the number of cases during the study period. Acute mastoiditis was the first evidence of AOM in 10 (10%) patients. Fever >38 degrees C and >15,000 WBC/mm3 were present in 67 and 43% of cases, respectively. Irritability, retroauricular swelling, redness and protrusion of the auricle occurred more commonly in patients <3 years old (79, 90, 84 and 76% vs. 28, 42, 45 and 30%, respectively, in patients > or =3 years old; P < 0.002). Computed tomography scans were performed in 54 of 116 (47%) cases and revealed bone destruction in 38 (70%). Periosteal abscess and lateral sinus vein thrombosis were diagnosed in 8 and 2 patients, respectively. Simple mastoidectomy was done in 32 of 116 (28%) cases, after no response to intravenous antibiotics was observed; ventilation tubes were inserted in 12 patients. Cultures were obtained at admission in 83 (72%) episodes (71 by tympanocentesis and 12 from ear discharges). Overall 43 pathogens were isolated: 34 at admission; 14 at surgery; and 5 at both occasions. The most commonly isolated organisms were S. pneumoniae (14 of 43, 33%; 4 penicillin-nonsusceptible), Streptococcus pyogenes (11 of 43, 26%), nontypable Haemophilus influenzae (6 of 43, 14%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5 of 43, 12%) and Escherichia coli (4 of 43, 9%). All S. pneumoniae organisms were isolated between 1996 and 2001. CONCLUSIONS: (1) The incidence of acute mastoiditis in children in Southern Israel is greater than that reported in the literature; (2) a significant increase in the number of cases was recorded during the study period; (3) the clinical picture of acute mastoiditis was more severe in infants and young children; (4) the pathogen distribution in acute mastoiditis differs from that of AOM with significantly higher rates of S. pyogenes and lower rates of nontypable H. influenzae recovery; (5) penicillin-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae played only a minor role in the etiology of acute mastoiditis in Southern Israel.
TI  - Bacterial polysaccharides as vaccines--immunity and chemical characterization.
AB  - Studies on protective immunity and biochemical characterization of bacterial capsular polysaccharides have led to significant contributions to understanding of the mechanisms of infectious diseases and development of effective vaccines. Immunity to encapsulated bacteria is related to antibody response to polysaccharide (PS) antigen, interactions with T- and B-lymphocytes, and host defense mechanisms. Meningococcal, pneumococcal and Salmonella vi PSs and Haemophilus type b PS-protein conjugate vaccines have been licensed and provided effective immunity for prevention of these bacterial infections. Capsular PSs are cell-surface polymers consisting of oligosaccharide repeating units. Many PSs are highly polar and hydrophilic and interfere with cell-to-cell interactions with phagocytes. Most pneumococcal PSs are negatively charged and possess acidic components such as D-glucuronic acid and phosphate in phosphodiester bonds. Extensive immunologic cross-reactivity has been observed among bacterial capsular PSs. In infants the antibody responses to most capsular PSs are generally poor. Enhanced immunogenicity of PS antigens can be achieved through PS-protein conjugate vaccines, immunization during a critical period of perinatal development and effective antigen delivery system.
TI  - An isolated class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase insertion domain is functional in  amino acid editing.
AB  - Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are responsible for activating specific amino acids and transferring them onto cognate tRNA molecules. Due to the similarity in many amino acid side chains, certain synthetases misactivate non-cognate amino acids to an extent that would be detrimental to protein synthesis if left uncorrected. To ensure accurate translation of the genetic code, some synthetases therefore utilize editing mechanisms to hydrolyze non-cognate products. Previously class II Escherichia coli proline-tRNA synthetase (ProRS) was shown to exhibit pre- and post-transfer editing activity, hydrolyzing a misactivated alanine-adenylate (Ala-AMP) and a mischarged Ala-tRNAPro variant, respectively. Residues critical for the editing activity (Asp-350 and Lys-279) are found in a novel insertion domain (INS) positioned between motifs 2 and 3 of the class defining aminoacylation active site. In this work, we present further evidence that INS is responsible for editing in ProRS. We deleted the INS from wild-type E. coli ProRS to yield DeltaINS-ProRS. While DeltaINS-ProRS was still capable of misactivating alanine, the truncated construct was defective in hydrolyzing non-cognate Ala-AMP. When the INS domain was cloned and expressed as an independent protein, it was capable of deacylating a mischarged Ala-microhelixPro variant. Similar to full-length ProRS, post-transfer editing was abolished in a K279A mutant INS. We also show that YbaK, a protein of unknown function from Haemophilus influenzae with high sequence homology to the prokaryotic INS domain, was capable of deacylating Ala-tRNAPro and Ala-microhelixPro variants but not cognate Pro-tRNAPro. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that an independently folded class II synthetase editing domain and a previously identified homolog can catalyze a hydrolytic editing reaction.
TI  - Structural determinants of SecB recognition by SecA in bacterial protein translocation.
AB  - SecB is a bacterial chaperone involved in directing pre-protein to the translocation pathway by its specific interaction with the peripheral membrane ATPase SecA. The SecB-binding site on SecA is located at its C terminus and consists of a stretch of highly conserved residues. The crystal structure of SecB in complex with the C-terminal 27 amino acids of SecA from Haemophilus influenzae shows that the SecA peptide is structured as a CCCH zinc-binding motif. One SecB tetramer is bound by two SecA peptides, and the interface involves primarily salt bridges and hydrogen bonding interactions. The structure explains the importance of the zinc-binding motif and conserved residues at the C terminus of SecA in its high-affinity binding with SecB. It also suggests a model of SecB-SecA interaction and its implication for the mechanism of pre-protein transfer in bacterial protein translocation.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial potency and spectrum of ABT-492, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - ABT-492 demonstrated potent antibacterial activity against most quinolone-susceptible pathogens. The rank order of potency was ABT-492 > trovafloxacin > levofloxacin > ciprofloxacin against quinolone-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci. ABT-492 had activity comparable to those of trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin against seven species of quinolone-susceptible members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, although it was less active than the comparators against Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens. The activity of ABT-492 was greater than those of the comparators against fastidious gram-negative species, including Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Legionella spp. and against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Helicobacter pylori. ABT-492 was as active as trovafloxacin against Chlamydia trachomatis, indicating good intracellular penetration and antibacterial activity. In particular, ABT-492 was more active than trovafloxacin and levofloxacin against multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin and macrolides, and H. influenzae, including beta-lactam-resistant strains. It retained greater in vitro activity than the comparators against S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae strains resistant to other quinolones due to amino acid alterations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions of the target topoisomerases. ABT-492 was a potent inhibitor of bacterial topoisomerases, and unlike the comparators, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV from either Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli were almost equally sensitive to ABT-492. The profile of ABT-492 suggested that it may be a useful agent for the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections, as well as infections of the urinary tract, bloodstream, and skin and skin structure and nosocomial lung infections.
TI  - Contemporary re-evaluation of the activity and spectrum of grepafloxacin tested against isolates in the United States.
AB  - Grepafloxacin potency and spectrum of activity were re-evaluated against contemporary pathogens collected from clinical infections in 2001-2002. A total of 995 isolates were tested for grepafloxacin by the reference agar dilution method and these results were compared to those of 25 other antimicrobial agents. Grepafloxacin activity remained comparable to that of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae (MIC(90), 0.03-2 microg/ml; 0.0-7.7% resistance rates). For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, grepafloxacin was active against ciprofloxacin-susceptible (MIC(90), 2 microg/ml), but not against ciprofloxacin-resistant (MIC(90), >8 microg/ml) isolates. Against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, grepafloxacin susceptibility rate was 91.4%, equal to that of levofloxacin. None of the fluoroquinolones showed reasonable activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Gatifloxacin and grepafloxacin had the same MIC(90) against beta-hemolytic streptococci (0.25 microg/ml) and penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.25 microg/ml). Grepafloxacin and other fluoroquinolone activities were not influenced by penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae. Grepafloxacin was very active against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC(90), 0.03 microg/ml), Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC(90), 0.03 microg/ml) and Legionella spp. (MIC(90), 0.5 microg/ml). These results on recently isolated organisms indicate that grepafloxacin has a sustained potency and spectrum against most clinically important and indicated pathogens.
TI  - Glutathione and catalase provide overlapping defenses for protection against respiration-generated hydrogen peroxide in Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Glutathione is an abundant and ubiquitous low-molecular-weight thiol that may play a role in many cellular processes, including protection against the deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species. We address here the role of glutathione in protection against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in Haemophilus influenzae and show that glutathione and catalase provide overlapping defense systems. H. influenzae is naturally glutathione deficient and imports glutathione from the growth medium. Mutant H. influenzae lacking catalase and cultured in glutathione-deficient minimal medium is completely devoid of H2O2 scavenging activity and, accordingly, substantial amounts of H2O2 accumulate in the growth medium. H. influenzae generates H2O2 at rates similar to those reported for Escherichia coli, but the toxicity of this harmful metabolite is averted by glutathione-based H2O2 removal, which appears to be the primary system for protection against H2O2 endogenously generated during aerobic respiration. When H2O2 concentrations exceed low micromolar levels, the hktE gene-encoded catalase becomes the predominant scavenger. The requirement for glutathione in protection against oxidative stress is analogous to that in higher and lower eukaryotes but is unlike the situation in other bacteria in which glutathione is dispensable for aerobic growth during both normal and oxidative stress conditions.
TI  - Crystal structure of the SF3 helicase from adeno-associated virus type 2.
AB  - We report here the crystal structure of an SF3 DNA helicase, Rep40, from adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2). We show that AAV2 Rep40 is structurally more similar to the AAA(+) class of cellular proteins than to DNA helicases from other superfamilies. The structure delineates the expected Walker A and B motifs, but also reveals an unexpected "arginine finger" that directly implies the requirement of Rep40 oligomerization for ATP hydrolysis and helicase activity. Further, the Rep40 AAA(+) domain is novel in that it is unimodular as opposed to bimodular. Altogether, the structural connection to AAA(+) proteins defines the general architecture of SF3 DNA helicases, a family that includes simian virus 40 (SV40) T antigen, as well as provides a conceptual framework for understanding the role of Rep proteins during AAV DNA replication, packaging, and site-specific integration.
TI  - Shikimate dehydrogenase structure reveals novel fold.
AB  - The structure of shikimate 5-dehydrogenase, the fourth enzyme in the shikimate biosynthesis pathway and a member of a large enzyme family without clear structural peer, reveals a novel topological fold for the substrate binding domain and, through homology modeling, expands the possibilities for antimicrobial and herbicide design.
TI  - Systemic metabolic reactions are obtained by singular value decomposition of genome-scale stoichiometric matrices.
AB  - Genome-scale metabolic networks can be reconstructed. The systemic biochemical properties of these networks can now be studied. Here, genome-scale reconstructed metabolic networks were analysed using singular value decomposition (SVD). All the individual biochemical conversions contained in a reconstructed metabolic network are described by a stoichiometric matrix (S). SVD of S led to the definition of the underlying modes that characterize the overall biochemical conversions that take place in a network and rank-ordered their importance. The modes were shown to correspond to systemic biochemical reactions and they could be used to identify the groups and clusters of individual biochemical reactions that drive them. Comparative analysis of the Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Helicobacter pylori genome-scale metabolic networks showed that the four dominant modes in all three networks correspond to: (1) the conversion of ATP to ADP, (2) redox metabolism of NADP, (3) proton-motive force, and (4) inorganic phosphate metabolism. The sets of individual metabolic reactions deriving these systemic conversions, however, differed among the three organisms. Thus, we can now define systemic metabolic reactions, or eigen-reactions, for the study of systems biology of metabolism and have a basis for comparing the overall properties of genome-specific metabolic networks.
TI  - [Surveillance on drug resistance of gram-negative bacilli isolated from hospital  acquired infections and community acquired infections (2000 - 2001)].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the resistance rates of gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with hospital acquired infections (HAI) or community acquired infections (CAI) in the 34 study wards of 13 hospitals located at different areas in China. METHODS: 1596 strains of gram-negative bacilli from the 2401 pathogenic strains isolated from 13 hospitals 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 were collected for susceptibility test using international standard two-fold agar dilution method. According to the criteria of guidelines of NCCLS (2001), MIC(50) and MIC(90) were detected for antibacterial activity of antimicrobial agents and R%, I%, and S%, were calculated to show the resistant, intermediate and susceptible rates of bacteria to the compounds tested. RESULTS: 15 species of gram-negative pathogens were isolated and most of them could be isolated from both CAI and HAI patients. The resistance rates of isolates, especially Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia spp. and Acinetobacter spp. from HAI were higher than those of CAI. The carbopenems were the most active compounds tested against Enterobacteriaceae. Cefoperozone/sulbactam and cefprime demonstrated excellent activity against most of Gram-negative bacilli. Most of the Gram-negative bacilli were still rather susceptible to cefatazidime, a third generation cephalosporin, with a susceptibility rate of 70% to 100%. Fluoroquinolones showed strong and broad-spectrum activity against Gram-negative bacilli, but more than 50% of Escherichia coli strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones, and the susceptible rates to fluoroquinolones of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae had decreased. CONCLUSION: (1) The results obtained in the two surveillance-years, 2000 - 2001 and 1998 - 1999, were similar in the bacterial resistance pattern and the trend of rising of resistant rates for some Gram-negative pathogens. (2) The resistance rates of isolates from HAI patients were higher than those of CAI.
TI  - Haemophilus influenzae Rd lacks a stringently conserved fatty acid biosynthetic enzyme and thermal control of membrane lipid composition.
AB  - The organization of the fatty acid synthetic genes of Haemophilus influenzae Rd is remarkably similar to that of the paradigm organism, Escherichia coli K-12, except that no homologue of the E. coli fabF gene is present. This finding is unexpected, since fabF is very widely distributed among bacteria and is thought to be the generic 3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) synthase active on long-chain-length substrates. However, H. influenzae Rd contains a homologue of the E. coli fabB gene, which encodes a 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase required for unsaturated fatty acid synthesis, and it seemed possible that the H. influenzae FabB homologue might have acquired the functions of FabF. E. coli mutants lacking fabF function are unable to regulate the compositions of membrane phospholipids in response to growth temperature. We report in vivo evidence that the enzyme encoded by the H. influenzae fabB gene has properties essentially identical to those of E. coli FabB and lacks FabF activity. Therefore, H. influenzae grows without FabF function. Moreover, as predicted from studies of the E. coli fabF mutants, H. influenzae is unable to change the fatty acid compositions of its membrane phospholipids with growth temperature. We also demonstrate that the fabB gene of Vibrio cholerae El Tor N16961 does not contain a frameshift mutation as was previously reported.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of three fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates by E test.
AB  - The in vitro susceptibility of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against several gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates was tested by E test. We found that the MIC(50) and MIC(90) values against all members of the Enterobacteriaceae family except Serratia were <0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin (MIC range 0.006-32 mg/l) based on the in vitro susceptibility data. The susceptibility rates for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more than 85% for Escherichia coli, citrobacter, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae, although Serratia and Acinetobacter exhibited more or less similar susceptibility rates (about 80%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance to fluoroquinolones (MIC(90) >32 mg/l) and decreased bactericidal rates (<65%) to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Respiratory pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were highly susceptible (100%) to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. The ineffectiveness of fluoroquinolones for treating coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus was demonstrated by poor in vitro susceptibility rates with levofloxacin (52%) and moxifloxacin (57%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci demonstrated significantly decreased bactericidal rates to levofloxacin (21%), while the in vitro susceptibility to moxifloxacin was higher (66%) than that to levofloxacin. We propose that the beneficial effect of inclusion of any of these three fluoroquinolones in treating Enterococcus infections is marginal, as demonstrated by significantly reduced susceptibility rates (<32%). These data demonstrate the utility of fluoroquinoles to treat several gram-negative bacterial infections (with the exception of Acinetobacter and P. aeruginosa), as well as S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae.
TI  - Haemophilus influenzae bla(ROB-1) mutations in hypermutagenic deltaampC Escherichia coli conferring resistance to cefotaxime and beta-lactamase inhibitors and increased susceptibility to cefaclor.
AB  - The clinical use of cefaclor has been shown to enrich Haemophilus influenzae populations harboring cefaclor-hydrolyzing ROB-1 beta-lactamase. Such a selective process may lead to the increased use of extended-spectrum cephalosporins or beta-lactams plus beta-lactamase inhibitors and, eventually, resistance to these agents, which has not previously been observed in H. influenzae. In order to establish which bla(ROB-1) mutations, if any, could confer resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins and/or to beta-lactamase inhibitors, a plasmid harboring bla(ROB-1) was transformed into hypermutagenic strain Escherichia coli GB20 (DeltaampC mutS::Tn10), and this construct was used in place of H. influenzae bla(ROB-1). Strain GB20 with the cloned gene was submitted to serial passages in tubes containing broth with increasing concentrations of selected beta-lactams (cefotaxime or amoxicillin-clavulanate). Different mutations in the bla(ROB-1) gene were obtained during the passages in the presence of the different concentrations of the selective agents. Mutants resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins harbored either the Leu169-->Ser169 or the Arg164-->Trp164 substitution or the double amino acid change Arg164-->Trp164 and Ala237-->Thr237. ROB-1 mutants that were resistant to beta-lactams plus beta-lactamase inhibitors and that harbored the Arg244-->Cys244 or the Ser130-->Gly130 replacement were also obtained. The cefaclor-hydrolyzing efficiencies of the ROB-1 variants were strongly decreased in all mutants, suggesting that if bla(ROB-1) mutants were selected by cefaclor, this drug would prevent the further evolution of this beta-lactamase toward molecular forms able to resist extended-spectrum cephalosporins or beta-lactamase inhibitors.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of novel 2-(thiazol-2-ylthio)-1beta-methylcarbapenems with potent activities against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - SM-197436, SM-232721, and SM-232724 are new 1beta-methylcarbapenems with a unique 4-substituted thiazol-2-ylthio moiety at the C-2 side chain. In agar dilution susceptibility testing these novel carbapenems were active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) with a MIC(90) of </=4 micro g/ml. Furthermore, SM-232724 showed strong bactericidal activity against MRSA, in contrast to linezolid, which was bacteriostatic up to four times the MIC. SM-232724 showed good therapeutic efficacy comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid against systemic infections of MRSA in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. The MICs of SM-197436, SM-232721, and SM-232724 for streptococci, including penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, ranged from </=0.063 to 0.5 micro g/ml. These drugs were the most active beta-lactams tested against Enterococcus faecium, and the MIC(90) s for ampicillin-resistant E. faecium ranged between 8 and 16 micro g/ml, which were slightly higher than the value for linezolid. However, time-kill assays revealed the superior bactericidal activity of SM-232724 compared to those of quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid against an E. faecium strain with a 4-log reduction in CFU at four times the MIC after 24 h of exposure to antibiotics. In addition, SM-232724 significantly reduced the numbers of bacteria in a murine abscess model with the E. faecium strain: its efficacy was superior to that of linezolid, although the MICs (2 micro g/ml) of these two agents are the same. Among gram-negative bacteria, these three carbapenems were highly active against Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), Moraxella catarrhalis, and Bacteroides fragilis, and showed antibacterial activity equivalent to that of imipenem for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus spp. Thus, these new carbapenems are promising candidates for agents to treat nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, especially multiresistant gram-positive cocci, including MRSA and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
TI  - A prospective study of infections in lung cancer patients admitted to the hospital.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the type of infections occurring in hospitalized patients with lung cancer. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Department of internal medicine in a cancer hospital. PATIENTS: All patients with lung cancer who were hospitalized for any cause and who acquired infections at the time of admission or during the hospital stay between January 1997 and February 2001. INTERVENTIONS: None. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-five patients with lung cancer had 435 episodes of fever and/or microbiologically or otherwise documented infection. Two hundred eighteen patients (79.3%) presented with non-small cell lung carcinoma, while 49 patients (17.8%) had small cell lung cancer. The majority of the infections occurred in the tracheobronchial tree (56%). There were 38 episodes of bacteremia or fungemia, and the primary site of infection was identified in 18 cases (47%). Microbiologically documented infections accounted for 61% of the infectious episodes, and included a total of 312 microorganisms. The most frequent pathogens were Gram-negative bacteria (64%), followed by Gram-positive bacteria (25%) and fungi (8%). The predominant Gram-negative bacteria were Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Enterococcus faecalis essentially represented the Gram-positive bacteria. No multiresistant bacteria were observed. Bacteria were susceptible to most of the antibiotics classically administered for their treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The predominant site of infection in patients with lung cancer is the tracheobronchial tree, with S pneumoniae, S aureus, H influenzae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and M catarrhalis as the principal pathogens.
TI  - The influence of maternal immunization on light chain response to Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine.
AB  - The repertoire of human antibodies to Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide (Hib PS) has been extensively characterized. In response to Hib PS vaccines, both IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies are produced. Based on the Vkappa gene used for the antibodies, heamophilus antibodies can be divided into A2 and non-A2 antibodies. A2 antibodies account for the majority of heamophilus antibodies, are generally more functional, and are specific for heamophilus polysaccharide. In contrast, non-A2 antibodies cross-react with Escherichia coli K100. Studies of placental transfer showed that IgG1 antibodies cross the placenta better than IgG2 antibodies and the A2 antibodies better than non-A2 antibodies. Babies born to mothers who were immunized with a heamophilus vaccine had a high level of antibodies to Hib PS but the antibody level decreased during the first 6 months. The children also responded to a heamophilus conjugate vaccine.
TI  - Construction of recombinant S-layer proteins (rSbsA) and their expression in bacterial ghosts--a delivery system for the nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae antigen Omp26.
AB  - This study has investigated the feasibility of a combination of recombinant surface layer (S-layer) proteins and empty bacterial cell envelopes (ghosts) to deliver candidate antigens for a vaccine against nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) infections. The S-layer gene sbsA from Bacillus stearothermophilus PV72 was used for the construction of fusion proteins. Fusion of maltose binding protein (MBP) to the N-terminus of SbsA allowed expression of the S-layer in the periplasm of Escherichia coli. The outer membrane protein (Omp) 26 of NTHi was inserted into the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of SbsA. The presence of the fused antigen Omp26 was demonstrated by Western blot experiments using anti-Omp26 antisera. Electron microscopy showed that the recombinant SbsA maintained the ability to self-assemble into sheet-like and cylindrical structures. Recombinant E. coli cell envelopes (ghosts) were produced by the expression of SbsA/Omp26 fusion proteins prior to gene E-mediated lysis. Intraperitoneal immunization with these recombinant bacterial ghosts induced an Omp26-specific antibody response in BALB/c mice. These results demonstrate that the NTHi antigen, Omp26, was expressed in the S-layer self-assembly product and this construct was immunogenic for Omp26 when administered to mice in bacterial cell envelopes.
TI  - The EmulSiv filter removes microbial contamination from propofol but is not a substitute for aseptic technique.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the ability of the EmulSiv filter (EF) to remove extrinsic microbial contaminants from propofol. METHODS: Aliquots of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Candida albicans (C. albicans), Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), Moraxella osloensis (M. osloensis), Enterobacter agglomerans (E. agglomerans), Escherichia coli (E. coli), Serratia marcescens (S. marcescens), Moraxella catarrhalis (M. catarrhalis), Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) and Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) were inoculated into vials containing 20 mL of sterile propofol. The unfiltered inoculated propofol solutions served as controls. Ten millilitres and 20 mL samples of the inoculated propofol were filtered through the EF. All solutions were then subplated onto three culture plates using a precision 1 micro L calibrated platinum loop and incubated. The number of colony forming units (CFU) were counted. Data were analyzed using a one-sample t test, and a P value of less than 0.05 was selected as the level of statistical significance. RESULTS: The EF was able to completely remove CFU of S. aureus, C. albicans, K. pneumoniae, M. osloensis, E. agglomerans, E. coli, S. marcescens, and M. catarrhalis (P < 0.05). A small number of H. influenzae CFU were able to evade filtration in both the 10 mL and 20 mL samples. C. jejuni CFU were able to evade filtration in only the 10 mL sample. CONCLUSIONS: The EF removes the majority of microbial contaminates from propofol with the exception of H. influenzae and C. jejuni. Although the EF is capable of removing most of the microbial contamination produced by H. influenzae and C. jejuni, a few CFU are capable of evading filtration. Consequently, even the use of a filter capable of removing microbial contaminants is not a substitute for meticulous aseptic technique and prompt administration when propofol is used.
TI  - Species specificity in the activation of Xer recombination at dif by FtsK.
AB  - In Escherichia coli, chromosome dimers are resolved to monomers by the addition of a single cross-over at a specific locus on the chromosome, dif. Recombination is performed by two tyrosine recombinases, XerC and XerD, and requires the action of an additional protein, FtsK. We show that Haemophilus influenzae FtsK activates recombination by H. influenzae XerCD at H. influenzae dif. However, it cannot activate recombination by E. coli XerCD. Reciprocally, E. coli FtsK cannot activate recombination by the H. influenzae recombinases at H. influenzae dif. We took advantage of this species specificity to gain further insight into the mechanism of activation of Xer recombination at dif by FtsK. We mapped the region of FtsK implicated in species specificity to the extreme 140-amino-acid C-terminal residues of the protein. Our results suggest that FtsK interacts directly with XerCD in order to activate recombination at dif.
TI  - Characterization and expression of adjacent proline iminopeptidase and aspartase  genes from Eikenella corrodens.
AB  - Two adjacent genes involved in nitrogen metabolism from Eikenella corrodens, with a potential role in pathogenesis, were studied. Proline iminopeptidase (Pip) activity, which may be essential for energy production and protection against host immune mechanisms, is exhibited by E. corrodens. Analysis of Pip-expressing clones revealed an ORF of 939 bases with a predicted amino acid sequence identity of 67% to the Pip of Neisseria gonorrhoea. 200 bp downstream from pip, an ORF of 1395 bases, encoding a protein with 87% identity to a putative aspartase from the Neisseria meningitidis genome sequence, was identified. Enzymatic function was confirmed with a complemented Escherichia coli aspartase deficient mutant. The E. corrodens aspartase was found to be 77% identical to the Haemophilus influenzae aspartase sequence, which was originally identified on the basis of its ability to bind plasminogen. However, the E. corrodens aspartase had no such activity. Southern hybridization indicated both genes to be single copy and conserved within the genomes of a diverse panel of E. corrodens isolates from health and disease.
TI  - [Multilocus sequence-typing for characterization of Moscow strains of Haemophilus influenzae type b].
AB  - Haemophilius influenzae, type b (Hib) bacteria, were genotyped by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) using 5 loci (adk, fucK, mdh, pgi, recA). 42 Moscow Hib strains (including 38 isolates form cerebrospinal fluid of children, who had purulent meningitis in 1999-2001, and 4 strains isolated from healthy carriers of Hib), as well as 2 strains from Yekaterinburg were studied. In MLST a strain is characterized, by alleles and their combinations (an allele profile) referred to also as sequence-type (ST). 9 Sts were identified within the Russian Hib bacteria: ST-1 was found in 25 strains (57%), ST-12 was found in 8 strains (18%), ST-11 was found in 4 strains (9%) and ST-15 was found in 2 strains (4.5%); all other STs strains (13, 14, 16, 17, 51) were found in isolated cases (2.3%). A comparison of allelic profiles and of nucleotide sequences showed that 93% of Russian isolates, i.e. strain with ST-1, 11, 12, 13, 15 and 17, belong to one and the same clonal complex. 2 isolates from Norway and Sweden from among 7 foreign Hib strains studied up to now can be described as belonging to the same clonal complex; 5 Hib strains were different from the Russian ones.
TI  - Amoxicillin-sulbactam: A clinical and therapeutic review.
AB  - Combinations of beta-lactamase inhibitors with penicillins, especially aminopenicillins, have broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against most of the common pathogens of the respiratory and urinary tracts. This means that they are an ideal treatment for infections such as otitis media, sinusitis, special cases of pharyngeal tonsillitis (recurring forms, indirect pathogenic action, or after the failure of amoxicillin monotherapy), acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, cystitis, urethritis, etc. The amoxicillin-sulbactam combination is active against both beta-lactamase producer and nonproducer strains, and is effective against Gram-positive cocci (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus of nonhospital origin), Gram-negative cocci (Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella catarrhalis and others), Gram-negative bacilli (nonhospital strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae and others) and anaerobes. Its antimicrobial activity means that it is indicated in the treatment of respiratory, ear, nose and throat, urinary, dermatological and gynecological infections caused by susceptible germs, as well as in a variety of surgical situations (both as a treatment and as prophylaxis). It is absorbed very well orally, and its pharmacokinetic profile is very favorable, with very good tissue penetration. It is reasonably well tolerated: in a variable percentage of cases it may cause modification of intestinal transit and/or fecal consistency, which usually abates spontaneously. The new formulation for administration at intervals of 12 h is easier to use, is better tolerated and favors completion of therapy. In summary, the amoxicillin-sulbactam combination is effective and well tolerated in most infections of nonhospital origin in adults and children. (c) 2001 Prous Science. All rights reserved.
TI  - Functional characterization of HgbB, a new hemoglobin binding protein of Pasteurella multocida.
AB  - The biological function and role in pathogenesis of a Pasteurella multocida A:1 strain hemoglobin binding protein was investigated. The hgbB gene from the P. multocida A:1 strain, VP161, was cloned and characterized. hgbB was 2991 bp in length and encoded a mature length protein of 111 kDa. HgbB was predicted to be an outer membrane protein and shared 68 and 69% similarity to the hemoglobin/hemoglobin-haptoglobin binding protein, HI0712 from Haemophilus influenzae Rd and HgpC, from H. influenzae b, respectively. HgbB exhibited features typical of TonB dependent receptors, including seven conserved regions typical of these proteins, and conserved invariant residues. Escherichia coli expressing recombinant HgbB was found to bind hemoglobin in a solid phase dot blot binding assay. However, when a truncated form of the protein was expressed in E. coli, cells could no longer bind hemoglobin. Insertional inactivation of hgbB did not affect the ability of P. multocida to bind hemoglobin, nor its ability to produce disease in a mouse model. In addition, recombinant HgbB did not confer any protection against homologous or heterologous challenge.
TI  - The molecular class C acid phosphatase of Chryseobacterium meningosepticum (OlpA) is a broad-spectrum nucleotidase with preferential activity on 5'-nucleotides.
AB  - The olpA gene of Chryseobacterium meningosepticum, encoding a molecular class C phosphatase, was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The gene encodes a 29-kDa polypeptide containing an amino-terminal signal peptide typical of bacterial membrane lipoproteins. Expression in E. coli results in a functional product that mostly partitions in the outer membrane. A secreted soluble OlpA derivative (sOlpA) lacking the N-terminal cysteine residue for lipid anchoring was produced in E. coli and purified by means of two steps of ion exchange chromatography. Analysis of the kinetic parameters of sOlpA with several organic phosphoesters revealed that the enzyme was able to efficiently hydrolyze nucleotide monophosphates, with a strong preference for 5'-nucleotides and for 3'-AMP. The enzyme was also able to hydrolyze sugar phosphates and beta-glycerol phosphate, although with a lower efficiency, whereas it was apparently inactive against nucleotide di- and triphosphates, diesters, and phytate. OlpA, therefore, can be considered a broad-spectrum nucleotidase with preference for 5'-nucleotides. Its functional behaviour exhibits differences from that of the Haemophilus influenzae OMP P4 lipoprotein, revealing functional heterogeneity among phosphatases of molecular class C.
TI  - Genetic organization and molecular analysis of the EcoVIII restriction-modification system of Escherichia coli E1585-68 and its comparison with isospecific homologs.
AB  - The EcoVIII restriction-modification (R-M) system is carried by the Escherichia coli E1585-68 natural plasmid pEC156 (4,312 bp). The two genes were cloned and characterized. The G+C content of the EcoVIII R-M system is 36.1%, which is significantly lower than the average G+C content of either plasmid pEC156 (43.6%) or E. coli genomic DNA (50.8%). The difference suggests that there is a possibility that the EcoVIII R-M system was recently acquired by the genome. The 921-bp EcoVIII endonuclease (R. EcoVIII) gene (ecoVIIIR) encodes a 307-amino-acid protein with an M(r) of 35,554. The convergently oriented EcoVIII methyltransferase (M. EcoVIII) gene (ecoVIIIM) consists of 912 bp that code for a 304-amino-acid protein with an M(r) of 33,930. The exact positions of the start codon AUG were determined by protein microsequencing. Both enzymes recognize the specific palindromic sequence 5'-AAGCTT-3'. Preparations of EcoVIII R-M enzymes purified to homogeneity were characterized. R. EcoVIII acts as a dimer and cleaves a specific sequence between two adenine residues, leaving 4-nucleotide 5' protruding ends. M. EcoVIII functions as a monomer and modifies the first adenine residue at the 5' end of the specific sequence to N(6)-methyladenine. These enzymes are thus functionally identical to the corresponding enzymes of the HindIII (Haemophilus influenzae Rd) and LlaCI (Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris W15) R-M systems. This finding is reflected by the levels of homology of M. EcoVIII with M. HindIII and M. LlaCI at the amino acid sequence level (50 and 62%, respectively) and by the presence of nine sequence motifs conserved among m(6) N-adenine beta-class methyltransferases. The deduced amino acid sequence of R. EcoVIII shows weak homology with its two isoschizomers, R. HindIII (26%) and R. LlaCI (17%). A catalytic sequence motif characteristic of restriction endonucleases was found in the primary structure of R. EcoVIII (D(108)X(12)DXK(123)), as well as in the primary structures of R. LlaCI and R. HindIII. Polyclonal antibodies raised against R. EcoVIII did not react with R. HindIII, while anti-M. EcoVIII antibodies cross-reacted with M. LlaCI but not with M. HindIII. R. EcoVIII requires Mg(II) ions for phosphodiester bond cleavage. We found that the same ions are strong inhibitors of the M. EcoVIII enzyme. The biological implications of this finding are discussed.
TI  - [Current epidemiological and clinical features meningitis in a northern Italian area]
AB  - Objectives: To study etiological, epidemiological and clinical features of 97 cases of acute meningitis. Methods: Ninety-seven cases of acute meningitis were examined in adult HIV-negative patients admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of the Azienda Ospedale-Universita S. Anna in Ferrara. Demographic, etiological, epidemiological and clinical data were analyzed. Results: All cases were divided into two groups according to the macroscopic aspect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): purulent CSF (50 cases) or non-purulent CSF (47 cases). Purulent CSF meningitis more frequently affected male patients (64% vs 47%) and older patients (average 52 vs 44 years). The main epidemiological features in both groups were underlying bacterial diseases (i.e. otomastoiditis and/or sinusitis in 50% of pneumococcal meningitis) and iatrogenic immunodeficiency. From a clinical point of view the following alterations in the state of consciousness (stupor, confusion and coma) were most frequently found in purulent meningitis. The following non purulent forms of meningitis were diagnosed: 5 tubercular, 3 viral infections, 2 by Listeria monocytogenes, 1 by Entoameba histolytica, 1 by Cryptococcus neoformans and 35 (74,4%) unknown causes. Purulent meningitis were: 20 (40%) Streptococcus pneumoniae, 10 Neisseria meningitidis, 3 Staphylococcus aureus, 2 Escherichia coli, 1 Haemophilus influenzae and 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 13 cases were unidentified. From 1989 to 1993 and from 1994-98 both groups of meningitis increased; respectively from 17 to 30 cases for non-purulent meningitis and from 18 to 32 cases for purulent meningitis. Meningitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae increased from 27.7% to 46.8% during the period 1994-98. Conclusions: The study shows the high incidence of pneumococcal meningitis, during 1994-98, because a large number of patients with sinusitis and otomastoiditis were observed. The incidence of meningococcal meningitis appears stable. These data confirm the importance of timely diagnosis and correct therapy for such infections with reserved prognosis.
TI  - Role of surface-exposed loops of Haemophilus influenzae protein P2 in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade.
AB  - The outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria contains several proteins, and some  of these proteins, the porins, have numerous biological functions in the interaction with the host; porins are involved in the activation of signal transduction pathways and, in particular, in the activation of the Raf/MEK1-MEK2/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. The P2 porin is the most abundant outer membrane protein of Haemophilus influenzae type b. A three-dimensional structural model for P2 was constructed based on the crystal structures of Klebsiella pneumoniae OmpK36 and Escherichia coli PhoE and OmpF. The protein was readily assembled into the beta-barrel fold characteristic of porins, despite the low sequence identity with the template proteins. The model provides information on the structural features of P2 and insights relevant for prediction of domains corresponding to surface-exposed loops, which could be involved in the activation of signal transduction pathways. To identify the role of surface-exposed loops, a set of synthetic peptides were synthesized according to the proposed model and were assayed for MEK1-MEK2/MAPK pathway activation. Our results show that synthetic peptides corresponding to surface loops of protein P2 are able to activate the MEK1-MEK2/MAPK pathways like the entire protein, while peptides modeled on internal beta strands are unable to induce significant phosphorylation of the MEK1-MEK2/MAPK pathways. In particular, the peptides corresponding to loops L5 (Lys206 to Gly219), L6B (Ser239 to Lys253), and L7 (Thr280 to Lys287) activate, as the whole protein, essentially JNK and p38.
TI  - Neisseria meningitidis App, a new adhesin with autocatalytic serine protease activity.
AB  - Neisseria meningitidis is a Gram-negative bacterium which colonizes the human upper respiratory tract. Occasionally, it translocates to the bloodstream causing sepsis and from there it can cross the blood-brain barrier and cause meningitis. Many of the molecules, which mediate the interaction of N. meningitidis to host cells, are still unknown. Recently, App (Adhesion and penetration protein) was described as a member of the autotransporter family and a homologue to the Hap (Haemophilus adhesion and penetration) protein of Haemophilus influenzae, a molecule that plays a role in the interaction with human epithelial cells. In this study we expressed app in Escherichia coli in order to analyse the functional properties of the protein. We show that the protein is exported to the E. coli surface, processed by an endogenous serine-protease activity and released in the culture supernatant. Escherichia coli expressing app adhere to Chang epithelial cells, showing that App is able to mediate bacterial adhesion to host cells. The serine protease activity is localized at the amino-terminal domain, whereas the binding domain is in the carboxy-terminal region. The role of App in adhesion was confirmed also in N. meningitidis.
TI  - What have we learnt from community-acquired infections in Hong Kong?
AB  - This study was initiated throughout Hong Kong, to reveal the characteristics of community-acquired infections. All specimens collected by general practitioners from infected patients were followed prospectively, and those that were culture-positive were analysed. Four thousand seven hundred and forty-one specimens were collected from 3977 patients by 89 doctors from July 2000 to October 2001. The most common specimens were throat swabs (33%), urine (26%) and sputa (16%). The average culture-positive rate was 28%. The most common organisms were Escherichia coli (18%), beta-haemolytic streptococci (15%) and Staphylococcus aureus (12%). Fluoroquinolone resistance was relatively high (up to 35%) in organisms commonly causing urinary tract infection (E. coli, Proteus and Morganella). Although none of the pneumococci was resistant to penicillin 1 mg/L, the proportion with intermediate resistance (0.1-1 mg/L) was alarming (81%). There were three strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus. A decrease in ampicillin resistance but a high prevalence of macrolide resistance were noted in Haemophilus influenzae. All Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates were resistant to penicillin, up to 79% to the fluoroquinolones, 15% to spectinomycin, but all were susceptible to ceftriaxone. Respiratory pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-haemolytic streptococci and H. influenzae) were relatively susceptible to the newer fluoroquinolones (0-2%, 0.5-6% and 2% resistant, respectively) or third-generation cephalosporins (0-2% resistant). The distribution of organisms and their antibiotic resistance varied over time. Thus frequent surveillance is needed to provide information on the drugs of choice for different infections.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of the prokaryotic proteasome homolog HslVU (ClpQY) from Thermotoga maritima and the crystal structure of HslV.
AB  - Heat-shock locus VU (HslVU) is an ATP-dependent proteolytic system and a prokaryotic homolog of the proteasome. It consists of HslV, the protease, and HslU, the ATPase and chaperone. We have cloned, sequenced and expressed both protein components from the hyperthermophile Thermotoga maritima. T. maritima HslU hydrolyzes a variety of nucleotides in a temperature-dependent manner, with the optimum lying between 75 and 80 degrees C. It is also nucleotide-unspecific for activation of HslV against amidolytic and caseinolytic activity. The Escherichia coli and T. maritima HslU proteins mutually stimulate HslV proteins from both sources, suggesting a conserved activation mechanism. The crystal structure of T. maritima HslV was determined and refined to 2.1-A resolution. The structure of the dodecameric enzyme is well conserved compared to those from E. coli and Haemophilus influenzae. A comparison of known HslV structures confirms the presence of a cation-binding site, although its exact role in the proteolytic mechanism of HslV remains unclear. Amongst factors responsible for the thermostability of T. maritima HslV, extensive ionic interactions/salt-bridge networks, which occur specifically in the T. maritima enzyme in comparison to its mesophilic counterparts, seem to play an important role.
TI  - Arabidopsis proteins containing similarity to the universal stress protein domain of bacteria.
AB  - We have collected a set of 44 Arabidopsis proteins with similarity to the USPA (universal stress protein A of Escherichia coli) domain of bacteria. The USPA domain is found either in small proteins, or it makes up the N-terminal portion of a larger protein, usually a protein kinase. Phylogenetic tree analysis based upon a multiple sequence alignment of the USPA domains shows that these domains of protein kinases 1.3.1 and 1.3.2 form distinct groups, as do the protein kinases 1.4.1. This indicates that their USPA domain structures have diverged appreciably and suggests that they may subserve distinct cellular functions. Two USPA fold classes have been proposed: one based on Methanococcus jannaschii MJ0577 (1MJH) that binds ATP, and the other based on the Haemophilus influenzae universal stress protein (1JMV), highly similar to E. coli UspA, which does not bind ATP. A set of common residues involved in ATP binding in 1MJH and conserved in similar bacterial sequences is also found in a distinct cluster of Arabidopsis sequences. Threading analysis, which examines aspects of secondary and tertiary structure, confirms this Arabidopsis sequence cluster as highly similar to 1MJH. This structural approach can distinguish between the characteristic fold differences of 1MJH-like and 1JMV-like bacterial proteins and was used to assign the complete set of candidate Arabidopsis proteins to one of these fold classes. It is clear that all the plant sequences have arisen from a 1MJH-like ancestor.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime against clinical isolates in 2000 and 2001].
AB  - As the post-marketing surveillance of cefpodoxime proxetil (Banan), MICs of cefpodoxime (CPDX, an active form of Banan) against 1090 clinical isolates of 22 species from 15 medical institutions all over Japan from June 2000 to March 2001 were measured using the broth microdilution method approved by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and compared with those of oral cephem antibacterials, cefaclor, cefdinir, cefditoren, and cefcapene. In this study, remarkable change in the activity of CPDX was observed in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae compared with the susceptibility in the studies before Banan was launched. This cause is considered to be the increase in the incidence of the following resistant strains: penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (47.3%), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP, 15.1%), and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) H. influenzae (24.0%), which were scarcely isolated in 1989 when Banan was launched. Other tested drugs also exhibited low activity against these resistant strains. However, CPDX showed comparatively good activity with MIC90 of 2 micrograms/mL against PRSP. Against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, CPDX also showed comparatively good activity with MIC90 of < or = 4 micrograms/mL, which was almost equal to that in the studies before its marketing. Against quinolones-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, CPDX showed excellent activity with MIC90 of 0.5 microgram/mL. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae except for Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii, CPDX showed good activity. However, in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. Proteus spp., and Providencia spp., there are some high-resistant strains to all tested drugs including CPDX. Against Peptostreptococcus spp., MIC90 of CPDX was 8 micrograms/mL and its MIC range was widely distributed from 0.03 to 32 micrograms/mL, which were similar to those in the studies before its marketing. In this study, CPDX showed the decrease in the activity against several species as did other drugs tested, but against most of species tested, CPDX maintained good activity. Furthermore, it is necessary to pay much attention to the trend of resistant strains.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of panipenem against clinical isolates in 2000 and 2001].
AB  - As the post-marketing surveillance of panipenem/betamipron (Carbenin), MICs of panipenem (PAPM) against 1355 clinical isolates of 28 species from 15 medical institutions all over Japan from June 2000 to March 2001 were measured using the broth microdilution method approved by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and compared with those of parenteral carbapenem antibacterials, imipenem (IPM) and meropenem (MEPM), and parenteral cephem antibacterials, cefozopran, cefepime, and sulbactam/cefoperazone. The activity of PAPM was comparable to that of IPM against almost all species tested. Compared with MEPM, PAPM was more active against Gram-positive bacteria and Bacteroides spp., and less active against Gram-negative bacteria. Compared with the parenteral cephems, PAPM was more active against most of species tested and its MIC ranges were narrower than those of the cephems as were those of other carbapenems. In this surveillance study, the incidence of resistance in various species were as follows: 39.3% for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 47.3% for penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP), 15.1% for penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), 0.9% for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli, 3.4% for ESBL producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, 19.2% for beta-lactamase producing Haemophilus influenzae, 24.0% for beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) H. influenzae, and 1.0% for metallo-beta-lactamase producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against these resistant strains, carbapenems including PAPM showed generally more potent activity than cephems. It was noted that PAPM showed the most potent activity against PISP and PRSP, which showed high incidence of 62.4% totally, among tested drugs. Metallo-beta-lactamase producing P. aeruginosa exhibited high resistance and BLNAR H. influenzae also exhibited low susceptibility against all tested drugs. But no remarkable change in the activity of PAPM against other species was observed in this study compared with that in the studies before the marketing of Carbenin. Furthermore, it is necessary to pay much attention to the trend of resistant strains such as PRSP, metallo-beta-lactamase producing bacteria, and BLNAR H. influenzae.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of gatifloxacin against various fresh clinical isolates in 2002].
AB  - Antibacterial activities of gatifloxacin (GFLX) and other antibacterial drugs against various fresh clinical strains (800 isolates) isolated from specimens of patients in 2002 were compared. GFLX was more active than levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria such as methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. For these isolates, clarithromycin and azithromycin were less active (MIC90; > 16- > 64 micrograms/mL), GFLX was more active than cefdinir. For Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter species, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, three quinolones including GFLX were potently active (MIC90; < or = 0.06-0.5 microgram/mL). Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from urinary tract infections were resistant to three quinolones including GFLX (MIC90; 32-64 micrograms/mL), however P. aeruginosa isolated from respiratory and otolaryngological infections were more susceptible (MIC90; 0.5-2 micrograms/mL). Quinolones were less active against Neisseria gonorrhoeae as compared with the cephem antibiotics tested, but GFLX was the most active against N. gonorrhoeae among the quinolones tested. In this study, we investigated activity of GFLX against fresh clinical strains isolated early in 2002, GFLX is widely and potently active against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae and various Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Vitreous and aqueous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous and aqueous humor after oral administration. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized study of 24 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy between September 2001 and May 2002 at the Cullen Eye Institute. Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 24 patients after administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before the operation. Assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean +/- SD gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 23), vitreous (n = 23), and aqueous (n = 11) were 5.14 +/- 1.36 micro g/mL, 1.34 +/- 0.34 micro g/mL, and 1.08 +/- 0.54 micro g/mL respectively. Mean +/- SD sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 3.2 +/- 1.0 hours, 4.0 +/- 1.0 hours, and 3.9 +/- 1.1 hours, respectively. The percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 26.17% and 21.02%, respectively. Mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous MIC(90 ) levels were achieved against many pathogens, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Orally administered gatifloxacin achieves therapeutic levels in the noninflamed human eye, and the activity spectrum appropriately encompass the bacterial species most frequently involved in the various causes of endophthalmitis. Because of its broad-spectrum coverage, low MIC(90) levels for the organisms of concern, and good tolerability, gatifloxacin represents a major advance in the prophylaxis or treatment of postoperative, posttraumatic, and bleb-associated bacterial endophthalmitis.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a chimeric enzyme from Haemophilus influenzae Rd that exhibits glutathione-dependent peroxidase activity.
AB  - While belonging to the same family of antioxidant enzymes, members of the peroxiredoxins do not necessarily employ one and the same method for their reduction. Most representatives become reduced with the aid of thioredoxin, whereas some members use AhpF, tryparedoxin, or cyclophilin A. Recent research on a new peroxiredoxin isoform (type C) from Populus trichocarpa has shown that these particular types may also use glutaredoxin instead of thioredoxin. This finding is supported by the occurrence of chimeric proteins composed of a peroxiredoxin and glutaredoxin region. A gene encoding such a fusion protein is enclosed in the Haemophilus influenzae Rd genome. We expressed the H. influenzae protein, denoted here as PGdx, in Escherichia coli and purified the recombinant enzyme. In vitro assays demonstrate that PGdx, in the presence of dithiothreitol or glutathione, is able to protect supercoiled DNA against the metal ion-catalyzed oxidation-system. Enzymatic assays did, indeed, characterize PGdx as a peroxidase, requiring the glutathione redox cycle for the reduction of hydrogen peroxide (k(cat)/K(m) 5.01 x 10(6) s(-1) m(-1)) as well as the small organic hydroperoxide tert-butylhydroperoxide (k(cat)/K(m) 5.67 x 10(4) s(-1) m(-1)). Enzymatic activity as function of the glutathione concentration deviated from normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics, giving a sigmoidal pattern with an apparent Hill coefficient of 2.9. Besides the formation of a disulfide-linked PGdx dimer, it was also shown by mass spectrometric analysis that cysteine 49, which is equivalent to the active site cysteine of the peroxiredoxins, undergoes glutathionylation during purification under nonreducing conditions. Based on these results, we propose a model for the catalytic mechanism.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase productivity of recent clinical  isolates during the period between December 1999 and February 2000].
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility testings of 24 antimicrobial agents against 605 clinical strains belonging to 10 species were carried out according to the micro-broth dilution method of NCCLS M7-A4. The productivity of beta-lactamase was also determined against them isolated at 8 medical facilities in Nagano prefecture, Japan during the period between December 1999 and February 2000. When applied the nitrocefin method, beta-lactamase productivity was demonstrated to be positive for 89.2% of 74 S. aureus, 4.3% of 94 H. influenzae, and 100% of 69 M. (B.) catarrhalis isolates. On the other hand, when used the acidometry method, penicillinase/cephalosporinase were found to be positive for 21.2%/9.6% of 52 E. coli, 29.0%/3.2% of 31 K. pneumoniae, 53.2%/100% of 47 E. cloacae, 0%/11.1% of 99 S. marcescens, and 25.9%/55.6% of 54 P. aeruginosa isolates, respectively. Among the beta-lactamase-producers including P. aeruginosa isolates, only 2 E. coli isolates were found to be ESBL-producers. Besides, 9.6% (9/94) of H. influenzae isolates were proved to be BLNAR strains.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and prevalence of beta-lactamase producing clinical isolates in southern Kyushu. The results of collaborative study from 1999 to 2000].
AB  - The positivity of beta-lactamase and antimicrobial susceptibility were determined in a total of 1,358 clinical isolates at 15 hospitals and clinics in four prefectures in southern Kyushu (Okinawa, Miyazaki, Kagoshima and Kumamoto) during the period from December 1999 to February 2000. The isolates collected comprised of 176 strains of S. aureus, 203 of H. influenzae, 102 of M. catarrhalis, 206 of E. coli, 153 of K. pneumoniae, 99 of E. cloacae, 95 of S. marcescens, 201 of P. aeruginosa, 79 of E. faecalis, and 44 of E. faecium. The frequency of CPDX resistance among E. coli in particular varied geographically, and was found to be higher in Kumamoto and Kagoshima. The strains of K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae resistant to common antimicrobial agents were particularly found in Kagoshima, and one strain of IPM-resistant E. cloacae was isolated in Miyazaki. Also, the geographical difference in the frequency of LVFX resistance among the isolates of E. cloacae was noted, the results indicating the higher prevalence in Okinawa and Kagoshima. Resistant isolates of P. aeruginosa were less common in Kagoshima, and four isolates of P. aeruginosa from Miyazaki were found to be resistant to CAZ and IPM. None of the isolates of S. aureus and Enterococcus spp. was resistant to VCM or TEIC at all. The isolates of E. faecalis resistant at high-level GM (500 micrograms/ml) and SM (1,000 micrograms/ml) were found in 27.8% and 22.8%, and those of E. faecium were 6.8% and 38.6%, respectively. Overall, the ratio of MRSA among S. aureus was 67.6%, and three isolates were resistant to ABK with no less than 8 micrograms/ml of MIC. The frequency of BLNAR (beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin resistant) among H. influenzae isolated in Okinawa was markedly higher (isolation ratio, 37.9%) when compared with other prefectures, and the isolates of BLPACR (beta-lactamase-positive, AMPC/CVA resistant) were found only in Okinawa with a ratio of 41.6%. A total of 18 strains of ESBL defined by the NCCLS criteria (M100-S11) were isolated, eight strains of K. pneumoniae and 10 strains of E. coli. Of 18 isolates of ESBL, 13 were from Kagoshima and the remaining five were from Kumamoto.
TI  - [Drug sensitivity and beta-lactamase producibility of various types of bacteria clinically isolated during the period from December 1999 to February 2000].
AB  - beta-Lactamase activity and drug sensitivity were measured in 744 strains from 8  species of bacteria isolated at medical institutions in Chikugo District of Fukuoka Prefecture during the period from December 1999 to February 2000. Nitrocefin test revealed that beta-lactamase was positive in 48% of S. aureus, 7% of H. influenzae, and 92% of M. catarrhalis, and acidometry revealed that penicillinase/cephalosporinase were positive in 13%/14% of E. coli, 22%/8% of K. pneumoniae, 47%/97% of E. cloacae, 3%/65% of S. marcescens, and 10%/36% of P. aeruginosa. Based on the assessment of the MIC values of various types of antibacterial drugs for beta-lactamase-producing strains, there were 11 strains (1 strain of K. pneumonia, 6 strains of E. cloacae, and 4 strains of P. aeruginosa) of class-B beta-lactamase-producing bacteria out of a total of 496 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The results of PCR analysis suggested that 1 strain of K. pneumonia, 1 strain of E. cloacae, and 4 strains of P. aeruginosa produced metallo-beta-lactamase. There was no strain (E. coli and K. pneumoniae) of ESBL-producing bacteria. BLNAR strains, on the other hand, were found in 9% (9/100) of H. influenzae.
TI  - [Beta-lactamase activity and susceptibilities to antibiotics among some species of bacteria isolated from medical institution between December 1999 and February 2000].
AB  - We studied the beta-lactamase activity and susceptibilities to antibiotics in 604 strains among 10 species of bacteria isolated from 10 medical institutions in Tottori and Shimane Prefectures between December 1999 and February 2000. beta-Lactamase activity was measured by the nitrocefin test and penicillinase/cephalosporinase activities were measured by acidometry. beta-Lactamase activity was detected in 72.1% of S. aureus, 18.8% of H. influenzae, and 96.3% of M. catarrhalis. Penicillinase/cephalosporinase activities were detected in 17.8%/22.2% of E. coli, 9.7%/0.0% of K. pneumoniae, 18.6%/95.3% of E. cloacae, 12.7%/79.4% of S. marcescens, and 7.1%/31.8% of P. aeruginosa. Three of 72 strains (4.2%) of K. pneumoniae and 5 of 90 strains (5.6%) of E. coli were assessed as ESBL-producing bacteria using the NCCLS proposed screening method based on routine susceptibility testing results. BLNAR were detected in 13 of 69 strains (18.8%) of H. influenzae.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase types among clinical isolates during January and February 2000 in the Kinki area of Japan].
AB  - We studied antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase types among clinical isolates in the Kinki area of Japan. Eight hundreds isolates of eight organisms were collected by seven medical institutions during January and February 2000. The rates of beta-lactamase producing by using the chromogenic nitrocephin test were 68.0% against Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 6.0% against Haemophilus influenzae isolates, 98.0% against Moraxella catarrhalis isolates. The rate of beta-lactamase negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae was 4.0% (4 out of 100). The result of beta-lactamase producing by using the acid-metric method were as follows the penicillinase and cephalosporinase: 27.0% and 37.0% against Escherichia coli isolates, 37.0% and 1.0% against Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 21.8% and 100% against Enterobacter cloacae isolates, 24.2% and 96.0% against Serratia marcescens isolates, 7.0% and 22.0% against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. We identified beta-lactamase type of each isolate detected by polymerase chain reaction: SHV-derived extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBLs) (1 isolate of E. coli and 1 isolate of K. pneumoniae), CTX-M-1-derived ESBLs (1 isolate of K. pneumoniae, 1 of E. cloacae and 4 of S. marcescens), and IMP-1-derived metallo beta-lactamases (2 isolates of S. marcescens).
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase producibility of bacteria clinically isolated during the period from December 1999 to February 2000].
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase producibility were tested in 848  clinical strains collected at 8 hospitals in Kanagawa prefecture during the period from December 1999 to February 2000. Positive rates of beta-lactamase used the nitrocefin method (Cefinase) were 21.9% of Staphylococcus aureus, 10.0% of Haemophilus influenzae, and 99.0% of Moraxella catarrhalis. Furthermore, on the acidometric method (P/Case test) penicillinase (PCase), cephalosporinase (CEPase), and both of PCase and CEPase were found to be positive in 19.0%, 16.0%, and 16.0% for Escherichia coli, 6.2/0/3.1% for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0/66.3/26.5% for Enterobacter cloacae, 2.8/57.7/15.5% for Serratia marcescens, and 4.0/15.0/22.0% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. Based on the assessment of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antibacterial agents among beta-lactamase producing strains, there were 5 strains (4 strains of K. pneumoniae and 1 strain of E. coli) that may be ESBLs producing bacteria out of a total of 466 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. During this process, 1 strain of class-B beta-lactamase-producing E. cloacae was isolated. MRSA were found in 79.2% of S. aureus, and BLNAR were found in 8.9% of H. influenzae.
TI  - [beta-lactamase-producing activity and antimicrobial susceptibility of major pathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical samples. Japan beta-lactamase Research Group].
AB  - beta-Lactamase production and susceptibility to an assortment of antimicrobial agents were examined in 9,483 strains of organisms isolated from clinical materials obtained from inpatients and outpatients at 104 institutions throughout Japan from December 1999 to February 2000. The organisms were Staphylococcus aureus, 1,369 strains, including 847 methicillin-resistant (MRSA) strains; Enterococcus faecalis, 735 strains; Enterococcus faecium, 302 strains; Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, 730 strains; Haemophilus influenzae, 1,142 strains; Escherichia coli, 1,276 strains; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1,058 strains; Enterobacter cloacae, 772 strains; Serratia marcescens, 847 strains; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1,252 strains. The 23 antimicrobial agents used were ampicillin, sulbactam/ampicillin, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin, oxacillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotiam, cefmetazole, cefoperazone, sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpodoxime, imipenem, gentamicin, arbekacin, clarithromycin, minocycline, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, teicoplanin, and levofloxacin. Antimicrobial agents appropriate for each organism were used. Among S. aureus strains, 61.9% were MRSA, and 62.3% were positive for beta-lactamase. Among the MRSA strains, none was resistant to vancomycin or teicoplanin, and only 3% were resistant to arbekacin. There was no vancomycin resistance in the Enterococcus strains. Only 0.1% of E. faecalis strains were ampicillin-resistant. Among the M. catarrhalis strains, 97.5% produced beta-lactamase, while among the H. influenzae strains, 8.5% produced beta-lactamase and 14.5% were beta-lactamase-negative and ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR). Among the Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa strains, there were 20 (E. coli; 7/1,276, K. pneumoniae; 13/1,058) that produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), and 11 that produced class B beta-lactamases. Multiple drug resistance was advanced in every species, and organisms resistant to 7 or more common antimicrobial agents were isolated. The best combination of antimicrobial agent and beta-lactamase inhibitor was sulbactam/cefoperazone. Sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefepime, and imipenem still have excellent antimicrobial activity. Rates of resistance to each antimicrobial agent differed more among institutions than among geographical regions.
TI  - Exogenous glutathione completes the defense against oxidative stress in Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Since they are equipped with several strategies by which they evade the antimicrobial defense of host macrophages, it is surprising that members of the genus Haemophilus appear to be deficient in common antioxidant systems that are well established to protect prokaryotes against oxidative stress. Among others, no genetic evidence for glutathione (gamma-Glu-Cys-Gly) (GSH) biosynthesis or for alkyl hydroperoxide reduction (e.g., the Ahp system characteristic or enteric bacteria) is apparent from the Haemophilus influenzae Rd genome sequence, suggesting that the organism relies on alternative systems to maintain redox homeostasis or to reduce small alkyl hydroperoxides. In this report we address this apparent paradox for the nontypeable H. influenzae type strain NCTC 8143. Instead of biosynthesis, we could show that this strain acquires GSH by importing the thiol tripeptide from the growth medium. Although such GSH accumulation had no effect on growth rates, the presence of cellular GSH protected against methylglyoxal, tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH), and S-nitrosoglutathione toxicity and regulated the activity of certain antioxidant enzymes. H. influenzae NCTC 8143 extracts were shown to contain GSH-dependent peroxidase activity with t-BuOOH as the peroxide substrate. The GSH-mediated protection against t-BuOOH stress is most probably catalyzed by the product of open reading frame HI0572 (Prx/Grx), which we isolated from a genomic DNA fragment that confers wild-type resistance to t-BuOOH toxicity in the Ahp-negative Escherichia coli strain TA4315 and that introduces GSH-dependent alkyl hydroperoxide reductase activity into naturally GSH peroxidase-negative E. coli. Finally, we demonstrated that cysteine is an essential amino acid for growth and that cystine, GSH, glutathione amide, and cysteinylglycine can be catabolized in order to complement cysteine deficiency.
TI  - In vitro activity of thiamphenicol against multiresistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus in Italy.
AB  - Thiamphenicol is a derivative of chloramphenicol characterized by a spectrum comparable to that of the parent compound against multiresistant pathogens but showing satisfactory tolerability. The in vitro activity of thiamphenicol and of 11 comparative drugs against 397 recently isolated antibiotic-resistant and/or invasive pneumococci and 52 multiply-resistant MRSA including 2 VISA strains was determined. Bactericidal activity against Haemophilus influenzae and the post-antibiotic effect on Streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were also assessed. Against invasive pneumococci, thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol were the most potent non-beta-lactam molecules together with vancomycin and rifampin. Against high-level penicillin-resistant strains phenicol activities were superior to those of cefotaxime, ceftriaxone and imipenem. Against MRSA thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol were second only to the glycopetides and also inhibited the VISA strains. Thiamphenicol showed a significant PAE (0.33 to 2.9h) on all pathogens studied and a powerful bactericidal effect against beta-lactamase-positive and -negative H. influenzae. These results indicate a good in vitro activity of thiamphenicol against difficult-to-treat multiply resistant pathogens.
TI  - A catalytic mechanism for D-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase based on the crystal structure  of Hemophilus influenzae HI0670.
AB  - D-Tyr-tRNA(Tyr) deacylase is an editing enzyme that removes d-tyrosine and other  d-amino acids from charged tRNAs, thereby preventing incorrect incorporation of d-amino acids into proteins. A model for the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme is proposed based on the crystal structure of the enzyme from Haemophilus influenzae determined at a 1.64-A resolution. Structural comparison of this dimeric enzyme with the very similar structure of the enzyme from Escherichia coli together with sequence analyses indicate that the active site is located in the dimer interface within a depression that includes an invariant threonine residue, Thr-80. The active site contains an oxyanion hole formed by the main chain nitrogen atoms of Thr-80 and Phe-79 and the side chain amide group of the invariant Gln-78. The Michaelis complex between the enzyme and D-Tyr-tRNA was modeled assuming a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of D-Tyr by the Thr-80 O(gamma) atom and a role for the oxyanion hole in stabilizing the negatively charged tetrahedral transition states. The model is consistent with all of the available data on substrate specificity. Based on this model, we propose a substrate-assisted acylation/deacylation-catalytic mechanism in which the amino group of the D-Tyr is deprotonated and serves as the general base.
TI  - Minimal model for genome evolution and growth.
AB  - Textual analysis of typical microbial genomes reveals that they have the statistical characteristics of a DNA sequence of a much shorter length. This peculiar property supports an evolutionary model in which a genome evolves by random mutation but primarily grows by random segmental duplication. That genomes grew mostly by duplication is consistent with the observation that repeat sequences in all genomes are widespread and intragenomic and intergenomic homologous genes are preponderant across all life forms.
TI  - Vitreous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous humor after oral administration. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized clinical study of 20 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy surgery between September 2001 and February 2002 at the Cullen Eye Institute, Houston, Texas. Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 20 patients after oral administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before surgery. Assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 19), vitreous (n = 19), and aqueous (n = 10) 4.98 +/- 1.14 micrograms/mL, 1.35 +/- 0.36 microgram/mL, and 1.09 +/- 0.57 micrograms/mL, respectively. Mean sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 2.99 +/- 0.73 hours, 3.79 +/- 0.81 hours, and 3.71 +/- 0.87 hours, respectively. The percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 27.13% and 21.85%, respectively. Mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous MIC90 levels were achieved against a wide spectrum of pathogens, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Gatifloxacin is a novel fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic that has MIC90 levels significantly lower than those of other fluoroquinolone agents. Furthermore, it penetrates well into the vitreous cavity in the noninflamed eye. Potential uses for oral gatifloxacin may include prophylaxis against endophthalmitis in open-globe injuries, surgical prophylaxis against postoperative endophthalmitis, and adjunctive therapy for the current management of bacterial endophthalmitis.
TI  - Acute bacterial suppurative parotitis: microbiology and management.
AB  - The parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. The most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial parotitis are Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. The predominant anaerobes include gram-negative bacilli (including pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp.), Fusobacterium spp., and Peptostreptococcus spp. Streptococcus spp. (including S. pneumoniae) and gram-negative bacilli (including Escherichia coli) have also been reported. Gram-negative organisms are often seen in hospitalized patients. Organisms less frequently found are Arachnia, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Treponema pallidum, cat-scratch bacillus, and Eikenella corrodens. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of parotitis. Therapy includes maintenance of hydration and administration of parenteral antimicrobial therapy. Once an abscess has formed surgical drainage is required. The choice of antimicrobial depends on the etiologic agent. Maintenance of good oral hygiene, adequate hydration, and early and proper therapy of bacterial infection of the oropharynx may reduce the occurrence of suppurative parotitis.
TI  - Structural variation and inhibitor binding in polypeptide deformylase from four different bacterial species.
AB  - Polypeptide deformylase (PDF) catalyzes the deformylation of polypeptide chains in bacteria. It is essential for bacterial cell viability and is a potential antibacterial drug target. Here, we report the crystal structures of polypeptide deformylase from four different species of bacteria: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Escherichia coli. Comparison of these four structures reveals significant overall differences between the two Gram-negative species (E. coli and H. influenzae) and the two Gram-positive species (S. pneumoniae and S. aureus). Despite these differences and low overall sequence identity, the S1' pocket of PDF is well conserved among the four enzymes studied. We also describe the binding of nonpeptidic inhibitor molecules SB-485345, SB-543668, and SB-505684 to both S. pneumoniae and E. coli PDF. Comparison of these structures shows similar binding interactions with both Gram-negative and Gram-positive species. Understanding the similarities and subtle differences in active site structure between species will help to design broad-spectrum polypeptide deformylase inhibitor molecules.
TI  - Crystal structure of a trimeric form of dephosphocoenzyme A kinase from Escherichia coli.
AB  - Coenzyme A (CoA) is an essential cofactor used in a wide variety of biochemical pathways. The final step in the biosynthesis of CoA is catalyzed by dephosphocoenzyme A kinase (DPCK, E.C. 2.7.1.24). Here we report the crystal structure of DPCK from Escherichia coli at 1.8 A resolution. This enzyme forms a tightly packed trimer in its crystal state, in contrast to its observed monomeric structure in solution and to the monomeric, homologous DPCK structure from Haemophilus influenzae. We have confirmed the existence of the trimeric form of the enzyme in solution using gel filtration chromatography measurements. Dephospho-CoA kinase is structurally similar to many nucleoside kinases and other P-loop-containing nucleotide triphosphate hydrolases, despite having negligible sequence similarity to these enzymes. Each monomer consists of five parallel beta-strands flanked by alpha-helices, with an ATP-binding site formed by a P-loop motif. Orthologs of the E. coli DPCK sequence exist in a wide range of organisms, including humans. Multiple alignment of orthologous DPCK sequences reveals a set of highly conserved residues in the vicinity of the nucleotide/CoA binding site.
TI  - A generalized global alignment algorithm.
AB  - MOTIVATION: Homologous sequences are sometimes similar over some regions but different over other regions. Homologous sequences have a much lower global similarity if the different regions are much longer than the similar regions. RESULTS: We present a generalized global alignment algorithm for comparing sequences with intermittent similarities, an ordered list of similar regions separated by different regions. A generalized global alignment model is defined to handle sequences with intermittent similarities. A dynamic programming algorithm is designed to compute an optimal general alignment in time proportional to the product of sequence lengths and in space proportional to the sum of sequence lengths. The algorithm is implemented as a computer program named GAP3 (Global Alignment Program Version 3). The generalized global alignment model is validated by experimental results produced with GAP3 on both DNA and protein sequences.

TI  - Development of novel antibacterial peptides that kill resistant isolates.
AB  - The rapid emergence of bacterial strains that are resistant to current antibiotics requires the development of novel types of antimicrobial compounds. Proline-rich cationic antibacterial peptides such as pyrrhocoricin kill responsive bacteria by binding to the 70 kDa heat shock protein DnaK and inhibiting protein folding. We designed and synthesized multiply protected dimeric analogs of pyrrhocoricin and optimized the in vitro antibacterial efficacy assays for peptide antibiotics. Pyrrhocoricin and the designed dimers killed beta-lactam, tetracycline- or aminoglycoside-resistant strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis in the submicromolar or low micromolar concentration range. One of the peptides also killed Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The designed dimers showed improved stability in mammalian sera compared to the native analog. In a murine H. influenzae lung infection model, a single dose of a dimeric pyrrhocoricin analog reduced the bacteria in the bronchoalveolar lavage when delivered intranasally. The solid-phase synthesis was optimized for large-scale laboratory preparations.
TI  - High resolution structure of an alternate form of the ferric ion binding protein  from Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The periplasmic iron binding protein of pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria performs an essential role in iron acquisition from transferrin and other iron sources. Structural analysis of this protein from Haemophilus influenzae identified four amino acids that ligand the bound iron: His(9), Glu(57), Tyr(195), and Tyr(196). A phosphate provides an additional ligand, and the presence of a water molecule is required to complete the octahedral geometry for stable iron binding. We report the 1.14-A resolution crystal structure of the iron-loaded form of the H. influenzae periplasmic ferric ion binding protein (FbpA) mutant H9Q. This protein was produced in the periplasm of Escherichia coli and, after purification and conversion to the apo form, was iron-loaded. H9Q is able to bind ferric iron in an open conformation. A surprising finding in the present high resolution structure is the presence of EDTA located at the previously determined anion ternary binding site, where phosphate is located in the wild type holo and apo structures. EDTA contributes four of the six coordinating ligands for iron, with two Tyr residues, 195 and 196, completing the coordination. This is the first example of a metal binding protein with a bound metal.EDTA complex. The results suggest that FbpA may have the ability to bind and transport iron bound to biological chelators, in addition to bare ferric iron.
TI  - Do HIV-seropositive patients become colonised with drug-resistant microorganisms?
AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate whether HIV-infected patients, a  group that is supposedly at risk for infection with antibiotic-resistant microbes, really does so, and to assess possible risk factors for acquiring these organisms. During the period from January 1998 to July 1999, samples of normal flora were obtained from 107 HIV-infected patients attending an outpatient clinic in Oslo, Norway. The samples were cultured for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Candida spp., and the resulting isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. The patients studied represented all stages of HIV infection, from recently infected to severely immunocompromised. Samples were taken at one, two or three time-points to determine whether antimicrobial resistance in colonising microorganisms increases over time. Antimicrobial resistance was linked primarily to antimicrobial prophylaxis, but it did not increase during the observation period. The level of a patient's immunodeficiency and the consequently intensified medical care was also of some importance. Even though about 50% of the patients were receiving antimicrobial agents at the time of sampling, the level of resistance found in these patients was very similar to that found in other patient groups in Norway; except for Candida albicans isolates, which were less susceptible to fluconazole. Overall, antimicrobial resistance was uncommon in the HIV-seropositive patients studied, a finding that is probably related to the overall low prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in the general population in Norway.
TI  - Evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  - The newly developed Rapid Lumi Eiken/IS60 (RL/IS60) system automatically determines MICs by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. The present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. Sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with MICs determined by the reference microdilution method. When the MICs of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (QC) strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the RL/IS60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the QC limits proposed by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The system was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, P. aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the RL/IS60 system and the reference microdilution method. Our results suggest that the RL/IS60 system provides rapid and reliable MICs of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as QC strains.
TI  - Solution structure and functional ligand screening of HI0719, a highly conserved  protein from bacteria to humans in the YjgF/YER057c/UK114 family.
AB  - HI0719 belongs to a large family of highly conserved proteins with no definitive  molecular function and is found in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. We describe the NMR structure of HI0719, the first solution structure for a member of this family. The overall fold is similar to the crystal structures of two homologues, YabJ from Bacillus subtilis and YjgF from Escherichia coli, and all three structures are similar to that of chorismate mutase, although there is little sequence homology and no apparent functional connection. HI0719 is a homotrimer with a distinct cavity located at the subunit interface. Six of the seven invariant residues in the high identity group of proteins are located in this cavity, suggesting that this may be a binding site for small molecules. Using previously published observations about the biological role of HI0719 family members as a guide, over 100 naturally occurring small molecules or structural analogues were screened for ligand binding using NMR spectroscopy. The targeted screening approach identified six compounds that bind to HI0719 at the putative active site. Five of these compounds are either alpha-keto acids or alpha,beta-unsaturated acids, while the sixth compound is structurally similar. Previous studies have proposed that some HI0719 homologues may act on small molecules in the isoleucine biosynthetic path and, if this is correct, the ligand screening results presented here suggest that the interaction most likely occurs with 2-ketobutyrate and/or its unstable enamine precursor.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray crystallographic analysis of tRNA(m1G37)methyltransferase from Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The enzyme tRNA(m(1)G37)methyltransferase (TrmD) catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) specifically to guanosine at position 37 within a subset of tRNA species in bacteria. The modified guanosine is next to the anticodon and is important for the maintenance of the correct reading frame during translation. TrmD from Haemophilus influenzae with both N- and C-terminal tags was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and crystallized at 297 K using sodium acetate as a precipitant. Native X-ray diffraction data were collected to 1.85 A resolution. The crystals are rhombohedral, belonging to the space group R32, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 98.05, c = 176.79 A, alpha = beta = 90, gamma = 120 degrees. The presence of one monomer of recombinant TrmD in the crystallographic asymmetric unit gives a V(M) of 3.07 A(3) Da(-1) and a solvent content of 59.9%.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray crystallographic studies of 3-deoxy-manno-octulosonate cytidylyltransferase from Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The enzyme 3-deoxy-manno-octulosonate cytidylyltransferase (CMP-KDO synthetase; CKS) catalyzes the activation of 3-deoxy-manno-octulosonate (KDO) by forming CMP-KDO. It is essential for the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharides in Gram-negative bacteria and is a potential target for the discovery of antibacterial agents. L-CKS from Haemophilus influenzae was overexpressed with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag in Escherichia coli and crystallized in the presence of the substrate KDO at 297 K using PEG 4000 as a precipitant and ethylene glycol as an additive. The diffraction limit and spot shape of the native crystal could be improved significantly by dehydration/annealing. X-ray diffraction data were collected to 2.5 A resolution from a native crystal. The crystals are orthorhombic, belonging to the space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 48.6, b = 83.1, c = 117.3 A. The presence of two monomers of recombinant L-CKS in the crystallographic asymmetric unit gives a reasonable V(M) of 2.05 A(3) Da(-1), with a solvent content of 40.0%.
TI  - Two-component systems in Haemophilus influenzae: a regulatory role for ArcA in serum resistance.
AB  - Knockout mutations were constructed in the arcA gene of a virulent type b strain  of Haemophilus influenzae, and the behavior of the resulting mutants was investigated in a number of conditions that mimicked distinct steps in the natural infection pathway. In arcA mutants, synthesis of capsule and lipooligosaccharide (LOS) and growth in synthetic media were unaltered compared to synthesis of capsule and LOS and growth in synthetic media in the wild-type H. influenzae type b parent strain. However, the virulence of the arcA mutants for BALB/c mice was significantly reduced. Upon exposure to human blood or serum, the arcA mutants showed markedly reduced survival compared with the survival of its wild-type parent. Serum resistance could be fully restored by complementation in cis with the H. influenzae arcA gene but not by complementation in cis with the homologous gene from Escherichia coli. The proteomes of wild-type and mutant bacteria were markedly different, especially under anaerobic conditions, underscoring the global regulatory role of ArcAB in H. influenzae. Evaluation of antibody titers and classical complement activities in various serum samples pointed to complement-mediated bactericidal activity as the factor that distinguishes between the arcA mutant and wild-type phenotypes. Comparative analysis of the membrane fractions of the arcA mutants and the wild-type strain revealed several ArcA-regulated proteins, some of which may be implicated in the serum hypersensitivity phenotype.
TI  - A multicenter comparative study of cefepime versus broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy in moderate and severe bacterial infections.
AB  - The safety and efficacy of cefepime empiric monotherapy compared with standard broad-spectrum combination therapy for hospitalized adult patients with moderate to severe community-acquired bacterial infections were evaluated. In an open-label, multicenter study, 317 patients with an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score ranging from >5 to =19 were enrolled with documented pneumonia (n=196), urinary tract infection (n=65), intra-abdominal infection (n=38), or sepsis (n=18). Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive cefepime 1 to 2 g IV twice daily or three times a day or IV ampicillin, cephalothin, or ceftriaxone +/-aminoglycoside therapy for 3 to 21 days. For both treatment groups, metronidazole, vancomycin, or macrolide therapy was added as deemed necessary. The primary efficacy variable was clinical response at the end of therapy. Two hundred ninety-six (93%) patients met evaluation criteria and were included in the efficacy analysis. Diagnoses included the following: 180 pneumonias (90 cefepime, 90 comparator), 62 urinary tract infections (29 cefepime, 33 comparator), 37 intra-abdominal infections (19 cefepime, 18 comparator), and 17 sepses (8 cefepime, 9 comparator). At the end of therapy, overall clinical success rates were 131/146 (90%) for patients treated with cefepime vs 125/150 (83%) for those treated with comparator (95% confidence interval [CI]: -2.6% to 16.3%). The clinical success rate for patients with community-acquired pneumonia, the most frequent infection, was 86% for both treatment groups. Among the patients clinically evaluated, 162 pathogens were isolated and identified before therapy. The most commonly isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli (n=49), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=29), Haemophilus influenzae (n=14), and Staphylococcus aureus (n=11). Bacteriologic eradication/presumed eradication was 97% for cefepime vs 94% for comparator-treated patients. Drug-related adverse events were reported in 16% of cefepime patients and 19% of comparator patients. In conclusion, cefepime had higher cure rates compared with broad-spectrum combination therapy as an initial empiric treatment for hospitalized patients with moderate to severe community-acquired infections, including urinary tract infections, intra-abdominal infections, and sepsis.
TI  - Role of RsmA in the regulation of swarming motility and virulence factor expression in Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Swarming by Proteus mirabilis involves differentiation of typical short vegetative rods into filamentous hyper-flagellated swarm cells that undergo cycles of rapid and co-ordinated population migration across surfaces and exhibit high levels of virulence gene expression. RsmA (repressor of secondary metabolites) and CsrA, its homologue in Escherichia coli, control many phenotypic traits, such as motility and pathogenesis in Erwinia species, glycogen biosynthesis, cell size and biofilm formation in Escherichia coli and swarming motility in Serratia marcescens. To investigate the role of RsmA in Proteus mirabilis, the rsmA gene from Proteus mirabilis (hereafter referred to as rsmA(Pm)) was cloned. RsmA(Pm) showed high sequence similarity to Escherichia coli CsrA and RsmA cloned from Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae and Bacillus subtilis and could complement an Escherichia coli csrA mutant in glycogen synthesis. A low-copy-number plasmid carrying rsmA(Pm) expressed from its native promoter caused suppression of swarming motility and expression of virulence factors in Proteus mirabilis. mRNA stability assays suggested that RsmA(Pm) inhibited virulence factor expression through promoting mRNA degradation. RsmA homologues cloned from Serratia marcescens and Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora could also inhibit swarming and virulence factor expression in Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - Identification of oligomerization and drug-binding domains of the membrane fusion protein EmrA.
AB  - Many pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria possess tripartite transporters that catalyze drug extrusion across the inner and outer membranes, thereby conferring resistance. These transporters consist of inner (IMP) and outer (OMP) membrane proteins, which are coupled by a periplasmic membrane fusion (MFP) protein. However, it is not know whether the MFP translocates the drug between the membranes, by acting as a channel, or whether it brings the IMP and OMP together, facilitating drug transfer. The MFP EmrA has an elongated periplasmic domain, which binds transported drugs, and is anchored to the inner membrane by a single alpha-helix, which contains a leucine zipper dimerization domain. Consistent with CD and hydrodynamic analyses, the periplasmic domain is predicted to be composed of a beta-sheet subdomain and an alpha-helical coiled-coil. We propose that EmrA forms a trimer in which the coiled-coils radiate across the periplasm, where they could sequester the OMP TolC. The "free" leucine zipper in the EmrA trimer might stabilize the interaction with the IMP EmrB, which also possesses leucine zipper motifs in the putative N- and C-terminal helices. The beta-sheet subdomain of EmrA would sit at the membrane surface adjacent to the EmrB, from which it receives the transported drug, inducing a conformational change that triggers the interaction with the OMP.
TI  - SecB, one small chaperone in the complex milieu of the cell.
AB  - SecB is only one of a plethora of cytosolic chaperones in E. coli whose common property is that they bind nonnative proteins. It plays a crucial role during protein export via the general secretory pathway by modulating the partitioning of precursors between folding or aggregation and delivery to the membrane-bound translocation apparatus. In this latter role SecB demonstrates specific binding to a unique partner, SecA. SecB has the potential to participate in functions outside of export acting as a general nonspecific chaperone to provide buffering capacity of the nonnative state of proteins in the cytosolic pool. We discuss the interactions of SecB with its many binding partners in light of its recently determined structure, emphasizing both kinetic and thermodynamic parameters.
TI  - Use of LexA-based system to identify protein-protein interactions in vivo.
AB  
TI  - Solution structure of the ribosome-associated cold shock response protein Yfia of Escherichia coli.
AB  - The solution structure of the ribosome-associated cold shock response protein Yfia of Escherichia coli was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance with a RMSD of 0.6A. Yfia shows a global beta-alpha-beta-beta-beta-alpha folding topology similar to its homologue HI0257 of Haemophilus influenzae and the double-strand-binding domain of Drosophila Staufen protein. Yfia and HI0257 differ in their surface charges and in the composition of their flexible C-termini, indicating their specificity to different target molecules. Both proteins exhibit a hydrophobic and polar region, which probably functions as interaction site for protein complex formation. Despite their similarity to the dsRBD fold, Yfia does not bind to model fragments of 16S ribosomal RNA as determined by NMR titration and gel shift experiments.
TI  - A strategy to retrieve the whole set of protein modules in microbial proteomes.
AB  - Protein homology is often limited to long structural segments that we have previously called modules. We describe here a suite of programs used to catalog the whole set of modules present in microbial proteomes. First, the Darwin AllAll program detects homologous segments using thresholds for evolutionary distance and alignment length, and another program classifies these modules. After assembling these homologous modules in families, we further group families which are related by a chain of neighboring unrelated homologous modules. With the automatic analysis of these groups of families sharing homologous modules in independent multimodular proteins, one can split into their component parts many fused modules and/or deduce by logic more distant modules. All detected and inferred modules are reassembled in refined families. These two last steps are made by a unique program. Eventually, the soundness of the data obtained by this experimental approach is checked using independent tests. To illustrate this modular approach, we compared four proteobacterial proteomes (Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Helicobacter pylori). It appears that this method might retrieve from present-day proteins many of the modules which can help to trace back ancient events of gene duplication and/or fusion.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of BAL9141, a novel parenteral cephalosporin active against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  - Community-acquired and nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens continue to increase in prevalence and have become a serious problem in many parts of the world. BAL9141 is a member of the class of parenteral pyrrolidinone-3-ylidenemethyl cephalosporins, and has a broad spectrum of activity. In the current study, BAL9141 was tested against a large number (n = 2263) of recent isolates from various international surveillance programmes including 1097 Gram-positive strains. Susceptibility to (S) and activity of (mg/L) to BAL9141, based on proposed breakpoints (MIC50/MIC90/% S) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.5/0.5/100%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (1/2/100%), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (0.12/0.25/100%), methicillin-resistant CoNS (MR-CoNS) (1/2/100%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (< or = 0.015/0.25/100%), viridans group streptococci (0.03/0.5/99%), beta-haemolytic streptococci (< or = 0.015/< or = 0.015/100%), Enterococcus faecalis (0.5/16/90%), Enterococcus faecium (>32/>32/22%), Haemophilus influenzae (0.06/0.06/100%), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.06/0.5/100%), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (0.03/0.06/100%) and Neisseria meningitidis (< or = 0.002/0.004/100%). BAL9141 susceptibility at < pr = 4 mg/L (100% S) surpassed that of ceftriaxone (CRO; 1% S) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q-D; 92% S) against MRSA and MR-CoNS (CRO 0.9% S; Q-D 94% S). All S. pneumoniae were inhibited by BAL9141 at < or = 1 mg/L compared with CRO (90% S) and levofloxacin (LVX; 98% S). Susceptibility rates for viridans group streptococci to BAL9141 (>98%) were also higher than to CRO (86%) and LVX (96%). BAL9141 demonstrated excellent activity against most species of wild-type enteric bacilli, with > or = 95% of isolates being susceptible; however, only modest activity was observed for BAL9141 against non-fermentative Gram-negative species and ESBL-producing Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae. BAL9141 demonstrated excellent activity against many tested pathogens displaying various resistance phenotypes, and should be particularly valuable in the treatment of MRSA as well as for drug-resistant streptococci, while maintaining a spectrum resembling a 'third-generation' cephalosporin against other clinically important species.
TI  - Vaginal discharge due to undiagnosed bilateral duplicated collecting system with  ectopic ureters in a three-year-old female: an initial high index of suspicion for sexual abuse.
AB  - In prepubertal girls with vaginal discharge, consideration of the etiology must be given to respiratory pathogens (Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Neisseria meningitidis), enteric pathogens (Escherichia coli, Shigella, and Yersinia), poor hygiene, foreign body, nonabsorbent undergarments, irritants, vulvar skin disease, anatomic abnormalities (double vagina with fistula, pelvic abscess, and ectopic ureter), and sexual abuse. Prepubertal girls, outside the newborn period, with suspected gonococcal infection should be strongly considered to be victims of sexual abuse, once congenital and other newborn acquired forms of gonorrhea are excluded. We present a case of a three-year-old female with vaginal discharge and fever with a clouded social history, disproportionate distress on physical exam, and initial laboratory gram stain suggestive of gonococcus.
TI  - Bacteriology of acute and chronic sphenoid sinusitis.
AB  - Aspirates of 16 acutely infected and 7 chronically infected sphenoid sinuses were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 29 isolates were recovered from the 16 cases of acute sphenoid sinusitis (1.8 per specimen): 22 aerobic and facultative (1.4 per specimen), and 7 anaerobic (0.4 per specimen). Aerobic and facultative organisms alone were recovered in 10 specimens (62%), anaerobes alone were isolated in 3 (19%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were recovered in 3 (19%). The predominant aerobic and facultative species were Staphylococcus aureus (9 isolates), Streptococcus spp (9), and Haemophilus influenzae (2). A total of 28 isolates were recovered from the 7 cases of chronic sphenoid sinusitis (4.0 per specimen): 11 aerobic and facultative (1.6 per specimen) and 17 anaerobic (2.4 per specimen). Aerobic and facultative organisms alone were recovered in I instance (14%), anaerobes alone in 3 instances (43%), and mixed aerobes and anaerobes in 3 instances (43%). The predominant aerobic bacteria were gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 1 each). The predominant anaerobes included Peptostreptococcus spp (4 isolates), Prevotella spp (5), and Fusobacterium spp (4). These findings illustrate the unique microbiology of acute and chronic sphenoid sinusitis.
TI  - Ribosylnicotinamide kinase domain of NadR protein: identification and implications in NAD biosynthesis.
AB  - NAD is an indispensable redox cofactor in all organisms. Most of the genes required for NAD biosynthesis in various species are known. Ribosylnicotinamide kinase (RNK) was among the few unknown (missing) genes involved with NAD salvage and recycling pathways. Using a comparative genome analysis involving reconstruction of NAD metabolism from genomic data, we predicted and experimentally verified that bacterial RNK is encoded within the 3' region of the nadR gene. Based on these results and previous data, the full-size multifunctional NadR protein (as in Escherichia coli) is composed of (i) an N-terminal DNA-binding domain involved in the transcriptional regulation of NAD biosynthesis, (ii) a central nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) domain, and (iii) a C-terminal RNK domain. The RNK and NMNAT enzymatic activities of recombinant NadR proteins from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Haemophilus influenzae were quantitatively characterized. We propose a model for the complete salvage pathway from exogenous N-ribosylnicotinamide to NAD which involves the concerted action of the PnuC transporter and NRK, followed by the NMNAT activity of the NadR protein. Both the pnuC and nadR genes were proven to be essential for the growth and survival of H. influenzae, thus implicating them as potential narrow-spectrum drug targets.
TI  - Sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  - AIMS: To test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. METHODS: The bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 IU/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin B was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees C with five inocula of 14 bacteria. Two yeasts (Candida spp) and one Aspergillus were also tested. Contaminated media were then inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a Bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. Changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened daily by visual inspection. The sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. RESULTS: Organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria irrespective of the starting inoculums: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, and Haemophilus influenzae. For micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal only (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Candida kruzei, Aspergillus fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. Mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (SD 13.8, range 2-52). In cases of detection by the blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.
TI  - Bacteria classification using Cyranose 320 electronic nose.
AB  - BACKGROUND: An electronic nose (e-nose), the Cyrano Sciences' Cyranose 320, comprising an array of thirty-two polymer carbon black composite sensors has been used to identify six species of bacteria responsible for eye infections when present at a range of concentrations in saline solutions. Readings were taken from the headspace of the samples by manually introducing the portable e-nose system into a sterile glass containing a fixed volume of bacteria in suspension. Gathered data were a very complex mixture of different chemical compounds. METHOD: Linear Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method was able to classify four classes of bacteria out of six classes though in reality other two classes were not better evident from PCA analysis and we got 74% classification accuracy from PCA. An innovative data clustering approach was investigated for these bacteria data by combining the 3-dimensional scatter plot, Fuzzy C Means (FCM) and Self Organizing Map (SOM) network. Using these three data clustering algorithms simultaneously better 'classification' of six eye bacteria classes were represented. Then three supervised classifiers, namely Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), Probabilistic Neural network (PNN) and Radial basis function network (RBF), were used to classify the six bacteria classes. RESULTS: A [6 x 1] SOM network gave 96% accuracy for bacteria classification which was best accuracy. A comparative evaluation of the classifiers was conducted for this application. The best results suggest that we are able to predict six classes of bacteria with up to 98% accuracy with the application of the RBF network. CONCLUSION: This type of bacteria data analysis and feature extraction is very difficult. But we can conclude that this combined use of three nonlinear methods can solve the feature extraction problem with very complex data and enhance the performance of Cyranose 320.
TI  - [Surveillance for antimicrobial resistance: VIRA Study].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Resistance to antimicrobial drugs has increased in recent years. The aim of this multicenter study was to determine the current situation in Spain regarding the resistance patterns of the most common infectious agents to antimicrobial drugs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total 1,475 strains isolated in 38 hospitals in October 2001 were studied. These included 294 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 149 clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), 96 Enterococcus faecium, 1 ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, 204 penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100 ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, 361 ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli, 160 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 110 Acinetobacter baumannii. Sensitivity to various antibiotics was studied by a broth microdilution method. Additionally, an epidemiologic survey was conducted in the participating hospitals to determine the incidence of these multi-drug resistant microorganisms. RESULTS: Overall incidence of ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli and MRSA strains was 24% in both cases. The pneumococci were resistant to several antibiotics. Telithromycin showed excellent activity against all the pneumococci, including those resistant to macrolides. Most MRSA isolates were resistant to quinolones and macrolides. All the staphylococci were susceptible to linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin. Only 50% of A. baumannii strains were susceptible to imipenem. CONCLUSION: The results of this study evidence increasing multi-drug resistance among various microorganisms, such as MRSA, CNS, ampicillin-resistant enterococci, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci, and underline the need for surveillance programs to gain information on this significant therapeutic problem.
TI  - Donor substrate regeneration for efficient synthesis of globotetraose and isoglobotetraose.
AB  - Here we describe the efficient synthesis of two oligosaccharide moieties of human glycosphingolipids, globotetraose (GalNAcbeta1-->3Galalpha1-->4Galbeta1-->4Glc) and isoglobotetraose (GalNAcbeta1-->3Galalpha1-->3Galbeta1-->4Glc), with in situ enzymatic regeneration of UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine (UDP-GalNAc). We demonstrate that the recombinant beta-1,3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase from Haemophilus influenzae strain Rd can transfer N-acetylgalactosamine to a wide range of acceptor substrates with a terminal galactose residue. The donor substrate UDP-GalNAc can be regenerated by a six-enzyme reaction cycle consisting of phosphoglucosamine mutase, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase, phosphate acetyltransferase, pyruvate kinase, and inorganic pyrophosphatase from Escherichia coli, as well as UDP-N-acetylglucosamine C4 epimerase from Plesiomonas shigelloides. All these enzymes were overexpressed in E. coli with six-histidine tags and were purified by one-step nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. Multiple-enzyme synthesis of globotetraose or isoglobotetraose with the purified enzymes was achieved with relatively high yields.
TI  - Combinations of protein polysaccharide conjugate vaccines for intranasal immunization.
AB  - The ability of 2 mutants of heat-labile Escherichia coli enterotoxin (LTK63 and LTR72) to enhance the immunogenicity of 2 protein polysaccharide conjugate vaccines, Neisseria meningitidis group C (MenC) and Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), both of which are conjugated to the nontoxic mutant of diphtheria toxin (CRM197), after intranasal (inl) immunization in mice was evaluated. In addition, the question of whether combining both vaccines in a single formulation with heat-labile E. coli enterotoxin mutants reduced the response to either vaccine was investigated. The results showed that potent serum antibody responses against MenC and Hib could be elicited by inl immunization in combination with the mucosal adjuvants. Moreover, IgA mucosal responses were induced only in animals immunized through the inl route. Finally, the coadministration of 2 conjugate vaccines simultaneously did not adversely affect the responses against either. These studies support the rationale for developing mucosal vaccines, based on combining protein polysaccharide conjugates with heat-labile E. coli enterotoxin mutants, for infants and young children.
TI  - Ribosome-associated factor Y adopts a fold resembling a double-stranded RNA binding domain scaffold.
AB  - Escherichia coli protein Y (pY) binds to the small ribosomal subunit and stabilizes ribosomes against dissociation when bacteria experience environmental stress. pY inhibits translation in vitro, most probably by interfering with the binding of the aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosomal A site. Such a translational arrest may mediate overall adaptation of cells to environmental conditions. We have determined the 3D solution structure of a 112-residue pY and have studied its backbone dynamic by NMR spectroscopy. The structure has a betaalphabetabetabetaalpha topology and represents a compact two-layered sandwich of two nearly parallel alpha helices packed against the same side of a four-stranded beta sheet. The 23 C-terminal residues of the protein are disordered. Long-range angular constraints provided by residual dipolar coupling data proved critical for precisely defining the position of helix 1. Our data establish that the C-terminal region of helix 1 and the loop linking this helix with strand beta2 show significant conformational exchange in the ms- micro s time scale, which may have relevance to the interaction of pY with ribosomal subunits. Distribution of the conserved residues on the protein surface highlights a positively charged region towards the C-terminal segments of both alpha helices, which most probably constitutes an RNA binding site. The observed betaalphabetabetabetaalpha topology of pY resembles the alphabetabetabetaalpha topology of double-stranded RNA-binding domains, despite limited sequence similarity. It appears probable that functional properties of pY are not identical to those of dsRBDs, as the postulated RNA-binding site in pY does not coincide with the RNA-binding surface of the dsRBDs.
TI  - [Purine regulon of gamma-proteobacteria: a detailed description].
AB  - The structure of the purine regulon was studied by a comparative genomic approach in seven genomes of gamma-proteobacteria: Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Yersinia pestis, Haemophilus influenzae, Pasteurella multocida, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Vibrio cholerae. The palindromic binding site of the purine repressor (consensus ACGCAAACGTTTGCGT) is fairly well retained of genes encoding enzymes that participate in the synthesis of inosinemonophosphate from phosphoribozylpyrophosphate and in transfer of unicarbon groups, and also upstream of some transport protein genes. These genes may be regarded as the main part of the purine regulon. In terms of physiology, the regulation of the purC and gcvTHP/folD genes seems to be especially important, because the PurR site was found upstream of nonorthologous but functionally replaceable genes. However, the PurR site is poorly retained in front of orthologs of some genes belonging to the E. coli purine regulon, such as genes involved in general nitrogen metabolism, biosynthesis of pyrimidines, and synthesis of AMP and GMP from IMP, and also upstream of the purine repressor gene. It is predicted that purine regulons of the examined bacteria include the following genes: upp participating in synthesis of pyrimidines; uraA encoding an uracil transporter gene; serA involved in serine biosynthesis; folD responsible for the conversion of N5,N10-methenyl tetrahydrofolate into N10-formyltetrahydrofolate; rpiA involved in ribose metabolism; and protein genes with an unknown function (yhhQ and ydiK). The PurR site was shown to have different structure in different genomes. Thus, the tendency for a decline of the conservatism of site positions 2 and 15 was observed in genomes of bacteria belonging to the Pasteurellaceae and Vibrionaceae groups.
TI  - Moxifloxacin activity against clinical isolates compared with the activity of ciprofloxacin.
AB  - The activity of moxifloxacin, a new 8-methoxyquinolone, was compared in vitro with the activity of ciprofloxacin against clinical strains isolated from various sites of infection. The mode MIC values of moxifloxacin were superior to those of ciprofloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter spp., while ciprofloxacin was more active against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas spp. Both antibiotics had similar activity against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Enterobacter spp.
TI  - Structural and nucleotide-binding properties of YajQ and YnaF, two Escherichia coli proteins of unknown function.
AB  - Structural genomics is a new approach in functional assignment of proteins identified via whole-genome sequencing programs. Its rationale is that nonhomologous proteins performing similar or related biological functions might have similar tertiary structure. We used dye pseudoaffinity chromatography, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry to identify two novel Escherichia coli nucleotide-binding proteins, YnaF and YajQ. YnaF exhibited significant sequence identity with MJ0577, an ATP-binding protein from a hyperthermophile (Methanococcus jannaschii), and with UspA, a protein from Haemophilus influenzae that belongs to the Universal Stress Protein family. YnaF conserves the ATP-binding site and the dimeric structure observed in the crystal of MJ0577. The protein YajQ, present in many bacterial genomes, is missing in eukaryotes. In the absence of significant similarities of YajQ to any solved structure, we determined its structural and ligand-binding properties by NMR and isothermal titration calorimetry. We demonstrate that YajQ is composed of two domains, each centered on a beta-sheet, that are connected by two helical segments. NMR studies, corroborated with local sequence conservation among YajQ homologs in various bacteria, indicate that one of the beta-sheets is mostly involved in biological activity.
TI  - [In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of pazufloxacin mesilate, a new injectable quinolone].
AB  - We investigated the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of pazufloxacin mesilate (PZFX mesilate), a new injectable quinolone, and obtained the following results. 1) The MIC50 and MIC90 values of PZFX against clinically isolated Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, ranged from 0.0125 to 12.5 micrograms/ml and 0.025 to 100 micrograms/ml, respectively. PZFX showed broad spectrum activity. The antibacterial activities of PZFX against quinolone-susceptible, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, extended spectrum beta-lactamase possessing Klebsiella pneumoniae and imipenem/cilastatine (IPM/CS)-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa were superior to those of ceftazidime (CAZ), ceftriaxone, IPM/CS, meropenem and panipenem/betamipron. 2) PZFX showed superior bactericidal activity against S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens and P. aeruginosa to those of CAZ and IPM/CS after treatment for 15 minutes at the drug concentration equivalent to that in human serum at clinical dose to be continued for 15 minutes. 3) CAZ and IPM/CS had no bactericidal activity at the 16 times of MIC against P. aeruginosa in human polymorphonuclear leucocytes, while PZFX exhibited potent bactericidal activity in a dose-dependent manner against such bacteria. 4) PZFX inhibited both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV from S. aureus at nearly the same level. PZFX showed poor inhibitory activity against topoisomerase II from human placenta and showed high selectivity to bacterial topoisomerase. 5) PZFX mesilate showed superior therapeutic activity to that of CAZ with following infection model caused by S. aureus and P. aeruginosa or each; systemic infection with cyclophosphamide-treated mice, systemic infection in mice with high challenge doses, CMC pouch infection in rat, and calculus infection in rat bladder. 6) Intravenous administration of PZFX with high plasma concentration just after administration, showed more excellent therapeutic effect against the rat intraperitoneal infection, than p.o. and s.c. administration.
TI  - Escherichia coli DegP protease cleaves between paired hydrophobic residues in a natural substrate: the PapA pilin.
AB  - The DegP protein, a multifunctional chaperone and protease, is essential for clearance of denatured or aggregated proteins from the inner-membrane and periplasmic space in Escherichia coli. To date, four natural targets for DegP have been described: colicin A lysis protein, pilin subunits and MalS from E. coli, and high-molecular-weight adherence proteins from Haemophilus influenzae. In vitro, DegP has shown weak protease activity with casein and several other nonnative substrates. We report here the identification of the major pilin subunit of the Pap pilus, PapA, as a natural DegP substrate and demonstrate binding and proteolysis of this substrate in vitro. Using overlapping peptide arrays, we identified three regions in PapA that are preferentially cleaved by DegP. A 7-mer peptide was found to be a suitable substrate for cleavage by DegP in vitro. In vitro proteolysis of model peptide substrates revealed that cleavage is dependent upon the presence of paired hydrophobic amino acids; moreover, cleavage was found to occur between the hydrophobic residues. Finally, we demonstrate that the conserved carboxyl-terminal sequence in pilin subunits, although not a cleavage substrate for DegP, activates the protease and we propose that the activating peptide is recognized by DegP's PDZ domains.
TI  - Altered channel properties of porins from Haemophilus influenzae: isolates from cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  - Changes in amino-acid sequence of the unique pore-forming protein of H. influenzae (OmpP2; porin) have been associated with increased antimicrobial resistance in H. influenzae strains isolated from cystic fibrosis patients. From patients who were subjected to long-term antimicrobial therapy, H. influenzae strains 67d and 69a (patient 27) and strains 77a and 77f (patient 30) were isolated. Strains 67d and 77a were previously shown to have elevated values for minimal inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics compared to strains 69a and 77f. Porins were extracted from all four H. influenzae strains by detergent treatment and purified to homogeneity by ion exchange chromatography. By reconstitution of the clinical Hi porins into planar lipid bilayers, single-channel conductance, ionic selectivity, and voltage-gating characteristics were assessed. Porins 77a and 77f displayed similar single-channel conductance and ionic selectivity. Current-voltage relationships were determined for the different porins: porin 77f displayed substantial voltage gating at both positive and negative polarity; porin 77a gated at negative polarity only. Porins 67d and 69a showed substantial differences in their pore-forming properties: the single-channel conductance of porin 69a was significantly increased (1.05 nS) relative to porin 67d (0.73 nS). Porin 67d was twice as permeable to cations as porin 69a, and at both positive and negative polarities the extent of voltage gating was greater for porin 67d relative to porin 69a. Expression of the porins in an isogenic, porin-deleted H. influenzae background allowed for assessment of the contribution of each porin to the minimum inhibitory concentrations of various antimicrobial compounds. Porin 67d was found to have a decreased susceptibility to the antimicrobials novobiocin and streptomycin. This decreased susceptibility of porin 67d to novobiocin and streptomycin correlates with its decrease in single-channel conductance.
TI  - Acceleration of genomic evolution caused by enhanced mutation rate in endocellular symbionts.
AB  - Endosymbionts, which are widely observed in nature, have undergone reductive genome evolution because of their long-term intracellular lifestyle. Here we compared the complete genome sequences of two different endosymbionts, Buchnera and a protist mitochondrion, with their close relatives to study the evolutionary rates of functional genes in endosymbionts. The results indicate that the rate of amino acid substitution is two times higher in symbionts than in their relatives. This rate increase was observed uniformly among different functional classes of genes, although strong purifying selection may have counterbalanced the rate increase in a few cases. Our data suggest that, contrary to current views, neither the Muller's ratchet effect nor the slightly deleterious mutation theory sufficiently accounts for the elevated evolutionary rate. Rather, the elevated evolutionary rate appears to be mainly due to enhanced mutation rate, although the possibility of relaxation of purifying selection cannot be ruled out.
TI  - [Genomics of pathogenic bacteria].
AB  - The general principles of structural and functional organization of genomes in pathogenic bacteria are considered. Main data on the specific features of genomes of Chlamydia trachomatis, Rickettsia prowazekii, Treponema pallidum, Helicobacter pylori, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Vibro cholerae and pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli are summarized. Particular attention is paid to the problems of genetic control of pathogenicity, intraspecies variations in bacterial genomes, to the environmental and evolutionary meaning of horizontal gene transfer. Whether methods for genotyping bacterial strains can be used is discussed.
TI  - Structure of 2C-methyl-D-erythrol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase from Haemophilus  influenzae: activation by conformational transition.
AB  
TI  - In vitro selection of resistance in Haemophilus influenzae by amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefpodoxime, cefprozil, azithromycin, and clarithromycin.
AB  - Abilities of amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefpodoxime, cefprozil, azithromycin, and clarithromycin to select resistant mutants of Haemophilus influenzae were tested by multistep and single-step methodologies. For multistep studies, 10 random strains were tested: 5 of these were beta-lactamase positive. After 50 daily subcultures in amoxicillin-clavulanate, MICs did not increase more than fourfold. However, cefprozil MICs increased eightfold for one strain. Clarithromycin and azithromycin gave a >4-fold increase in 8 and 10 strains after 14 to 46 and 20 to 50 days, respectively. Mutants selected by clarithromycin and azithromycin were associated with mutations in 23S rRNA and ribosomal proteins L4 and L22. Three mutants selected by clarithromycin or azithromycin had alterations in ribosomal protein L4, while five had alterations in ribosomal protein L22. Two mutants selected by azithromycin had mutations in the gene encoding 23S rRNA: one at position 2058 and the other at position 2059 (Escherichia coli numbering), with replacement of A by G. One clone selected by clarithromycin became hypersusceptible to macrolides. In single-step studies azithromycin and clarithromycin had the highest mutation rates, while amoxicillin-clavulanate had the lowest. All resistant clones were identical to parents as observed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The MICs of azithromycin for azithromycin-resistant clones were 16 to >128 micro g/ml, and those of clarithromycin for clarithromycin-resistant clones were 32 to >128 micro g/ml in multistep studies. For strains selected by azithromycin, the MICs of clarithromycin were high and vice versa. After 50 daily subcultures in the presence of drugs, MICs of amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefpodoxime against H. influenzae did not rise more than fourfold, in contrast to cefprozil, azithromycin, and clarithromycin, whose MICs rose to variable degrees.
TI  - N-alkyl urea hydroxamic acids as a new class of peptide deformylase inhibitors with antibacterial activity.
AB  - Peptide deformylase (PDF) is a prokaryotic metalloenzyme that is essential for bacterial growth and is a new target for the development of antibacterial agents. All previously reported PDF inhibitors with sufficient antibacterial activity share the structural feature of a 2-substituted alkanoyl at the P(1)' site. Using a combination of iterative parallel synthesis and traditional medicinal chemistry, we have identified a new class of PDF inhibitors with N-alkyl urea at the P(1)' site. Compounds with MICs of <or=4 micro g/ml against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae, have been identified. The concentrations needed to inhibit 50% of enzyme activity (IC(50)s) for Escherichia coli Ni-PDF were <or=0.1 micro M, demonstrating the specificity of the inhibitors. In addition, these compounds were very selective for PDF, with IC(50)s of consistently >200 micro M for matrilysin and other mammalian metalloproteases. Structure-activity relationship analysis identified preferred substitutions resulting in improved potency and decreased cytotoxity. One of the compounds (VRC4307) was cocrystallized with PDF, and the enzyme-inhibitor structure was determined at a resolution of 1.7 A. This structural information indicated that the urea compounds adopt a binding position similar to that previously determined for succinate hydroxamates. Two compounds, VRC4232 and VRC4307, displayed in vivo efficacy in a mouse protection assay, with 50% protective doses of 30.8 and 17.9 mg/kg of body weight, respectively. These N-alkyl urea hydroxamic acids provide a starting point for identifying new PDF inhibitors that can serve as antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Evolution of multi-gene segments in the mutS-rpoS intergenic region of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the 12.6 kb region between the mutS and rpoS genes of  Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 (S. typhimurium) was compared to other enteric bacterial mutS-rpoS intergenic regions. The mutS-rpoS region is composed of three distinct segments, designated HK, O and S, as defined by sequence similarities to contiguous ORFs in other bacteria. Inverted chromosomal orientations of each of these segments are found between the mutS and rpoS genes in related ENTEROBACTERIACEAE: The HK segment is distantly related to a cluster of seven ORFs found in Haemophilus influenzae and a cluster of five ORFs found between the mutS and rpoS genes in Escherichia coli K-12. The O segment is related to the mutS-rpoS intergenic region found in E. coli O157:H7 and Shigella dysenteriae type 1. The third segment, S, is common to diverse Salmonella species, but is absent from E. coli. Despite the extensive collinearity and conservation of the overall genetic maps of S. typhimurium and E. coli K-12, the insertions, deletions and inversions in the mutS-rpoS region provide evidence that this region of the chromosome is an active site for horizontal gene transfer and rearrangement.
TI  - Single-tube, nested PCR for the diagnosis of human brucellosis in Kuwait.
AB  - The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) offers a sensitive and specific way of detecting microbial DNA in clinical samples. The aims of the present study were to develop an assay, based on a single-tube, nested PCR, for identifying Brucella in samples of human blood and then to explore the use of this test in diagnosis. The primers chosen were derived from IS711, the insertion sequence gene found in all species of Brucella. The assay amplified a 52-bp final product which was detected colorimetrically. The PCR was sensitive and specific, giving positive reactions with 14 strains of Brucella from five species. The lower limit of detection in vitro was 30 organisms. There were no false-positive reactions either with a range of bacteria known to evoke serological cross-reactions with Brucella (Vibrio cholerae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli K12) or with organisms producing similar clinical syndromes (Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Salmonella typhi). The results of a preliminary field trial of the assay in Kuwait indicate that the assay may be a valuable technique in the diagnosis of human brucellosis, meriting further study with larger numbers of cases. All 28 subjects with brucellosis (diagnosed on the basis of typical clinical features and confirmed by positive serology and, in three cases, by positive blood cultures) were PCR-positive whereas 28 healthy controls and 28 patients with febrile illness attributable to infections other than brucellosis were PCR-negative.
TI  - Structure and function of Hib pili from Haemophilus influenzae type b.
AB  - Pathogenic bacteria are specifically adapted to bind to their customary host. Disease is then caused by subsequent colonization and/or invasion of the local environmental niche. Initial binding of Haemophilus influenzae type b to the human nasopharynx is facilitated by Hib pili, filaments expressed on the bacterial surface. With three-dimensional reconstruction of electron micrograph images, we show that Hib pili comprise a helix 70 A in diameter with threefold symmetry. The Hib pilus filament has 3.0 subunits per turn, with each set of three subunits translated 26.9 A along and rotated 53 degrees about the helical axis. Amino acid sequence analysis of pilins from Hib pili and from P-pili expressed on uropathogenic Escherichia coli were used to predict the physical location of the highly variable and immunogenic region of the HifA pilin in the Hib pilus structure. Structural differences between Hib pili and P-pili suggest a difference in the strategies by which bacteria remain bound to their host cells: P-pili were shown to be capable of unwinding to five times their original length (E. Bullitt and L. Makowski, Nature 373:164-167, 1995), while damage to Hib pili occurs by slight shearing of subunits with respect to those further along the helical axis. This capacity to resist unwinding may be important for continued adherence of H. influenzae type b to the nasopharynx, where the three-stranded Hib pilus filaments provide a robust tether to withstand coughs and sneezes.
TI  - Transplanting allosteric control of enzyme activity by protein-protein interactions: coupling a regulatory site to the conserved catalytic core.
AB  - Glycerol kinase from Escherichia coli, but not Haemophilus influenzae, is inhibited allosterically by phosphotransferase system protein IIA(Glc). The primary structures of these related kinases contain 501 amino acids, differing at 117. IIA(Glc) inhibition is transplanted from E. coli glycerol kinase into H. influenzae glycerol kinase by interconverting only 11 of the differences: 8 residues that interact with IIA(Glc) at the allosteric binding site and 3 residues in the conserved ATPase catalytic core that do not interact with IIA(Glc) but the solvent accessible surface of which decreases when it binds. The three core residues are crucial for coupling the allosteric site to the conserved catalytic core of the enzyme. The site of the coupling residues identifies a regulatory locus in the sugar kinase/heat shock protein 70/actin superfamily and suggests relations between allosteric regulation and the active site closure that characterizes the family. The location of the coupling residues provides empirical validation of a computational model that predicts a coupling pathway between the IIA(Glc)-binding site and the active site [Luque, I. & Freire, E. (2000) Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. Suppl. 4, 63-71]. The requirement for changes in core residues to couple the allosteric and active sites and switching from inhibition to activation by a single amino acid change are consistent with a postulated mechanism for molecular evolution of allosteric regulation.
TI  - Calculation of composite recovery time: a new pharmacodynamic parameter.
AB  - A new pharmacodynamic parameter, the composite recovery time (CRT), is described  and used to calculate species-specific MIC breakpoints. Moxifloxacin data were used for illustration. This required determination of MICs, kill curves and post-antibiotic sub-MIC effect values. Thirteen test isolates included Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The concentration at which the CRT equals the dosing interval is the minimum effective concentration, and is effectively the breakpoint. The breakpoints were calculated as 2 mg/L for the pneumococci and quinolone-susceptible H. influenzae isolate, 1 mg/L for staphylococci and 0.5 mg/L for Enterobacteriaceae. Calculated pharmacodynamic breakpoints were very similar to traditional published MIC breakpoints.
TI  - Genome-scale metabolic model of Helicobacter pylori 26695.
AB  - A genome-scale metabolic model of Helicobacter pylori 26695 was constructed from  genome sequence annotation, biochemical, and physiological data. This represents an in silico model largely derived from genomic information for an organism for which there is substantially less biochemical information available relative to previously modeled organisms such as Escherichia coli. The reconstructed metabolic network contains 388 enzymatic and transport reactions and accounts for 291 open reading frames. Within the paradigm of constraint-based modeling, extreme-pathway analysis and flux balance analysis were used to explore the metabolic capabilities of the in silico model. General network properties were analyzed and compared to similar results previously generated for Haemophilus influenzae. A minimal medium required by the model to generate required biomass constituents was calculated, indicating the requirement of eight amino acids, six of which correspond to essential human amino acids. In addition a list of potential substrates capable of fulfilling the bulk carbon requirements of H. pylori were identified. A deletion study was performed wherein reactions and associated genes in central metabolism were deleted and their effects were simulated under a variety of substrate availability conditions, yielding a number of reactions that are deemed essential. Deletion results were compared to recently published in vitro essentiality determinations for 17 genes. The in silico model accurately predicted 10 of 17 deletion cases, with partial support for additional cases. Collectively, the results presented herein suggest an effective strategy of combining in silico modeling with experimental technologies to enhance biological discovery for less characterized organisms and their genomes.
TI  - Identification and incidence of fungal strains in chronic rhinosinusitis patients.
AB  - The fungal revolution taking place in otorhinology inspired us to study the frequency of occurrence of fungi in the nasal mucus of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) patients (with or without polyposis) in order to evaluate the incidence of eosinophilic fungal sinusitis in CRS patients. Ninety-six samples were examined from patients with CRS. In 74 cases mucus was collected non-invasively, and in 22 cases during operation. The Gram-stained direct smears of all samples were also evaluated. Bacteria and fungi colonizing in the mucus were detected by culturing method. The control group consisted of 50 healthy volunteers. Typical aerobic pathogenic bacteria could be isolated from 34 patients. Fifty-seven aerobic bacteria were isolated, i.e. 1.6 bacteria/positive patient with a maximum of 3 different bacteria/sample. The most frequently isolated bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae. Yeasts and moulds could be detected from 79 patients (83%): Candida albicans, Candida spp., Aspergillus spp., Cladosporium spp, and Penicillium spp. were isolated most frequently. Altogether 237 yeasts and moulds were isolated, i.e. 3.0 different fungi/positive patient, with a maximum of 5 different fungi/sample. In the control group aerobic pathogens were not isolated, only apathogenic species. Fungi were isolated from 22 healthy patients (44%). These data indicate that fungi are frequently involved in the aetiology of CRS. IgE-medicated hypersensitivity to fungal allergens could not be proven in our patients.
TI  - Molecular analysis of a haemagglutinin of Haemophilus paragallinarum.
AB  - The gene encoding a haemagglutinin of H. paragallinarum, hagA, has been identified and the full-length nucleotide sequence determined. A approximately 39 kDa protein, recognized by an anti-haemagglutinin monoclonal antibody, mAb4D, was purified from H. paragallinarum strain 0083 and the N-terminal sequence obtained. The full-length nucleotide sequence was obtained by inverse PCR and the deduced amino acid sequence of the protein encoded was shown to be similar to other outer-membrane proteins of closely related organisms in the HAP group (Haemophilus, Actinobacillus, Pasteurella), especially the P5 protein of Haemophilus influenzae. The hagA gene was cloned into a His-tag expression vector and overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain M15(pREP4). The identity of the purified recombinant protein as a H. paragallinarum haemagglutinin was confirmed by haemagglutination of chicken red blood cells and reactivity, in a Western blot, with the monoclonal antibody specific for the serovar A haemagglutinin.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the serine dehydrogenase gene from Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
AB  - The structural gene for NADP+-dependent serine dehydrogenase [EC 1.1.1.-] from Agrobacterium tumefaciens ICR 1600 was cloned into Escherichia coli cells and its complete DNA sequence was analyzed. The gene encodes a polypeptide containing 249 amino acid residues. The enzyme had high sequence similarity to short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases from bacteria and unknown proteins of Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
TI  - Overexpression and biochemical characterization of beta-1,3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase LgtD from Haemophilus influenzae strain Rd.
AB  - The lipopolysaccharide of capsule deficient Haemophilus influenzae strain Rd contains an N-acetylgalactosamine residue attached to the terminal globotriose moiety in the Hex5 glycoform. Genome analysis identified an open reading frame HI1578, referred to as lgtD, whose amino acid sequence shows significant level of similarity to a number of bacterial glycosyltransferases involved in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis. To investigate its function, overexpression and biochemical characterization were performed. Most of the protein was obtained in a highly soluble and active form. By using standard glycosyltransferase assay and HPLC, we show that LgtD is an N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase with high donor substrate specificity and globotriose is a highly preferred acceptor substrate for the enzyme. The K(m) for UDP-GalNAc and globotriose are 58 microM and 8.6 mM, respectively. The amino acid sequence of the enzyme shows the conserved features of family II glycosyltransferases. This is the first N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase identified from H. influenzae, which shows potential application in large-scale synthesis of globo-series oligosaccharides.
TI  - Expression and purification of aspartate beta-semialdehyde dehydrogenase from infectious microorganisms.
AB  - l-Aspartate-beta-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (ASA DH) lies at the first branch point in the aspartate metabolic pathway that leads to the formation of the amino acids lysine, isoleucine, methionine, and threonine in most plants, bacteria, and fungi. Since the aspartate pathway is not found in humans, but is necessary for bacterial cell wall biosynthesis, the enzymes in this pathway are potential targets for the development of new antibiotics. The asd gene that encodes for ASA DH has been obtained from several infectious organisms and ligated into a pET expression vector. ASA DHs from Haemophilus influenza, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Vibrio cholerae were expressed as soluble proteins in Escherichia coli, while ASA DH from Helicobacter pylori was obtained primarily as inclusion bodies. The V. cholerae genome contains two asd genes. Both enzymes have been expressed and purified, and each displays significant ASA DH activity. The purification of highly active ASA DH from each of these organisms has been achieved for the first time, in greater than 95% purity and high overall yield. Kinetic parameters have been determined for each purified enzyme, and the values have been compared to those of E. coli ASA DH.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, and carbapenems. Thirty-two species 2,697 strains of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis (n = 125), Escherichia coli (n = 250), Citrobacter freundii (n = 153), Citrobacter koseri (n = 97), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 150), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 100), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 50), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 125), Serratia marcescens (n = 153), Proteus mirabillis (n = 103), Proteus vulgaris (n = 77), Morganella morganii (n = 141), Providencia spp. (P. alcalifaciens, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii; n = 154), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 211), Pseudomonas putida (n = 49), Burkholderia cepacia (n = 102), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 101), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 210), Acinetobactor baumannii (n = 63), Acinetobactor Iwoffii (n = 30), Bacteroides fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron; n = 129), and Prevotella spp. (P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. bivia, P. oralis, P. denticola; n = 124). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, C. freundii, C. koseri, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, Providencia spp., P. aeruginosa, and A. lowffii throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. On the other hand, the MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 65-time difference during study period. The MIC90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against H. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. The present results demonstrated that CZOP had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost Gram-negative strains tested. However, the decrease in the antibacterial activity of CZOP against H. influenzae was suggested.
TI  - Potency and antimicrobial spectrum update for piperacillin/tazobactam (2000): emphasis on its activity against resistant organism populations and generally untested species causing community-acquired respiratory tract infections.
AB  - The in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam and several comparison broad-spectrum compounds was assessed against recent clinical isolates of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria from geographically diverse medical centers in Europe, North and Latin America participating in various surveillance programs in 2000. Several organisms were characterized for phenotypic expression of various resistant determinants such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or amp C cephalosporinase hyperproduction, and vancomycin resistance in enterococci (VRE). Piperacillin/tazobactam retained activity (MIC50) against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus spp. (0.12-0.5 microg/ml), Bacillus spp. (0.5 microg/ml), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (>4 microg/ml), and Corynebacterium spp. (2 microg/ml; not including C. jeikeium) with susceptibility rates of 100.0, 91.7, 85.7 and 81.8%, respectively. Piperacillin/tazobactam inhibited all Streptococcus spp. strains at < or = 16 microg/ml, including penicillin-resistant strains many of which were co-resistant to erythromycin (90%) and other beta-lactams. A specific breakpoint for these streptococci when testing piperacillin/tazobactam appears needed to prevent false-resistant reports using penicillin as a class representative. The carbapenems among beta-lactams were the most active agents against the ESBL-producing species of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae and those strains which hyper-express amp C enzymes including Citrobacter spp. and Enterobacter spp. Piperacillin/tazobactam only exhibited modest activity against the "amp C resistance group" strains (68.8% susceptible or intermediate, MIC < or = 64 microg/ml). Piperacillin/tazobactam (MIC50, 8 microg/ml; 79.5% susceptible) was the most active agent tested against multi-drug resistant isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against sampled Haemophilus influenzae (39.2% ampicillin-resistant), piperacillin/tazobactam (MIC(90,) < or = 0.06 microg/ml), ceftriaxone and ceftazidime inhibited 100.0% of the isolates at < or = 0.25 microg/ml. These in vitro surveillance results from the year 2000 on three continents, demonstrated a sustained potent activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against selected problematic nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. The potential importance of these findings is that this beta-lactamase inhibitor combination can be used an empiric treatment of serious infections in hospital environments where resistance has emerged, as well as covering nearly all isolates of fastidious respiratory tract pathogens acquired in the community setting.
TI  - Antibacterial activities and characterization of novel inhibitors of LpxC.
AB  - Lipid A is the hydrophobic anchor of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and forms the major lipid component of the outer monolayer of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. Lipid A is required for bacterial growth and virulence, and inhibition of its biosynthesis is lethal to bacteria. UDP-3-O-(R-3-hydroxymyristoyl)-N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase (LpxC) is a metalloenzyme that catalyzes the second step in the biosynthesis of lipid A. Inhibitors of LpxC have previously been shown to have antibiotic activities. We have screened a metalloenzyme inhibitor library for antibacterial activities against an Escherichia coli strain with reduced LpxC activity. From this screen, a series of sulfonamide derivatives of the alpha-(R)-amino hydroxamic acids, exemplified by BB-78484 and BB-78485, have been identified as having potent inhibitory activities against LpxC in an in vitro assay. Leads from this series showed gram-negative selective activities against members of the Enterobacteriaceae, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Burkholderia cepacia. BB-78484 was bactericidal against E. coli, achieving 3-log killing in 4 h at a concentration 4 times above the MIC, as would be predicted for an inhibitor of lipid A biosynthesis. E. coli mutants with decreased susceptibility to BB-78484 were selected. Analysis of these mutants revealed that resistance arose as a consequence of mutations in the fabZ or lpxC genes. These data confirm the antibacterial target of BB-78484 and BB-78485 and validate LpxC as a target for gram-negative selective antibacterials.
TI  - Molecular cloning of the fur gene from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - In several bacterial species, iron availability in host tissues is coordinated with the expression of virulence determinants through the fur gene product. Initial experiments showed that a cloned Escherichia coli fur gene probe hybridized to Southern blots of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strain JP2 (serotype b) chromosomal DNA. The A. actinomycetemcomitans fur gene was then cloned utilizing partial functional complementation of the fur mutant in E. coli strain H1780. Analysis of the cloned DNA sequence revealed a 438-bp open reading frame with a deduced 146-amino-acid sequence exhibiting 80% identity to Haemophilus influenzae Fur and 62% identity to E. coli Fur. The pUC Aafur gene probe (generated from JP2 serotype b) hybridized to representatives from all five A. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes as well as to two strains derived from monkeys, suggesting that fur is widely distributed in A. actinomycetemcomitans. Open reading frames having >70% identity with the E. coli and H. influenzae flavodoxin and gyrase A genes, respectively, were found. Expression of the A. actinomycetemcomitans fur gene product repressed fiu expression and siderophore production in E. coli. A gel shift assay demonstrated that the expressed A. actinomycetemcomitans Fur protein bound the bacterial fur consensus sequence. Further characterization of the fur gene product in A. actinomycetemcomitans may improve our understanding of its role in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease and may lead to specific therapeutic modalities.
TI  - Ceftriaxone activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens isolated in US clinical microbiology laboratories from 1996 to 2000: results from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA.
AB  - Ceftriaxone was introduced into clinical practice in the USA in 1985 and was the  first extended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporin approved for once-daily treatment of patients with Gram-positive or Gram-negative infections. Review of ceftriaxone activity is important given its continued use since the mid-1980s and reports of emerging resistance among all antimicrobial agent classes. We reviewed the activity of ceftriaxone and relevant comparative agents against five Gram-positive and 11 Gram-negative species for a 5-year period, 1996-2000, using data from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA. All MIC results were interpreted using NCCLS breakpoint criteria. Ceftriaxone resistance among isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=17219) remained essentially unchanged over the 5 years studied and in fact was lower from 1998 to 2000 (5.0-5.1%) than in 1996 (6.3%) and 1997 (6.6%). Ceftriaxone resistance (range, 5.1-6.9%) among viridans group streptococci (n=6621) varied by <2% from 1997 to 2000. Beta-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes (n=935) and group B beta-haemolytic streptococci (n=2267) were not identified in any year. Among methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (n=39 284) ceftriaxone resistance was 0.1-0.3% per year from 1996 to 2000. Ceftriaxone resistance among Escherichia coli (n=472407; range, 0.2-0.4%), Klebsiella oxytoca (n=16231; range, 3.5-4.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=117754; range, 1.9-2.6%), Proteus mirabilis (n=67692; range, 0.2-0.3%), Morganella morganii (n=11251; range, 0.3-2.1%) and Serratia marcescens (n=26519; range, 1.6-3.8%) was low and consistent from 1996 to 2000. Resistance to ceftriaxone among Enterobacter cloacae (n=48114; range, 21.7-23.9%) was relatively high, compared with other Enterobacteriaceae, but unchanged from 1996 to 2000. Rates of resistance to ceftriaxone among Acinetobacter spp. (n=20813) increased from 24.8% in 1996 to 45.1% in 2000. All Haemophilus influenzae (n=7911) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (n=218) were susceptible to ceftriaxone, as were 99.7% of Moraxella catarrhalis (n=312) tested in 1996 and 1997. In summary, ceftriaxone has retained its potent activity against the most commonly encountered Gram-positive and Gram-negative human pathogens despite widespread and ongoing clinical use for more than 15 years.
TI  - The Escherichia coli gene encoding the UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine pyrophosphatase  of lipid A biosynthesis.
AB  - UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine hydrolase is believed to catalyze the fourth step of lipid A biosynthesis in Escherichia coli. This reaction involves pyrophosphate bond hydrolysis of the precursor UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine to yield 2,3-diacylglucosamine 1-phosphate and UMP. To identify the gene encoding this hydrolase, E. coli lysates generated with individual lambda clones of the ordered Kohara library were assayed for overexpression of the enzyme. The sequence of lambda clone 157[6E7], promoting overproduction of hydrolase activity, was examined for genes encoding hypothetical proteins of unknown function. The amino acid sequence of one such open reading frame, ybbF, is 50.5% identical to a Haemophilus influenzae hypothetical protein and is also conserved in most other Gram-negative organisms, but is absent in Gram-positives. Cell extracts prepared from cells overexpressing ybbF behind the T7lac promoter have approximately 540 times more hydrolase activity than cells with vector alone. YbbF was purified to approximately 60% homogeneity, and its catalytic properties were examined. Enzymatic activity is maximal at pH 8 and is inhibited by 0.01% (or more) Triton X-100. The apparent K(m) for UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine is 62 microm. YbbF requires a diacylated substrate and does not cleave CDP-diacylglycerol. (31)P NMR studies of the UMP product generated from UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine in the presence of 40% H(2)180 show that the enzyme attacks the alpha-phosphate group of the UDP moiety. Because ybbF encodes the specific UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine hydrolase involved in lipid A biosynthesis, it is now designated lpxH.
TI  - Determination of redundancy and systems properties of the metabolic network of Helicobacter pylori using genome-scale extreme pathway analysis.
AB  - The capabilities of genome-scale metabolic networks can be described through the  determination of a set of systemically independent and unique flux maps called extreme pathways. The first study of genome-scale extreme pathways for the simultaneous formation of all nonessential amino acids or ribonucleotides in Helicobacter pylori is presented. Three key results were obtained. First, the extreme pathways for the production of individual amino acids in H. pylori showed far fewer internal states per external state than previously found in Haemophilus influenzae, indicating a more rigid metabolic network. Second, the degree of pathway redundancy in H. pylori was essentially the same for the production of individual amino acids and linked amino acid sets, but was approximately twice that of the production of the ribonucleotides. Third, the metabolic network of H. pylori was unable to achieve extensive conversion of amino acids consumed to the set of either nonessential amino acids or ribonucleotides and thus diverted a large portion of its nitrogen to ammonia production, a potentially important result for pH regulation in its acidic habitat. Genome-scale extreme pathways elucidate emergent system-wide properties. Extreme pathway analysis is emerging as a potentially important method to analyze the link between the metabolic genotype and its phenotypes.
TI  - Impact of registration procedures on antibiotic policies.
AB  - There is increasing concern over antibiotic resistance and its spread in common bacterial species, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli. This results in increased morbidity and mortality. Over consumption of antibiotics has been reported in many settings and underlines the need for improving antibiotic policies. Crude measures of both antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance do not share a strong cause-and-effect relationship. However, this relationship is highly suggestive at a country level, at a hospital level, at a cohort level and at an individual level. In addition to overuse, antibiotic misuse has also to be considered, because of its impact on promoting antibiotic resistance, related to choice, dosage, dosing regimen or duration of therapy [1].
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. Changes in CZOP susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with the breakpoint MIC. Twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), Escherichia coli (n = 276), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 93), Serratia marcescens (n = 172), Serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), Citrobacter freundii (n = 177), Citrobacter koseri (n = 70), Proteus mirabilis (n = 113), Proteus vulgaris (n = 89), Morganella morganii (n = 116), Providencia spp. (n = 41), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), Pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), Pseudomonas putida (n = 63), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), Acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), Burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and Prevotella/Porphyromonas (n = 173). An antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, and S. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. MIC90 of CZOP against M.(B.) catarrhalis, C. koseri, and P. aeruginosa was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. MIC90 of CZOP against E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, and P. mirabilis increased year by year. The increase in MIC90 of CZOP against E. aerogenes and P. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. In contract, the susceptibility of E. cloacae to CZOP was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to CZOP. MIC90 of CZOP against C. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. Additionally, MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against P. fluorescens, P. putida, B. cepacia, S. maltophilia, B. fragilis group, and Prevotella/Porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. Changes in MIC90 of CZOP against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.
TI  - NB2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  - Enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ECTA) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-Lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. We present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ECTA compounds, NB2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. Unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of NB2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. Evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) NB2001 is a substrate for TEM-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/K(m)) of greater than 77,000 M-1 s-1. (ii) Triclosan is detected in NB2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli but not in E. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) NB2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing E. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. NB2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae. NB2001 is also active against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae. The results indicate that NB2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent and demonstrate the potential of ECTA in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.
TI  - The YbgC protein encoded by the ybgC gene of the tol-pal gene cluster of Haemophilus influenzae catalyzes acyl-coenzyme A thioester hydrolysis.
AB  - This paper examines the catalytic function of the protein YbgC, encoded by the ybgC gene of the tol-pal gene cluster in Haemophilus influenzae. The YbgC protein, a homologue of the Pseudomonas sp. strain CBS3 4-hydroxybenzoyl-coenzyme A thioesterase, conserves the active site Asp residue associated with thioesterase activity. The H. influenzae ybgC gene was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein was purified and tested for thioesterase activity towards acyl-CoA and acyl-N-acetylcysteamine thioesters. The YbgC protein catalyzes the hydrolysis of short chain aliphatic acyl-CoA thioesters, while the D18N YbgC mutant protein (prepared to serve as a control) does not.
TI  - Haemophilus influenzae and Vibrio cholerae genes for mutH are able to fully complement a mutH defect in Escherichia coli.
AB  - MutH, MutL and MutS are essential components of the mismatch repair system in Escherichia coli. Whereas mutS and mutL genes are found in most organisms, the mutH gene is limited to some proteobacteria. We show here that the cloned genes of MutH from Vibrio cholerae and Haemophilus influenzae are able to fully complement a mutH defect in E. coli. Moreover, the purified proteins were shown to be dam methylation sensitive endonucleases, which can be activated by the E. coli MutL protein. These results allow to narrow down regions that are important for the interaction of MutH with MutL.
TI  - Meningitis in the Neonate.
AB  - Group B beta-hemolytic streptococci and Escherichia coli strains account for approximately two thirds of all cases of neonatal meningitis, while bacteria that typically account for meningitis in older age groups (Haemophilus influenzae type B, Neisseria meningitidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae) are infrequent causes of meningitis in the neonatal population. As with other medical problems in neonates, signs and symptoms of bacterial infection of the central nervous system are generally few in number and nonspecific in nature. Manifestations that can suggest meningitis, as well as other serious illnesses, include temperature instability, lethargy, respiratory distress, poor feeding, vomiting, and diarrhea. Signs suggestive of meningeal irritation, including stiff neck, bulging fontanelle, convulsions, and opisthotonus, occur only in a minority of neonates with bacterial meningitis and cannot be relied on solely to identify such patients. Ampicillin and either gentamicin or cefotaxime are recommended for initial empiric therapy of neonatal meningitis. When the results of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture and susceptibilities are known, therapy can be narrowed to cover the specific pathogen identified. In general, penicillin G or ampicillin is preferred for group B streptococcal meningitis, ampicillin for Listeria monocytogenes meningitis, and ampicillin plus either an aminoglycoside or cefotaxime for gram-negative meningitis. For the very low birth weight neonate who has been in the nursery for a prolonged period of time, organisms such as enterococci and gentamicin-resistant gram-negative enteric bacilli must also be considered. In patients with long-term vascular catheters, Staphylococcus aureus or coagulase-negative staphylococci must also be considered. Empiric combinations of antibiotics for such patients would include ampicillin or vancomycin, plus amikacin or cefotaxime. All neonates should undergo repeat CSF examination and culture at 48 to 72 hours after initiation of therapy. If organisms are observed on gram stain, modification of the therapeutic regimen should be considered, and neuroimaging should be performed. In general, therapy should be continued for 14 to 21 days for neonatal meningitis caused by group B streptococci or L. monocytogenes, and for at least 21 days for disease caused by gram-negative enteric bacilli. All patients with neonatal meningitis should have hearing and development monitored serially. The first audiologic evaluation should occur 4 to 6 weeks after resolution of the meningitis.
TI  - Bacteriophage Mu genome sequence: analysis and comparison with Mu-like prophages  in Haemophilus, Neisseria and Deinococcus.
AB  - We report the complete 36,717 bp genome sequence of bacteriophage Mu and provide  an analysis of the sequence, both with regard to the new genes and other genetic features revealed by the sequence itself and by a comparison to eight complete or nearly complete Mu-like prophage genomes found in the genomes of a diverse group of bacteria. The comparative studies confirm that members of the Mu-related family of phage genomes are genetically mosaic with respect to each other, as seen in other groups of phages such as the phage lambda-related group of phages of enteric hosts and the phage L5-related group of mycobacteriophages. Mu also possesses segments of similarity, typically gene-sized, to genomes of otherwise non-Mu-like phages. The comparisons show that some well-known features of the Mu genome, including the invertible segment encoding tail fiber sequences, are not present in most members of the Mu genome sequence family examined here, suggesting that their presence may be relatively volatile over evolutionary time. The head and tail-encoding structural genes of Mu have only very weak similarity to the corresponding genes of other well-studied phage types. However, these weak similarities, and in some cases biochemical data, can be used to establish tentative functional assignments for 12 of the head and tail genes. These assignments are strongly supported by the fact that the order of gene functions assigned in this way conforms to the strongly conserved order of head and tail genes established in a wide variety of other phages. We show that the Mu head assembly scaffolding protein is encoded by a gene nested in-frame within the C-terminal half of another gene that encodes the putative head maturation protease. This is reminiscent of the arrangement established for phage lambda.
TI  - Bioinformatic assessment of mass spectrometric chemical derivatisation techniques for proteome database searching.
AB  - Identification of proteins from the mass spectra of peptide fragments generated by proteolytic cleavage using database searching has become one of the most powerful techniques in proteome science, capable of rapid and efficient protein identification. Using computer simulation, we have studied how the application of chemical derivatisation techniques may improve the efficiency of protein identification from mass spectrometric data. These approaches enhance ion yield and lead to the promotion of specific ions and fragments, yielding additional database search information. The impact of three alternative techniques has been assessed by searching representative proteome databases for both single proteins and simple protein mixtures. For example, by reliably promoting fragmentation of singly-charged peptide ions at aspartic acid residues after homoarginine derivatisation, 82% of yeast proteins can be unambiguously identified from a single typical peptide-mass datum, with a measured mass accuracy of 50 ppm, by using the associated secondary ion data. The extra search information also provides a means to confidently identify proteins in protein mixtures where only limited data are available. Furthermore, the inclusion of limited sequence information for the peptides can compensate and exceed the search efficiency available via high accuracy searches of around 5 ppm, suggesting that this is a potentially useful approach for simple protein mixtures routinely obtained from two-dimensional gels.
TI  - Structural biology of bacterial iron uptake systems.
AB  - Numerous bacterial proteins are involved in microbial iron uptake and transport and considerable variation has been found in the uptake schemes used by different bacterial species. However, whether extracting iron from host proteins such as transferrin, lactoferrin or hemoglobin or importing low molecular weight iron-chelating compounds such as heme, citrate or siderophores, Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria typically employ a specific outer membrane receptor, a periplasmic binding protein and two inner membrane associated proteins: a transporter coupled with an ATP-hydrolyzing protein. Often, studies have shown that proteins with similar function but little amino acid sequence homology are structurally related. Elucidation of the structures of the Escherichia coli outer membrane siderophore transport proteins FepA and FhuA have provided the first insights into the conformational changes required for ligand transport through the bacterial outer membrane. The variations between the structures of the prototypical periplasmic ferric binding protein FbpA from Neisseria and Haemophilus influenzae and the unusual E coli periplasmic siderophore binding protein FhuD reveal that the different periplasmic ligand binding proteins exercise distinct mechanisms for ligand binding and release. The structure of the hemophore HasA from Serratia marcescens shows how heme may be extracted and utilized by the bacteria. Other biochemical evidence also shows that the proteins that provide energy for iron transport at the outer membrane, such as the TonB-ExbB-ExbD system, are structurally very similar across bacterial species. Likewise, the iron-sensitive gene regulatory protein Fur is found in most bacteria. To date, no structural information is available for Fur, but the structure for the related protein DxtR has been determined. Together, these three-dimensional structures complement our knowledge of iron transport systems from other pathogenic bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which has a number of homologous iron uptake proteins. More importantly, the current structures for iron transport proteins provide rational starting points for design of novel antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Complete genomic sequence of SfV, a serotype-converting temperate bacteriophage of Shigella flexneri.
AB  - Bacteriophage SfV is a temperate serotype-converting phage of Shigella flexneri.  SfV encodes the factors involved in type V O-antigen modification, and the serotype conversion and integration-excision modules of the phage have been isolated and characterized. We now report on the complete sequence of the SfV genome (37,074 bp). A total of 53 open reading frames were predicted from the nucleotide sequence, and analysis of the corresponding proteins was used to construct a functional map. The general organization of the genes in the SfV genome is similar to that of bacteriophage lambda, and numerous features of the sequence are described. The superinfection immunity system of SfV includes a lambda-like repression system and a P4-like transcription termination mechanism. Sequence analysis also suggests that SfV encodes multiple DNA methylases, and experiments confirmed that orf-41 encodes a Dam methylase. Studies conducted to determine if the phage-encoded methylase confers host DNA methylation showed that the two S. flexneri strains analyzed encode their own Dam methylase. Restriction mapping and sequence analysis revealed that the phage genome has cos sites at the termini. The tail assembly and structural genes of SfV show homology to those of phage Mu and Mu-like prophages in the genome of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Haemophilus influenzae. Significant homology (30% of the genome in total) between sections of the early, regulatory, and structural regions of the SfV genome and the e14 and KpLE1 prophages in the E. coli K-12 genome were noted, suggesting that these three phages have common evolutionary origins.
TI  - Mutations in polI but not mutSLH destabilize Haemophilus influenzae tetranucleotide repeats.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae (Hi), an obligate upper respiratory tract commensal/pathogen, uses phase variation (PV) to adapt to host environment changes. Switching occurs by slippage of nucleotide repeats (microsatellites) within genes coding for virulence molecules. Most such microsatellites in Hi are tetranucleotide repeats, but an exception is the dinucleotide repeats in the pilin locus. To investigate the effects on PV rates of mutations in genes for mismatch repair (MMR), insertion/deletion mutations of mutS, mutL, mutH, dam, polI, uvrD, mfd and recA were constructed in Hi strain Rd. Only inactivation of polI destabilized tetranucleotide (5'AGTC) repeat tracts of chromosomally located reporter constructs, whereas inactivation of mutS, but not polI, destabilized dinucleotide (5'AT) repeats. Deletions of repeats were predominant in polI mutants, which we propose are due to end-joining occurring without DNA polymerization during polI-deficient Okazaki fragment processing. The high prevalence of tetranucleotides mediating PV is an exceptional feature of the Hi genome. The refractoriness to MMR of hypermutation in Hi tetranucleotides facilitates adaptive switching without the deleterious increase in global mutation rates that accompanies a mutator genotype.
TI  - [Neonatal bacterial infection by maternal-fetal contamination: for a change in approach? 2. Uncertainties and proposals].
AB  - Based on a critical analysis of the literature, it is clear that even though mortality has decreased to 10-15%, the prevalence of neonatal bacterial infections remains dramatically stable. Precise risk factors can be identified in most cases of neonatal infection, but remain uncertain in many others: Streptococcus agalactiae is found in only 40% of the cases of sepsis; Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Pneumococcus, and group A Streptococcus strains should also be considered for a real prophylactic strategy; context (prematurity), lack of a consensual attitude for intrapartum strategies; management schemes for asymptomatic neonates. Based on these observations, we make proposals for a realistic attitude for everyday practice based on risk factors, maternal and neonatal bacterial sampling procedures, and modalities for neonatal antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Domain-level differences in microsatellite distribution and content result from different relative rates of insertion and deletion mutations.
AB  - Microsatellites (short tandem polynucleotide repeats) are found throughout eukaryotic genomes at frequencies many orders of magnitude higher than the frequencies predicted to occur by chance. Most of these microsatellites appear to have evolved in a generally neutral manner. In contrast, microsatellites are generally absent from bacterial genomes except in locations where they provide adaptive functional variability, and these appear to have evolved under selection. We demonstrate a mutational bias towards deletion (repeat contraction) in a native chromosomal microsatellite of the bacterium Mycoplasma gallisepticum, through the collection and analysis of independent mutations in the absence of natural selection. Using this and similar existing data from two other bacterial species and four eukaryotic species, we find strong evidence that deletion biases resulting in repeat contraction are common in bacteria, while eukaryotic microsatellites generally experience unbiased mutation or a bias towards insertion (repeat expansion). This difference in mutational bias suggests that eukaryotic microsatellites should generally expand wherever selection does not exclude them, whereas bacterial microsatellites should be driven to extinction by mutational pressure wherever they are not maintained by selection. This is consistent with observed bacterial and eukaryotic microsatellite distributions. Hence, mutational biases that differ between eukaryotes and bacteria can account for many of the observed differences in microsatellite DNA content and distribution found in these two groups of organisms.
TI  - Production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 in whole blood stimulated by live Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) induced by live Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in whole blood in vitro. METHODS: In all, 49 different isolates were studied. Each of the 49 different isolates was incubated for 4 h with whole blood at a ratio of one monocyte per 1--5 bacteria. Plasma was then separated and frozen, and the concentrations of TNF-alpha and IL-6 were measured by enzyme immunoassays. RESULTS: There was a positive correlation between TNF-alpha and IL-6 values, r=0.9. Gram-negative bacteria induced higher levels of both TNF-alpha and IL-6 than Gram-positive bacteria. Group G streptococci (GGS) induced higher levels of TNF-alpha than Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and group A streptococci (GAS). Klebsiella pneumoniae induced higher levels of TNF-alpha than Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and Neisseria meningitidis. GGS induced higher levels of IL-6 than Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and GAS. When the relative amounts of cytokine induced by the strains were compared to serum concentrations measured on admission in patients with bacteremia caused by the same bacterial isolates there was no significant correlation. CONCLUSION: Species- and strain-related differences in cytokine-inducing properties were found which may have significance in clinical infections.
TI  - From structure to function: YrbI from Haemophilus influenzae (HI1679) is a phosphatase.
AB  - The crystal structure of the YrbI protein from Haemophilus influenzae (HI1679) was determined at a 1.67-A resolution. The function of the protein had not been assigned previously, and it is annotated as hypothetical in sequence databases. The protein exhibits the alpha/beta-hydrolase fold (also termed the Rossmann fold) and resembles most closely the fold of the L-2-haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily. Following this observation, a detailed sequence analysis revealed remote homology to two members of the HAD superfamily, the P-domain of Ca(2+) ATPase and phosphoserine phosphatase. The 19-kDa chains of HI1679 form a tetramer both in solution and in the crystalline form. The four monomers are arranged in a ring such that four beta-hairpin loops, each inserted after the first beta-strand of the core alpha/beta-fold, form an eight-stranded barrel at the center of the assembly. Four active sites are located at the subunit interfaces. Each active site is occupied by a cobalt ion, a metal used for crystallization. The cobalt is octahedrally coordinated to two aspartate side-chains, a backbone oxygen, and three solvent molecules, indicating that the physiological metal may be magnesium. HI1679 hydrolyzes a number of phosphates, including 6-phosphogluconate and phosphotyrosine, suggesting that it functions as a phosphatase in vivo. The physiological substrate is yet to be identified; however the location of the gene on the yrb operon suggests involvement in sugar metabolism.
TI  - Bacteremia in children: etiologic agents, focal sites, and risk factors.
AB  - A prospective study was carried out on 210 cases of children under 10 years of age with fever. Cases of gastroenteritis, respiratory tract infections, and suspected sepsis in children seen or admitted to the pediatric hospital were studied. Clinical and microbiological data were recorded in a questionnaire or obtained from patient medical records. Most of the children with septicemia (71.3 per cent) were less than 1 year old. Focal source of bacteremia was gastroenteritis (40.4 per cent), pneumonia or bronchopneumonia (20 per cent), meningitis (7.4 per cent), and urinary tract infections (7.4 per cent). The predominant pathogens isolated from blood or stool specimens were gram-positive bacteria (53.3 per cent), mainly Streptococcus pneumoniae and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. The gram-negative bacteria (45.6 per cent) were mainly Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Yersinia spp. One case of Candida albicans (1.1 per cent) was reported. Pasteurella pneumotropica was reported in two cases for the first time. The mortality rate was 4 per cent, mostly from septicemia cases. Long duration of hospitalization (> 10 days) and parenteral feeding were identified as risk factors. Resistance of the isolated pathogens to several commonly used antibiotics was observed. Empirical treatment with antibiotics is recommended only in life-threatening cases.
TI  - On the occurrence of horizontal gene transfer among an arbitrarily chosen group of 26 genes.
AB  - The deduced amino acid sequences from 1200 Haemophilus influenzae genes was compared to a data set that contained the orfs from yeast, two different Archaea and the Gram+ and Gramminus sign bacteria, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli. The results of the comparison yielded a 26 orthologous gene set that had at least one representative from each of the four groups. A four taxa phylogenetic relationship for these 26 genes was determined. The statistical significance of each minimal tree was tested against the two alternative four taxa trees. The result was that four genes significantly supported the (Archaea, Eukaryota) (Gram+, Gramminus sign) topology, two genes supported the one where Gramminus sign and Eukaryota form a clade, and one gene supported the tree where Gram+ and Eukaryota define one clade. The remaining genes do not uniquely support any phylogeny, thereby collapsing the two central nodes into a single node. These are referred to as star phylogenies. I offer a new suggestion for the mechanism that gave rise to the star phylogenies. Namely, these are genes that are younger than the underlying lineages that currently harbor them. This hypothesis is examined with two proteins that display the star phylogeny; namely onithine transcarbamylase and tryptophan synthetase. It is shown, using the distance matrix rate test, that the rate of evolution of these two proteins is comparable to a control gene when rates are determined by comparing closely related species. This implies that the genes under comparison experience comparable functional constraint. However, when the genes from remotely related species are compared, a plateau is encountered. Since we see no unusual levels of functional constraint this plateau cannot be attributed to the divergence of the protein having reached saturation. The simplest explanation is that the genes displaying the star phylogenies were introduced after Archaea, Eukaryota, and Bacteria had diverged from one another. They presumably spread through life by horizontal gene transfer.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxifloxacin against local bacterial isolates.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The emergence of resistance to common antimicrobials in bacteria has been increasingly reported in various countries. Empirical antimicrobial therapy of various infections would therefore need to be reviewed. The introduction of new fluoroquinolones has created an interest in the use of these as possible agents in the empirical treatment of respiratory tract infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the new fluoroquinolone, moxifloxacin, against 400 clinical bacterial isolates was determined by the E-test method. RESULTS: All Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (penicillin sensitive or resistant) were susceptible to moxifloxacin. Similarly, both beta-lactamase and non beta-lactamase producing Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis isolates were susceptible to moxifloxacin. As for Enterobacteriaceae, 88.6% of the isolates tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin with MIC < 8 mg/L, but resistance was noted for some of Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli. Enterococci and Acinetobacter baumannii were resistant to moxifloxacin, whilst the anaerobes tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin. CONCLUSION: Moxifloxacin has good in vitro activity against common organisms associated with community and nosocomial infections, with the exception of enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria. There was good anti-anaerobic activity against Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridum spp. Results of this study are consistent with other similar published in vitro studies.
TI  - Screening of the antibacterial effects of a variety of essential oils on respiratory tract pathogens, using a modified dilution assay method.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the antibacterial effects of a wide variety of essential oils on major respiratory tract pathogens. The antibacterial activity of 14 essential oils and their major components was evaluated by agar-plate dilution assay under sealed conditions, with agar used as a stabilizer for homogeneous dispersion. Of the selected strains of four major bacteria causing respiratory tract infection, Haemophilus influenzae was most susceptible to the essential oils, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Staphylococcus aureus was less susceptible. No cross-resistance was observed between penicillin-sensitive and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae. Escherichia coli, used as a control bacterium, showed the lowest susceptibility. Essential oils containing aldehyde or phenol as a major component showed the highest antibacterial activity, followed by the essential oils containing terpene alcohols. Other essential oils, containing terpene ketone, or ether, had much weaker activity, and an oil containing terpene hydrocarbon was inactive. Based on these findings, thyme (wild, red, and geraniol types), cinnamon bark, lemongrass, perilla, and peppermint oils were selected for further evaluation of their effects on respiratory tract infection.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial activities of cefpiramide and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against 440 clinical isolates in China.
AB  - The in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefpiramide was compared with those of 15  other broad-spectrum cephalosporins. A total of 440 clinical strains of bacteria, including 9 bacterial species, were isolated from our hospital in 1998. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefpiramide and five other antibiotics were determined for each species, using the agar-dilution method. The MIC of cefpiramide for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae was higher than those of three other third-generation cephalosporins, (ie, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone). Fifty-one percent (26/51) of Enterobacter cloacae isolates were resistant to cefpiramide. Cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime had greater activity against E. cloacae (resistance, 3.9% and 19.6%, respectively) than cefpiramide. Cefpiramide was more active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (resistance rates, 12%) than cefoperazone, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, aztreonam, and cefepime. Cefpiramide-resistant P. aeruginosa strains were resistant to ceftazidime, but 27% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were susceptible to cefpiramide; 15.3% of cefpiramide-resistant S. maltophilia strains were also susceptible to ceftazidime, but 50% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were still susceptible to cefpiramide. Cefoperazone/sulbactam was the most active agent against Acinetobacter baumannii, showing a resistance rate of 2%. Ampicillin/sulbactam, ceftazidime, and cefpiramide were the second most active agents, and about 50% of the tested strains were susceptible to these three antibiotics. Cefpiramide had an activity comparable to that of all tested beta-lactams against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 2 microg/ml). Against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, cefpiramide had good activity, with an MIC90 concentration at which 90% of the strain was inhibited of 1 microg/ml and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. These results indicated that cefpiramide was more active against glucose non-fermenting bacteria than against Enterobacteriaceae, and was very active against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylo-coccus aureus, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae. Thus, cefpiramide may be a good choice of drug for the treatment of patients with infections with glucose non-fermenting bacteria and community acquired infections.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity and penetration rate into sputum of gatifloxacin, a novel 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone, and its therapeutic efficacy in respiratory infections.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin against clinical isolates of  pathogenic bacteria was evaluated. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of gatifloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and rifampicin against 20 strains each of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18 strains of Enterobacter cloacae, 15 strains each of Streptococcus Pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis, 12 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 18 strains of Mycobacterium intracellulare, and 22 strains each of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium were determined. The minimum inhibitory concentrations90's of gatifloxacin against the above species were 0.12, 8, <==0.06, 0.5, 2, 2, <==0.06, 0.39, 0.05, 0.013, 2, 0.5, and 4 &mgr;g/ml, respectively. Gatifloxacin was four times as active as ofloxacin against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and as active as ofloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Gatifloxacin was as active as tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae. The antimycobacterial activity of gatifloxacin was similar to that of sparfloxacin. Five patients with chronic respiratory infections and one patient with acute pneumonia received 100-400 mg/day of gatifloxacin orally for 5-12 days (mean, 8.17 days). The clinical effects were excellent in one patient and good in five. One strain of Haemophilus influenzae was eradicated and one strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa persisted after therapy. Adverse reactions were mild and improved after completion of therapy. In one patient with chronic bronchitis, the maximum sputum concentrations 2-4 h after oral administration of 150 mg of gatifloxacin on days 1 and 6 were 0.88 and 1.45 &mgr;g/ml, respectively, and in serum the values were 0.84 and 1.24 &mgr;g/ml, respectively. Thus it was found that gatifloxacin possesses potent activity against respiratory pathogens (including Mycobacteriaceae), and shows good penetration rate into sputum, and that it can be used as the drug of first choice in the treatment of respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Antibodies against homologous microbial caseinolytic proteases P characterise primary biliary cirrhosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Antibodies to caseinolytic protease P(177-194) (ClpP(177-194)) of the proteolytic subunit of the Clp complex of Escherichia coli (E. coli) are uniquely present in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Molecular mimicry between the regulatory subunit ClpX and the principal T-cell epitope of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC-E2) in PBC, has been proposed to account for this. Since ClpP is highly conserved among bacteria we investigated whether the micro-organisms triggering these antibodies may be other than E. coli. METHODS/RESULTS: E. coli ClpP(177-194) is homologous with ClpP peptides of Yersinia enterocolitica (YEREN) and Haemophilus influenzae (HAEIN). Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reactivity to these peptides was tested in 45 patients with PBC, 44 pathological and 32 healthy controls. Reactivity to at least one of the ClpP peptides was observed in 21 (47%) PBC patients, 5.8% pathological and 3.1% healthy controls (P<0.01 for all). Among these 21 seropositive PBC patients, 15 (71%) reacted to ECOLI ClpP(177-194), alone or in association with YEREN and/or HAEIN peptides, compared to three (14.2%) reactive with YEREN, two (9.5%) with YEREN/HAEIN and one (4.7%) with HAEIN peptide. Simultaneous reactivity to homologous sequences was due to cross-reactivity as confirmed by competition ELISAs. CONCLUSIONS: The PBC-specificity of anti-microbial ClpP reactivity is confirmed: the questions as to primary trigger(s) and relevance to PBC pathogenesis remain open.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo interactions of Haemophilus ducreyi with host phagocytes.
AB  - We investigated the phagocytosis of Haemophilus ducreyi both in vitro and in vivo. Human granulocyte and monocyte phagocytosis of opsonized and nonopsonized, fluorescence-labeled H. ducreyi was assessed by flow cytometry. Both Escherichia coli and noncapsulated H. influenzae were included as controls. The maximal percentage of granulocytes taken up by H. ducreyi was 35% after 90 min. In contrast, 95% of H. influenzae bacteria were phagocytosed by granulocytes after 30 min. These results indicated that H. ducreyi phagocytosis was slow and inefficient. Bacterial opsonization by using specific antibodies increased the percentage of granulocytes phagocytosing H. ducreyi from 24 to 49%. The nonphagocytosed bacteria were completely resistant to phagocytosis even when reexposed to granulocytes, indicating that the H. ducreyi culture comprised a mixture of phenotypes. The intracellular survival of H. ducreyi in granulocytes, in monocytes/macrophages, and in a monocyte cell line (THP-1) was quantified after application of gentamicin treatment to kill extracellular bacteria. H. ducreyi survival within phagocytes was poor; approximately 11 and <0.1% of the added bacteria survived intracellularly after 2 and 20 h of incubation, respectively, while no intracellular H. influenzae bacteria were recovered after 2 h of incubation with phagocytes. The role of phagocytes in the development of skin lesions due to H. ducreyi was also studied in vivo. Mice that were depleted of granulocytes and/or monocytes and SCID mice, which lacked T and B cells, were injected intradermally with approximately 10(6) CFU of H. ducreyi. Within 4 days of inoculation, the granulocyte-depleted mice developed lesions that persisted throughout the experimental period. This result reinforces the importance of granulocytes in the early innate defense against H. ducreyi infection. In conclusion, H. ducreyi is insufficiently phagocytosed to achieve complete eradication of the bacteria. Indeed, H. ducreyi has the ability to survive intracellularly for short periods within phagocytic cells in vitro. Since granulocytes play a major role in the innate defense against H. ducreyi infection in vivo, bacterial resistance to phagocytosis probably plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of chancroid.
TI  - Assessment of BMS284756 MIC and 5-microg disk diffusion quality control studies tested against seven American type culture collection strains.
AB  - BMS284756 is a novel des-fluoro(6)-quinolone with antimicrobial activity similar  to recently developed fluorinated quinolones. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the appropriate disk diffusion and MIC quality control (QC) ranges for BMS284756 when used against commonly tested QC strains (M23-A2). The BMS284756 5-microg disk content was tested against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Hemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. In addition, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and S. aureus ATCC 29213 were evaluated by the broth microdilution method. Seven laboratories tested 2 disk lots on 3 agar media or 3-4 broth lots over a 10 day period. A total of 420 zone diameter values and 210 or 280 MIC values per organism were generated. The following disk diffusion and MIC QC ranges were suggested for BMS284756 and the seven QC strains: E. coli ATCC 25922 (28-35 mm/0.004-0.016 microg/mL), E. faecalis ATCC 29212 (0.03-0.25 microg/mL), S. aureus ATCC 25923 (30-36 mm), S. aureus ATCC 29213 (0.004-0.016 microg/mL), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (19-25 mm/0.5-2 microg/mL), H. influenzae ATCC 49247 (33-41 mm/0.002-0.008 microg/mL), S. pneumoniae ATCC (26-33 mm/0.016-0.06 microg/mL). The proportion of participant results observed within the proposed ranges was 97.4-98.8% and 94.6-100% for the disk diffusion and MIC tests, respectively.
TI  - Active copper- and zinc-containing superoxide dismutase in the cryptic genospecies of Haemophilus causing urogenital and neonatal infections discriminates them from Haemophilus influenzae sensu stricto.
AB  - The presence of active copper- and zinc-containing superoxide dismutase in isolates of the cryptic genospecies of Haemophilus, responsible for urogenital, neonatal, and mother-infant infections, can be used as a biochemical marker to discriminate them from H. influenzae sensu stricto strains.
TI  - Ertapenem: a new carbapenem.
AB  - Ertapenem is a new 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase, which binds preferable to penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) 2 and 3. Ertapenem has a broad antibacterial spectrum with MIC90 values < 0.5 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Proteus spp., Clostridium perfringens, Fusobacterium spp. Peptostreptococcus spp. and anaerobic Streptococcus spp. Ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action as shown by time-killing curves and exhibits a short PAE of 1.4 - 2.6 h against the Gram-positive strains but no PAE against Gram-negative strains. In an infection model in mice, it has been shown that ertapenem and imipenem were highly efficacious at a level of 2 mg/kg in bacterial clearance in comparison to ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefotaxime and meropenem. In comparison to other available carbapenems, ertapenem has a long half-life of 4.5 h and is developed as a single daily dose carbapenem. The protein binding is dose-dependent and is estimated to 94% at concentrations under 100 mg/l and approximately 85% at 300 mg/l. Cmax after a dose of 1 g in healthy volunteers has been estimated to 190 mg/l. Given the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, it may be predicted that ertapenem will have an effect on most Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp. and Acinetobacter spp. For pathogens with a MIC of 0.5 mg/l, the estimated T > MIC will be 50% (of 24 h) and for pathogens with a MIC of 1 mg/l 31%. For anaerobic bacteria with MIC values between 1-2 mg/l, the T > MIC may not be sufficient for bacterial eradication. However, clinical trials have to confirm this hypothesis.
TI  - [Study on regulation of long-chain fatty acid metabolism with the use of computer analysis of complete bacterial genomes].
AB  - One of the main trends in the prokaryote genomics is the comparative analysis of  metabolic pathways. This method can be used for the analysis of experimentally studied systems of co-regulated genes, as well as genes with unknown regulatory signals. In this study we apply the comparative analysis of regulatory signals to the genes of the enzymes for fatty acid metabolism from Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Vibrio cholerae, Yersinia pestis. Transcription of these genes is regulated by the FadR protein. We describe the FadR regulation of the long-chain fatty acid oxidation and partially that of the fatty acid biosynthesis. We also demonstrate that the gene yafH encoding acyl-CoA dehydrogenase is identical to the gene fadE, previously identified by genetic techniques.
TI  - [The trend of childhood bacterial meningitis in Japan (1997.7-2000.6)].
AB  - We surveyed the epidemiology of purulent meningitis in pediatrics for 3 years between July 1997 and June 2000 in Japan and obtained the following results. The number of cases of purulent meningitis was 428, which was equivalent of 1.1-1.7 children out of 1,000 hospitalized those in pediatrics per year. The age-distribution for the infections was the highest under 1 year of age and it decreased as the age increased. Under 1 year of age, the highest distribution was observed in one month of age and under 1 month of age, the highest distribution was observed in 7 days of or younger ages. Haemophilus influenzae was the most common pathogen causing the infections, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae, group B streptococcus, and Escherichia coli. Relationship between causing pathogens and age-distribution was as follows: group B streptococcus and E. coli were major pathogens under 4 months of age and H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae were major pathogens over 3 months of age. Susceptibility tests performed at each facility demonstrated that 25.3% of H. influenzae isolates and 38.7% of S. pneumoniae isolates were drug-resistant. Analysis of resistant genes for H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae isolates, which were stored and sent, demonstrated higher rates of resistance than those observed in susceptibility tests. These results suggest that the increase in insufficient efficacy of usual treatment with combination of ampicillin and cefotaxime is predictable against the infections. Therefore, the treatment for the infections should be reconsidered.
TI  - In vivo expression of Neisseria meningitidis proteins homologous to the Haemophilus influenzae Hap and Hia autotransporters.
AB  - The genome sequences of Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B strain MC58 and serogroup A strain Z2491 were systematically searched for open reading frames (ORFs) encoding autotransporters. Eight ORFs were identified, six of which were present in both genomes, whereas two were specific for MC58. Among the identified ORFs was the gene encoding the known autotransporter IgA1 protease. The deduced amino acid sequences of the other identified ORFs were homologous to known autotransporters and found to contain an N-terminal signal sequence and a C-terminal domain that could constitute a beta-barrel in the outer membrane. The ORFs NMB1985 and NMB0992, encoding homologs of the Hap (for Haemophilus adhesion and penetration protein) and Hia (for Haemophilus influenzae adherence protein) autotransporters of H. influenzae, were cloned from serogroup B strain H44/76 and expressed in Escherichia coli. Western blots revealed that all sera of patients (n=14) and healthy carriers (n=3) tested contained antibodies against at least one of the recombinant proteins. These results indicate that both genes are widely distributed among N. meningitidis isolates and expressed during colonization and infection.
TI  - Design and construction of a Haemophilus influenzae conjugal expression system.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae is a fastidious Gram-negative coccobacilli that is a common commensal in the human upper respiratory tract. However, certain strains of this bacterium, including those considered to be nontypeable (NTHi), can cause human diseases ranging from otitis media to meningitis. Although naturally competent, NTHi take up plasmids by transformation very inefficiently, if at all. Many clinical isolates have also proven refractory to the introduction of currently available shuttle vectors via electroporation. Further, it has been difficult to determine protein expression from these vectors, unless specific antisera has been raised or a phenotype conferred. To address these problems, we have designed and constructed a set of broad host range vectors that are transferable via intergeneric conjugation with an Escherichia coli strain carrying chromosomally-encoded transfer functions. These vectors provide a site for cloning promoter::MCS regions and carry genes encoding resistance to one of two different antibiotics. This conjugal system allows the expression of marker genes in NTHi strains, enabling researchers to track the microbe's progress either in vivo using the infant rat model of infection, or in vitro through invasions of human tissue culture cell lines.
TI  - Postantibiotic effects of eleven antimicrobials on five bacteria.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the postantibiotic effects (PAE) of different classes of antimicrobials against five different types of bacteria. METHODS: Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined by twofold macrodilution in broth. The antimicrobial agents were eliminated by washing method after the bacteria were exposed to antimicrobials for 1 h or 2 h. Growth curves were followed by viable counts, and then the PAE were calculated. RESULTS: Macrolides induced PAE of 3.10 h to 4.15 h on S aureus, and 1.85 h to 3.3 h against S pneumoniae, which were longer than PAE induced by other tested antimicrobials (P<0.01). Macrolides induced PAE of 1 h to 4 h against H influenzae, with azithromycin producing the longest PAE of 4 h. Ciprofloxacin and amikacin induced PAE of 1.38 h to 2.00 h on E coli and K pneumoniae, which were longer than that of beta-lactams, piperacillin, cefazolin, or cefotaxime, with PAE of 0.1 h to 0.5 h (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Different classes of antimicrobials induce different periods of PAE. As an important pharmacodynamic parameter, PAE provide reference data for the determination of the optimal dosing regimen and reasonable use of antimicrobials.
TI  - Prevention and management of infection in children with sickle cell anaemia.
AB  - Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) predisposes a child to infections for various reasons,  including increased bone marrow turnover, poor perfusion and functional asplenia leading to decreased opsonisation of polysaccharide encapsulated organisms. Bacteria and viruses that most frequently cause serious infections in children with sickle cell disease are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, parvovirus B19 and hepatitis A, B and C viruses. Penicillin prophylaxis has decreased the incidence of infection-related morbidity and mortality significantly in children with SCA. Children <3 years of age are administered oral penicillin 125mg twice daily, and the dose is increased to 250mg twice daily for the >3 to 5 year age group. Adherence to the penicillin prophylactic regimen is recommended for children with SCA who are >5 years of age. For children with SCA who have recurrent invasive pneumococcal infections, an effort is made to keep the child on penicillin prophylaxis indefinitely. The administration of various childhood vaccines has also made an appreciable impact on the overall morbidity and mortality associated with infection in children with SCA. The administration of the heptavalent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (PCV7) has provided control of invasive pneumococcal infections, and the prophylactic use of the H. influenzae type b conjugate vaccine has reduced the incidence of septicaemia and meningitis caused by this organism. Other vaccines used prophylactically in children with SCA include hepatitis A and B, and vaccines against influenza and varicella viruses. The immediate administration of intravenous antibacterials, after appropriate blood and urine cultures, is of great importance in the treatment of the febrile child with SCA. Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime have been recommended for the treatment of septic episodes in SCA associated with S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus and Salmonella spp. Infection with Yersinia enterocolitica may be treated with cefotaxime or an aminoglycoside. The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in SCA is unknown. Effective therapies include metronidazole, tetracycline or amoxicillin. Parvovirus infections require supportive care and specific antiviral therapy is not indicated. The judicious use of antimicrobials is encouraged in view of the worldwide emergence of multidrug-resistant strains. The long term sequelae associated with infections in children with SCA can be decreased with the implementation of immunisation programmes and effective and prompt treatment with appropriate antibacterials.
TI  - A study on community acquired pneumonia in adults requiring hospital admission in Penang.
AB  - A study was carried out to determine the pattern of microbiological organisms causing community acquired pneumonia in adult patients admitted to Penang Hospital between November 1999 and August 2000. Altogether, 98 patients (64 males, 34 females) with a mean age (+/- S.D.) of 55.9 (+/- 19.0) (range 15 to 87) years were included in the study. Causative organisms were identified in 42 patients (42.9%). Mycobacterium tuberculosis was the commonest pathogen being identified in 15.3% of cases, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.1%) and Staphylococcus aureus (5.1%). Streptococcus pneumoniae and Acinetobacter spp accounted for 3 cases each (3.1%) and Haemophilus influenzae, non-haemolytic Streptococcus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp and Pseudomonas spp for 1 case each (1.0%). Four patients (4.1%) had dual infections and no case of legionella pneumonia was found in this series.
TI  - Cloning of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli phage VT-2 dam methyltransferase.
AB  - Enterobacterial GATC-specific DNA adenine methyltransferase (Dam) plays an essential role in regulation of DNA replication, methyl-directed mismatch repair, transposition and gene expression. In Salmonella typhimurium it has been shown to directly control virulence. In this paper we report cloning and expression of the dam gene from the Shiga toxin-producing VT2-Sa prophage of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157. Comparisons of the predicted amino acid sequence indicates that Dam methyltransferases of E. coli phages VT2-Sa, 933W, T1 and Haemophilus influenzae phage HP1 make up a separate subgroup of adenine-N6 methyltransferases. These proteins are similar to the gamma subfamily of amino-methyltransferases in respect to the linear order of sequence motifs and the presence of the hallmark "NPPY" tetrapeptide. However, they apparently lack an autonomous target-recognizing domain at the C-terminus of the catalytic domain and therefore we propose to dub them as a "mini-gamma" subfamily.
TI  - Redox signal transduction by the ArcB sensor kinase of Haemophilus influenzae lacking the PAS domain.
AB  - The Arc (anoxic redox control) two-component signal transduction system of Escherichia coli, which comprises the tripartite ArcB sensor kinase and the ArcA response regulator, modulates the expression of numerous operons in response to redox conditions of growth. We demonstrate that the arcA and arcB genes of Haemophilus influenzae specify a two-component system. The Arc proteins of the two bacterial species sufficiently resemble each other that they can participate in heterologous transphosphorylation in vitro. Moreover, the Arc system of H. influenzae mediates transcriptional control according to the redox condition of growth both autologously in its own host and homologously in E. coli, indicating a high degree of functional conservation of the signal transduction system. The H. influenzae ArcB, however, lacks the PAS domain present in the region of E. coli ArcB linking the transmembrane to the cytosolic catalytic domains. Because the PAS domain participates in signal reception in a variety of sensory proteins, including sensors of molecular oxygen and redox state, a similar role was previously ascribed to it in ArcB. Our results demonstrate that the ArcB protein of H. influenzae mediates signal transduction in response to redox conditions of growth despite the absence of the PAS domain.
TI  - Frequency of isolation and antimicrobial resistance of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria from patients in intensive care units of 25 European university hospitals participating in the European arm of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program 1997-1998.
AB  - A total of 3,981 isolates from patients treated at intensive care units were collected in 25 European university hospitals during 1997 and 1998 as part of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program. Overall, the most important species isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis. Thirty-nine percent of all Staphylococcus aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. All Staphylococcus aureus isolates were fully susceptible to linezolid and vancomycin. Moreover, all CNS isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and minocycline. All Enterococcus faecalis isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, and 99% of these isolates were also susceptible to ampicillin. The antimicrobial agents most effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were amikacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem, and cefepime, with 87, 85, 84, and 83% of isolates being susceptible, respectively. Escherichia coli isolates were fully susceptible to carbapenems, and at least 99% of these isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone, cefepime, and amikacin. The Enterobacter spp. were also highly susceptible to carbapenems, amikacin, and cefepime, with 99, 97, and 96% of isolates being susceptible, respectively. Haemophilus influenzae was susceptible to most of the antibiotics tested. Only 68% of the pneumococcal isolates were fully susceptible to penicillin, yet 100% were susceptible to a number of fluoroquinolones and vancomycin. There are still sufficient treatment options for patients infected with the most important bacterial species involved in infections in intensive care units. However, the situation for patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections is critical.
TI  - A MATE family multidrug efflux transporter pumps out fluoroquinolones in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron.
AB  - We cloned a gene, bexA, that codes for a multidrug efflux transporter from the chromosomal DNA of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron ATCC 29741 by using an Escherichia coli DeltaacrAB DeltaacrEF mutant as a host. Although the initial recombinant construct contained other open reading frames, the presence of bexA alone was sufficient to confer to the E. coli host elevated levels of resistance to norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ethidium bromide. Disruption of bexA in B. thetaiotaomicron made the strain more susceptible to norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ethidium bromide, showing that this gene is expressed in this organism and functions as a multidrug efflux pump. The deduced BexA protein sequence was homologous to the protein sequence of Vibrio parahaemolyticus NorM, a multidrug efflux transporter, and thus, BexA belongs to the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family.
TI  - Computer modeling of small heat-shock metalloprotease of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax.
AB  - We present here computer generated model of N-terminal fragment, amino acids (aa) 36-245, of a Plasmodium vivax heat shock metalloprotease called PVHSP28, whose gene was cloned and characterised earlier. The fragment showed homology with HSPs from many organisms, including Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae. PVHSP28 had the signature sequence 'HEXXH' and 'EXXXD' of Zinc metalloproteases. Being the first malarial HSP possessing metalloprotease activity, PVHSP28 is an ideal target for the design of new anti-malarial drugs. However, except for a small region (aa 62-132) which had 24.6% sequence similarity with 1TAQ (a DNA polymerase), it did not show sequence similarity with any published structures in protein data bank. Hence it could not be modelled using any automated modeling programs. We modelled 36-245 aa of PVHSP28 using predicted secondary structure as well as experimentally determined and predicted properties of the protein on the basis of its amino acid sequence, using various Internet tools and in-house package MODEL. The model was energy minimised using Sander's module of AMBER 5.0, working on a Silicon Graphics machine, with all atom force field.
TI  - Mechanism-related changes in the gene transcription and protein synthesis patterns of Haemophilus influenzae after treatment with transcriptional and translational inhibitors.
AB  - High-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of pulse-labeled Haemophilus  influenzae extracts allows for the separation and quantification of more than five hundred protein spots. We have determined the changes in the protein synthesis patterns triggered by treatment with inhibitors of transcription, Rifampicin (Rif) and translation, Chloramphenicol (Chl), Erythromycin (Ery), Fusidate (Fus), Puromycin (Pur), Kanamycin (Kan), Streptomycin (Str), and Tetracycline (Tet) relative to the total protein synthesis rate. More than 200 spots changed in intensity under at least one condition. With the exception of the aminoglycosides, Kan and Str, all inhibitors triggered a clear increase in the synthesis rates of ribosomal proteins and RNA polymerase subunits. Northern analysis of rpoA, rpoB, rpoC, and six ribosomal protein genes indicated induction of transcription as well as antitermination as part of the mechanism of the regulation of gene expression. Total RNA synthesis was increased after exposure to Chl, Ery, Fus, and Tet, whereas Str had no effect. Rif led to an almost complete shutdown of RNA synthesis. Exposure to Chl, Ery, Fus, Rif, and Tet resulted in a decrease in the concentration of the stringent factor, guanosine 5',3'-bis-diphosphate (ppGpp) whereas Str again had no effect. Thus, as in Escherichia coli, the response of H. influenzae to translational inhibitors appears to be mediated by the regulatory nucleotide ppGpp.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of five quinolone antibiotics, including gemifloxacin, against clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, norfloxacin, levofloxacin and gemifloxacin against 343 clinical isolates were compared. Gemifloxacin showed the greatest activity, with MIC90 values as low as 0.03-0.25 mg/L against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae, while methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli and Enterobacter spp. strains exhibited low rates of susceptibility to all five fluoroquinolones.
TI  - DNA as a nutrient: novel role for bacterial competence gene homologs.
AB  - The uptake and stable maintenance of extracellular DNA, genetic transformation, is universally recognized as a major force in microbial evolution. We show here that extracellular DNA, both homospecific and heterospecific, can also serve as the sole source of carbon and energy supporting microbial growth. Mutants unable to consume DNA suffer a significant loss of fitness during stationary-phase competition. In Escherichia coli, the use of DNA as a nutrient depends on homologs of proteins involved in natural genetic competence and transformation in Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Homologs of these E. coli genes are present in many members of the gamma subclass of Proteobacteria, suggesting that the mechanisms for consumption of DNA may have been widely conserved during evolution.
TI  - Characterization of pEC156, a ColE1-type plasmid from Escherichia coli E1585-68 that carries genes of the EcoVIII restriction-modification system.
AB  - The complete 4312-bp sequence of the pEC156 plasmid from Escherichia coli E1585-68, which carries genes encoding the EcoVIII restriction-modification (R-M) system, an isoschizomer of HindIII from Haemophilus influenzae, has been determined. Two clustered and convergently oriented open reading frames, large enough to encode genes of the EcoVIII R-M system, were found. The transcriptional start points were mapped by the primer extension method. The relative molecular masses of the EcoVIII endonuclease and EcoVIII methyltransferase deduced from the nucleotide sequence are 35,554 and 33,910, respectively. Nucleotide sequence analysis of pEC156 suggests that this plasmid is a ColE1-type replicon. It consists of an origin of replication and two untranslated genes encoding RNA I and RNA II, both involved in the regulation of plasmid DNA replication. The replication region also contains the gene encoding a 64-aa Rom-like protein. Inactivation of the putative rom gene by insertion of a kanamycin-resistance cassette resulted in 4.5-fold increase in pEC156-derived plasmid copy number in E. coli cells. All of these elements (RNA I, RNA II, and rom) reveal a high level of similarity to ColE1 homologs. The replication of all ColE1-type plasmids is dependent on the activity of E. coli DNA polymerase I. It was shown that a pEC156 derivative (pIB8) carrying an antibiotic resistance gene indeed failed to replicate in an E. coli polA12(ts) mutant at 43 degrees C, and its copy number was reduced in the E. coli pcnB80 mutant. These results prove that pEC156 is a ColE1-type replicon.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of ertapenem (MK-0826), a long-acting carbapenem, tested against selected resistant strains.
AB  - Ertapenem (MK-0826) is a novel, long-acting parenteral carbapenem. The purpose of this in vitro study was to test ertapenem's activity against a collection of multiply-resistant strains of gram-positive and -negative bacteria isolated from locations worldwide, and to examine its bactericidal activity and ability to act in a synergistic manner in combination with other antimicrobial agents. Ertapenem was active against a variety of gram-negative pathogens, with particular potency noted for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC90s < or =0.015-0.5 microg/mL) including extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains. Less ertapenem activity was seen against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, especially ceftazidime-resistant strains (MIC50 16 microg/mL). Except for enterococci, ertapenem was active against most gram-positive species, including beta-haemolytic streptococci (MIC90 0.03 microg/mL; 100% susceptible), viridans group streptococci (MIC90 2 microg/mL; 98.1% susceptible), and penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 < or =0.015 microg/mL; 100% susceptible). Ertapenem was also very potent against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 0.25 microg/mL; 100% susceptible). Bactericidal action was observed versus staphylococci, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae, and at least an additive effect was detected against the majority of the strains tested when ertapenem was combined with ciprofloxacin or gentamicin. These results from testing 902 organisms indicate that ertapenem appears to be a promising broad-spectrum carbapenem with a possible role against some emerging resistant species.
TI  - Novel method for enzymatic synthesis of CMP-NeuAc.
AB  - A novel method for synthesizing CMP-NeuAc was established. We first confirmed that the putative neuA gene of Haemophilus influenzae, identified by its whole genome sequence project, indeed encodes CMP-NeuAc synthetase (EC 2.7.7.43). The enzyme requires CTP as a cytidylyl donor for cytidylylation of NeuAc. The enzyme was coupled with an enzymatic CTP-generating system from CMP and inorganic polyphosphate as a sole phospho-donor driven by the combination of polyphosphate kinase and CMP kinase, where phosphorylation of CMP is done by the combined activity expressed by both enzymes, and subsequent phosphorylation of CDP by polyphosphate kinase itself occurred efficiently. When CMP-NeuAc synthetase of H. influenzae, polyphosphate kinase, and CMP kinase were added to the reaction mixture containing equimolar concentrations (15 mM) of CMP and NeuAc, and polyphosphate (150 mM in terms of phosphate), CMP-NeuAc was synthesized up to 10 mM in 67% yield.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of GAR-936 tested against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive blood stream infection isolates and strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  - GAR-936, a new, semisynthetic glycylcycline, has shown good antibacterial activity against a wide range of clinically important Gram-positive and -negative aerobic bacteria including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, most Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp. The purpose of this study was to determine the activity of GAR-936 against a range of Gram-positive and -negative bloodstream isolates including many strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). Six hundred four bloodstream isolates of Gram-positive cocci collected as part of the SENTRY surveillance program were selected for their geographic diversity. GAR-936 was also tested against an additional 176 Gram-negative cocci isolates (Klebsiella pneumoniae, 98 strains; Escherichia coli, 78 strains), 96 of which were ESBL-producers. Broth microdilution testing was used to determine the susceptibility of the selected organisms and a range of comparator antimicrobial agents whose choice was based on their activities against the selected pathogens and included a mix of both newer and older agents. Presence of an ESBL-producing strain was confirmed using the clavulanate test. GAR-936 demonstrated impressive activity against all 604 strains of Gram-positive cocci, with an MIC range of <or=0.015-1 microg/mL, and MIC(90)s ranging from <or=0.05 microg/mL for S. pneumoniae to 0.25 for S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. MICs against the 176 Gram-negative isolates were higher (range 0.06-4 microg/mL), with MIC(90)s of 0.25-1 microg/mL. The activity of GAR-936 was relatively unaffected by the presence of ESBLs. The activity of GAR-936 was particularly impressive against Gram-positive cocci when compared against the test results for vancomycin and the newer antimicrobial agents, linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin. The MIC(90)s for GAR-936 were significantly lower than the comparator agents for all species tested with particularly impressive results against S. pneumoniae and enterococci.
TI  - The WHO Vaccine Trial Registry.
AB  - The WHO Vaccine Trial Registry prospectively registers clinical vaccine studies supported by WHO. Through December 1999, the registry includes 103 studies from 43 countries, with nearly 80% in developing countries. The registry documents an expanding research capacity, with an average of 3.9 new studies per year during 1987-1993, rising to 10.7 per year during 1994-2000. The studies concern a broad spectrum of infectious organisms, including: Clostridium tetani (tetanus), dengue virus, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), hepatitis B virus, measles virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus), poliovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rotavirus, Salmonella typhi, Shigella, Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), and Vibrio cholerae.
TI  - Expression of the Pasteurella multocida ompH gene is negatively regulated by the  Fur protein.
AB  - The fur gene of Pasteurella multocida has been cloned by complementation of an Escherichia coli fur mutant. The P. multocida fur gene, which encodes a predicted protein of 147 amino acids, displaying the highest identity (89%) with the same protein of Haemophilus influenzae, is negatively regulated by its own product. By construction of a P. multocida fur mutant, it has been demonstrated that the ompH gene, encoding a major structural protein of the outer membrane, presenting high antigenicity power, is negatively regulated by iron and glucose. Furthermore, wild-type and fur-defective cells of P. multocida show the same level of virulence.
TI  - Comparison of the methylene blue and toluidine blue photobactericidal efficacy against gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Studies on the photobactericidal efficacy of methylene  blue (MB) and toluidine blue (TB) have shown inconsistent results in the literature. This study evaluated the bactericidal efficacy of MB and TB against different bacteria under light and dark conditions to determine the most effective bactericidal dye. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Suspensions of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Hemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in saline were treated in dark and red laser light conditions in the presence of each dye using an argon pumped-dye and a diode laser emitting light at 630 and 664 nm, respectively. The effect of dye concentration, dark incubation time, the fluence and intensity of laser light on the destruction of different bacteria were compared. RESULTS: Both dyes eradicated all examined bacteria under laser light. The complete photodestruction of microorganisms was reached at TB concentrations of 1.5-7-fold less than that of MB. CONCLUSION: TB exhibits a greater bactericidal activity than MB against most bacteria in dark and light conditions. Mostly, these results are consistent with their respective dye partition coefficients.
TI  - Regulation of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in gamma-proteobacteria.
AB  - Computational comparative techniques were applied to analysis of the aromatic amino acid regulons in gamma-proteobacteria. This resulted in characterization of the TrpR and TyrR regulons in the genomes of Yersinia pestis, Haemophilus influenzae, Vibrio cholerae and other bacteria and identification of new members of the PhhR regulon in the genome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Candidate attenuators were constructed for all studied genomes, including the trpBA operon of the very distantly related bacterium Chlamidia trachomatis. The pheA attenuator of Y. pestis is an integration site for the insertion element IS-200. It was shown that the triplication of the DAHP-synthase genes occurred prior to the divergence of families Enterobacteriaceae, Vibrionaceae and Alteromonadaceae. The candidate allosteric control site of the DAHP-syntheases was identified. This site is deteriorated in AroH of Buchnera sp. APS. The known DAHP-synthase of Bordetella pertussis is likely to be feedback-inhibited by phenylalanine, and the DAHP-synthase of Corynebacterium glutamicum could be inhibited by tyrosine. Overall, the most extensive regulation was observed in Escherichia coli, whereas the regulation in other genomes seems to be less developed. At the extreme, the tryptophan production in the aphid endosymbiont Buchnera sp. APS is free from transcriptional, attenuation, and allosteric control.
TI  - Identification and characterization of App: an immunogenic autotransporter protein of Neisseria meningitidis.
AB  - In a search for immunogenic virulence factors in Neisseria meningitidis, we have  identified a gene encoding a predicted 160 kDa protein with homology to the autotransporter family of proteins. Members of this family are secreted or surface exposed and are often associated with virulence in Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. We named the gene adhesion and penetration protein (app), because of its extensive homology to the hap gene of Haemophilus influenzae. We reconstructed the gene with reference to genomic sequence data and cloned and expressed the protein in Escherichia coli. Rabbit antiserum raised against recombinant App reacted with proteins in all meningococcal isolates examined, which represented clonal groups responsible for the majority of meningococcal invasive disease. Antibodies to the protein were detected in the sera of patients convalescing from meningococcal infection. Purified App had strong stimulating activity for T cells isolated from a number of healthy donors and from one convalescent patient. We confirmed that App is surface localized, cleaved and secreted by N. meningitidis. Importantly, the rabbit anti-App serum killed the organism in the presence of complement. Thus, App is conserved among meningococci, immunogenic in humans and potentially involved in virulence. It therefore merits further investigation as a component of a future multivalent vaccine.
TI  - Genetic analysis of virulence factors of Mannheimia (Pasteurella) haemolytica A1.
AB  - Using a molecular genetic approach, the genes that code for the various virulence factors of Mannheimia haemolytica A1 have been cloned for detailed characterizations. These included analysis of the encoded proteins, their biological activities, secretion of the molecules from the bacterium as well as their use in a vaccine component. Two newly characterized antigens of M. haemolytica A1 have been identified. The first one is a TonB-dependent iron regulated outer-membrane receptor that is distinct from the transferrin binding proteins. The 84kDa Irp protein exhibits features including a TonB box and a 50 amino acid region that can adopt occluded beta-barrel structures similar to the "plug" domain of the Escherichia coli FhuA and FepA crystal structures. Homologues of Irp were identified by analysis of the genome sequences of a number of Gram negative mucosal pathogens, including Neisseria meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae. The Neisserial irp genes were cloned by PCR and expressed the 84kDa protein as expected, demonstrating that they are functional genes. In addition to being regulated by iron and Fur, irp(Mh) undergoes phase variation by a slipped-strand mispairing mechanism and may represent a contingency locus for iron acquisition during an infection. Another locus that codes for a putative adhesin molecule has also been partially characterized. This putative adhesin protein is highly homologous with the high-molecular-weight adhesin proteins of non-piliated non-typable strains of Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) including Hia, Hsf, HMW1, HMW2. Currently, we have cloned the DNA that codes for 2223 amino acids (225kDa) and is still missing the stop codon. It is anticipated that when complete, the protein could be close to 240kDa, similar to the molecular mass of Hsf. Though incomplete, analysis of the adhesin showed that it exhibits characteristics of autotransporter (AT) proteins. The role of this high-molecular-weight adhesin in infection is being investigated.
TI  - Multi-resistance to antimicrobial agents for the ten most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Cross-resistance and multi-resistance to selected antibiotics was determined for  Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Amikacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae often showed cross-resistance to ss-lactam antibiotics. Only 1% of the Escherichia coli isolates showed resistance to more than four antibiotics from a set of seven. This rate was higher for other Enterobacteriaceae and there were high levels of cross-resistance for P. aeruginosa. The cross-resistance of oxacillin with other antibiotics is well known in staphylococci. Penicillin-resistant pneumococcal isolates were cross-resistant to macrolides. Cross-resistance was only a minor problem in H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. Cross- and multi-resistance are important problems for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria but not for fastidious bacteria with the exception of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a high-affinity zinc uptake system in Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  - A search of the gonococcal genome database using the known zinc-binding protein (znuA) sequences from Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae identified an open reading frame encoding a putative gonococcal ZnuA. The consensus amino acid sequence of this open reading frame possessed a characteristic 30-amino acid histidine-rich metal-binding motif (repetitive HDH sequence) containing 43% histidine and 37% aspartic acid and glutamic acid. Subsequently, two adjacent open reading frames with homology to E. coli and H. influenzae znuB and znuC were located upstream of znuA. When partially purified from sonicated cell-free supernatants by CM-Sepharose chromatography, the mature gonococcal ZnuA had an estimated molecular mass of 38 kDa by SDS-PAGE. The presence of a DNA sequence encoding a 19-amino acid signal peptide and the solubility of the mature ZnuA suggested that this protein was located in the periplasm. Inactivation of the Neisseria gonorrhoeae F62 znuA by insertional mutagenesis resulted in a mutant that had a growth rate lower than that of the wild-type parent strain and that required high concentrations of ZnCl2 (> or = 200 microM) for optimal growth. Using a chemically defined agar medium, the gonococcal ZnuA mutant grew only in the presence of Zn(2+), whereas Mg(2+), Ca(2+), Ni(2+), Fe(2+), Cu(2+), Mn(2+) and Cd(2+) had either no effect or were growth inhibitory.
TI  - Protein D expression promotes the adherence and internalization of non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae into human monocytic cells.
AB  - Protein D, having a glycerol-3-phosphodiester phosphodiesterase activity, is found at the surface of all Haemophilus influenzae strains and is a possible virulence factor. In the present study, the involvement of protein D in the entry of NTHi into human monocytic cells is reported. Primary monocytes and the monocytic cell lines U-937 and THP-1 were infected with NTHi strain 772 and the mutant 772 Delta hpd 1 (lacking the gene for protein D). NTHi 772 adhered to and entered monocytic cells up to four-fold more efficiently compared to 772 Delta hpd 1. When an Escherichia coli transformant expressing protein D was incubated with monocytic cells, the number of intracellular bacteria increased 1.6-fold compared to protein D-deficient controls. Any correlation between internalization and phosphorylcholine expression was not detected. In conclusion, our data suggest that surface-expressed protein D promotes the adherence of NTHi to human monocytes leading to a higher number of internalized bacteria.
TI  - [Profile of bacterial isolates and antimicrobial susceptibility: Multicenter study using a one-day cut-off].
AB  - The frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial isolates from the largest clinical samples collected in 19 Spanish hospitals were studied. A total of 523 strains were identified and grouped by sample. Blood stream: Staphylococcus coagulase-negative (41%) and Escherichia coli (19.7%); oxacillin resistance occurred in 44% of coagulase-negative strains, strains which were also resistant to nonbetalactam agents. All antimicrobial agents tested had good activity against E. coli, with the exception of penicillins (25 to 33% susceptible). Urine: E. coli (59.1%) and Enterococcus faecalis (15%); aminoglycosides and third generation cephalosporins were the most active compounds against E. coli, whereas penicillins and cotrimoxazole were the least active. E. faecalis isolates showed low rates of resistance to the antibiotics tested and no glycopeptide-resistant strains were detected. Skin and soft tissues: Staphylococcus aureus (24.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.7.%); oxacillin resistance occurred in 15.8% of S. aureus strains and co-resistance to nonbetalactam agents was frequently observed among these strains. Ceftazidime susceptibility was elevated among P. aeruginosa (76.9%) and the most active agents were aminoglycosides (100% susceptibility). Lower respiratory tract: P. aeruginosa (21.4%) and Haemophilus influenzae (15.5%). Aminoglycosides (88.8 to 94.4%) and ceftazidime (72%) presented the highest susceptibility rates in P. aeruginosa. All the agents tested were very active against H. influenzae (89% susceptibility). Among Gram-positive cocci, no vancomycin and/or teicoplanin-resistant strains were detected.
TI  - The role of efflux in macrolide resistance.
AB  - Efflux is one of the major resistance mechanisms for macrolide antibiotics observed in both laboratory and clinical settings. This review summarizes the recent research on two major macrolide efflux pumps: Mef in Gram-positive organisms and Acr-AB-TolC in Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli. The roles of pumps in macrolide resistance and the new advances / strategies to overcome efflux are discussed. Copyright 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.
TI  - Characterizations of highly expressed genes of four fast-growing bacteria.
AB  - Predicted highly expressed (PHX) genes are characterized for the completely sequenced genomes of the four fast-growing bacteria Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Vibrio cholerae, and Bacillus subtilis. Our approach to ascertaining gene expression levels relates to codon usage differences among certain gene classes: the collection of all genes (average gene), the ensemble of ribosomal protein genes, major translation/transcription processing factors, and genes for polypeptides of chaperone/degradation complexes. A gene is predicted highly expressed (PHX) if its codon frequencies are close to those of the ribosomal proteins, major translation/transcription processing factor, and chaperone/degradation standards but strongly deviant from the average gene codon frequencies. PHX genes identified by their codon usage frequencies among prokaryotic genomes commonly include those for ribosomal proteins, major transcription/translation processing factors (several occurring in multiple copies), and major chaperone/degradation proteins. Also PHX genes generally include those encoding enzymes of essential energy metabolism pathways of glycolysis, pyruvate oxidation, and respiration (aerobic and anaerobic), genes of fatty acid biosynthesis, and the principal genes of amino acid and nucleotide biosyntheses. Gene classes generally not PHX include most repair protein genes, virtually all vitamin biosynthesis genes, genes of two-component sensor systems, most regulatory genes, and most genes expressed in stationary phase or during starvation. Members of the set of PHX aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase genes contrast sharply between genomes. There are also subtle differences among the PHX energy metabolism genes between E. coli and B. subtilis, particularly with respect to genes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The good agreement of PHX genes of E. coli and B. subtilis with high protein abundances, as assessed by two-dimensional gel determination, is verified. Relationships of PHX genes with stoichiometry, multifunctionality, and operon structures are also examined. The spatial distribution of PHX genes within each genome reveals clusters and significantly long regions without PHX genes.
TI  - [Comparison of types and drug sensitivity of bacteria isolated from sputum and bronchoscopic material. Analysis of results from routine diagnostic tests from 1995-1997].
AB  - Proper identification of the organism and determination of their sensitivity to antimicrobial agents, is the most important part of the management of patients with symptoms of respiratory system infections. In the case of pulmonary infections, the utility of sputum for diagnosing the cause of lower respiratory tract infections seems to be limited. In the patients receiving antibiotics, there is a high rate of colonization of the upper respiratory tract that may lead to the overgrowth of one or an other pathogen, making it more abundant in the upper than an lower respiratory tract. Also, the patients may be unable to provide adequate lower-respiratory-tract samples. For these reason, more invasive procedures have been recommended. These include bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sampling. The purpose of our study was to determine the value of sputum and BAL fluid on the basis of profile bacteria and their drug sensitivity isolated from the patients treated in Nat. Res. Inst. Tuber. and Lung Diseases in Warsaw during period of 3 years (1995-1997). On the basis of analysis of 5926 sputum samples and 3534 bronchoscopic materials we have found that the bacterial pathogens species and drug resistant pattern were similar in sputum samples as in materials of bronchoscopic procedures. The same bacterial species and numbers Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were predominant in both type of clinical materials with near the same frequency.
TI  - Structure of Haemophilus influenzae HslU protein in crystals with one-dimensional disorder twinning.
AB  - The structure of the Haemophilus influenzae HslU protein, a molecular chaperone of the Clp/Hsp100 family, has been solved to 2.3 A by molecular replacement using a model of the homologous Escherichia coli protein. The crystals in which the structure was solved have an unusual twinning, or one-dimensional disorder, in which each successive crystal-packing layer is displaced laterally relative to the one below it. A model for the twinning and an algorithm for detwinning the data are described. It is known from other work that when the HslU hexamer binds its cognate protease HslV, the carboxy-terminal helices of HslU protomers distend and bind between HslV subunits. Comparison of HslU alone with its structure in the HslUV complex reveals several conserved amino-acid residues whose side-chain interactions differ between the two structures, suggesting that they may be part of a conformational switch that facilitates the release of the HslU carboxy-terminal helices when HslV binds.
TI  - Bacteriology and beta-lactamase activity in acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the bacteriology of beta-lactamase (BL) enzyme activity in  sputum of 40 patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB). METHODS: The microbiology, BL production by the different isolates, and BL contents in the sputum were determined. RESULTS: Eighty-four isolates were recovered (2.1 isolates per specimen), 44 aerobic and facultative (1.1 isolates per specimen), and 40 anaerobic (1.0 isolate per specimen). Aerobic bacteria were recovered in only 9 (22.5%) specimens, anaerobic bacteria in 9 (22.5%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were found in 22 (55%). The predominant aerobic isolates were Streptococcus pneumoniae (15 isolates), Haemophilus influenzae (11), Moraxella catarrhalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4 each). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp. (19), Prevotella sp. (11), and Fusobacterium sp.(6). Mixed flora were present in 25 (62.5%) specimens, and the number of isolates varied from 2 to 5 per specimen. Thirty-nine beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (BLPB) were isolated in 33 (82.5%) of the 40 cases. The predominant aerobic BLPB were H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, K. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. The predominant anaerobic BLPB were Prevotella sp. and Fusobacterium sp. Beta-lactamase activity was detected in 26 (79%) of 33 of specimens in which BLPB were isolated, and in none of the seven specimens that did not harbor BLPB. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid detection of BL activity in sputum specimens may have implications for the antimicrobial management with AECB.
TI  - Characterization of alanine and malate dehydrogenases from a marine psychrophile  strain PA-43.
AB  - Alanine dehydrogenase (AlaDH: EC 1.4.1.1), malate dehydrogenase (MDH: EC 1.1.1.37), and glutamate dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.2), all NAD+ dependent, were detected in extracts from a psychrophilic bacterium, strain PA-43, isolated from a sea urchin off the Icelandic coast. Characterization tests suggested that the strain had a close relationship to Vibrio, but sequencing of part of the 16S rDNA gene placed the bacterium among Shewanella species in a constructed phylogenetic tree. The bacterium had an optimum growth temperature of 16.5 degrees C, and maximum dehydrogenase expression was obtained in a rich medium supplemented with NaCl. Both AlaDH and MDH were purified to homogeneity. AlaDH is a hexamer, with an approximate relative molecular mass of 260,000, whereas MDH is dimeric, with an apparent relative molecular mass of approximately 70,000. Both enzymes were thermolabile, and the optimum temperatures for activity were shifted toward lower temperatures than those found in the same enzymes from mesophiles, 37 degrees C for MDH and approximately 47 degrees C for AlaDH. The pH optima for AlaDH in the forward and reverse reactions were 10.5 and 9, respectively, whereas those for MDH were 10-10.2 and 8.8, respectively. Partial amino acid sequences, comprising approximately 30% of the total sequences from each enzyme, were determined for N-terminal, tryptic, and chymotryptic fragments of the enzymes. The AlaDH showed the highest similarity to AlaDHs from the psychrotroph Shewanella Ac10 and the mesophile Vibrio proteolyticus, whereas MDH was most similar to the MDHs from the mesophiles Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae, with lower identity to the psychrophilic malate dehydrogenases from Vibrio 5710 and Photobacterium SS9.
TI  - Validation of cefditoren MIC quality control ranges by a multi-laboratory study (2001).
AB  - The potency of cefditoren has been well documented to include broad coverage against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms including species causing community-acquired respiratory tract infections. The accuracy of in vitro test results has been questioned due to debate over inconsistencies in quality control (QC) recommendations published by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). Previous studies have recommended conflicting and generally broad MIC dilution ranges for several commonly used QC organisms. This study used NCCLS recommended guidelines to re-evaluate the MIC ranges using a seven laboratory M23-A2 design. The results of this multi-laboratory investigation leads to the proposal of the following QC range recommendations for cefditoren: Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 (0.016-0.06 microg/mL); Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247 (0.06-0.25 microg/mL); Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 (0.12-1 microg/mL); and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 (0.25-1 microg/mL). These proposed ranges validate those suggested previously for E. coli and the problematic H. influenzae, but a three log(2) dilution range may be sufficient for S. aureus and S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Identification and characterization of novel competence genes comA and exbB involved in natural genetic transformation of Pseudomonas stutzeri.
AB  - After transposon mutagenesis we identified a novel gene (comA) of Pseudomonas stutzeri which is essential for natural genetic transformation. The putative amino acid sequence is similar to ComA orthologs of other transformable bacteria including Neisseria gonorrhoeae (ComA), Haemophilus influenzae (Rec-2), Bacillus subtilis (ComEC) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (CelB). Downstream of comA two partially overlapping open reading frames termed exbB and exbD were found coding for putative proteins similar to proteins required for macromolecule uptake in Escherichia coli and present in other Gram-negative bacteria. Insertional inactivation of exbB decreased the transformability to 20% of that of the wild type. The binding of 3H-labeled DNA and its uptake into a DNase-resistant state in the comA and exbB strains were similar to the wild type, suggesting that these proteins are involved in a late step of transformation, presumably in the translocation of DNA from the periplasm into the cytosol. The question of whether the translocation process occurs separately from the step of single-strand formation is discussed.
TI  - Production of N-acyl homoserine lactones by gram-negative bacteria isolated from  contact lens wearers.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the production of N-acyl-homoserine  lactone (AHL) signal molecules in ocular gram-negative bacteria. A total of 91 ocular strains isolated from contact lens adverse response patients and asymptomatic subjects were used in the study. These included Acinetobacter, Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia liquefaciens, Serratia marcescens, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The biosensor strains Chromobacterium violaceum mutant CV026 and Agrobacterium tumefaciens A136 were used for detection of AHL signal molecules. The majority of A. hydrophila, P. aeruginosa, and S. liquefaciens strains produced more than one AHL molecule. Serratia marcescens strains were AHL positive only under detection of A136. The rest of the test species did not show any AHL production under the current detection system. These findings indicate that AHL-mediated quorum-sensing systems are present in some of the ocular bacteria, and the different signal molecules may be involved with the quorum-sensing pathway in the other bacterial species.
TI  - High enzymatic activity and chaperone function are mechanistically related features of the dimeric E. coli peptidyl-prolyl-isomerase FkpA.
AB  - We have recently described the existence of a chaperone activity for the dimeric  peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase FkpA from the periplasm of Escherichia coli that is independent of its isomerase activity. We have now investigated the molecular mechanism of these two activities in vitro in greater detail. The isomerase activity with a protein substrate (RNaseT1) is characterized by a 100-fold higher k(cat)/K(M) value than with a short tetrapeptide substrate. This enhanced activity with a protein is due to an increased affinity towards the protein substrate mediated by a polypeptide-binding site that is distinct from the active site. The chaperone activity is also mediated by interaction of folding and unfolding intermediates with a binding site that is most likely identical to the polypeptide-binding site which enhances catalysis. Both activities are thus mechanistically related, being based on the transient interaction with this high-affinity polypeptide-binding site. Only the isomerase activity, but not the chaperone activity, with the substrate citrate synthase can be inhibited by FK520. Experiments with the isolated domains of FkpA imply that both the isomerase and the chaperone site are located on the highly conserved FKBP domain. The additional amino-terminal domain mediates the dimerization and thus places the two active sites of the FKBP domains in juxtaposition, such that they can simultaneously interact with a protein, and this is required for full catalytic activity.
TI  - Evidence for gene silencing in Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Evidence for gene silencing of Haemophilus influenzae involved a beta-subunit of  RNA polymerase. The gene presumed silenced was rifampin resistance. The evidence that it was silencing, rather than dominance of a rifampin-sensitive marker, was that it took place when the rifampin resistance marker was on both a plasmid and the chromosome, without the presence of a rifampin-sensitive marker, as judged by lack of transformation of a rifampin-resistant cell to rifampin sensitivity by the plasmid. In addition, three compounds that are known to decrease gene silencing in eukaryotes (trichostatin A, sodium butyrate and 5-azacytidine) also decreased the presumed silencing in H. influenzae. Silencing of rifampin-resistant Escherichia coli did not take place with the plasmid from H. influenzae.
TI  - Antibiotic-resistant bacterial sepsis in Papua New Guinea.
AB  - Infections due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria, especially gram-negative bacteria, are a common cause of child mortality in Papua New Guinea. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria include the enteric gram-negative bacilli, especially Escherichia coli, Klebsiella and Enterobacter, and Haemophilus influenzae type b, a major respiratory tract pathogen and cause of meningitis. Among these bacteria there is now high-level resistance to standard antibiotics, including chloramphenicol, amoxycillin and cotrimoxazole. Reasons behind the increase in antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections are the widespread unregulated use of antibiotics and the very large burden of bacterial infections. Risk factors for development of resistant enteric gram-negative infections include village births, prolonged hospital stay, kwashiorkor in adopted children and previous treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Cost-effective strategies to combat these pathogens will need to be broad and must focus on reducing the use of antibiotics for trivial illnesses, reducing the need to use antibiotics and reducing the risk factors for resistant bacterial sepsis. There must be stricter regulation of commercial pharmacies, education of health workers on how to avoid inappropriate antibiotic prescribing, a focus on the prevention of pneumonia by immunization with new vaccines, improvements in the quality and uptake of formal maternal care services and public health measures within villages. In addition there is a need for better surveillance for antibiotic-resistant bacteria within hospitals; this will require substantial improvements in laboratory facilities and carefully planned research collaboration. A national committee should be established to advise on these matters and coordinate interventions.
TI  - Evaluation of spontaneous contamination of ocular medications.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In order to evaluate whether single-dose ophthalmic preparations in 0.5-ml containers can safely be used within 24 h after the first opening, eigth different sterile ocular medications containing timolol, jaluronic acid, diclofenac, ketotifen, pilocarpine, formocortal, formocortal-gentamycin, and tetryzoline-feniramine (Farmigea, Italy) were opened and tested for spontaneous bacterial contamination after exposure to air. METHODS: Samples (10 microl) were collected from exposed ophthalmic preparations after 0, 2, 4, 8 and 24 h. RESULTS: No viable microorganisms were detected during and at the end of the evaluation period. In order to assess whether the resident or pathogenic ocular bacterial population due to repeated handling might contaminate the medications, about 10(5) cells of different species (Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus spp., Corynebacterium spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria spp., Acinetobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans) were added to the containers and incubated at 37 degrees C or at room temperature. Samples were collected and the number of viable bacteria was estimated. The antibacterial effect of the ophthalmic compounds varied depending on the species considered. Tetryzoline-feniramine, pilocarpine, ketotifen and formocortal-gentamycin exhibited a frank bactericidal activity (<100 survivors after 18-24 h of exposure) against the great majority of the species tested. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the risk of spontaneous contamination of ophthalmic preparations after their first opening is low, and that all preparations tested exhibit an aspecific antibacterial activity. As a consequence, the safe usage of these ocular medications could be extended from the recommended 3 h to at least 24 h after the first usage.
TI  - Cloning and expression of two novel hemin binding protein genes from Treponema denticola.
AB  - Treponema denticola does not appear to produce siderophores, so it must acquire iron by other pathways. Indeed, T. denticola has been shown to have an iron-regulated 44-kDa outer membrane protein (HbpA) with hemin binding ability. To characterize the HbpA protein, its gene was cloned from genomic DNA libraries of T. denticola. Sequence analysis of the hbpA open reading frame indicated that it encoded a 42.8-kDa protein with a 23-amino-acid signal peptide. HbpA has no significant homology to any proteins in the databases. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that hbpA is present in several T. denticola ATCC strains and clinical isolates, but not in Treponema pectinovorum, Treponema socranskii, or Escherichia coli. HbpA, expressed as a recombinant protein in E. coli and purified by antibody affinity chromatography, has hemin binding activity as determined by lithium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with tetramethylbenzidine staining. Northern blot analysis showed that there were two hbpA-containing transcripts, of approximately 1.3 and 2.6 kb, and that the RNA levels were low-iron induced. Interestingly, the 2.6-kb mRNA also encoded a second protein with significant homology to hbpA. This downstream gene, called hbpB, was cloned and sequenced and its product was expressed as a fusion protein in E. coli. The hbpB gene product is 49% identical to HbpA and binds hemin. Thus, T. denticola has two novel hemin binding proteins which may be part of a previously unrecognized iron acquisition pathway.
TI  - Cloning, overexpression, purification, and immunobiology of an 85-kilodalton outer membrane protein from Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - We have identified an 85-kDa outer membrane protein that is expressed by all tested strains of Haemophilus ducreyi. Studies of related proteins from other pathogenic bacteria, including Haemophilus influenzae, Pasteurella multocida, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Shigella dysenteriae, suggested a role for these proteins in pathogenesis and immunity. In keeping with the first such described protein from Haemophilus influenzae type B, we termed the H. ducreyi protein D15. The gene encoding the H. ducreyi D15 protein was cloned and sequenced, and the deduced amino acid sequence was found to be most similar to sequences of the D15-related proteins from other Pasteurella spp. The arrangement of the flanking genes was similar to that of H. influenzae Rd and suggested that D15 was part of a multigene operon. Attempts to make a null mutation of the D15 gene were unsuccessful, paralleling results in other D15 gene studies. Overexpression of H. ducreyi D15 in Escherichia coli resulted in a source of recombinant D15 (rD15) from which it was readily purified. rD15 was immunogenic, and it was found that immunization of rabbits with an rD15 vaccine preparation conferred partial protection against a virulent challenge infection. Antisera to an N-terminal peptide recognized all tested strains of H. ducreyi.
TI  - Global versus local regulatory roles for Lrp-related proteins: Haemophilus influenzae as a case study.
AB  - Lrp (leucine-responsive regulatory protein) plays a global regulatory role in Escherichia coli, affecting expression of dozens of operons. Numerous lrp-related genes have been identified in different bacteria and archaea, including asnC, an E. coli gene that was the first reported member of this family. Pairwise comparisons of amino acid sequences of the corresponding proteins shows an average sequence identity of only 29% for the vast majority of comparisons. By contrast, Lrp-related proteins from enteric bacteria show more than 97% amino acid identity. Is the global regulatory role associated with E. coli Lrp limited to enteric bacteria? To probe this question we investigated LrfB, an Lrp-related protein from Haemophilus influenzae that shares 75% sequence identity with E. coli Lrp (highest sequence identity among 42 sequences compared). A strain of H. influenzae having an lrfB null allele grew at the wild-type growth rate but with a filamentous morphology. A comparison of two-dimensional (2D) electrophoretic patterns of proteins from parent and mutant strains showed only two differences (comparable studies with lrp(+) and lrp E. coli strains by others showed 20 differences). The abundance of LrfB in H. influenzae, estimated by Western blotting experiments, was about 130 dimers per cell (compared to 3,000 dimers per E. coli cell). LrfB expressed in E. coli replaced Lrp as a repressor of the lrp gene but acted only to a limited extent as an activator of the ilvIH operon. Thus, although LrfB resembles Lrp sufficiently to perform some of its functions, its low abundance is consonant with a more local role in regulating but a few genes, a view consistent with the results of the 2D electrophoretic analysis. We speculate that an Lrp having a global regulatory role evolved to help enteric bacteria adapt to their ecological niches and that it is unlikely that Lrp-related proteins in other organisms have a broad regulatory function.
TI  - Database verification studies of SWISS-PROT and GenBank.
AB  - PROBLEM STATEMENT: We have studied the relationships among SWISS-PROT, TrEMBL, and GenBank with two goals. First is to determine whether users can reliably identify those proteins in SWISS-PROT whose functions were determined experimentally, as opposed to proteins whose functions were predicted computationally. If this information was present in reasonable quantities, it would allow researchers to decrease the propagation of incorrect function predictions during sequence annotation, and to assemble training sets for developing the next generation of sequence-analysis algorithms. Second is to assess the consistency between translated GenBank sequences and sequences in SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL. RESULTS: (1) Contrary to claims by the SWISS-PROT authors, we conclude that SWISS-PROT does not identify a significant number of experimentally characterized proteins. (2) SWISS-PROT is more incomplete than we expected in that version 38.0 from July 1999 lacks many proteins from the full genomes of important organisms that were sequenced years earlier. (3) Even if we combine SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL, some sequences from the full genomes are missing from the combined dataset. (4) In many cases, translated GenBank genes do not exactly match the corresponding SWISS-PROT sequences, for reasons that include missing or removed methionines, differing translation start positions, individual amino-acid differences, and inclusion of sequence data from multiple sequencing projects. For example, results show that for Escherichia coli, 80.6% of the proteins in the GenBank entry for the complete genome have identical sequence matches with SWISS-PROT/TrEMBL sequences, 13.4% have exact substring matches, and matches for 4.1% can be found using BLAST search; the remaining 2.0% of E.coli protein sequences (most of which are ORFs) have no clear matches to SWISS-PROT/TrEMBL. Although many of these differences can be explained by the complexity of the DB, and by the curation processes used to create it, the scale of the differences is notable.
TI  - Overproduction, purification and novel redox properties of the dihaem cytochrome  c, NapB, from Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The napB gene of the pathogenic bacterium Haemophilus influenzae encodes a dihaem cytochrome c, the small subunit of a heterodimeric periplasmic nitrate reductase similar to those found in other bacteria. In order to obtain sufficient protein for biophysical studies, we aimed to overproduce the recombinant dihaem protein in Escherichia coli. Initial expression experiments indicated that the NapB signal peptide was not cleaved by the leader peptidase of the host organism. Apocytochrome was formed under aerobic, semi-aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions in either Luria--Bertani or minimal salts medium. The highest amounts of apo-NapB were produced in the latter medium, and the bulk was inserted into the cytoplasmic membrane. The two haem groups were covalently attached to the pre-apocytochrome only under anaerobic growth conditions, and with 2.5 mM nitrite or at least 10 mM nitrate supplemented to the minimal salts growth medium. In order to obtain holocytochrome, the gene sequence encoding mature NapB was cloned in-frame with the E. coli ompA (outer membrane protein A) signal sequence. Under anaerobic conditions, NapB was secreted into the periplasmic space, with the OmpA signal peptide being correctly processed and with both haem c groups attached covalently. Unless expressed in the DegP-protease-deficient strain HM125, some of the recombinant NapB polypeptides were N-terminally truncated as a result of proteolytic activity. Under aerobic growth conditions, co-expression with the E. coli ccm (cytochrome c maturation) genes resulted in a higher yield of holocytochrome c. The pure recombinant NapB protein showed absorption maxima at 419, 522 and 550 nm in the reduced form. The midpoint reduction potentials of the two haem groups were determined to be -25 mV and -175 mV. These results support our hypothesis that the Nap system fulfils a nitrate-scavenging role in H. influenzae.
TI  - Subcloning, expression, purification, and characterization of Haemophilus influenzae glycerol kinase.
AB  - Glycerol kinase (EC 2.7.1.30) is a bacterial sugar kinase and a member of the sugar kinase/actin/hsc-70 superfamily of enzymes. The enzyme from Escherichia coli is an allosteric regulatory enzyme whose activity is inhibited by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) and the glucose-specific phosphocarrier of the phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system, IIA(Glc) (previously termed III(Glc)). Comparison of its primary structure with that of the highly similar Haemophilus influenzae glycerol kinase reveals that the amino acid sequence for the binding site for FBP is conserved while the amino acid sequence for the binding site for IIA(Glc) contains differences that are predicted to prevent its inhibition. To test this hypothesis, the H. influenzae glpK gene was assembled from DNA library fragments and subcloned into pUC18. The enzyme is expressed at high levels in E. coli. It was purified to greater than 90% homogeneity by taking advantage of its solubility behavior in a procedure that requires no column chromatography. The initial-velocity kinetic parameters of the purified enzyme are similar to those of the E. coli glycerol kinase. The H. influenzae glycerol kinase is inhibited by FBP but not by IIA(Glc), in agreement with the prediction based on sequence comparison. Sedimentation velocity experiments reveal that inhibition of HiGK by FBP is associated with oligomerization, behavior which is similar to EcGK. The possibility of utilizing mutagenesis studies to exploit the high degree of similarity of these two enzymes to elucidate the mechanism of allosteric regulation by IIA(Glc) is discussed.
TI  - Inversions and the dynamics of eukaryotic gene order.
AB  - Comparisons of the gene order in closely related genomes reveal a major role for  inversions in the genome shuffling process. In contrast to prokaryotes, where the inversions are predominantly large, half of the inversions between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans appear to be small, often encompassing only a single gene. Overall the genome rearrangement rate appears higher in eukaryotes than in prokaryotes, and the current genome data do not indicate that functional constraints on the co-expression of neighboring genes have a large role in conserving eukaryotic gene order. Nevertheless, qualitatively interesting examples of conservation of gene order in eukaryotes can be observed.
TI  - Identification, substrate specificity, and inhibition of the Streptococcus pneumoniae beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase III (FabH).
AB  - In the bacterial type II fatty acid synthase system, beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) synthase III (FabH) catalyzes the condensation of acetyl-CoA with malonyl-ACP. We have identified, expressed, and characterized the Streptococcus pneumoniae homologue of Escherichia coli FabH. S. pneumoniae FabH is approximately 41, 39, and 38% identical in amino acid sequence to Bacillus subtilis, E. coli, and Hemophilus influenzae FabH, respectively. The His-Asn-Cys catalytic triad present in other FabH molecules is conserved in S. pneumoniae FabH. The apparent K(m) values for acetyl-CoA and malonyl-ACP were determined to be 40.3 and 18.6 microm, respectively. Purified S. pneumoniae FabH preferentially utilized straight short-chain CoA primers. Similar to E. coli FabH, S. pneumoniae FabH was weakly inhibited by thiolactomycin. In contrast, inhibition of S. pneumoniae FabH by the newly developed compound SB418011 was very potent, with an IC(50) value of 0.016 microm. SB418011 also inhibited E. coli and H. influenzae FabH with IC(50) values of 1.2 and 0.59 microm, respectively. The availability of purified and characterized S. pneumoniae FabH will greatly aid in structural studies of this class of essential bacterial enzymes and facilitate the identification of small molecule inhibitors of type II fatty acid synthase with the potential to be novel and potent antibacterial agents active against pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Identification of novel essential Escherichia coli genes conserved among pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - We deleted a subset of 27 open reading frames (ORFs) from Escherichia coli which  encode previously uncharacterized, probably soluble gene products homologous to proteins from a broad spectrum of bacterial pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis and only distantly related to eukaryotic proteins. Six novel bacteria-specific genes essential for growth in complex medium could be identified through a combination of bioinformatics-based and experimental approaches. We also compared our data to published results of gene inactivation projects with Mycoplasma genitalium and Bacillus subtilis and looked for homologs in all known prokaryotic genomes. Such analyses highlight the enormous metabolic flexibility of prokaryotes. Six of 27 studied genes have been functionally characterized up to now, amongst these four of the essential genes. The gene products YgbP, YgbB and YchB are involved in the non-mevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis. KdtB is characterized as the posphopantetheine adenylyltransferase CoaD. There are indications that the other two essential gene products YjeE and YqgF, which we have identified, also possess enzymatic functions. These findings demonstrate the potential of such proteins to be used in screening of large chemical libraries for inhibitors which could be further developed to novel broad-spectrum antibiotics.
TI  - Solution structure of the DNA-binding domain of the TyrR protein of Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The TyrR protein of Haemophilus influenzae is a 36-kD transcription factor whose  major function is to control the expression of genes important in the biosynthesis and transport of aromatic amino acids. Using (1)H and (15)N NMR spectroscopy, we have determined the 3D solution structure of the TyrR C-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD) containing residues from 258 to 318 (TyrR[258-318]). The NMR results show that this segment of TyrR consists of a potential hinge helix at its N terminus (residues 263-270) as well as three well-defined alpha-helices extending from residues 277-289 (HR-2), 293-300 (HR-1), and 304-314 (HR). Helix HR-1 and HR fold in a typical helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif. The three helices and the hinge helix are tightly bound together by hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonds. Several hydrophilic residues whose side chains may directly interact with DNA are identified. A hydrophobic patch that may be part of the interaction surface between the domains of TyrR protein is also observed. Comparisons with the structures of other HTH DNA-binding proteins reveal that in terms of the spatial orientation of the three helices, this protein most closely resembles the cap family.
TI  - SecB, a molecular chaperone with two faces.
AB  - SecB is a molecular chaperone unique to the phylum Proteobacteria, which includes the majority of known Gram-negative bacteria of medical, industrial and agricultural significance. SecB is involved in the translocation of secretory proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane. The crystal structure of the Haemophilus influenzae SecB provides new insights into how SecB simultaneously recognizes its two ligands: unfolded preproteins and SecA, the ATPase subunit of the translocase. SecB uses its entire molecular surface for these two functions, but for preprotein release and its own membrane release, SecB relies on the catalytic activity of SecA. This defines SecB as a translocation-specific molecular chaperone.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of essential oils and their major constituents against respiratory tract pathogens by gaseous contact.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of 14 essential oils and their major constituents in the gaseous state was evaluated against Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. For most essential oils examined, H. influenzae was most susceptible, followed by S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes, and then S. aureus. Penicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. pneumoniae were comparable in susceptibility. Escherichia coli, which was used as a control, showed least susceptibility. A minimal inhibitory dose (MID) was introduced as a measure of the vapour activity. Among 14 essential oils, cinnamon bark, lemon-grass and thyme oils showed the lowest MID, followed by essential oils containing terpene alcohols as major constituents. The essential oils containing terpene ketone, ether and, in particular, hydrocarbon had high MIDS. The vapour activity on short exposure was comparable to that following overnight exposure, and rapid evaporation was more effective than slow evaporation of essential oils. The vapour concentration and absorption into agar of essential oils reached a maximum 1 or 2 h after rapid evaporation. These results indicate that the antibacterial action of essential oils was most effective when at high vapour concentration for a short time.
TI  - Analysis of codon usage patterns of bacterial genomes using the self-organizing map.
AB  - Codon usage varies both between organisms and between different genes in the same organism. This observation has been used as a basis for earlier work in identifying highly expressed and horizontally transferred genes in Escherichia coli. In this work, we applied Kohonen's self-organizing map to analysis of the codon usage pattern of the Escherichia coli, Aquifex aeolicus, Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Haemophilus influenzae RD:, Methanococcus jannaschii, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, and Pyrococcus horikoshii genomes for evidence of highly expressed genes and horizontally transferred genes. All of the analyzed genomes had a clear category of horizontally transferred genes, and their apparent percentages ranged from 7.7% to 21.4%. The apparent percentage of highly expressed genes ranges from 0% to 11.8%. A clustering of average codon usage of main gene categories of the seven genomes showed an interesting mixing of gene classes in four thermophilic/hyperthermophilic organisms, A. aeolicus, A. fulgidus, M. thermoautotrophicum, and P. horikoshii, which suggests possible origins of their horizontally transferred genes as well as the need for adaptation to a specific environment. Further classification of the three gene categories in E. coli and H. influenzae according to gene function revealed that genes involved in communication (such as regulation and cell process) and structure (cell structure and structural proteins) are more likely to be horizontally transferred than are genes involved in information (transcription, translation, and related processes) and in some groups of energy (such as energy metabolism and carbon compound catabolism).
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetics of SC-002 and its derivative, SC-004: new oral cephalosporins.
AB  - SC-002 is a novel oral cephalosporin possessing a unique thiadiazolylethenyl moiety at the 3 position. In the present study, it was the most active against gram-positive bacteria among oral cephalosporins such as cefdinir (CFDN), cefpodoxime, cefditoren and cefaclor (CCL). It was equal to or 16 times more active than CFDN against standard and clinical strains. In particular, against clinical isolates of Morganella morganii and Haemophilus influenzae, SC-002 was 8-64 times more active than CFDN. The antibacterial activity of SC-002 against some beta-lactam-resistant strains was superior to that of CFDN. The in vivo antibacterial activity of SC-004, a pivaloyloxymethyl ester of SC-002, was 1.2-8 times more protective against systemic infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae than that of CFDN. The therapeutic effects of SC-004 on experimental respiratory tract infections caused by S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae were superior to those of CFDN and CCL. SC-004 showed higher and longer-lasting blood levels and higher urinary excretion in pharmacokinetics in mice.
TI  - New developments in our understanding of the beta-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases.
AB  - The beta-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases are a structurally conserved family of enzymes that catalyze the NAD(+) or NADP(+)-dependent oxidation of specific beta-hydroxyacid substrates like beta-hydroxyisobutyrate. These enzymes share distinct domains of amino acid sequence homology, most of which now have assigned putative functions. 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and beta-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase, the most well-characterized members, both appear to be readily inactivated by chemical modifiers of lysine residues, such as 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonate (TNBS). Peptide mapping by ESI-LCMS showed that inactivation of beta-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase with TNBS occurs with the labeling of a single lysine residue, K248. This lysine residue is completely conserved in all family members and may have structural importance relating to cofactor binding. The structural framework of the beta-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase family is shared by many bacterial homologues. One such homologue from E. coli has been cloned and expressed as recombinant protein. This protein was found to have enzymatic activity characteristic of tartronate semialdehyde reductase, an enzyme required for bacterial biosynthesis of D-glycerate. A homologue from H. influenzae was also cloned and expressed as recombinant protein. This protein was active in the oxidation of D-glycerate, but showed approximately ten-fold higher activity with four carbon substrates like beta-D-hydroxybutyrate and D-threonine. This enzyme might function in H. influenzae, and other species, in the utilization of polyhydroxybutyrates, an energy storage form specific to bacteria. Cloning and characterization of these bacterial beta-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases extends our knowledge of this enzyme family.
TI  - Conservation of the binding site for the arginine repressor in all bacterial lineages.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The arginine repressor ArgR/AhrC is a transcription factor universally conserved in bacterial genomes. Its recognition signal (the ARG box), a weak palindrome, is also conserved between genomes, despite a very low degree of similarity between individual sites within a genome. Thus, the arginine repressor is different from two other universal transcription factors - HrcA, whose recognition signal is very strongly conserved both within and between genomes, and LexA/DinR, whose signal is strongly conserved within, but not between, genomes. The arginine regulon is well studied in Escherichia coli and to some extent in Bacillus subtilis and some other genomes. Here, we apply the comparative genomic approach to the prediction of the ArgR-binding sites in all completely sequenced bacterial genomes. RESULTS: Orthologs of ArgR/AhrC were identified in the complete genomes of E. coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Vibrio choleras, B. subtilis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Thermotoga maritima, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Deinococcus radiodurans. Candidate arginine repressor binding sites were identified upstream of arginine transport and metabolism genes. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the ArgR/AhrC recognition signal is conserved in all genomes that contain genes encoding orthologous transcription factors of this family. All genomes studied except M. tuberculosis contain ABC transport cassettes (related to the Art system of E. coli) belonging to the candidate arginine regulons.
TI  - Quality control parameters for cefditoren susceptibility tests.
AB  
TI  - Contribution of the DDDD motif of H. influenzae e (P4) to phosphomonoesterase activity and heme transport.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae lipoprotein e (P4) is a member of the DDDD phosphohydrolase superfamily and mediates heme transport. Each of the aspartate residues of the signature motif is required for phosphomonoesterase activity, as none of the e (P4) single D mutants (D64A, D66A, D181N, and D185A) possessed detectable phosphomonoesterase activity. These results suggest that the signature motif is essential to the phosphomonoesterase activity of lipoprotein e (P4). When assessed for phosphomonoesterase-dependent heme transport activity in Escherichia coli hemA strains, plasmids containing D181N and D185A retained heme transport as indicated by aerobic growth while D64A and D66A did not. We conclude that phosphomonoesterase activity is not required for heme transport.
TI  - Hsp70s contain a specific sulfogalactolipid binding site. Differential aglycone influence on sulfogalactosyl ceramide binding by recombinant prokaryotic and eukaryotic hsp70 family members.
AB  - Specific 3'-sulfogalactolipid [SGL-sulfogalactosyl ceramide (SGCer) and sulfogalactosylglycerolipid (SGG)] binding is compared for hsp70s cloned from Helicobacter pylori, Haemophilus influenzae, Chlamydia trachomatis serovar E, Escherichia coli, murine male germ cells, and the hsp70-like extracellular domain within the sperm receptor from Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. This lectin activity, conserved among the different hsp70 family members, is modulated by the SGL aglycone. This is shown by differential binding to both SGC fatty acid homologues and 3'-sulfogalactolipid neoglycoproteins generated by coupling bovine serum albumin (BSA) and glycosyl ceramide acids synthesized by oxidation of the double bond of sphingosine. Eukaryotic hsp70s preferentially bound the SGCer fatty acid homologues SG(24)Cer, SG(18)Cer, and SG(20:OH)Cer, while prokaryotic hsp70s bound SG(18:1)Cer and SG(20:OH)Cer. Eukaryotic hsp70s bound SGCer-BSA and SG(24)Cer-BSA conjugates where the latter is the main constituent in SGCer-BSA, while prokaryotic hsp70s bound SG(20:OH)Cer-BSA. None of the hsp70s bound sulfogalactosyl sphingosine (SGSph) or SGSph-BSA, further demonstrating the important role of the aglycone. Although the primary SGL recognition domain of all hsp70s is conserved, we propose that aglycone organization differentially influences the interaction with the sub-site. Heterogeneous SGCer aglycone isoforms in cells and the differential in vitro binding of eukaryotic and prokaryotic hsp70s may relate to their different adhesin roles in vivo as mediators of germ cell and bacterial/host interactions, respectively.
TI  - Heat-inducible surface stress protein (Hsp70) mediates sulfatide recognition of the respiratory pathogen Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The in vitro glycolipid binding specificity of clinical strains of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae is altered to include sulfated glycolipids following a brief heat shock. We have constructed, expressed, and purified a recombinant protein of H. influenzae Hsp70, which showed significant specific binding to sulfated galactolipids in vitro. Furthermore, indirect immunofluorescence demonstrates that Hsp70 proteins are surface exposed in H. influenzae only after heat shock and are contained in the outer membrane protein fractions.
TI  - A comparative genomics approach to prediction of new members of regulons.
AB  - Identifying the complete transcriptional regulatory network for an organism is a  major challenge. For each regulatory protein, we want to know all the genes it regulates, that is, its regulon. Examples of known binding sites can be used to estimate the binding specificity of the protein and to predict other binding sites. However, binding site predictions can be unreliable because determining the true specificity of the protein is difficult because of the considerable variability of binding sites. Because regulatory systems tend to be conserved through evolution, we can use comparisons between species to increase the reliability of binding site predictions. In this article, an approach is presented to evaluate the computational predictions of regulatory sites. We combine the prediction of transcription units having orthologous genes with the prediction of transcription factor binding sites based on probabilistic models. We augment the sets of genes in Escherichia coli that are expected to be regulated by two transcription factors, the cAMP receptor protein and the fumarate and nitrate reduction regulatory protein, through a comparison with the Haemophilus influenzae genome. At the same time, we learned more about the regulatory networks of H. influenzae, a species with much less experimental knowledge than E. coli. By studying orthologous genes subject to regulation by the same transcription factor, we also gained understanding of the evolution of the entire regulatory systems.
TI  - Identification, cloning, and expression of a functional phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (pheRS) from Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (pheRS) is unique among aminoacyl tRNA synthetases in that it is a heterotetrameric enzyme composed of two alpha-subunits and two larger beta-subunits. In prokaryotes, the alpha- and beta-subunits of pheRS are encoded by the genes pheS and pheT, respectively. In this report we describe the isolation of a DNA fragment (3.52 kb) containing the pheS and pheT genes from a Staphylococcus aureus (WCUH29) genomic DNA library. Both genes, found as a part of transcriptional operon, were predicted to encode polypeptides which showed strong primary and structural similarity to prokaryotic phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase alpha- and beta- subunits. We describe the high-level overexpression and purification of recombinant S. aureus pheRS using pheS and pheT genes as part of an artificial operon in Escherichia coli. For comparative analysis we also report a procedure for the purification of native pheRS from S. aureus (Oxford Strain) and demonstrate that Michaelis-Menten parameters for both recombinant and native enzyme, at least for phenylalanine tRNA aminoacylation are comparable.
TI  - Virulence of Pasteurella multocida recA mutants.
AB  - In order to determine the role of the RecA protein in the virulence of Pasteurella multocida, a recA mutant was constructed and used in studies of virulence and competition in relation to wild-type strain. To achieve this, firstly, the recA gene was isolated and sequenced, showing an Escherichia coli-like SOS box and encoding a protein of 354 amino acids which has the closest identity with the Haemophilus influenzae RecA protein. Further, the recA mutant was constructed, by inactivating this gene by single recombination of a suicide plasmid containing an internal region of the P. multocida recA gene, and shown to be more sensitive to UV radiation than the parental strain. The P. multocida mutant was slightly attenuated in virulence, as indicated by the LD(50), the time of death of infected animals, and a failure to compete with the wild-type strain in mixed infections. Compared to the parent strain, the mutant had a similar growth rate but a longer lag phase. These data suggest that the diminished virulence of the recA mutant as well as its failure in competition were more a consequence of the long lag phase rather than a direct effect of the inactivation of the recA gene on genes involved in virulence.
TI  - H-NS and H-NS-like proteins in Gram-negative bacteria and their multiple role in  the regulation of bacterial metabolism.
AB  - In Escherichia coli, the H-NS protein plays an important role in the structure and the functioning of bacterial chromosome. A homologous protein has also been identified in several enteric bacteria and in closely related organisms such as Haemophilus influenzae. To get information on their structure and their function, we identified H-NS-like proteins in various microorganisms by different procedures. In silico analysis of their amino acid sequence and/or in vivo experiments provide evidence that more than 20 proteins belong to the same class of regulatory proteins. Moreover, large scale technologies demonstrate that, at least in E. coli, the loss of motility in hns mutants results from a lack of flagellin biosynthesis, due to the in vivo repression of flagellar gene expression. In contrast, several genes involved in adaptation to low pH are strongly induced in a H-NS deficient strain, resulting in an increased resistance to acidic stress. Finally, expression profiling and phenotypic analysis suggest that, unlike H-NS, its paralogous protein StpA does not play any role in these processes.
TI  - Peptide deformylase as an antibacterial drug target: target validation and resistance development.
AB  - New inhibitors of peptide deformylase (PDF) which are very potent against the isolated enzyme and show a certain degree of antibacterial activity have recently been synthesized by our group. Several lines of experimental evidence indicate that these inhibitors indeed interfere with the target enzyme in the bacterial cell. (i) The inhibition of Escherichia coli growth could be counteracted by overexpression of PDF from different organisms, including E. coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae. Conversely, reduced expression of PDF in S. pneumoniae resulted in an increased susceptibility to the inhibitors. (ii) Proteome analysis on two-dimensional gels revealed a shift for many proteins towards lower pI in the presence of PDF inhibitors, as would be expected if the proteins still carry their N-formyl-Met terminus. (iii) PDF inhibitors show no antimicrobial activity against E. coli under conditions that make growth independent of formylation and deformylation. The antibacterial activity in E. coli was characterized as bacteriostatic. Furthermore, the development of resistance in E. coli was observed to occur with high frequency (10(-7)). Resistant mutants show a reduced growth rate, and DNA sequence analysis revealed mutations in their formyl transferase gene. Taking all these aspects into account, we conclude that PDF may not be an optimal target for broad-spectrum antibacterial agents.
TI  - Mu-like Prophage in serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis coding for surface-exposed antigens.
AB  - Sequence analysis of the genome of Neisseria meningititdis serogroup B revealed the presence of an approximately 35-kb region inserted within a putative gene coding for an ABC-type transporter. The region contains 46 open reading frames, 29 of which are colinear and homologous to the genes of Escherichia coli Mu phage. Two prophages with similar organizations were also found in serogroup A meningococcus, and one was found in Haemophilus influenzae. Early and late phage functions are well preserved in this family of Mu-like prophages. Several regions of atypical nucleotide content were identified. These likely represent genes acquired by horizontal transfer. Three of the acquired genes are shown to code for surface-associated antigens, and the encoded proteins are able to induce bactericidal antibodies.
TI  - Sequence analysis of the aminoacylase-1 family. A new proposed signature for metalloexopeptidases.
AB  - The amino acid sequence analysis of the human and porcine aminoacylases-1, the carboxypeptidase S precursor from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the succinyl-diaminopimelate desuccinylase from Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae and Corynebacterium glutamicum, the acetylornithine deacetylase from Escherichia coli and Dictyostelium discoideum and the carboxypeptidase G(2) precursor from Pseudomonas strain, using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) and the Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST), allowed us to suggest that all these enzymes, which share common functional and biochemical features, belong to the same structural family. The three amino acid blocks which were found to be highly conserved, using the CLUSTAL W program, could be assigned to the catalytic active site, based on the general three-dimensional structure of the carboxypeptidase G(2) from the Pseudomonas strain precursor. Six additional proteins with the same signature have been retrieved after performing two successive PSI-BLAST iterations using the sequence of the conserved motif, namely Lactobacillus delbrueckii aminoacyl-histidine dipeptidase, Streptomyces griseus aminopeptidase, Saccharomyces cerevisiae aminopeptidase Y precursor, two Bacillus stearothermophilus N-carbamyl-L-amino acid amidohydrolases and Pseudomonas sp. hydantoin utilization protein C. The three conserved amino acid motifs corresponded to the following blocks: (i) [S, G, A]-H-x-D-x-V; (ii) G-x-x-D; and (iii) x-E-E. This new sequence signature is clearly different from that commonly reported in the literature for proteins belonging to the ArgE/DapE/CPG2/YscS family.
TI  - Complete genomic sequence of Pasteurella multocida, Pm70.
AB  - We present here the complete genome sequence of a common avian clone of Pasteurella multocida, Pm70. The genome of Pm70 is a single circular chromosome 2,257,487 base pairs in length and contains 2,014 predicted coding regions, 6 ribosomal RNA operons, and 57 tRNAs. Genome-scale evolutionary analyses based on pairwise comparisons of 1,197 orthologous sequences between P. multocida, Haemophilus influenzae, and Escherichia coli suggest that P. multocida and H. influenzae diverged approximately 270 million years ago and the gamma subdivision of the proteobacteria radiated about 680 million years ago. Two previously undescribed open reading frames, accounting for approximately 1% of the genome, encode large proteins with homology to the virulence-associated filamentous hemagglutinin of Bordetella pertussis. Consistent with the critical role of iron in the survival of many microbial pathogens, in silico and whole-genome microarray analyses identified more than 50 Pm70 genes with a potential role in iron acquisition and metabolism. Overall, the complete genomic sequence and preliminary functional analyses provide a foundation for future research into the mechanisms of pathogenesis and host specificity of this important multispecies pathogen.
TI  - Correlation between Shine--Dalgarno sequence conservation and codon usage of bacterial genes.
AB  - In this study, we analyzed the correlation between codon usage bias and Shine--Dalgarno (SD) sequence conservation, using complete genome sequences of nine prokaryotes. For codon usage bias, we adopted the codon adaptation index (CAI), which is based on the codon usage preference of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, elongation factors, heat shock proteins, outer membrane proteins, and RNA polymerase subunit proteins. To compute SD sequence conservation, we used SD motif sequences predicted by Tompa and systematically aligned them with 5'UTR sequences. We found that there exists a clear correlation between the CAI values and SD sequence conservation in the genomes of Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, and Methanococcus jannaschii, and no relationship is found in M. genitalium, M. pneumoniae, and Synechocystis. That is, genes with higher CAI values tend to have more conserved SD sequences than do genes with lower CAI values in these organisms. Some organisms, such as M. thermoautotrophicum, do not clearly show the correlation. The biological significance of these results is discussed in the context of the translation initiation process and translation efficiency.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of the recombinant dihaem cytochrome c (NapB) from Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The napB gene of the pathogenic bacterium Haemophilus influenzae encodes a dihaem cytochrome c, the small subunit of a heterodimeric periplasmic nitrate reductase (Nap). Recombinant NapB was overproduced in Escherichia coli, purified to near-homogeneity and crystallized using the hanging-drop method. Thin quadrilateral plates were grown under various conditions but proved to be unsuitable for X-ray analysis. However, a single crystal was grown using 1.75 M ammonium sulfate in 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 5.5, from which a native data set could be collected to 1.8 A resolution using synchrotron radiation. Using the same conditions, further crystals were obtained by microseeding. The space group was determined to be P42(1)2, with unit-cell parameters a = 77.55, b = 77.55, c = 28.64 A and an unusually low solvent content of 16.5%, assuming there to be one molecule of NapB in the asymmetric unit. Analysis of the dissolved crystals indicated that partial proteolysis of the protein had occurred. Taking the molecular mass of the crystallized form ( approximately 8500 Da) into account, the solvent content was estimated to be 53%, with a V(M) value of 2.64 A(3) Da(-1).
TI  - Molecular basis of UV-sensitive mutant strain MBH3 of Haemophilus influenzae Rd:  identification of mutation in the uvrA gene.
AB  - We have previously reported on cloning a DNA repair gene designated as uvr3 by virtue of its ability to phenotypically complement the UV sensitivity of mutant strain MBH3. Subsequently, we identified the uvr3 gene to be the uvrA gene (gene identification number HI0249) of Haemophilus influenzae Rd. The uvrA gene is a component of the UvrABC excision repair pathway. We studied molecular basis of the UV sensitivity of the MBH3 strain and identified a G-->A transition at nucleotide position 2700 of the uvrA gene, altering the Trp-900 codon (TGG) to a nonsense codon (TGA). Thus, the UvrA protein produced in the mutant strain MBH3 is likely to be truncated and unable to carry out the UV-induced DNA repair, thereby rendering the strain UV sensitive.
TI  - Properties of recombinant HtrA: an otitis media vaccine candidate antigen from non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Non-encapsulated or non-typable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a major cause of middle ear infections in young children. HtrA has been identified as a vaccine candidate antigen from NTHi; therefore physicochemical characterization of this antigen is important for vaccine development. Recombinant NTHi HtrA has been expressed in E. coli and shown to have serine protease activity. Several mutant, recombinant HtrA proteins were expressed and purified to obtain suitable vaccine antigens lacking protease activity. Two mutants with alterations at the putative active site His91 and Ser197, designated H91A and S197A were examined by circular dichroic spectropolarimetry (CD) to evaluate secondary structure. The S197A mutant had a more random secondary structure compared to wild-type rHtrA or H91A. It is likely that improper folding of S197A accounts for its lack of immunoprotective properties in a chinchilla model of otitis media.
TI  - Spontaneous Escherichia coli meningitis in an adult.
AB  - Spontaneous meningitis due to gram-negative bacilli (excluding Hemophilus influenzae) is an infrequent infection in adult patients. It usually occurs in patients with underlying immunosuppressive conditions. Most of the cases are due to Escherichia coli and represent a complication of bacteraemia. The infection has a high mortality rate which may be as high as 90%, especially if associated with septicaemia. We report the case of a 53-y-old man with spontaneous, community-acquired Escherichia coli meningitis who was admitted with an unusual presentation. Blood and urine cultures were negative.
TI  - Acute mastoiditis--the antibiotic era: a multicenter study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical course and identify the causative organisms  of acute mastoiditis in a community where most of the patients who develop acute otitis media are treated with antibiotics. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective review of a series of 223 consecutive cases of acute mastoiditis. SETTING: Nine secondary or tertiary academic or non-academic referral centers. RESULTS: Prior to the diagnosis of acute mastoiditis, 121 of the patients (54.3%) had been receiving oral antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media for periods ranging from 1 to 21 days (mean 5.3 days). Samples for bacterial culture were obtained from 152 patients. Cultures were negative in 60 patients. The organisms isolated in the 92 positive cultures were: Streptococcus pneumoniae (15 patients), Streptococcus pyogenes (14 patients), Staphylococcus aureus (13 patients), Staphylococcus coagulase negative (three patients), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (eight patients), Haemophilus influenzae (four patients), Proteus mirabilis (two patients), Escherichia coli (two patients), Klebsiella pneumoniae (one patient), Enterobacter (one patient), Acinetobacter (one patient), anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (one patient), and fungi (two patients). Ten patients had mixed flora. Sixteen patients presented with complications (cerebellar abscess, perisinus empyema, subdural abscess or empyema, extradural abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, lateral sinus thrombosis, bacterial meningitis, labyrinthitis, petrositis, or facial nerve palsy). CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic treatment cannot be considered an absolute safeguard against the development of acute mastoiditis. Early myringotomy for acute otitis media seems to decrease the incidence of complications. The distribution of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis differs from that in acute otitis media. Intracranial complications in acute mastoiditis are not rare. Because of the diversity of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis and the growing resistance of bacteria to the various antibiotics, all means to obtain a sample for culture prior to antibiotic treatment, including general anesthesia.
TI  - The orientation bias of Chi sequences is a general tendency of G-rich oligomers.
AB  - The Chi sequences are specific oligomers that stimulate DNA repair by homologous  recombination, and are different sequences in each organism. Approximately 75% of the copies of the Chi sequence (5'-GCTGGTGG-3') of Escherichia coli reside on the leading strand, and this orientation bias is often believed to be a consequence of the biological role of Chi sequences as the signal sequence of RecBCD pathway in DNA replication. However, our computer analysis found that many G-rich oligomers also show this asymmetric orientation pattern. The shift in the Chi orientation bias appears around the replication origin and terminus, but these locations are also coincident with the shift points in GC content or GC skew. We conducted the same analysis with the genome of Bacillus subtilis, and found that in addition to Chi, other G-rich oligomers show similar asymmetric orientation patterns, whose shift points were coincident with those of the GC skew. However, the genome of Haemophilus influenzae Rd, whose GC skew is not so pronounced, does not clearly show asymmetric orientation patterns of Chi or other G-rich oligomers. These results lead us to suggest that the uneven distribution of the Chi orientation between the two strands of the double helix is mostly due to the uneven distribution of G content (GC skew) and that the replication-related function of Chi sequences is not the primary factor responsible for the evolutionary pressure causing the orientation bias.
TI  - The influence of ATP on the association and unfolding of the tyrosine repressor ligand response domain of Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The secondary structure of the ligand response domain of the Haemophilus influenzae tyrosine repressor, TyrR(lrd), was investigated using CD spectroscopy which revealed 42.5% alpha-helix, 17.6% beta-sheet, and 39.9% loops. Quaternary structure analysis by fluorescence anisotropy showed that TyrR(lrd) is monomeric at a concentration of 100 nM to 2 microM but that the protein readily dimerizes in the presence of its natural ligand ATP. Equilibrium unfolding studies of TyrR(lrd) using guanidinium hydrochloride suggested a two-state model with no detectable stable intermediates. The unfolding transition monitored by CD spectroscopy was responsive to tyrosine and ATP resulting in a shift to higher denaturant concentrations in the presence of these ligands. Differential scanning calorimetry yielded melting temperatures, T(m), of 51.15 and 58.07 degrees C for the unliganded and for the ATP-liganded protein, respectively. ATP is thus proposed to be a major structural cofactor for the molecular architecture of TyrR(lrd).
TI  - Short interrupted palindromes on the extragenic DNA of Escherichia coli K-12, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis.
AB  - MOTIVATION: The importance of the various kinds of repetitive nucleotide sequences for the workings of bacterial DNA has been widely recognized. This work is concerned with the distribution of a particular group of repetitive sequences, the short-sequenced interrupted extragenic palindromes, on the genetic maps of Escherichia coli K-12, Haemophilus influenzae Rd and Neisseria meningitidis Z2491 and MC58. A tool has been developed based upon a statistical hypothesis test taking into account the markovian structure of random sequences in order to determine the non-random character of extragenic palindromes. RESULTS: Totals of 7631, 12904, 4722 and 5477 non-random short interrupted palindromes have been found on the E.coli, H.influenzae, and N.meningitidis serogroup A and serogroup B genomes, respectively. Their distribution patterns on the respective genomes vary according to the bacterial species considered. Based on their position on the genome, palindromes could be distinguished as those which integrate longer, repetitive sequences; those which stand in isolation, and still others are associated to specific genome sites. AVAILABILITY: The complete list of the observed palindromes is available at the site http://www/lncc.br/~atrv. CONTACT: atrv@lncc.br
TI  - Significance of fever in Jamaican patients with homozygous sickle cell disease.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cause and outcome of high fever in Jamaican children with homozygous sickle cell disease. DESIGN: Retrospective review of febrile episodes in a three year period (1 September 1993 to 31 August 1996). SETTING: Sickle cell clinic, an outpatient clinic in Kingston run by the Medical Research Council Laboratories (Jamaica). PATIENTS: Patients with homozygous sickle cell disease under 17 years of age presenting with an axillary temperature >/= 39.0 degrees C (102.4 degrees F). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnosis, death. RESULTS: There were 165 events in 144 patients (66 (45.8%) boys) with a median age of 6.1 years. Bacteraemia was found in 10 (6.1%) events (three Streptococcus pneumoniae, two Haemophilus influenzae type b, two Salmonella sp, one Escherichia coli, one Enterobacter sp, and one Acinetobacter sp), and urinary tract infections in four (2.4%). All cultures of cerebrospinal fluid were sterile. Acute chest syndrome occurred in 36 (21.8%) events. A painful crisis was associated with 45 (27.3%) events and was the only pathology identified in 20 events (12.1%). Hospital admission was necessary in 66 cases including all those with bacteraemia and 31 with acute chest syndrome. There were two deaths: a 5 year old boy with septic shock associated with H influenzae septicaemia, and a 3 year old boy with the acute chest syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Painful crisis and acute chest syndrome were the most common complications associated with high fever, but other important associated features included bacteraemia and urinary tract infection. Enteric Gram negative organisms accounted for 50% of positive blood cultures.
TI  - Identification of a plasmid-encoded gene from Haemophilus ducreyi which confers NAD independence.
AB  - Members of the family Pasteurellaceae are classified in part by whether or not they require an NAD supplement for growth on laboratory media. In this study, we demonstrate that this phenotype can be determined by a single gene, nadV, whose presence allows NAD-independent growth of Haemophilus influenzae and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. This gene was cloned from a 5.2-kb plasmid which was previously shown to be responsible for NAD independence in Haemophilus ducreyi. When transformed into A. pleuropneumoniae, this cloned gene allowed NAD-independent growth on complex media and allowed the utilization of nicotinamide in place of NAD on defined media. Sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 1,482 bp that is predicted to encode a protein with a molecular mass of 55,619 Da. Compared with the sequence databases, NadV was found to have significant sequence homology to the human pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor PBEF and to predicted proteins of unknown function identified in the bacterial species Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Shewanella putrefaciens, Synechocystis sp., Deinococcus radiodurans, Pasteurella multocida, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. P. multocida and A. actinomycetemcomitans are among the NAD-independent members of the Pasteurellaceae. Homologues of NadV were not found in the sequenced genome of H. influenzae, an NAD-dependent member of the Pasteurellaceae, or in species known to utilize a different pathway for synthesis of NAD, such as Escherichia coli. Sequence alignment of these nine homologues revealed regions and residues of complete conservation that may be directly involved in the enzymatic activity. Identification of a function for this gene in the Pasteurellaceae should help to elucidate the role of its homologues in other species.
TI  - Evolutionary lability of context-dependent codon bias in bacteria.
AB  - In bacteria, synonymous codon usage can be considerably affected by base composition at neighboring sites. Such context-dependent biases may be caused by either selection against specific nucleotide motifs or context-dependent mutation biases. Here we consider the evolutionary conservation of context-dependent codon bias across 11 completely sequenced bacterial genomes. In particular, we focus on two contextual biases previously identified in Escherichia coli; the avoidance of out-of-frame stop codons and AGG motifs. By identifying homologues of E. coli genes, we also investigate the effect of gene expression level in Haemophilus influenzae and Mycoplasma genitalium. We find that while context-dependent codon biases are widespread in bacteria, few are conserved across all species considered. Avoidance of out-of-frame stop codons does not apply to all stop codons or amino acids in E. coli, does not hold for different species, does not increase with gene expression level, and is not relaxed in Mycoplasma spp., in which the canonical stop codon, TGA, is recognized as tryptophan. Avoidance of AGG motifs shows some evolutionary conservation and increases with gene expression level in E. coli, suggestive of the action of selection, but the cause of the bias differs between species. These results demonstrate that strong context-dependent forces, both selective and mutational, operate on synonymous codon usage but that these differ considerably between genomes.
TI  - Comparative activity of cefodizime and ceftriaxone against respiratory pathogens  in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model simulating concentration-time curves.
AB  - The duration of time that serum levels are above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC; T >MIC) seems to be an important pharmacodynamic parameter for beta-lactams. The aim of this study was to evaluate the bactericidal activity of cefodizime and ceftriaxone in a pharmacokinetic model mimicking the concentrations in bronchial mucus and in serum (total and free) obtained at 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h, after 1 g i.m. administration once daily. The species investigated were respiratory pathogens (1 strain of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 strain b-lactamase negative and 1 strain beta-lactamase positive of Haemophilus influenzae, 1 strain of Escherichia coli and 1 strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae); MIC50s of the chosen strains were reported. In this in vitro model the concentrations (serum and bronchial mucus) for both antibiotics are generally at or above the MIC values of the tested strains until 24 hours. The killing curve showed rapid killing for both antibiotics: 99.9% killing (a 3-log reduction in growth) within 6 to 8 h, depending upon the microorganism tested. There was no significant difference in the log kill between cefodizime and ceftriaxone. These data confirm that T >MIC for beta-lactams is the pharmacodynamic parameter which best correlates with bactericidal efficacy. On the basis of the killing curve determined for cefodizime versus ceftriaxone at concentrations that these antibiotics can reach during therapy with 1 g i.m. once daily we expect reasonable clinical efficacy with monoadministration of cefodizime as well as for ceftriaxone in respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Production and characterization of a new monoclonal antibody against Neisseria meningitidis: study of the cross-reactivity with different bacterial genera.
AB  - We have generated a hybridoma cell line which produces an 8C7Br1 clone of the IgM antibody isotype. It recognizes the 50-, 65-, and 60-kDa antigens and is reactive with strains of N. meningitidis in the 98% of local Neisseria genera by Dot-ELISA assays. Two percent of the strains of N. meningitidis B do not present reactivity with the 8C7Br1 monoclonal antibody (MAb). The antibody reacted against N. meningitidis of serogroups A, B, C, X, Y, Z, and different serotypes and subtypes of N. meningitidis B and C by means of Dot-ELISA and Immunoblot. It cross-reacted with Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria lactamica, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Bordetella pertussis, and Bacillus subtilis. The 8C7Br1 MAb reacted with the 65-kDa protein present in the prototype meningococcal strains B:16:B6(B2a:P1.5.2) and 2996 (B2b:P1.5.2). In H. influenzae type b, E. coli and B. subtilis, the MAb recognized the protein of 60, 65, and 70 kDa, respectively. FACS analysis showed that 8C7Brl MAb could recognize the 50-kDa protein on the surface of N. meningitidis homologous (B:4:P1.9) strain. These results, together with the bactericidal activity of 8C7Br1, and an experiment of passive protection in mice, demonstrated the potential importance of the cross-reactive protein as a candidate antigen for N. meningitidis B vaccine composition.
TI  - [Microorganisms isolated in cases of pertussis-like syndrome].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the etiologic study of the pertussis-like syndrome, not only as far as Bordetella genus is concerned but also regarding the causative role of other microorganisms for a 11-year period (1988-1998). METHODS: In all specimens from patients suffering from pertussis-like cough the presence of Bordetella spp., other bacteria, viruses, and mycoplasma was investigated. The analysed data included microbiological findings and epidemiologic issues (age, sex, hospital admission area, yearly distribution and seasonal period). RESULTS: A total of 1,063 specimens were investigated, most of them nasopharyngeal aspirates (910), corresponding to 905 patients; a positive culture was obtained form 56.9 of these patients. B. pertussis was isolated from 10.5% of patients. As for other bacteria, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were also isolated, in 16.9% and 15.8% of occasions, respectively. The respiratory syncitial virus was isolated from 10.7% of patients and other viruses in 9.4%. Among mycoplasma, Ureaplasma urealyticum predominated, with a recovery rate of 2.9%. The male/female ratio was 495/410; the ages of 67.2% of patients ranged from 0 to 6 months; a total of 689 (76.1%) required hospital admission. The recovery of B. pertussis and adenoviruses predominated during spring and summer months. In contrast, H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and respiratory syncitial virus were recovered more frequently during winter months. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with pertussis-like syndrome are children aged less than 6 months. The recovery percentages of B. pertussis and respiratory syncitial virus are identical and therefore we think that the investigation of their presence in this syndrome is fully warranted as well as the search for other microorganisms, since clinical symptoms are commonly non-specific among infants.
TI  - Identification of a lipopolysaccharide alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase from Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - We have identified a gene for the addition of N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) in an alpha-2,3-linkage to a lactosyl acceptor moiety of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of the human pathogen Haemophilus influenzae. The gene is one that was identified previously as a phase-variable gene known as lic3A. Extracts of H. influenzae, as well as recombinant Escherichia coli strains producing Lic3A, demonstrate sialyltransferase activity in assays using synthetic fluorescent acceptors with a terminal galactosyl, lactosyl or N-acetyl-lactosaminyl moiety. In the RM118 strain of H. influenzae, Lic3A activity is modulated by the action of another phase-variable glycosyltransferase, LgtC, which competes for the same lactosyl acceptor moiety. Structural analysis of LPS from a RM118:lgtC mutant and the non-typeable strain 486 using mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy confirmed that the major sialylated species has a sialyl-alpha-(2-3)-lactosyl extension off the distal heptose. This sialylated glycoform was absent in strains containing a lic3A gene disruption. Low amounts of sialylated higher molecular mass glycoforms were present in RM118:lgtC lic3A, indicating the presence of a second sialyltransferase. Lic3A mutants of H. influenzae strains show reduced resistance to the killing effects of normal human serum. Lic3A, encoding an alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase activity, is the first reported phase-variable sialyltransferase gene.
TI  - Recombination within natural populations of pathogenic bacteria: short-term empirical estimates and long-term phylogenetic consequences.
AB  - The identification of clones within bacterial populations is often taken as evidence for a low rate of recombination, but the validity of this inference is rarely examined. We have used statistical tests of congruence between gene trees to examine the extent and significance of recombination in six bacterial pathogens. For Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus, the congruence between the maximum likelihood trees reconstructed using seven house-keeping genes was in most cases no better than that between each tree and trees of random topology. The lack of congruence between gene trees in these four species, which include both naturally transformable and nontransformable species, is in three cases supported by high ratios of recombination to point mutation during clonal diversification (estimates of this parameter were not possible for Strep. pyogenes). In contrast, gene trees constructed for Hemophilus influenzae and pathogenic isolates of Escherichia coli showed a higher degree of congruence, suggesting lower rates of recombination. The impact of recombination therefore varies between bacterial species but in many species is sufficient to obliterate the phylogenetic signal in gene trees.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis dry extract.
AB  - In this study the antibacterial and antifungal properties of propolis, a natural  product of bees, have been investigated against different pathogens. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were determined according to NCCLS standards on 320 strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Time-kill curves were assessed for susceptible microorganisms, testing 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 x MIC for propolis, by counting viable bacteria after 0, 3, 6, 24 hours and viable yeasts after 0, 3, 6, 24 and 48 hours. Propolis showed good antimicrobial activity against most of the isolates, particularly S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis, but not against Enterobacteriaceae. Time-kill curves demonstrated bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal activity of propolis, the latter being evident only at high concentrations.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of L-084, a novel oral carbapenem,  against causative organisms of respiratory tract infections.
AB  - L-084 (a prodrug of LJC 11,036 [L-036]) is a new oral carbapenem. Here we compared the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of L-036 with those of imipenem, faropenem, ceditoren-pivoxil, cefdinir, amoxicillin, and levofloxacin. The MICs at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited of L-036 against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin-resistant organisms, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae including ampicillin-resistant organisms, Legionella pneumophila, and Moraxella catarrhalis were equal to or less than 1 microg/ml. In pharmacokinetics studies of L-084 in lungs of mice, the maximum concentration in serum, half-life, and area under the concentration-time curve of this drug were 9.09 microg/g of tissue, 6.18 h, and 31.0 microg. h/ml, respectively. In murine respiratory infection models of penicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, the efficacies of L-084 were better than those of reference drugs. Our results indicate that the in vitro high potency and good distribution in the lungs might be the underlying mechanisms of its efficacy in the murine model of pneumonia.
TI  - Mapping of binding domains of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae HMW1 and HMW2 adhesins.
AB  - Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae is an important cause of localized respiratory tract disease, which begins with colonization of the upper respiratory mucosa. In previous work we reported that the nontypeable H. influenzae HMW1 and HMW2 proteins are high-molecular-weight nonpilus adhesins responsible for attachment to human epithelial cells, an essential step in the process of colonization. Interestingly, although HMW1 and HMW2 share significant sequence similarity, they display distinct cellular binding specificities. In order to map the HMW1 and HMW2 binding domains, we generated a series of complementary HMW1-HMW2 chimeric proteins and examined the ability of these proteins to promote in vitro adherence by Escherichia coli DH5alpha. Using this approach, we localized the HMW1 and HMW2 binding domains to an approximately 360-amino-acid region near the N terminus of the mature HMW1 and HMW2 proteins. Experiments with maltose-binding protein fusion proteins containing segments of either HMW1 or HMW2 confirmed these results and suggested that the fully functional binding domains may be conformational structures that require relatively long stretches of sequence. Of note, the HMW1 and HMW2 binding domains correspond to areas of maximal sequence dissimilarity, suggesting that selective advantage associated with broader adhesive potential has been a major driving force during H. influenzae evolution. These findings should facilitate efforts to develop a subcomponent vaccine effective against nontypeable H. influenzae disease.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans thioredoxin (trx) gene and assessment of cytokine inhibitory activity.
AB  - Thioredoxin is a ubiquitous redox control and cell stress protein. Unexpectedly,  in recent years, thioredoxins have been found to exhibit both cytokine and chemokine activities, and there is increasing evidence that this class of protein plays a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. In spite of this evidence, it has been reported that the oral bacterium and periodontopathogen Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans secretes an immunosuppressive factor (termed suppressive factor 1 [SF1] [T. Kurita-Ochiai and K. Ochiai, Infect. Immun. 64:50-54, 1996]) whose N-terminal sequence, we have determined, identifies it as thioredoxin. We have cloned and expressed the gene encoding the thioredoxin of A. actinomycetemcomitans and have purified the protein to homogeneity. The A. actinomycetemcomitans trx gene has 52 and 76% identities, respectively, to the trx genes of Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae. Enzymatic analysis revealed that the recombinant protein had the expected redox activity. When the recombinant thioredoxin was tested for its capacity to inhibit the production of cytokines by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, it showed no significant inhibitory capacity. We therefore conclude that the thioredoxin of A. actinomycetemcomitans does not act as an immunosuppressive factor, at least with human leukocytes in cultures, and that the identity of SF1 remains to be elucidated.
TI  - Detection of bacterial virulence genes by subtractive hybridization: identification of capsular polysaccharide of Burkholderia pseudomallei as a major virulence determinant.
AB  - Burkholderia pseudomallei, the etiologic agent of melioidosis, is responsible for a broad spectrum of illnesses in humans and animals particularly in Southeast Asia and northern Australia, where it is endemic. Burkholderia thailandensis is a nonpathogenic environmental organism closely related to B. pseudomallei. Subtractive hybridization was carried out between these two species to identify genes encoding virulence determinants in B. pseudomallei. Screening of the subtraction library revealed A-T-rich DNA sequences unique to B. pseudomallei, suggesting they may have been acquired by horizontal transfer. One of the subtraction clones, pDD1015, encoded a protein with homology to a glycosyltransferase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This gene was insertionally inactivated in wild-type B. pseudomallei to create SR1015. It was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoelectron microscopy that the inactivated gene was involved in the production of a major surface polysaccharide. The 50% lethal dose (LD(50)) for wild-type B. pseudomallei is <10 CFU; the LD(50) for SR1015 was determined to be 3.5 x 10(5) CFU, similar to that of B. thailandensis (6.8 x 10(5) CFU). DNA sequencing of the region flanking the glycosyltransferase gene revealed open reading frames similar to capsular polysaccharide genes in Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Neisseria meningitidis. In addition, DNA from Burkholderia mallei and Burkholderia stabilis hybridized to a glycosyltransferase fragment probe, and a capsular structure was identified on the surface of B. stabilis via immunoelectron microscopy. Thus, the combination of PCR-based subtractive hybridization, insertional inactivation, and animal virulence studies has facilitated the identification of an important virulence determinant in B. pseudomallei.
TI  - Bacterial agents of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), beta-lactamase production, and resistance to antibiotics in elderly people. DEDALO Study Group.
AB  - This study determined the etiology of lower respiratory tract infections in the elderly and assessed whether the growth of beta-lactamase producing bacteria is particularly favoured in these patients. Between December 1998 and May 1999, 187 patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and 887 patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) were enrolled. The mean age was 74 years (range of 65-94 year). Sputum and bronchial aspirate for microbiological investigation were obtained. Besides organisms commonly involved in bacterial infections of the lower respiratory tract (i.e. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis), Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp. were also found. A high percentage of these bacteria were beta-lactamase producers. These data along with the clinical presentation, severity of infection, and epidemiological knowledge, might represent a guide for the choice of empiric antimicrobial treatment.
TI  - Transcriptional regulation of transport and utilization systems for hexuronides,  hexuronates and hexonates in gamma purple bacteria.
AB  - The comparative approach is a powerful tool for the analysis of gene regulation in bacterial genomes. It can be applied to the analysis of regulons that have been studied experimentally as well as that of regulons for which no known regulatory sites are available. It is assumed that the set of co-regulated genes and the regulatory signal itself are conserved in related genomes. Here, we use genomic comparisons to study the regulation of transport and utilization systems for sugar acids in gamma purple bacteria Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Yersinia pestis, Erwinia chrysanthemi, Haemophilus influenzae and Vibrio cholerae. The variability of the operon structure and the location of the operator sites for the main transcription factors are demonstrated. The common metabolic map is combined with known and predicted regulatory interactions. It includes all known and predicted members of the GntR, UxuR/ExuR, KdgR, UidR and IdnR regulons. Moreover, most members of these regulons seem to be under catabolite repression mediated by CRP. The candidate UxuR/ExuR signal is proposed, the KdgR consensus is extended, and new operators for all transcription factors are identified in all studied genomes. Two new members of the KdgR regulon, a hypothetical ATP-dependent transport system OgtABCD and YjgK protein with unknown function, are detected. The former is likely to be the transport system for the products of pectin degradation, oligogalacturonides.
TI  - Analysis of HI0220 protein from Haemophilus influenzae, a novel structural and functional analog of ArcB protein from Escherichia coli.
AB  - A Haemophilus influenzae gene encoding a protein with high homology to ArcB receptor protein from Escherichia coli has been cloned. An error in the previously reported sequence of this gene has been found, thus increasing its open reading frame. The cloned gene comprising the entire open reading frame restores oxygen-dependent regulation of succinate dehydrogenase in an ArcB-deficient E. coli strain. Thus, this gene is a functional analog of ArcB from E. coli. By screening partially sequenced bacterial genomes using the BLAST program, proteins with high homology to ArcB protein from E. coli were found in Salmonella typhi, Yersinia pestis, Vibrio cholerae, and Pasteurella multocida. Comparison of these proteins with ArcB protein from E. coli and H. influenzae revealed conserved amino acid regions. Transmembrane helix II was shown to be highly homologous in all the ArcB-type proteins. The involvement of this region in ArcB-mediated oxygen-dependent regulation is suggested.
TI  - Evolution of bacterial resistance to antibiotics during the last three decades.
AB  - Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is often plasmid-mediated and the associated  genes encoded by transposable elements. These elements play a central role in evolution by providing mechanisms for the generation of diversity and, in conjunction with DNA transfer systems, for the dissemination of resistances to other bacteria. At the University Hospital of Zaragoza, extensive efforts have been made to define both the dissemination and evolution of antibiotic resistance by studying the transferable R plasmids and transposable elements. Here we describe the research on bacterial resistance to antibiotics in which many authors listed in the references have participated. The aspects of bacterial resistance dealt with are: (i) transferable resistance mediated by R plasmids in Gram-negative bacteria, (ii) R plasmid-mediated resistance to apramycin and hygromycin in clinical strains, (iii) the transposon Tn1696 and the integron In4, (iv) expression of Escherichia coli resistance genes in Haemophilus influenzae, (v) aminoglycoside-modifying-enzymes in the genus Mycobacterium with no relation to resistance, and (vi) macrolide-resistance and new mechanisms developed by Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - A bioluminescent derivative of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 for deliberate release into the environment.
AB  - Recombinant derivatives of Pseudomonas putida strain KT2440 are of potential interest as microbial inoculants to be deliberately released for agricultural applications. To facilitate tracking of this strain and its derivatives after introduction into the environment, a mini-Tn5-'luxAB transposon was introduced into the chromosome of P. putida KT2440, yielding strain P. putida S1B1. Sequencing of the DNA region located upstream of the 'luxAB genes and similarity search with the P. putida KT2440 genome sequence, localized the transposon within a 3021-bp open reading frame (ORF), whose translated sequence showed significant similarity with the hypothetical YdiJ proteins from Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae. A second ORF adjacent to and divergent from the ydiJ sequence was also found and showed significant homology with various LysR-type transcriptional activator proteins from several bacteria. Disruption of the ydiJ locus in P. putida S1B1 did not affect the survival of the strain in unvegetated or vegetated soils. Bioluminescent detection of P. putida S1B1 cells enriched in selective media directly from soil allowed detection of culturable cells in soil samples over a period of at least 8 months. The addition of the luxAB biomarker facilitates tracking in the root system of several plant species grown under sterile and non-sterile conditions. The correlation of the bioluminescent phenotype with the growth activity of P. putida S1B1 cells colonizing the root system of barley and corn plants was estimated by monitoring ribosomal contents using quantitative hybridization with fluorescence-labeled ribosomal RNA probes. A correlation between inoculum density, light output, and ribosomal contents was found for P. putida cells colonizing the root system of barley seedlings grown under sterile conditions. Although ribosomal contents, and therefore growth activity, of P. putida S1B1 cells extracted from the rhizosphere of corn plants grown in non-sterile soil were similar to those found in starved cells, the luminescent system permitted non-destructive in situ detection of the strain in the upper root system.
TI  - Crystal structure of the bacterial protein export chaperone secB.
AB  - SecB is a bacterial molecular chaperone involved in mediating translocation of newly synthesized polypeptides across the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria. The crystal structure of SecB from Haemophilus influenzae shows that the molecule is a tetramer organized as a dimer of dimers. Two long channels run along the side of the molecule. These are bounded by flexible loops and lined with conserved hydrophobic amino acids, which define a suitable environment for binding non-native polypeptides. The structure also reveals an acidic region on the top surface of the molecule, several residues of which have been implicated in binding to SecA, its downstream target.
TI  - The promiscuous and specific sides of SecB.

TI  - Evaluation of the Antimicrobial Activity of Sparfloxacin, Relative to Other Oral  Antibiotics Against 1,125 Bacterial Isolates from 10 Medical Centers in Brazil.
AB  - A multicenter study was carried out in order to compare the in vitro activity of  sparfloxacin to ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cephalexin, cefuroxine and azithromycin, against 1,125 microorganisms recently isolated from clinical specimens, most of them representative of respiratory tract infections. Sparfloxacin demonstrated potent action and was more active than the beta-lactam agents and azithromycin against most of the bacterial strains tested. Sparfloxacin was more potent (96% and 95% sensitivity, with MIC(90) of 0.19microg/mL and 0.5microg/mL, respectively)than the other antimicrobial agents tested against the Enterobacteriaceae family (Escherichia coli and Elebsiella pneumoniae). It was found to be equivalent in activity to ciprofloxacin (96% and 91% sensitivity and MIC(90) of 0.25 and 0.75microg/mL, respectively). Sparfloxacin was also found to be very active against the most fastidious microorganisms commonly associated to respiratory tract infections such as the penicillin-susceptible and resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0.5microg/mL and 0.38microg/mL, respectively), ampicillin-susceptible and -resistant Haemophilus influenzae (MIC(90) 0.016microg/mL and 0.38microg/mL, respectively), beta-lactamase producing Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC(90) 0.032microg/mL) and non beta-lactamase producing M.catarrhalis (MIC(90) 0.5microg/mL).
TI  - The NAD-dependent ligase encoded by yerG is an essential gene of Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - DNA ligases are grouped into two families, ATP-dependent and NAD-dependent, according to the cofactor required for their activity. A surprising capability of both kinds of ligases to complement for one another in vivo has been observed. Bacillus subtilis harbours one NAD-dependent ligase, YerG, and two ATP-dependent ligases, YkoU and YoqV, this last one being encoded by the 134 kb lysogenic bacteriophage SPss and consisting of a single adenylation domain typical of ATP-dependent ligases. Because the genetics of ligases in B.subtilis had not been studied previously, the genes encoding for one ligase of each kind, yerG and yoqV, were investigated. We found that the yerG gene was essential in B.subtilis. This suggests that none of the ATP-dependent ligases was able to complement the yerG defect. In addition, the ATP-dependent ligase encoded by yoqV, when cloned on a plasmid under appropriate expression signals, was unable to rescue a yerG mutant strain. The two B.subtilis ligase genes yerG and yoqV were also introduced in an Escherichia coli strain encoding a thermosensitive ligase (ligts), and whereas yoqV did not complement the ligts defects, yerG fully complemented the growth and UV sensitivity defects of the lig mutant. We propose to rename the yerG and yoqV genes of B.subtilis ligA and ligB respectively.
TI  - Vaccination in Travelers.
AB  - Vaccination of populations throughout the world has led to dramatic decreases in  morbidity and mortality from many infectious diseases, including poliomyelitis and measles. In the United States, for example, morbidity and mortality from invasive disease from Haemophilus influenzae type b has decreased more than 99%. International travelers should ensure that they are up-to-date on their routine immunizations and then consider vaccination against other diseases based on risk. This article reviews new vaccines such as those against rotavirus, Lyme disease, and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and provides updated information on the risk of typhoid fever and the efficacy of vaccination against it. The use of hepatitis A vaccine in outbreak control, the safety of yellow fever vaccine, and the importance of protecting travelers against rabies exposure are also discussed. Vaccination is an important way for travelers to maintain their health before, during, and after travel.
TI  - Comparative In Vitro Activities of Moxifloxacin (Bay 12-8039) and Other Antimicrobial Agents Against Respiratory Tract Pathogens in Brazil.
AB  - Clinical isolates of respiratory tract pathogens were susceptibility tested against six different antimicrobial agents. The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of levofloxacin, cefaclor, amoxicillin-clavulanate acid, azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against 111 isolates, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and other species isolated from respiratory tract infections. All isolates were susceptible to moxifloxacin, except for two isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa which showed intermediate-resistance (MIC=6microg/mL), and one isolate of Escherichia coli which showed resistance (MIC>32microg/mL). Only moxifloxacin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were active against 100% of S. pneumoniae isolates at the suceptible breakpoint (MIC90, 0.25 microg/mL and 0.064 microg/mL respectively). The rank order of the activity among this group of drugs against S. pneumoniae was as follows (% of susceptibility): moxifloxacin = amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (100%) > levofloxacin (97%) > cefaclor (71%) > trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (54%) > azithromycin (53%). Except for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, all antimicrobial agents were 100% active against H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. The fluoroquinolones, moxifloxacin and levofloxacin, were the most potent compounds against these pathogens (MIC(90) 0.032 0.19 microg/mL). These in vitro susceptibility testing data of moxifloxacin support the view that this fluoroquinolone will have an important therapeutic role in the treatment of respiratory tract diseases.
TI  - Regulation of competence development in Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Development of competence for DNA uptake by the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae  is tightly regulated, and expression of the cell's complement of competence genes is absolutely dependent on the cAMP-CRP complex. A second regulator of competence may maximize competence under starvation conditions. Several investigators have recently identified a consensus sequence (competence regulatory element, CRE) in the promoter regions of some competence genes and have proposed that this may be a binding site for Sxy (TfoX), a putative positive regulator of competence. However, a scoring method that reliably ranks candidate binding sites according to affinity for the cognate binding protein predicts that the cAMP-CRP complex will bind CRE sequences with high affinity. Moreover, the predicted Sxy protein lacks recognizable DNA-binding motifs and has not been shown to bind DNA. No other consensus sequences (putative binding sites) were identified in the promoter regions of competence genes. These observations suggest that the proposed competence-specific regulatory elements are in fact CRP-binding sites, and highlight the central role of cAMP-an established bacterial mediator of the response to nutritional stress-in competence regulation. Minor sequence elements uniquely conserved in the set of CRE sequences are predicted to reduce CRP affinity, and a model is suggested in which a secondary regulator of competence genes may interact with CRP under certain conditions to stabilize the initiation complex.
TI  - Genomic Analysis of the Genes Encoding Ribosomal Proteins in Eight Eubacterial Species and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
AB  - The complete genomic nucleotide sequence data of more than 10 unicellular organisms have become available. During the past years, we have been focusing our attention to the analysis of the structure and function of the ribosome and its protein components. By making use of the genomic sequence data, our work can now be extended to comparative analysis of the ribosomal components at the genomic level. Such analysis will contribute to our understanding of the structure-function relationship of the ribosome that is vital to the expression of genetic information. Bearing these in mind, the ribosomal protein genes of organisms whose genomic sequence data are available were analyzed, which included Aquifex aeolicus; Archaeoglobus fulgidus; Borrelia burgdorferi; Bacillus subtilis; Escherichia coli; Haemophilus influenzae; Helicobacter pylori; Methanococcus jannaschii; Mycoplasma genitalium; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; Synechosystis sp., and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In addition, the amino acid sequence data of Bacillus stearothermophilus ribosomal proteins were used in the evolutionary evaluation. The results indicate that, in eubacteria including two species of Mycoplasma, the operon structure of ribosomal protein genes is well conserved, while their relative orientation and chromosomal location are diverged into several classes. The operon structure in M. jannaschii on the other hand is quite different from the eubacterial one and we noticed that its many genes show similarity to rat ribosomal protein genes. The degrees of sequence conservation differ from one ribosomal protein gene to another, but several genes encoding proteins that are considered to be of structural importance are conserved throughout the bacterial species including archaebacteria and further in S. cerevisiae.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of piperacillin in several fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - We investigated activity of piperacillin (PIPC) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. The following results were obtained: 1. PIPC had its MIC90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in Gram-positive bacteria (Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis) and showed its MIC of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible PRSP strains out of 38 isolates of S. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. PIPC showed favorable antibacterial activities as its MIC90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae), except for P. mirabilis in which its MIC90 was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of P. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as PIPC, ABPC, CTM and CZOP. 3. PIPC had its MIC90 of > 128 micrograms/ml in Bacteroides fragilis. From these results, PIPC was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when 20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.
TI  - Ecological antibiotic policy.
AB  - Development of resistance to antibiotics is a major problem worldwide. The normal oropharyngeal flora, the intestinal flora and the skin flora play important roles in this development. Within a few days after the onset of antibiotic therapy, resistant Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus epidermidis can be detected in the normal flora of volunteers or patients. Horizontal spread of the resistance genes to other species, e.g. Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, occurs by conjugation or transformation. An ecologically sound antibiotic policy favours the use of antibiotics with little or no impact on the normal flora. Prodrug antibiotics which are not active against the bacteria in the mouth and the intestine (before absorption) and which are not excreted to a significant degree via the intestine, saliva or skin are therefore preferred. Prodrugs such as pivampicillin, bacampicillin, pivmecillinam and cefuroxime axetil are favourable from an ecological point of view. Experience from Scandinavia supports this, since resistance to mecillinam after 20 years of use is low (about 5%) and stable.
TI  - ACI-1 from Acidaminococcus fermentans: characterization of the first beta-lactamase in Anaerobic cocci.
AB  - Acidaminococcus fermentans belongs to the group of strictly anaerobic gram-negative cocci. All previously described Acidaminococcus strains are susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. An A. fermentans strain (RYC-MR95) resistant to penicillin and expanded-spectrum cephalosporin (amoxicillin and cefotaxime MICs, 64 microgram/ml) was isolated from a human perianal abscess. A fragment encoding a beta-lactamase from genomic DNA was cloned in Escherichia coli K-12 strain HB101, and the recombinant strain expressed resistance to amoxicillin (MIC, 1,024 microgram/ml) and cefotaxime (MIC, 4 microgram/ml). Clavulanic acid decreased the MICs to 8 and 0.03 microgram/ml, respectively. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed a new class A beta-lactamase, ACI-1. In accordance with its biochemical properties, we propose to assign ACI-1 to functional group 2be. The ACI-1 enzyme (estimated pI 4.3) had <50% amino acid identity with any other class A beta-lactamases, the closest being ROB-1 from Haemophilus influenzae (44%). ACI-1 was closer to class A beta-lactamases from some gram-positive organisms (41 to 44% amino acid identity with Bacillus beta-lactamases) than to most class A enzymes from gram-negative organisms (TEM-1, 24.6%). The aci1 gene had a G+C content of 42.1%, in contrast with 56% G+C content for genomic DNA from A. fermentans, thus suggesting that aci1 may have been obtained by horizontal gene transfer.
TI  - Expression of peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein is required for virulence in the human model of Haemophilus ducreyi infection.
AB  - Haemophilus ducreyi expresses a peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (PAL) that exhibits extensive homology to Haemophilus influenzae protein 6. We constructed an isogenic PAL mutant (35000HP-SMS4) by the use of a suicide vector that contains lacZ as a counterselectable marker. H. ducreyi 35000HP-SMS4 and its parent, 35000HP, had similar growth rates in broth and similar lipooligosaccharide profiles. 35000HP-SMS4 formed smaller, more transparent colonies than 35000HP and, unlike its parent, was hypersensitive to antibiotics. Complementation of the mutant in trans restored the parental phenotypes. To test whether expression of PAL is required for virulence, nine human volunteers were experimentally infected. Each subject was inoculated with two doses (41 to 89 CFU) of live 35000HP and one dose of heat-killed bacteria on one arm and with three doses (ranging from 28 to 800 CFU) of live 35000HP-SMS4 on the other arm. Papules developed at similar rates at sites inoculated with the mutant or parent but were significantly smaller at mutant-inoculated sites than at parent-inoculated sites. The pustule formation rate was 72% (95% confidence interval [CI], 46.5 to 90.3%) at 18 parent sites and 11% (95% CI, 2.4 to 29.2%) at 27 mutant sites (P < 0.0001). The rates of recovery of H. ducreyi from surface cultures were 8% (n = 130; 95% CI, 4.3 to 14.6%) for parent-inoculated sites and 0% (n = 120; 95% CI, 0.0 to 2.5%) for mutant-inoculated sites (P < 0.001). H. ducreyi was recovered from six of seven biopsied parent-inoculated sites and from one of three biopsied mutant-inoculated sites. Confocal microscopy confirmed that the bacteria present in a mutant inoculation site pustule lacked a PAL-specific epitope. Although biosafety regulations precluded our testing the complemented mutant in humans, these results suggest that expression of PAL facilitates the ability of H. ducreyi to progress to the pustular stage of disease.
TI  - The Haemophilus influenzae Hia adhesin is an autotransporter protein that remains uncleaved at the C terminus and fully cell associated.
AB  - Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae is a gram-negative commensal organism that is  commonly associated with localized respiratory tract disease. The pathogenesis of disease begins with colonization of the nasopharynx, a process that likely depends on bacterial adherence to respiratory epithelial cells. Hia is the major adhesin expressed by a subset of nontypeable H. influenzae strains and promotes efficient adherence to a variety of human epithelial cell lines. Based on previous work, Hia is transported to the surface of Escherichia coli transformants and is capable of mediating E. coli adherence without the assistance of other H. influenzae proteins. In the present study, we examined the mechanism of Hia secretion. PhoA fusions, deletional mutagenesis, and N-terminal amino acid sequencing established that the signal for Hia export from the cytoplasm resides in the first 49 amino acids, including a 24-amino-acid stretch with striking similarity to the N terminus of a number of proteins belonging to the autotransporter family. Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that the Hia internal region defined by amino acids 221 to 779 is exposed on the bacterial surface. Secondary-structure analysis predicted that the C terminus of Hia forms a beta-barrel with a central hydrophilic channel, and site-specific mutagenesis and fusion protein analysis demonstrated that the C terminus targets Hia to the outer membrane and functions as an outer membrane translocator, analogous to observations with autotransporter proteins. In contrast to typical autotransporter proteins, Hia undergoes no cleavage between the internal and C-terminal domains and remains fully cell associated. Together, these results suggest that Hia is the prototype of an important subfamily of autotransporter proteins.
TI  - Vibrio fischeri lipopolysaccharide induces developmental apoptosis, but not complete morphogenesis, of the Euprymna scolopes symbiotic light organ.
AB  - During initiation of the association between the squid host Euprymna scolopes and its bacterial partner Vibrio fischeri, the bacteria induce dramatic morphogenesis of the host symbiotic organ, a portion of which involves the signaling of widespread apoptosis of the cells in a superficial ciliated epithelium on the colonized organ. In this study, we investigated the role in this process of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial cell-surface molecule implicated in the induction of animal cell apoptosis in other systems. Purified V. fischeri LPS, as well as the LPS of V. cholerae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Shigella flexneri, added in the concentration range of pg/ml to ng/ml, induced apoptosis in epithelial cells 10- to 100-fold above background levels. The absence of species specificity suggested that the conserved lipid A portion of the LPS was the responsible component of the LPS molecule. Lipid A from V. fischeri, E. coli, or S. flexneri induced apoptosis. In addition, strains of H. influenzae carrying a mutation in the htrB gene, which is involved in the synthesis of virulent lipid A, showed a diminished ability to induce apoptosis of host cells. Confocal microscopy using fluorescently labeled LPS indicated that the LPS behaves similar to intact bacterial symbionts, interacting with host cells in the internal crypt spaces and not directly with the superficial epithelium. Although LPS was able to induce apoptosis, it did not induce the full morphogenesis of the ciliated surface, suggesting that multiple signals are necessary to mediate the development of this animal-bacterial mutualism.
TI  - Genome rearrangement by replication-directed translocation.
AB  - Gene order in bacteria is poorly conserved during evolution. For example, although many homologous genes are shared by the proteobacteria Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae and Helicobacter pylori, their relative positions are very different in each genome, except local functional clusters such as operons. The complete sequences of the more closely related bacterial genomes, such as pairs of Chlamydia, H. pylori and Mycobacterium species, now allow identification of the processes and mechanisms involved in genome evolution. Here we provide evidence that a substantial proportion of rearrangements in gene order results from recombination sites that are determined by the positions of the replication forks. Our observations suggest that replication has a major role in directing genome evolution.
TI  - Characterization and expression of HmuR, a TonB-dependent hemoglobin receptor of  Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - The gram-negative pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis requires hemin for growth. Hemoglobin bound to haptoglobin and hemin complexed to hemopexin can be used as heme sources, indicating that P. gingivalis must have a means to remove the hemin from these host iron-binding proteins. However, the specific mechanisms utilized by P. gingivalis for the extraction of heme from heme-binding proteins and for iron transport are poorly understood. In this study we have determined that a newly identified TonB-dependent hemoglobin-hemin receptor (HmuR) is involved in hemoglobin binding and utilization in P. gingivalis A7436. HmuR shares amino acid homology with TonB-dependent outer membrane receptors of gram-negative bacteria involved in the acquisition of iron from hemin and hemoglobin, including HemR of Yersinia enterocolitica, ShuA of Shigella dysenteriae, HpuB of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis, HmbR of N. meningitidis, HgbA of Haemophilus ducreyi, and HgpB of H. influenzae. Southern blot analysis confirmed the presence of the hmuR gene and revealed genetic variability in the carboxy terminus of hmuR in P. gingivalis strains 33277, 381, W50, and 53977. We also identified directly upstream of the hmuR gene a gene which we designated hmuY. Upstream of the hmuY start codon, a region with homology to the Fur binding consensus sequence was identified. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that hmuR and hmuY were cotranscribed and that transcription was negatively regulated by iron. Inactivation of hmuR resulted in a decreased ability of P. gingivalis to bind hemoglobin and to grow with hemoglobin or hemin as sole iron sources. Escherichia coli cells expressing recombinant HmuR were shown to bind hemoglobin and hemin. Furthermore, purified recombinant HmuR was demonstrated to bind hemoglobin. Taken together, these results indicate that HmuR serves as the major TonB-dependent outer membrane receptor involved in the utilization of both hemin and hemoglobin in P. gingivalis.
TI  - Preclinical pharmacology of GAR-936, a novel glycylcycline antibacterial agent.
AB  - GAR-936 is an analog of minocycline, a semisynthetic derivative of tetracycline.  It has broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro and in vivo. The new class of tetracyclines to which GAR-936 belongs is named the glycylcyclines. Tetracyclines act by inhibiting protein translation in bacteria, presumably by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit and blocking entry of amino-acyl transfer RNA molecules into the A site of the ribosome. This prevents incorporation of amino acid residues into elongating peptide chains. In general, tetracyclines are considered bacteriostatic and the critical therapeutic parameter is the area under the concentration-time curve. GAR-936 has bactericidal activity; at 4 times the minimum inhibitory concentration, a 2- to 3-log reduction in colony counts was seen against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. GAR-936 is active against the antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacteria methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. It is most significant that GAR-936 and other glycylcyclines are active against bacterial strains carrying either or both of the two major forms of tetracycline resistance: efflux and ribosomal protection. Using isogenic panels of bacteria carrying various tetracycline-resistance determinants, a series of more than 300 analogs was tested for antibacterial activity, which allowed for structure-activity relationships to be determined. Results indicated that certain substituents at the 9 position of the tetracycline molecule restored activity against bacteria harboring genes encoding either or both efflux and ribosomal protection. A single chemical modification overcame the two molecularly distinct forms of resistance while maintaining activity against susceptible gram-positive, gram-negative, aerobic, and anaerobic bacteria. Although mutants can be generated that are less susceptible to previously studied glycylcyclines, only marginal differences in susceptibility to GAR-936 were noted. Therefore, whereas emergence of resistance to any widely administered antibiotic is a foregone conclusion, resistance to GAR-936 will not readily arise by trivial mutations in existing resistance genes.
TI  - Novel beta -hydroxyacid dehydrogenases in Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Our laboratory has previously reported a structurally and mechanistically related family of beta-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases with significant homology to beta-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase. A large number of the members of this family are hypothetical proteins of bacterial origin with unknown identity in terms of their substrate specificities and metabolic roles. The Escherichia coli beta-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase homologue corresponding to the locus was cloned and expressed with a 6-histidine tag for specific purification. The purified recombinant protein very specifically catalyzed the NAD(+)-dependent oxidation of d-glycerate and the NADH-dependent reduction of tartronate semialdehyde, identifying this protein as a tartronate semialdehyde reductase. Further evidence for identification as tartronate semialdehyde reductase is the observation that the coding region for this protein is directly preceded by genes coding for hydroxypyruvate isomerase and glyoxylate carboligase, two enzymes that synthesize tartronate semialdehyde, producing an operon clearly designed for d-glycerate biosynthesis from tartronate semialdehyde. The single beta-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase homologue from Haemophilus influenzae was also cloned, expressed, and purified with a 6-histidine tag. This protein also catalyzed the NAD(+)-dependent oxidation of d-glycerate but was significantly more efficient in the oxidation of four-carbon beta-hydroxyacids like d-hydroxybutyrate and d-threonine. This enzyme differs from all the presently known beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenases which are well established members of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily.
TI  - Etiologic spectrum and pattern of antimicrobial drug susceptibility in bacterial  meningitis in Sokoto, Nigeria.
AB  - Etiologic agents of meningitis were prospectively investigated among patients admitted to Usman Danfodio University Teaching Hospital, Sokoto. Of 1097 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples submitted to the microbiology laboratory from various wards of the hospital, 289 (26%) were microscopically, culturally and/or serologically proven to be bacterial meningitis. The etiologic spectrum was as follows: Neisseria meningitidis (61%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (18%), Haemophilus influenzae (10%), Staphylococcus aureus (6%), Coliform bacilli (3%), Escherichia coli (0.7%), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (0.7%), Listeria monocytogenes (0.4%), Flavobacterium meningosepticum (0.4%) and Pseudomonas putrifasciens (0.4%). Bacterial meningitis was most prevalent (195 or 68%) among children aged 1-9 y, while adults and neonates were least affected. Coliform bacilli caused five of eight neonatal cases. Males were more frequently affected than females (chi2 = 12.50; p < 0.05). Culture and microscopy were comparatively less efficient than the search for bacterial antigens, especially in the diagnosis of Haemophilus meningitis. Antimicrobial susceptibility of N. meningitidis to ampicillin and benzyl penicillin reduced progressively over the years (F = 406.98; p < 0.001). Nineteen (11%) of the isolates (5 Meningococci, 7 Staph. aureus, 1 Haem. influenza and 6 others) showed simultaneous resistance to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and benzyl penicillin.
TI  - Ecological antibiotic policy.
AB  - Development of resistance to antibiotics is a major problem worldwide. The normal oropharyngeal flora, the intestinal flora and the skin flora play important roles in this development. Within a few days after the onset of antibiotic therapy, resistant Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus epidermidis can be detected in the normal flora of volunteers or patients. Horizontal spread of the resistance genes to other species, e.g. SALMONELLA: spp., Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, occurs by conjugation or transformation. An ecologically sound antibiotic policy favours the use of antibiotics with little or no impact on the normal flora. Prodrug antibiotics which are not active against the bacteria in the mouth and the intestine (before absorption) and which are not excreted to a significant degree via the intestine, saliva or skin are therefore preferred. Prodrugs such as pivampicillin, bacampicillin, pivmecillinam and cefuroxime axetil are favourable from an ecological point of view. Experience from Scandinavia supports this, since resistance to mecillinam after 20 years of use is low (about 5%) and stable.
TI  - Genetic footprinting with mariner-based transposition in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The complete DNA sequence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa provides an opportunity to apply functional genomics to a major human pathogen. A comparative genomics approach combined with genetic footprinting was used as a strategy to identify genes required for viability in P. aeruginosa. Use of a highly efficient in vivo mariner transposition system in P. aeruginosa facilitated the analysis of candidate genes of this class. We have developed a rapid and efficient allelic exchange system by using the I-SceI homing endonuclease in conjunction with in vitro mariner mutagenesis to generate mutants within targeted regions of the P. aeruginosa chromosome for genetic footprinting analyses. This technique for generating transposon insertion mutants should be widely applicable to other organisms that are not naturally transformable or may lack well developed in vivo transposition systems. We tested this system with three genes in P. aeruginosa that have putative essential homologs in Haemophilus influenzae. We show that one of three H. influenzae essential gene homologs is needed for growth in P. aeruginosa, validating the practicality of this comparative genomics strategy to identify essential genes in P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Predicted highly expressed genes of diverse prokaryotic genomes.
AB  - Our approach in predicting gene expression levels relates to codon usage differences among gene classes. In prokaryotic genomes, genes that deviate strongly in codon usage from the average gene but are sufficiently similar in codon usage to ribosomal protein genes, to translation and transcription processing factors, and to chaperone-degradation proteins are predicted highly expressed (PHX). By these criteria, PHX genes in most prokaryotic genomes include those encoding ribosomal proteins, translation and transcription processing factors, and chaperone proteins and genes of principal energy metabolism. In particular, for the fast-growing species Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, Bacillus subtilis, and Haemophilus influenzae, major glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle genes are PHX. In Synechocystis, prime genes of photosynthesis are PHX, and in methanogens, PHX genes include those essential for methanogenesis. Overall, the three protein families-ribosomal proteins, protein synthesis factors, and chaperone complexes-are needed at many stages of the life cycle, and apparently bacteria have evolved codon usage to maintain appropriate growth, stability, and plasticity. New interpretations of the capacity of Deinococcus radiodurans for resistance to high doses of ionizing radiation is based on an excess of PHX chaperone-degradation genes and detoxification genes. Expression levels of selected classes of genes, including those for flagella, electron transport, detoxification, histidine kinases, and others, are analyzed. Flagellar PHX genes are conspicuous among spirochete genomes. PHX genes are positively correlated with strong Shine-Dalgarno signal sequences. Specific regulatory proteins, e.g., two-component sensor proteins, are rarely PHX. Genes involved in pathways for the synthesis of vitamins record low predicted expression levels. Several distinctive PHX genes of the available complete prokaryotic genomes are highlighted. Relationships of PHX genes with stoichiometry, multifunctionality, and operon structures are discussed. Our methodology may be used complementary to experimental expression analysis.
TI  - 3-Deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) transferase (WaaA) and kdo kinase (KdkA) of Haemophilus influenzae are both required to complement a waaA knockout mutation of Escherichia coli.
AB  - The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of the deep rough mutant Haemophilus influenzae I69  consists of lipid A and a single 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) residue substituted with one phosphate at position 4 or 5 (Helander, I. M., Lindner, B., Brade, H., Altmann, K., Lindberg, A. A., Rietschel, E. T., and Zahringer, U. (1988) Eur. J. Biochem. 177, 483-492). The waaA gene encoding the essential LPS-specific Kdo transferase was cloned from this strain, and its nucleotide sequence was identical to H. influenzae DSM11121. The gene was expressed in the Gram-positive host Corynebacterium glutamicum and characterized in vitro to encode a monofunctional Kdo transferase. waaA of H. influenzae could not complement a knockout mutation in the corresponding gene of an Re-type Escherichia coli strain. However, complementation was possible by coexpressing the recombinant waaA together with the LPS-specific Kdo kinase gene (kdkA) of H. influenzae DSM11121 or I69, respectively. The sequences of both kdkA genes were determined and differed in 25 nucleotides, giving rise to six amino acid exchanges between the deduced proteins. Both E. coli strains which expressed waaA and kdkA from H. influenzae synthesized an LPS containing a single Kdo residue that was exclusively phosphorylated at position 4. The structure was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of deacylated LPS. Therefore, the reaction products of both cloned Kdo kinases represent only one of the two chemical structures synthesized by H. influenzae I69.
TI  - Prediction of transcription terminators in bacterial genomes.
AB  - This study describes an algorithm that finds rho-independent transcription terminators in bacterial genomes and evaluates the accuracy of its predictions. The algorithm identifies terminators by searching for a common mRNA motif: a hairpin structure followed by a short uracil-rich region. For each terminator, an energy-scoring function that reflects hairpin stability, and a tail-scoring function based on the number of U nucleotides and their proximity to the stem, are computed. A confidence value can be assigned to each terminator by analyzing candidate terminators found both within and between genes, and taking into account the energy and tail scores. The confidence is an empirical estimate of the probability that the sequence is a true terminator. The algorithm was used to conduct a comprehensive analysis of 12 bacterial genomes to identify likely candidates for rho-independent transcription terminators. Four of these genomes (Deinococcus radiodurans, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae and Vibrio cholerae) were found to have large numbers of rho-independent terminators. Among the other genomes, most appear to have no transcription terminators of this type, with the exception of Thermotoga maritima. A set of 131 experimentally determined E. coli terminators was used to evaluate the sensitivity of the method, which ranges from 89 % to 98 %, with corresponding false positive rates of 2 % and 18 %.
TI  - Increased disease burden and antibiotic resistance of bacteria causing severe community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected children.
AB  - To improve the management of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected children, we assessed the burden of disease, clinical outcome and antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria causing severe community-acquired LRTI in children. A prospective, descriptive study was performed in the pediatric wards at a secondary and tertiary care hospital in South Africa. Urban black children aged 2-60 months admitted with severe acute LRTI from March 1997 through February 1998 were enrolled. HIV-1 infection was present in 45.1% of 1215 cases of severe LRTI. Bacteremia occurred in 14.9% of HIV-1-infected and in 6.5% of HIV-1-uninfected children (P<.00001). The estimated relative incidence of bacteremic severe LRTI in children aged from 2 to 24 months were greater in HIV-1-infected than in -uninfected children for Streptococcus pneumoniae (risk ratio [RR], 42.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 20.7-90.2), Haemophilus influenzae type b (RR, 21.4; 95% CI, 9.4-48.4), Staphylococcus aureus (RR, 97.9; 95% CI, 11.4-838.2) and Escherichia coli (RR, 49.0; 95% CI, 15.4-156). Isolation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was also more common in HIV-1-infected than in -uninfected children (RR, 22.5; 95% CI, 13.4-37.6). In HIV-1-infected children, 60% of S. aureus and 85.7% of E. coli isolates were resistant to methicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, respectively. The case-fatality rates among HIV-1-infected children was 13.1%, and among HIV-1-uninfected children, 2.1% (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]; 6.52, 95% CI, 3.53-12.05; P<.00001). The changing spectrum of bacteria and antibiotic susceptibility patterns in HIV-1-infected children requires a reevaluation of the empirical treatment of community-acquired severe LRTI in children from developing countries with a high prevalence of childhood HIV-1 infection.
TI  - Cloning of genes of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae involved in penetration between human lung epithelial cells.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae penetrates between epithelial cells via an unknown mechanism. A chromosomal library of nonencapsulated H. influenzae strain A960053 DNA was constructed in Escherichia coli DH5alpha to identify bacterial genes contributing to this paracytosis. Two E. coli clones that contained open reading frames (ORFs) homologous to HI0636 to HI0641 of H. influenzae strain Rd and that showed an increased penetration in epithelial cell layers of the human bronchial epithelial cell line NCI-H292 were identified. ORFs HI0636 and HI0638, encoding two small proteins of unknown functions, were further investigated. The clone containing ORFs HI0636 and HI0637 as well as the clone containing ORF HI0638 showed a significant increase in penetration. Disruption of HI0638 by kanamycin box insertion in H. influenzae strain A960053 resulted in loss of penetration into the epithelial cell layers. Disruption of HI0636 had no effect on penetration in this model system. Since a role for HI0637 in the paracytosis of H. influenzae is very unlikely because it encodes TrpS, we conclude that the protein encoded by ORF HI0638 may function as a paracytin, while that encoded by HI0636 may have an auxiliary function.
TI  - Identification and characterisation of a novel conserved outer membrane protein from Neisseria meningitidis.
AB  - We have identified a homologue of the adhesin AIDA-I of Escherichia coli in Neisseria meningitidis. This gene was designated nhhA (Neisseria hia homologue), as analysis of the complete coding sequence revealed that it is more closely related to the adhesins Hia and Hsf of Haemophilus influenzae. The sequence of nhhA was determined from 10 strains, and found to be highly conserved. Studies of the localisation by Western immunoblot analysis of total cell proteins and outer membrane complex preparations and by immunogold electron microscopy revealed that NhhA is located in the outer membrane. A strain survey showed that nhhA is present in 85/85 strains of N. meningitidis representative of all the major disease-associated serogroups, based on Southern blot analysis. It is expressed in the majority of strains tested by Western immunoblot.
TI  - Organization and transcription of the division cell wall (dcw) cluster in Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  - A cluster of genes involved in cell division and cell wall (dcw) biosynthesis was identified in Neisseria gonorrhoeae using genomic analysis and through verification of gene order by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. The gonococcal dcw cluster consists of 17 genes, in the order 5'-mraZ-mraW-ftsI-murE-hyp1-murF- mraY-hyp2-murD-ftsW-murG-murC-ddl -ft sQ-ftsA-ftsZ-hyp3-3'. The gene organization of the dcw cluster of N. gonorrhoeae is more similar to that observed in Gram-negative rods such as Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae than in Gram-positive bacteria. The cluster is characterized by several intergenic spaces. Compared with E. coli, two genes, ftsL and envA, are absent in the gonococcal dcw cluster and three hypothetical genes are novel to the cluster. The cluster is flanked by two transcriptional terminators consisting of paired neisserial uptake sequences and also includes four internal terminators, three of which are paired neisserial uptake sequences. We also found that a repeated sequence on the gonococcal genome, commonly called a Correia element, acts as the fourth transcriptional terminator. All termination sequences were shown to be fully functional by using reverse transcription PCR experiments. Transcriptional start sites upstream of ftsQ, ftsA and ftsZ were determined by primer extension and six promoters were identified; three promoters were located upstream of ftsZ in the intergenic space, two were upstream of ftsA within ftsQ and one was upstream of ftsQ within ddl. Some of these promoters were preferentially used under anaerobic conditions. The location of these promoters differed from those described in E. coli indicating dissimilar transcriptional regulation.
TI  - Hydroxamic acid derivatives as potent peptide deformylase inhibitors and antibacterial agents.
AB  - Low-molecular-weight beta-sulfonyl- and beta-sulfinylhydroxamic acid derivatives  have been synthesized and found to be potent inhibitors of Escherichia coli peptide deformylase (PDF). Most of the compounds synthesized and tested displayed antibacterial activities that cover several pathogens found in respiratory tract infections, including Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. The potential of these compounds as antibacterial agents is discussed with respect to selectivity, intracellular concentrations in bacteria, and potential for resistance development.
TI  - Respiratory pathogen colonization of the dental plaque of institutionalized elders.
AB  - Although it has been established that aspiration of pharyngeal bacteria is the major route of infection in the development of nosocomial pneumonia, colonization of the pharyngeal mucosa by respiratory pathogens has been shown to be a transient phenomenon. It has been suggested that the dental plaque may constitute an additional, possibly more stable, reservoir of respiratory pathogens. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of oral colonization by potential respiratory pathogens in a group of elderly (mean age = 75.9 yrs) chronic-care-facility residents (n = 28) and a group of age-, gender-, and race-matched outpatient control subjects (n = 30), with specific attention to plaque present on tooth, denture, and oral mucosal surfaces. Plaque scores on teeth and dentures were significantly higher in the chronic-care-facility (CCF) subjects than in the dental outpatient control (DOC) subjects (PII 2.3 vs. 1.2 and denture plaque 1.4 vs. 0.3). While no subjects in the DOC group were found to be colonized with respiratory pathogens (> 1.0% of the cultivable aerobic flora), 14.3% (4/28) of the CCF subjects were found to be colonized. Oral colonization with respiratory pathogens in CCF subjects was associated with the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and higher plaque scores. These results suggest that deficient dental plaque control and the presence of COPD may be related to respiratory pathogen colonization of dental plaque in chronic-care-facility residents.
TI  - Detection of phase variation in expression of proteins involved in hemoglobin and hemoglobin-haptoglobin binding by nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae can utilize different protein-bound forms of heme for growth in vitro. A previous study (I. Maciver, J. L. Latimer, H. H. Liem, U. Muller-Eberhard, Z. Hrkal, and E. J. Hansen. Infect. Immun. 64:3703-3712, 1996) indicated that nontypeable H. influenzae (NTHI) strain TN106 expressed a protein that bound hemoglobin-haptoglobin and was encoded by an open reading frame (ORF) that contained a CCAA nucleotide repeat. Southern blot analysis revealed that several NTHI strains contained between three and five chromosomal DNA fragments that bound an oligonucleotide probe for CCAA repeats. Three ORFs containing CCAA repeats were identified in NTHI strain N182; two of these ORFs were arranged in tandem. The use of translational fusions involving these three ORFs and the beta-lactamase gene from pBR322 revealed that these three ORFs, designated hgbA, hgbB, and hgbC, encoded proteins that could bind hemoglobin, hemoglobin-haptoglobin, or both compounds. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for the HgbA, HgbB, and HgbC proteins were produced by immunizing mice with synthetic peptides unique to each protein. Both HgbA and HgbB were readily detected by Western blot analysis in N182 cells grown in the presence of hemoglobin as the sole source of heme, whereas expression of HgbC was found to be much less abundant than that of HgbA and HgbB. The use of these MAbs in a colony blot radioimmunoassay analysis revealed that expression of both HgbA and HgbB was subject to phase variation. PCR and nucleotide sequence analysis were used in conjunction with Western blot analyses to demonstrate that this phase variation involved the CCAA repeats in the hgbA and hgbB ORFs.
TI  - Sialic acid metabolism's dual function in Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Many bacterial commensals and pathogens use the sialic acids as carbon and nitrogen sources. In Escherichia coli, the breakdown of these sugars is catalysed by gene products of the nan (Nacylneuraminate) operon; other microorganisms may use a similar catabolic strategy. Despite the known ligand and antirecognition functions of the sialic acids, the contribution of their catabolism to infection or host colonization has never been directly investigated. We addressed these questions with Haemophilus influenzae type b, which metabolizes relatively few carbohydrates, using the infant-rat infection model. The predicted H. influenzae homologue (HI0142) of the E. coli sialic acid aldolase structural gene, nanA, was subcloned and mutagenized by insertion of a kanamycin resistance cassette. Phenotypic investigation of the resulting H. influenzae aldolase mutants showed that: (i) HI0142 is essential for sialic acid degradation; (ii) the products of the open reading frames (ORFs) flanking HI0142 (HI0140, 41, 44 and 45) are likely to have the same functions as those of their counterparts in E. coli; (iii) sialylation of the lipooligosaccharide (LOS) epitope recognized by monoclonal antibody 3F11 is dependent on an environmental source of sialic acid; (iv) a nanA mutant hypersialylates its LOS sialyl acceptor, corresponding to an apparent increased fitness of the mutant in the infant-rat model; and (v) expression of the LOS sialyl acceptor is altered in cells grown without exogenous sialic acid, indicating the direct or indirect effect of sialic acid metabolism on LOS antigenicity. Taken together the data show the dual role of sialic acid catabolism in nutrition and cell surface modulation.
TI  - [A study of bacterial meningitis in Hokkaido between 1994 and 1998].
AB  - We evaluated 82 children with bacterial meningitis in 78 institutions in Hokkaido, Japan between 1994 and 1998. The mean number of cases per year was 16.4 (range, 9 to 30). A male predominance occurred with 52 males and 30 females (1.7:1). Median age was 11 months with a range from 1 day to 11 years. Seventy-eight (95%) of the total were less than 5 years old with 55 (67%) less than 2 years old and 45 (55%) less than 1-year old. Four deaths occurred, giving an overall case fatality rate of 4.9%. Sequelae were seen at discharge in 29%, predominantly sensorineural hearing loss, epilepsy and development delay of varying severity. The main causative organisms were Haemophilus influenzae in 49 patients, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 14, Streptococcus agalactiae in 10 and Escherichia coli in 5. The frequency of poor prognosis was 50% for patients with meningitis due to S. pneumoniae or S. agalactiae compared with 27% for patients with meningitis due to H. influenzae.
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - [In vitro activity of faropenem against beta-lactamase producing clinical isolates].
AB  - Each 20 strains of beta-lactamase producing methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, and Bacteroides fragilis group were used as the test strains. Drug susceptibility of these strains to faropenem (FRPM), cefdinir, cefditoren, cefcapene, cefteram, cefaclor, and ampicillin was determined by an agar dilution method according to the NCCLS guideline M100-S9. beta-Lactamase activity of the test strains was determined by a spectrophotometric method. In the present study, FRPM was highly active against beta-lactamase-producing strains, and no close correlation was found between the MICs of FRPM for the test strains and their beta-lactamase activities. These results suggest that FRPM has potential in successful application for the treatment of infectious diseases with various types of bacterial pathogens including beta-lactamase producing strains.
TI  - Gene cloning, sequencing, and inactivation of the branched-chain aminotransferase of Lactococcus lactis LM0230.
AB  - A branched-chain aminotransferase gene (ilvE) from Lactococcus lactis LM0230 was  identified on a 9-kb chromosomal insert by complementation in Escherichia coli DL39. Sequencing of a 2.0-kbp fragment resulted in the identification of a 1,023-bp open reading frame that could encode a 340-amino-acid protein. Sequence analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed 62% identity to IlvE of Haemophilus influenzae and high similarity to IlvEs from a variety of organisms found in GenBank classified as class IV aminotransferases. Under logarithmic growth in complex medium, ilvE is transcribed monocistronically as a 1.1-kb transcript. Hydrophobicity plot analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence and the lack of a signal peptide sequence suggest IlvE is a cytosolic protein. A derivative of LM0230 lacking IlvE activity was constructed by gene replacement. Comparison of the IlvE-deficient strain's ability to grow in defined media lacking an amino acid but containing its alpha-keto acid biosynthetic precursor to that of the wild-type strain indicated that IlvE is the only enzyme capable of synthesis of Ile and Val from their biosynthetic precursors. Comparison of the aminotransferase activity of the IlvE mutant to LM0230 revealed that the mutant retained <2, 4.5, 43, 40, and 76% of its aminotransferase activity with Ile, Val, Leu, Met, and Phe, respectively. No difference in growth or acidification rate between LM0230 and the IlvE-deficient strain was observed in milk.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the USA.
AB  - The antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (SB-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 Gram-positive and 995 Gram-negative organisms collected from various USA sites. Time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0. 016 mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/L), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/L), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.03 mg/L), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/L), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/L). Against Gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. MIC(90)s for gemifloxacin were: Haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/L), Escherichia coli (0.016 mg/L), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/L), Enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/L), Proteus spp. (4 mg/L), Serratia spp. (1 mg/L), Citrobacter freundii (2 mg/L), Morganella morganii (0.12 mg/L), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/L), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/L). Gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x MIC. The PAE for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at 2 and 4 x MIC, although longer PAEs were observed with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x MIC) and shorter PAEs with E. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and K. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). In conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. It has substantially improved potency against Gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. It retains the good Gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged PAEs.
TI  - Pilus-mediated adherence of Haemophilus influenzae to human respiratory mucins.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae, especially the nontypeable strains, are among the most common pathogens encountered in patients with chronic lung disease and otitis media. We and others have demonstrated that respiratory isolates of nontypeable H. influenzae bind to human mucins, but the mechanism of binding is not entirely clear. We have therefore examined the role of pili in the adherence of both type b and nontypeable H. influenzae to human respiratory mucins. We used isogenic H. influenzae strains with a mutation in the structural gene for pilin (hifA), a laboratory H. influenzae strain transformed with a type b pilus gene cluster (from strain C54), antibodies raised against H. influenzae HifA, and Escherichia coli strains carrying a cloned type b pilus gene cluster (from strain AM30) in these studies. All bacteria lacking HifA or the pilus gene cluster had decreased adherence of piliated H. influenzae to mucins, and Fab fragments of anti-HifA antibodies inhibited the adherence. E. coli strains carrying the cloned type b pilus gene cluster were six to seven times more adhesive than strains carrying the vector. The role of other putative adhesins was not examined and thus cannot be excluded, but these studies support a role for pili in the binding of H. influenzae to human respiratory mucins.
TI  - Molecular characterization and functional analysis of a secA gene homolog in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Results of Southern blot analyses and polymerase chain reaction revealed that the Gram-negative pathogen, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, harbored DNA homologous to the secA gene of Escherichia coli. In E. coli, the secA gene product is essential for translocation of proteins across the inner membrane via the Sec system. This A. actinomycetemcomitans secA homolog was cloned and its nucleotide sequence determined. Amino acid sequence analysis of the cloned gene revealed significant homology to the SecA proteins of Haemophilus influenzae, E. coli, Caulobacter crescentus and Bacillus subtilis. Although the cloned gene did not complement a temperature sensitive mutation in the E. coli secA gene, strains harboring the cloned gene did produce a protein that cross-reacted with anti-SecA antibody. In addition, the cloned gene did restore sensitivity to sodium azide in an E. coli azide mutant. These data support the hypothesis that A. actinomycetemcomitans may use a system similar to the Sec system of E. coli to transport proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane, but suggest that the A. actinomycetemcomitans gene product may require genera-specific Sec proteins to complement some Sec mutations in E. coli.
TI  - [Descriptive study of infectious ear disease in relation to summer].
AB  - A descriptive study was made of infectious ear disease (including diffuse otitis  externa, otomycosis, acute-on-chronic otitis media, and superinfection of a radical mastoidectomy cavity) in relation to changes of weather and habits in summer. During the months of June, July, and August 1996, 179 patients were evaluated in the emergency room of the Alicante General University Hospital, Spain. Average patient age at presentation was 30.52 (+/- 20.08) years and 56% were men. The most frequent disease was diffuse otitis externa (78%) followed by acute-on-chronic otitis media (12%), otomycosis (8%), and superinfection of a radical mastoidectomy cavity (2%). The most frequently involved microorganisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa in diffuse otitis externa, Aspergillus niger and Candida in otomycosis, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus in acute-on-chronic otitis media. Patients were treated by cleaning detritus and secretions, usually followed by topical antibiotics for a maximum period of one week.
TI  - Stimulation of bacterial adherence by neutrophil defensins varies among bacterial species but not among host cell types.
AB  - Adherence of Haemophilus influenzae to bronchial epithelial cells is enhanced by  neutrophil defensins, which are released from activated neutrophils during inflammation [Gorter et al. (1998) J. Infect. Dis. 178, 1067-1078]. In this study, we showed that the adherence of H. influenzae to various epithelial, fibroblast-like and endothelial cell types was significantly enhanced by defensins (20 microg ml(-1)). Defensins stimulated also the adherence of Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria meningitidis and nonencapsulated Streptococcus pneumoniae to the NCI-H292 cell line. In contrast, defensins did not affect the adherence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, encapsulated S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis. These results suggest that the defensin-enhanced adherence might support the adherence and possibly persistence of the selected bacterial species using the respiratory tract as port of entry.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin against 873 clinical isolates from respiratory tract, urinary tract and surgical infections during 1997-1998 in Japan.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gatifloxacin was determined for 873 isolates from various infections during 1997-1998 in Japan. Gatifloxacin was active against streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, with MIC(90)s of </=0.39 mg/L. The activity was two- to 32-fold greater than that of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria, and comparable to that against Gram-negative bacteria. Gatifloxacin was more active than the other quinolones against quinolone-resistant staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae. It also had good activity against penicillin- or macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae.
TI  - Meningitis antigen detection: interpretation of agglutination by ultrasound-enhanced latex immunoassay.
AB  - Detailed instructions for performance and interpretation of ultrasound-enhanced latex agglutination tests for the rapid identification of bacteria causing meningitis are described. This recently developed technique, which enhances the sensitivity of most latex immunoagglutination assays, has been studied mainly in the context of detection of antigens of meningitis-causing bacteria. The test concentrates on the Wellcogen bacterial antigen kit (Murex Diagnostics Ltd) that contains five latex suspensions specific for Haemophilus influenzae type b, Neisseria meningitidis ACYW135, N. meningitidis B/Escherichia coli K1, Streptococcus group B and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Light photomicrographs of positive agglutination are shown. Particular attention is paid to the appearance of the latex in negative control samples following exposure to ultrasound. Guidance is given on interpretation and assessment in clinical samples.
TI  - The role of blood group antigens in infectious diseases.
AB  - The medical literature contains a large number of publications attempting to correlate blood groups with disease. Many of these reports are poorly documented and have limited scientific validity. Only a few agents, such as malaria parasites and parvovirus B19, infect red blood cells (RBCs) and precursors. Most other agents use RBCs as carriers to the target tissue. There is an excess of blood group A individuals among cancer patients compared with normal individuals; malignancy has also been associated with the Lewis antigen. Plasmodium vivax only enters RBCs when the Fy6 Duffy protein is present. Certain Escherichia coli organisms will only attach to epithelial cells carrying P or Dr blood group antigens. The P antigen Is also the receptor for parvovirus B19. Le(b) appears to be the receptor for Helicobacter pylori in gastric tissue. The high frequency blood group antigen AnWJ is the receptor for Haemophilus influenzae. Knowledge of the functions of RBC surface molecules Is expanding and the ability to generate experimental animals devoid of certain molecules will clarify their physiological role.
TI  - Analysis of the complete nucleotide sequence of the tetracycline-resistance transposon Tn10.
AB  - An analysis of the complete nucleotide sequence of the composite tetracycline-resistance transposon Tn10 (9147 bp) from the Salmonella typhi conjugative plasmid R27 is presented. A comparison of the protein sequences from IS10-right and IS10-left transposases has identified four amino acid differences. These residues appear to play an important role in normal transposase function and may account for the differences in exhibited transposition activities. The tetracycline determinants encoded by this version of Tn10 share >99% identity with those of Tn10(R100), demonstrating the conservation that exists between these transposons. A previously uncharacterized approximately 3000-bp region of Tn10 contains four putative open reading frames. One of these open reading frames shares 55% identity with the glutamate permease protein sequence from Haemophilus influenzae although it was unable to complement an Escherichia coli glutamate permease mutant, with which it shares 51% identity. The three remaining putative open reading frames are arranged as a discrete genetic unit adjacent to the glutamate permease homolog and are transcribed in the opposite direction. Two of these open reading frames are homologous with Bacillus subtilis proteins of unknown functions while the other has no homologs in the database. The presence of an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase class II motif in one of these open reading frames in combination with the glutamate permease homolog allows us to postulate that this region of Tn10 could once have played a role in amino acid metabolism.
TI  - Identification of a Haemophilus influenzae 5'-nucleotidase protein: cloning of the nucA gene and immunogenicity and characterization of the NucA protein.
AB  - We report on the identification of a surface-exposed, highly conserved, immunogenic nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) protein, which elicits cross-reactive bactericidal antibodies against NTHi. The protein was extracted from NTHi strain P860295 with KSCN and purified; it migrated as a single band on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel with an apparent molecular mass of 63 kDa. Mouse antiserum generated against the purified protein was reactive on whole-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with seven NTHi strains and type b Eagan and Whittier strains and exhibited bactericidal activity to homologous and heterologous NTHi strains. However, the protein is made in small amounts in NTHi as corroborated by immunoelectron microscopy. To further study this protein, we cloned, sequenced, and expressed it recombinantly in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein is localized in the periplasm of E. coli and has been purified to homogeneity. Both the recombinant and native proteins possess 5'-nucleotidase activity; hence, the protein has been called NucA. Mouse antiserum directed against the recombinant NucA protein was reactive on Western immunoblots and whole-cell ELISA with all H. influenzae strains tested including Eagan and was bactericidal for two heterologous strains tested. The antiserum also resulted in a log reduction in bacteremia, in an infant-rat protection study with H. influenzae type b as the challenge strain. These features suggest that NucA is a potential subunit vaccine candidate against NTHi disease.
TI  - comB, a novel competence gene required for natural transformation of Acinetobacter sp. BD413: identification, characterization, and analysis of growth-phase-dependent regulation.
AB  - Here we describe five tandemly arranged and converging ORFs in Acinetobacter sp.  BD413, namely lytB, orfY, orfX, comB, and orfZ, located upstream of the previously identified competence gene comC. The N-termini of the deduced proteins OrfY and ComB exhibit the conserved endopeptidase cleavage motifs of prepilin proteins; the deduced protein ComB is similar to type IV pilins. LytB is similar to the Escherichia coli LytB, which has been implicated in the stringent response. No homologues of OrfX, OrfY and OrfZ could be identified. A mutation in orfY or orfZ led to 100-fold reduced transformation frequencies and a mutation in comB resulted in a non-competent phenotype. Disruption of lytB did not affect the natural transformation phenotype. Complementation studies clearly demonstrated that comB is involved in natural transformation, whereas the transformation-deficient phenotypes of orfY and orfZ mutants were due to polar effects on comB and comC, respectively. Analyses of the twitching motility phenotype and of the ultrastructure of the noncompetent comB mutant suggested that the competence gene comB is not essential for the biogenesis of type IV pili and expression of the type IV pili-associated property of twitching motility. Transcriptional fusions between comB and a promoter-free lacZ gene were constructed, and analysis of growth-phase-dependent transcription revealed increased expression of comB during prolonged exponential and stationary phases.
TI  - Maturation and secretion of the non-typable Haemophilus influenzae HMW1 adhesin:  roles of the N-terminal and C-terminal domains.
AB  - Non-typable Haemophilus influenzae is a common cause of human disease and initiates infection by colonizing the upper respiratory tract. The non-typable H. influenzae HMW1 and HMW2 adhesins mediate attachment to human epithelial cells, an essential step in the process of colonization. HMW1 and HMW2 have an unusual N-terminus and undergo cleavage of a 441-amino-acid N-terminal fragment during the course of their maturation. Following translocation across the outer membrane, they remain loosely associated with the bacterial surface, except for a small amount that is released extracellularly. In the present study, we localized the signal sequence to the first 68 amino acids, which are characterized by a highly charged region from amino acids 1-48, followed by a more typical signal peptide with a predicted leader peptidase cleavage site after the amino acid at position 68. Additional experiments established that the SecA ATPase and the SecE translocase are essential for normal export and demonstrated that maturation involves cleavage first between residues 68 and 69, via leader peptidase, and next between residues 441 and 442. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that HMW1 processing, secretion and extracellular release are dependent on amino acids in the region between residues 150 and 166 and suggested that this region interacts with the HMW1B outer membrane translocator. Deletion of the C-terminal end of HMW1 resulted in augmented extracellular release and elimination of HMW1-mediated adherence, arguing that the C-terminus may serve to tether the adhesin to the bacterial surface. These observations suggest that the HMW proteins are secreted by a variant form of the general secretory pathway and provide insight into the mechanisms of secretion of a growing family of Gram-negative bacterial exoproteins.
TI  - Evidence for donor strand complementation in the biogenesis of Haemophilus influenzae haemagglutinating pili.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae haemagglutinating pili are surface appendages that promote attachment to host cells and facilitate respiratory tract colonization, an essential step in the pathogenesis of disease. In contrast to other well-characterized forms of pili, H. influenzae haemagglutinating pili are two-stranded helical structures. Nevertheless, haemagglutinating pili are assembled by a pathway that involves a periplasmic chaperone and an outer membrane usher, analogous to the prototype pathway involved in the biogenesis of Escherichia coli P pili. In this study, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of the H. influenzae HifB chaperone and HifA major pilus subunit at positions homologous to sites important for chaperone-subunit interactions and subunit oligomerization in P pili. Mutations at putative subunit binding pocket residues in HifB or at the penultimate tyrosine in HifA abolished formation of HifB-HifA periplasmic complexes, whereas mutations at the -14 glycine in HifA had no effect on HifB-HifA interactions but abrogated HifA oligomerization. To define further the constraints of the interaction between HifA and HifB, we examined the interchangeability of pilus gene cluster components from H. influenzae type b strain Eagan (hifA-hifEEag) and the related H. influenzae biogroup aegyptius strain F3031 (hifA-hifEF3031). Functional pili were assembled both with HifAEag and the strain F3031 gene cluster and with HifAF3031 and the strain Eagan gene cluster, underscoring the flexibility of the H. influenzae chaperone/usher pathway in incorporating HifA subunits with significant sequence diversity. To gain additional insight into the interactive surfaces of HifA and HifB, we aligned HifA sequences from 20 different strains and then modelled the HifA structure based on the recently crystallized PapD-PapK complex. Analysis of the resulting structure revealed high levels of sequence conservation in regions predicted to interact with HifB, and maximal sequence diversity in regions potentially exposed on the surface of assembled pili. These results suggest broad applicability of structure-function relationships identified in studies of P pili, including the concepts of donor strand complementation and donor strand exchange. In addition, they provide insight into the structure of HifA and suggest a basis for antigenic variation in H. influenzae haemagglutinating pili.
TI  - Serum amyloid P component bound to gram-negative bacteria prevents lipopolysaccharide-mediated classical pathway complement activation.
AB  - Although serum amyloid P component (SAP) is known to bind many ligands, its biological function is not yet clear. Recently, it was demonstrated that SAP binds to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In the present study, SAP was shown to bind to gram-negative bacteria expressing short types of LPS or lipo-oligosaccharide (LOS), such as Salmonella enterica serovar Copenhagen Re and Escherichia coli J5, and also to clinical isolates of Haemophilus influenzae. It was hypothesized that SAP binds to the bacteria via the lipid A part of LPS or LOS, since the htrB mutant of the nontypeable H. influenzae strain NTHi 2019-B29-3, which expresses a nonacetylated lipid A, did not bind SAP. This was in contrast to the parental strain NTHi 2019. The binding of SAP resulted in a clear inhibition of the deposition of complement component C3 on the bacteria. SAP inhibited only the activation of the classical complement pathway; the alternative route remained unaffected. In the classical route, SAP prevented the deposition of the first complement component, Clq, probably by interfering with the binding of Clq to LPS. Since antibody-mediated Clq activation was not inhibited by SAP, SAP seems to inhibit only the LPS-induced classical complement pathway activation. The SAP-induced inhibition of C3 deposition strongly diminished the complement-mediated lysis as well as the phagocytosis of the bacteria. The binding of SAP to gram-negative bacteria, therefore, might influence the pathophysiology of an infection with such bacteria.
TI  - Polypurine.polypyrimidine sequences in complete bacterial genomes: preference for polypurines in protein-coding regions.
AB  - The genomes of Methanococcus jannaschii, Mycoplasma genitalium, Haemophilus influenzae, Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Helicobacter pylori, Treponema pallidum, Borrelia burgdorferri, Rickettsia prowazekeii, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, Bacillus subtilis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Pyrococcus horikoshii, Aquifex aeolicus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Escherichia coli have been analysed for the presence of polypurine.polypyrimidine tracts, in order to understand their distribution in these genomes. We observed a variation in abundance of such sequences in these bacteria, with the archaeal genomes forming a high-abundance group and the canonical eubacteria forming a low-abundance group. The genomes of M. tuberculosis and A. aeolicus are unique among the organisms analysed here in the abnormal underrepresentation and overrepresentation of polypurine.polypyrimidine, respectively. We also observe a strand bias, i.e., a preferential occurrence of polypurines in coding strands. It varies widely among the bacteria, from the very high bias in M. jannaschii to the slightly inverse bias in the parasitic genomes of T. pallidum and C. trachomatis. The extent of strand bias, however, cannot be explained on the basis of the GC-content of the genome, use of all-purine codons or an excess in the amino acids that are encoded by such codons. The probable causes and effects of this phenomenon are discussed.
TI  - Identification and analysis of the sap genes from Vibrio fischeri belonging to the ATP-binding cassette gene family required for peptide transport and resistance to antimicrobial peptides.
AB  - Partial nucleotide sequences of the sapD and sapF genes of the sap operon (GenBank Accession No. AF178651) from Vibrio fischeri ATCC 7744 have been determined, and the peptide transport system of ATP-binding proteins SapD and SapF encoded by the genes have been deduced. Alignment and comparison of the Sap proteins of V. fischeri, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Haemophilus influenzae Rd show that these proteins are homologous. The sap operon residing in the genome enables V. fischeri to transport peptides and resist antimicrobial peptides. Nucleotide sequence and functional analyses confirm that the specific regulatory-region-like sequence R&R* that resides inside the sapD gene and before the sapF gene functions in gene expression and regulation; also, it is regulated by the LuxR-AI complex of the V. fischeri lux regulon. The putative upstream activator binding sequences SigmaUASI, SigmaUASII, SigmaUASIII TGTCGACTTGGGCCTCGCTGTCCGTATGCACA (72nd to 103rd bp), TGTCCGTATGCACA (90th to 103rd bp), and TGTTCAAGTACCAGAAAGACA (111st to 133rd bp) in the R&R* sequence, which are similar to the two-component regulator binding sequence TGT-N(8-12)-ACA and the LuxR-AI binding sequence ACCTGTAGGATCGTACAGGT in the regulatory region of the V. fischeri lux regulon, might be the specific sequences recognized by the LuxR-AI complex for enhancement.
TI  - The nose as bacterial reservoir: important differences between the vestibule and  cavity.
AB  - The difference between the spectra of potential bacterial pathogens (PBPs) in the nasal vestibule and cavity has not been taken into account in clinical studies. PURPOSE: Since one can anticipate different flora in different kinds of mucosae, the authors compared bacterial species in the vestibule with those of the cavity. SUBJECTS AND METHOD: A total of 534 healthy male clerical workers in a downtown Lucerne office building were examined with fractionated swabs. RESULTS: PBPs, notably Staphylococcus aureus, were found in 412 subjects and surprisingly, differences in flora of the two sites were noted in 130 of them: PBPs were observed in the vestibule and not in the cavity in 85 of the subjects, and in 45 of them, the reverse was true. CONCLUSION: The practical implications of these findings are considerable regarding infection control in patients at increased infection risk.
TI  - [In vitro activity of biapenem (BIPM) against clinically isolated respiratory pathogens in 1996-1998].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of biapenem (BIPM), a new carbapenem antibiotic, was compared with those of imipenem (IPM), panipenem (PAPM), meropenem (MEPM), ceftazidime (CAZ) and piperacillin (PIPC) against 280 isolates of 9 respiratory pathogens. The MIC90s of biapenem (BIPM) for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae were 0.12, 32, 0.25, 0.06, 4 and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively. In comparison with other antibiotics, the activity of biapenem (BIPM) for P. aeruginosa was as potent as meropenem (MEPM), but for H. influenzae it was slightly less than those of other antibiotics, and for other respiratory pathogens it was as potent as those of other antibiotics. The MIC90s of biapenem (BIPM) for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens were 0.06, 1, 1, 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively, and which were equal to or somewhat lower than those of other antibiotics. Biapenem (BIPM) showed strong activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, especially P. aeruginosa in general. Based on these results, biapenem (BIPM) is seemed to be highly useful antibiotic for the treatment of respiratory infections with several organism.
TI  - Gram-negative bacillary bacteremia in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: HIV-infected children are particularly susceptible to serious bacterial infections including Gram-negative bacillary bacteremia (GNB). However, the information available on GNB in these children is limited. METHODS: Retrospective review of hospital charts of HIV-infected children with GNB diagnosed between 1980 and 1997. The association between bacteremic episodes, degree of immunosuppression, HIV severity, medical treatment and clinical outcome was assessed. RESULTS: Of 680 HIV-infected children, 72 (10.6%) had 95 episodes of GNB. Statistical analyses were restricted to data from the first episode. The mean age (+/-SD) at diagnosis of GNB was 2.5 +/- 2.7 years (median, 1.6). The predominant organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (26.4%), nontyphoidal Salmonella (15.3%), Escherichia coli (15.3%) and Haemophilus influenzae (12.5%). The relative frequency, per 5-year interval, of P. aeruginosa bacteremia steadily increased from 13% during 1980 through 1984 to 56% during 1995 through 1997. There were no cases of H. influenzae bacteremia after January 1, 1990. Eighty percent of GNB developed in children with AIDS and 72.2% developed in those with severe immunosuppression. Hypogamma-globulinemia and neutropenia were present in only 4.9 and 10.4% of first episodes, respectively. The overall case-fatality rate of GNB was 43.0%, and in children younger than 12 months it was 54.2%. CONCLUSIONS: A diagnosis of AIDS and/or severe immunosuppression was associated with increased risk of GNB, especially among younger children. Because of the high mortality of GNB, a broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy that effectively covers these organisms should be promptly instituted when bacteremia is suspected in HIV-infected children.
TI  - Stable shuttle vectors for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus spp. and other bacteria based on a single origin of replication.
AB  - An origin of replication (ori) was obtained from a naturally occurring beta-lactamase-producing plasmid isolated from Neisseria gonorrhoeae and used to construct shuttle vectors capable of replicating in N. gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus ducreyi, Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli. Using the gonococcal proAB genes, we complemented proline-requiring N. gonorrhoeae F62 and E. coli HB101 in trans. The first demonstration of the expression of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in either N. gonorrhoeae or H. ducreyi was shown using this vector, indicating that GFP may be a useful tool in the analysis of these organisms. This is the first report of a gonococcal vector based on a broad host range, genetically defined ori, and should facilitate the molecular analysis of gonococcal and Haemophilus genes.
TI  - Crossover hot-spot instigator (Chi) sequences in Escherichia coli occupy distinct recombination/transcription islands.
AB  - Crossover hot-spot instigator (Chi) sequences (5'-GCTGGTGG-3') are orientation-dependent, strand-specific sequences implicated in RecA-mediated DNA recombination. In Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae Chi and Chi-like sequences preferentially locate to approx. 1kb recombination 'islands' in the mRNA-synonymous strands of open reading frames (ORFs). Since mRNA-synonymous strands follow Szybalski's transcription direction rule in being G-rich, and the average ORF is about 1kb, then, on this basis alone, Chi sequences are seen to reside in 1kb G-rich 'islands'. However, RecA preferentially binds GT-rich sequences, suggesting that genomic context might potentiate Chi action. Consistent with this, we report for E. coli that 1kb sequence windows with Chi near their centres are a distinct subset of total 1kb windows, the mRNA-synonymous strands being preferentially enriched in both G and T. Chi function might be particularly important for bacteria that survive high temperature and radiation. These often exist in habitats where recombination with E. coli DNA would be unlikely, so canonical Chi sequences might not confer a selective disadvantage in this respect. In general, Chi sequences are not more frequent in thermophilic bacteria and Deinococcus radiodurans, than in E. coli and other mesophilic bacteria. Only two of five thermophilic bacteria examined showed preferential location of Chi sequences to mRNA-synonymous strands. In the thermophile Methanococcus jannaschii, windows containing the canonical Chi sequence do not form a distinct subset. We suggest that in thermophilic bacteria and D. radiodurans the Chi function may be achieved by sequences that differ from the canonical Chi sequence, or that the number of these sequences is sufficient, or that the Chi function is unnecessary.
TI  - Tandem repeats in complete bacterial genome sequences: sequence and structural analyses for comparative studies.
AB  - A series of complete bacterial genome sequences have recently become available and powerful methods have been developed for the identification of tandem repeats on a very large scale. It is thus possible to derive extensive comparative descriptions of such repeats at the level of complete genomes, as illustrated here for three different bacterial genomes: Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Such sequence analyses can be usefully complemented by structural characterisations of the repeats.
TI  - Characteristics of Chi distribution on different bacterial genomes.
AB  - The availability of full genome sequences provides the bases for analyzing global properties of the genetic text. For example, oligonucleotide sequences that are over- or underrepresented can be identified by taking into account the overall genome composition and organization. One of the most overrepresented oligonucleotides in Escherichia coli is the Chi site, an octanucleotide that stimulates DNA repair by homologous recombination. Here we analyze the genomic distribution of Chi in E. coli and in the three other bacteria where a Chi sequence has been identified; note that Chi is a different sequence in each organism. For each bacterial genome, Chi sequences are frequent, regularly distributed, and overrepresented. This suggests that selection for Chi may have occurred during evolution to favor efficient repair of a damaged chromosome. Other characteristics of Chi distribution are not conserved and might reflect specific features of DNA repair in each host. The different sequence and characteristics of Chi in each microorganism suggest that selection for Chi occurred independently in different bacteria.
TI  - Characterization of chimeric lipopolysaccharides from Escherichia coli strain JM109 transformed with lipooligosaccharide synthesis genes (lsg) from Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Previously, we reported the expression of chimeric lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in Escherichia coli strain JM109 (a K-12 strain) transformed with plasmids containing Haemophilus influenzae lipooligosaccharide synthesis genes (lsg) (Abu Kwaik, Y., McLaughlin, R. E., Apicella, M. A., and Spinola, S. M. (1991) Mol. Microbiol. 5, 2475-2480). In this current study, we have analyzed the O-deacylated LPS and free oligosaccharides from three transformants (designated pGEMLOS-4, pGEMLOS-5, and pGEMLOS-7) by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization, electrospray ionization, and tandem mass spectrometry techniques, along with composition and linkage analyses. These data show that the chimeric LPS consist of the complete E. coli LPS core structure glycosylated on the 7-position of the non-reducing terminal branch heptose with oligosaccharides from H. influenzae. In pGEMLOS-7, the disaccharide Gal1--> 3GlcNAc1--> is added, and in pGEMLOS-5, the structure is extended to Gal1-->4GlcNAc1-->3Gal1-->3GlcNAc1-->. PGEMLOS-5 LPS reacts positively with monoclonal antibody 3F11, an antibody that recognizes the terminal disaccharide of lacto-N-neotetraose. In pGEMLOS-4 LPS, the 3F11 epitope is apparently blocked by glycosylation on the 6-position of the terminal Gal with either Gal or GlcNAc. The biosynthesis of these chimeric LPS was found to be dependent on a functional wecA (formerly rfe) gene in E. coli. By using this carbohydrate expression system, we have been able to examine the functions of the lsg genes independent of the effects of other endogenous Haemophilus genes and expressed proteins.
TI  - The influence of ATP on the binding of aromatic amino acids to the ligand response domain of the tyrosine repressor of Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The binding of aromatic amino acids to the ligand response domain of the tyrosine repressor (TyrR) protein (TyrR(lrd)) of Haemophilus influenzae was investigated using circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy. The induced secondary structural changes were unique for each aromatic amino acid and were further influenced by the presence or absence of ATP. Tyrosine was found to have the highest affinity for TyrR(lrd) in the absence of ATP, whereas the affinity for ATP itself increased in the presence of tyrosine. Binding of tyrosine is therefore the conformational trigger for the activation of TyrR whereas ATP is regarded as a conformational co-activator.
TI  - Molecular analysis and identification of the radC gene from the phototrophic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus B10.
AB  - The radC gene, whose product plays a role in the prokaryotic repair of DNA damage after UV and X-ray irradiation, was cloned and sequenced from the phototrophic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus B10. The gene codes for a protein of 214 amino acids with a molecular mass of 23,792 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence showed significant homology with the RadC proteins of Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Haemophilus influenzae. Northern blot analysis indicated that under both chemotrophic and phototrophic growth conditions the radC gene was relatively highly expressed and was induced about five-fold after UV-irradiation. Primer extension analysis revealed that transcription was initiated from the same position before and after UV treatment. Mutants (radC negative) have a low survival rate and a slower growth rate than the wild type.
TI  - The sigma(70) transcription factor TyrR has zinc-stimulated phosphatase activity  that is inhibited by ATP and tyrosine.
AB  - The TyrR protein of Escherichia coli (513 amino acid residues) is the chief transcriptional regulator of a group of genes that are essential for aromatic amino acid biosynthesis and transport. The TyrR protein can function either as a repressor or as an activator. The central region of the TyrR protein (residues 207 to 425) is similar to corresponding polypeptide segments of the NtrC protein superfamily. Like the NtrC protein, TyrR has intrinsic ATPase activity. Here, we report that TyrR possesses phosphatase activity. This activity is subject to inhibition by L-tyrosine and its analogues and by ATP and ATP analogues. Zinc ion (2 mM) stimulated the phosphatase activity of the TyrR protein by a factor of 57. The phosphatase-active site of TyrR was localized to a 31-kDa domain (residues 191 to 467) of the protein. However, mutational alteration of distant amino acid residues at both the N terminus and the C terminus of TyrR altered the phosphatase activity. Haemophilus influenzae TyrR (318 amino acid residues), a protein with a high degree of sequence similarity to the C terminus of the E. coli TyrR protein, exhibited a phosphatase activity similar to that of E. coli TyrR.
TI  - Mannose-binding lectin binds to a range of clinically relevant microorganisms and promotes complement deposition.
AB  - Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a collagenous serum lectin believed to be of importance in innate immunity. Genetically determined low levels of the protein are known to predispose to infections. In this study the binding of purified MBL to pathogens isolated from immunocompromised children was investigated by flow cytometry. Diverse Candida species, Aspergillus fumigatus, Staphylococcus aureus, and beta-hemolytic group A streptococci exhibited strong binding of MBL, whereas Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, and Haemophilus influenzae type b were characterized by heterogeneous binding patterns. In contrast, beta-hemolytic group B streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus epidermidis showed low levels of binding. Bound MBL was able to promote C4 deposition in a concentration-dependent manner. We conclude that MBL may be of importance in first-line immune defense against several important pathogens.
TI  - Bacterial pneumonia.
AB  - Bacterial pneumonia is significantly more common in persons who are HIV-infected  than in the general population and is most common among injection drug users and in persons with advanced HIV disease and immunosuppression. The clinical features of bacterial pneumonia are similar to those in HIV-seronegative persons, but bacteremia is more common. When a pathogen is identified, Streptococcus pneumoniae is consistently the most common, occurring in 20% to 70% of cases. Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and other gram-negative organisms are mainly responsible for the remainder of bacterial pneumonia episodes in the United States, Central Africa, Australia, and England. In some studies, Chlamydia pneumoniae was recognized as a common cause in persons with early HIV disease, whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa is recognized as a community- and hospital-acquired lower respiratory tract pathogen in patients with severe immunosuppression. Although antimicrobial therapy is frequently empiric, it should be tailored to the severity of illness, local prevalence of infections, resistance patterns, or when an etiologic agent is identified. The treatment response is similar in patients with and without HIV infection, but bacterial pneumonia may accelerate the progression of HIV disease. Preventative measures include use of the polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine, especially early in the course of HIV infection, when it is most likely to be effective. The incidence of bacterial pneumonia is also reduced in HIV-seropositive persons who use trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
TI  - The rfaE gene from Escherichia coli encodes a bifunctional protein involved in biosynthesis of the lipopolysaccharide core precursor ADP-L-glycero-D-manno-heptose.
AB  - The intermediate steps in the biosynthesis of the ADP-L-glycero-D-manno-heptose precursor of inner core lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are not yet elucidated. We isolated a mini-Tn10 insertion that confers a heptoseless LPS phenotype in the chromosome of Escherichia coli K-12. The mutation was in a gene homologous to the previously reported rfaE gene from Haemophilus influenzae. The E. coli rfaE gene was cloned into an expression vector, and an in vitro transcription-translation experiment revealed a polypeptide of approximately 55 kDa in mass. Comparisons of the predicted amino acid sequence with other proteins in the database showed the presence of two clearly separate domains. Domain I (amino acids 1 to 318) shared structural features with members of the ribokinase family, while Domain II (amino acids 344 to 477) had conserved features of the cytidylyltransferase superfamily that includes the aut gene product of Ralstonia eutrophus. Each domain was expressed individually, demonstrating that only Domain I could complement the rfaE::Tn10 mutation in E. coli, as well as the rfaE543 mutation of Salmonella enterica SL1102. DNA sequencing of the rfaE543 gene revealed that Domain I had one amino acid substitution and a 12-bp in-frame deletion resulting in the loss of four amino acids, while Domain II remained intact. We also demonstrated that the aut::Tn5 mutation in R. eutrophus is associated with heptoseless LPS, and this phenotype was restored following the introduction of a plasmid expressing the E. coli Domain II. Thus, both domains of rfaE are functionally different and genetically separable confirming that the encoded protein is bifunctional. We propose that Domain I is involved in the synthesis of D-glycero-D-manno-heptose 1-phosphate, whereas Domain II catalyzes the ADP transfer to form ADP-D-glycero-D-manno-heptose.
TI  - Cell division in Escherichia coli: role of FtsL domains in septal localization, function, and oligomerization.
AB  - In Escherichia coli, nine essential cell division proteins are known to localize  to the division septum. FtsL is a 13-kDa bitopic membrane protein with a short cytoplasmic N-terminal domain, a membrane-spanning segment, and a periplasmic domain that has a repeated heptad motif characteristic of leucine zippers. Here, we identify the requirements for FtsL septal localization and function. We used green fluorescent protein fusions to FtsL proteins where domains of FtsL had been exchanged with analogous domains from either its Haemophilus influenzae homologue or the unrelated MalF protein to show that both the membrane-spanning segment and the periplasmic domain of FtsL are required for localization to the division site. Mutagenesis of the periplasmic heptad repeat motif severely impaired both localization and function as well as the ability of FtsL to drive the formation of sodium dodecyl sulfate-resistant multimers in vitro. These results are consistent with the predicted propensity of the FtsL periplasmic domain to adopt a coiled-coiled structure. This coiled-coil motif is conserved in all gram-negative and gram-positive FtsL homologues identified so far. Our data suggest that most of the FtsL molecule is a helical coiled coil involved in FtsL multimerization.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a recombinant Haemophilus influenzae outer membrane phosphomonoesterase e (P4).
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae is a common inhabitant of the upper respiratory tract and  can cause serious infections of mucosal surfaces. Results from recent studies indicate that this pathogen possesses copious amounts of surface-localized phosphomonoesterase activity mediated by the bacterial lipoprotein e (P4). While the enzyme has previously been purified to apparent homogeneity, purification of large amounts of protein has been prevented by presence of N-terminal lipid modification. Recombinant DNA technology was employed to simultaneously replace the N-terminal lipid modification signal sequence with one for protein secretion without such modification and to place expression of the protein under the control of the T7-inducible promoter. Results from this work show that high levels of phosphomonoesterase activity were achieved after IPTG induction and purified to apparent homogeneity after two chromatography steps. Consistent with loss of the N-terminal lipid modification, the recombinant enzyme was easily extracted from the bacterial membrane and partitioned within the matrix of gel filtration chromatography resin while retaining a denatured molecular weight similar to that of wild-type e (P4). Results from physicochemical characterization suggest that the recombinant protein was similar to wild-type protein in SDS-PAGE-derived molecular weight, primary structure, substrate specificity, pH optimum, and sensitivity or resistance to various inhibitors. Acquisition of sufficient amounts of recombinant P4 was a prelude for studies to elucidate the structure and function of this unusual phosphomonoesterase.
TI  - Cloning of the Dam methyltransferase gene from Haemophilus influenzae bacteriophage HP1.
AB  - The putative product of orf13 from the genome of Haemophilus influenzae HP1 bacteriophage shows homology only to bacteriophage T1 Dam methyltransferase, and a weak similarity to the conserved amino acids sequence motifs characteristic of m6A-methyltransferases. Especially interesting is lack of characteristic motif I responsible for binding of S-adenosylmethionine. Despite this fact, a DNA sequence of HP1 bacteriophage of Haemophilus influenzae encoding methyltransferase activity was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli using pMPMT4 omega expression vector. The cloned methyltransferase recognizes the sequence 5'-GATC-3' and methylates an adenine residue. The enzyme methylates both double- and single-stranded DNA substrates.
TI  - Protein interaction maps for complete genomes based on gene fusion events.
AB  - A large-scale effort to measure, detect and analyse protein-protein interactions  using experimental methods is under way. These include biochemistry such as co-immunoprecipitation or crosslinking, molecular biology such as the two-hybrid system or phage display, and genetics such as unlinked noncomplementing mutant detection. Using the two-hybrid system, an international effort to analyse the complete yeast genome is in progress. Evidently, all these approaches are tedious, labour intensive and inaccurate. From a computational perspective, the question is how can we predict that two proteins interact from structure or sequence alone. Here we present a method that identifies gene-fusion events in complete genomes, solely based on sequence comparison. Because there must be selective pressure for certain genes to be fused over the course of evolution, we are able to predict functional associations of proteins. We show that 215 genes or proteins in the complete genomes of Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae and Methanococcus jannaschii are involved in 64 unique fusion events. The approach is general, and can be applied even to genes of unknown function.
TI  - [Monitoring antibiotic resistance in Argentina. The WHONET program, 1995-1996].
AB  - The World Health Organization has implemented a surveillance program for antimicrobial resistance that is known as WHONET. In Argentina the program was developed through a network of 23 public and private hospitals that participate in national and international quality-control programs. Between January 1995 and December 1996, the antimicrobial susceptibility of 16,073 consecutive clinical isolates was determined, using the recommended standards of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards of the United States of America. More than half of the Escherichia coli urinary isolates were resistant to ampicillin and more than 30% to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT). When the percentage of resistant isolates from outpatients (OPs) was compared to that observed in hospitalized patients (HPs), a marked difference in antimicrobial activity was noted in the case of gentamicin (2% from OPs resistant vs. 8% from HPs resistant), norfloxacin (2% vs. 6%), and third-generation cephalosporins (7% vs. 15%). Of the Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates recovered from blood cultures, 71% and 60% showed resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and to gentamicin, respectively. The overall rate of oxacillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus was 39%. Around half of the Enterococcus spp. isolates showed high resistance to aminoglycosides, but resistance to glycopeptides was not found. In Argentina, ampicillin and SXT were not suitable for treating diarrhea. Shigella flexneri had a higher number of isolates resistant to both of those drugs (87% and 74%, respectively) than Sh. sonnei did (47% and 71%, respectively). About 40% of the Salmonella spp. isolated in pediatric hospitals were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins. When microorganisms causing bacterial meningitis were examined, Streptococcus pneumoniae showed a resistance rate of 18% to penicillin and Haemophilus influenzae a resistance rate of 19% to ampicillin. These rates are within the intermediate range reported for other countries of the Americas and for Europe.
TI  - Conservation of a tRNA core for aminoacylation.
AB  - The core region of Escherichia coli tRNA(Cys)is important for aminoacylation of the tRNA. This core contains an unusual G15:G48 base pair, and three adenosine nucleotides A13, A22 and A46 that are likely to form a 46:[13:22] adenosine base triple. We recently observed that the 15:48 base pair and the proposed 46:[13:22] triple are structurally and functionally coupled to contribute to aminoacylation. Inspection of a database of tRNA sequences shows that these elements are only found in one other tRNA, the Haemophilus influenzae tRNA(Cys). Because of the complexity of the core, conservation of sequence does not mean conservation of function. We here tested whether the conserved elements in H. influenzae tRNA(Cys)were also important for aminoacylation of H. influenzae tRNA(Cys). We cloned and purified a recombinant H. influenzae cysteine-tRNA synthe-tase and showed that it depends on 15:48 and 13, 22 and 46 in a relationship analogous to that of E. coli cysteine-tRNA synthetase. The functional conservation of the tRNA core is correlated with sequence conservation between E.coli and H.influenzae cysteine-tRNA synthetases. As the genome of H. influenzae is one of the smallest and may approximate a small autonomous entity in the development of life, the dependence of this genome on G15:G48 and its coupling with the proposed A46:[A13:A22] triple for aminoacylation with cysteine suggests an early role of these motifs in the evolution of decoding genetic information.
TI  - Direct selection of IS903 transposon insertions by use of a broad-host-range vector: isolation of catalase-deficient mutants of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Transposon mutagenesis in bacteria generally requires efficient delivery of a transposon suicide vector to allow the selection of relatively infrequent transposition events. We have developed an IS903-based transposon mutagenesis system for diverse gram-negative bacteria that is not limited by transfer efficiency. The transposon, IS903phikan, carries a cryptic kan gene, which can be expressed only after successful transposition. This allows the stable introduction of the transposon delivery vector into the host. Generation of insertion mutants is then limited only by the frequency of transposition. IS903phikan was placed on an IncQ plasmid vector with the transposase gene located outside the transposon and expressed from isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible promoters. After transposase induction, IS903phikan insertion mutants were readily selected in Escherichia coli by their resistance to kanamycin. We used IS903phikan to isolate three catalase-deficient mutants of the periodontal pathogen Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans from a library of random insertions. The mutants display increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, and all have IS903phikan insertions within an open reading frame whose predicted product is closely related to other bacterial catalases. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the catalase gene (designated katA) and flanking intergenic regions also revealed several occurrences of an 11-bp sequence that is closely related to the core DNA uptake signal sequence for natural transformation of Haemophilus influenzae. Our results demonstrate the utility of the IS903phikan mutagenesis system for the study of A. actinomycetemcomitans. Because IS903phikan is carried on a mobilizable, broad-host-range IncQ plasmid, this system is potentially useful in a variety of bacterial species.
TI  - The role of recombination and mutation in 16S-23S rDNA spacer rearrangements.
AB  - The intragenomic heterogeneity of the bacterial intergenic (16S-23S rDNA) spacer  region (ISR) was analysed from the following species in which sequences for the complete rRNA operon (rrn) set have been determined (rrn number): Enterococcus faecalis (6) and E. faecium (6), Bacillus subtilis (10), Staphylococcus aureus (9), Vibrio cholerae (4), Haemophilus influenzae (6) and Escherichia coli (7). It was found that some spacer sequence blocks were highly conserved between operons of a genome, whereas the presence of others was variable. When these variations were analysed using the program PLATO and partial likelihood phylogenies determined by DNAml for each operon set, three regions showed significant (Z>3.3) spatial variation [Region I was 78-184 nt long (2.1<Z<49.4), Region II was 10-60 nt long (3.7<Z<23)] and Region III was 6 nt long (3.4<Z>4.4) possibly due to recombination or selection. Within Region I, there was sequence block variation in all operon sets [some operons contained tRNA genes (tRNAala, tRNAile or tRNAglu), whereas others had sequence blocks such as VS2 (S. aureus) or rsl (E. coli)]. Q Analysis of the ISR sequence from E. faecalis and E. faecium showed that there was more interspecies than intraspecies variation (both in DNA sequence and in the presence or absence of blocks). Dot matrix analysis of the sequence blocks in the nine rrn ISRs from S. aureus showed that there was significant homology between VS2 and VS5/VS6. Furthermore, repeat motifs with only A or T were present in higher copy numbers in VS5/VS6 than in VS2. Since these sequence blocks (VS2 and VS5-VS6) are related, intragenic evolution resulting in AT expansion may have occurred between these two regions. A model is proposed that postulates a role for recombination and AT-expansion in intra-genomic ISR variations. This process may represent a general mechanism of concerted evolution for bacterial ISR rearrangements.
TI  - Studies of codon usage and tRNA genes of 18 unicellular organisms and quantification of Bacillus subtilis tRNAs: gene expression level and species-specific diversity of codon usage based on multivariate analysis.
AB  - We examined codon usage in Bacillus subtilis genes by multivariate analysis, quantified its cellular levels of individual tRNAs, and found a clear constraint of tRNA contents on synonymous codon choice. Individual tRNA levels were proportional to the copy number of the respective tRNA genes. This indicates that the tRNA gene copy number is an important factor to determine in cellular tRNA levels, which is common with Escherichia coli and yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Codon usage in 18 unicellular organisms whose genomes have been sequenced completely was analyzed and compared with the composition of tRNA genes. The 18 organisms are as follows: yeast S. cerevisiae, Aquifex aeolicus, Archaeoglobus fulgidus, B. subtilis, Borrelia burgdorferi, Chlamydia trachomatis, E. coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacterpylori, Methanococcusjannaschii, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Pyrococcus horikoshii, Rickettsia prowazekii, Synechocystis sp., and Treponema pallidum. Codons preferred in highly expressed genes were related to the codons optimal for the translation process, which were predicted by the composition of isoaccepting tRNA genes. Genes with specific codon usage are discussed in connection with their evolutionary origins and functions. The origin and terminus of replication could be predicted on the basis of codon usage when the usage was analyzed relative to the transcription direction of individual genes.
TI  - [Neurosurgical complications of purulent meningitis in the tropical zone].
AB  - Our retrospective study concerned 35 cases of surgical complications related to bacterial meningitis in 16 adults and 19 children. The mean age was 28 years for adults (15-56 years), and 6 months for children (1-12 months). Portal of entry for meningitis was found in 12 cases (35%): 8 sinusitis and 4 otitis. Delay to appearance of complications was 4.5 days, and to diagnosis confirmation 9 days with CT scan (17 cases), and transfontanellar ultrasonography (19 cases). The complications were: hydrocephalus, 19 cases (54%), brain empyemas, 7 cases (20%), abscesses, 10 cases (28.5%), ventriculitis, 2 cases (6%). Twenty-two bacteria were isolated from the CSF: Streptococcus pneumoniae (15 cases), Haemophilus influenzae (5 cases), Neisseria meningitidis (1 case), and Escherichia coli (1 case). Fourteen patients underwent neurosurgical treatment based on aspiration in case of suppuration and external drainage in case of hydrocephalus. The associated medical treatment was antibiotics combining third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolone, and metronidazol, with a mean duration of 12 days. Recovery rate was 89%, letality 11%, and after effect rate were 33%. Our results confirm the low frequency of neurosurgical complications related to bacterial meningitis, but it emphasizes the role of an early CT-scan for diagnosis and prognosis.
TI  - Extended X-ray absorption fine structure studies on periplasmic and intracellular molybdenum-binding proteins.
AB  - We have studied the molybdenum K-edge X-ray absorption spectra of Mo bound in the Mo-binding proteins Mop from Haemophilus influenzae, ModG from Azotobacter vinelandii and the Escherichia coli ModE transcriptional regulatory protein, and compared them with the absorption spectra of A. vinelandii ModA and monomeric molybdate. Pre-edge and extended fine structure data indicate that the Mo-binding proteins with molbindin-like domains bind tetrahedral molybdate with a Mo-O distance of 1.76 A. The molbindin subunits or sub-domains represent a novel protein fold that is used by proteins with distinct functions to bind molybdate in the cytoplasm. The high specificity of the proteins for molybdenum does not depend on a change of coordination number or geometry.
TI  - Studies on the ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase subfamily of the nudix hydrolases and tentative identification of trgB, a gene associated with tellurite resistance.
AB  - Four Nudix hydrolase genes, ysa1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, orf209 from Escherichia coli, yqkg from Bacillus subtilis, and hi0398 from Hemophilus influenzae were amplified, cloned into an expression vector, and transformed into E. coli. The expressed proteins were purified and shown to belong to a subfamily of Nudix hydrolases active on ADP-ribose. Comparison with other members of the subfamily revealed a conserved proline 16 amino acid residues downstream of the Nudix box, common to all of the ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase subfamily. In this same region, a conserved tyrosine designates another subfamily, the diadenosine polyphosphate pyrophosphatases, while an array of eight conserved amino acids is indicative of the NADH pyrophosphatases. On the basis of these classifications, the trgB gene, a tellurite resistance factor from Rhodobacter sphaeroides, was predicted to designate an ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase. In support of this hypothesis, a highly specific ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase gene from the archaebacterium, Methanococcus jannaschii, introduced into E. coli, increased the transformant's tolerance to potassium tellurite.
TI  - Outer membrane lipoprotein e (P4) of Haemophilus influenzae is a novel phosphomonoesterase.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae exists as a commensal of the upper respiratory tract of humans but also causes infections of contiguous structures. We describe the identification, localization, purification, and characterization of a novel, surface-localized phosphomonoesterase from a nontypeable H. influenzae strain, R2866. Sequences obtained from two CNBr-derived fragments of this protein matched lipoprotein e (P4) within the H. influenzae sequence database. Escherichia coli DH5alpha transformed with plasmids containing the H. influenzae hel gene, which encodes lipoprotein e (P4), produced high levels of a membrane-associated phosphomonoesterase. The isolated approximately 28-kDa enzyme was tartrate resistant and displayed narrow substrate specificity with the highest activity for arylphosphates, excluding 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate. Optimum enzymatic activity was observed at pH 5.0 and only in the presence of divalent copper. The enzyme was inhibited by vanadate, molybdate, and EDTA but was resistant to inorganic phosphate. The association of phosphomonoesterase activity with a protein that has also been recognized as a heme transporter suggests a unique role for this unusual phosphohydrolase.
TI  - [Computer analysis of regulatory signals in complete bacterial genomes. Translation initiation of ribosomal protein operons].
AB  - Signals of translation initiation of operons of Haemophilus influenzae ribosomal  proteins were predicted. This process is regulated by the formation of secondary RNA structures to which one of the proteins encoded in a particular operon binds. In some cases, these structures imitate the region of protein binding to rRNA. Predictions are made by comparing with homologous operons of Escherichia coli and analogous regions of rRNA and by estimating the energy of secondary structure formation. It is shown that this regulatory mechanism occurs: in operons L11, S10, S15, spc, and alpha of H.influenzae and, probably, in operon S15 of Helicobacter pylori, Bacillus subtilis, and Mycoplasma genitalium.
TI  - Long W tracts are over-represented in the Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae genomes.
AB  - The occurrence of DNA tracts of the three binary base combinations: R.Y, K.M and  W;S has been mapped in the complete genomes of Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli. A highly significant over-representation of W tracts is observed in both bacteria. The excess of W tracts is particularly striking in the 10% intercoding regions. Subdivision of intercoding regions into divergent (promoting), convergent (terminating) and sequential subregions shows that the excess of W tracts is most concentrated in the promoter regions. A particularly high excess of W tracts is observed in the first 200 bases 5' upstream of coding start sites. The data suggest that W tracts have a role in promoter function. A function as unwinding centers, analogous to the role of R.Y tracts in eukaryotes, is proposed. R.Y and K.M tracts are only modestly over-represented in the two bacteria.
TI  - A Haemophilus influenzae gene that encodes a membrane bound 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) kinase. Possible involvement of kdo phosphorylation in bacterial virulence.
AB  - The lipopolysaccharide of Haemophilus influenzae contains a single 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) residue derivatized with either a phosphate or an ethanolamine pyrophosphate moiety at the 4-OH position. In previous studies, we identified a kinase unique to H. influenzae extracts that phosphorylates Kdo-lipid IV(A), a key precursor of lipopolysaccharide in this organism. We have now identified the gene encoding the Kdo kinase by using an expression cloning approach. A cosmid library containing random DNA fragments from H. influenzae strain Rd was constructed in Escherichia coli. Extracts of 472 colonies containing individual hybrid cosmids were assayed for Kdo kinase activity. A single hybrid cosmid directing expression of the kinase was found. The kinase gene was identified by activity assays, sub-cloning, and DNA sequencing. When the putative kinase gene was expressed in E. coli behind a T7 promoter, massive overproduction of kinase activity was achieved ( approximately 8000-fold higher than in H. influenzae membranes). The catalytic properties and the product generated by the overexpressed kinase, assayed with Kdo-lipid IV(A) as the substrate, were the same as observed with H. influenzae membranes. Unexpectedly, the kinase gene was identical to a previously characterized open reading frame (orfZ), which had been shown to be important for establishing bacteremia in an infant rat model (Hood, D. W., Deadman, M. E., Allen, T., Masoud, H., Martin, A., Brisson, J. R., Fleischmann, R., Venter, J. C., Richards, J. C., and Moxon, E. R. (1996) Mol. Microbiol. 22, 951-965). However, based solely on the genome sequence of H. influenzae Rd, no biochemical function had been assigned to the product of orfZ, which we now designate kdkA ("Kdo kinase A"). Although Kdo phosphorylation may be critical for bacterial virulence of H. influenzae, it does not appear to be required for growth.
TI  - Identification of genes coding for exported proteins of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Random fusions of genomic DNA fragments to a partial gene encoding a signal sequence-deficient bacterial alkaline phosphatase were utilized to screen for exported proteins of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in Escherichia coli. Twenty-four PhoA(+) clones were isolated and sequenced. Membrane localization signals in the form of signal sequences were deduced from most of these sequences. Several of the deduced amino acid sequences were found to be homologous to known exported or membrane-associated proteins. The complete genes corresponding to two of these sequences were isolated from an A. actinomycetemcomitans lambda phage library. One gene was found to be homologous to the outer membrane lipoprotein LolB. The second gene product had homology with a Haemophilus influenzae protein and was localized to the inner membrane of A. actinomycetemcomitans.
TI  - Bacterial and viral etiology of serious infections in very young Filipino infants.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pneumonia, meningitis and other serious infections are leading causes  of death in developing countries. As part of a multicenter study we aimed to determine the etiology of pneumonia, meningitis and other serious infections in a cohort of Filipino infants ages 90 days or younger. METHOD: During a 2-year period, 2053 infants age 90 days or younger presenting to 1 of 3 Manila community hospitals were screened; 873 had signs or symptoms suggestive of an infectious illness, and 608 were judged to have clinical features suggestive of severe infection and had laboratory workup including blood for culture and white blood cell count, nasopharyngeal aspirate for virology, cerebrospinal fluid culture when indicated and chest radiograph. Chest radiographs were read independently by 3 radiologists without knowledge of clinical findings. RESULTS: Of the 873 enrolled infants, 81 died (91%). After exclusion of presumed contaminants, positive bacterial culture from blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid was obtained in 35 infants (5.8%; 95% confidence interval 4%, 8%), 9 of whom died. The organisms responsible for meningitis were Acinetobacter spp. (4), Streptococcus pneumoniae (2), Escherichia coli (2), Enterobacter spp. (1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), Haemophilus influenzae (1) and Staphylococcus aureus (1); those responsible for the other clinical diagnoses were Salmonella spp. (6), Enterobacter spp. (3), Streptococcus pyogenes (3), other Gram-negative organisms (8), S. pneumoniae (1) and Staphylococcus aureus (2). In 685 infants examined for viral causes of their illness, 223 viruses were isolated from 219 infants (32%; 95% confidence interval 28%, 36%). Enteroviruses were the most common potential pathogens identified (22% of infants studied), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (17%), rhinovirus (10%) and adenovirus (4%). Concomitant virus identification occurred in 10 of those with positive bacterial culture (29%; 95% confidence interval, 15%, 46%), with enterovirus being found in 7 of these cases. CONCLUSION: Many young Filipino infants with life-threatening illness were evaluated in this study. Thirty-five had infections attributable to bacteria, with Salmonella spp. being the most common, followed by Gram-negative organisms. Pneumococcus was an unusual cause.
TI  - Etiology of serious infections in young Gambian infants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite improvements in infant mortality rates in many developing countries including The Gambia, neonatal mortality remains high and many neonatal deaths are caused by infection. The study described in this paper was conducted to determine the bacterial and viral etiology of serious infections in Gambian infants younger than 91 days old. METHODS: At a first level health facility 497 infants with symptoms that could indicate serious infection were enrolled, of whom 239 with 1 or more signs of serious infection and 55 with no signs were investigated, yielding 17 cases with positive bacterial cultures of blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid. At a nearby pediatric referral hospital 198 infants were seen and 182 were investigated, yielding 35 positive bacterial cultures. RESULTS: There were 15 culture positive cases of meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (7), Streptococcus pyogenes (2), Enterobacter cloacae (2), Escherichia coli (1), Haemophilus influenzae type b (1), Streptococcus agalactiae (1) and Salmonella spp. (1). Six of these children died. Thirty-three infants without meningitis had positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus aureus (17), S. pneumoniae (3), Salmonella spp. (5), E. coli (3), other enterobacteria (4) and S. agalactiae (1), of whom 14 died. Nasopharyngeal aspirates from 438 children were investigated for common respiratory viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus was found in 51, influenza A in 46, influenza B in 22, parainfluenza in 26 and adenovirus in 16. Respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A isolates were found most frequently toward the end of the wet season. Nasopharyngeal carriage of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae was studied in 320 infants recruited during the first year. Of these 184 (58%) were positive for S. pneumoniae and 141 (44%) were positive for H. influenzae, 18 of which were type b. Infants with a bacterial isolate from blood or cerebrospinal fluid were more likely than the rest to die, whereas those with a viral isolate were less likely to die. CONCLUSIONS: The most important causes of serious infections in young Gambian infants are Staphylococcus aureus, S. pneumoniae and Salmonella spp.
TI  - An extremely thermostable aldolase from Sulfolobus solfataricus with specificity  for non-phosphorylated substrates.
AB  - Sulfolobus solfataricus is a hyperthermophilic archaeon growing optimally at 80-85 degrees C. It metabolizes glucose via a novel non-phosphorylated Entner-Doudoroff pathway, in which the reversible C(6) to C(3) aldol cleavage is catalysed by 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate aldolase (KDG-aldolase), generating pyruvate and glyceraldehyde. Given the ability of such a hyperstable enzyme to catalyse carbon-carbon-bond synthesis with non-phosphorylated metabolites, we report here the cloning and sequencing of the S. solfataricus gene encoding KDG-aldolase, and its expression in Escherichia coli to give fully active enzyme. The recombinant enzyme was purified in a simple two-step procedure, and shown to possess kinetic properties indistinguishable from the enzyme purified from S. solfataricus cells. The KDG-aldolase is a thermostable tetrameric protein with a half-life at 100 degrees C of 2.5 h, and is equally active with both d- and l-glyceraldehyde. It exhibits sequence similarity to the N-acetylneuraminate lyase superfamily of Schiff-base-dependent aldolases, dehydratases and decarboxylases, and evidence is presented for a similar catalytic mechanism for the archaeal enzyme by substrate-dependent inactivation by reduction with NaBH(4).
TI  - The dcuD (former yhcL) gene product of escherichia coli as a member of the DcuC family of C4-dicarboxylate carriers: lack of evident expression
AB  - The dcuD gene (formerly yhcL) of Escherichia coli shows significant sequence similarity only to the dcuC gene of E. coli, which encodes a C4-dicarboxylate carrier (DcuC) that functions during anaerobic growth. Inactivation of dcuD had no effect on the growth of E. coli under a large number of conditions and led to no detectable changes in phenotype. Translational dcuD'-'lacZ gene fusions were not significantly expressed in the presence of dicarboxylates or monocarboxylates under oxic or anoxic conditions. Other potential substrates such as amino sugar derivatives, amino acids, and alpha-aspartyl dipeptides also did not lead to expression of dcuD. Changes in medium composition, pH, ionic strength, and temperature had no significant effects on dcuD expression. A dcuD gene amplified from a natural isolate of E. coli was not expressed in wild-type and E. coli K-12 backgrounds. Cloning of dcuD behind an inducible promoter resulted in the synthesis of a protein of the expected size (49 kDa), which, however, did not complement for the loss of DcuC or other C4-dicarboxylate carriers. It is suggested that dcuD encodes a protein of the DcuC family of anaerobic C4-dicarboxylate carriers and that dcuD is not significantly expressed or is expressed only under conditions not related to carboxylate metabolism. When two adjacent open reading frames (y0585 and y0586) from Haemophilus influenzae are fused, the resulting hypothetical protein has sequence similarity to DcuC and DcuD.
TI  - Sequence analysis of the Rhizobium etli ribose kinase gene rbsK and its phylogenetic position.
AB  - DNA sequence analysis of a 1878-bp DNA fragment located downstream from the Rhizobium etli ptsN gene revealed the presence of an open reading frame coding for a protein of 300 amino acids. This protein is homologous to members of the PfkB subfamily of carbohydrate and carbohydrate phosphate kinases. Since the highest homology is observed with the ribokinases of Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae and Bacillus subtilis, the isolated gene was named the R. etli rbsK gene. The eubacterial ribokinases form a cluster distinct from the cluster of ribokinase proteins of the archaebacteria Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, Methanococcus jannaschii and Sulfolobus solfoataricus, which form a more divergent group of proteins. R. etli RbsK has a molecular mass of 30.6 kDa and a calculated isoelectric point of 4.5. No homologues of Escherichia coli ORF284 and ORF90 were found downstream from R. etli ptsN.
TI  - In vitro characterization of peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (PAL)-peptidoglycan and PAL-TolB interactions.
AB  - The Tol-peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (PAL) system of Escherichia coli is  a multiprotein complex of the envelope involved in maintaining outer membrane integrity. PAL and the periplasmic protein TolB, two components of this complex, are interacting with each other, and they have also been reported to interact with OmpA and the major lipoprotein, two proteins interacting with the peptidoglycan. All these interactions suggest a role of the Tol-PAL system in anchoring the outer membrane to the peptidoglycan. Therefore, we were interested in better understanding the interaction between PAL and the peptidoglycan. We designed an in vitro interaction assay based on the property of purified peptidoglycan to be pelleted by ultracentrifugation. Using this assay, we showed that a purified PAL protein interacted in vitro with pure peptidoglycan. A peptide competition experiment further demonstrated that the region from residues 89 to 130 of PAL was sufficient to bind the peptidoglycan. Moreover, the fact that this same region of PAL was also binding to TolB suggested that these two interactions were exclusive. Indeed, the TolB-PAL complex appeared not to be associated with the peptidoglycan. This led us to the conclusion that PAL may exist in two forms in the cell envelope, one bound to TolB and the other bound to the peptidoglycan.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of FK041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The therapeutic activities of orally administered FK041 were evaluated in mouse models of systemic and local infections with a variety of bacteria and were compared with those of cefdinir (CFDN) and cefditoren pivoxil (CDTR-PI). FK041 exhibited potent therapeutic activity against lethal systemic infections induced by intraperitoneally inoculated Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae with 50% effective doses (ED50) in the range of 0.20 to 0.36 mg/kg and was more active than CFDN and CDTR-PI. This result correlated well with its in vitro activity. The therapeutic effects of FK041 and reference drugs on murine local infections were evaluated in an in vivo pharmacokinetic model simulating human plasma concentrations for oral administration of 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg. Against murine subcutaneous abscess induced by S. aureus, FK041 was as effective as CFDN and significantly more effective than CDTR-PI in reducing the number of recoverable viable bacteria in the skin at the infection sites. The efficacy of FK041 against murine pneumonia with H. influenzae was comparable to that of CDTR-PI and was superior to that of CFDN in reducing viable bacteria activity in the lungs. These results strongly suggest that FK041 has potential for clinical use against various bacterial infections.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (CFDN) and cefditoren (CDTR). FK041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK041 was active against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms except Enterococcus faecalis with MIC90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. FK041 was more active than CFDN and CDTR against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to CFDN and CDTR against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. FK041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae with an MIC range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to CFDN but inferior to CDTR. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, FK041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of CFDN and CDTR. However, it was inferior to CDTR in activity against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Morganella morganii, and Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With FK041 a small difference between MIC and MBC against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. FK041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. The stability of FK041 to these enzymes was similar to those of CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of S. aureus (PBP 3, 2, and 1) and E. coli (PBP 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of L4-mediated autogenous control of the S10 ribosomal protein operon.
AB  - We investigated the regulation of the S10 ribosomal protein (r-protein) operon among members of the gamma subdivision of the proteobacteria, which includes Escherichia coli. In E. coli, this 11-gene operon is autogenously controlled by r-protein L4. This regulation requires specific determinants within the untranslated leader of the mRNA. Secondary structure analysis of the S10 leaders of five enterobacteria (Salmonella typhimurium, Citrobacter freundii, Yersinia enterocolitica, Serratia marcescens, and Morganella morganii) and two nonenteric members of the gamma subdivision (Haemophilus influenzae and Vibrio cholerae) shows that these foreign leaders share significant structural homology with the E. coli leader, particularly in the region which is critical for L4-mediated autogenous control in E. coli. Moreover, these heterologous leaders produce a regulatory response to L4 oversynthesis in E. coli. Our results suggest that an E. coli-like L4-mediated regulatory mechanism may operate in all of these species. However, the mechanism is not universally conserved among the gamma subdivision members, since at least one, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, does not contain the required S10 leader features, and its leader cannot provide the signals for regulation by L4 in E. coli. We speculate that L4-mediated autogenous control developed during the evolution of the gamma branch of proteobacteria.
TI  - Identification of the znuA-encoded periplasmic zinc transport protein of Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - The znuA gene of Haemophilus ducreyi encodes a 32-kDa (mature) protein that has homology to both the ZnuA protein of Escherichia coli and the Pzp1 protein of H. influenzae; both of these latter proteins are members of a growing family of prokaryotic zinc transporters. Inactivation of the H. ducreyi 35000 znuA gene by insertional mutagenesis resulted in a mutant that grew more slowly than the wild-type parent strain in vitro unless ZnCl(2) was provided at a final concentration of 100 microM. Other cations tested did not restore growth of this H. ducreyi mutant to wild-type levels. The H. ducreyi ZnuA protein was localized to the periplasm, where it is believed to function as the binding component of a zinc transport system. Complementation of the znuA mutation with the wild-type H. ducreyi znuA gene provided in trans restored the ability of this H. ducreyi mutant to grow normally in the absence of exogenously added ZnCl2. The wild-type H. ducreyi znuA gene was also able to complement a H. influenzae pzp1 mutation. The H. ducreyi znuA isogenic mutant exhibited significantly decreased virulence (P = 0.0001) when tested in the temperature-dependent rabbit model for experimental chancroid. This decreased virulence was not observed when the znuA mutant was complemented with the wild-type H. ducreyi znuA gene provided in trans.
TI  - Fifteen years of experience with bacterial meningitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Introduction of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccines has dramatically altered the epidemiology of bacterial meningitis in children. The goal of this study was to describe these changes in a pediatric teaching hospital. METHODS: Patient charts at Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center, Seattle, were identified by diagnosis codes and reviewed retrospectively. The 1981 to 1995 time period was chosen to incorporate three distinct 5-year periods: before the use of unconjugated Hib vaccine; between the unconjugated and conjugate vaccines; and after the conjugate vaccines were available for routine immunization of infants. RESULTS: Bacterial meningitis was identified in 806 cases. In 13 premature infant cases Escherichia coli was most frequently isolated (6 cases). Group B Streptococcus, E. coli and Listeria monocytogenes were the most common pathogens in 87 neonatal cases. The most common pathogens in 706 cases of childhood meningitis were H. influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. H. influenzae was the most common pathogen in the first two time periods (73 and 69% of childhood cases, respectively), but not so in the third period (16%). CONCLUSIONS: A changing pattern in childhood meningitis was observed during the study period. H. influenzae cases dramatically declined, altering the relative proportions of other pathogens, S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis. However, the number of cases caused by these latter pathogens remained steady.
TI  - Analysis of base-pairing potentials between 16S rRNA and 5' UTR for translation initiation in various prokaryotes.
AB  - MOTIVATION: It is well accepted that the 3' end of 16S rRNA is directly involved  in prokaryotic translation initiation by pairing with the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence, which is located in the ribosome-binding site of mRNA. According to Shine and Dalgarno, Escherichia coli 's 5' UTR has the pattern of 'AGGAGG' (SD sequence), which is complementary to the 3' end sequence of 16S rRNA. In this work, we systematically calculated free-energy values of the base pairing between the 3' end of 16S rRNA and the 5' UTR of mRNA, in order to analyze the base-pairing potentials in various prokaryotes. The free-energy values were then plotted over distances from the start codon to visualize the free-energy pattern of 5'UTRs. RESULTS: The average free-energy values fell sharply before the start codon in E. coli, which is consistent with the model that the 3' end of 16S rRNA base pairs with the SD sequence. Haemophilus influenzae, Bacillus subtilis and Helicobacter pylori show a similar pattern, suggesting that the organisms have basically the same mechanism of translation initiation as E. coli. Other eubacteria, such as Synechocystis PCC6803, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Borrelia burgdorferi also show decreases in their free-energy values, although they are less evident. We also did the same analysis with a eukaryote genome as a control; no fall in free-energy values was observed between the 3' end of 18S rRNA and 5' UTRs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting that this organism does not base pair in translation initiation. The three archaebacteria A. fulgidus, M. jannaschii and M. thermoautotrophicum show patterns similar to eubacteria, but not to S. cerevisiae, indicating that archaebacteria are closer to eubacteria than to eukaryotes with respect to the mechanism of translation initiation. From these observations, it appears that the shape of the curve produced by the algorithm can be used to predict the mechanism of translation initiation. AVAILABILITY: The C programs used in our analysis are available upon request.
TI  - HP0333, a member of the dprA family, is involved in natural transformation in Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - Helicobacter pylori is naturally competent for DNA transformation, but the mechanism by which transformation occurs is not known. For Haemophilus influenzae, dprA is required for transformation by chromosomal but not plasmid DNA, and the complete genomic sequence of H. pylori 26695 revealed a dprA homolog (HP0333). Examination of genetic databases indicates that DprA homologs are present in a wide variety of bacterial species. To examine whether HP0333 has a function similar to dprA of H. influenzae, HP0333, present in each of 11 strains studied, was disrupted in two H. pylori isolates. For both mutants, the frequency of transformation by H. pylori chromosomal DNA was markedly reduced, but not eliminated, compared to their wild-type parental strains. Mutation of HP0333 also resulted in a marked decrease in transformation frequency by a shuttle plasmid (pHP1), which differs from the phenotype described in H. influenzae. Complementation of the mutant with HP0333 inserted in trans in the chromosomal ureAB locus completely restored the frequency of transformation to that of the wild-type strain. Thus, while dprA is required for high-frequency transformation, transformation also may occur independently of DprA. The presence of DprA homologs in bacteria known not to be naturally competent suggests a broad function in DNA processing.
TI  - [In vitro bactericidal activities of new oral penem, faropenem against the various clinical isolates].
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of faropenem (FRPM) more compared with those of various oral beta-lactams against 15 isolates each of 6 species of microorganism. FRPM possessed potent in vitro antibacterial activity against both aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria tested. FRPM showed the same activity as new oral cephems such as cefdinir, cefditoren and cefcapene against all Gram-negative bacteria, but K. pneumoniae strains were less susceptible. The MBC of FRPM against S. pneumoniae and the other strains tested equal and were within 1 dilution the MIC of that, respectively. These results suggest that FRPM has excellent in vitro bactericidal activity against clinical isolates and is a clinically useful for the chemotherapy of bacterial infections.
TI  - Models of experimental bacterial meningitis. Role and limitations.
AB  - The seriousness of bacterial meningitis has encouraged the development of animal  models that characterize complex pathogenetic and pathophysiologic mechanisms, provide evaluation of pharmacokinetic and antimicrobial effects of antibiotics (especially since the worldwide emergence of multiresistant bacteria), and establish new adjuvant treatment strategies (e.g., use of anti-inflammatory agents). The information obtained from an animal model depends on the site of inoculation. For example, using intranasal, intravenous, subcutaneous, or intraperitoneal inoculation, it is the bacterial and host factors that determine the development of bacteremia and the potential for a pathogen to invade the central nervous system that primarily are studied. In contrast, experimental models using direct inoculation into the cerebrospinal fluid can reliably produce lethal infections over a predictable time course. Furthermore, because adult animals will not reliably develop meningitis after intranasal or intraperitoneal challenge, infant animals are used. Because these models bypass the natural dissemination of bacteria from the intravascular compartment to the central nervous system, the pathogenesis is artificial. These models, however, are extremely useful for the study of pathogen and host factors leading to meningeal inflammation and resulting complications, and for evaluating potentially useful agents for treatment therapy. During the past decade, the design of clinical studies has been stimulated by findings obtained from these animal models.
TI  - Comparison of the D-glutamate-adding enzymes from selected gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The biochemical properties of the D-glutamate-adding enzymes (MurD) from Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus were investigated to detect any differences in the activity of this enzyme between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The genes (murD) that encode these enzymes were cloned into pMAL-c2 fusion vector and overexpressed as maltose-binding protein-MurD fusion proteins. Each fusion protein was purified to homogeneity by affinity to amylose resin. Proteolytic treatments of the fusion proteins with factor Xa regenerated the individual MurD proteins. It was found that these fusion proteins retain D-glutamate-adding activity and have Km and Vmax values similar to those of the regenerated MurDs, except for the H. influenzae enzyme. Substrate inhibition by UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanine, the acceptor substrate, was observed at concentrations greater than 15 and 30 microM for E. coli and H. influenzae MurD, respectively. Such substrate inhibition was not observed with the E. faecalis and S. aureus enzymes, up to a substrate concentration of 1 to 2 mM. In addition, the two MurDs of gram-negative origin were shown to require monocations such as NH4+ and/or K+, but not Na+, for optimal activity, while anions such as Cl- and SO4(2-) had no effect on the enzyme activities. The activities of the two MurDs of gram-positive origin, on the other hand, were not affected by any of the ions tested. All four enzymes required Mg2+ for the ligase activity and exhibited optimal activities around pH 8. These differences observed between the gram-positive and gram-negative MurDs indicated that the two gram-negative bacteria may apply a more stringent regulation of cell wall biosynthesis at the early stage of peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathway than do the two gram-positive bacteria. Therefore, the MurD-catalyzed reaction may constitute a fine-tuning step necessary for the gram-negative bacteria to optimally maintain its relatively thin yet essential cell wall structure during all stages of growth.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of LJC 11,036, an active metabolite of L-084, a new oral carbapenem antibiotic with potent antipneumococcal activity.
AB  - LJC 11,036 is the active metabolite of L-084, a novel oral carbapenem that exhibits potent broad-spectrum activity. Antibacterial activities of LJC 11,036 against clinical isolates from respiratory infections, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 52), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 19), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 50), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 53), and Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 53), and from urinary-tract infections, such as Escherichia coli (n = 53) (MICs at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited [MIC(90)s], 0.1, </=0.006, 0.39, 0.05, 0.05, and 0.05 microg/ml, respectively), were 2- to 64-fold higher than those of imipenem, cefdinir, and faropenem. Moreover, against these bacterial species, except for H. influenzae, the MIC(90)s of LJC 11,036 were 4- to 512-fold lower than those of levofloxacin. LJC 11,036 showed bactericidal activity equal or superior to that of imipenem. Bactericidal activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) did not vary with the phase of growth. LJC 11,036 had potent activity against various beta-lactamase-producing strains, excluding carbapenemase producers. Against renal dehydropeptidase-I, LJC 11,036 was more stable than imipenem. Furthermore, LJC 11,036 produced in vitro postantibiotic sub-MIC effects against PRSP HSC-3 (6.0 h at one-fourth the MIC) and H. influenzae LJ5 (9.2 h at one-half the MIC). LJC 11,036 showed high binding affinities for PBP1A, -1B, -2A/2X, -2B, and -3 of PRSP and for PBP1B, -2, -3A, and -3B of H. influenzae.
TI  - Opacity-associated protein A contributes to the binding of Haemophilus influenzae to chang epithelial cells.
AB  - Opacity-associated protein A (OapA), which is responsible for the transparent-colony phenotype of Haemophilus influenzae, has been implicated in the colonization of the nasopharynx in an infant rat model of carriage. In this report, we show that OapA mediates attachment to Chang epithelial cells examined by using genetically defined type b and nontypeable H. influenzae strains with or without OapA. We also showed that OapA was conserved among H. influenzae strains by comparing deduced amino acid sequences. Both recombinant OapA and polyclonal anti-OapA antiserum blocked the binding of H. influenzae to Chang epithelial cells, suggesting that the interaction of H. influenzae is specific to OapA. Moreover, the binding of recombinant OapA to epithelial cells further provided evidence that OapA can promote attachment of H. influenzae. Expression of oapA gene in a nonadherent Escherichia coli strain significantly increased the binding to Chang epithelial cells, and disruption of the oapA gene with kanamycin resistance cassette insertion resulted in a significant loss of binding. These findings demonstrate that OapA plays a role in H. influenzae binding to human conjunctival epithelial cells.
TI  - Isolation of an IgG monoclonal anti-dnaJ antibody from an immunoglobulin combinatorial library from a patient with rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previously, we showed that rheumatoid arthritis (RA) had both antibodies and T cells specific for the QKRAA-encompassing Escherichia coli dnaJ protein. These findings suggest that the bacteria induced anti-dnaJ responses may cross react with the human homolog of bacterial dnaJ in the joint, resulting in tissue damage. METHODS: We used the combinatorial library technique to isolate and characterize an IgG monoclonal anti-dnaJ antibody (designated CG1) from the blood of a patient with RA. RESULTS: Sequence analysis of CG1 revealed that its heavy and light chain V regions were respectively most homologous to the 3d279d VH4 and the O18 Vk1 genes. Interestingly, 3d279d is frequently expressed by B cells stimulated with staphylococcal enterotoxin; and O18 is the main gene employed by the Vk1 IgG antibodies against Haemophilus influenzae. CONCLUSION: The combinatorial immunoglobulin library method represents an interesting model of how to approach the isolation and characterization of antibody-like reagents in the elucidation of autoantigens in RA.
TI  - Sequence complexity and DNA curvature.
AB  - A linguistic complexity measure was applied to the complete genomes of HIV-1, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma genitalium, and to long human and yeast genomic fragments. Complexity values averaged over entire genomic sequences were compared, as were predicted average values of intrinsic DNA curvature. We found that both the most curved and the least complex fragments are located preferentially in non-coding parts of the genome. Analysis of location of the most curved and the simplest regions in bacteria showed that the low-complexity segments are preferentially located in close proximity to the highly curved sequences, which are, in turn, placed from 100 to 200 bases upstream to the start of the nearest coding sequence. We conclude that the parallel analysis of sequence complexity and DNA curvature might provide important information about sequence-structure-function relationship in genomes.
TI  - Susceptibility to levofloxacin of clinical isolates of bacteria from intensive care and haematology/oncology patients in Switzerland: a multicentre study.
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the susceptibility of clinical isolates to levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone with extended activity against Gram-positive bacteria, and other antibiotics in 12 Swiss clinical microbiology laboratories using the NCCLS disc diffusion technique. Isolates were prospectively collected from intensive care units (ICUs (59%), oncology wards (7%) and other units with haematology/oncology patients (34%) from June 1995 to March 1996. The levofloxacin breakpoints used were as recommended by the manufacturer. A total of 310 Gram-positive and 580 Gram-negative isolates from the respiratory tract (36%), skin/wounds (12%), blood (16%), urine (17%) and other sources (19%) were tested. The percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin was 100% for Enterococcus spp. (38 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (13), Streptococcus pneumoniae (65), Acinetobacter spp. (11), Citrobacter diversus (6), Citrobacter freundii (17), Klebsiella oxytoca (39), Morganella morganii (16), Proteus mirabilis (20), Proteus vulgaris (23), Serratia spp. (19), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (10) and Haemophilus influenzae (41). The percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin for Staphylococcus aureus (95 strains, including 2% MRSA) was 94%, coagulase-negative staphylococci (85) 65%, Enterobacter spp. (75) 99%, Escherichia coli (111) 97%, Klebsiella pneumoniae (45) 98% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (124) 87%. In conclusion, levofloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone to which the most common clinical isolates in Switzerland are susceptible. The susceptibility of Enterococcus spp. and S. pneumoniae to levofloxacin was particularly remarkable. This compound appears to be a promising therapeutic alternative for the treatment of Gram-positive infections.
TI  - [A consideration on the results of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities--gram-negative bacilli].
AB  - The results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare during the period of January 1993 to July 1995, were analyzed for typical Gram-negative bacilli in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. During these 3 years, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus mirabilis showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to fosfomycin (FOM) and Citrobacter freundii. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes showed slightly increasing tendency to minocycline (MINO). While Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefmetazole (CMZ). However, these annual changes were almost negligible. Generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against Gram-negative bacilli. However, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. On the other hand, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST), CMZ, latamoxef (LMOX), gentamicin (GM) and amikacin (AMK) showed good activities against some of the Gram-negative bacilli to which no indications are approved. In conclusion, bedside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of antimicrobial agents is necessary.
TI  - Computer analysis of transcription regulatory patterns in completely sequenced bacterial genomes.
AB  - Recognition of transcription regulation sites (operators) is a hard problem in computational molecular biology. In most cases, small sample size and low degree of sequence conservation preclude the construction of reliable recognition rules. We suggest an approach to this problem based on simultaneous analysis of several related genomes. It appears that as long as a gene coding for a transcription regulator is conserved in the compared bacterial genomes, the regulation of the respective group of genes (regulons) also tends to be maintained. Thus a gene can be confidently predicted to belong to a particular regulon in case not only itself, but also its orthologs in other genomes have candidate operators in the regulatory regions. This provides for a greater sensitivity of operator identification as even relatively weak signals are likely to be functionally relevant when conserved. We use this approach to analyze the purine (PurR), arginine (ArgR) and aromatic amino acid (TrpR and TyrR) regulons of Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae. Candidate binding sites in regulatory regions of the respective H.influenzae genes are identified, a new family of purine transport proteins predicted to belong to the PurR regulon is described, and probable regulation of arginine transport by ArgR is demonstrated. Differences in the regulation of some orthologous genes in E.coli and H.influenzae, in particular the apparent lack of the autoregulation of the purine repressor gene in H.influenzae, are demonstrated.
TI  - Resistance problems in two university hospitals in Denmark.
AB  - In 1997, 80 and 89% of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from university hospitals in Odense and Hvidovre respectively were resistant to penicillin and 32.0 and 41% of Escherichia coli were resistant to ampicillin. There were low incidences of methicillin resistance in S. aureus (<1%), penicillin resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae (3%),and gentamicin in E. coli (2%). These figures might reflect the low use of antibiotics in Denmark.
TI  - Bactericidal properties of moxifloxacin and post-antibiotic effect.
AB  - The time-kill kinetics and post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of moxifloxacin were studied for strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Moxifloxacin had a bactericidal effect against all strains tested, with the least rapid bactericidal effect being against S. pyogenes and the most rapid effect against S. aureus and E. coli. The PAE of moxifloxacin was similar to that of other fluoroquinolones and increased with increasing concentration. No association was found between the bactericidal effect of moxifloxacin and the duration of PAE. Gram-positive and gram-negative organisms were also exposed to concentrations of moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin and amoxycillin that simulated the drug concentrations obtained in human serum after standard oral dosing schedules. Simulation of moxifloxacin concentrations in human serum reduced viable counts more effectively and more rapidly than shown in time-kill experiments; in contrast, sparfloxacin and amoxycillin were less effective than when constant concentrations of these antibacterials were used.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and accumulation of moxifloxacin in quinolone-susceptible  bacteria.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of moxifloxacin, compared with that of ciprofloxacin,  was determined for five strains of Staphylococcus aureus, including one NorA-overproducing strain, two quinolone-susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, four quinolone-susceptible strains of Haemophilus influenzae, and one strain each of quinolone-susceptible Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Moraxella catarrhalis. In addition, the accumulation of moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin by the NCTC type strain of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa was determined by a fluorescence method. For all strains, moxifloxacin accumulated to a lower concentration than ciprofloxacin. The concentrations of moxifloxacin accumulated ranged from 12 to 44 ng/mg dry cells. The lowest concentration was accumulated by S. pneumoniae NCTC 7465 and the highest concentration by S. aureus NCTC 8532. Increased expression of norA in S. aureus had no effect on the accumulation of moxifloxacin. Despite differences in the concentration of moxifloxacin accumulated by the different species, there was little difference between the MICs of this agent for each strain (0.06-0.5 mg/L), suggesting that the concentration accumulated by wild-type bacteria has little effect on the MIC.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of simple coumarins: structural requirements for biological activity.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a series of simple coumarins was evaluated against  8 microorganisms, including three Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) and five Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Haemophilus influenzae), using the microdilution broth method. The coumarins tested showed broad diversity regarding growth inhibitory activity with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.9 to > 12.4 microM. This study, presenting the first systematic analysis of structure-activity relationships among this group of coumarins, revealed some interesting structural requirements. While coumarins with a methoxy function at C-7 and, if present, an OH group at either the C-6 or C-8 position are invariably effective against the spectrum of tested standard bacteria (Gram-negative microorganisms including the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus), the presence of an aromatic dimethoxy arrangement is apparently favourable against those microorganisms which require special growth factors (beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae). A combination of these structural features, two methoxy functions and at least one additional phenolic group as reflected by the highly oxygenated coumarins, identify promising candidates with antibacterial broad-spectrum activity.
TI  - Characterization of gram-positive tellurite resistance encoded by the Streptococcus pneumoniae tehB gene.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae is a Gram-positive bacterium which is naturally resistant to tellurite. In this study, we cloned and sequenced a homologue of the Escherichia coli tellurite resistance gene tehB from S. pneumoniae. It encoded a protein of 284 amino acids which is 86 residues longer than E. coli TehB, but similar in size to Haemophilus influenzae TehB and Eikenella corrodens hemagglutinin (Hag1) as well as homologues from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis. The S. pneumoniae TehB displayed 46-58% identity (52-68% similarity) to these proteins. The results in this study showed that the S. pneumoniae tehB alone not only conferred on E. coli high level resistance to tellurite, but also caused filamentous morphology in E. coli.
TI  - Recurrent infections in homozygous sickle cell disease.
AB  - The characteristics of 214 episodes of invasive bacterial infection among 176 patients with homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease were examined. Streptococcus pneumoniae occurred in 81 episodes, Salmonella spp in 70, Haemophilus influenzae type b in 30, Escherichia coli in 24, and Klebsiella spp in nine. The cumulative incidence showed that S pneumoniae and H influenzae occurred predominantly before 5 years of age and were uncommon thereafter, Salmonella spp increased almost linearly with age, and Klebsiella spp and E coli predominated in patients over 10 years of age. Escherichia coli had a different epidemiology-it was found in older children, almost entirely girls. Excluding this organism from an analysis of recurrent bacterial infections, the standardised incidence rates for second and third infections were 4.8 and 15.8 times greater, respectively, than the SS population average. This implies that the susceptibility to infection is characteristic of a subgroup of patients with SS disease and that sick patients with previous bacteraemia should be investigated early and aggressively for further infection.
TI  - [Computer analysis of regulatory signals in complete bacterial genomes. Participation of PurR binding].
AB  
TI  - Histidinol phosphate phosphatase, catalyzing the penultimate step of the histidine biosynthesis pathway, is encoded by ytvP (hisJ) in Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - The deduced product of the Bacillus subtilis ytvP gene is similar to that of ORF13, a gene of unknown function in the Lactococcus lactis histidine biosynthesis operon. A B. subtilis ytvP mutant was auxotrophic for histidine. The only enzyme of the histidine biosynthesis pathway that remained uncharacterized in B. subtilis was histidinol phosphate phosphatase (HolPase), catalyzing the penultimate step of this pathway. HolPase activity could not be detected in crude extracts of the ytvP mutant, while purified glutathione S-transferase-YtvP fusion protein exhibited strong HolPase activity. These observations demonstrated that HolPase is encoded by ytvP in B. subtilis and led us to rename this gene hisJ. Together with the HolPase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the presumed HolPases of L. lactis and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, HisJ constitutes a family of related enzymes that are not homologous to the HolPases of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Haemophilus influenzae.
TI  - Structural requirements of the major protective antibody to Haemophilus influenzae type b.
AB  - Protective antibodies to the important childhood pathogen Haemophilus influenzae  type b (Hib) are directed against the capsular polysaccharide (HibCP). Most of the antibody is encoded by a well-defined set of ("canonical") immunoglobulin genes, including the Vkappa A2 gene, and expresses an idiotypic marker (HibId-1). In comparison to noncanonical antibodies, the canonical antibody is generally of higher avidity, shows higher levels of in vitro bactericidal activity, and is more protective in infant rats. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we here characterize canonical HibCP antibodies expressed as antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) in Escherichia coli, define amino acids involved in antigen binding and idiotype expression, and propose a three-dimensional structure for the variable domains. We found that canonical Fabs, unlike a noncanonical Fab, bound effectively to HibCP in the absence of somatic mutations. Nevertheless, pronounced mutation-based affinity maturation was demonstrated in vivo. An almost perfect correlation was found between unmutated gene segments that mediated binding in vitro and those encoding canonical HibCP antibodies in vivo. Thus, the Vkappa A2a gene could be replaced by the A2c gene but not by the highly homologous sister gene, A18b, corresponding to the demonstrated usage of A2c but not of A18b in vivo. Similarly, only Jkappa1 and Jkappa3, which predominate in the response in vivo, were able to facilitate binding in vitro. These findings suggest that the restricted immunoglobulin gene usage in HibCP antibodies reflects strict structural demands ensuring relatively high affinity prior to somatic mutations-requirements met by only a limited spectrum of immunoglobulin gene combinations.
TI  - Characterization of hgpA, a gene encoding a haemoglobin/haemoglobin-haptoglobin-binding protein of Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Haemophilus haemoglobin-haptoglobin complex and utilizes either as a sole source  of haem. Previously, a DNA fragment was cloned from H. influenzae that encodes an approximately 120 kDa protein (HgpA) expressing haemoglobin-binding activity in Escherichia coli. Partial sequence analysis revealed significant homology of HgpA with other bacterial haem- and iron-utilization proteins, and a length of CCAA repeating units immediately following the nucleotide sequence encoding the putative leader peptide. In the present study, the complete nucleotide sequence of the cloned DNA fragment was determined and the sequence was analysed. In addition to homology with other haem- and iron-utilization proteins, seven regions typical of TonB-dependent proteins were identified. The transcript of hgpA was determined to be monocistronic by RT-PCR. PCR performed with different colonies of a single H. influenzae strain at one CCAA-repeat-containing locus indicated varying lengths of CCAA repeats, suggesting that haemoglobin and haemoglobin-haptoglobin binding in H. influenzae is regulated by strand slippage across CCAA repeats, as well as by haem repression. E. coli containing cloned hgpA bound both haemoglobin and the haemoglobin-haptoglobin complex. A deletion/insertion mutation of hgpA was constructed in H. influenzae strain H1689. Mutation of hgpA did not affect the ability of H. influenzae either to bind or to utilize haemoglobin or haemoglobin-haptoglobin following growth in haem-deplete media. Affinity purification of haemoglobin-binding proteins from the mutant strain revealed loss of the 120 kDa protein and an increased amount of a 115 kDa protein, suggesting that at least one additional haemoglobin-binding protein exists.
TI  - Korean Nationwide Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance of bacteria in 1997.
AB  - Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria are known to be prevalent in tertiary-care hospitals in Korea. Twenty hospitals participated to this surveillance to determine the nationwide prevalence of resistance bacteria in 1997. Seven per cent and 26% of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were resistant to 3rd-generation cephalosporin. Increased resistance rates, 19% of Acinetobacter baumannii to ampicillin/sulbactam, and 17% of Pseudomonas aeruginoa to imipenem, were noted. The resistance rate to fluoroquinolone rose to 24% in E. coli, 56% in A. baumannii and 42% in P. aeruginosa. Mean resistance rates were similar in all hospital groups: about 17% of P. aeruginosa to imipenem, 50% of Haemophilus influenzae to ampicillin, 70% of Staphylococcus aureus to methicillin, and 70% of pneumococci to penicillin. In conclusion, nosocomial pathogens and problem resistant organisms are prevalent in smaller hospitals too, indicating nosocomial spread is a significant cause of the increasing prevalence of resistant bacteria in Korea.
TI  - acs1 of Haemophilus influenzae type a capsulation locus region II encodes a bifunctional ribulose 5-phosphate reductase- CDP-ribitol pyrophosphorylase.
AB  - The serotype-specific, 5.9-kb region II of the Haemophilus influenzae type a capsulation locus was sequenced and found to contain four open reading frames termed acs1 to acs4. Acs1 was 96% identical to H. influenzae type b Orf1, previously shown to have CDP-ribitol pyrophosphorylase activity (J. Van Eldere, L. Brophy, B. Loynds, P. Celis, I. Hancock, S. Carman, J. S. Kroll, and E. R. Moxon, Mol. Microbiol. 15:107-118, 1995). Low but significant homology to other pyrophosphorylases was only detected in the N-terminal part of Acs1, whereas the C-terminal part was homologous to several short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases, suggesting that Acs1 might be a bifunctional enzyme. To test this hypothesis, acs1 was cloned in an expression vector and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Cells expressing this protein displayed both ribitol 5-phosphate dehydrogenase and CDP-ribitol pyrophosphorylase activities, whereas these activities were not detectable in control cells. Acs1 was purified to near homogeneity and found to copurify with ribitol 5-phosphate dehydrogenase and CDP-ribitol pyrophosphorylase activities. These had superimposable elution profiles from DEAE-Sepharose and Blue-Sepharose columns. The dehydrogenase activity was specific for ribulose 5-phosphate and NADPH in one direction and for ribitol 5-phosphate and NADP+ in the other direction and was markedly stimulated by CTP. The pyrophosphorylase showed activity with CTP and ribitol 5-phosphate or arabitol 5-phosphate. We conclude that acs1 encodes a bifunctional enzyme that converts ribulose 5-phosphate into ribitol 5-phosphate and further into CDP-ribitol, which is the activated precursor form for incorporation of ribitol 5-phosphate into the H. influenzae type a capsular polysaccharide.
TI  - The Mycobacterium tuberculosis recA intein can be used in an ORFTRAP to select for open reading frames.
AB  - The DNA repair protein RecA of Mycobacterium tuberculosis contains an intein, a self-splicing protein element. We have employed this Mtu recA intein to create a selection system for successful intein splicing by inserting it into a kanamycin-resistance gene so that functional antibiotic resistance can only be restored upon protein splicing. We then proceeded to develop an ORFTRAP, i.e., a selection system for the cloning of open reading frames (ORFs). The ORFTRAP exploits the self-splicing properties of inteins (which depend on full-length in-frame translation of a precursor protein) by allowing protein splicing to occur when DNA fragments encoding ORFs are inserted into the Mtu recA intein, whereas DNA fragments containing non-ORFs are selected against. Regions of the Mtu recA intein that tolerate the insertion of additional amino acids were identified by Bgl II linker scanning mutagenesis, and a respective construct was chosen as the ORFTRAP. To test the maximum insert size that could be cloned into ORFTRAP, DNA fragments of increasing length from the Listeria monocytogenes hly gene as well as a genomic library of Haemophilus influenzae were inserted and it was found that the longest permissive inserts were 425 bp and 251 bp, respectively. The H. influenzae ORFTRAP library also demonstrated the strength (strong selection power) and weakness (insertion of very small fragments) of the system. Further modifications should make the ORFTRAP useful for protein expression, epitope mapping, and antigen screening.
TI  - Mapping the active site of the Haemophilus influenzae methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase: residues important for catalysis and tRNA binding.
AB  - Formylation of the initiator methionyl-tRNA by methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase (MTF) is an essential step in initiation of protein synthesis in eubacteria. Here, site-directed mutagenesis was used to identify active site residues of the Haemophilus influenzae MTF. Of the nine residues investigated, only Arg-41, Asn-107, His-109 and Asp-145 were important for the function of the H. influenzae MTF. Replacement of these residues with Ala resulted in a significant reduction in the efficiency of catalysis. Intrinsic fluorescence analysis indicated that this was not due to a defect in N10-formyltetrahydrofolate (fTHF) binding. The Asp-145 and Arg-41 mutations reduced the affinity of the enzyme for the initiator tRNA, whereas the Asn-107 and His-109 mutations affected catalysis but not tRNA binding. Replacement of Arg-41, His-109 and Asp-145 with functionally similar residues also affected the activity of the enzyme. The data suggest that Asn-107, His-109 and Asp-145 are catalytic residues, whereas Arg-41 is involved in tRNA recognition. In the Escherichia coli glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase, which also uses fTHF as the formyl donor, Asn-106, His-108 and Asp-144 participate in the catalytic step. Together, these observations imply that this group of enzymes uses the same basic mechanism in formylating their substrates.
TI  - Characterization of the gene encoding a 26-kilodalton protein (OMP26) from nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae and immune responses to the recombinant protein.
AB  - A 26-kDa protein (OMP26) isolated and purified from nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) strain 289 has been shown to enhance clearance of infection following pulmonary challenge with NTHI in rats. DNA sequence analysis revealed that it was 99% identical to a gene encoding a cell envelope protein of the H. influenzae Rd strain (TIGR accession no. HI0916). The deduced amino acid sequence revealed a hydrophilic polypeptide rich in basic amino acids. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis suggested that the OMP26 gene was relatively conserved among isolates of NTHI. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of the OMP26 gene from 20 different isolates showed that similarity with NTHI-289 ranged from 96.5% (1 isolate) to 99.5% (14 isolates). Two recombinant forms of OMP26, a full length 28-kDa protein (equivalent to preprotein) and a 26-kDa protein lacking a 23-amino-acid leader peptide (equivalent to processed protein), were assessed in immunization studies for the ability to induce an immune response that would be as effective as the native protein in enhancing the clearance of NTHI following pulmonary challenge in rats. Immunization with the recombinant protein that included the leader peptide was more effective in enhancing pulmonary clearance, and it induced a better cell-mediated response and higher titers of systemic and mucosal antibody. This study has characterized a 26-kDa protein from NTHI that shows significant potential as a vaccine candidate.
TI  - The structure and function of the 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase from Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The gene encoding the 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase of Haemophilus influenzae has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. A complex of the purified protein with a substrate analog has been crystallized and its structure solved by multiple anomalous dispersion using phase information obtained from a single crystal of selenomethione-labeled protein. The enzyme folds into a four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet flanked on one side by two alpha-helices and on the other by three consecutive alpha-helices, giving a novel beta1alpha1beta2beta3alpha2beta4alpha3alpha4alpha5 polypeptide topology. The three-dimensional structure of a binary complex has been refined at 2.1 A resolution. The location of the substrate analog and a sulfate ion gives important insight into the molecular mechanism of the enzyme.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a DNA probe for Staphylococcus aureus subspecies aureus biovar.
AB  - The gene encoding for polynucleotide phosphorylase (pnp) of a new biovar of Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus (NBSA) has been isolated from a genomic library of strain M280(0). The coding region consisted of a 1094-bp HindIII-HindIII DNA fragment encoding for a protein of 277 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 29.5 kDa. The nucleotide sequence of the structural gene, contained a continuous open reading frame of 836 bp, showed significant homology with the genes of bacterial polynucleotide phosphorylase from Bacillus subtilis (67.7% identity), from Haemophilus influenzae (62.4% identity), from Pseudomonas luminescens (61.6% identity), and from Escherichia coli (59.7% identity). DNA-DNA and DNA-colony slot-blot hybridizations demonstrated that the pnp gene, employed as a molecular probe, is specific for the identification of NBSA strains.
TI  - Evolutionary relationships among diverse bacteriophages and prophages: all the world's a phage.
AB  - We report DNA and predicted protein sequence similarities, implying homology, among genes of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) bacteriophages and prophages spanning a broad phylogenetic range of host bacteria. The sequence matches reported here establish genetic connections, not always direct, among the lambdoid phages of Escherichia coli, phage phiC31 of Streptomyces, phages of Mycobacterium, a previously unrecognized cryptic prophage, phiflu, in the Haemophilus influenzae genome, and two small prophage-like elements, phiRv1 and phiRv2, in the genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The results imply that these phage genes, and very possibly all of the dsDNA tailed phages, share common ancestry. We propose a model for the genetic structure and dynamics of the global phage population in which all dsDNA phage genomes are mosaics with access, by horizontal exchange, to a large common genetic pool but in which access to the gene pool is not uniform for all phage.
TI  - Comparison of synonymous codon distribution patterns of bacteriophage and host genomes.
AB  - Synonymous codon usage patterns of bacteriophage and host genomes were compared.  Two indexes, G + C base composition of a gene (fgc) and fraction of translationally optimal codons of the gene (fop), were used in the comparison. Synonymous codon usage data of all the coding sequences on a genome are represented as a cloud of points in the plane of fop vs. fgc. The Escherichia coli coding sequences appear to exhibit two phases, "rising" and "flat" phases. Genes that are essential for survival and are thought to be native are located in the flat phase, while foreign-type genes from prophages and transposons are found in the rising phase with a slope of nearly unity in the fgc vs. fop plot. Synonymous codon distribution patterns of genes from temperate phages P4, P2, N15 and lambda are similar to the pattern of E. coli rising phase genes. In contrast, genes from the virulent phage T7 or T4, for which a phage-encoded DNA polymerase is identified, fall in a linear curve with a slope of nearly zero in the fop vs. fgc plane. These results may suggest that the G + C contents for T7, T4 and E. coli flat phase genes are subject to the directional mutation pressure and are determined by the DNA polymerase used in the replication. There is significant variation in the fop values of the phage genes, suggesting an adjustment to gene expression level. Similar analyses of codon distribution patterns were carried out for Haemophilus influenzae, Bacillus subtilis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and their phages with complete genomic sequences available.
TI  - Site-specific recombination at dif by Haemophilus influenzae XerC.
AB  - Xer site-specific recombination at the Escherichia coli chromosomal site dif converts chromosomal dimers to monomers, thereby allowing chromosome segregation during cell division. dif is located in the replication terminus region and binds the E. coli site-specific recombinases EcoXerC and EcoXerD. The Haemophilus influenzae Xer homologues, HinXerC and HinXerD, bind E. coli dif and exchange strands of dif Holliday junctions in vitro. Supercoiled dif sites are not recombined by EcoXerC and EcoXerD in vitro, possibly as a consequence of a regulatory process, which ensures that in vivo recombination at dif is confined to cells that can initiate cell division and contain dimeric chromosomes. In contrast, the combined action of HinXerC and EcoXerD supports in vitro recombination between supercoiled dif sites, thereby overcoming the barrier to dif recombination exhibited by EcoXerC and EcoXerD. The recombination products are catenated and knotted molecules, consistent with recombination occurring with synaptic complexes that have entrapped variable numbers of negative supercoils. Use of catalytically inactive recombinases provides support for a recombination pathway in which HinXerC-mediated strand exchange between directly repeated duplex dif sites generates a Holliday junction intermediate that is resolved by EcoXerD to catenated products. These can undergo a second recombination reaction to generate odd-noded knots.
TI  - A method for the purification and refolding of a recombinant form of the nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae P5 outer membrane protein fused to polyhistidine.
AB  - Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is an opportunistic pathogen, commonly  associated with otitis media and exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. Studies concerning the pathogenesis of NTHi have proposed an important function for P5, an outer membrane protein believed to play a role in the initiation of infection by mediating adherence to respiratory mucin. P5 has also generated interest as a potential vaccine candidate. In a previous study, an NTHi library screen with antibodies raised against P5 purified from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) demonstrated that the purified protein was contaminated with closely migrating proteins. Consequently, the aim of this study was to express P5 in a heterologous system to overcome potential contamination with NTHi proteins that may complicate analytical or vaccine studies. Recombinant P5, with an N terminal extension of 10 residues that included six histidines, was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The rP5 was purified with the Talon metal affinity resin in a denatured form and then refolded by incorporation into mixed-detergent micelles of octylglucoside and SDS. Circular dichroism of the refolded rP5 demonstrated 55% beta-strand content, which is consistent with the beta-strand content of native P5 and the homologous E. coli protein OmpA.
TI  - Evaluation of an extended diagnostic PCR assay for detection and verification of  the common causes of bacterial meningitis in CSF and other biological samples.
AB  - A seminested polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostic assay was evaluated for detection and verification of Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Steptococcus agalactiae and Listeria monocytogenes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and other biological samples. A general bacterial amplicon from the 16S rRNA gene was amplified in a first step, and species-specific regions in a second. The detection level was 4 fg DNA/reaction, corresponding to about one bacterial genome per reaction tube. Sample preparations (Dynabeads DNA DIRECT kit) were assayed from 140 bacterial strains suspended in saline. In CSF the detection level for bacteria was 10(3)CFU ml-1for N. meningitidis, H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae, 10(4)CFU ml-1for Escherichia coli and 10(5)CFU ml-1for S. agalactiae and L. monocytogenes. The detection levels for these bacteria were the same in the other tested biological samples, like blood with or without culture media. Clinical CSF samples were evaluated from 71 patients with proven bacterial meningitis, as were 61 CSF samples from individuals without bacterial meningitis. The diagnostic sensitivity of the assay in detecting bacteria in general was 0.97, and for the specific species in the clinical CSF samples 0.87-0.94. The specificity was 1.0 for detecting bacteria in general. Some cross-reactions were noted within the streptococcus group. The PCR results were verified by banding patterns of Hae III digested PCR products.

TI  - The structural and functional organization of H-NS-like proteins is evolutionarily conserved in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The structural gene of the H-NS protein, a global regulator of bacterial metabolism, has been identified in the group of enterobacteria as well as in closely related bacteria, such as Erwinia chrysanthemi and Haemophilus influenzae. Isolated outside these groups, the BpH3 protein of Bordetella pertussis exhibits a low amino acid conservation with H-NS, particularly in the N-terminal domain. To obtain information on the structure, function and/or evolution of H-NS, we searched for other H-NS-related proteins in the latest databases. We found that HvrA, a trans-activator protein in Rhodobacter capsulatus, has a low but significant similarity with H-NS and H-NS-like proteins. This Gram-negative bacterium is phylogenetically distant from Escherichia coli. Using theoretical analysis (e.g. secondary structure prediction and DNA binding domain modelling) of the amino acid sequence of H-NS, StpA (an H-NS-like protein in E. coli), BpH3 and HvrA and by in vivo and in vitro experiments (e.g. complementation of various H-NS-related phenotypes and competitive gel shift assay), we present evidence that these proteins belong to the same class of DNA binding proteins. In silico analysis suggests that this family also includes SPB in R. sphaeroides, XrvA in Xanthomonas oryzae and VicH in Vibrio cholerae. These results demonstrate that proteins structurally and functionally related to H-NS are widespread in Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Tetranucleotide repeats identify novel virulence determinant homologues in Neisseria meningitidis.
AB  - Numerous outer membrane components of Neisseria meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae exhibit phase variable expression (the rapid, reversible on/off switching of phenotypic expression). Many of the genes encoding these outer membrane components contain simple repetitive DNA motifs (mononucleotides, dinucleotides, tetranucleotides and other repeats) which mediate this variation. One such repeat motif, the tetranucleotide 5;-(GCAA)n-3;, is associated with phase-variable LPS biosynthetic genes in the pathogen Haemophilus influenzae. We have previously shown that N. meningitidis strain MC58 contains this repeat motif in at least three distinct genetic loci. In this study all three of these loci were investigated: two were cloned and identified as novel loci and designated nmrep1 and nmrep2. The third locus was assigned to a previously cloned gene and here is designated nmrep3. The distribution of these loci, and the number of repeat units at each locus was investigated in a range of strains. This analysis revealed that the nmrep1 and nmrep2 loci are present in all 45 strains examined, with 41/45 containing nmrep3. Sequences associated with nmrep1 showed no homology with reported proteins, but amino acid sequences of open reading frames of nmrep2 and nmrep3 exhibited sequence homology to the adhesins Aida of Escherichia coli and Prn of Bordetella sppand IcsA of Shigella flexneri which is involved in intracellular spread.
TI  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa fur overlaps with a gene encoding a novel outer membrane lipoprotein, OmlA.
AB  - A novel outer membrane lipoprotein in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is encoded by the omlA gene, which was identified immediately upstream of the fur (ferric uptake regulator) gene. The omlA and fur genes were divergently transcribed and had overlapping promoter regions. The proximal fur P2 promoter and the omlA promoter shared a 5-bp DNA motif for their -10 promoter elements. The distal fur P1 promoter was located within the omlA coding sequence, and the omlA and fur T1 mRNAs overlapped by 154 nucleotides. Optimal expression of both fur and omlA required roughly 200 bp of DNA upstream of the promoter regions, suggesting the presence of cis-acting transcriptional activation elements located within the omlA and fur genes, respectively. The levels of Fur and OmlA proteins had no influence on omlA or fur expression, excluding any trans-acting cross-regulation between fur and omlA. Expression of omlA was constitutive regardless of growth phase, oxygen tension, iron concentration, pH, and temperature. OmlA contained a signal sequence typical of bacterial lipoproteins, with a cysteine as a putative cleavage and lipid attachment site. Inhibition of signal peptidase II by globomycin resulted in failure to process OmlA, thus giving strong evidence that OmlA is a lipoprotein. Cell fractionation followed by Western blot analysis indicated that all OmlA protein is localized in the outer membrane. Mature OmlA was an acidic (pI = 4. 5) protein of 17.3 kDa and had close to 40% amino acid sequence identity to SmpA (small protein A) of Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, and Haemophilus influenzae, a protein of unknown function. All P. aeruginosa strains tested as well as Pseudomonas fluorescens were found to produce OmlA. A mutant strain with impaired production of OmlA but no change in the expression of the overlapping fur gene was constructed. The omlA mutant was hypersusceptible to anionic detergents such as sodium dodecyl sulfate and deoxycholate, and it showed increased susceptibility to various antibiotics, including nalidixic acid, rifampin, novobiocin, and chloramphenicol. A structural role of OmlA in maintaining the cell envelope integrity is proposed.
TI  - In vitro activity of meropenem against common pathogenic bacteria isolated in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in Taiwan. Meropenem was active against most Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacteroides fragilis. For many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. It is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. It is uncommon for these common bacteria, except MRSA and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in Taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.
TI  - Physical and genetic map of the genome of Buchnera, the primary endosymbiont of the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum.
AB  - The genome of Buchnera, an endosymbiotic bacterium of the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, was characterized by pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) as a circular DNA molecule of 657 kb. The enzymes I-CeuI, CpoI, ApaI, SmaI, NaeI, SacII, MluI, FspI, and NruI were used to cleave the DNA of Buchnera into fragments of suitable size for PFGE analysis. A physical map of the Buchnera genome, including restriction fragments from seven of these enzymes, was constructed using double cutting, partial digestion, and hybridization with linking fragments, and 29 genes and operons were localized on the map. In addition, the genomic map of Buchnera was compared with those of Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae. The gene order in Buchnera is more similar to that of E. coli than to H. influenzae. The dramatic shrinkage of the Buchnera genome compared with those of other members of the closely related Enterobacteriaceae family is discussed in terms of evolution under the influence of the intracellular symbiotic association.

TI  - Escherichia coli ATCC 35218 as a quality control isolate for susceptibility testing of Haemophilus influenzae with haemophilus test medium.
AB  - Current National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) susceptibility guidelines for quality control testing with Haemophilus influenzae do not include a beta-lactamase-producing strain that could detect the deterioration of the beta-lactamase inhibitor components of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin-sulbactam, and piperacillin-tazobactam. The objective of the study was to determine if comparable quality control results for Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, a beta-lactamase-producing strain, would be produced for the three beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor agents with Haemophilus test medium and Mueller-Hinton medium. The criteria used in this study to determine if Haemophilus test medium was acceptable for quality control testing of E. coli ATCC 35218 was that 100% of the results obtained with an antimicrobial agent-methodology combination needed to be within the acceptable NCCLS ranges established with Mueller-Hinton medium. The MIC testing results obtained by the broth microdilution and E-test methods with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and piperacillin-tazobactam were all within the NCCLS ranges; however, the results obtained with ampicillin-sulbactam by both methods were not within the NCCLS ranges. Acceptable results were obtained by the disk diffusion methodology with ampicillin-sulbactam and piperacillin-tazobactam but not with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. When performing susceptibility testing with H. influenzae with the beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitors, in addition to quality control testing with H. influenzae ATCC 49247, testing of E. coli ATCC 35218 on Haemophilus test medium is an effective way to monitor the beta-lactamase inhibitors in some antimicrobial agent-methodology combinations.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the urine of children with urinary tract infections from 1986 to 1995].
AB  - In adults and in children urinary system infections are mostly caused by gram-negative and rarely by gram-positive bacteria. Of gram-negative bacteria the most frequent cause of infections are Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Serratia etc., and of gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus agalactiae. In rare cases the cause of infection may also be Pneumococcus and Haemophilus influenzae. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the study was to investigate the sensitivity to antibiotics of gram-negative bacteria as the predominant cause of urinary infections. METHOD OF THE STUDY: We isolated 20,615 bacterium species from urine of children hospitalized or treated as outpatients at the University Children's Hospital in Belgrade. Urine was collected classically, i.e. by taking the second clean stream into a sterile test tube or by Uricult test. The samples were cultured on blood plates and endo-agar. Identification was done by standard bacteriologic methods and when findings were dubious API-20E (bioMerieux) was used. Bacterium sensitivity to nine antibiotics (ampicillin, cephalexin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, amikacin, co-trimoxazole, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin) was assessed with disc diffuse method on Muller-Hinton agars. RESULTS: Based on the obtained results, Escherichia coli species sensitivity to amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin ranged from 90 to 100%; sensitivity to co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol ranged from 70 to 80%, to cephalexin from 50 to 60%, while to ampicillin it was only 20%. Klebsiella species sensitivity to nalidixic acid and cefotaxime was 70-85%; to amikacin, cefotaxime, co-trimoxazole and gentamicin 60-80%; to cephalexin and chloramphenicol 40-50%, and to ampicillin only 5-15%. Proteus species showed sensitivity to amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime and nalidixic acid of 90-95%; to co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol 70-80%; to cephalexin and ampicillin 40-50%, and to nitrofurantoin 10%. Pseudomonas aeruginosa species showed the highest level of sensitivity to amikacin (40-50%), and somewhat lower to gentamicin (10-40%), and a very low sensitivity to other antimicrobial drugs (10-25%). DISCUSSION: It may be noted from the above data that gram-negative bacteria are the cause of urinary infections in about 90% of cases, while gram-positive bacteria are the cause in only 10%, which is in accordance with data from literature. Of all antibiotic drugs ampicillin (a wide spectrum penicillin) had a very significant role in the therapy of urinary infections. However, the long-term usage of ampicillin led to increased resistance to the drug in infections caused by Escherichia coli. Natural resistance to ampicillin of Klebsiella species limited its usage when penicillin was first introduced. Proteus mirabilis species, especially those isolate in primary infection, are often sensitive to amino penicillin. Contrary to Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus and Providentie species show a high resistance to these antibiotics. Due to the crisis in our country and the lack of other antibiotics, ampicillin was widely used. The wide use of the drug caused evident resistance of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis to this antibiotic. A fall in the sensitivity of Klebsiella to cephalexin, gentamicin, amikacin and co-timoxazole, which occurred in 1992, has been explained by intrahospital circulation of multiresistant Klebsiella species. The sensitivity of isolated gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most prominent to aminoglycosides (amikacin and gentamicin). The most frequent mechanism of enterobacterial resistance to trimethoprim and co-trimoxazole involves dihydrofolate reductase enzyme. Comparative studies related to the administration of co-trimoxazole have shown that the difference in the efficacy between thes
TI  - Characterization of the avian pathogenic Escherichia coli hemagglutinin Tsh, a member of the immunoglobulin A protease-type family of autotransporters.
AB  - We reported earlier that a single gene, tsh, isolated from a strain of avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) was sufficient to confer on E. coli K-12 a hemagglutinin-positive phenotype and that the deduced sequence of the Tsh protein shared homology to the serine-type immunoglobulin A (IgA) proteases of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae. In this report we show that E. coli K-12 containing the recombinant tsh gene produced two proteins, a 106-kDa extracellular protein and a 33-kDa outer membrane protein, and was also able to agglutinate chicken erythrocytes. N-terminal sequence data indicated that the 106-kDa protein, designated Tshs, was derived from the N-terminal end of Tsh after the removal of a 52-amino-acid N-terminal signal peptide, while the 33-kDa protein, designated Tshbeta, was derived from the C-terminal end of Tsh starting at residue N1101. The Tshs domain contains the 7-amino-acid serine protease motif that includes the active-site serine (S259), found also in the secreted domains of the IgA proteases. However, site-directed mutagenesis of S259 did not abolish the hemagglutinin activity or the extracellular secretion of Tshs indicating that host-directed proteolysis was mediating the release of Tshs. Studies with an E. coli K-12 ompT mutant strain showed that the surface protease OmpT was not needed for the secretion of Tshs. Tsh belongs to a subclass of the IgA protease family, which also includes EspC of enteropathogenic E. coli, EspP of enterohemorragic E. coli, and SepA and VirG of Shigella flexneri, which seem to involve a host endopeptidase to achieve extracellular release of their N-terminal domains. In proteolytic studies conducted in vitro, Tshs did not cleave the substrate of the IgA proteases, human IgA1 or chicken IgA, and did not show proteolytic activity in a casein-based assay. Correlation of Tsh expression and hemagglutination activity appears to be a very complex phenomenon, influenced by strain and environmental conditions. Nevertheless, for both APEC and recombinant E. coli K-12 strains containing the tsh gene, it was only the whole bacterial cells and not the cell-free supernatants that could confer hemagglutinin activity. Our results provide insights into the expression, secretion, and proteolytic features of the Tsh protein, which belongs to the growing family of gram-negative bacterial extracellular virulence factors, named autotransporters, which utilize a self-mediated mechanism to achieve export across the bacterial cell envelope.
TI  - Use of an isogenic mutant constructed in Moraxella catarrhalis To identify a protective epitope of outer membrane protein B1 defined by monoclonal antibody 11C6.
AB  - Moraxella catarrhalis-induced otitis media continues to be a significant cause of infection in young children, prompting increased efforts at identifying effective vaccine antigens. We have previously demonstrated that M. catarrhalis expresses specific outer membrane proteins (OMPs) in response to iron limitation and that this organism can utilize transferrin and lactoferrin for in vitro growth. One of these proteins, which binds human transferrin, is OMP B1. As the human host presents a naturally iron-limited environment, proteins, like OMP B1, which are expressed in response to this nutritional stress are potential vaccine antigens. In this study, we have developed monoclonal antibody (MAb) 11C6, which reacts to a surface-exposed epitope of OMP B1 expressed by M. catarrhalis 7169. This antibody was used to clone ompB1, and sequence analysis suggested that OMP B1 is the M. catarrhalis homologue to the transferrin binding protein B described for pathogenic Neisseriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, and M. catarrhalis. Expression of recombinant OMP B1 on the surface of Escherichia coli confers transferrin binding activity, confirming that this protein is likely involved in iron acquisition. In addition, ompB1 was used to construct an isogenic mutant in M. catarrhalis 7169. This mutant, termed 7169b12, was used as the control in bactericidal assays designed to determine if OMP B1 elicits protective antibodies. In the presence of MAb 11C6 and human complement, wild-type 7169 demonstrated a 99% decline in viability, whereas the ompB1 isogenic mutant was resistant to this bactericidal activity. Further analysis with MAb 11C6 revealed the presence of this OMP B1 epitope on 31% of the clinical isolates tested. These data suggest that OMP B1 is a potential vaccine antigen against M. catarrhalis infections.
TI  - Cellulitis due to Escherichia coli in three immunocompromised subjects.
AB  - In adults, cellulitis is usually caused by group A streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. However, in patients with underlying disease, it may be caused by other organisms, such as Acinetobacter, Clostridium septicum, Enterobacter, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis or Escherichia coli. We report three cases of cellulitis of the lower legs where E. coli was the causative bacterial organism. It is important to suspect E. coli as a causative organism if blistering cellulitis occurs, especially in patients with underlying diseases.
TI  - Structural features of autoreactive TCR that determine the degree of degeneracy in peptide recognition.
AB  - Structural aspects of human TCRs that allow the activation of autoreactive T cells by diverse microbial peptides were examined using two human myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific T cell clones. The TCR sequences of these clones differed only in the N region of TCR-alpha and -beta since the clones had the same Valpha-Jalpha and Vbeta-Jbeta rearrangements. The two clones had a similar fine specificity for the MBP peptide, except for the P5 position of the peptide (lysine). In the crystal structure of the HLA-DR2/MBP peptide complex, P5 lysine is a prominent, solvent-exposed residue in the center of the DR2/MBP peptide surface. Five microbial peptides with conservative or nonconservative changes at the P5 position (lysine to arginine, serine, or proline) activated one of these clones. In contrast, the other clone was activated only by three of these peptides which had a conservative lysine to arginine change at P5. The degree of specificity/degeneracy in recognition of the P5 side chain was the key difference between these TCRs since the Escherichia coli/Haemophilus influenzae peptide stimulated both clones when the P5 position was substituted from serine to arginine. These results demonstrate that the complementarity-determining region 3 loops contribute to the degree of degeneracy in peptide recognition by human MBP-specific TCRs.
TI  - [Study on bacteremia due to community-acquired infection in infants and children  without underlying diseases].
AB  - Between July 1988 and June 1998, 22 pediatric patients without underlying diseases were diagnosed as bacteremia caused by community-acquired infection in Asahikawa Kosei Hospital. The age range of the patients was from 7 days to 4 years. Their diseases were meningitis in 6, urinary tract infection in 6, respiratory tract infection in 4, skin infection in 2, and unknown origin in 4. The causative organisms were Escherichia coli in 7, Haemophilus influenzae in 4, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 4, Staphylococcus aureus in 2, Streptococcus pyogenes in 1, Streptococcus agalactiae in 1, Listeria monocytogenes in 1, Moraxella catarrhalis in 1, and Rahnella aquatilis in 1. Though 21 patients recovered with antimicrobial treatment, only one patient with H. influenzae meningitis had lateral deafness and paresis in the lower limbs as sequelae.
TI  - Use of genomics to identify bacterial undecaprenyl pyrophosphate synthetase: cloning, expression, and characterization of the essential uppS gene.
AB  - The prenyltransferase undecaprenyl pyrophosphate synthetase (di-trans,poly-cis-decaprenylcistransferase; EC 2.5.1.31) was purified from the soluble fraction of Escherichia coli by TSK-DEAE, ceramic hydroxyapatite, TSK-ether, Superdex 200, and heparin-Actigel chromatography. The protein was labeled with the photolabile analogue of the farnesyl pyrophosphate analogue (E, E)-[1-3H]-(2-diazo-3-trifluoropropionyloxy)geranyl diphosphate and was detected on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel as a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 29 kDa. This protein band was cut out from the gel, trypsin digested, and subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometric analysis. Comparison of the experimental data with computer-simulated trypsin digest data for all E. coli proteins yielded a single match with a protein of unassigned function (SWISS-PROT Q47675; YAES_ECOLI). Sequences with strong similarity indicative of homology to this protein were identified in 25 bacterial species, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and in Caenorhabditis elegans. The homologous genes (uppS) were cloned from E. coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, expressed in E. coli as amino-terminal His-tagged fusion proteins, and purified over a Ni2+ affinity column. An untagged version of the E. coli uppS gene was also cloned and expressed, and the protein purified in two chromatographic steps. We were able to detect Upp synthetase activity for all purified enzymes. Further, biochemical characterization revealed no differences between the recombinant untagged E. coli Upp synthetase and the three His-tagged fusion proteins. All enzymes were absolutely Triton X-100 and MgCl2 dependent. With the use of a regulatable gene disruption system, we demonstrated that uppS is essential for growth in S. pneumoniae R6.
TI  - Isolated operator binding and ligand response domains of the TyrR protein of Haemophilus influenzae associate to reconstitute functional repressor.
AB  - Highly purified preparations of the TyrR protein of Haemophilus influenzae Rd undergo specific and limited proteolytic cleavage during storage at 4 degreesC to generate two fragments of 28 and 8 kDa. Under nondenaturing conditions, the two fragments remain tightly associated. Nicked TyrR is identical to full-length TyrR in its operator binding characteristics. The 8-kDa fragment containing amino acid residues 258-318 was separated from the 28-kDa fragment (residues 1-257) by gel filtration chromatography in the presence of 4 M urea. Upon renaturation, this fragment bound to operator with an affinity similar to that of full-length TyrR but was unresponsive to ligands that normally modulate operator binding (gamma-S-ATP and L-tyrosine). It was not possible to renature the urea-treated 28-kDa fragment. Highly purified soluble preparations of truncated TyrR containing residues 1-257 were obtained after the overexpression of a shortened form of the tyrR gene via a specific plasmid construct. By several criteria, this species had native secondary and tertiary structure. The 28-kDa fragment was unable to bind to operator but could reconstitute nicked TyrR when added to the renatured 8-kDa fragment, as shown by physical properties and responsiveness to cofactors in operator binding. When either the 28- or 8-kDa species was expressed in vivo, there was no detectable operator binding, as evaluated using a lacZ reporter system driven by the repressible aroF promoter. When the two fragments were co-expressed in a common cytoplasm, an operator-binding species was formed, as demonstrated through partial restoration of repression capability.
TI  - Catalytic properties of selenophosphate synthetases: comparison of the selenocysteine-containing enzyme from Haemophilus influenzae with the corresponding cysteine-containing enzyme from Escherichia coli.
AB  - The selD gene from Haemophilus influenzae has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The expressed protein was purified to homogeneity in a four-step procedure and then carboxymethylated by reaction with chloroacetate. N-terminal sequencing by Edman degradation identified residue 16 as carboxymethyl selenocysteine, which corresponded to the essential cysteine residue in the glycine-rich sequence of the E. coli selenophosphate synthetase. It would be expected that an ionized selenol of a selenocysteine in place of a catalytically essential cysteine residue would result in an enzyme with increased catalytic activity. To test this hypothesis we kinetically characterized the selenocysteine containing selenophosphate synthetase from H. influenzae and compared its catalytic activity to that of the cysteine containing selenophosphate synthetase from E. coli. Our characterization revealed the Km values for the two substrates, selenide and ATP, were similar for both enzymes. However, the selenocysteine-containing enzyme did not exhibit the expected higher catalytic activity. Based on these results we suggest a role of selenocysteine in H. influenzae that is not catalytic.
TI  - Synthesis of 6-O-methyl-azithromycin and its ketolide analogue via Beckmann rearrangement of 9(E)-6-O-methyl-erythromycin oxime.
AB  - The synthesis of 6-O-methyl-azithromycin and its aza-ketolide analogue have been  achieved by carrying out the Beckmann rearrangement of the readily available 9(E)-6-O-methyl-erythromycin oxime 1. In contrast to the C14 ketolides like HMR 3647, the aza-ketolide turns out to be inactive, thus demonstrating that the addition of a 3 keto function and ring expansion, from 14 to 15 membered ring, could be deleterious for the antibacterial activity.
TI  - 3-trifluoromethylcarbacephems: synthesis of broad spectrum antibacterial compounds.
AB  - The enhanced stability of the carbacephem nucleus over the corresponding cephalosporin nucleus has allowed the synthesis of 7-arylglycyl-3-trifluoromethyl-carbacephems. These unique carbacephems possess broad spectrum activity and high stability to both plasmid and chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases.
TI  - Genes from nine genomes are separated into their organisms in the dinucleotide composition space.
AB  - A set of 16 kinds of dinucleotide compositions was used to analyze the protein-encoding nucleotide sequences in nine complete genomes: Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Synechocystis sp., Methanococcus jannaschii, Archaeoglobus fulgidus, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The dinucleotide composition was significantly different between the organisms. The distribution of genes from an organism was clustered around its center in the dinucleotide composition space. The genes from closely related organisms such as Gram-negative bacteria, mycoplasma species and eukaryotes showed some overlap in the space. The genes from nine complete genomes together with those from human were discriminated into respective clusters with 80% accuracy using the dinucleotide composition alone. The composition data estimated from a whole genome was close to that obtained from genes, indicating that the characteristic feature of dinucleotides holds not only for protein coding regions but also noncoding regions. When a dendrogram was constructed from the disposition of the clusters in the dinucleotide space, it resembled the real phylogenetic tree. Thus, the distinct feature observed in the dinucleotide composition may reflect the phylogenetic relationship of organisms.
TI  - Small genes/gene-products in Escherichia coli K-12.
AB  - Forty-two protein spots of observed M(r) 6-15 kDa were resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, stained by Coomassie blue and subjected to Edman microsequencing. All of the proteins could be related back to their encoding open reading frames, thereby vindicating the bioinformatic tools currently utilised in their identification. However, only 14/42 gene-products were expressed as annotated. Translation was confirmed for 14 open reading frames with no attributed function (EcoGene Y-entries), while N-terminal sequence allowed the start codon to be accurately annotated for the genes yigF, yccU, yqiC, ynfD, and yeeX. The methionine start codon was cleaved in 11 gene-products (AtpE, Hns, RpoZ, RplL, CspC, YccJ, YggX, YjgF, HimA, InfA, RpsQ) and a further five showed loss of a signal peptide (PspE, HdeB, HdeA, YnfD, YkfE). Internal (Tig, AtpA, TufA) and N-terminal fragmentation (CspD, RpsF, AtcU) of much larger proteins was also detected, which may have resulted from physiological or translational processes. M(r) and pI isoforms were detected respectively for PtsH and GatB, each being phosphoproteins, as well as RplY which manifested differences with respect to predicted M(r) and pI. In addition, YjgF was shown to belong to a small gene family of unknown function with ancient conserved regions across procaryotes and eucaryotes. YgiN was revealed to have a paralogue and orthologues in Bacillus subtilis, Synechocystis sp., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Neisseria gonorrhoea, and Rhodococcus erythropolis. Orthologues are also reported for YihD, YccU and YeeX. Of the 14 Y-genes, only YkfE possessed no detectable orthologues. These results highlight the need to complement genomic analysis with detailed proteomics in order to gain a better understanding of cellular molecular biology, while the confirmation of the open reading frame start codon using Edman degradation protein microsequencing has yet to be superseded by recent advances in mass spectrometry.
TI  - The serine, threonine, and/or tyrosine-specific protein kinases and protein phosphatases of prokaryotic organisms: a family portrait.
AB  - Inspection of the genomes for the bacteria Bacillus subtilis 168, Borrelia burgdorferi B31, Escherichia coli K-12, Haemophilus influenzae KW20, Helicobacter pylori 26695, Mycoplasma genitalium G-37, and Synechocystis sp PCC 6803 and for the archaeons Archaeoglobus fulgidus VC-16 DSM4304, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum delta H, and Methanococcus jannaschii DSM2661 revealed that each contains at least one ORF whose predicted product displays sequence features characteristic of eukaryote-like protein-serine/threonine/tyrosine kinases and protein-serine/threonine/tyrosine phosphatases. Orthologs for all four major protein phosphatase families (PPP, PPM, conventional PTP, and low molecular weight PTP) were present in the bacteria surveyed, but not all strains contained all types. The three archaeons surveyed lacked recognizable homologs of the PPM family of eukaryotic protein-serine/threonine phosphatases; and only two prokaryotes were found to contain ORFs for potential phosphatases from all four major families. Intriguingly, our searches revealed a potential ancestral link between the catalytic subunits of microbial arsenate reductases and the protein-tyrosine phosphatases; they share similar ligands (arsenate versus phosphate) and features of their catalytic mechanism (formation of arseno-versus phospho-cysteinyl intermediates). It appears that all prokaryotic organisms, at one time, contained the genetic information necessary to construct protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation networks that target serine, threonine, and/or tyrosine residues on proteins. However, the potential for functional redundancy among the four protein phosphatase families has led many prokaryotic organisms to discard one, two, or three of the four.
TI  - Community-acquired septicaemia in southern Viet Nam: the importance of multidrug-resistant Salmonella typhi.
AB  - In a prospective study conducted between mid 1993 and 1994, 437 adults and children were admitted with community-acquired septicaemia to an infectious diseases hospital in southern Viet Nam. Gram-negative aerobes accounted for 90% of isolates and were predominantly Salmonella typhi (67%), Sal. para-typhi A (3%), Escherichia coli (10%), and Klebsiella spp. (5%). Other Salmonella spp. (1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1%), Neisseria meningitidis (0.5%) and Haemophilus influenzae (0.2%) were uncommon. Staphylococcus aureus (5.5%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (2%) were the most common Gram-positive isolates. Patients with enteric fever were younger (median age 16 years, range 1-63) than the other patients (median age 43 years, range 1-88) (P < 0.001) and had a lower mortality rate (0.3% vs. 23%; relative risk 69.5, 95% confidence interval 9.5-507.8; P < 0.0001). Over 70% of the Sal. typhi isolated were multi-drug-resistant, and 4% were resistant to nalidixic acid. Multidrug-resistant Sal. typhi is a major cause of community-acquired septicaemia in Viet Nam.
TI  - [The impact of bronchial colonization in the quality of life of patients with chronic, stable bronchitis].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the impact of respiratory function and bacterial colonization of the lower airway on the quality of life of patients with chronic, stable bronchitis (CB). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A series of 41 patients with stable CB was studied (age: 63.8; standard deviation (SD) 9.1 years; FVC% 91.0 (18.9); FEV1% 74.6 (23.7); FEV1/FEC 62.8 (11.2) with normal thoracic radiography. Patients with previous diagnosis of bronchiectasia, bronchial asthma and/or positive bronchodilatory tests (> 15%) were not included in the study. Bacterial growth in a sputum sample of grade 4-5 of the Murray-Washington scale was considered diagnostic of bronchial colonization. Measurement of the quality of life was performed with the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) and the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). RESULTS: The patients presented a moderate alteration in their quality of life with scores over 25 in most of the dimensions of the NHP and the SGRQ. In 9 out of 41 cases (22%), the sputum cultures demonstrated bronchial colonization with the most frequently isolated bacterias being Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Multivariate analysis performed with the quality of life as the dependent variable showed an association between FEV1/FEC1 and the SGRQ score (R2 = 0.18), and energy (R2 = 0.09) and physical mobility (R2 = 0.05) of NHP. CONCLUSIONS: Bronchial obstruction is the main determinant in the quality of life in patients with stable CB. Colonization of the lower airway is observed in 22% of the patients and also influences the quality of life of the patients but to a much lesser extent.
TI  - Secondary structure and molecular analysis of interstrain variability in the P5 outer-membrane protein of non-typable Haemophilus influenzae isolated from diverse anatomical sites.
AB  - The sequence of the non-typable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) P5 outer-membrane protein from a range of clinical isolates is presented and represents the first analysis of the heterogeneity in P5 from NTHi isolates from diverse anatomical sites. The basis of the previously observed inter-strain variation in the electrophoretic mobility is attributed to heterogeneity in three hypervariable regions. Alignment of the P5 sequences identified regions which are highly conserved and align with the transmembrane region predicted for the homologous Escherichia coli protein, OmpA. Variable regions correspond to surface-exposed loops, of which the first loop falls into subclasses. However, these subclasses fail to correlate with anatomical predisposition. Although P5 has been proposed as a fimbrial protein composed of coiled coils, both structural analysis by circular dichroism of purified P5 and computer analysis of the multiply aligned sequences predict a high proportion of beta strand with no evidence of coiled coil structure. A detailed model of P5 is presented.
TI  - Patterns of protein-fold usage in eight microbial genomes: a comprehensive structural census.
AB  - Eight microbial genomes are compared in terms of protein structure. Specifically, yeast, H. influenzae, M. genitalium, M. jannaschii, Synechocystis, M. pneumoniae, H. pylori, and E. coli are compared in terms of patterns of fold usage-whether a given fold occurs in a particular organism. Of the approximately 340 soluble protein folds currently in the structure databank (PDB), 240 occur in at least one of the eight genomes, and 30 are shared amongst all eight. The shared folds are depleted in allhelical structure and enriched in mixed helix-sheet structure compared to the folds in the PDB. The top-10 most common of the shared 30 are enriched in superfolds, uniting many non-homologous sequence families, and are especially similar in overall architecture-eight having helices packed onto a central sheet. They are also very different from the common folds in the PBD, highlighting databank biases. Folds can be ranked in terms of expression as well as genome duplication. In yeast the top-10 most highly expressed folds are considerably different from the most highly duplicated folds. A tree can be constructed grouping genomes in terms of their shared folds. This has a remarkably similar topology to more conventional classifications, based on very different measures of relatedness. Finally, folds of membrane proteins can be analyzed through transmembrane-helix (TM) prediction. All the genomes appear to have similar usage patterns for these folds, with the occurrence of a particular fold falling off rapidly with increasing numbers of TM-elements, according to a "Zipf-like" law. This implies there are no marked preferences for proteins with particular numbers of TM-helices (e.g. 7-TM) in microbial genomes.
TI  - An ampD gene in Pseudomonas aeruginosa encodes a negative regulator of AmpC beta-lactamase expression.
AB  - The ampD and ampE genes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 were cloned and characterized. These genes are transcribed in the same orientation and form an operon. The deduced polypeptide of P. aeruginosa ampD exhibited more than 60% similarity to the AmpD proteins of enterobacteria and Haemophilus influenzae. The ampD product transcomplemented Escherichia coli ampD mutants to wild-type beta-lactamase expression.
TI  - A family of stability determinants in pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - A novel segregational stability system was identified on plasmid R485, which originates from Morganella morganii. The system is composed of two overlapping genes, stbD and stbE, which potentially encode proteins of 83 and 93 amino acids, respectively. Homologs of the stbDE genes were identified on the enterotoxigenic plasmid P307 from Escherichia coli and on the chromosomes of Vibrio cholerae and Haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegyptius. The former two homologs also promote plasmid stability in E. coli. Furthermore, the stbDE genes share homology with components of the relBEF operon and with the dnaT gene of E. coli. The organization of the stbDE cassette is reminiscent of toxin-antitoxin stability cassettes.
TI  - Prediction by a neural network of outer membrane beta-strand protein topology.
AB  - An artificial neural network (NN) was trained to predict the topology of bacterial outer membrane (OM) beta-strand proteins. Specifically, the NN predicts the z-coordinate of Calpha atoms in a coordinate frame with the outer membrane in the xy-plane, such that low z-values indicate periplasmic turns, medium z-values indicate transmembrane beta-strands, and high z-values indicate extracellular loops. To obtain a training set, seven OM proteins (porins) with structures known to high resolution were aligned with their pores along the z-axis. The relationship between Calpha z-values and topology was thereby established. To predict the topology of other OM proteins, all seven porins were used for the training set. Z-values (topologies) were predicted for two porins with hitherto unknown structure and for OM proteins not belonging to the porin family, all with insignificant sequence homology to the training set. The results of topology prediction compare favorably with experimental topology data.
TI  - Analysis of complete genomes suggests that many prokaryotes do not rely on hairpin formation in transcription termination.
AB  - Free energy values of mRNA tertiary structures around stop codons were systematically calculated to surmise the hairpin-forming potential for all genes in each of the 16 complete prokaryote genomes. Instead of trying to detect each individual hairpin, we averaged the free energy values around the stop codons over the entire genome to predict how extensively the organism relies on hairpin formation in the process of transcription termination. The free energy values of Escherichia coli K-12 shows a sharp drop, as expected, at 30 bp downstream of the stop codon, presumably due to hairpin-forming sequences. Similar drops are observed for Haemophilus influenzae Rd, Bacillus subtilis and Chlamydia trachomatis, suggesting that these organisms also form hairpins at their transcription termination sites. On the other hand, 12 other prokaryotes- Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Synechocystis PCC6803, Helicobacter pylori, Borrelia burgdorferi, Methanococcus jannaschii, Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, Aquifex aeolicus, Pyrococcus horikoshii, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Treponema pallidum -show no apparent decrease in free energy value at the corresponding regions. This result suggests that these prokaryotes, or at least some of them, may never form hairpins at their transcription termination sites.
TI  - A gene cluster encoding malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MatA), malonyl-CoA synthetase  (MatB) and a putative dicarboxylate carrier protein (MatC) in Rhizobium trifolii--cloning, sequencing, and expression of the enzymes in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A gene cluster consisting of three consecutive genes, matABC, was isolated using  a probe prepared from amino acid sequence information of Rhizobium trifolii malonyl-CoA synthetase, and was subsequently sequenced. The sequences of matA and matB were overlapped by four base pairs, whereas the intergenic region between matB and matC had 95 base pairs. The upstream region contained DNA sequences which are typical for an Escherichia coli sigma70 promoter, and no other open reading frame was found within 400 bp downstream of matC. The ribosome-binding sites were found 7 to 12 base pairs upstream of each gene. MatA gene encoded a polypeptide of 462 amino acid residues, with deduced molecular mass of 51414 Da. A glutathione-S-transferase-MatA fusion protein has been purified and MatA was shown to have an intrinsic malonyl-CoA decarboxylase activity (Km = 0.47 mM; Vmax = 52 micromol x min(-1) x mg(-1)). MatB encoded a polypeptide of 504 amino acid residues with deduced molecular mass of 54612 Da. MatB was also purified from E. coli transformant carrying the gene cluster. The enzyme was essentially indistinguishable from the wild-type malonyl-CoA synthetase of R. trifolii by the criteria of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and biochemical properties. MatC encoded a 46453-Da protein with a high content of hydrophobic residues. The deduced amino acid sequences of matC showed identity to some extent with anaerobic C4-dicarboxylate carrier proteins from E. coli (25%) and Haemophilus influenzae (17%). MatC protein appears to be an integral membrane protein that could function as a malonate carrier. The formation of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA from malonate was confirmed by thin-layer chromatographic analysis. These results strongly suggest that the gene cluster encodes proteins involved in the malonate-metabolizing system, malonate-->malonyl-CoA-->acetyl-CoA, in R. trifolii and that the metabolic pathway in the malonate-rich clover nodule might play an important role in symbiosis.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the fis operon in enteric bacteria.
AB  - The small DNA binding protein Fis is involved in several different biological processes in Escherichia coli. It has been shown to stimulate DNA inversion reactions mediated by the Hin family of recombinases, stimulate integration and excision of phage lambda genome, regulate the transcription of several different genes including those of stable RNA operons, and regulate the initiation of DNA replication at oriC. fis has also been isolated from Salmonella typhimurium, and the genomic sequence of Haemophilus influenzae reveals its presence in this bacteria. This work extends the characterization of fis to other organisms. Very similar fis operon structures were identified in the enteric bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Erwinia carotovora, and Proteus vulgaris but not in several nonenteric bacteria. We found that the deduced amino acid sequences for Fis are 100% identical in K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, E. coli, and S. typhimurium and 96 to 98% identical when E. carotovora and P. vulgaris Fis are considered. The deduced amino acid sequence for H. influenzae Fis is about 80% identical and 90% similar to Fis in enteric bacteria. However, in spite of these similarities, the E. carotovora, P. vulgaris, and H. influenzae Fis proteins are not functionally identical. An open reading frame (ORF1) preceding fis in E. coli is also found in all these bacteria, and their deduced amino acid sequences are also very similar. The sequence preceding ORF1 in the enteric bacteria showed a very strong similarity to the E. coli fis P region from -53 to +27 and the region around -116 containing an ihf binding site. Both beta-galactosidase assays and primer extension assays showed that these regions function as promoters in vivo and are subject to growth phase-dependent regulation. However, their promoter strengths vary, as do their responses to Fis autoregulation and integration host factor stimulation.
TI  - [A national multicenter study of the in-vitro activity of piperacillin-tazobactam. The Spanish Piperacillin-Tazobactam Group].
AB  - The action of piperacillin-tazobactam on 4,137 of the 4,364 strains collected in  a Spanish multicenter study involving 46 participating hospitals was studied. The samples were from the following: 41% urine, 18% exuded from wound abscesses, 13% respiratory, 9% blood, 3% peritoneal liquid, and the remainder from other various sources. The gram-negative bacteria included 2,778 strains from 13 genera: Escherichia (1,289), Pseudomonas (451), Proteus (230), Klebsiella (203), Haemophilus (172), Enterobacter (145), Acinetobacter (88), Salmonella (60), Bacteroides (57), Morganella (53), Serratia (46), Citrobacter (46), Stenotrophonomas (23) and Moraxella (21). The gram-positive bacteria were S. aureus (316), E. faecalis (239), S. epidermis (130), S. pneumoniae (115) and Clostridium spp. (12). The global susceptibility of the gram-negatives to piperacillin-tazobactam was 94%: E. coli 98%, P. aeruginosa 92%, and P. mirabilis, Morganella, K. pneumoniae, Serratia and Salmonella spp. all greater than 94%. The susceptibility of other bacteria was as follows: 91% Citrobacter, 77% E. cloacae, 42% A. baumannii, 61% S. maltophilia, 97% E. faecalis, 93% S. epidermidis, 100% M. catarrhalis, 99% H. influenzae and 100% anaerobic bacteria. The action on S. pneumoniae and S. aureus varied according to the susceptibility or lack there of to penicillin or methicillin. In comparison to other antibiotics (piperacillin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem and ciprofloxacin), piperacillin-tazobactam was far better than piperacillin alone and better or similar to the others.
TI  - Sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  - The microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. Anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). There were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and 12 anaerobic. The predominant aerobic isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). The predominant anaerobes were Prevotella sp. (5), Peptostreptococcus sp. (4), Fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and Bacteroides fragilis (1). Beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. Organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven instances. This study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.
TI  - Epidemiologic study of bacterial meningitis in Jakarta and Tangerang: preliminary report.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the cause of bacterial meningitis in children >1 month of  age and <5 years of age in several hospitals in Jakarta and Tangerang, Indonesia. METHODS: Hospital-based, prospective surveillance study of 100 subjects between 1 month and 5 years of age. Subjects meeting inclusion criteria were evaluated for clinical and laboratory findings of bacterial meningitis. RESULTS: Of 16 subjects enrolled thus far, 11 have been diagnosed as bacterial meningitis. Of these 11, 6 had positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures (2 with Haemophilus influenzae and one each with Neisseria meningitidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella ozaenae and Escherichia coli). Three of the 6 had positive latex agglutination tests (LAT; 2 H. influenzae and 1 N. meningitidis); LAT was negative for all 10 with negative CSF culture. CSF Gram-stained smear was positive only for the subject with E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: The number of children admitted with bacterial meningitis has been declining, perhaps because of early treatment with antibiotics in the community. Of culture-positive cases 33% have been caused by H. influenzae, but this result is based on few patients thus far. LAT has correlated well with culture, whereas Gram stain has had low sensitivity, perhaps reflecting deficiencies in technique.
TI  - Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharides-protein conjugate vaccine elicits a more diverse antibody repertoire in infants than in adults.
AB  - Conjugation of bacterial polysaccharides (PS) to protein carriers confers the ability to elicit protective serum Ab in infants, who respond poorly to plain PS. The serum Ab of young children immunized with Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) PS conjugate vaccine varies with age and Ag formulation. To understand these age-related changes in human anti-Hib PS immune responses we determined the variable region gene sequences encoding anti-Hib PS mAbs of infants immunized with Hib oligosaccharide-diphtheria toxin vaccine. The anti-Hib PS repertoire of children differs from that of adults. A smaller proportion of mAbs from children have high affinity for Hib PS, and the overall variable region gene repertoire of infants is more diverse than that in adults. Variable region genes encoding high affinity mAbs of infants are similar to the restricted repertoire described in adults. Low affinity anti-Hib PS mAbs of infants are encoded by a heterogeneous group of genes that are uncommonly observed in the adult repertoire. Abs with high affinity for Hib PS from infants, like most mAbs from adults, react only with Hib PS and the structurally similar PS of Escherichia coli K100, whereas low affinity mAbs of infants are polyreactive. The low affinity anti-Hib PS mAbs of infants immunized with Hib oligosaccharide-diphtheria toxin vaccine vaccine are not reflected in serum Ab. However, the differences between the variable region gene repertoires of adults and infants may account for the distinct immunologic characteristics of the anti-Hib PS responses in young children immunized with other vaccine formulations.
TI  - Natural genetic exchange between Haemophilus and Neisseria: intergeneric transfer of chromosomal genes between major human pathogens.
AB  - Members of the bacterial families Haemophilus and Neisseria, important human pathogens that commonly colonize the nasopharynx, are naturally competent for DNA uptake from their environment. In each genus this process is discriminant in favor of its own and against foreign DNA through sequence specificity of DNA receptors. The Haemophilus DNA uptake apparatus binds a 29-bp oligonucleotide domain containing a highly conserved 9-bp core sequence, whereas the neisserial apparatus binds a 10-bp motif. Each motif ("uptake sequence", US) is highly over-represented in the chromosome of the corresponding genus, particularly concentrated with core sequences in inverted pairs forming gene terminators. Two Haemophilus core USs were unexpectedly found forming the terminator of sodC in Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus), and sequence analysis strongly suggests that this virulence gene, located next to IS1106, arose through horizontal transfer from Haemophilus. By using USs as search strings in a computer-based analysis of genome sequence, it was established that while USs of the "wrong" genus do not occur commonly in Neisseria or Haemophilus, where they do they are highly likely to flag domains of chromosomal DNA that have been transferred from Haemophilus. Three independent domains of Haemophilus-like DNA were found in the meningococcal chromosome, associated respectively with the virulence gene sodC, the bio gene cluster, and an unidentified orf. This report identifies intergenerically transferred DNA and its source in bacteria, and further identifies transformation with heterologous chromosomal DNA as a way of establishing potentially important chromosomal mosaicism in these pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - The Escherichia coli relBE genes belong to a new toxin-antitoxin gene family.
AB  - Toxin-antitoxin systems are defined as a group of plasmid- and chromosome-encoded loci that specify a cell toxin and a protein antitoxin. Plasmid-encoded toxin-antitoxin systems stabilize their replicons by killing plasmid-free cells. Here, we show that the relBE genes of Escherichia coli K-12 have all the basic features previously connected with toxin-antitoxin systems: (i) relE encodes a cytotoxin lethal or inhibitory to host cells; (ii) relB encodes an antitoxin that prevents the lethal action of the relE-encoded toxin; (iii) the relBE genes stabilize a mini-R1 test plasmid; and (iv) the RelB antitoxin autoregulates the relBEF operon at the level of transcription. Using database searching, we found relBE homologues on the chromosomes of E. coli K-12, Haemophilus influenzae and Vibrio cholerae. A fifth relBE homologue was identified on the enterotoxin encoding E. coli plasmid P307. Indirect evidence suggests that the toxicity of RelE may be related to the inhibition of protein synthesis. Based on these observations, we propose a model that explains the delayed relaxed phenotype associated with mutations in relB.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on tazobactam/piperacillin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies on tazobactam/piperacillin (TAZ/PIPC), a combination drug of piperacillin (PIPC) with the new beta-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam (TAZ), were carried out in the field of pediatrics. 1. After intravenous administration of TAZ/PIPC at a dose of 25 mg/kg to one child, the peak plasma levels of TAZ and PIPC were 24.4 micrograms/ml and 119 micrograms/ml respectively after 5 min. The half-lives of TAZ and PIPC were 0.48 and 0.60 hours respectively. Same as 50 mg/kg to two children, the peak plasma levels of TAZ and PIPC were 17.5, 32.2 micrograms/ml and 92.8, 163 micrograms/ml after 5 min. The half-lives of TAZ and PIPC were 0.37, 0.50 hours and 0.51, 0.59 hours. A ratio of TAZ to PIPC was about 1 to 4 in plasma levels. The cumulative urinary recovery rates of TAZ and PIPC in the first 6 hours after intravenous administration were 15.8, 64.9% and 39.8, 53.4%. 2. The antibacterial activity of TAZ/PIPC against clinically isolated organisms was determined. The MICs of TAZ/PIPC were < or = 0.05 microgram/ml against Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae and > or = 1.56 micrograms/ml against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. 3. The clinical efficacy of TAZ/PIPC could be evaluated in 14 patients with various bacterial infections, and was evaluated as "excellent" in 9 patients and as "good" in 5. The overall clinical efficacy rate in 14 cases was 100% and excellent was 64.3%. Bacteriological efficacy rate was 91.7% (10/11). 4. As a side effect, loose stool was observed in one case, no abnormal laboratory test values were observed. It has been concluded that TAZ/PIPC was a useful drug in the field of pediatrics.
TI  - hgpB, a gene encoding a second Haemophilus influenzae hemoglobin- and hemoglobin-haptoglobin-binding protein.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae requires heme for growth and can utilize both hemoglobin and hemoglobin-haptoglobin as heme sources. We previously identified a hemoglobin- and hemoglobin-haptoglobin-binding protein, HgpA, in H. influenzae HI689. Mutation of hgpA did not affect binding or utilization of either heme source. The hgpA mutant exhibited loss of a 120-kDa protein and increased expression of a 115-kDa protein. These data suggested that at least one other gene product is involved in binding of these heme sources by H. influenzae. A 3.2-kbp PCR product derived from HI689 was cloned. The nucleotide sequence indicated a separate, distinct gene with high homology to hgpA, which would encode a 115-kDa protein. Primers were designed for directional cloning of the structural gene in the correct reading frame. Sonicates of induced Escherichia coli harboring the cloned open reading frame bound both hemoglobin and hemoglobin-haptoglobin. An insertion/deletion mutant of H. influenzae at the newly identified locus, designated hgpB, was constructed. The 115-kDa protein was not detected in the mutant after affinity purification using biotinylated hemoglobin. An hgpA hgpB double-mutant strain exhibited a reduced ability to utilize hemoglobin-haptoglobin, although it was unaltered in the ability to utilize hemoglobin. Affinity isolation of hemoglobin-binding proteins from the double mutant resulted in isolation of an approximately 120-kDa protein. Internal peptide sequencing revealed this protein to be a third distinct protein, highly homologous to HgpA and HgpB. In summary a second hemoglobin- and hemoglobin-haptoglobin-binding protein of H. influenzae has been identified and characterized, and the presence of an additional protein of similar function has been revealed.
TI  - A genome-based approach for the identification of essential bacterial genes.
AB  - We have used comparative genomics to identify 26 Escherichia coli open reading frames that are both of unknown function (hypothetical open reading frames or y-genes) and conserved in the compact genome of Mycoplasma genitalium. Not surprisingly, these genes are broadly conserved in the bacterial world. We used a markerless knockout strategy to screen for essential E. coli genes. To verify this phenotype, we constructed conditional mutants in genes for which no null mutants could be obtained. In total we identified six genes that are essential for E. coli (yhbZ, ygjD, ycfB, yfil, yihA, and yjeQ). The respective orthologs of the genes yhbZ, ygjD, ycfB, yjeQ, and yihA are also essential in Bacillus subtilis. This low number of essential genes was unexpected and might be due to a characteristic of the versatile genomes of E. coli and B. subtilis that is comparable to the phenomenon of nonorthologous gene displacement. The gene ygjD, encoding a sialoglycoprotease, was eliminated from a minimal genome computationally derived from a comparison of the Haemophilus influenzae and M. genitalium genomes. We show that ygjD and its ortholog ydiE are essential in E. coli and B. subtilis, respectively. Thus, we include this gene in a minimal genome. This study systematically integrates comparative genomics and targeted gene disruptions to identify broadly conserved bacterial genes of unknown function required for survival on complex media.
TI  - Evolution of the structure and chromosomal distribution of histidine biosynthetic genes.
AB  - A database of more than 100 histidine biosynthetic genes from different organisms belonging to the three primary domains has been analyzed, including those found in the now completely sequenced genomes of Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Synechocystis sp., Methanococcus jannaschii, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The ubiquity of his genes suggests that it is a highly conserved pathway that was probably already present in the last common ancestor of all extant life. The chromosomal distribution of the his genes shows that the enterobacterial histidine operon structure is not the only possible organization, and that there is a diversity of gene arrays for the his pathway. Analysis of the available sequences shows that gene fusions (like those involved in the origin of the Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium hisIE and hisB gene structures) are not universal. In contrast, the elongation event that led to the extant hisA gene from two homologous ancestral modules, as well as the subsequent paralogous duplication that originated hisF, appear to be irreversible and are conserved in all known organisms. The available evidence supports the hypothesis that histidine biosynthesis was assembled by a gene recruitment process.
TI  - Strategies towards a better understanding of antibiotic action: folate pathway inhibition in Haemophilus influenzae as an example.
AB  - Two-dimensional electrophoresis was applied to the global analysis of the cellular response of Haemophilus influenzae to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, both inhibitors of tetrahydrofolate synthesis. Deregulation of the synthesis rate of 118 proteins, involved in different metabolic pathways, was observed. The regulation of the genes involved in the metabolism of the amino acids methionine, threonine, serine, glycine, and aspartate was investigated in detail by analysis of protein synthesis and Northern hybridization. The results suggested that the synthesis of methionine biosynthetic enzymes in H. influenzae is regulated in a similar fashion as in Escherichia coli. A good correlation between the results obtained by Northern hybridization and quantification of protein synthesis was observed. In contrast to trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole triggered the increased synthesis of the heat shock proteins DnaK, GroEL, and GroES.
TI  - Evolution of new protein function: recombinational enhancer Fis originated by horizontal gene transfer from the transcriptional regulator NtrC.
AB  - New protein function is thought to evolve mostly by gene duplication and divergence. Here we present phylogenetic evidence that the multifunctional protein Fis of the gamma proteobacterial species derived from the COOH-terminal domain of an ancestral alpha proteobacterial NtrC transcriptional regulatory protein. All of the known enterobacterial fis genes are preceded by an open reading frame, named yhdG, that is highly similar to nifR3, a gene that forms an operon with ntrC in several alpha proteobacterial species. Thus, we propose that yhdG and fis were acquired by a lineage ancestral to the gamma proteobacteria in a single horizontal gene transfer event, and later diverged to their present functions.
TI  - Interactions of plaunotol with bacterial membranes.
AB  - Plaunotol, a cytoprotective antiulcer agent, has a bactericidal effect against Helicobacter pylori, which may result from interaction of this compound with the bacterial cell membrane. The purpose of the present study was to confirm that plaunotol interacts with the H. pylori membrane. Membrane fluidities were measured using two stearic acid spin labels, namely 5-doxyl-stearic acid (in which the nitroxide group is located in the upper portion of the bacterial cell membrane) and 16-doxyl-stearic acid methyl ester (in which the nitroxide group is located deeper in the bacterial cell membrane), by means of electron spin resonance. The membrane fluidities of plaunotol-treated cells were significantly increased in the measurements made using the two spin labels. We also attempted to isolate plaunotol-resistant H. pylori in vitro by two different methods. To assess the level of resistance that could be reached, H. pylori was passaged five times on an agar plate containing subinhibitory concentrations of plaunotol or metronidazole. To measure the rate of development of resistance, H. pylori was grown with subinhibitory concentrations (0.25 x MIC) of plaunotol or metronidazole, and quantitatively plated on to medium containing 4 x MIC of the compounds. This treatment was repeated once more. No plaunotol-resistant colonies were selected by the two methods. H. pylori developed resistance to metronidazole easily and at a relatively high rate. The mechanism by which plaunotol directly fluidizes and destroys the H. pylori membrane might make it difficult for this organism to develop resistance to plaunotol. It was confirmed that the bactericidal effects of plaunotol were also shown against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae. No such effect was seen against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Correlation of chi orientation with transcription indicates a fundamental relationship between recombination and transcription.
AB  - Cross-over hot-spot instigator (Chi) sequences (5'-GCTGGTGG-3') are abundant, strand-specific, sequences, which locally increase recombination in Escherichia coli. Located within G-rich 'recombination islands', Chi orientations correlate with the orientations both of DNA replication and of transcription. Consistent with evidence from eukaryotic systems for a fundamental relationship between recombination and transcription, we find for E. coli Chi sequences, and for Haemophilus influenzae Chi-like sequences, that orientations correlate better with transcription than with replication. Complying with Szybalski's transcription direction rule, open reading frames in these prokaryotes have purine-rich mRNA-synonymous DNA strands. Hence, the G-richness of 'recombination islands' may reflect their correspondence with 'transcriptional islands' (genes). Comparison of a natural with the corresponding shuffled sequence, indicates a base order-dependent island unit of approx. 1kb. 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.
TI  - A 3',5' cyclic AMP (cAMP) phosphodiesterase modulates cAMP levels and optimizes competence in Haemophilus influenzae Rd.
AB  - Changes in intracellular 3',5' cyclic AMP (cAMP) concentration regulate the development of natural competence in Haemophilus influenzae. In Escherichia coli, cAMP levels are modulated by a cAMP phosphodiesterase encoded by the cpdA gene. We have used several approaches to demonstrate that the homologous icc gene of H. influenzae encodes a functional cAMP phosphodiesterase and that this gene limits intracellular cAMP and thereby influences competence and other cAMP-dependent processes. In E. coli, expression of cloned icc reduced both cAMP-dependent sugar fermentation and beta-galactosidase expression, as has been shown for cpdA. In H. influenzae, an icc null mutation increased cAMP-dependent sugar fermentation and competence development in strains where these processes are limited by mutations reducing cAMP synthesis. When endogenous production of cAMP was eliminated by a cya mutation, an icc strain was 10,000-fold more sensitive to exogenous cAMP than an icc+ strain. The icc strain showed moderately elevated competence under noninducing conditions, as expected, but had subnormal competence increases at onset of stationary phase in rich medium, and on transfer to a nutrient-limited medium, suggesting that excessive cAMP may interfere with induction. Consistent with this finding, a cya strain cultured in 1 mM cAMP failed to develop maximal competence on transfer to inducing conditions. Thus, by limiting cAMP levels, the H. influenzae cAMP phosphodiesterase may coordinate its responses to nutritional stress, ensuring optimal competence development.
TI  - Codon usage in highly expressed genes of Haemophillus influenzae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis: translational selection versus mutational bias.
AB  - Biases in the codon usage and base compositions at three codon sites in different genes of A+T-rich Gram-negative bacterium Haemophillus influenzae and G+C-rich Gram-positive bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis have been examined to address the following questions: (1) whether the synonymous codon usage in organisms having highly skewed base compositions is totally dictated by the mutational bias as reported previously (Sharp, P.M., Devine, K.M., 1989. Codon usage and gene expression level in Dictyostelium discoideum: highly expressed genes do 'prefer' optimal codons. Nucleic Acids Res. 17, 5029-5039), or is also controlled by translational selection; (2) whether preference of G in the first codon positions by highly expressed genes, as reported in Escherichia coli (Gutierrez, G., Marquez, L., Marin, A., 1996. Preference for guanosine at first codon position in highly expressed Escherichia coli genes. A relationship with translational efficiency. Nucleic Acids Res. 24, 2525-2527), is true in other bacteria; and (3) whether the usage of bases in three codon positions is species-specific. Result presented here show that even in organisms with high mutational bias, translational selection plays an important role in dictating the synonymous codon usage, though the set of optimal codons is chosen in accordance with the mutational pressure. The frequencies of G-starting codons are positively correlated to the level of expression of genes, as estimated by their Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) values, in M. tuberculosis as well as in H. influenzae in spite of having an A+T-rich genome. The present study on the codon preferences of two organisms with oppositely skewed base compositions thus suggests that the preference of G-starting codons by highly expressed genes might be a general feature of bacteria, irrespective of their overall G+C contents. The ranges of variations in the frequencies of individual bases at the first and second codon positions of genes of both H. influenzae and M. tuberculosis are similar to those of E. coli, implying that though the composition of all three codon positions is governed by a selection-mutation balance, the mutational pressure has little influence in the choice of bases at the first two codon positions, even in organisms with highly biased base compositions.
TI  - Glycerol-3-phosphate transport in Haemophilus influenzae: cloning, sequencing, and transcription analysis of the glpT gene.
AB  - The presence of a functional glpT gene in Haemophilus influenzae could be questioned, since there is only what appears to be a truncated glpT (HI0686, 143 nt in the 5'-end) available in the H. influenzae Rd genome database (Fleischmann et al. , 1995). For cloning of the glpT gene from H. influenzae type b strain Eagan, an isogenic glpT, rec-1 double mutant and a selective medium for detection of the glpT mutant strains were constructed. The recombinant plasmid carrying glpT was able to complement the isogenic glpT mutant to wild-type levels of G3P uptake and permitted growth on a selective medium with G3P as a major carbon source. The nucleotide sequences of the glpT gene were determined both directly from PCR products and from the cloned DNA insert of strain Eagan. An identical 1440 bp open reading frame with 480 deduced amino acids, highly homologous to other bacterial G3P permeases, was identified. A Northern blot analysis showed that the glpT genes in both Eagan and Rd strains were transcribed on a RNA of approximately 1.4 kb in size. Thus, it is likely that HI0686 sequence originates from a mutated glpT clone in Escherichia coli.
TI  - Involvement of the Haemophilus ducreyi gmhA gene product in lipooligosaccharide expression and virulence.
AB  - The lipooligosaccharide (LOS) present in the outer membrane of Haemophilus ducreyi is likely a virulence factor for this sexually transmitted pathogen. An open reading frame in H. ducreyi 35000 was found to encode a predicted protein that had 87% identity with the protein product of the gmhA (isn) gene of Haemophilus influenzae. In H. influenzae type b, inactivation of the gmhA gene caused the synthesis of a significantly truncated LOS which possessed only lipid A and a single 2-keto-3-deoxyoctulosonic acid molecule (A. Preston, D. J. Maskell, A. Johnson, and E. R. Moxon, J. Bacteriol. 178:396-402, 1996). The H. ducreyi gmhA gene was able to complement a gmhA-deficient Escherichia coli strain, a result which confirmed the identity of this gene. When the gmhA gene of H. ducreyi was inactivated by insertion of a cat cartridge, the resultant H. ducreyi gmhA mutant, 35000.252, expressed a LOS that migrated much faster than wild-type LOS in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. When the wild-type H. ducreyi strain and its isogenic gmhA mutant were used in the temperature-dependent rabbit model for dermal lesion production by H. ducreyi, the gmhA mutant was found to be substantially less virulent than the wild-type parent strain. The H. ducreyi gmhA gene was amplified by PCR from the H. ducreyi chromosome and cloned into the pLS88 vector. When the H. ducreyi gmhA gene was present in trans in gmhA mutant 35000.252, expression of the gmhA gene product restored the virulence of this mutant to wild-type levels. These results indicate that the gmhA gene product of H. ducreyi is essential for the expression of wild-type LOS by this pathogen.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of tdhA, a locus encoding a TonB-dependent heme receptor from Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - Haemophilus ducreyi is unable to synthesize heme and must acquire it from its only known host, humans. We cloned and sequenced a gene encoding an outer membrane receptor for heme. It was designated tdhA (for TonB-dependent heme receptor A) since it was related by sequence homology to the family of TonB-dependent receptors. TdhA was strikingly similar to open reading frame HI0113 from the genome of Haemophilus influenzae Rd and also shared homology with five other heme receptors, including HxuC, HemR, HmuR, ChuA, and ShuA, from gram-negative bacteria. An Escherichia coli hemA tonB mutant strongly expressing H. ducreyi tdhA grew on low levels of heme as a source of heme only when an intact H. ducreyi Ton system plasmid was present, formally demonstrating functional TonB dependence. tdhA was expressed poorly in vitro by H. ducreyi and only under conditions of heme limitation. A survey of H. ducreyi revealed that all tested strains but one synthesized small amounts of TdhA in vitro under heme-limiting conditions. Surprisingly, an isogenic mutant of tdhA as well as its parent, 35000, both required the same high levels of heme for growth (50 microgram/ml [77 microM] on agar medium). This result, together with previous findings, suggests that in vitro, the uptake of heme by H. ducreyi is mediated by a TonB- and TdhA-independent mechanism, possibly diffusion.
TI  - The effect of successful contact lens wear on mucosal immunity of the eye.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the effect of contact lens wear on the mucosal defenses of the outer eye against infection. DESIGN: A case-controlled study of daily contact lens wearers in their initial 6 months of contact lens wear. PARTICIPANTS: Contact lens wearers (mean age, 23.1 years; 47 subjects) were compared with age-matched control subjects (mean age, 24.7 years; 44 subjects). INTERVENTION: Outer eye defenses were studied by assay of tear constituents and quantitative conjunctival microbiology. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Antimicrobial activity of tears was studied by assay of total immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgA isotype-specific antibodies reactive with Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, albumin and lysozyme, and the ocular surface microbial load determined using quantitative microbiology of the conjunctival sac. RESULTS: The IgA isotype-specific antibodies reactive with E. coli (P = 0.03) and S. epidermidis (P = 0.068) were lower in contact lens wearers, but antibody:albumin ratios were not significantly different in the two groups. Contact lens wear also had no significant effect on tear IgA, albumin, or lysozyme or its ratios with albumin. Bacterial numbers and colonization rates for coagulase-negative staphylococci were greater in contact lens wearers than in age-matched control subjects. Corynebacterium sp. and non-Enterobacteriaceae (P = 0.007) were isolated more frequently and in greater numbers from contact lens wearers. Colonization rates were increased for Corynebacterium sp., but non-Enterobacteriaceae were transient. In both daily contact lens wearers and age-matched control subjects, most conjunctival flora were transient rather than colonizing, and no subject developed an outer eye infection during the study. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that daily contact lens wear does not significantly alter the mucosal defenses of the outer eye that function to eliminate organisms from the conjunctival sac and prevent outer eye infection.
TI  - A 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase catalyzing the formation of 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate in an alternative nonmevalonate pathway for terpenoid biosynthesis.
AB  - Several eubacteria including Esherichia coli use an alternative nonmevalonate pathway for the biosynthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate instead of the ubiquitous mevalonate pathway. In the alternative pathway, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol or its 4-phosphate, which is proposed to be formed from 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate via intramolecular rearrangement followed by reduction process, is one of the biosynthetic precursors of isopentenyl diphosphate. To clone the gene(s) responsible for synthesis of 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate, we prepared and selected E. coli mutants with an obligatory requirement for 2-C-methylerythritol for growth and survival. All the DNA fragments that complemented the defect in synthesizing 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate of these mutants contained the yaeM gene, which is located at 4.2 min on the chromosomal map of E. coli. The gene product showed significant homologies to hypothetical proteins with unknown functions present in Haemophilus influenzae, Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Helicobacter pyroli, and Bacillus subtilis. The purified recombinant yaeM gene product was overexpressed in E. coli and found to catalyze the formation of 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate from 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate in the presence of NADPH. Replacement of NADPH with NADH decreased the reaction rate to about 1% of the original rate. The enzyme required Mn2+, Co2+, or Mg2+ as well. These data clearly show that the yaeM gene encodes an enzyme, designated 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase, that synthesizes 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate from 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate, in a single step by intramolecular rearrangement and reduction and that this gene is responsible for terpenoid biosynthesis in E. coli.
TI  - Identification of the second attachment site for HP1 and S2 bacteriophages in Haemophilus influenzae genome.
AB  - Presented data demonstrate that both HP1c1 and S2 bacteriophages of Haemophilus influenzae can use two related attB sites on the host chromosome. The first indication comes from the analysis of the whole genome sequence of H. influenzae Rd in which a second region of nucleotide sequence identical with the known attB site was detected. The location of both attB sites agrees with results of earlier field-inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE) analysis of S2 and HP1c1 lysogens of H. influenzae. Functionality of cloned attB sites in the integration process of both phages was confirmed using in vivo integrase-dependent recombination system in Escherichia coli. Presented results seem to extend previously described similarities between S2 and HP1c1 phages.
TI  - Bacterial selenocysteine synthase--structural and functional properties.
AB  - Selenocysteine synthase from Escherichia coli is a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-containing enzyme which catalyses the conversion of seryl-tRNA(Sec) into selenocysteyl-tRNA(Sec). Analysis of amino acid sequences indicated that selenocysteine synthase belongs to the alpha/gamma superfamily of pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent enzymes. To identify the lysine residue carrying the prosthetic group, the genes coding for the selenocysteine synthases from Moorella thermoacetica and Desulfomicrobium baculatum were cloned and sequenced and their derived amino acid sequences were aligned with those from E. coli and Haemophilus influenzae. Three lysine residues were found to be conserved; they were mutated into asparagine and one of them, Lys295, was found to be essential for activity. Proteolytic fragmentation of the E. coli enzyme reduced with borohydride, and mass-spectrometric and sequence analysis of the chromophoric peptide proved that Lys295 was modified. Kinetic analysis of the enzyme showed that thiophosphate served as a substrate leading to cysteyl-tRNA(Sec) synthesis, albeit with a 330-fold lower catalytic efficiency. Selenide and, to a much lesser degree, sulfide could also be used by the enzyme but only at much higher concentrations. These data together with the finding that selenophosphate synthetase is highly specific for selenide indicate that the phosphate moiety of selenophosphate provides selenocysteine synthase with the discrimination specificity against sulfur.
TI  - Expression of iron binding proteins and hemin binding activity in the dental pathogen Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was found to express a polypeptide immunologically related to the Neisseria gonorrhoeae FbpA iron binding protein. In addition, the expression of hitB and hitC homologs was detected by Northern blot analysis. This periodontal pathogen also expresses a polypeptide homologous to the 31-kDa Haemophilus influenzae protein, which shows amino acid sequence homology with the FimA and YfeA proteins from Streptococcus parasanguis and Yersinia pestis, respectively. Both A. actinomycetemcomitans protein homologs were located within the periplasmic space, and their synthesis was regulated by the iron and hemin concentration of the culture medium. Southern and Western blot analysis together with molecular cloning revealed the presence of a Fur-like repressor, which may control the iron regulation of gene expression in this bacterium. Cultivation in the presence of hemin or Congo red revealed the ability of this organism to bind hemin. This binding activity was further confirmed by isolating Escherichia coli DH5 alpha clones that produced red and brown colonies on agar plates containing Congo red and hemin, respectively, after transformation with an A. actinomycetemcomitans gene library.
TI  - Hydrolysis of N-succinyl-L,L-diaminopimelic acid by the Haemophilus influenzae dapE-encoded desuccinylase: metal activation, solvent isotope effects, and kinetic mechanism.
AB  - Hydrolysis of N-succinyl-L,L-diaminopimelic acid by the dapE-encoded desuccinylase is required for the bacterial synthesis of lysine and meso-diaminopimelic acid. We have investigated the catalytic mechanism of the recombinant enzyme from Haemophilus influenzae. The desuccinylase was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. Steady-state kinetic experiments verified that the enzyme is metal-dependent, with a Km for N-succinyl-L,L-diaminopimelic acid of 1.3 mM and a turnover number of 200 s-1 in the presence of zinc. The maximal velocity was independent of pH above 7 but decreased with a slope of 1 below pH 7. The pH dependence of V/K was bell-shaped with apparent pKs of 6.5 and 8.3. Both L,L- and D,L-diaminopimelic acid were competitive inhibitors of the substrate, but d,d-diaminopimelic acid was not. Solvent kinetic isotope effect studies yielded inverse isotope effects, with values for D2OV/K of 0.62 and D2OV of 0.78. Determination of metal stoichiometry by ICP-AES indicated one tightly bound metal ion, while sequence homologies suggest the presence of two metal binding sites. On the basis of these observations, we propose a chemical mechanism for this metalloenzyme, which has a number of important structurally defined homologues.
TI  - Cefaclor: a contemporary look at susceptibility of key pathogens from around the  globe.
AB  - The orally administered cephalosporin antibiotic, cefaclor, has been available for clinical use in many countries since 1979. Because widespread antibiotic use is often cited as a factor in the emergence of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, we sought to determine the degrees of resistance to cefaclor expressed by key pathogens recently isolated in 10 countries widely distributed around the world. Using the E-test, minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined for cefaclor and several comparator antibiotics against approximately 700 fresh clinical isolates of each of six bacterial species. The results demonstrated that > 90% of Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase producing and non-producing), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (beta-lactamase producing and non-producing), Moraxella catarrhalis (> 90% beta-lactamase producing), and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and 85% of Escherichia coli were susceptible to cefaclor at the NCCLS interpretive breakpoints. MIC distributions showed that there has been no change in the activity of cefaclor against penicillin-susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae since 1977.
TI  - Physical and genetic maps of the Leptospira interrogans serovar icterohaemorrhagiae strain Ictero no.1 chromosome and sequencing of a 19-kb region of the genome containing the 5S rRNA gene.
AB  - We report the construction of physical and genetic maps of the chromosome of Leptospira interrogans serovar icterohaemorrhagiae strain Ictero No.1 using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of DNA fragments generated by digestion with enzymes SrfI, AscI, FseI, and NotI and using reciprocal hybridization. We also sequenced the 19-kilobase (kb) DNA segment including the one gene for 5S rRNA (rrf) of pathogenic Leptospira. The size of the chromosome of the strain Ictero No.1 was estimated to be 4673kb and was found to be similar to those of the chromosomes of the leptospira strains Verdun (serovar icterohaemorrhagiae) and RZ11 (serovar pomona). The strains Verdun and RZ11 carry a small 350-kb replicon (minichromosome), and the strain Ictero No.1 also contained the same kind of molecule together with the chromosome. The physical maps of the strains Ictero No.1 and Verdun were almost identical, as were the locations of the selected genes, except for the location of one of the 16S rRNA genes. Overall, the genetic organization appeared to be conserved within the serovar icterohaemorrhagiae strains. In the sequenced region, we identified 10 putative ORFs and one rrf sequence, and the transcription orientations were all the same. A homology search for the products deduced from the sequenced data revealed that the orf H exhibited high similarity to malic acid enzyme of Haemophilus influenzae and fumarate hydratase of Escherichia coli (orf J). The rest of the putative products encoded by ORFs in the sequenced region showed little similarity with the proteins contained in the databases and were considered to be unknown proteins.
TI  - Biosynthesis of pteridines in Escherichia coli. Structural and mechanistic similarity of dihydroneopterin-triphosphate epimerase and dihydroneopterin aldolase.
AB  - An open reading frame located at 69.0 kilobases on the Escherichia coli chromosome was shown to code for dihydroneopterin aldolase, catalyzing the conversion of 7,8-dihydroneopterin to 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin in the biosynthetic pathway of tetrahydrofolate. The gene was subsequently designated folB. The FolB protein shows 30% identity to the paralogous dihydroneopterin-triphosphate epimerase, which is specified by the folX gene located at 2427 kilobases on the E. coli chromosome. The folX and folB gene products were both expressed to high yield in recombinant E. coli strains, and the recombinant proteins were purified to homogeneity. Both enzymes form homo-octamers. Aldolase can use L-threo-dihydroneopterin and D-erythro-dihydroneopterin as substrates for the formation of 6-hydroxymethyldihydropterin, but it can also catalyze the epimerization of carbon 2' of dihydroneopterin and dihydromonapterin at appreciable velocity. Epimerase catalyzes the epimerization of carbon 2' in the triphosphates of dihydroneopterin and dihydromonapterin. However, the enzyme can also catalyze the cleavage of the position 6 side chain of several pteridine derivatives at a slow rate. Steady-state kinetic parameters are reported for the various enzyme-catalyzed reactions. We propose that the polarization of the 2'-hydroxy group of the substrate could serve as the initial reaction step for the aldolase as well as for the epimerase activity. A deletion mutant obtained by targeting the folX gene of E. coli has normal growth properties on complete medium as well as on minimal medium. Thus, the physiological role of the E. coli epimerase remains unknown. The open reading frame ygiG of Hemophilus influenzae specifies a protein with the catalytic properties of an aldolase. However, the genome of H. influenzae does not specify a dihydroneopterin-triphosphate epimerase.
TI  - Cytoplasmic membrane lipoprotein LppC of Streptococcus equisimilis functions as an acid phosphatase.
AB  - The function of the streptococcal cytoplasmic membrane lipoprotein, LppC, was identified with isogenic Streptococcus equisimilis H46A and Escherichia coli JM109 strain pairs differing in whether they contained [H46A and JM109(pLPP2)] or lacked (H46A lppC::pLPP10 and JM109) the functional lppC gene for comparative phosphatase determinations under acidic conditions. lppC-directed acid phosphatase activity was demonstrated zymographically and by specific enzymatic activity assays, with whole cells or cell membrane preparations as enzyme sources. LppC acid phosphatase showed optimum activity at pH 5, and the enzyme activity was unaffected by Triton X-100, L-(+)-tartaric acid, or EDTA. Database searches revealed significant structural homology of LppC to the Streptococcus pyogenes LppA, Flavobacterium meningosepticum OplA, Helicobacter pylori HP1285, and Haemophilus influenzae Hel [e (P4)] proteins. These results suggest a possible function for these proteins and establish a novel function of streptococcal cell membrane lipoproteins.
TI  - A 20-kilodalton N-terminal fragment of the D15 protein contains a protective epitope(s) against Haemophilus influenzae type a and type b.
AB  - A conserved 80-kDa minor outer membrane protein, D15, of Haemophilus influenzae has been shown to be a protective antigen in laboratory animals against H. influenzae type a (Hia) or type b (Hib) infection. To localize the protective B-cell epitope(s) within the D15 protein and to further explore the possibility of using synthetic peptides as vaccine antigens, a 20-kDa N-terminal fragment of D15 protein (truncated D15 [tD15]) was expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase in Escherichia coli. The tD15 moiety was cleaved from glutathione S-transferase by using thrombin and purified to homogeneity. The purified soluble tD15 appeared to contain immunodominant protective epitope(s) against Hia and Hib, since rabbit antisera directed against tD15 were capable of protecting infant rats from Hia or Hib bacteremia. The ease of purification of soluble tD15, therefore, makes it a better candidate antigen than the full-length recombinant D15 which is produced as inclusion bodies in E. coli. Furthermore, both the purified tD15 fragment and a mixture of tD15-derived peptides spanning amino acid residues 93 to 209 of the mature D15 protein were capable of inhibiting the protection against Hib conferred on infant rats by rabbit anti-tD15 antiserum, indicating that the protective epitopes of D15 may not be conformational. However, the administration of pooled rabbit immune sera raised against the same panel of peptides failed to protect infant rats from Hib infection.
TI  - Insertion scanning mutagenesis of subunit a of the F1F0 ATP synthase near His245  and implications on gating of the proton channel.
AB  - Subunit a of the E. coli F1F0 ATP synthase was probed by insertion scanning mutagenesis in a region between residues Glu219 and His245. A series of single amino acid insertions, of both alanine and aspartic acid, were constructed after the following residues: 225, 229, 233, 238, 243, and 245. The mutants were tested for growth yield, binding of F1 to membranes, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide sensitivity of ATPase activity, ATP-driven proton translocation, and passive proton permeability of membranes stripped of F1. Significant loss of function was seen only with insertions after positions 238 and 243. In contrast, both insertions after residue 225 and the alanine insertion after residue 245 were nearly identical in function to the wild type. The other insertions showed an intermediate loss of function. Missense mutations of His245 to serine and cysteine were nonfunctional, while the W241C mutant showed nearly normal ATPase function. Replacement of Leu162 by histidine failed to suppress the 245 mutants, but chemical rescue of H245S was partially successful using acetate. An interaction between Trp241 and His245 may be involved in gating a "half-channel" from the periplasmic surface of F0 to Asp61 of subunit a.
TI  - Oligonucleotide bias in Bacillus subtilis: general trends and taxonomic comparisons.
AB  - We present a general analysis of oligonucleotide usage in the complete genome of  Bacillus subtilis . Several datasets were built in order to assign various biological contexts to the biased use of words and to reveal local asymmetries in word usage that may be coupled with replication, the control of gene expression and the restriction/modification system. This analysis was complemented by cross-comparisons with the complete genomes of Escherichia coli , Haemophilus influenzae and Methanococcus jannaschii . We have observed a large number of biased oligonucleotides for words of size up to 8, throughout the datasets and species, indicating that such long strict words play an important role as biological signals. We speculate that some of them are involved in interactions with DNA and/or RNA polymerases. An extensive analysis of palindrome abundances and distributions provides the surprising result that prophage-like elements embedded in the genome exhibit a smaller avoidance of restriction sites. This may reinforce a recently proposed hypothesis of a selfish gene phenomena in the transfer of restriction/modification systems in bacteria.
TI  - Assembly of iron-sulfur clusters. Identification of an iscSUA-hscBA-fdx gene cluster from Azotobacter vinelandii.
AB  - An enzyme having the same L-cysteine desulfurization activity previously described for the NifS protein was purified from a strain of Azotobacter vinelandii deleted for the nifS gene. This protein was designated IscS to indicate its proposed role in iron-sulfur cluster assembly. Like NifS, IscS is a pyridoxal-phosphate containing homodimer. Information gained from microsequencing of oligopeptides obtained by tryptic digestion of purified IscS was used to design a strategy for isolation and DNA sequence analysis of a 7,886-base pair A. vinelandii genomic segment that includes the iscS gene. The iscS gene is contained within a gene cluster that includes homologs to nifU and another gene contained within the major nif cluster of A. vinelandii previously designated orf6. These genes have been designated iscU and iscA, respectively. Information available from complete genome sequences of Escherichia coli and Hemophilus influenzae reveals that they also encode iscSUA gene clusters. A wide conservation of iscSUA genes in nature and evidence that NifU and NifS participate in the mobilization of iron and sulfur for nitrogenase-specific iron-sulfur cluster formation suggest that the products of the iscSUA genes could play a general role in the formation or repair of iron-sulfur clusters. The proposal that IscS is involved in mobilization of sulfur for iron-sulfur cluster formation in A. vinelandii is supported by the presence of a cysE-like homolog in another gene cluster located immediately upstream from the one containing the iscSUA genes. O-Acetylserine synthase is the product of the cysE gene, and it catalyzes the rate-limiting step in cysteine biosynthesis. A similar cysE-like gene is also located within the nif gene cluster of A. vinelandii. The likely role of such cysE-like gene products is to increase the cysteine pool needed for iron-sulfur cluster formation. Another feature of the iscSUA gene cluster region from A. vinelandii is that E. coli genes previously designated as hscB, hscA, and fdx are located immediately downstream from, and are probably co-transcribed with, the iscSUA genes. The hscB, hscA, and fdx genes are also located adjacent to the iscSUA genes in both E. coli and H. influenzae. The E. coli hscA and hscB gene products have previously been shown to bear primary sequence identity when respectively compared with the dnaK and dnaJ gene products and have been proposed to be members of a heat-shock-cognate molecular chaperone system of unknown function. The close proximity and apparent co-expression of iscSUA and hscBA in A. vinelandii indicate that the proposed chaperone function of the hscBA gene products could be related to the maturation of iron-sulfur cluster-containing proteins. Attempts to place non-polar insertion mutations within either A. vinelandii iscS or hscA revealed that such mutations could not be stably maintained in the absence of the corresponding wild-type allele. These results reveal a very strong selective pressure against the maintenance of A. vinelandii iscS or hscA knock-out mutations and suggest that such mutations are either lethal or highly deleterious. In contrast to iscS or hscA, a strain having a polar insertion mutation within the cysE-like gene was readily isolated and could be stably maintained. These results show that the cysE-like gene located upstream from iscS is not essential for cell growth and that the cysE-like gene and the iscSUA-hscBA-fdx genes are contained within separate transcription units.
TI  - Microbial genome analyses: global comparisons of transport capabilities based on  phylogenies, bioenergetics and substrate specificities.
AB  - We have conducted genome sequence analyses of seven prokaryotic microorganisms for which completely sequenced genomes are available (Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Bacillus subtilis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Synechocystis PCC6803 and Methanococcus jannaschii). We report the distribution of encoded known and putative polytopic cytoplasmic membrane transport proteins within these genomes. Transport systems for each organism were classified according to (1) putative membrane topology, (2) protein family, (3) bioenergetics, and (4) substrate specificities. The overall transport capabilities of each organism were thereby estimated. Probable function was assigned to greater than 90% of the putative transport proteins identified. The results show the following: (1) Numbers of transport systems in eubacteria are approximately proportional to genome size and correspond to 9.7 to 10.8% of the total encoded genes except for H. pylori (5.4%), Synechocystis (4.7%) and M. jannaschii (3.5%) which exhibit substantially lower proportions. (2) The distribution of topological types is similar in all seven organisms. (3) Transport systems belonging to 67 families were identified within the genomes of these organisms, and about half of these families are also found in eukaryotes. (4) 12% of these families are found exclusively in Gram-negative bacteria, but none is found exclusively in Gram-positive bacteria, cyanobacteria or archaea. (5) Two superfamilies, the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) and major facilitator (MF) superfamilies account for nearly 50% of all transporters in each organism, but the relative representation of these two transporter types varies over a tenfold range, depending on the organism. (6) Secondary, pmf-dependent carriers are 1.5 to threefold more prevalent than primary ATP-dependent carriers in E. coli, H. influenzae, H. pylori and B. subtilis while primary carriers are about twofold more prevalent in M. genitalium and Synechocystis. M. jannaschii exhibits a slight preference for secondary carriers. (7) Bioenergetics of transport generally correlate with the primary forms of energy generated via available metabolic pathways but ecological niche and substrate availability may also be determining factors. (8) All organisms display a similar range of transport specificities with quantitative differences presumably reflective of disparate ecological niches. (9) M. jannaschii and Synechocystis have a two to threefold increased proportion of transporters for inorganic ions with a concomitant decrease in transporters for organic compounds. (10) 6 to 18% of all transporters in these bacteria probably function as drug export systems showing that these systems are prevalent in non-pathogenic as well as pathogenic organisms. (11) All seven prokaryotes examined encode proteins homologous to known channel proteins, but none of the channel types identified occurs in all of these organisms. (12) The phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system is prevalent in the large genome organisms, E. coli and B. subtilis, and is present in the small genome organisms, H. influenzae and M. genitalium, but is totally lacking in H. pylori, Synechocystis and M. jannaschii. Details of the information summarized in this article are available on our web sites, and this information will be periodically updated and corrected as new sequence and biochemical data become available.
TI  - Differential genome analysis applied to the species-specific features of Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - We introduce a simple and rapid strategy to identify genes that are responsible for species-specific phenotypes. The genome of a species that has a specific phenotype is compared with at least one, closely related, species that lacks this phenotype. Homologous genes that are shared among the species compared are identified and discarded from the list of candidates for species-specific genes. The process is automated and rapidly yields a small subset of the genome that likely contains genes responsible for the species-specific features. Functions are assigned to the genes, and dubious annotations are filtered out. Information is extracted not only from the presence of genes, but also from their absence with respect to known phenotypes. We have applied the technique to identify a set of species-specific genes in Helicobacter pylori by comparing it with its closest relatives for which complete genome sequences are available, Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli. Of the genes of this set for which functional features can be obtained, a large fraction (63%, 123 proteins) is (potentially) involved in H. pylori's interaction with its host. We hypothesize that a family of outer membrane proteins is critical for the ability of H. pylori to colonize host cells in highly acidic environments.
TI  - Comparison of in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms with quinolones and beta-lactam antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against 721 Gram-negative and 498 Gram-positive organisms was determined by the standard microdilution broth method using commercially prepared frozen microtiter plates. The activity of trovafloxacin was compared to ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, ampicillin/sulbactam (1:1), piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, and imipenem. Trovafloxacin had equal or greater activity compared with the other agents tested against Citrobacter diversus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans, group G streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, and E. faecium. The reliability of the commercially prepared plates for testing the in vitro activity of the quinolones was evaluated by comparing identical isolates also tested by broth microdilution using laboratory prepared plates. The commercially prepared plates generally correlated, within one- to twofold dilutions, with the laboratory prepared plates. There was, however, a large discrepancy obtained when testing Enterobacter agglomerans and E. cloacae, where the commercially prepared plates yielded a significantly higher MIC90 value.
TI  - Cloning and expression of Staphylococcus aureus and Treptococcus pyogenes murD genes encoding uridine diphosphate N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine:D-glutamate ligases.
AB  - Bacterial UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanine:D-glutamate ligase (MurD), a cytoplasmic  peptidoglycan biosynthetic enzyme, catalyzes the ATP-dependent addition of D-glutamate to an alanyl residue of the UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanine precursor, generating the dipeptide. The murD gene was cloned from both Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Sequence analysis of the S. aureus murD gene revealed an open reading frame of 449 amino acids. The deduced aa sequence of S. aureus MurD is highly homologous to MurD from Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Bacillus subtilis and St. pyogenes. Recombinant MurD protein from both S. aureus and St. pyogenes was separately overproduced in E. coli and purified as His-tagged fusion. Both recombinant enzymes catalyzed the ATP-dependent addition of D-glutamate to the precursor sugar peptide.
TI  - Expression in Escherichia coli of the putative N-acetylneuraminate lyase gene (nanA) from Haemophilus influenzae: overproduction, purification, and crystallization.
AB  - The cloning and expression of the Haemophilus influenzae gene, nanA, for the putative N-acetylneuraminate lyase enzyme, also known as N-acetylneuraminic acid aldolase or sialic acid aldolase, are reported. The gene was isolated from ATCC type strain 49247 and cloned into the Escherichia coli expression vector pKKtac, which contained the strong tac promoter. Gene expression was compared with the homologous E. coli npl gene coding for the lyase. Purification protocols for the products of the nanA and npl genes are presented. Activity analysis showed that the nanA gene product is a sialic acid aldolase with more than threefold greater specific activity (6.9 IU/mg) than the enzyme from E. coli (</=2 IU/mg). A method for the provision of lyase orthorhombic crystals is reported. These crystals diffract to better than 2.0 A, which paves the way to the solution of the enzyme's three-dimensional structure.
TI  - Reconstruction of amino acid biosynthesis pathways from the complete genome sequence.
AB  - The complete genome sequence of an organism contains information that has not been fully utilized in the current prediction methods of gene functions, which are based on piece-by-piece similarity searches of individual genes. We present here a method that utilizes a higher level information of molecular pathways to reconstruct a complete functional unit from a set of genes. Specifically, a genome-by-genome comparison is first made for identifying enzyme genes and assigning EC numbers, which is followed by the reconstruction of selected portions of the metabolic pathways by use of the reference biochemical knowledge. The completeness of the reconstructed pathway is an indicator of the correctness of the initial gene function assignment. This feature has become possible because of our efforts to computerize the current knowledge of metabolic pathways under the KEGG project. We found that the biosynthesis pathways of all 20 amino acids were completely reconstructed in Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacillus subtilis, and probably in Synechocystis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae as well, although it was necessary to assume wider substrate specificity for aspartate aminotransferases.
TI  - The frequency distribution of gene family sizes in complete genomes.
AB  - We compare the frequency distribution of gene family sizes in the complete genomes of six bacteria (Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Synechocystis sp. PCC6803), two Archaea (Methanococcus jannaschii and Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum), one eukaryote (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), the vaccinia virus, and the bacteriophage T4. The sizes of the gene families versus their frequencies show power-law distributions that tend to become flatter (have a larger exponent) as the number of genes in the genome increases. Power-law distributions generally occur as the limit distribution of a multiplicative stochastic process with a boundary constraint. We discuss various models that can account for a multiplicative process determining the sizes of gene families in the genome. In particular, we argue that, in order to explain the observed distributions, gene families have to behave in a coherent fashion within the genome; i.e., the probabilities of duplications of genes within a gene family are not independent of each other. Likewise, the probabilities of deletions of genes within a gene family are not independent of each other.
TI  - Comparative analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa penicillin-binding protein 7 in the context of its membership in the family of low-molecular-mass PBPs.
AB  - The Pseudomonas aeruginosa pbpG gene encoding penicillin-binding protein 7, a homologue of the Escherichia coli gene encoding a DD-endopeptidase, was cloned and sequenced, pbpG was located immediately downstream of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (phh) operon. DNA sequencing revealed an open reading frame of 936 bp (starting with a GTG codon) which encodes a protein of 34,115 Da. N-terminal amino acid sequencing confirmed the presence of a cleavable N-terminal signal peptide of 23 amino acids. Verification that the protein is a penicillin-binding protein was directly demonstrated by labelling with 125I-labelled penicillin X. Inactivation of P. aeruginosa pbpG by interposon mutagenesis resulted in no obvious phenotypic changes, but when P. aeruginosa PbpG was overexpressed in E. coli using a T7 expression system, cell lysis resulted. P. aeruginosa PbpG resembled E. coli PbpG in being associated with the membrane fraction. Two additional members of the PbpG subfamily were identified in the database. P. aeruginosa PbpG shows 63% identity with E. coli penicillin-binding protein 7 (PbpG) and 60% identity with Vibrio cholerae PbpG, but only 23% identity with Haemophilus influenzae PbpG. The PbpG subfamily and three other subfamilies constituting the low-molecular-mass PBP protein family were analysed by multiple alignment of 26 sequences. PbpG exhibited the consensus motifs of other penicillin-binding proteins. Ten anchor residues were identified that are conserved at the family level within the superfamily of serine-active-site penicillin-interacting proteins.
TI  - [Survey of the sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  - Research groups were formed in 21 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance. The activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems were tested against clinical isolates collected from these institutions. The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,282 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at all institutions between October and December 1995. The results were as follows: 1. Carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against MSSA and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Their activities against Enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of ABPC. Carbapenems showed low activities against MRSA. 2. OFLX exhibited the greatest antibacterial activity against Haemophilus influenzae, followed by MEPM. The antibacterial activities of the other carbapenems were comparable to those of FMOX and CTM. 3. The carbapenems showed high activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Bacteroides fragilis group. Their activities were greater than that exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents. The carbapenems also exhibited greater antibacterial activities against Serratia marcescens than the other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains were detected. 4. The antibacterial activities of carbapenems against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were comparable to those of CAZ, AZT, AMK.
TI  - Regulation of a new cell wall hydrolase gene, cwlF, which affects cell separation in Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - Bacillus subtilis produces a 35-kDa cell wall hydrolase, CwlF, during vegetative  growth. The CwlF protein was extracted from B. subtilis cwlB sigD mutant cells and separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. N-terminal amino acid sequencing revealed that its sequence is completely identical to that of the internal region of the papQ gene product. Disruption of the papQ gene in the B. subtilis chromosome led to the complete loss of CwlF, indicating that papQ is identical to cwlF. CwlF exhibits high sequence similarity to the p60 proteins of Listeria species, NlpC proteins of Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae, and Enp2 protein of Bacillus sphaericus. The beta-galactosidase activity of the cwlF-lacZ transcriptional fusion and Northern blot analysis of the cwlF gene indicated that the gene is expressed as a monocistronic operon during the exponential growth phase, and primer extension analysis suggested that the cwlF gene is transcribed mainly by EsigmaA RNA polymerase and weakly by EsigmaH RNA polymerase. While the cells of the cwlF-deficient mutant were about twice as long as those of the wild-type strain, the cwlF sigD double mutant cells exhibited extraordinary microfiber formation, in contrast to the filamentation of the sigD mutant. The CwlF production was not affected by the pleiotropic mutations flaD1 and degU32(Hy), which endow cells with the ability of extensive filamentation.
TI  - Strand compositional asymmetry in bacterial and large viral genomes.
AB  - Several bacterial genomes exhibit preference for G over C on the DNA leading strand extending from the origin of replication to the ter-region in the genomes of Escherichia coli, Mycoplasma genitalium, Bacillus subtilis, and marginally in Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Helicobacter pylori. Strand compositional asymmetry is not observed in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. genome nor in the archaeal genomes of Methanococcus jannaschii, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, and Archaeoglobus fulgidus. A strong strand compositional asymmetry is observed in beta-type but not alpha- or gamma-type human herpesviruses featuring G > C downstream of oriL and C > G upstream of oriL. Dinucleotide relative abundances (i.e., dinucleotide representations normalized by the component nucleotide frequencies) are consonant with respect to the leading and lagging strands. Strand compositional asymmetry may reflect on differences in replication synthesis of the leading versus lagging strand, on differences between template and coding strand associated with transcription-coupled repair mechanisms, on differences in gene density between the two strands, on differences in residue and codon biases in relation to gene function, expression level, or operon organization, or on differences in single or context-dependent base mutational rates. The absence of strand asymmetry in the archaeal genomes may reflect the presence of multiple origins of replication.
TI  - Bacterial aspartic proteinases as novel antibiotic targets.
AB  
TI  - [Correlation between pulmonary pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics support the  hypothesis of the usefulness of ceftazidime at a single 1g daily dose in the treatment of bacterial exacerbation of chronic obstructive bronchopneumonia with moderate functional damage].
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND: Experimental studies have shown that cephalosporins  have an antibacterial effect in vivo even when their levels are above MIC for only 40-50% of dosing intervals, whereas maximum killing is obtained when concentrations are above MIC for 60-70% of the time. Since most patients treated with antibiotics have neutrophils and other natural defence mechanisms, it is likely that a bacteriostatic effect should be sufficient to induce an effective therapeutic response. METHODS: Given that in the potential sites of lung infection ceftazidime reaches significantly higher levels than the MIC of the most commonplace respiratory pathogens, even 8-12 hours after the administration of 1 g i.m., the authors evaluated the efficacy of treatment of renewed acute episodes of COPD using this antibiotic at a dose of 1 g once a day. In order to do this, 20 outpatients were enrolled in the study, half of whom presented moderate bronchial obstruction (FEV1 = 50-70% of theoretical) whereas the remainder presented marked bronchial obstruction (FEV1 = < 50% of theoretical). RESULTS: The 10 patients with moderate obstruction at the time of enrollment, who presented Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae or Moraxella catarrhalis as causal agents in the sputum (Escherichia coli was only isolated in one patient), showed a marked improvement following treatment with 1 g ceftazidime one a day. A real or presumed eradication of the causal microorganism was observed in all subjects. Treatment with ceftazidime at the dose of 1 g/die once a day was much less effective in patients with marked bronchial obstruction. Treatment was successful in 7 out of 10 subjects, but 2 of them relapsed within 2 weeks. In this second group, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found in the sputum of 3 patients; one of the patients showed a persistence of the bacterium after ceftazidime treatment, and another presented reinfection 12 days after the end of treatment. The two patients in whom Staphylococcus aureus was isolated did not benefit from ceftazidime treatment at this dosage. One subject who initially presented Streptococcus pneumoniae in his sputum and was then thought to have recovered, underwent a new acute episode caused by Moraxella catarrhalis 2 weeks after the suspension of ceftazidime treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic responses observed during this study suggest the possibility of using ceftazidime in a single daily dose of 1 g i.m. to treat those patients with exacerbations of COPD who only present moderately impaired functional symptoms. On the contrary, this type of therapeutic approach must be used with extreme caution in subjects with marked functional damage, although a satisfactory clinical response may be obtained in some cases. However, the small number of patients included in this study does not allow firm conclusions to be drawn. Only a study involving a larger group of patients could provide the necessary information to confirm the hypothesis for treatment put forward by the authors.
TI  - Periplasmic nitrate-reducing system of the phototrophic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides DSM 158: transcriptional and mutational analysis of the napKEFDABC gene cluster.
AB  - The phototrophic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides DSM 158 is able to reduce nitrate to nitrite by means of a periplasmic nitrate reductase which is induced by nitrate and is not repressed by ammonium or oxygen. Recently, a 6.8 kb PstI DNA fragment carrying the napABC genes coding for this periplasmic nitrate-reducing system was cloned [Reyes, Roldan, Klipp, Castillo and Moreno-Vivian (1996) Mol. Microbiol. 19, 1307-1318]. Further sequence and genetic analyses of the DNA region upstream from the napABC genes reveal the presence of four additional nap genes. All these R. sphaeroides genes seem to be organized into a napKEFDABC transcriptional unit. In addition, a partial open reading frame similar to the Azorhizobium caulinodans yntC gene and the Escherichia coli yjcC and yhjK genes is present upstream from this nap gene cluster. The R. sphaeroides napK gene codes for a putative 6.3 kDa transmembrane protein which is not similar to known proteins and the napE gene codes for a 6.7 kDa transmembrane protein similar to the Thiosphaera pantotropha NapE. The R. sphaeroides napF gene product is a 16.4 kDa protein with four cysteine clusters that probably bind four [4Fe-4S] centres. This iron-sulphur protein shows similarity to the NapF and NapG proteins of E. coli and Haemophilus influenzae. Finally, the napD gene product is a 9.4 kDa soluble protein which is also found in E. coli and T. pantotropha. The 5' end of the nap transcript has been determined by primer extension, and a sigma70-like promoter has been identified upstream from the napK gene. The same transcriptional start site is found for cells growing aerobically or anaerobically with nitrate. Different mutant strains carrying defined polar and non-polar insertions in each nap gene were constructed. Characterization of these mutant strains demonstrates the participation of the nap gene products in the periplasmic nitrate reduction in R. sphaeroides.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activities of cefteram and other beta-lactam agents against recent clinical isolates].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activity of the third-generation oral cephem cefteram (CFTM)--ten years after its first use in the clinical setting--against recent clinical isolates was evaluated and compared with those of other oral cephems. A total of 851 clinical isolates belonging to 13 species used in this study were collected from five medical institutions across Japan during 1996. CFTM showed excellent antibacterial activity against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and S. pyogenes, equivalent to those of other third-generation oral cephems, except cefixime. Of the S. pneumoniae strains, a high proportion, 34.1%, were penicillin-resistant strains (PRSP), with MIC values of 2.0 micrograms/ml or above, but the MIC50 of CFTM against PRSP was 1.0 microgram/ml. CFTM and the other third-generation oral cephems showed potent antibacterial activity against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis. A few strains of E. coli, however, were highly resistant to third-generation oral cephems; that might include extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains. MIC values against P. vulgaris varied significantly, depending on whether they were determined by the broth micro-dilution method or the agar dilution method; growth was observed at high concentrations in the broth micro-dilution method, in which the skip phenomenon was demonstrated, but not in the agar dilution method. The reason for this discrepancy is unknown. Most strains of S. marcescens, C. freundii, and E. cloacae demonstrated resistance to CFTM and the other third-generation oral cephems. CFTM and the other third-generation oral cephems showed excellent antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, N. gonorrhoeae, and H. influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains.
TI  - The periplasmic, group III catalase of Vibrio fischeri is required for normal symbiotic competence and is induced both by oxidative stress and by approach to stationary phase.
AB  - The catalase gene, katA, of the sepiolid squid symbiont Vibrio fischeri has been  cloned and sequenced. The predicted amino acid sequence of KatA has a high degree of similarity to the recently defined group III catalases, including those found in Haemophilus influenzae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Proteus mirabilis. Upstream of the predicted start codon of katA is a sequence that closely matches the consensus sequence for promoters regulated in Escherichia coli by the alternative sigma factor encoded by rpoS. Further, the level of expression of the cloned katA gene in an E. coli rpoS mutant is much lower than in wild-type E. coli. Catalase activity is induced three- to fourfold both as growing V. fischeri cells approach stationary phase and upon the addition of a small amount of hydrogen peroxide during logarithmic growth. The catalase activity was localized in the periplasm of wild-type V. fischeri cells, where its role could be to detoxify hydrogen peroxide coming from the external environment. No significant catalase activity could be detected in a katA null mutant strain, demonstrating that KatA is the predominately expressed catalase in V. fischeri and indicating that V. fischeri carries only a single catalase gene. The catalase mutant was defective in its ability to competitively colonize the light organs of juvenile squids in coinoculation experiments with the parent strain, suggesting that the catalase enzyme plays an important role in the symbiosis between V. fischeri and its squid host.
TI  - Identification of the Chi site of Haemophilus influenzae as several sequences related to the Escherichia coli Chi site.
AB  - The Escherichia coli Chi site 5'-GCTGGTGG-3' modulates the activity of the powerful dsDNA exonuclease and helicase RecBCD. Genome sequence analyses revealed that Chi is frequent on the chromosome and oriented with respect to replication on the E. coli genome. Chi is also present much more frequently than predicted statistically for a random 8-mer sequence. Although it is assumed that Chi is ubiquitous, there is virtually no proof that its features are conserved in other microorganisms. We therefore identified and analysed the Chi sequence of an organism for which the full genome sequence was available, Haemophilus influenzae. The biological test we used is based on our finding that rolling circle plasmids provide a specific substrate for RecBCD analogues in different microorganisms. Unexpectedly, several related sequences, corresponding to 5'-GNTGGTGG-3' and 5'-G(G/C)TGGAGG-3', showed Chi activity. As in E. coli, the H. influenzae Chi sites are frequent on the genome, which is in keeping with the need for frequent Chi sites for dsDNA break repair of chromosomal DNA. Although statistically over-represented, this feature is less marked than that of the E. coli Chi site. In contrast to E. coli, the H. influenzae Chi motifs are only slightly oriented with respect to the replication strand. Thus, although Chi appears to have a highly conserved biological role in attenuating exonuclease activity, its sequence characteristics and statistical representation on the genome may differ according to the particular features of the host.
TI  - Increasing prevalence of Kingella kingae in osteoarticular infections in young children.
AB  - Sixty children younger than 3 years with culture-positive hematogenous septic arthritis and acute/subacute osteomyelitis treated between 1990 and 1995 were reviewed to identify the infecting organism. Gram-positive bacteria were identified in 47 (78.3%) patients, and gram-negative organisms were identified in 13 (21.7%) patients. Haemophilus influenzae was cultured in none of the cases of septic arthritis and in only one (1.6%) case of acute osteomyelitis. Kingella kingae was cultured in 10 (16.7%) cases, with all of these patients between the ages of 10.5 and 23.5 months. Routine immunization of infants against H. influenzae has caused a change in the historically reported bacteria of bone and joint infections in children younger than 3 years. Haemophilus influenzae has lost its predominance as the most commonly identified gram-negative pathogen, and in this study, has been replaced by K. kingae.
TI  - Identification of 10Sa RNA (tmRNA) homologues from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC6301 and related organisms.
AB  - We have isolated the 10Sa RNA (tmRNA) from the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC6301. It comprises of 394 nucleotides (nt) and has 55% homology to Escherichia coli tmRNA. The cloning and sequencing of the corresponding gene have revealed that, like in many tRNA genes, the terminal CCA sequence reported in all the tmRNA species characterized so far is not encoded in the DNA. Hybridization analysis has shown that the tmRNA gene is present as a single copy. Fairly high levels of tmRNA accumulate throughout the cell cycle; however, a slight increase in its level is observed during late-log to stationary phase. This suggests that tmRNA is functional not only when cells divide actively but also when cell growth stops.
TI  - Functional characterization of the Haemophilus influenzae 4.5S RNA.
AB  - The putative 4.5S RNA of Haemophilus influenzae was identified in the genome by computer analysis, amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, and cloned. We have determined that this putative 4.5S RNA will complement an Escherichia coli strain conditionally defective in 4.5S RNA production. The predicted secondary structures of the molecules were quite similar, but Northern analysis showed that the H. influenzae RNA was slightly larger than the E. coli RNA. The H. influenzae gene encoding this RNA is the functional homolog of the ffs gene in E. coli.
TI  - Evolution of a transfer RNA gene through a point mutation in the anticodon.
AB  - The transfer RNA (tRNA) multigene family comprises 20 amino acid-accepting groups, many of which contain isoacceptors. The addition of isoacceptors to the tRNA repertoire was critical to establishing the genetic code, yet the origin of isoacceptors remains largely unexplored. A model of tRNA evolution, termed "tRNA gene recruitment," was formulated. It proposes that a tRNA gene can be recruited from one isoaccepting group to another by a point mutation that concurrently changes tRNA amino acid identity and messenger RNA coupling capacity. A test of the model showed that an Escherichia coli strain, in which the essential tRNAUGUThr gene was inactivated, was rendered viable when a tRNAArg with a point mutation that changed its anticodon from UCU to UGU (threonine) was expressed. Insertion of threonine at threonine codons by the "recruited" tRNAArg was corroborated by in vitro aminoacylation assays showing that its specificity had been changed from arginine to threonine. Therefore, the recruitment model may account for the evolution of some tRNA genes.
TI  - Two genes involved in the 1,3-diaminopropane production pathway in Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - We previously cloned and sequenced the Acinetobacter baumannii dat and ddc genes  encoding L-2,4-diaminobutyrate: 2-ketoglutarate 4-aminotransferase (DABA AT) and DABA decarboxylase, respectively, involved in the 1,3-diaminopropane (DAP) production pathway. Homology searches of the gene products provided an indication that a similar gene cluster is present in the genome of Haemophilus influenzae Rd. This was first verified by detection of the corresponding enzyme activities in and the production of DAP by all H. influenzae strains examined. Both of the crude enzymes from the representative strain of H. influenzae showed catalytic properties essentially similar to the A. baumannii DABA AT and DABA DC. An Escherichia coli clone carrying the dat homolog of H. influenzae Rd showed a high level of DABA AT activity, the enzyme protein responsible being detected by immunoblot analysis. These results specify the two H. influenzae genes involved in DAP production.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and expression of the acylneuraminate lyase gene from Clostridium perfringens A99.
AB  - The acylneuraminate lyase gene from Clostridium perfringens A99 was cloned on a 3.3 kb HindIII DNA fragment identified by screening the chromosomal DNA of this species by hybridization with an oligonucleotide probe that had been deduced from the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified protein, and another probe directed against a region that is conserved in the acylneuraminate lyase gene of Escherichia coli and in the putative gene of Clostridium tertium. After cloning, three of the recombinant clones expressed lyase activity above the background of the endogenous enzyme of the E. coli host. The sequenced part of the cloned fragment contains the complete acylneuraminate lyase gene (ORF2) of 864 bp that encodes 288 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 32.3 kDa. The lyase structural gene follows a noncoding region with an inverted repeat and a ribosome binding site. Upstream from this regulatory region another open reading frame (ORF1) was detected. The 3'-terminus of the lyase structural gene is followed by a further ORF (ORF3). A high homology was found between the amino acid sequences of the sialate lyases from Clostridium perfringens and Haemophilus influenzae (75% identical amino acids) or Trichomonas vaginalis (69% identical amino acids), respectively, whereas the similarity to the gene from E. coli is low (38% identical amino acids). Based on our new sequence data, the 'large' sialidase gene and the lyase gene of C. perfringens are not arranged next to each other on the chromosome of this species.
TI  - The sodA gene of Haemophilus ducreyi encodes a hydrogen peroxide-inhibitable superoxide dismutase.
AB  - Haemophilus ducreyi is the etiologic agent of the sexually transmitted disease chancroid, an ulcerative condition implicated in increased HIV transmission. There is increasing evidence for the roles of oxidative stress proteins including superoxide dismutase enzymes in the survival and persistence of pathogenic organisms within the host. The sodA gene of Haemophilus ducreyi was isolated from a genomic plasmid library on the basis of its ability to rescue the hydrogen peroxide hypersensitivity of an Escherichia coli sodA sodB strain. The H. ducreyi SodA protein also complemented the aerobic growth defect of the E. coli sodA sodB strain in minimal medium. The deduced amino-acid sequence of the H. ducreyi sodA gene product is 74 and 70% identical to the Mn-SODs of Haemophilus influenzae and E. coli, respectively. However, unlike Mn-SODs, the H ducreyi SodA protein was inhibited by hydrogen peroxide in native gels stained for SOD activity.
TI  - Abundant microsatellite polymorphism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the different distributions of microsatellites in eight prokaryotes and S. cerevisiae, result from strong mutation pressures and a variety of selective forces.
AB  - We examined the distributions of short tandemly repeated DNAs (microsatellites) in nine complete microbial genomes (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Methanococcus jannaschii, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, M. genitalium, and Synechocystis PCC6803.) These repeats contribute differently to the global features of these genomes, and we explore the evolutionary implications of these differences by empirical examination of length polymorphisms at 20 long triplet-repeats repeats in S. cerevisiae, and by comparison of observed and expected repeat distributions. All of a sample of 20 microsatellites found in S. cerevisiae are highly polymorphic in length, suggesting that mutation pressure overcomes overall selection for small genome size that will tend to shorten or eliminate unnecessary DNA. By comparison, prokaryotes have fewer long repeats than expected, except for a few statistically improbable repeats that appear to function in gene regulation. Finally, we find that in all these genomes there is an excess of repeats shorter than those traditionally considered to be microsatellites. This finding suggests that even in prokaryotes these repeats are being generated by mutational pressures. These results have important potential implications for understanding genome stability and evolution in these microbial species.
TI  - Characterization of the Pasteurella haemolytica transferrin receptor genes and the recombinant receptor proteins.
AB  - The tbpA and tbpB genes encoding the transferrin receptor proteins, TbpA and TbpB, from Pasteurella haemolytica A1 were cloned, sequenced and expressed in Escherichia coli. The genes were organized in a putative operon arrangement of tbpB- tbpA. The tbpB gene was preceded by putative promoter and regulatory sequences, and followed by a 96 base pair intergenic sequence in which no promoter regions were found, suggesting that the two genes are coordinately transcribed. The deduced amino acid sequences of the TbpA and TbpB proteins had regions of homology with the corresponding Neisseria meningitidis, N. gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae Tbp and Lbp proteins. The intact tbpB gene was expressed in a T7 expression system and the resulting recombinant TbpB protein retained the functional bovine transferrin binding characteristics. The availability of the recombinant TbpB enabled us to demonstrate its specificity for ruminant transferrins, its ability to bind both the C-and N-terminal lobes of bovine transferrin and its preference for the iron-loaded form of this protein. Several attempts at expressing the cloned tbpA gene were unsuccessful, suggesting that the product of the gene may be toxic to E. coli.
TI  - Overexpression in Escherichia coli of the rnf genes from Rhodobacter capsulatus--characterization of two membrane-bound iron-sulfur proteins.
AB  - The rnf genes of Rhodobacter capsulatus, essential for nitrogen fixation, are thought to encode a system for electron transport to nitrogenase. In the present study, we have attempted to overexpress the rnf genes in Escherichia coli to investigate the molecular properties of the corresponding proteins. Corrections were made to the published DNA sequence of the rnf operon, resulting in the identification of two genes, rnfG and rnfH. The rnfABCDGEH operon thus comprises seven genes and shows similarities in gene arrangement and deduced protein sequences to homologous regions in the genomes of Haemophilus influenzae and E. coli. Four of the rnf gene products were found to be similar in sequence to components of an Na+-dependent NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase from Vibrio alginolyticus. Three of the rnf genes were successfully overexpressed in E. coli as His-tagged polypeptides, whereas the products of rnfA, rnfD and rnfE, predicted to be transmembrane proteins, could not be stably maintained in E. coli. The rnfB and rnfC gene products were isolated as two brown proteins with apparent molecular-mass values of 25 kDa and 55 kDa, respectively. RnfB was shown to contain one [2Fe-2S] cluster, based on absorption spectrophotometry, EPR spectroscopy and iron content. Recombinant RnfC contained at least one iron-sulfur cluster, most likely of the [4Fe-4S] type. Unambiguous identification of the prosthetic groups was, however, precluded by the extreme instability of this protein. In R. capsulatus, RnfB and RnfC were found by immunoblot analysis to be tightly bound to the membrane, despite their hydrophilic character. The RnfB and RnfC proteins were absent in mutant strains bearing insertions at various positions within the rnfABCDGEH operon, suggesting that their stability depends on the cosynthesis of the other rnf gene products. We observed that iron limitation during growth resulted in a decrease both in the cellular content of RnfB and in the level of transcription of the rnfABCDGEH operon, indicating that the expression of this operon is regulated as a function of iron availability.
TI  - The evolutionary relationships between the two bacteria Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae and their putative last common ancestor.
AB  - We have tried to approach the nature of the last common ancestor to Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli and to determine how each bacterium could have diverged from this putative organism. The approach used was exhaustive analysis of the homologous proteins coded by genes present in these bacteria, using as criteria for sequence relatedness an alignment of at least 80 amino acid residues and a PAM distance (number of accepted point mutations per 100 residues separating two sequences) below 250. Evolutionarily significant similarities were found between 1,345 H. influenzae proteins (85% of the total genome) and 3,058 E. coli. proteins (75% of the total genome), many of them belonging to families of various sizes (from 666 doublets to 35 large groups of more than 10 members). Nearly all the genes found by this approach to be duplicated in both bacteria were already duplicated in their last common ancestor. This was deduced from (1) the comparison of the respective distributions of evolutionary distances between orthologs (genes separated only by speciation events) and paralogs (genes duplicated in the same genome) and (2) the analysis of the phylogenetic trees reconstructed for each family of paralogs containing at least two members belonging to each bacterium. The distributions of the different categories of homologs show a significant loss of paralogous genes in H. influenzae (reduction proportional to the genome size), of many sequences which are still present in one copy in E. coli, and of some entire gene families. Phylogenetic trees also confirmed this recent loss of paralogous genes in H. influenzae. Thus, the genome size of the last common ancestor of these two bacteria would have been close to that of present-day E. coli, and the evolution of H. influenzae toward a parasitic life led to an important decrease in its genome size by some mechanism of streamlining. During this recent evolution, the memory of the gene order present in the last common ancestor has been blurred, but a few short conserved chromosomal fragments can still be detected in present-day E. coli and H. influenzae.
TI  - Secretion of the Haemophilus influenzae HMW1 and HMW2 adhesins involves a periplasmic intermediate and requires the HMWB and HMWC proteins.
AB  - Non-typable Haemophilus influenzae is a common cause of human disease and initiates infection by colonizing the upper respiratory tract. The non-typeable H. influenzae HMW1 and HMW2 non-pilus adhesins mediate attachment to human epithelial cells, an essential step during colonization. In order to facilitate interaction with host cells, HMW1 and HMW2 are localized on the surface of the organism in a process that involves cleavage of a 441-amino-acid N-terminal fragment. In the present study, we investigated the pathway for the secretion of HMW1 and HMW2. Cell fractionation experiments and cryoimmunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that a periplasmic intermediate occurs, suggesting involvement of the Sec machinery. Additional analysis revealed that, ultimately, the proteins are partially released from the surface of the organism. Studies with Escherichia coli harbouring plasmid subclones extended earlier findings and suggested that the secretion of HMW1 requires accessory proteins designated HMW1B and HMW1C, while the secretion of HMW2 requires proteins called HMW2B and HMW2C. Further analysis established that HMW1B/HMW1C and HMW2B/HMW2C are interchangeable, an observation consistent with the high degree of homology between HMW1B and HMW2B and between HMW1C and HMW2C. Additional studies of the hmw1 locus indicated that HMW1B is located in the outer membrane and serves to translocate HMW1 across the outer membrane. In the absence of HMW1B, HMW1 remains unprocessed and is degraded in the periplasmic space, at least in part by the DegP protease. Mutagenesis of an HMW1 N-terminal motif shared with other secreted proteins resulted in diminished processing and extracellular release, suggesting interaction of this motif with the HMW1B protein. Continued investigation of the HMW1 and HMW2 adhesins may provide general insights into protein secretion and bacterial pathogenesis.
TI  - Functional expression in Escherichia coli of the Haemophilus influenzae gene coding for selenocysteine-containing selenophosphate synthetase.
AB  - The selenophosphate synthetases from several organisms contain a selenocysteine residue in their active site where the Escherichia coli enzyme contains a cysteine. The synthesis of these enzymes, therefore, depends on their own reaction product. To analyse how this self-dependence is correlated with the selenium status, e.g. after recovery from severe selenium starvation, we expressed the gene for the selenocysteine-containing selenophosphate synthetase from Haemophilus influenzae (selDHI) in an E. coli DeltaselD strain. Gene selDHI gave rise to a selenium-containing gene product and also supported - via its activity - the formation of E. coli selenoproteins. The results provide evidence either for the suppression of the UGASec codon with the insertion of an amino acid allowing the formation of a functional product or for a bypass of the selenophosphate requirement. We also show that the selenocysteine synthesis and the insertion systems of the two organisms are fully compatible despite conspicuous differences in the mRNA recognition motif.
TI  - A 71-kDa protein from Halobacterium salinarium belongs to a ubiquitous P-loop ATPase superfamily with head-rod-tail structure.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a genomic fragment from Halobacterium salinarium containing an open reading frame encoding a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 71 kDa was determined. Database searches revealed that this protein, Hp71, has similarities to eukaryotic cytoskeletal proteins. Heterologous production of Hp71 in Escherichia coli allowed the isolation of anti-Hp71 antibodies. The antibodies were used (1) to verify the production of Hp71 in H. salinarium and (2) to determine its cytoplasmic localization by immune electron microscopy. Homologous overproduction of Hp71 in H. salinarium and heterologous production in Haloferax volcanii resulted in modifications of cell morphology from rods to extended rods, and from pleiomorphic cells to rods, respectively. Structure prediction methods indicated that Hp71 has a head-rod-tail configuration, including an N-terminal domain with a nucleotide binding motif (P-loop), and an extended discontinuous coiled-coil domain of 330 amino acids. To identify related proteins, the complete genomes of Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma genitalium, and Methanococcus jannaschii were searched for deduced proteins with extended coiled-coil domains. Only one or two proteins were found for each organism, showing that Hp71 is one of only a few prokaryotic intracellular proteins with extended coiled-coil domains. The phenotype upon overproduction and the similarity of Hp71 to the SMC superfamily of P-loop head-rod-tail proteins (named after SMC1, which is involved in the "stability of minichromosomes" in yeast) indicate that Hp71 might be involved in cytoskeleton formation and/or chromosome partitioning in H. salinarium.
TI  - The Haemophilus influenzae HtrA protein is a protective antigen.
AB  - The htrA gene from two strains of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae has been cloned and sequenced, and the encoded approximately 46-kDa HtrA proteins were found to be highly conserved. H. influenzae HtrA has approximately 55% identity with the Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium HtrA stress response proteins, and expression of the H. influenzae htrA gene was inducible by high temperature. Recombinant HtrA (rHtrA) was expressed from E. coli, and the purified protein was found to have serine protease activity. rHtrA was found to be very immunogenic and partially protective in both the passive infant rat model of bacteremia and the active chinchilla model of otitis media. Immunoblot analysis indicated that HtrA is antigenically conserved in encapsulated and nontypeable H. influenzae species. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the htrA gene to ablate the endogenous serine protease activity of wild-type HtrA, and it was found that eight of nine recombinant mutant proteins had no measurable residual proteolytic activity. Two mutant proteins were tested in the animal protection models, and one, H91A, was found to be partially protective in both models. H91A HtrA may be a good candidate antigen for a vaccine against invasive H. influenzae type b disease and otitis media and is currently in phase I clinical trials.
TI  - The infectious complications of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
AB  - Infectious complications continue to have a major impact on the clinical course of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia despite advances in therapeutic approaches to this disease and supportive care. Although the pathogenesis of infection in these patients is multifactorial, systemic hypogammaglobulinemia is the major immune defect accounting for the increased risk of infection. Despite common knowledge of systemic immune defects in this population, information regarding mucosal immune function is minimal. In patients treated with conventional alkylating agents, infections commonly occur at mucosal sites, especially the respiratory tract, and organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are frequent isolates. The use of purine analogues as fludarabine has resulted in a change in this spectrum of infection, with the appearance of opportunistic infections caused by Pneumocystis, Listeria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Nocardia, Candida, Aspergillus, and herpesviruses. Further knowledge of the impact of chemotherapy on immune function, and of the immune defects in these patients, both inherent to the primary disease process and therapy-related, will aid in the formulation of better prophylactic and therapeutic interventions to reduce the risk of infection and improve the ultimate outcome of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
TI  - Purification of Leuconostoc mesenteroides citrate lyase and cloning and characterization of the citCDEFG gene cluster.
AB  - A citrate lyase (EC 4.1.3.6) was purified 25-fold from Leuconostoc mesenteroides  and was shown to contain three subunits. The first 42 amino acids of the beta subunit were identified, as well as an internal peptide sequence spanning some 20 amino acids into the alpha subunit. Using degenerated primers from these sequences, we amplified a 1.2-kb DNA fragment by PCR from Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris. This fragment was used as a probe for screening a Leuconostoc genomic bank to identify the structural genes. The 2.7-kb gene cluster encoding citrate lyase of L. mesenteroides is organized in three open reading frames, citD, citE, and citF, encoding, respectively, the three citrate lyase subunits gamma (acyl carrier protein [ACP]), beta (citryl-S-ACP lyase; EC 4.1.3.34), and alpha (citrate:acetyl-ACP transferase; EC 2.8.3.10). The gene (citC) encoding the citrate lyase ligase (EC 6.2.1.22) was localized in the region upstream of citD. Protein comparisons show similarities with the citrate lyase ligase and citrate lyase of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Downstream of the citrate lyase cluster, a 1.4-kb open reading frame encoding a 52-kDa protein was found. The deduced protein is similar to CitG of the other bacteria, and its function remains unknown. Expression of the citCDEFG gene cluster in Escherichia coli led to the detection of a citrate lyase activity only in the presence of acetyl coenzyme A, which is a structural analog of the prosthetic group. This shows that the acetyl-ACP group of the citrate lyase form in E. coli is not complete or not linked to the protein.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of extracts and constituents of Pelargonium sidoides and Pelargonium reniforme.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of extracts and isolated constituents (scopoletin, umckalin, 5,6,7-trimethoxycoumarin, 6,8-dihydroxy-5,7-dimethoxycoumarin, (+)-catechin, gallic acid and its methyl ester) of Pelargonium sidoides and Pelargonium reniforme (Geraniaceae), plant species used in folk medicine by the Southern African native population, was evaluated against 8 microorganisms, including 3 Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus 1451) and 5 Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) varied with the preparation of the extracts and microorganisms tested, from about 0.6 mg/ml for aqueous phases to over 10 mg/ml for crude Pelargonium extracts. With the exception of the ineffective (+)-catechin, all the potentially active compounds exhibited antibacterial activities with MICs of 200-1000 micrograms/ml. The results provide for a rational basis of the traditional use of the titled Pelargonium species.
TI  - Creation of an isogenic P1-deficient mutant of Haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegyptius.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegyptius, the causative agent of Brazilian purpuric fever (BPF), expresses a heat-modifiable 48 kDa outer membrane protein, P1, which is conserved in most Brazilian case-clone isolates. To study the role of P1 in pathogenesis of BPF we constructed via homologous recombination an isogenic P1-deficient mutant of H. influenzae biogroup aegyptius. The procedure involved a modification of Hererot's method for development of competence. Modifications included variations in the growth conditions, use of cAMP, specific characteristics of the donor DNA, and antibiotic selection. P1-deficient mutants were confirmed by SDS-PAGE, loss of reactivity with a specific monoclonal antibody on Western blot, restriction analysis and Southern blot. Our results establish the first successful transformation of homologous DNA into H. influenzae biogroup aegyptius.
TI  - The tryptophanase gene cluster of Haemophilus influenzae type b: evidence for horizontal gene transfer.
AB  - Among strains of Haemophilus influenzae, the ability to catabolize tryptophan (as detected by indole production) varies and is correlated with pathogenicity. Tryptophan catabolism is widespread (70 to 75%) among harmless respiratory isolates but is nearly universal (94 to 100%) among strains causing serious disease, including meningitis. As a first step in investigating the relationship between tryptophan catabolism and virulence, we have identified genes in pathogenic H. influenzae which are homologous to the tryptophanase (tna) operon of Escherichia coli. The tna genes are located on a 3.1-kb fragment between nlpD and mutS in the H. influenzae type b (Eagan) genome, are flanked by 43-bp direct repeats of an uptake signal sequence downstream from nlpD, and appear to have been inserted as a mobile unit within this sequence. The organization of this insertion is reminiscent of pathogenicity islands. The tna cluster is found at the same map location in all indole-positive strains of H. influenzae surveyed and is absent from reference type d and e genomes. In contrast to H. influenzae, most other Haemophilus species lack tna genes. Phylogenetic comparisons suggest that the tna cluster was acquired by intergeneric lateral transfer, either by H. influenzae or a recent ancestor, and that E. coli may have acquired its tnaA gene from a related source. Genomes of virulent H. influenzae resemble those of pathogenic enterics in having an island of laterally transferred DNA next to mutS.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of CS-834, a novel oral carbapenem.
AB  - CS-834 is a novel oral carbapenem antibiotic. This compound is an ester-type prodrug of the active metabolite R-95867. The antibacterial activity of R-95867 was tested against 1,323 clinical isolates of 35 species and was compared with those of oral cephems, i.e., cefteram, cefpodoxime, cefdinir, and cefditoren, and that of a parenteral carbapenem, imipenem. R-95867 exhibited a broad spectrum of activity covering both gram-positive and -negative aerobes and anaerobes. Its activity was superior to those of the other compounds tested against most of the bacterial species tested. R-95867 showed potent antibacterial activity against clinically significant pathogens: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus including ofloxacin-resistant strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin-resistant strains, Clostridium perfringens, Neisseria spp., Moraxella catarrhalis, most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, and Haemophilus influenzae (MIC at which 90% of strains are inhibited, < or =0.006 to 0.78 microg/ml). R-95867 was quite stable to hydrolysis by most of the beta-lactamases tested except the metallo-beta-lactamases from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Bacteroides fragilis. R-95867 showed potent bactericidal activity against S. aureus and Escherichia coli. Penicillin-binding proteins 1 and 4 of S. aureus and 1Bs, 2, 3, and 4 of E. coli had high affinities for R-95867. The in vivo efficacy of CS-834 was evaluated in murine systemic infections caused by 16 strains of gram-positive and -negative pathogens. The efficacy of CS-834 was in many cases superior to those of cefteram pivoxil, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefdinir, and cefditoren pivoxil, especially against infections caused by S. aureus, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, and Proteus vulgaris. Among the drugs tested, CS-834 showed the highest efficacy against experimental pneumonia in mice caused by penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the lytB gene of Campylobacter jejuni.
AB  - LytB of Escherichia coli is an essential gene involved in penicillin tolerance and the stringent response. The lytB gene of Campylobacter jejuni was cloned and characterized. It could complement a temperature-sensitive E. coli lytB mutant. The C. jejuni lytB gene encodes a protein of 277 amino acids that has 34, 36 and 40% amino acid identity with the LytB proteins of E. coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, respectively. The lytB gene is situated between the aroA gene and a gene that encodes ribosomal protein S1.
TI  - A flavodoxin that is required for enzyme activation: the structure of oxidized flavodoxin from Escherichia coli at 1.8 A resolution.
AB  - In Escherichia coli, flavodoxin is the physiological electron donor for the reductive activation of the enzymes pyruvate formate-lyase, anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase, and B12-dependent methionine synthase. As a basis for studies of the interactions of flavodoxin with methionine synthase, crystal structures of orthorhombic and trigonal forms of oxidized recombinant flavodoxin from E. coli have been determined. The orthorhombic form (space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), a = 126.4, b = 41.10, c = 69.15 A, with two molecules per asymmetric unit) was solved initially by molecular replacement at a resolution of 3.0 A, using coordinates from the structure of the flavodoxin from Synechococcus PCC 7942 (Anacystis nidulans). Data extending to 1.8-A resolution were collected at 140 K and the structure was refined to an Rwork of 0.196 and an Rfree of 0.250 for reflections with I > 0. The final model contains 3,224 non-hydrogen atoms per asymmetric unit, including 62 flavin mononucleotide (FMN) atoms, 354 water molecules, four calcium ions, four sodium ions, two chloride ions, and two Bis-Tris buffer molecules. The structure of the protein in the trigonal form (space group P312, a = 78.83, c = 52.07 A) was solved by molecular replacement using the coordinates from the orthorhombic structure, and was refined with all data from 10.0 to 2.6 A (R = 0.191; Rfree = 0.249). The sequence Tyr 58-Tyr 59, in a bend near the FMN, has so far been found only in the flavodoxins from E. coli and Haemophilus influenzae, and may be important in interactions of flavodoxin with its partners in activation reactions. The tyrosine residues in this bend are influenced by intermolecular contacts and adopt different orientations in the two crystal forms. Structural comparisons with flavodoxins from Synechococcus PCC 7942 and Anaebaena PCC 7120 suggest other residues that may also be critical for recognition by methionine synthase.
TI  - [Trend of bacterial meningitis in children over a 14 year period (1981 through 1994) in Japan--an analysis based on studies in 27 institutions].
AB  - We observed 266 children with purulent meningitis in 27 institutions in Japan during the 14 years from 1981 on dividing these years into 3 periods, 1981-1985, 1986-1990 and 1991-1994, and studied the trend of causative organisms identified in 254 among the 266 patients. Their ages were less than 3 months after birth in 50 children and 3 months or older in 216: there were 141 boys and 125 girls. The causative organisms were H. influenzae in 134 patients and S. pneumoniae in 50, most of them being aged 3 months or older. Next to the above bacteria ranked S. agalactiae in 29 and E. coli in 12, many of the patients were aged less than 3 months. Staphylococcus spp. was found in 7 patients and about 70% of them were aged 3 months or older. L. monocytogenes was found in 4 patients and N. meningitidis in 3 and they were aged 3 months or older in both patient groups. S. pyogenes, Enterococcus spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., P. Mirabilis and Enterobacter spp. were detected each in 1 patient. The causative organism was unknown in 21 patients and there was no double infection. H. influenzae were detected in 18 patients in 1981-1985 period (36.7%), in 56 in 1986-1990 (54.9%) and in 60 in 1991-1994 (63.8%) showing an increasing tendency, but S. pneumoniae exhibited neither an increasing nor decreasing tendency. There was a decreasing tendency with S. agalactiae and E. coli, but the details were not clear because there were few patients aged less than 3 months. Although the period of coexistence of 4 main bacterial species was not made clear in this study. Listeria is considered to develop mainly in the early childhood, and we believe that the conventional way of using a cephem preparation and ampicillin combined for patients under 6 years need not be altered. However, panipenem (phonetic) is likely to be effective for insensible S. pneumoniae for the time being.
TI  - Isolation of ALU1-P gene encoding a protein with aluminum tolerance activity from Arthrobacter viscosus.
AB  - We isolated a DNA fragment (ALU1-P) encoding a protein with an activity of aluminum tolerance from an Al tolerant soil microorganism, Arthrobacter viscosus. This microorganism was isolated from acidic tea field soils. The cloned DNA is composed of 1090 nucleotides, which has one open-reading frame without any stop codon. However, when the DNA fragment was transferred into Escherichia coli, a microorganism susceptible to Al toxicity, it endowed E. coli with Al tolerance. The deduced amino acid sequence of the DNA showed 65% identity with the protein of YbaX gene in Escherichia coli, and 51.1% identity with YB91 Haein hypothetical protein of HI1191 gene in Haemophilus influenzae. The ALU1-P gene in the expression vector produced a protein of 192 amino acids deriving a molecular weight of 21.3 kDa by using the stop codon in vector. The ALU1-P gene is a new one that has the characteristic of Al tolerance.
TI  - Identification of the key protein for zinc uptake in Hemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Very little is known about specific mechanisms for zinc accumulation and transport in bacteria. In this study a putative adhesin B in Hemophilus influenzae, the product of gene HI0119, has been identified as a periplasmic zinc-binding protein (PZP1). A pzp1-deficient mutant has been constructed which is defective for growth under aerobic conditions and grows poorly under anaerobic conditions. The growth defect is specifically rescued by supplementing the growth medium with high concentrations of zinc. Subcellular fractionation was used to localize PZP1 to the periplasmic region in a nontypeable H. influenzae strain and in a transfected recombinant Escherichia coli strain (TApzp1). Recombinant PZP1, purified from a periplasmic extract of E. coli strain TApzp1, contained approximately two zinc atoms/protein molecule as determined by neutron activation analysis and atomic absorption spectroscopy. The zinc atoms could be removed by incubation with EDTA, and, by further addition of zinc, a total of five zinc atoms/PZP1 could be bound. Direct binding of 65Zn to the recombinant protein by Western blot was demonstrated. Taken together, these results provide direct evidence that PZP1 plays a key role in zinc uptake by H. influenzae.
TI  - Sequence of the ponA gene and characterization of the penicillin-binding protein  1A of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the ponA gene encoding the high molecular-mass penicillin-binding protein 1A (PBP1A) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) PAO1 was determined and characterized. The predicted PBP1A protein of 822 amino acids (aa) has a calculated molecular mass of 91.2 kDa corresponding to the size of the protein expressed in vitro and in vivo. A penicillin-binding (PB) assay showed that the Pa ponA gene product covalently binds penicillin. The deduced PBP1A aa sequence has features typical of class-A high-molecular-mass PBPs: a highly hydrophobic N-terminus portion containing a potential transmembrane segment which might anchor the protein to the cytoplasmic membrane; an N-terminal module with the conserved boxes 1 (E86D(DN)F(AN)H(Y)G), 2 (G117GS(T)I(TM)Q), 3 (R139K(IN)E(ILL)AL) and 4 (R221R(NW)IL); a PB module with the conserved boxes 5 (S461SFK), (S520RN) and (K695TG); an internal extension at aa 297-407 between the N-terminal and PB modules; and a C-extension at the end of the PB module at aa 742 to 822. The highest percentage of similarity (62.8%) was found with the class A high-molecular-mass PBP1A of Escherichia coli (Ec) and Haemophilus influenzae. The observed extensive homology in the modular design of the Pa PBP1A with the bifunctional Ec PBP1A suggests structural and functional relationships between these proteins and refutes the proposed correspondence between Pa PBP1A and Ec PBP1B.
TI  - Disruption of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa dipZ gene, encoding a putative protein-disulfide reductase, leads to partial pleiotropic deficiency in c-type cytochrome biogenesis.
AB  - The Pseudomonas aeruginosa dipZ gene has been cloned and sequenced. Whereas disruption of Escherichia coli dipZ (dsbD), the hydrophilic C-terminal domain of which has been deduced to be periplasmic and to function as a protein-disulfide reductase, leads to the absence of c-type cytochromes, disruption of P. aeruginosa dipZ attenuated, but did not abolish, holo-c-type cytochrome biosynthesis. Comparison of the P. aeruginosa DipZ sequence with three other DipZ sequences indicated that there are not only two conserved cysteine residues in the C-terminal hydrophilic domain, but also two more in the central highly hydrophobic domain. The latter would be located toward the centre of two of the eight membrane-spanning alpha-helices predicted to compose the hydrophobic central domain of DipZ. Both these cysteine residues, plus other transmembrane helix residues, notably prolines and glycines, are also conserved in a group of membrane proteins, related to Bacillus subtilis CcdA, which lack the N- and C-terminal hydrophilic domains of the DipZ proteins. It is proposed that DipZ of P. aeruginosa and other organisms transfers reducing power from the cytoplasm to the periplasm through reduction and reoxidation of an intramembrane disulfide bond, or other mechanism involving these cysteine residues, and that this function can also be performed by B. subtilis CcdA and other CcdA-like proteins. The failure of dipZ disruption to abolish c-type cytochrome synthesis in P. aeruginosa suggests that, in contrast to the situation in E. coli, the absence of DipZ can be compensated for by one or more other proteins, for example a CcdA-like protein acting in tandem with one or more thioredoxin-like proteins.
TI  - Molecular basis of antimicrobial resistance in non-typable Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Strains of the facultative anaerobe Haemophilus influenzae, both type b and non typable strains, are frequently multiresistant. The measurement of the antibiotic permeability of Haemophilus influenzae outer membrane (OM) shows that antibiotics can cross through the OM easily. Thus, enzymatic activity or efflux pumps could be responsible for multiresistance. An efflux system closely related to AcrAB of Escherichia coli is present in Haemophilus influenzae. However, their role in multiresistance seems irrelevant. Classical mechanisms such as plasmid exchange seems to be playing a major role in the multidrug resistance in Haemophilus influenzae.
TI  - Use of a novel approach, termed island probing, identifies the Shigella flexneri  she pathogenicity island which encodes a homolog of the immunoglobulin A protease-like family of proteins.
AB  - The she gene of Shigella flexneri 2a, which also harbors the internal enterotoxin genes set1A and set1B (F. R. Noriega, GenBank accession no. U35656, 1995) encodes a homolog of the virulence-related immunoglobulin A (IgA) protease-like family of secreted proteins, Tsh, EspC, SepA, and Hap, from an avian pathogenic Escherichia coli, an enteropathogenic E. coli, S. flexneri 5, and Haemophilus influenzae, respectively. To investigate the possibility that this locus was carried on a larger deletable element, the S. flexneri 2a YSH6000T she gene was insertionally disrupted by allelic exchange using a Tn10-derived tetAR(B) cassette. Then, to detect loss of the she locus, the tetracycline-resistant derivative was plated onto fusaric acid medium to select for tetracycline-sensitive revertants, which were observed to arise at a frequency of 10(-5) to 10(-6). PCR and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis confirmed loss of the she::tetAR(B) locus in six independent tetracycline-sensitive isolates. Sample sequencing over a 25-kb region flanking she identified four insertion sequence-like elements, the group II intron-like sequence Sf.IntA, and the 3' end of a second IgA protease-like homolog, sigA, lying 3.6 kb downstream and in an orientation inverted with respect to she. The deletion was mapped to chromosomal NotI fragment A and determined to have a size of 51 kb. Hybridization with flanking probes confirmed that at least 17.7 kb of the 51-kb deletable element was unique to the seven she+ strains investigated, supporting the conclusion that she lay within a large pathogenicity island. The method described in this study, termed island probing, provides a useful tool to further the study of pathogenicity islands in general. Importantly, this approach could also be of value in constructing safer live attenuated bacterial vaccines.
TI  - The acrAB homolog of Haemophilus influenzae codes for a functional multidrug efflux pump.
AB  - Disruption of gene HI0894 or HI0895 in Haemophilus influenzae Rd, homologs of Escherichia coli acrAB multidrug efflux genes, caused hypersusceptibility to erythromycin, rifampin, novobiocin, and dyes such as ethidium bromide and crystal violet and increased accumulation of radioactive erythromycin, showing that these genes are expressed and contribute to the baseline level resistance of this organism through active drug efflux. The gene disruption did not produce detectable changes in susceptibility to several other antibiotics, possibly because rapid influx of small antibiotic molecules through the large H. influenzae porin channels counterbalances their efflux.
TI  - Differential genome display.
AB  
TI  - Molybdate transport and regulation in bacteria.
AB  - Molybdate is transported in bacteria by a high-affinity transport system composed of a periplasmic binding protein, an integral membrane protein, and an energizer protein. These three proteins are coded by modA, modB, and modC genes, respectively. The ModA, ModB, and ModC proteins from various organisms (Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Azotobacter vinelandii, and Rhodobacter capsulatus) are very similar. The lowest Km value reported for molybdate in the molybdate transport process is approximately 50 nM. In a mod mutant, molybdate is transported by the sulfate transport system or by a nonspecific anion transporter. Molybdate transport is tightly coupled to utilization in E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, while other dinitrogen-fixing organisms appear to have a molybdenum storage protein. In all organisms studied so far, molybdate transport genes are regulated by a repressor protein, ModE. The ModE-molybdate complex binds to the sequences TAYAT (Y = T or C) in the operator/ promoter region in E. coli and prevents transcription of the modABCD operon. The ModE-molybdate complex binds to DNA as a homodimer in E. coli and possibly in other organisms as well. In R. capsulatus, however, two ModE homologues (MopAB proteins) are required for repression.
TI  - Conserved gene clusters in bacterial genomes provide further support for the primacy of RNA.
AB  - Five complete bacterial genome sequences have been released to the scientific community. These include four (eu)Bacteria, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma genitalium, M. pneumoniae, and Synechocystis PCC 6803, as well as one Archaeon, Methanococcus jannaschii. Features of organization shared by these genomes are likely to have arisen very early in the history of the bacteria and thus can be expected to provide further insight into the nature of early ancestors. Results of a genome comparison of these five organisms confirm earlier observations that gene order is remarkably unpreserved. There are, nevertheless, at least 16 clusters of two or more genes whose order remains the same among the four (eu)Bacteria and these are presumed to reflect conserved elements of coordinated gene expression that require gene proximity. Eight of these gene orders are essentially conserved in the Archaea as well. Many of these clusters are known to be regulated by RNA-level mechanisms in Escherichia coli, which supports the earlier suggestion that this type of regulation of gene expression may have arisen very early. We conclude that although the last common ancestor may have had a DNA genome, it likely was preceded by progenotes with an RNA genome.
TI  - A comparative study of duplications in bacteria and eukaryotes: the importance of telomeres.
AB  - The genomes of three bacteria (Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma genitalium, and Escherichia coli) and two eukaryotes (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans) were compared. The distribution of their putative open reading frames (ORFs) was studied, and several conclusions were drawn: (1) All of these genomes, even the smallest, exhibit a significant proportion (7%-30%) of duplicated ORFs. This proportion is a function of genome size and appears unrelated to the bacteria/eukaryote division. (2) Some of these ORFs constitute families of up 20 or more members. (3) The levels of sequence similarity within these families are highly variable and their distribution is different among bacteria and eukaryotes. (4) In yeast, there are topological relationships between members of the same family. The paired ORFs are frequently in the same orientation with regard to their respective telomeres and located at comparable distances from them.
TI  - Induction of glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase activity in Escherichia coli and Hemophilus influenza.
AB  - We have examined the induction of glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase (GS-FDH) activity in Escherichia coli and Hemophilus influenza. Formaldehyde was found to induce enzyme activity in both E. coli and H. influenza at concentrations between 0.6 and 20 ppm. Higher formaldehyde concentrations were toxic. Methanol concentrations up to 20% (200,000 ppm) and sodium formate concentrations up to 2% (20,000 ppm) gave negligible amounts of induction. The basic mechanism of induction was probed by inducing GS-FDH activity in the presence of rifampicin to inhibit RNA synthesis or chloramphenicol to inhibit protein synthesis. Both reagents inhibited GS-FDH induction, demonstrating that regulation occurs at the level of transcription. These results indicate that at least one function of GS-FDH in Gram-negative bacteria is to detoxify exogenous formaldehyde encountered in their environment and that GS-FDH inducibility may be a common feature of Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Identification of the Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase homologue.
AB  - To identify potential opsonic targets of Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum, a treponemal genomic expression library was constructed and differentially screened with opsonic and non-opsonic T. pallidum antisera. This method identified an immunoreactive clone containing an open reading frame encoding a 356 residue protein. Nucleotide sequence analysis demonstrated the translated protein to be a homologue of glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase, a glycerol metabolizing enzyme previously identified in Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Borrelia hermsii. Sequence alignment analyses revealed the T. pallidum and H. influenzae enzymes share a high degree of amino acid sequence similarity (72%), suggesting that in T. pallidum this molecule may be surface exposed and involved in IgD binding as is the case with its counterpart in H. influenzae.
TI  - Mutation of the htrB gene in a virulent Salmonella typhimurium strain by intergeneric transduction: strain construction and phenotypic characterization.
AB  - The htrB gene product of Haemophilus influenzae contributes to the toxicity of the lipooligosaccharide. The htrB gene encodes a 2-keto-3-deoxyoctulosonic acid-dependent acyltransferase which is responsible for myristic acid substitutions at the hydroxy moiety of lipid A beta-hydroxymyristic acid. Mass spectroscopic analysis has demonstrated that lipid A from an H. influenzae htrB mutant is predominantly tetraacyl and similar in structure to lipid IV(A), which has been shown to be nontoxic in animal models. We sought to construct a Salmonella typhimurium htrB mutant in order to investigate the contribution of htrB to virulence in a well-defined murine typhoid model of animal pathogenesis. To this end, an r- m+ galE mutS recD strain of S. typhimurium was constructed (MGS-7) and used in inter- and intrastrain transduction experiments with both coliphage P1 and Salmonella phage P22. The Escherichia coli htrB gene containing a mini-Tn10 insertion was transduced from E. coli MLK217 into S. typhimurium MGS-7 via phage P1 and subsequently via phage P22 into the virulent Salmonella strain SL1344. All S. typhimurium transductants showed phenotypes similar to those described for the E. coli htrB mutant. Mass spectrometric analysis of the crude lipid A fraction from the lipopolysaccharide of the S. typhimurium htrB mutant strain showed that for the dominant hexaacyl form, a lauric acid moiety was lost at one position on the lipid A and a palmitic acid moiety was added at another position; for the less abundant heptaacyl species, the lauric acid was replaced with palmitoleic acid.
TI  - TRAP transporters: a new family of periplasmic solute transport systems encoded by the dctPQM genes of Rhodobacter capsulatus and by homologs in diverse gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The dct locus of Rhodobacter capsulatus encodes a high-affinity transport system  for the C4-dicarboxylates malate, succinate, and fumarate. The nucleotide sequence of the region downstream of the previously sequenced dctP gene (encoding a periplasmic C4-dicarboxylate-binding protein) was determined. Two open reading frames (ORFs) of 681 bp (dctQ) and 1,320 bp (dctM) were identified as additional dct genes by insertional mutagenesis and complementation studies. DctQ (24,763 Da) and DctM (46,827 Da) had hydropathic profiles consistent with the presence of 4 and 12 potential transmembrane segments, respectively, and were localized in the cytoplasmic membrane fraction after heterologous expression of the dctQM ORFs in Escherichia coli. DctP, DctQ, and DctM were found to be unrelated to known transport proteins in the ABC (ATP-binding cassette) superfamily but were shown to be homologous with the products of previously unidentified ORFs in a number of gram-negative bacteria, including Bordetella pertussis, E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Haemophilus influenzae, and Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803. An additional ORF (rypA) downstream of dctM encodes a protein with sequence similarity to eukaryotic protein-tyrosine phosphatases, but interposon mutagenesis of this ORF did not result in a Dct- phenotype. Complementation of a Rhizobium meliloti dctABD deletion mutant by heterologous expression of the dctPQM genes from R. capsulatus demonstrated that no additional structural genes were required to form a functional transport system. Transport via the Dct system was vanadate insensitive, and in uncoupler titrations with intact cells, the decrease in the rate of succinate transport correlated closely with the fall in membrane potential but not with the cellular ATP concentration, implying that the proton motive force, rather than ATP hydrolysis, drives uptake. It is concluded that the R. capsulatus Dct system is a new type of periplasmic secondary transporter and that similar, hitherto-unrecognized systems are widespread in gram-negative bacteria. The name TRAP (for tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic) transporters is proposed for this new group.
TI  - Fatty acid biosynthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa: cloning and characterization of the fabAB operon encoding beta-hydroxyacyl-acyl carrier protein dehydratase (FabA) and beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase I (FabB).
AB  - The Pseudomonas aeruginosa fabA and fabB genes, encoding beta-hydroxyacyl-acyl carrier protein dehydratase and beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase I, respectively, were cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli. Northern analysis demonstrated that fabA and fabB are cotranscribed and most probably form a fabAB operon. The FabA and FabB proteins were similar in size and amino acid composition to their counterparts from Escherichia coli and to the putative homologs from Haemophilus influenzae. Chromosomal fabA and fabB mutants were isolated; the mutants were auxotrophic for unsaturated fatty acids. A temperature-sensitive fabA mutant was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of a single base that induced a G101D change; this mutant grew normally at 30 degrees C but not at 42 degrees C, unless the growth medium was supplemented with oleate. By physical and genetic mapping, the fabAB genes were localized between 3.45 and 3.6 Mbp on the 5.9-Mbp chromosome, which corresponds to the 58- to 59.5-min region of the genetic map.
TI  - Outer membrane protein D15 is conserved among Haemophilus influenzae species and  may represent a universal protective antigen against invasive disease.
AB  - We have cloned and sequenced the d15 gene from two strains of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and two strains of nontypeable H. influenzae (NTHI). The nucleotide and deduced protein sequences of d15 are highly conserved, with only a small variable region identified near the carboxyl terminus of the protein. Analysis of upstream sequences revealed that the H. influenzae d15 gene may be part of a large potential operon of closely spaced open reading frames, including one with significant homology to the Escherichia coli cds gene encoding CDP-diglyceride synthetase. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that the d15 gene is also present in H. influenzae types a, c, d, e, and f and in Haemophilus parainfluenzae. A recombinant D15 (rD15) protein was expressed in good quantity in E. coli from the inducible T7 promoter, and monospecific anti-rD15 antibodies were raised. Immunoblot analysis of H. influenzae serotypes a, b, c, d, e, and f, NTHI, and H. parainfluenzae lysates revealed that they all expressed a cross-reactive D15-like protein. Purified rD15 was found to be highly immunogenic in mice, guinea pigs, and rabbits, and passive transfer of anti-rD15 antibodies protected infant rats from challenge with H. influenzae type b or type a in infant rat models of bacteremia. Thus, D15 is a highly conserved antigen that is protective in animal models and it may be a useful component of a universal subunit vaccine against Haemophilus infection and disease.
TI  - Adherence of non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae promotes reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in human or chinchilla epithelial cells in vitro.
AB  - Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) are opportunistic mucosal pathogens which adhere to epithelial cells via a variety of non-specific and specific interactions. Several adhesins have been identified and while the complimentary receptor(s) for each of these adhesins has not yet been fully characterized, it is widely accepted that adherence is an absolute prerequisite for disease. Several reports have indicated that NTHi can also be internalized and reside intracellularly. For this to occur, NTHi must be taken up by mucosal epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract. We have noted, by TEM, that adherent NTHi overlie an electron dense area in the cell membrane of human epithelial cells which is associated with a localized complex assembly of cytoskeletal fibers in the eukaryotic cytoplasm. We thus examined the potential involvement of cytoskeletal actin in this phenomenon via FITC-phalloidin labeling of respiratory tract epithelial cells which had been incubated with several clinical isolates of NTHi. Strong punctate fluorescence was coincident with adherent NTHi to both human oropharyngeal and chinchilla middle ear epithelial cells. This reactivity was similar to the discrete fluorescent spots observed with enteropathogenic Escherichia coli which were adhered to HeLa cells. In contrast, none of the NTHi isolates tested induced actin polymerization in cells of endothelial origin. While the exact mechanisms involved are yet to be elucidated, our data indicated that actin nucleation was coincident with NTHi adherence.
TI  - Expression of small RNAs by Bacillus sp. strain PS3 and B. subtilis cells during  sporulation.
AB  - A small RNA sequence identified in an rRNA-tRNA cluster from the thermophilic Bacillus sp. strain PS3 was examined. An oligonucleotide probe specific for the RNA bound to multiple restriction fragments in Bacillus sp. strain PS3 DNA, thus several copies of this sequence occur in its genome. Similar findings were observed using DNA from B. subtilis, B. stearothermophilus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Thermus thermophilus. This sequence apparently is widespread in the eubacteria. Northern analysis of RNA from sporulating Bacillus sp. strain PS3 and B. subtilis cells revealed RNA species homologous to the probe in both bacteria. Expression of the small RNA in B. subtilis depended on sigma H.

AB  
TI  - Comparison of archaeal and bacterial genomes: computer analysis of protein sequences predicts novel functions and suggests a chimeric origin for the archaea.
AB  - Protein sequences encoded in three complete bacterial genomes, those of Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma genitalium and Synechocystis sp., and the first available archaeal genome sequence, that of Methanococcus jannaschii, were analysed using the BLAST2 algorithm and methods for amino acid motif detection. Between 75% and 90% of the predicted proteins encoded in each of the bacterial genomes and 73% of the M. jannaschii proteins showed significant sequence similarity to proteins from other species. The fraction of bacterial and archaeal proteins containing regions conserved over long phylogenetic distances is nearly the same and close to 70%. Functions of 70-85% of the bacterial proteins and about 70% of the archaeal proteins were predicted with varying precision. This contrasts with the previous report that more than half of the archaeal proteins have no homologues and shows that, with more sensitive methods and detailed analysis of conserved motifs, archaeal genomes become as amenable to meaningful interpretation by computer as bacterial genomes. The analysis of conserved motifs resulted in the prediction of a number of previously undetected functions of bacterial and archaeal proteins and in the identification of novel protein families. In spite of the generally high conservation of protein sequences, orthologues of 25% or less of the M. jannaschii genes were detected in each individual completely sequenced genome, supporting the uniqueness of archaea as a distinct domain of life. About 53% of the M. jannaschii proteins belong to families of paralogues, a fraction similar to that in bacteria with larger genomes, such as Synechocystis sp. and Escherichia coli, but higher than that in H. influenzae, which has approximately the same number of genes as M. jannaschii. Certain groups of proteins, e.g. molecular chaperones and DNA repair enzymes, thought to be ubiquitous and represented in the minimal gene set derived by bacterial genome comparison, are missing in M. jannaschii, indicating massive non-orthologous displacement of genes responsible for essential functions. An unexpectedly large fraction of the M. jannaschii gene products, 44%, shows significantly higher similarity to bacterial than to eukaryotic proteins, compared with 13% that have eukaryotic proteins as their closest homologues (the rest of the proteins show approximately the same level of similarity to bacterial and eukaryotic homologues or have no homologues). Proteins involved in translation, transcription, replication and protein secretion are most closely related to eukaryotic proteins, whereas metabolic enzymes, metabolite uptake systems, enzymes for cell wall biosynthesis and many uncharacterized proteins appear to be 'bacterial'. A similar prevalence of proteins of apparent bacterial origin was observed among the currently available sequences from the distantly related archaeal genus, Sulfolobus. It is likely that the evolution of archaea included at least one major merger between ancestral cells from the bacterial lineage and the lineage leading to the eukaryotic nucleocytoplasm.
TI  - [Survey of sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  - Research groups were formed in 20 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance of clinical isolates. Activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems, were tested against clinical isolates collected from these institutions. The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,326 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at the institutions between October and December 1994. The results are as follows: 1. Carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against MSSA and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Their activities against Enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of ABPC. Carbapenems showed low activities against MRSA. 2. OFLX exhibited the greatest antibacterial activity against Haemophilus influenzae, followed by MEPM. Antibacterial activities of the other carbapenems were comparable to those of FMOX, CTM, and ABPC. 3. The carbapenems showed high activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Bacteroides fragilis group. Their activities were greater than those exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents. The carbapenems also exhibited stronger antibacterial activities against Serratia marcescens than the other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains were detected. 4. The antibacterial activities of carbapenems against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were comparable to those of CAZ, AZT, AMK.
TI  - Vertebral osteomyelitis: nontypeable beta-lactamase-negative Haemophilus influenzae in an adult: case report.
AB  - Adult pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis due to Haemophilus influenzae is exceedingly rare. After a search of the literature, we deemed our case to be the seventh case of H. influenzae pyogenic osteomyelitis. Vertebral osteomyelitis in itself is a rarity. The most common organisms associated with vertebral osteomyelitis are Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Of the six previously reported cases of adult pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis due to H. influenzae, four of the six cases were caused by Type B H. influenzae, one case was attributed to Type C, and the other strain was not typed.
TI  - Genomic rearrangements during evolution of the obligate intracellular parasite Rickettsia prowazekii as inferred from an analysis of 52015 bp nucleotide sequence.
AB  - In this study a description is given of the sequence and analysis of 52 kb from the 1.1 Mb genome of Rickettsia prowazekii, a member of the alpha-Proteobacteria. An investigation was made of nucleotide frequencies and amino acid composition patterns of 41 coding sequences, distributed in 10 genomic contigs, of which 32 were found to have putative homologues in the public databases. Overall, the coding content of the individual contigs ranged from 59 to 97%, with a mean of 81%. The genes putatively identified included genes involved in the biosynthesis of nucleotides, macromolecules and cell wall structures as well as citric acid cycle component genes. In addition, a putative identification was made of a member of the regulatory response family of two-component signal transduction systems as well as a gene encoding haemolysin. For one gene, the homologue of metK, an internal stop codon was discovered within a region that is otherwise highly conserved. Comparisons with the genomic structures of Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae and Bacillus subtilis have revealed several atypical gene organization patterns in the R. prowazekii genome. For example, R. prowazekii was found to have a unique arrangement of genes upstream of dnaA in a region that is highly conserved among other microbial genomes and thought to represent the origin of replication of a primordial replicon. The results presented in this paper support the hypothesis that the R. prowazekii genome is a highly derived genome and provide examples of gene order structures that are unique for the Rickettsia.
TI  - A Salmonella typhimurium genetic locus which confers copper tolerance on copper-sensitive mutants of Escherichia coli.
AB  - Three distinct clones from a Salmonella typhimurium genomic library were identified which suppressed the copper-sensitive (Cu(s)) phenotype of cutF mutants of Escherichia coli. One of these clones, pCUTFS2, also increased the copper tolerance of cutA, -C, and -E mutants, as well as that of a lipoprotein diacylglyceryl transferase (lgt) mutant of E. coli. Characterization of pCUTFS2 revealed that the genes responsible for suppression of copper sensitivity (scs) reside on a 4.36-kb DNA fragment located near 25.4 min on the S. typhimurium genome. Sequence analysis of this fragment revealed four open reading frames (ORF120, ORF627, ORF207, and ORF168) that were organized into two operons. One operon consisted of a single gene, scsA (ORF120), whereas the other operon contained the genes scsB (ORF627), scsC (ORF207), and scsD (ORF168). Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the predicted gene products showed that ScsB, ScsC, and ScsD have significant homology to thiol-disulfide interchange proteins (CutA2, DipZ, CycZ, and DsbD) from E. coli and Haemophilus influenzae, to an outer membrane protein (Com1) from Coxiella burnetii, and to thioredoxin and thioredoxin-like proteins, respectively. The two operons were subcloned on compatible plasmids, and complementation analyses indicated that all four proteins are required for the increased copper tolerance of E. coli mutants. In addition, the scs locus also restored lipoprotein modification in lgt mutants of E. coli. Sequence analyses of the S. typhimurium scs genes and adjacent DNAs revealed that the scs locus is flanked by genes with high homology to the cbpA (predicted curved DNA-binding protein) and agp (acid glucose phosphatase) genes of E. coli located at 22.90 min (1,062.07 kb) and 22.95 min (1,064.8 kb) of the E. coli chromosome, respectively. However, examination of the E. coli chromosome revealed that these genes are absent at this locus and no evidence has thus been obtained for the occurrence of the scs locus elsewhere on the genome.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of a novel gene (recG) that affects the quinolone susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - In a study of the quinolone resistance genes in Staphylococcus aureus, a recG homolog was cloned as a gene affecting quinolone susceptibility. Sequencing analysis revealed that the gene consists of 2,061 nucleotides and encodes a 686-amino-acid polypeptide, which shows 38, 39, and 50% amino acid identity with the RecGs of Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, respectively. Seven helicase motifs are well conserved in the gene product. A plasmid carrying the gene complemented a recG-deficient mutant of E. coli with respect to mitomycin hypersusceptibility, demonstrating that the gene product is functionally equivalent to E. coli RecG. These results indicate that the gene is the recG gene of S. aureus. S. aureus RCM101 (recG::Tn551), designated S. aureus 3f33, is four to eight times more susceptible to quinolones than the parent strain, RCM101. The transformation of strain 3f33 with a plasmid carrying the S. aureus recG gene made it as quinolone resistant as strain RCM101. These results suggest that the recG gene is involved in the repair of DNA damage resulting from quinolone treatment in S. aureus.
TI  - Degradation studies on Escherichia coli capsular polysaccharides by bacteriophages.
AB  - The serologically and structurally related Eschrichia coli capsular polysaccharides (K antigens) K13, K20, and K23 were found to be depolymerized by the bacteriophages phi K13 and phi K20 to almost similar oligomer profiles as shown by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The phage-polysaccharide interactions were followed by an increase of reducing 2-keto-3-deoxyoctulosonic acid due to a phage-associated glycanase that catalyzed the hydrolytic cleavage of common beta-ketopyranosidic 2-keto-3-deoxyoctulosonic acid linkages. The related E. coli K antigens K18, K22, and K100 as well as the Haemophilus influenzae type b capsular polysaccharide were degraded by bacteriophage phi K100 with different efficacy. It is suggested that phi K100 enzymatically cleaves ribitol-5-phosphate bonds as the only structural feature present in all the polysaccharides investigated.
TI  - A Bacillus subtilis gene encoding a protein similar to nucleotide sugar transferases influences cell shape and viability.
AB  - Bacillus subtilis gene ypfP, which is located at 196 degrees on the genetic map,  shows similarity to both the monogalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase gene of Cucumis sativus, which encodes a galactosyltransferase, and the murG genes of B. subtilis, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803, which encode N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Cells containing a null mutation of ypfP are shorter and rounder than wild-type cells during growth in Luria-Bertani medium and glucose minimal medium. In addition, the mutant cells preferentially undergo lysis when grown on solid Luria-Bertani medium.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the two genes coding for L-serine dehydratase from Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus: relationship of the iron-sulfur protein to both L-serine dehydratases from Escherichia coli.
AB  - The structural genes sdhA and sdhB, coding for the alpha- and beta-subunits of the [4Fe-4S] cluster containing L-serine dehydratase from Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, have been cloned and sequenced. Expression of modified sdhB together with sdhA in Escherichia coli led to overproduction of active His6-tagged L-serine dehydratase. E. coli MEW22, deficient in the L-serine dehydratase L-SD1, was complemented by this sdhBA construct. The derived amino acid sequence of SdhBA shares similarities with both monomeric L-serine dehydratases, L-SD1 and L-SD2, from E. coli and with a putative L-serine dehydratase from Haemophilus influenzae, which suggests that these three enzymes are also iron-sulfur proteins.
TI  - The Haemophilus influenzae dprABC genes constitute a competence-inducible operon  that requires the product of the tfoX (sxy) gene for transcriptional activation.
AB  - We previously showed that dprA is required for efficient processing of linear DNA during cellular transformation in Haemophilus influenzae. In this study the transcriptional regulation of dprA and two downstream genes, dprB and dprC, is examined. We demonstrate by Northern blot analysis that the dprABC genes are transcriptionally coregulated and competence inducible. We used primer extension analysis to map the transcriptional start site of dprA and of rec-2, another transformation gene involved in DNA processing. Based upon these results, we were able to identify a 26-bp dyad symmetry element immediately upstream of the -35 regions of the predicted promoters of dprA, rec-2, and two other transformation genes, comA and pilA. Finally, using transcriptional fusions of dprA to the Escherichia coli lacZ gene, we show that expression of dprA::lacZ requires tfoX and that the presence of multiple copies of tfoX abolishes the temporal regulation of dprA, resulting in its constitutive expression.
TI  - Putative evolutionary origin of plasmids carrying the genes involved in leucine biosynthesis in Buchnera aphidicola (endosymbiont of aphids).
AB  - An 8.5-kb plasmid encoding genes (leuABCD) involved in leucine biosynthesis and a small plasmid of 1.74 kb of yet unknown function were found in the intracellular symbiont, Buchnera aphidicola, of two divergent aphid species, Thelaxes suberi and Tetraneura caerulescens, respectively. The leuABCD-carrying plasmid (pBTs1) was amplified from total aphid DNA by inverse long PCR, using outwardly oriented oligonucleotide primers specific to leuA. The resulting 8.2-kb PCR fragment as well as the 1.74-kb plasmid (pBTc1) were cloned and sequenced. pBTs1 differed from a previously described B. aphidicola plasmid (pRPE) of the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi by the presence of a small heat shock gene (ibp) and in the order of the leuABCD and repA genes. Comparison of both leucine plasmids to the small plasmid pBTc1 revealed extensive similarity with respect to putative replication functions as well as in the presence of a highly conserved open reading frame that was found to be homologous to Escherichia coli YqhA and Haemophilus influenzae HI0507 and which may encode an integral membrane protein. The three B. aphidicola plasmids most likely evolved from a common ancestral replicon, which in turn may be distantly related to IncFII plasmids. Phylogenetic affiliations of the B. aphidicola strains of the two aphid species were assessed by sequencing of their 16S rRNA genes. Evaluation of the distribution of the leuABCD-encoding plasmids within a phylogenetic framework suggests independent origins for pBTs1 and pRPE from an ancestral replicon resembling pBTc1. The implications for symbiotic essential amino acid biosynthesis and provisioning are discussed.
TI  - Isolation of the putP gene of Corynebacterium glutamicum and characterization of  a low-affinity uptake system for compatible solutes.
AB  - Corynebacterium glutamicum accumulates the compatible solutes proline, glycine betaine, and ectoine under conditions of high osmolality. Uptake of proline is mediated by both a high-affinity and a low-affinity secondary transport system. The low-affinity uptake system also accepts glycine betaine and ectoine as substrates. In the present study, the gene encoding the high-affinity proline uptake system PutP was isolated by heterologous complementation of Escherichia coli mutant strain WG389, which lacks the transport systems BetT, PutP, ProP, and ProU and is unable to synthesize proline and glycine betaine. This gene (putP) encodes a protein of 524 amino acids that shares identity with the proline transport systems PutP of E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Haemophilus influenzae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Functional studies of PutP synthesized in E. coli mutant strain MKH13, which also lacks the transport systems for compatible solutes and is unable to synthesize glycine betaine, revealed that this carrier system is not regulated by the external osmolality on the level of activity. Km values of 7.6 mM for proline and 1.3 mM for sodium as cotransported ion were determined. Deletion of the putP gene allowed the functional characterization of another proline uptake system with low affinity.
TI  - The RNA molecule CsrB binds to the global regulatory protein CsrA and antagonizes its activity in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The RNA-binding protein CsrA (carbon storage regulator) is a new kind of global regulator, which facilitates specific mRNA decay. A recombinant CsrA protein containing a metal-binding affinity tag (CsrA-H6) was purified to homogeneity and authenticated by N-terminal sequencing, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry, and other studies. This protein was entirely contained within a globular complex of approximately 18 CsrA-H6 subunits and a single approximately 350-nucleotide RNA, CsrB. cDNA cloning and nucleotide sequencing revealed that the csrB gene is located downstream from syd in the 64-min region of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome and contains no open reading frames. The purified CsrA-CsrB ribonucleoprotein complex was active in regulating glg (glycogen biosynthesis) gene expression in vitro, as was the RNA-free form of the CsrA protein. Overexpression of csrB enhanced glycogen accumulation in E. coli, a stationary phase process that is repressed by CsrA. Thus, CsrB RNA is a second component of the Csr system, which binds to CsrA and antagonizes its effects on gene expression. A model for regulatory interactions in Csr is presented, which also explains previous observations on the homologous system in Erwinia carotovora. A highly repeated nucleotide sequence located within predicted stem-loops and other single-stranded regions of CsrB, CAGGA(U/A/C)G, is a plausible CsrA-binding element.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies with cefluprenam in the pediatric field. Pediatric Study Group of Gefluprenam].
AB  - Evaluation of efficacy and safety of cefluprenam (code number: E1077, abbreviation: CFLP), a newly developed injectable cephem antibiotics was conducted on adult patients with various infections, and followed by the study group organized from 39 institutions in pediatric field, as the drug showed no toxicity problems in suckling animals. Informed consents from legal representatives were obtained prior to the study. 1. Clinical efficacy. Two-hundred eighty one cases were included for analysis of clinical efficacy after 40 cases of exclusion or drop-out were subtracted from a total of 321 cases. However, the cumulative number of cases evaluable for analysis was considered to be 289, because 8 cases that had 2 different diseases at the same time were counted in each category of disease. In the cases in which causative organisms were identified (group A), 148 of 154 cases were rated as good or excellent, with an efficacy rate of 96.1%. As for clinical efficacies by disease, efficacy rates were 6/6 for purulent meningitis, 4/5 for sepsis, 95.7% (62/65) for pneumonia, 100.0% (29/29) for urinary tract infections, and 94.1% (16/17) for skin and soft tissue infections. The rate of excellent responses among excellent and good responses was 73.6% (109/148), showing a higher value than any of recent injectable beta-lactams. On 32 cases with S. pneumoniae infection, the efficacy rate of CFLP was 100.0%. In the cases where causative organisms were not identified (group B), 128 of 135 cases were rated as good or excellent, with an efficacy rate of 94.8%. In the all cases including both the group A and the group B, the efficacy rate was 95.2% (276/289) and the rate of excellent responses among excellent and good response was 70.7% (195/276). Against severe infections, CFLP exhibited excellent clinical efficacy, showing an efficacy rate of 8/8 for meningitis, 3/5 for sepsis and 100.0% (22/22) for severe pneumonia. As for bacteriological responses, eradication rates were 95.2% (177/186) in total. Against Gram-positive cocci, the eradication rate was 92.7% (76/82), with eradication rates of 94.3% (33/35) for Staphylococcus aureus, and 93.3% (28/30) for Streptococcus pneumoniae. Against Gram-negative rods, the eradication rate was 97.1% (101/104), and eradication rates were 100.0% (22/22) for Escherichia coli, 97.5% (39/40) for Haemophilus influenzae and 100.0% (19/19) for Molaxella catarrhalis. In cases in which more than 3 days of treatment with previous chemotherapy resulted in no response, the efficacy rate of CFLP was 94.2% (98/104), rated excellent in 68 cases and good in 30 cases. In these cases, the eradication rate was 98.1% (52/53). 2. Pharmacokinetics. CFLP was intravenously administerrd to 12 subjects at doses of 20 to 40 mg (potency)/kg. In 9 subjects aged more than 12 months, maximum serum levels (Cmax), T 1/2 beta and AUC of CFLP were 155.3 +/- 9.8 micrograms/ml, 1.43 +/- 0.18 hours and 111.7 +/- 15.0 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively, when a dose of 20 mg (potency)/kg was used. In 2 subjects aged not more than 12 months, the mean Cmax, T 1/2 beta and AUC were 153 micrograms/ml, 1.6 hour and 81 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively, at a dose of 20 mg(potency)/kg. The mean Cmax, T 1/2 beta and AUC were 332 micrograms/ml, 0.93 hours and 157.3 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively, in 1 subject at a dose of 40 mg (potency)/kg. In 10 subjects dosed 20 mg (potency)/kg, urinary levels were 2413 +/- 512, 1471 +/- 524, and 470 +/- 115 micrograms/ml in 0-2, 2-4, and 4-6 hours after dosing, respectively, showing a cumulative urinary excretion rate of 61.4 +/- 6.3%. In 1 subject dosed 40 mg (potency)/kg, urinary levels were 5700 and 4770 micrograms/ml in 0-2 p3d 2-4 hours after dosing, respectively, showing a cumulative urinary excretion rate of 42.1%. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of CFLP, on 10 subjects with purulent meningitis dosed 40-103 mg (potency)/kg were 3.2-32.9 micrograms/ml at 0.5-2 hours after administration within 4 days after the onset of

TI  - Expression, purification, and functional analysis of the TyrR protein of Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The gene that was inferred to encode the TyrR protein of Haemophilus influenzae Rd was synthesized by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into a T7-based expression vector. Methods were developed to overexpress the TyrR protein of H. influenzae in Escherichia coli and to purify the protein on a large scale. Both in vitro and in vivo functional comparisons of the H. influenzae and E. coli TyrR proteins were carried out. The TyrR protein of H. influenzae was able to bind in vitro to an operator target upstream of the aroF-tyrA gene of E. coli. In the presence of [gamma-S]ATP, the DNA binding ability of the H. influenzae TyrR protein was drastically reduced. Despite the much shorter peptide chain length (318 amino acid residues vs 513), the TyrR protein of H. influenzae was as active in repressing the aroF promoter as the TyrR protein of E. coli. Repression by both proteins was enhanced in the presence of tyrosine; however, the transcriptional activation function associated with the TyrR protein of E. coli could not be detected when the H. influenzae TyrR protein was expressed in E. coli. By computer analysis, at least five operator targets for TyrR were identified within the genomic DNA of H. influenzae. These observations show that the assignment of function to the tyrR gene of H. influenzae was correctly made. Further studies of the H. influenzae TyrR protein in comparison to its E. coli counterpart should provide valuable mechanistic information on transcriptional regulation in this system.
TI  - Identification of two minor subunits in the pilus of Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) organisms produce pili, which mediate attachment to human cells and are multimeric structures composed of a 24-kDa subunit called pilin or HifA. Although pili from other organisms contain additional proteins accessory to pilin, no structural components other than pilin have been identified in Hib pili. Previous analysis of a Hib pilus gene cluster, however, suggested that two genes, hifD and hifE, may encode additional pilus subunits. To determine if hifD and hifE encode pilus components, the genes were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and the resulting proteins were purified and used to raise polyclonal antisera. Antisera raised against C-terminal HifD and HifE fragments reacted with H. influenzae HifD and HifE proteins, respectively, on Western immunoblots. Western immunoblot analysis of immunoprecipitated Hib pili demonstrated that HifD and HifE copurified with pili. In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, antisera raised against a recombinant HifE protein that contained most of the mature protein reacted more to piliated Hib than to nonpiliated Hib or to a mutant containing a hifE gene insertion. Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed that the HifE antiserum bound to pili and demonstrated that the antiserum bound predominantly to the pilus tips. These data indicate that HifD and HifE are pilus subunits. Adherence inhibition studies demonstrated that the HifE antiserum completely blocked pilus-mediated hemagglutination, suggesting that HifE mediates pilus adherence.
TI  - A mono-functional 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) transferase and a Kdo kinase in extracts of Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharide of Haemophilus influenzae contains a single 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) residue, linked to the 6' position of lipid A. In Escherichia coli and related organisms, a Kdo disaccharide is attached to lipid A. In previous studies, we cloned the gene (kdtA) encoding the E. coli Kdo transferase and demonstrated that homogeneous preparations of KdtA polypeptide catalyzed the attachment of both Kdo groups to the precursor, lipid IVA. E. coli KdtA produced only traces of mono-glycosylated product. We now show that a single Kdo is transferred to lipid IVA in extracts of H. influenzae. The mono-functional Kdo transferase of H. influenzae is membrane-bound, and the reaction is dependent upon a CMP-Kdo-generating system, as in E. coli. The specific activity of Kdo transfer to lipid IVA is 0.5-1 nmol/min/mg in H. influenzae membranes. Utilizing solubilized H. influenzae membranes, milligram quantities of Kdo-lipid IVA were prepared for analysis. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry revealed a parent ion (M - H)- at m/z 1626.0, consistent with the addition of a single Kdo moiety. Like lipid IVA, Kdo-lipid IVA was an excellent substrate for the bi-functional Kdo transferase of E. coli. In membranes of H. influenzae, but not E. coli, Kdo-lipid IVA was further phosphorylated in the presence of ATP, yielding a mono-phosphorylated Kdo-lipid IVA with a parent ion (M - H)- at m/z 1703.9. The identification of the mono-functional H. influenzae Kdo transferase, which is encoded by a KdtA homologue that displays 50% identity to its E. coli counterpart, should facilitate the mechanistic dissection of more complex multi-functional Kdo transferases, like those of E. coli and Chlamydia trachomatis.
TI  - Bacterial aspartic proteinases.
AB  - Regions of genomic DNA encoding putative aspartic proteinase domains were amplified by PCR from the bacterial species, Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae. Expression of each of these DNA fragments resulted in the accumulation of the corresponding recombinant proteins in insoluble aggregates. Each recombinant protein was solubilised, refolded and shown to be able to cleave synthetic peptides that have been extensively used previously as substrates for aspartic proteinases of vertebrate, fungal and retroviral origin. Each activity was completely blocked by the diagnostic aspartic proteinase inhibitor, acetyl-pepstatin. This is thus the first report demonstrating unequivocally that aspartic proteinases may be present in bacteria.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of part of the S10 operon from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans FDC Y4.
AB  - We have cloned and sequenced the 5.2 kb EcoRI fragment that contained part of the S10 operon from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans FDC Y4. The order of the ribosomal protein genes was identical to that of the S10 operon of Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli. The deduced amino acid sequences of ribosomal proteins in this operon displayed significant homologies (65.3%-100%) to those of H. influenzae, E. coli, Yersinia enterocolitica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. Phylogenetic trees obtained for these ribosomal proteins were similar to that obtained for 16S rRNA.
TI  - Effect of lipid modification on the physicochemical, structural, antigenic and immunoprotective properties of Haemophilus influenzae outer membrane protein P6.
AB  - The outer membrane lipoprotein, P6 of Haemophilus influenzae was studied to determine the importance of the native palmitoyl moiety on its physicochemical and immunological properties. A recombinant P6 (rP6) molecule devoid of lipidation signal sequence was expressed in Escherichia coli and its properties were compared to those of the palmitylated protein purified from H. influenzae. The isoelectric point of rP6 was more acidic than that of the native protein and also exhibited less secondary structure than P6 as judged by circular dichroism. However, both forms of P6 induced identical P6-specific antibody titers in guinea pigs when Freund's adjuvant was used. These antisera reacted with a panel of overlapping P6 peptides in a comparable manner and in addition, rabbit antisera raised against the P6 peptides reacted equally well with P6 and rP6. Furthermore, all human convalescent sera tested exhibited similar anti-P6 and anti-rP6 antibody titers. However, rP6 was less immunogenic than P6 when administered either without adjuvant or in alum and when tested in competitive inhibition studies with anti-P6 antibodies, was a less effective inhibitor than native P6, suggesting a diminution in some of the antigenic activity of rP6. In spite of these differences, rP6 was capable of eliciting a protective antibody response against live H. influenzae type b challenge in a modified infant rat model of bacteremia. These findings demonstrate that the non-fatty acylated rP6 could possibily be substituted for native P6 in a vaccine against H. influenzae.
TI  - The lppC gene of Streptococcus equisimilis encodes a lipoprotein that is homologous to the e (P4) outer membrane protein from Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - We report the cloning, sequencing, and analysis of a novel chromosomal gene of Streptococcus equisimilis strain H46A that codes for a membrane lipoprotein, designated LppC. The lppC gene is located 3' adjacent to, and co-oriented with, the unrelated gapC gene that encodes the previously characterized glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Sequencing of lppC revealed an 855-bp open reading frame that predicted a 32.4-kDa polypeptide possessing a potential lipoprotein signal sequence and modification site (VTGC). Signal sequence processing of LppC synthesized in the homologous host or expressed from plasmid pLPP2 in Escherichia coli was sensitive to globomycin, a selective inhibitor of lipoprotein-specific signal peptidase II. Subcellular localization of LppC using polyclonal antibodies raised to the hexahistidyl-tagged protein proved LppC to be tightly associated with the cytoplasmic membrane of S. equisimilis and with the outer membrane of E. coli JM109 (pLPP2). Southern, Northern and Western analyses indicated that lpp was conserved in S. pyogenes, and transcribed independently of gap as monocistronic 0.9-kb mRNA from a sigma 70-like consensus promoter. Database searches found homology of LppC to the hel gene-encoded outer membrane protein e (P4) from Haemophilus influenzae to which it exhibits 58% sequence similarity. However, unlike the hel gene, lppC was unable to complement hemA mutants of E. coli for growth on hemin as sole porphyrin source in aerobic conditions. Furthermore, neither the wild type nor an lppC insertion mutant of S. equisimilis could grow on hemin in iron-limited medium. These results, together with findings indicating that S. equisimilis H46A had no absolute requirement for iron, led us to conclude that lppC, in contrast to hel, is not involved in hemin utilization and has yet to be assigned a function.
TI  - In-vitro activity of trovafloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, against recent clinical isolates.
AB  - Trovafloxacin (CP-99,219) was very active against Gram-negative species examined  including Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Legionella spp., Neisseria spp. and Escherichia coli (MIC90s < or = 0.03 mg/L). In general trovafloxacin was twice as active as ofloxacin but only half as active as ciprofloxacin against Gram-negative species. Trovafloxacin was active against Gram-positive organisms, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90s < or = 0.25 mg/L). Against these organisms activity was eight to 16 times greater for trovafloxacin than for either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. In addition, Chlamydia spp., Mycoplasma spp. and Ureaplasma urealyticum were eight to 16 times more susceptible to trovafloxacin than to either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. These in-vitro data show that trovafloxacin is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone with greater activity against clinically important Gram-positive species compared with ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Compositional biases of bacterial genomes and evolutionary implications.
AB  - We compare and contrast genome-wide compositional biases and distributions of short oligonucleotides across 15 diverse prokaryotes that have substantial genomic sequence collections. These include seven complete genomes (Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803, Methanococcus jannaschii, and Pyrobaculum aerophilum). A key observation concerns the constancy of the dinucleotide relative abundance profiles over multiple 50-kb disjoint contigs within the same genome. (The profile is rhoXY* = fXY*/fX*fY* for all XY, where fX* denotes the frequency of the nucleotide X and fY* denotes the frequency of the dinucleotide XY, both computed from the sequence concatenated with its inverted complementary sequence.) On the basis of this constancy, we refer to the collection [rhoXY*] as the genome signature. We establish that the differences between [rhoXY*] vectors of 50-kb sample contigs of different genomes virtually always exceed the differences between those of the same genomes. Various di- and tetranucleotide biases are identified. In particular, we find that the dinucleotide CpG=CG is underrepresented in many thermophiles (e.g., M. jannaschii, Sulfolobus sp., and M. thermoautotrophicum) but overrepresented in halobacteria. TA is broadly underrepresented in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but normal counts appear in Sulfolobus and P. aerophilum sequences. More than for any other bacterial genome, palindromic tetranucleotides are underrepresented in H. influenzae. The M. jannaschii sequence is unprecedented in its extreme underrepresentation of CTAG tetranucleotides and in the anomalous distribution of CTAG sites around the genome. Comparative analysis of numbers of long tetranucleotide microsatellites distinguishes H. influenzae. Dinucleotide relative abundance differences between bacterial sequences are compared. For example, in these assessments of differences, the cyanobacteria Synechocystis, Synechococcus, and Anabaena do not form a coherent group and are as far from each other as general gram-negative sequences are from general gram-positive sequences. The difference of M. jannaschii from low-G+C gram-positive proteobacteria is one-half of the difference from gram-negative proteobacteria. Interpretations and hypotheses center on the role of the genome signature in highlighting similarities and dissimilarities across different classes of prokaryotic species, possible mechanisms underlying the genome signature, the form and level of genome compositional flux, the use of the genome signature as a chronometer of molecular phylogeny, and implications with respect to the three putative eubacterial, archaeal, and eukaryote domains of life and to the origin and early evolution of eukaryotes.
TI  - Role of the nhaC-encoded Na+/H+ antiporter of alkaliphilic Bacillus firmus OF4.
AB  - Application of protoplast transformation and single- and double-crossover mutagenesis protocols to alkaliphilic Bacillus firmus OF4811M (an auxotrophic strain of B. firmus OF4) facilitated the extension of the sequence of the previously cloned nhaC gene, which encodes an Na+/H+ antiporter, and the surrounding region. The nhaC gene is part of a likely 2-gene operon encompassing nhaC and a small gene that was designated nhaS; the operon is preceded by novel direct repeats. The predicted alkaliphile NhaC, based on the extended sequence analysis, would be a membrane protein with 462 amino acid residues and 12 transmembrane segments that is highly homologous to the deduced products of homologous genes of unknown function from Bacillus subtilis and Haemophilus influenzae. The full-length version of nhaC complemented the Na+-sensitive phenotype of an antiporter-deficient mutant strain of Escherichia coli but not the alkali-sensitive growth phenotypes of Na+/H+-deficient mutants of either alkaliphilic B. firmus OF4811M or B. subtilis. Indeed, NhaC has no required role in alkaliphily, inasmuch as the nhaC deletion strain of B. firmus OF4811M, N13, grew well at pH 10.5 at Na+ concentrations equal to or greater than 10 mM. Even at lower Na+ concentrations, N13 exhibited only a modest growth defect at pH 10.5. This was accompanied by a reduced capacity to acidify the cytoplasm relative to the medium compared to the wild-type strain or to N13 complemented by cloned nhaC. The most notable deficiency observed in N13 was its poor growth at pH 7.5 and Na+ concentrations up to 25 mM. During growth at pH 7.5, NhaC is apparently a major component of the relatively high affinity Na+/H+ antiport activity available to extrude the Na+ and to confer some initial protection in the face of a sudden upshift in external pH, i.e., before full induction of additional antiporters. Consistent with the inference that NhaC is a relatively high affinity, electrogenic Na+/H+ antiporter, N13 exhibited a defect in diffusion potential-energized efflux of 22Na+ from right-side-out membrane vesicles from cells that were preloaded with 2 mM Na+ and energized at pH 7.5. When the experiment was conducted with vesicles loaded with 25 mM Na+, comparable efflux was observed in preparations from all the strains.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic properties of BAY 12-8039 on gram-positive and gram-negative organisms as demonstrated by studies of time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  - Time-kill kinetics of BAY 12-8039 were studied at two inocula against three strains each of Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The postantibiotic effects of BAY 12-8039 were studied on three strains each of E. coli, S. aureus, H. influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The pharmacodynamic data demonstrated that BAY 12-8039 has marked activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions) and anaerobes. BAY 12-8039 also exhibited a postantibiotic effect of >1 h for all strains except one E. coli strain.
TI  - In vitro activity of HSR-903, a new quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new fluoroquinolone HSR-903 was compared with those  of ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin. HSR-903 inhibited 90% of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clinical isolates at 0.78 and 1.56 microg/ml, respectively, and its activity against MRSA was 16-fold higher than those of sparfloxacin and levofloxacin and 64-fold higher than that of ciprofloxacin. The MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90s) of HSR-903 for Streptococcus pyogenes and penicillin G-susceptible and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) were 0.10, 0.05, and 0.05 microg/ml, respectively. Against PRSP, the activity of HSR-903 was 4-fold higher than that of sparfloxacin and 32- to 256-fold higher than those of the other quinolones. The MIC90 of HSR-903 for Enterococcus faecalis was 0.20 microg/ml, and HSR-903 was more active than the other quinolones against enterococci. The activity of HSR-903 against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly similar to that of ciprofloxacin and greater than those of the other quinolones. Against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Helicobacter pylori, HSR-903 was the most potent of the quinolones tested. The activity of HSR-903 was not affected by the medium, the inoculum size, or the addition of serum, but decreased under acidic conditions, as did those of the other quinolones tested. HSR-903 exhibited rapid bactericidal action and had a good postantibiotic effect on S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. HSR-903 inhibited supercoiling by DNA gyrase from Escherichia coli, but it was much less active against human topoisomerase II.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DU-6681a, a parent compound of novel oral carbapenem DZ-2640.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of DU-6681a, a parent compound of DZ-2640, against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was compared with those of penems and cephalosporins currently available. MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90s) of the compound for clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains, were 0.10, 25, and 12.5 microg/ml, respectively. DU-6681a inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and of penicillin-susceptible and -insusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.006, 0.025, and 0.20 microg/ml, respectively, and MIC90s of the compound were 6.25 and >100 microg/ml for Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, respectively. MIC90s of DU-6681a were 0.20, 0.10, and 0.025 microg/ml for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, respectively. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MIC50 and MIC90 of DU-6681a were 25 and 50 microg/ml, respectively. DU-6681a activity was not affected by different media, varied inoculum size (10(4) to 10(7) CFU), or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions against gram-negative bacteria, under alkaline conditions against gram-positive bacteria, and in human urine, as was the activity of the other antibiotics tested. The frequency of spontaneous resistance to DU-6681a was less than or equal to those of the reference compounds. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated the bactericidal action of DU-6681a against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and H. influenzae.
TI  - Plasmid maintenance functions of the large virulence plasmid of Shigella flexneri.
AB  - The large virulence plasmid pMYSH6000 of Shigella flexneri contains a replicon and a plasmid maintenance stability determinant (Stb) on adjacent SalI fragments. The presence of a RepFIIA replicon on the SalI C fragment was confirmed, and the complete sequence of the adjacent SalI O fragment was determined. It shows homology to part of the transfer (tra) operon of the F plasmid. Stb stabilizes a partition-defective P1 miniplasmid in Escherichia coli. A 1.1-kb region containing a homolog of the F trbH gene was sufficient to confer stability. However, the trbH open reading frame could be interrupted without impairing stability. Deletion analysis implicated the involvement of two small open reading frames, STBORF1 and STBORF2, that fully overlap trbH in the opposite direction. These open reading frames are closely related to the vagC and vagD genes of the Salmonella dublin virulence plasmid and to open reading frame pairs in the F trbH region and in the chromosomes of Dichelobacter nodosus and Haemophilus influenzae. Stb appears to promote better-than-random distribution of plasmid copies and is a plasmid incompatibility determinant. The F homolog does not itself confer stability but exerts incompatibility against the activity of the Stb system. Stb is likely to encode either an active partition system or a postsegregational killing system. It shows little similarity to previously studied plasmid stability loci, but the genetic organization of STBORF1 and STBORF2 resembles that of postsegregational killing mechanisms.
TI  - The Helicobacter pylori ureC gene codes for a phosphoglucosamine mutase.
AB  - The function of UreC, the product of a 1,335-bp-long open reading frame upstream  from the urease structural genes (ureAB) of Helicobacter pylori, was investigated. We present data showing that the ureC gene product is a phosphoglucosamine mutase. D. Mengin-Lecreulx and J. van Heijenoort (J. Biol. Chem. 271:32-39, 1996) observed that UreC is similar (43% identity) to the GlmM protein of Escherichia coli. Those authors showed that GlmM is a phosphoglucosamine mutase catalyzing interconversion of glucosamine-6-phosphate into glucosamine-1-phosphate, which is subsequently transformed into UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. The latter product is one of the main cytoplasmic precursors of cell wall peptidoglycan and outer membrane lipopolysaccharides. The present paper reports that, like its E. coli homolog glmM, the H. pylori ureC gene is essential for cell growth. It was known that growth of a lethal conditional glmM mutant of E. coli at a nonpermissive temperature can be restored in the presence of the ureC gene. We showed that complete complementation of the glmM mutant can be obtained with a plasmid overproducing UreC. The peptidoglycan content and the specific phosphoglucosamine mutase activity of such a complemented strain were measured; these results demonstrated that the ureC gene product functions as a phosphoglucosamine mutase. Homologs of the UreC and GlmM proteins were identified in Haemophilus influenzae, Mycobacterium leprae, Clostridium perfringens, Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803, and Methanococcus jannaschii. Significant conservation of the amino acid sequence of these proteins in such diverse organisms suggests a very ancient common ancestor for the genes and defines a consensus motif for the phosphoglucosamine mutase active site. We propose renaming the H. pylori ureC gene the glmM gene.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a DNA region involved in the export of capsular polysaccharide by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 5a.
AB  - Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae synthesizes a serotype-specific capsular polysaccharide that acts as a protective barrier to phagocytosis and complement-mediated killing. To begin understanding the role of A. pleuropneumoniae capsule in virulence, we sought to identify the genes involved in capsular polysaccharide export and biosynthesis. A 5.3-kb XbaI fragment of A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 5a J45 genomic DNA that hybridized with DNA probes specific for the Haemophilus influenzae type b cap export region was cloned and sequenced. This A. pleuropneumoniae DNA fragment encoded four open reading frames, designated cpxDCBA. The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of cpxDCBA contained a high degree of homology to the capsule export genes of H. influenzae type b bexDCBA, Neisseria meningitidis group B ctrABCD, and, to a lesser extent, Escherichia coli K1 and K5 kpsE and kpsMT. When present in trans, the cpxDCBA gene cluster complemented kpsM::TnphoA or kpsT::TnphoA mutations, determined by enzyme immunoassay and by restored sensitivity to a K5-specific bacteriophage. A cpxCB probe hybridized to genomic DNA from all A. pleuropneumoniae serotypes tested, indicating that this DNA was conserved among serotypes. These data suggest that A. pleuropneumoniae produces a group II family capsule similar to those of related mucosal pathogens.
TI  - Porins of Haemophilus influenzae type b mutated in loop 3 and in loop 4.
AB  - Porin (341 amino acids; mass of 37,782 Da) in the outer membrane of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) permits diffusion into the periplasm of small solutes up to a molecular mass of 1400 Da. Molecular modeling of Hib porin identified its structural similarities to OmpF of Escherichia coli and disclosed for Hib porin a shorter length of loop 3 and a longer length of loop 4. By site-directed mutagenesis of the porin gene ompP2, mutant porins were constructed to contain 6 or 12 amino acid deletions either in loop 3 or in surface-exposed loop 4. Wild type Hib porin and mutant porins were expressed in a nontypeable H. influenzae strain deleted for the ompP2 gene. The mutant porins were purified and reconstituted into planar bilayers, tested for channel formation and compared with wild type Hib porin. Mutant Haemophilus porin possessing a 6-amino acid deletion in loop 3 displayed a broad distribution of single channel conductance values, while deletion of 12 amino acids from the same loop destabilized the porin channel. By comparison, deletion of 6 or of 12 amino acids from loop 4 of Hib porin resulted in an increased single channel conductance (1.15 and 1.05 nanosiemens, respectively) compared with wild type Hib porin (0. 85 nanosiemens). The C3 epitope of the poliovirus VP1 capsid protein was inserted either into loop 3 or into loop 4 of Hib porin. By flow cytometry, the C3 epitope was detected as surface-exposed in strains expressing C3 insertion in loop 4; in strains expressing C3 insertion in loop 3, the epitope was inaccessible. We propose that loop 4 of Hib porin, although surface-accessible, is oriented toward the central axis of the pore and that deletions in this loop increase the single channel conductance by widening the pore entrance.
TI  - Characteristic enrichment of DNA repeats in different genomes.
AB  - Using computer programs developed for this purpose, we searched for various repeated sequences including inverted, direct tandem, and homopurine-homopyrimidine mirror repeats in various prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and an archaebacterium. Comparison of observed frequencies with expectations revealed that in bacterial genomes and organelles the frequency of different repeats is either random or enriched for inverted and/or direct tandem repeats. By contrast, in all eukaryotic genomes studied, we observed an overrepresentation of all repeats, especially homopurine-homopyrimidine mirror repeats. Analysis of the genomic distribution of all abundant repeats showed that they are virtually excluded from coding sequences. Unexpectedly, the frequencies of abundant repeats normalized for their expectations were almost perfect exponential functions of their size, and for a given repeat this function was indistinguishable between different genomes.
TI  - Membrane localization, topology, and mutual stabilization of the rnfABC gene products in Rhodobacter capsulatus and implications for a new family of energy-coupling NADH oxidoreductases.
AB  - The rnf genes in Rhodobacter capsulatus are unique nitrogen fixation genes that encode potential membrane proteins (RnfA, RnfD, and RnfE) and potential iron-sulfur proteins (RnfB and RnfC). In this study, we first analyzed the localization and topology of the RnfA, RnfB, and RnfC proteins. By activity and immunoblot analysis of expression of translational fusions to Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase, RnfA protein was shown to span the chromatophore membrane with its odd-numbered hydrophilic regions exposed to periplasm. By alkaline treatment of membrane fractions and following immunoblot analysis using antibodies against recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli, both RnfB and RnfC proteins were revealed to situate at the periphery of the chromatophore membranes. Second, mutual interaction of the Rnf proteins was analyzed by immunochemical determinations of RnfB and RnfC proteins in rnf mutants and their complemented derivatives. The contents in cellular fractions indicated that RnfB and RnfC stabilize each other and that the presence of RnfA is necessary for stable existence of both proteins. These results support a hypothesis that the Rnf products are subunits of a membrane complex. Finally, we detected homologs of rnf genes in Haemophilus influenzae and Vibrio alginolyticus by data base searches and in E. coli by cloning of a fragment of an rnfA homolog followed by a data base search. Close comparisons revealed that RnfC has potential binding sites for NADH and FMN which are similar to those found in proton-translocating NADH:quinone oxidoreductases and that RnfA, RnfD, and RnfE show similarity to subunits of sodium-translocating NADH:quinone oxidoreductases. We predict that the putative Rnf complex represents a novel family of energy-coupling NADH oxidoreductases.
TI  - Characterization of BpH3, an H-NS-like protein in Bordetella pertussis.
AB  - This study describes the characterization of BpH3, a Bordetella pertussis DNA-binding protein. Sequence analysis reveals significant homology with the H-NS sequence of Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae, particularly in the C-terminal part of the proteins. Our results provide evidence that H-NS and BpH3 display functional homology. First, expression of BpH3 in an hns mutant results in restoration of motility, an H-NS-dependent phenotype. This effect is dependent on the level of BpH3 expression and results from transcriptional activation of the flagellar master operon. Second, the high level of beta-glucosidase associated with hns mutations is reversed to the low wild-type level in the presence of BpH3. Third, BpH3 is able, like H-NS, to preferentially bind in vitro to curved DNA fragments, such as flhDC and bla promoter regions. Our results are the first demonstration that proteins homologous to H-NS exist in bacteria phylogenetically distant from H. influenzae and enterobacteria.
TI  - EspP, a novel extracellular serine protease of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 cleaves human coagulation factor V.
AB  - In this study, we identified and characterized a novel secreted protein, the extracellular serine protease EspP, which is encoded by the large plasmid of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7. The corresponding espP gene consists of a 3900 bp open reading frame that is able to encode a 1300-amino-acid protein. EspP is synthesized as a large precursor which is then processed at the N- and C-termini during secretion. It can be grouped into the autotransporter protein family. The deduced amino acid sequence of EspP showed homology to several secreted or surface-exposed proteins of pathogenic bacteria, in particular EspC of enteropathogenic E. coli and IgA1 proteases from Neisseria spp. and Haemophilus influenzae. Hybridization experiments and immunoblot analysis of clinical EHEC isolates showed that EspP is widespread among EHEC of the serogroup O157 and that it also exists in serogroup 026. A specific immune response against EspP was detected in sera from patients suffering from EHEC infections. Functional analysis showed that EspP is a protease capable of cleaving pepsin A and human coagulation factor V. Degradation of factor V could contribute to the mucosal haemorrhage observed in patients with haemorrhagic colitis.
TI  - Blood-brain barrier permeability during the development of experimental bacterial meningitis in the rat.
AB  - In an attempt to examine whether routes of bacterial entry into the central nervous system have any bearing on subsequent changes in blood-brain barrier permeability, we examined cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration of circulating 125I-albumin in two different models of experimental meningitis due to K1 Escherichia coli, type III group B streptococcus, or Haemophilus influenzae type b in infant rats: hematogenous meningitis subsequent to subcutaneous inoculation of bacteria vs meningitis induced by direct inoculation of bacteria into the CSF via the cisterna magna. In the model of hematogenous meningitis, the mean CSF penetration was significantly greater in animals with H. influenzae type b meningitis than in those with meningitis due to K1 E. coli or type III group B streptococcus. In contrast, the mean CSF penetration was significantly enhanced in all animals with meningitis induced by intracisternal inoculation regardless of infecting pathogens. Tumor necrosis factor activity in CSF appeared to correlate with the functional penetration of circulating albumin across the blood-brain barrier in both models of experimental meningitis. These findings suggest that the alterations of blood-brain barrier permeability during development of experimental meningitis may vary for different models of inducing meningitis and that the mechanisms responsible for these different permeability changes may be multifactorial.
TI  - Purification and characterization of flavoproteins and cytochromes from the yellow bioluminescence marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri strain Y1.
AB  - Several flavoproteins and cytochromes that occur as major components in extracts  of the yellow bioluminescence Y1 strain of the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri have been purified and characterized with respect to their mass (SDS/PAGE and matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization MS), chromatographic properties, N-terminal sequence, and spectroscopy (absorption, fluorescence emission and anisotropy decay). The investigated proteins were as follows: yellow fluorescence protein (YFP) with bound riboflavin, FMN or 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine; a blue fluorescence protein (BFP) with bound 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine, riboflavin, or 6-methyl-7-oxo-8-ribityllumazine; thioredoxin reductase with FAD as ligand; and two c-type diheme cytochromes, c551 and c554. We present evidence that the riboflavin-bound YFP has an N-terminal sequence corresponding to that published for the dimeric YFP. We show that an equilibrium replacement of the riboflavin can be made with excess lumazine derivative and that lumazine-bound YFP has different bioluminescence properties to those of the lumazine protein from Photobacterium leiognathi. BFP is a different protein again, and in the bacterial lysate it occurs in multiple forms, ligated to either riboflavin, lumazine, or the 7-oxolumazine derivative. The N-terminal sequence for BFP shows similarities to those of the YFP proteins and to lumazine protein and riboflavin synthase from Photobacterium. BFP in any form has no bioluminescence or riboflavin-synthase activity. A 70-kDa fluorescent flavoprotein with FAD as ligand has an N-terminal sequence highly similar to those of thioredoxin reductases from Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli. Cytochrome contaminations in previous preparations of YFP have been removed and are identified as the two c-type cytochromes c551 and c554. Both inhibit the NADH-induced bioluminescence in the reductase/luciferase system with the luciferases from P. leiognathi and V. fischeri. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the cytochrome (c551) corresponds to a diheme cytochrome c4. The spectral properties of c554 are similar to those of other c5 cytochromes, and both c554 and c551 have absorption spectra similar to those of the respective cytochromes from the gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas and Azotobacter.
TI  - Molecular and immunological characterization of OprL, the 18 kDa outer-membrane peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (PAL) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Immunological screening of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa cosmid library led to the identification of clones producing an 18 kDa outer-membrane protein. This protein reacted in Western blots with a polyclonal antiserum against outer-membrane proteins of P. aeruginosa and with a monoclonal antibody (MA1-6) specific for OprL, the peptidoglycan-associated outer-membrane lipoprotein (PAL). Sequencing of pOML7, a subclone expressing oprL, revealed an ORF of 504 bp encoding a polypeptide with a typical lipoprotein signal recognition sequence. Another ORF was found upstream of oprL, with homology to the TolB protein of Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae. Downstream of oprL, a second ORF, of 321 bp, was found (orf2), encoding a protein with a signal peptide and with no homology with proteins of known biological function. After the stop codon of orf2, a rho-independent terminator sequence was detected which is part of the P. aeruginosa PAO1 insertion element IS222. OprL showed homologies with all known PALs from Gram-negative bacteria, especially in the C-terminal part. mAb MA1-6 reacted with P. aeruginosa cells in immunofluorescence, and with E. coli cells expressing oprL, which had an abnormal, elongated morphology, an indication that production of the protein perturbed the division process.
TI  - Big time for small genomes.
AB  
TI  - The ispB gene encoding octaprenyl diphosphate synthase is essential for growth of Escherichia coli.
AB  - The Escherichia coli ispB gene encoding octaprenyl diphosphate synthase is responsible for the synthesis of the side chain of isoprenoid quinones. We tried to construct an E. coli ispB-disrupted mutant but could not isolate the chromosomal ispB disrupted mutant unless the ispB gene or its homolog was supplied on a plasmid. The chromosomal ispB disruptants that harbored plasmids carrying the ispB homologs from Haemophilus influenzae and Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803 produced mainly ubiquinone 7 and ubiquinone 9, respectively. Our results indicate that the function of the ispB gene is essential for normal growth and that this function can be substituted for by homologs of the ispB gene from other organisms that produce distinct forms of ubiquinone.
TI  - Identification of greA encoding a transcriptional elongation factor as a member of the carA-orf-carB-greA operon in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1.
AB  - A homolog of the transcriptional elongation factor, GreA, was identified in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. The deduced amino acid sequence for GreA from this organism exhibits 65.2% identity to its counterpart in Escherichia coli K-12. The nucleotide sequence of greA from P. aeruginosa overlaps by four bases the 3' terminus of carB which encodes the large subunit of carbamoylphosphate synthetase. S1 nuclease experiments showed that level of the greA transcript is elevated approximately 10-fold under conditions of pyrimidine limitation, consistent with the conclusion that transcription is initiated from the previously identified pyrimidine-sensitive promoter upstream of the carA-orf-carB-greA operon. Transcriptional fusion experiments showed the presence of an additional weak promoter within the carB sequence. A greA insertional mutant of Pseudomonas aerugionsa was constructed by gene replacement. The mutant derivative grew well in rich medium but did not grow in minimal medium supplemented by arginine and nucleosides. The greA phenotype was suppressed by secondary mutations at a relatively high rate, consistent with the notion of an important physiological role for GreA.
TI  - Identification and characterization of ssb and uup mutants with increased frequency of precise excision of transposon Tn10 derivatives: nucleotide sequence of uup in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A Lac+ papillation assay was used to identify mutants (tex) of Escherichia coli that exhibit an increased frequency of precise excision of a lacZ::Tn10dKan insertion. Three tex strains had suffered mutations in the gene (ssb) encoding the essential single-stranded DNA-binding protein SSB, which resulted in the following alterations in the 177-residue protein: G4D; L10F, P24S; and V102M. The phenotypes of these ssb mutants indicated that they were largely unaffected in other functions mediated by SSB, such as DNA replication, recombination, and repair. Strains with multicopy ssb+ exhibited a decreased frequency of Tn10dKan precise excision. Three other tex mutants had insertion mutations in the locus designated uup at 21.75 min on the linkage map. The nucleotide sequence of uup was determined, and the gene was inferred to encode a 625-amino-acid hydrophilic protein that belongs to the superfamily of ABC-domain proteins (with two pairs of the Walker A and B motifs), which are postulated to be involved in coupling ATP hydrolysis with other biological processes. The uup gene product shares extensive homology with the deduced sequences of two proteins of Haemophilus influenzae. The uup gene is also situated immediately upstream of (and is transcribed in the same direction as) the paraquat-inducible SoxRS-regulated pqi-5 gene, two reported promoters for which are situated within the uup coding sequence.
TI  - Scavengase p20: a novel family of bacterial antioxidant enzymes.
AB  - A novel antioxidant enzyme designated scavengase p20 was identified in various pathogenic bacteria through database searching for sequences strikingly homologous to a recently discovered Escherichia coli thiol peroxidase p20. The direct biochemical evidence for the existence of scavengase p20 in Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Helicobacter pylori was provided by protein microsequencing and by in vitro assays for antioxidant activities. Overlapping genes encoding scavengase p20 and superoxide dismutase were recognized in H. pylori and their functional implications are discussed.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and expression of rat liver 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase.
AB  - Rat liver d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase was purified to homogeneity and digested with trypsin, and the sequences of two peptides were determined. This sequence information was used to screen a rat hepatoma cDNA library. Among 11 positive clones, two covered the whole coding sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence (533 residues; Mr 56493) shared closer similarity with Bacillus subtilis 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase than with the enzymes from Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In all cases the similarity was most apparent in the substrate- and NAD+-binding domains, and low or insignificant in the C-terminal domain. A corresponding 2.1 kb mRNA was present in rat tissues including kidney, brain and testis, whatever the dietary status, and also in livers of animals fed a protein-free, carbohydrate-rich diet, but not in livers of control rats, suggesting transcriptional regulation. The full-length rat 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase was expressed in E. coli and purified. The recombinant enzyme and the protein purified from liver displayed hyperbolic kinetics with respect to 3-phosphoglycerate, NAD+ and NADH, but substrate inhibition by 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate was observed; this inhibition was antagonized by salts. Similar properties were observed with a truncated form of 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase lacking the C-terminal domain, indicating that the latter is not implicated in substrate inhibition or in salt effects. By contrast with the bacterial enzyme, rat 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase did not catalyse the reduction of 2-oxoglutarate, indicating that this enzyme is not involved in human D- or L-hydroxyglutaric aciduria.
TI  - Structure-function relationships within the peptide deformylase family. Evidence  for a conserved architecture of the active site involving three conserved motifs and a metal ion.
AB  - Thermus thermophilus peptide deformylase was characterized. Its enzymatic properties as well as its organization in domains proved to share close resemblances with those of the Escherichia coli enzyme despite few sequence identities. In addition to the HEXXH signature sequence of the zinc metalloprotease family, a second short stretch of strictly conserved amino acids was noticed, EGCLS, the cysteine of which corresponds to the third zinc ligand. The study of site-directed mutants of the E. coli deformylase shows that the residues of this stretch are crucial for the structure and/or catalytic efficiency of the active enzyme. Both aforementioned sequences were used as markers of the peptide deformylase family in protein sequence databases. Seven sequences coming from Haemophilus influenzae, Lactococcus lactis, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Bacillus subtilus and Synechocystis sp. could be identified. The characterization of the product of the open reading frame from B. stearothermophilus confirmed that it actually corresponded to a peptide deformylase with properties similar to those of the E. coli enzyme. Alignment of the nine peptide deformylase sequences showed that, in addition to the two above sequences, only a third one, GXGXAAXQ, is strictly conserved. This motif is also located in the active site according to the three-dimensional structure of the E. coli enzyme. Site-directed variants of E. coli peptide deformylase showed the involvement of the corresponding residues for maintaining an active and stable enzyme. Altogether, these data allow us to propose that the three identified conserved motifs of peptide deformylases build up the active site around a metal ion. Finally, an analysis of the location of the other conserved residues, in particular of the hydrophobic ones, was performed using the three-dimensional model of the E. coli enzyme. This enables us to suggest that all bacterial peptide deformylases adopt a constant overall tertiary structure.
TI  - Characterization of a large transferrin-binding protein from Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 7.
AB  - The binding of transferrin at the surface of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (A.  pp.) is mediated by two proteins of approximately 60 and 100 kDa. The 60 kDa protein has been shown to be highly divergent among different serotypes and to induce a serotype-specific protective immune response. In this study we have characterized the 100 kDa transferrin-binding protein of A. pp. serotype 7 and designated it as TfbB. The tfbB gene was found to be located immediately downstream of the tfbA gene. It was cloned and sequenced, and antibodies raised against the isolated recombinant protein detected, with a constant intensity, a 100 kDa protein in A. pp. serotypes 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11, and a polypeptide of approximately 103 kDa in serotypes 1, 3, 5A and 12. In addition, comparative analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence showed more than 40% identity with the large transferrin-binding proteins of Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae. The TfbB protein was expressed in E. coli outer membranes in a conformation eliciting porcine transferrin-specific binding activity. Sera of pigs immunized with these TfbB-containing E. coli membranes recognized functional membrane-associated TfbB protein whereas no such reaction was observed upon immunization with isolated recombinant TfbB protein. A preliminary animal experiment showed that TfbB-containing outer membrane preparations from recombinant E. coli can reduce significantly the mortality of an A.pp. infection with the homologous strain.
TI  - Structure and gene-polypeptide relationships of the region encoding glycerol diffusion facilitator (glpF) and glycerol kinase (glpK) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The glycerol facilitator is one of the few known examples of bacterial solute transport proteins that catalyse facilitated diffusion across the cytoplasmic membrane. A second protein, glycerol kinase, is involved in entry of external glycerol into cellular metabolism by trapping glycerol in the cytoplasm as sn-glycerol 3-phosphate. Evidence is presented that glycerol transport in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is mediated by a similar transport system. The genes encoding the glycerol facilitator, glpF, and glycerol kinase, glpK, were isolated on a 4.5 kb EcoRI fragment from a chromosomal mini-library by functional complementation of an Escherichia coli glpK mutant after establishing a map of the chromosomal glpFK region with the help of a PCR-amplified glpK segment. The nucleotide sequence revealed that glpF is the promoter-proximal gene of the glpFK operon. The glycerol facilitator and glycerol kinase were identified in a T7 expression system as proteins with apparent molecular masses of 25 and 56 kDa, respectively. The identities of the glycerol facilitator and glycerol kinase amino acid sequences with their counterparts from Escherichia coli were 70 and 81%, respectively; this similarity extended to two homologues in the genome sequence of Haemophilus influenzae. A chromosomal delta glpFK mutant was isolated by gene replacement. This mutant no longer transported glycerol and could no longer utilize it as sole carbon and energy source. Two ORFs, orfX and orfY, encoding a putative regulatory protein and a carbohydrate kinase of unknown function, were located upstream of the glpFK operon.
TI  - Identification of the ADP-L-glycero-D-manno-heptose-6-epimerase (rfaD) and heptosyltransferase II (rfaF) biosynthesis genes from nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae 2019.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae is an important human pathogen. The lipooligosaccharide (LOS) of H. influenzae has been implicated as a virulence determinant. To better understand the assembly of LOS in nontypeable H. influenzae (NtHi), we have cloned and characterized the rfaD and rfaF genes of NtHi 2019, which encode the ADP-L-glycero-D-manno-heptose-6-epimerase and heptosyltransferase II enzymes, respectively. This cloning was accomplished by the complementation of Salmonella typhimurium lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis gene mutants. These deep rough mutants are novobiocin susceptible until complemented with the appropriate gene. In this manner, we are able to use novobiocin resistance to select for specific NtHi LOS inner core biosynthesis genes. Such a screening system yielded a plasmid with a 4.8-kb insert. This plasmid was able to complement both rfaD and rfaF mutants of S. typhimurium. The LPS of these complemented strains appeared identical to the wild-type Salmonella LPS. The genes encoding the rfaD and rfaF genes from NtHi 2019 were sequenced and found to be similar to the analogous genes from S. typhimurium and Escherichia coli. The rfaD gene encodes a polypeptide of 35 kDa and the rfaF encodes a protein of 39 kDa, as demonstrated by in vitro transcription-translation studies. Isogenic mutants which demonstrated truncated LOS consistent with inner core biosynthesis mutants were constructed in the NtHi strain 2019. Primer extension analysis demonstrated the presence of a strong promoter upstream of rfaD but suggested only a very weak promoter upstream of rfaF. Complementation studies, however, suggest that the rfaF gene does have an independent promoter. Mass spectrometric analysis shows that the LOS molecules expressed by H. influenzae rfaD and rfaF mutant strains have identical molecular masses. Additional studies verified that in the rfaD mutant strain, D-glycero-D-manno-heptose is added to the LOS molecule in place of the usual L-glycero-D-manno-heptose. Finally, the genetic organizations of the inner core biosynthesis genes of S. typhimurium, E. coli, and several strains of H. influenzae were examined, and substantial differences were uncovered.
TI  - Frequency of low level bacteremia in infants from birth to two months of age.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The frequency of low level bacteremia (< or = 10 colony-forming units/ml) in infants from birth to 2 months of age and the optimal volume of blood and number of blood cultures to be collected have not been well-documented. During 1991 guidelines at this hospital for collection of blood for culture from these infants were revised. METHODS: Blood from each infant with suspected bacteremia was usually inoculated into an Isolator 1.5 Microbial Tube (1.5 ml of blood) and a bottle of anaerobic broth (0.5 to 3.0 ml of blood). The use of a second Isolator tube and the total blood volume recommended for culture (2 to 6 ml) depended on the weight and total blood volume of each infant. RESULTS: Forty-four bacterial pathogens were recovered from the blood of 40 (2.5%) of 1589 infants. Of 34 infants from whose blood the concentration of pathogens could be determined, 23 (68%) had low level bacteremia. Of 50 isolates of pathogens recovered from Isolator cultures, 32 (64%) were detected in counts of < or = 10 colony-forming units/ml. When 2 or 3 blood culture devices were inoculated with a total of 2 to 6 ml of blood from each infant, significantly more cases of bacteremia were detected (34 (3.0%) of 1126 infants had positive blood cultures) than when only one culture device containing < or = 1.5 ml of blood was used (2 (0.5%) of 398 infants had positive blood cultures; P = 0.008). However, when 4 or more culture devices were inoculated with a total of > 6 ml of blood from each infant (5 (7.7%) of 65 infants had positive blood cultures), the difference in recovery of pathogens compared with the culturing of from 2 to 6 ml of blood per infant was not significant (P = 0.089). CONCLUSIONS: Low level bacteremia was common in our infants' patient population. The culturing of up to 6 ml of blood which represented up to 4.5% of an infant's total blood volume was required for detection of the pathogens.
TI  - aarC, an essential gene involved in density-dependent regulation of the 2'-N-acetyltransferase in Providencia stuartii.
AB  - The 2'-N-acetyltransferase [AAC(2')-Ia] in Providencia stuartii has a dual function where it is involved in the acetylation of peptidoglycan and certain aminoglycosides. A search for negative regulators of the aac(2')-Ia gene has resulted in the identification of aarC. A missense allele (aarC1) resulted in an 8.9-fold increase in beta-galactosidase accumulation from an aac(2')-lacZ transcriptional fusion. Northern blot analysis demonstrated an increase in aac(2')-Ia mRNA accumulation that was specific to cells at high density. In addition, the aarC1 allele also resulted in a substantial increase in the expression of aarP, a transcriptional activator of the aac(2')-Ia gene. The wild-type aarC gene was isolated by complementation and encodes a predicted protein of 365 amino acids with a molecular mass of 39,815 Da. The predicted AarC protein exhibited 88% amino acid homology to the previously identified GcpE protein of Escherichia coli and 86% homology to a gene product from Haemophilus influenzae. The E. coli gcpE gene was able to functionally complement the aarC1 allele in P. stuartii. The aarC1 allele was identified as a T to G transversion that resulted in a valine to glycine substitution at position 136 in the AarC protein. The aarC gene appears to be essential for cell viability as construction of a disrupted copy (aarC::lacZ) was possible only in cells that carried an episomal copy of aarC or gcpE.
TI  - Sequence analysis and characterization of a 40-kilodalton Borrelia hermsii glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase homolog.
AB  - We report the purification, molecular cloning, and characterization of a 40-kDa glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase homolog from Borrelia hermsii. The 40-kDa protein was solubilized from whole organisms with 0.1% Triton X-100, phase partitioned into the Triton X-114 detergent phase, and purified by fast-performance liquid chromatography (FPLC). The gene encoding the 40-kDa protein was cloned from a B. hermsii chromosomal DNA lambda EXlox expression library and identified by using affinity antibodies generated against the purified native protein. The deduced amino acid sequence included a 20-amino-acid signal peptide encoding a putative leader peptidase II cleavage site, indicating that the 40-kDa protein was a lipoprotein. Based on significant homology (31 to 52% identity) of the 40-kDa protein to glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterases of Escherichia coli (GlpQ), Bacillus subtilis (GlpQ), and Haemophilus influenzae (Hpd; protein D), we have designated this B. hermsii 40-kDa lipoprotein a glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase (Gpd) homolog, the first B. hermsii lipoprotein to have a putative functional assignment. A nonlipidated form of the Gpd homolog was overproduced as a fusion protein in E. coli BL21(DE3)(pLysE) and was used to immunize rabbits to generate specific antiserum. Immunoblot analysis with anti-Gpd serum recognized recombinant H. influenzae protein D, and conversely, antiserum to H. influenzae protein D recognized recombinant B. hermsii Gpd (rGpd), indicating antigenic conservation between these proteins. Antiserum to rGpd also identified native Gpd as a constituent of purified outer membrane vesicles prepared from B. hermsii. Screening of other pathogenic spirochetes with anti-rGpd serum revealed the presence of antigenically related proteins in Borrelia burgdorferi, Treponema pallidum, and Leptospira kirschneri. Further sequence analysis both upstream and downstream of the Gpd homolog showed additional homologs of glycerol metabolism, including a glycerol-3-phosphate transporter (GlpT), a glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GlpD), and a thioredoxin reductase (TrxB).
TI  - Characterization of an ATP-dependent DNA ligase encoded by Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - We report that Haemophilus influenzae encodes a 268 amino acid ATP-dependent DNA  ligase. The specificity of Haemophilus DNA ligase was investigated using recombinant protein produced in Escherichia coli. The enzyme catalyzed efficient strand joining on a singly nicked DNA in the presence of magnesium and ATP (Km = 0.2 microM). Other nucleoside triphosphates or deoxynucleoside triphosphates could not substitute for ATP. Haemophilus ligase reacted with ATP in the absence of DNA substrate to form a covalent ligase-adenylate intermediate. This nucleotidyl transferase reaction required a divalent cation and was specific for ATP. The Haemophilus enzyme is the first example of an ATP-dependent DNA ligase encoded by a eubacterial genome. It is also the smallest member of the covalent nucleotidyl transferase superfamily, which includes the bacteriophage and eukaryotic ATP-dependent polynucleotide ligases and the GTP-dependent RNA capping enzymes.
TI  - The alternative sigma factor sigmaB in Staphylococcus aureus: regulation of the sigB operon in response to growth phase and heat shock
AB  - In the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, many proteins involved in the infection process are preferentially produced during the stationary growth phase. Using a DNA probe corresponding to the Bacillus subtilis gene encoding the stationary-phase sigma factor SigB (sigmaB), we identified a gene in S. aureus with similarity to B. subtilis sigB. The sigB region was mapped on the SmaI I fragment of the S. aureus chromosome and contains a total of six open reading frames (orf1-6). The deduced amino acid sequences of orf2, orf3, orf4, and orf5 show 64, 67, 71, and 77% similarity to the B. subtilis proteins RsbU, RsbV, RsbW, and SigB, respectively, with SigB representing the sigma factor and the Rsb proteins representing regulators of sigma B. Furthermore, the relative position of the corresponding genes is conserved in B. subtilis, which strongly suggests that we identified the sigB operon of S. aureus, encoding an alternative sigma factor in this organism. The proposed gene products of the two remaining open reading frames show 48-62% similarity to the PemK, ChpAK, and ChpBK growth inhibitors of Escherichia coli (ORF1) and 61% similarity to the ribosomal protein S1 of Haemophilus influenzae (ORF6). Northern blot analysis of the sigB region in S. aureus revealed that four different transcripts are expressed under different conditions of growth phase and stress. These results indicate a complex transcriptional regulation that differs between S. aureus and B. subtilis.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance: implications for managing respiratory failure.
AB  - The prevalence of antibiotic resistance in respiratory pathogens is increasing rapidly. In the community, resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics has escalated dramatically among Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Resistance to penicillin among S. pneumoniae has developed at an alarming rate over the past two decades. Recent studies in the United States have cited rates of penicillin resistance as high as 23.6%, with 9.5% exhibiting high-level resistance. Many of these strains are resistant to multiple antibiotics. Antimicrobial resistance in hospital-acquired pathogens is a problem, which in large part reflects patterns of antibiotic use. Antimicrobial resistance may arise via multiple mechanisms. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli have become increasingly resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, including imipenem. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases are seen with increasing frequency in Enterobacteriaceae, primarily Klebsiella spp. Fluoroquinolone resistance has increased in P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus and has now been identified in Escherichia coli isolated from hematology wards. Excessive use of antibiotics may promote the emergence and spread of resistant microorganisms. Rigorous infection control measures and modification of antibiotic use patterns may limit or reduce the prevalence of resistant organisms.
TI  - Probing protein function using a combination of gene knockout and proteome analysis by mass spectrometry.
AB  - Recently the determination of the genome sequences of three procaryotes (Haemophilus influenzae, Methanococcus jannaschii and Mycoplasma genitalium) as well as the first eucaryotic genome (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) were completed. Between 40-60% of the genes were found to code for proteins to which no function could be assigned. We describe an approach which combines proteome analysis (mapping of expressed proteins isolated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to the genome) with genetic manipulations to study the complex pattern of protein regulation occurring in Escherichia coli in response to sulfate starvation. We have previously described the upregulation of eight spots on two-dimensional (2-D) gels in response to sulfate starvation and the assignment of six of these to entries in the E. coli genome sequence (Quadroni et al., Eur. J. Biochem. 1996, 239, 773-781). Here we describe the identification of the remaining two proteins which are encoded in a sulfate-controlled operon in the 21.5' region of the E. coli genome. Upregulated protein spots were cut from multiple 2-D gels collected and run on a modified funnel gel to concentrate the proteins and remove the sodium dodecyl sulfate before digestion. The peptide masses obtained from the digests were used to search the SwissProt database or a six-frame translation of the EMBL DNA database using a peptide mass fingerprinting algorithm. A digest can be reanalyzed after deuterium exchange to obtain a second, orthogonal data set to increase the confidence level of protein identification. The digests of the remaining unidentified proteins were used for peptide fragment generation using either post-source decay in a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight mass spectrometer or collision-induced dissociation (CID) coupled mass spectrometry (MS/MS) with triple stage quadrupole or ion trap mass spectrometers. The spectra were used as peptide fragment fingerprints to search the SwissProt and EMBL databases.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic properties of faropenem demonstrated by studies of time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  - The pharmacodynamic properties of faropenem, a new oral penem antibiotic, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect. Time-kill kinetics were employed against strains of Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pyogenes. The postantibiotic effects of faropenem were studied using strains of E. coli, S. aureus, H. influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The time-kill kinetic data demonstrated that faropenem has bactericidal activity. Faropenem exhibited a significant postantibiotic effect against all strains except H. influenzae.
TI  - Molecular genetic analysis of the region containing the essential Pseudomonas aeruginosa asd gene encoding aspartate-beta-semialdehyde dehydrogenase.
AB  - asd mutants of Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria have an obligate requirement for diaminopimelic acid (DAP), an essential constituent of the cell wall of these organisms. In environments deprived of DAP, for example mammalian tissues, they will undergo lysis. This was previously exploited to develop vaccine strains of Salmonella typhimurium and cloning vectors containing asd as an in vivo selectable marker. As a first step for development of such systems for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the asd gene from wild-type strain PAO1 was cloned by a combined approach of PCR amplification from chromosomal DNA, construction of mini-libraries and by complementation of an Escherichia coli delta asd mutant. The nucleotide sequence of a 2433 bp Smal-Nsil fragment was determined. This fragment contained the C-terminal 47 nucleotides of leuB, encoding 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase; asd, encoding aspartate-beta-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (Asd); and orfA, whose product showed similarity to the Asd proteins from Vibrio spp. By subcloning, asd was localized to a 1.24 kb DNA fragment which in an E. coli T7 expression system strongly expressed a 40,000 Da protein. The amino acid sequence was deduced from the DNA sequence. A comparison of the Asd proteins from P. aeruginosa, E. coli and Haemophilus influenzae revealed greater than 63% identity, demonstrating the conserved nature of Asd in Gram-negative bacteria, and defined the active-site-containing consensus sequence GGNCTVXMLMXXXLGLF as a possible signature motif. Chromosomal delta asd mutants were isolated. They were auxotrophic for DAP, lysine, methionine and threonine, and lysed in the absence of DAP. Genetic analyses indicated that orfA probably is naturally frame-shifted and does not contribute to the Asd phenotype. By PFGE, the asd gene was mapped to between coordinates 1.89 and 2.15 Mbp, or 37-40 min, on the 5.9 Mbp P. aeruginosa chromosome.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the haemocin immunity gene of Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The bacteriocin haemocin is produced by most type b strains of Haemophilus influenzae, including strains of diverse genetic lineage, and is toxic to virtually all nontypeable H. influenzae strains. An H. influenzae transformant bearing a plasmid with a 1.5-kbp chromosomal fragment capable of conferring haemocin immunity on a haemocin-susceptible H. influenzae mutant was selected by using partially purified haemocin. Deletional and site-directed mutagenesis localized the haemocin immunity gene to the 3' open reading frame (ORF) within this chromosomal fragment. Subcloning of this ORF demonstrated that it was sufficient to confer haemocin immunity on wild-type haemocin-susceptible H. influenzae strains as well as haemocin-susceptible strains of Escherichia coli. This ORF, designated hmcl, encodes a 105-amino-acid protein with an estimated molecular mass of 12.6 kDa. Primer extension analysis revealed a putative transcriptional start site 34 bp upstream of the start codon, and the presence of a promoter immediately upstream of hmcI was confirmed by cloning the gene into a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase vector. To characterize the hmcI gene product, a His-HmcI fusion protein was constructed.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the exbB-exbD-tonB locus of Pasteurella haemolytica A1.
AB  - A recombinant plasmid (pMG1) carrying Pasteurella haemolytica A1 DNA which complements a tonB mutation of Escherichia coli has been isolated. E. coli tonB metE which carries pMG1 exhibits growth kinetics in the presence of vitamin B12 similar to that of the wild-type host. In addition, the complemented E. coli is susceptible to killing by bacteriophage phi 80 and colicin B. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence in the complementing DNA showed that it codes for three genes in the order of exbB-exbD-tonB. This genetic organization has been reported in Haemophilus influenzae, H. ducreyi, Pseudomonas putida and Vibrio cholerae, and may represent a separate lineage of evolution from that of the Enterobacteriaceae in which tonB is unlinked with the accessory genes exbB and exbD. A comparison of the DNA flanking the exbB-exbD-tonB locus in P. haemolytica A1 and H. influenzae showed that the flanking regions are completely different between the two organisms.
TI  - Microbial genome sequencing opens door to new world.
AB  
TI  - Characterization of a novel transporter family that includes multiple Escherichia coli gluconate transporters and their homologues.
AB  - The nucleotide sequences of seven Escherichia coli genes that encode members of the gluconate permease (GntP) family have recently become available. These genes include gntP, gntU, gntW, ORf449, dsdX, and ORFo454. The deduced amino acid sequences of all seven E. coli genes are homologous to the gntP gene products from Bacillus subtilis and B. licheniformis as well as two additional gene products from Haemophilus influenzae. These 11 proteins are not demonstrably homologous to members of the major facilitator superfamily or other recognized permease families. Four of the E. coli gluconate transporter genes have been cloned and shown to encode gluconate transporters with apparent affinities ranging from 6 to 212 microM. These studies serve to characterize a novel family of bacterial permeases.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding the outer-membrane protein Tbp1 from  Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. Expression of Tbp1 and Tbp2.
AB  - Some Gram-negative bacteria possess a system for the uptake of iron from host's transferrin consisting of two outer-membrane proteins, namely transferrin-binding proteins 1 and 2. Here we present the cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding the transferrin-binding protein 1 from a serotype 1 isolate of the Gram-negative pathogen Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. We have also cloned for expression the Tbp1 and Tbp2 encoding sequences. Both proteins were produced in Escherichia coli and further purified. We also report the deduced Tbp1 amino acid sequence comparison to Tbp1s from related species.
TI  - Bacterial ghosts as multifunctional vaccine particles.
AB  - Expression of cloned PhiX174 gene E in Gram-negative bacteria results in lysis of the bacteria by formation of an E-specific transmembrane tunnel structure built through the cell envelope complex. Bacterial ghosts have been produced from a variety of bacteria including Escherichia coli. Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Vibrio cholerae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pasteurella haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Helicobacter pylori. Such ghosts are used as non-living candidate vaccines and represent an alternative to heat or chemically inactivated bacteria. In recombinant ghosts, foreign proteins can be inserted into the inner membrane prior to E-mediated lysis via specific N-, or C-, or N- and C-terminal anchor sequences. The export of proteins into the periplasmic space or the expression of recombinant S-layer proteins vastly extents the capacity of ghosts or recombinant ghosts as carriers of foreign epitopes or proteins. Oral, aerogenic or parenteral applications of (recombinant) ghosts in experimental animals induced specific humoral and cellular immune responses against bacterial and target components including protective mucosal immunity. The most relevant advantage of ghosts and recombinant bacterial ghosts as immunogens is that no inactivation procedures that denature relevant immunogenic determinants are employed in the production of ghosts used as vaccines or as carriers of relevant antigens. The inserted target antigens into the inner membrane or into S-layer proteins are not limited in size.
TI  - A national collaborative study of the in vitro activity of oral cephalosporins and loracarbef (LY 163892). Australian Group for the Study of Antimicrobial Resistance (AGAR).
AB  - A national collaborative study involving the laboratories of 17 Australian hospitals examined the in vitro activity of loracarbef, cefaclor, cephalexin, amoxycillin and amoxycillin/clavulanate against 2661 recently isolated common bacterial pathogens. Loracarbef was the most active agent against Escherichia coli (MIC90 = 1 mg/l) and had activity comparable to other agents against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Like the oral cephalosporins, it had no activity against species of Enterobacter and Serratia. beta-lactamase-producing Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae were moderately sensitive to loracarbef (MIC90 = 8 mg/l for both species). Streptococcus pneumoniae was moderately sensitive to loracarbef (MIC90 = 2 mg/l) but strains which were insensitive to penicillin were often highly resistant.
TI  - Neisseria meningitidis tonB, exbB, and exbD genes: Ton-dependent utilization of protein-bound iron in Neisseriae.
AB  - We have recently cloned and characterized the hemoglobin (Hb) receptor gene, hmbR, from Neisseria meningitidis. To identify additional proteins that are involved in Hb utilization, the N. meningitidis Hb utilization system was reconstituted in Escherichia coli. Five cosmids from N. meningitidis DNA library enabled a heme-requiring (hemA), HmbR-expressing mutant of E. coli to use Hb as both porphyrin and iron source. Nucleotide sequence analysis of DNA fragments subcloned from the Hb-complementing cosmids identified four open reading frames, three of them homologous to Pseudomonas putida, E. coli, and Haemophilus influenzae exbB, exbD, and tonB genes. The N. meningitidis TonB protein is 28.8 to 33.6% identical to other gram-negative TonB proteins, while the N. meningitidis ExbD protein shares between 23.3 and 34.3% identical amino acids with other ExbD and TolR proteins. The N. meningitidis ExbB protein was 24.7 to 36.1% homologous with other gram-negative ExbB and TolQ proteins. Complementation studies indicated that the neisserial Ton system cannot interact with the E. coli FhuA TonB-dependent outer membrane receptor. The N. meningitidis tonB mutant was unable to use Hb, Hb-haptoglobin complexes, transferrin, and lactoferrin as iron sources. Insertion of an antibiotic cassette in the 3' end of the exbD gene produced a leaky phenotype. Efficient usage of heme by N. meningitidis tonB and exbD mutants suggests the existence of a Ton-independent heme utilization mechanism. E. coli complementation studies and the analysis of N. meningitidis hmbR and hpu mutants suggested the existence of another Hb utilization mechanism in this organism.
TI  - A novel membrane-associated metalloprotease, Ste24p, is required for the first step of NH2-terminal processing of the yeast a-factor precursor.
AB  - Many secreted bioactive signaling molecules, including the yeast mating pheromones a-factor and alpha-factor, are initially synthesized as precursors requiring multiple intracellular processing enzymes to generate their mature forms. To identify new gene products involved in the biogenesis of a-factor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we carried out a screen for MA Ta-specific, mating-defective mutants. We have identified a new mutant, ste24, in addition to previously known sterile mutants. During its biogenesis in a wild-type strain, the a-factor precursor undergoes a series of COOH-terminal CAAX modifications, two sequential NH2-terminal cleavage events, and export from the cell. Identification of the a-factor biosynthetic intermediate that accumulates in the ste24 mutant revealed that STE24 is required for the first NH2-terminal proteolytic processing event within the a-factor precursor, which takes place after COOH-terminal CAAX modification is complete. The STE24 gene product contains multiple predicted membrane spans, a zinc metalloprotease motif (HEXXH), and a COOH-terminal ER retrieval signal (KKXX). The HEXXH protease motif is critical for STE24 activity, since STE24 fails to function when conserved residues within this motif are mutated. The identification of Ste24p homologues in a diverse group of organisms, including Escherichia coli, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Haemophilus influenzae, and Homo sapiens, indicates that Ste24p has been highly conserved throughout evolution. Ste24p and the proteins related to it define a new subfamily of proteins that are likely to function as intracellular, membrane-associated zinc metalloproteases.
TI  - Dissection of glutathionylspermidine synthetase/amidase from Escherichia coli into autonomously folding and functional synthetase and amidase domains.
AB  - The bifunctional glutathionylspermidine synthetase/amidase from Escherichia coli  catalyzes both the ATP-dependent formation of an amide bond between N1 of spermidine (N-(3-amino)propyl-1, 4-diaminobutane) and the glycine carboxylate of glutathione (gamma-Glu-Cys-Gly) and the opposing hydrolysis of this amide bond (Bollinger, J. M., Jr., Kwon, D. S., Huisman, G. W., Kolter, R., and Walsh, C. T. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 14031-14041). In our previous work describing its initial characterization, we proposed that the 619-amino acid (70 kDa) protein might possess separate amidase (N-terminal) and synthetase (C-terminal) domains. In the present study, we have confirmed this hypothesis by expression of independently folding and functional amidase and synthetase modules. A fragment containing the C-terminal 431 amino acids (50 kDa) has synthetase activity only, with steady-state kinetic parameters similar to the full-length protein. A fragment containing the N-terminal 225 amino acids (25 kDa) has amidase activity only and is significantly activated relative to the full-length protein for hydrolysis of glutathionylspermidine analogs. This observation suggests that the amidase activity in the full-length protein is negatively autoregulated. The amidase active site catalyzes hydrolysis of amide and ester derivatives of glutathione (e.g. glutathione ethyl ester and glutathione amide) but lacks activity toward acetylspermidine (N1 and N8) and acetylspermine (N1), indicating that glutathione provides the primary recognition determinants for glutathionylspermidine amide bond cleavage. No metal ion is required for the amidase activity. A tetrahedral phosphonate analogue of glutathionylspermidine, designed as a mimic of the proposed tetrahedral intermediate for either reaction, inhibits the synthetase activity (Ki approximately 10 microM) but does not inhibit the amidase activity.
TI  - Codon-anticodon assignment and detection of codon usage trends in seven microbial genomes.
AB  - We have assigned codon-anticodon recognition patterns for the whole set of transfer RNAs of Haemophilus influenzae Rd, Methanococcus jannaschii, and Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 using sequence information derived from the complete genome sequence of these organisms and have tabulated them along with those previously reported for Escherichia coli, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using the resulting codon-anticodon tables, the bias in codon usage of genes encoding the entire protein and ribosomal protein complement of each of the seven microbial genomes was analyzed. Then, the codon adaptation index (CAIrp) for each protein gene was calculated using the codon usage preference of the ribosomal protein genes of the corresponding organism. Of the seven genomes examined, six showed CAIrp scores that roughly coincided with the expected level of gene expression. The result demonstrates that CAIrp analysis may be useful for prediction of the expression level of unknown genes when all or at least considerable portions of the genome sequence are available.
TI  - The aroQ and pheA domains of the bifunctional P-protein from Xanthomonas campestris in a context of genomic comparison.
AB  - The gene (denoted aroQp.pheA) encoding the bifunctional P-protein (chorismate mutase-P/prephenate dehydratase) from Xanthomonas campestris was cloned. aroQp.pheA is essential for L-phenylalanine biosynthesis. DNA sequencing of the smallest subclone capable of functional complementation of an Escherichia coli phenylalanine auxotroph revealed a putative open reading frame (ORF) of 1200 bp that would encode a 43,438-Da protein. AroQp.PheA exhibited 51% amino acid identity with a Pseudomonas stutzeri homologoue and greater than 30% identities with AroQp.PheA proteins from Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and a number of enteric bacteria. AroQp.PheA from X. campestris, when expressed in E. coli, possesses a 40-residue amino-terminal extension that is lysine-rich and that is absent in all of the AroQp.PheA homologues known at present. About 95% of AroQp.PheA was particulate and readily sedimented by low-speed centrifugation. Soluble preparations of cloned AroQp.PheA exhibited a native molecular mass of 81,000 Da, indicating that the active enzyme species is a homodimer. These preparations were unstable after purification of about 40-fold, even in the presence of glycerol, which was an effective protectant before fractionation. When AroQp.PheA was overproduced by a T7 translation vector, unusual inclusion bodies having a macromolecular structure consisting of protein fibrils were observed by electron microscopy. Insoluble protein collected at low-speed centrifugation possessed high catalytic activity. The single band obtained via SDS-PAGE was used to confirm the translational start via N-terminal amino acid sequencing. A perspective on the evolutionary relationships of monofunctional AroQ and PheA proteins and the AroQp.PheA family of proteins is presented. A serC gene located immediately upstream of X. campestris aroQp.pheA appears to reflect a conserved gene organization, and both may belong to a single transcriptional unit.
TI  - A whole genome shotgun gene fusion method for isolation of translation initiation sites in Escherichia coli: identification of Haemophilus influenzae translation initiation sites in E. coli.
AB  - We have developed a new method for isolating translation initiation sites based on the expression of Haemophilus influenzae Rd gene fusions with the Escherichia coli galactokinase (galK) gene. We cloned random DNA fragments of H. influenzae Rd DNA into a plasmid vector containing the galK coding sequence from which the translation initiation site (the ribosome binding site and translation initiation codon) had been removed. A subset of the cloned DNA fragments contained translation initiation sites that, when fused to the galK gene, produced active galactokinase and complemented the host galK mutation. Molecules expressing galactokinase activity were isolated and characterized by DNA sequence analysis, and the sequences were aligned with the recently completed whole genomic sequence of H. influenzae Rd. Translation initiation sites for known, hypothetical, and new genes were identified. Translation initiation sites internal to the coding sequences of a number of genes were identified, suggesting that internal translation initiation sites are common, especially in large genes. This shotgun method provides functional information on translation initiation sites and helps to define gene coding sequences.
TI  - Characteristic distribution of bases and codons around the initiation and termination codons in whole reading frames in bacteria and yeast genomes.
AB  - Recently the complete nucleotide sequence of the entire genome was determined for yeast and a few kinds of bacterium. To see characteristic features of base sequence in the cistron (actually the open reading frame, ORF) and in the regions around a cistron (ORF), the biases of appearance frequency of bases from the base ratio were studied statistically. In the regions before the base biases were observed. The characteristic base distribution patterns were similar to all the cases of bacteria, but different from yeast. The base biases are reflected on the appearance frequency of amino acids near the N-termini and C-termini of proteins. The characteristic biases found in the amino acid sequence of the N-terminal part of bacteria proteins are different from that in yeast proteins.
TI  - [Etiologic factors for purulent meningitis in children. Twenty years of personal  observations].
AB  - Etiological agents in purulent meningitis cases hospitalized during two 9 years periods: 1977-1985 and 1988-1996 were compared. While the percentage of cases caused by Neisseria meningitidis was similar in the two analyzed periods (55.7% i 66.5%, respectively), the percentage of cases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae decreased from 33.5% to 8.4% and the percentages of cases caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b increased from 0.6% to 14.2%. The analysis of the sensitivity of isolated strains of H. influenzae type b shows the occurrence of strains resistant to ampicillin and chloramphenicol.
TI  - Genome plasticity as a paradigm of eubacteria evolution.
AB  - To test the hypotheses that eubacterial genomes leave evolutionarily stable structures and that the variety of genome size is brought about through genome doubling during evolution, the genome structures of Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus subtilis were compared using the DNA sequences of the entire genome or substantial portions of genome. In these comparisons, the locations of orthologous genes were examined among different genomes. Using orthologous genes for the comparisons guaranteed that differences revealed in physical location would reflect changes in genome structure after speciation. We found that dynamic rearrangements have so frequently occurred in eubacterial genomes as to break operon structures during evolution, even after the relatively recent divergence between E. coli and H. influenzae. Interestingly, in such eubacterial genomes of high plasticity, we could find several highly conservative regions with the longest conserved region comprising the S10, spc, and alpha operons. This suggests that such exceptional conservative regions have undergone strong structural constraints during evolution.
TI  - Structure of the Haemophilus influenzae uvr-1+ gene: homology with other uvrC-like genes and characterization of the Haemophilus influenzae uvr-1 and uvr-2 mutations.
AB  - A 3.9 kb Haemophilus influenzae genomic DNA fragment was cloned in plasmid pUC9 that partially complemented the ultraviolet light sensitivity (UVs) of Escherichia coli uvrC mutant hosts. This fragment also complemented the UVs of H. influenzae uvr-1 (DB112) and uvr-2 (DB116) mutants. It genetically transformed the latter mutants to wild type UV resistance. The nucleotide (nt) sequence of this fragment revealed 3 open reading frames (ORFs). ORF2, now designated uvr-1+ (1746 nt), shows significant similarity in both the nt and amino acid (aa) composition to 7 complete proven or putative uvrC gene sequences. Computer analysis of the DNA sequence revealed several possible regulatory motifs 5' to uvr-1+, including a putative LexA-binding site as an inverted SOS box, located within the 3' region of ORF1, (extensive homology to the E. coli CMP-KDO synthetase gene), upstream of uvr-1+. Further computer analysis has also predicted that the four putative active site amino acids, located in the C-terminal half of each protein, are each situated in an area of secondary structure that are highly conserved.
TI  - Regulation of bacterial responses to oxidative stress.
AB  
TI  - A Bacillus cereus member of the SNF2 family.
AB  - The complete sequence of a Bacillus cereus member of the SNF2 family of putative  helicases showed conservation of all seven motifs typical of this family. Bcsnf predicted a protein of 1064 aa where the conserved SNF2 domain was located at the carboxy terminus, whereas the 633 amino-terminal aa showed no homology to any protein in the databases. A putative transcriptional start was identified by primer extension, indicating that Bcsnf is not a part of a larger operon. No phenotypical changes were observed after insertional inactivation of Bcsnf. The completely sequenced genomes of Mycoplasma genitalium and Haemophilus influenzae contain one ORF each with similarity to the SNF2 family: MG018 and HI0616, respectively. A phylogenetic tree of the SNF2 family showed that BcSNF and MG018 were most closely related, and appeared closer to the eukaryotic members of the SNF2 family than to the two other bacterial members of the family, HepA from Escherichia coli and HI0616.
TI  - Conserved clusters of functionally related genes in two bacterial genomes.
AB  - An approach for genome comparison, combining function classification of gene products and sequence comparison, is presented. The genomes of Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli are analyzed, and all genes are classified into nine major functional classes, corresponding to important cellular processes. To study gene order relationships and genome organization in the two bacteria, we performed statistics on neighboring pairs of genes. To estimate the significance of the observations, a statistical model based on binomial distributions has been developed. Significant patterns of gene order are observed within, as well as between, the two bacterial genomes: Functionally related genes tend to be neighbors more often than do unrelated genes. Some of these groups represent well-known operons, but additional gene clusters are identified. These clusters correspond to genomic elements that have been conserved during bacterial evolution. In addition to nearest-neighbor relationships, the method is also useful to study the relative direction of transcription in genomes, which is also highly conserved between homologous gene pairs. This new approach combines the high-level description of molecular function with pair statistics that express genome organization. It is expected to complement traditional methods of sequence analysis in the study of genomic structure, function, and evolution.
TI  - Neonatal airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli: association with severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Airway colonization with Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) and Gram-positive cocci (GPC) is common in mechanically ventilated neonates. Whether GNB are related to nosocomial bloodstream infection (BSI) and/or to the severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is unknown. METHODS: We prospectively examine this relationship using a cohort design. Data from 260 < or = 1250-g birth weight inborn infants (1991 to 1995) intubated > or = 2 weeks included 917 serial tracheal cultures and 583 blood cultures. The severity of BPD was assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and the use of home oxygen supplementation. RESULTS: After 2 weeks of ventilation, 80% of the infants were colonized with GPC (Staphylococus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus in 90% of the cases). Superimposed on 36% of these infants was GNB airway colonization with Klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), Enterobacter cloacae (25%), Escherichia coli (25%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), Serratia marcescen (10%), Acinetobacter baumannii and Haemophilus influenzae (5%). Comparison between 174 GPC- and 86 GNB-colonized infants showed that demographics, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal risk factors and mortality were similar. Fifteen percent of GNB-colonized infants developed BSI caused by GNB and 14% developed BSI caused by GPC. No significant temporal relationship between airway colonization and BSI was noted. GNB infants were ventilated longer and required oxygen at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and home oxygen supplementation twice as often as infants colonized only with GPC. GNB colonization was a predictor of severe BPD after controlling for ventilation. Ureaplasma colonization occurred in 28% of GNB-colonized and 33% of noncolonized infants and was not a predictor of BPD severity. CONCLUSION: GNB airway colonization creates a moderate risk for BSI. Antibiotic treatment does not regularly eradicate GNB. GNB airway colonization is associated with severe BPD, but further studies will be necessary before therapeutic efforts to eradicate GNB from the airways should be undertaken.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime in vitro.
AB  - Cefpodoxime proxetil is a new orally administered prodrug which is absorbed and de-esterified by the intestinal mucosa to release the third-generation cephalosporin, cefpodoxime, and which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. Using the standard agar dilution method, we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other oral cephalosporins and quinolones against 637 recent clinical isolates from Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital in Taiwan. Against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, cefpodoxime showed excellent activity, inhibiting over 90% of these isolates at 1 mg/l. Like other oral drugs of its class, it had little activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. Against Haemophilus influenzae, irrespective of beta-lactamase production, its activity was similar to comparative drugs. Against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, cefpodoxime showed moderate activity, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 4 mg/l, whereas it was inactive against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. However, all cephalosporins have shown little in vivo activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus regardless of in vitro results. Cefpodoxime was inactive against Enterococcus spp. Against other streptococci, its activity was similar to other oral cephalosporins and quinolones tested. The results of this in vitro study indicated that oral administration of cefpodoxime should be an ideal agent in the empirical outpatient treatment for community-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.
TI  - Identification of a novel selD homolog from eukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea: is there an autoregulatory mechanism in selenocysteine metabolism?
AB  - Escherichia coli selenophosphate synthetase (SPS, the selD gene product) catalyzes the production of monoselenophosphate, the selenium donor compound required for synthesis of selenocysteine (Sec) and seleno-tRNAs. We report the molecular cloning of human and mouse homologs of the selD gene, designated Sps2, which contains an in-frame TGA codon at a site corresponding to the enzyme's putative active site. These sequences allow the identification of selD gene homologs in the genomes of the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae and the archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii, which had been previously misinterpreted due to their in-frame TGA codon. Sps2 mRNA levels are elevated in organs previously implicated in the synthesis of selenoproteins and in active sites of blood cell development. In addition, we show that Sps2 mRNA is up-regulated upon activation of T lymphocytes and have mapped the Sps2 gene to mouse chromosome 7. Using the mouse gene isolated from the hematopoietic cell line FDCPmixA4, we devised a construct for protein expression that results in the insertion of a FLAG tag sequence at the N terminus of the SPS2 protein. This strategy allowed us to document the readthrough of the in-frame TGA codon and the incorporation of 75Se into SPS2. These results suggest the existence of an autoregulatory mechanism involving the incorporation of Sec into SPS2 that might be relevant to blood cell biology. This mechanism is likely to have been present in ancient life forms and conserved in a variety of living organisms from all domains of life.
TI  - The identification a novel gene required for lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis by Haemophilus influenzae RM7004, using transposon Tn916 mutagenesis.
AB  - Mutagenesis with the transposon Tn916 was used as a strategy to identify genes required for synthesis of the Gal alpha (1-4) beta Gal component of Haemophilus influenzae strain RM7004 lipopolysaccharide. Insertion of Tn916 into an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a protein with 75% homology to the Escherichia coli methionine related protein (Mrp) is described. Mutations in mrp resulted in loss of reactivity with monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4C4, which recognises Gal alpha (1-4) beta Gal, and expression of LPS with a different electrophoretic profile to that of wild-type RM7004. An unexpected feature of this mutation was that it appeared to influence the number of copies of 5'-CAAT-3' present in lic2A, a gene which is also required for biosynthesis and phase variable expression of the Gal alpha (1-4) beta Gal LPS epitope.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding the Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase of Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - The sodC gene of Haemophilus ducreyi was cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino  acid sequence of this protein exhibited 71.6% identity and 81.8% similarity to the H. influenzae and H. parainfluenzae copper (Cu), zinc (Zn)-superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes. This gene was localized to a 2.2-kb H. ducreyi chromosomal DNA insert in plasmid pHdSOD. SOD activity was expressed in cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli containing the recombinant plasmid pHdSOD and was localized to the periplasmic space. The Cu,Zn-SOD produced by the H. ducreyi sodC gene did not complement the aerobic growth defect of an E. coli SOD-deficient mutant.
TI  - Aerobic bacteria isolated from blood cultures of patients and their antibiotic susceptibilities in Harare, Zimbabwe.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the extent of involvement of different types of gram positive and gram negative bacteria and incidence of monomicrobial and polymicrobial cases in patients with bacteremia but without a record of the underlying clinical conditions of the patients. Antibiotic susceptibility patterns of isolates were also determined to guide clinicians in the management of such bacteremic cases especially where routine sensitivity testing is not performed. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: The study comprised patients attending different clinics in Parirenyatwa Hospital, Harare. SUBJECTS: A total of 817 blood cultures from patients, comprising 469 and 348 males and females respectively. There were no records of the underlying clinical conditions of the patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence rates of organisms and their antibiograms using standard techniques and Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Results obtained revealed that only 303(37.1%) of the 817 total samples screened were positive for either monomicrobial or polymicrobial bacteremia. Two hundred and eighteen (71.9%) and 85 of positive cultures were Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria respectively. Coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) strains were the predominant organisms isolated (42.9%). Other organisms isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (11.6%), Escherichia coli (6.9%), Salmonella spp. (8.3%), Klebsiella spp. (5.3%), whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter and Micrococcus species each accounted for less than 4%. Antibiogram patterns showed multiple resistance of S. aureus and CNS to Penicillin, Erythromycin and Methicillin. All isolates of S. pyogenes (10), S. pneumoniae (18) and Micrococcus spp (10). were susceptible to penicillin. Ciprofloxacin, Clindamycin, Fusidic acid and Gentamycin were highly active against gram positive organisms except that Gentamycin was inactive against S. pneumoniae. Ceforoxime, Erythromycin and Ceftriazone also showed good activities against Gram positive organisms. All (10) isolates of P. aeruginosa were susceptible to Polymyxin B, Carbenicillin and Ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin, Norfloxacin and Gentamycin were highly active against all Gram negative bacteria. CONCLUSION: For infections due to both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, Ciprofloxacin and Gentamycin would be appropriate for therapy whereas Fusidic acid and Clindamycin may, in addition, be recommended for Gram positive organisms. It is also concluded that a prevalence rate of 37.1% of bacteremic cases existed in the sampled population and that monomicrobial cases were more predominant.
TI  - Postantibiotic and post-beta-lactamase inhibitor effects of amoxicillin plus clavulanate.
AB  - The postantibiotic effect (PAE) of amoxicillin-clavulanate was studied for strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. A PAE of approximately 2 h was seen for beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains of S. aureus following 2 h of exposure to twice the MIC and did not increase at 16 times the MIC. The PAE observed with H. influenzae was clearly related to the growth rate of the organism. A PAE of 0.8 h was found for amoxicillin (four times the MIC) against a beta-lactamase-negative strain of H. influenzae (generation time, 26.3 min) and a PAE of 1.74 h was found for amoxicillin-clavulanate (twice the MIC) against a beta-lactamase-positive strain (generation time, 32.2 min). When the beta-lactamase-positive strain was growing more slowly (generation time, 120 min), the PAE of amoxicillin-clavulanate increased to > 3.32 h. The PAE of amoxicillin-clavulanate at 2/1 micrograms/ml on a beta-lactamase-producing strain of M. catarrhalis was > 2.9 h, and, as expected, the PAEs of twice the MIC on K. pneumoniae and E. coli were generally short (< 1 h). The post-beta-lactamase inhibitor effect (PLIE), determined after removal of only clavulanate, was also examined for beta-lactamase-positive strains. This was more prolonged (approximately 3 to 4 h) than the corresponding PAE for S. aureus, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis. The PLIE was related to the amount of beta-lactamase produced and required the presence of amoxicillin in the initial exposure period. These data may have implications for reducing the dosage of amoxicillin-clavulanate.
TI  - Involvement of bacterial antigens in immunoglobulin A nephropathy.
AB  - To investigate the involvement of bacterial antigens in Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy, we measured IgA, IgG and IgM antibodies to gram-negative Escherichia coli (E.coli) and Haemophilus influenzae (H.influenzae) by ELISA in 24 patients (11 males and 13 females) with IgA nephropathy and 22 normal controls (11 males and 11 females). The titers of IgA and IgM antibodies for E.coli and H.influenzae were significantly higher in the IgA nephropathy group than in the controls. In addition, IgA and IgM antibody titers for E.coli and H.influenzae showed a significant positive correlation with serum IgA and IgM levels. These findings suggest that subclinical infection by these bacteria stimulates IgA production and that this may be a factor in the development and progression of IgA nephropathy.
TI  - [Current problems in the treatment of bacterial meningitis].
AB  - This paper on bacterial meningitis looks at aspects inherent in the aetiology and mechanisms underlying neurological damage and pharmacological treatment. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b and Neisseria meningitidis are the pathogens most commonly responsible and are able to colonise the host's respiratory mucosae, invade the vascular space, cross the haematoliquoral barrier and survive in the cerebrospinal fluid. The presence of germs in the subarachnoid spaces leads to the onset of inflammation and neurological damage. The most often used pharmacological treatments include, apart from antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs (although we have clinical data for corticosteroids only), pentoxyphillin and monoclonal antibodies. Initially empiric, antibiotic therapy is based on the use of drugs that act against the probable pathogenic agents, are capable of surmounting the haematoliquoral barrier and are well tolerated. Prior to the Eighties, the antibiotic of choice was ampicillin associated or otherwise with aminoglycosides. Subsequently, the availability of new drugs (cefotaxime and ceftriaxone) and the appearance of resistance led to changes in therapeutic protocols. Of the carbapenemics, wide spectrum antibiotics with high resistance to beta lactamase, imipenem /cilastatin proved effective although there was a high risk of inducing convulsions in patients with previous neurological damage or kidney failure. Meropenem was able to surmount the haematoliquoral barrier in sufficient concentrations and was well tolerated in patients with prior neurological changes. It has proved effective in clinical studies carried out up to the present.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of derivatives of the glycopeptide antibiotic A-40926 and its aglycone.
AB  - Starting from the antibiotic A-40926 and the aglycone of A-40926 a series of compounds were prepared by modifying the free functionalities. Their antimicrobial activity was determined, particularly against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, against which A-40926, unlike other natural glycopeptides, is active. Improved in vivo activity was displayed by the monomethyl ester of A-40926 esterified at the carboxyl group of the N-acylamino-glucuronyl moiety.
TI  - Correspondence discriminant analysis: a multivariate method for comparing classes of protein and nucleic acid sequences.
AB  - This report describes two applications of a multivariate method for studying classes of nucleotide or protein sequences: correspondence discriminant analysis (CDA). The first example is the discrimination between Escherichia coli proteins according to their subcellular location (membrane, cytoplasm and periplasm). The high resolution of the method made it possible to predict the subcellular location of E.coli proteins for whom this information is not known. The second example is discrimination between the coding sequences of leading and lagging strands in four bacteria: Mycoplasma genitalium, Haemophilus influenzae, E.coli and Bacillus subtilis. The programs used for computing the analysis are integrated in a publicly available package that runs on MacOS 7.x or Windows 95 operating systems (http:/(/)biomserv.univ-lyonl.fr/ADE-4.html). These programs are also accessible through our World Wide Web server (http:/(/)biomserv.univ-lyonl.fr/Net Mul.html).
TI  - Cloning and genetic characterization of Helicobacter pylori catalase and construction of a catalase-deficient mutant strain.
AB  - The N-terminal sequence of a protein, originally described as an adhesin of Helicobacter pylori, was used in an oligonucleotide-based screening procedure of an H. pylori plasmid library in Escherichia coli. Five independent plasmid clones were isolated, all mapping to the same chromosomal region and encoding the H. pylori catalase. The gene, designated katA, comprises 1,518 nucleotides and encodes a putative protein of 505 amino acids with a predicted Mr of 58,599. A second open reading frame, orf2, encoding a putative 32,715-Da protein of unknown function, follows katA. The transcriptional start site of katA mRNA was determined, but no typical consensus promoter sequence was present. A potential binding site for the Fur protein is located upstream of katA. When introduced into the catalase-deficient E. coli double-mutant UM255, the cloned gene readily complemented E. coli for catalase activity. H. pylori KatA is highly homologous to catalases in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, with the highest homology being shown to Bordetella pertussis (64.9%), Bacteroides fragilis (59.8%), and Haemophilus influenzae (57.9%) catalases. Transposon insertion mutants were generated in three independent H. pylori strains by TnMax5-mediated transposon shuttle mutagenesis. In contrast to the wild-type strains, no significant catalase-specific enzymatic activity could be detected in the mutant strains, consistent with the fact that no additional katA-homologous gene copies were found in the H. pylori chromosome. No significant difference between wild-type and mutant strains for binding to epithelial cells was apparent, suggesting that KatA is not involved in H. pylori adhesion. The cloning and genetic characterization of katA are essential steps for further investigation of the role of catalase in the defense of H. pylori against oxygen-dependent killing mechanisms by polymorphonuclear granulocytes, a process not well understood for this chronically persisting pathogen.
TI  - Sequence and transcriptional analysis of clpX, a class-III heat-shock gene of Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of clpX, which is localized between the tig (trigger factor) and the lon (ATP-dependent protease) genes at 245 degrees on the standard Bacillus subtilis (Bs) genetic map, was determined. The putative clpX gene codes for a 46-kDa protein of 421 amino acid (aa) residues. A comparison of the deduced aa sequence with those of the recently described bacterial clpX gene products from Synechocystis sp., Escherichia coli (Ec), Haemophilus influenzae and Azotobacter vinelandii revealed strong similarities. However, in contrast to Ec, clpX and clpP of Bs are located at different loci on the chromosome and are transcribed as monocistronic genes. A heat-inducible sigma A-like promoter was mapped upstream of the clpX structural gene, but no CIRCE element, characteristic of class-I heat-shock genes (e.g., groESL and dnaK), was found between the transcriptional and translational start sites. Although the majority of the heat-inducible general stress genes in Bs are under the control of the alternative sigma factor, sigma B, the heat induction of clpX appears to be sigma B-independent. The latter indicates that clpX belongs to class-III heat-inducible genes.
TI  - Monoclonal antibodies against conserved epitopes of a 46-kDa protein from Neisseria meningitidis.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to generate monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against conserved epitopes of B meningococcus which could be applicable to the immunoscreening of bacterial meningitis. Three mAbs reactive to a 46-kDa protein conserved in eight sero-groups and several sero(sub)types of Neisseria meningitidis were selected for the present study. No reaction was detected with whole-cell lysates of Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b or Escherichia coli. Two of these mAbs recognized 46-kDa epitopes in four other Neisseria spp, and the third, MC3.13, cross-reacted only with N. lactamica. All mAbs reacted with whole-cell lysates from a N. meningitidis mutant strain lacking the class 1 outer membrane protein (43-47 kDa). Immunoelectron microscopy revealed a cytoplasmic location for the 46-kDa protein. The MC3.13 monoclonal antibody is potentially applicable to a rapid screening of bacterial meningitis.
TI  - The 25 degrees-36 degrees region of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome: determination of the sequence of a 146 kb segment and identification of 113 genes.
AB  - We determined a 146 kb contiguous sequence at the 25 degrees-36 degrees region of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome containing the amyE-srfA segment. Among the 113 ORFs identified, 33 are already known. functions were assigned to 38 ORFs by a search of non-redundant protein sequence data banks and those of 16 ORFs were suggested through significant similarity with reported sequences. The amino acid sequences of 13 of the ORfs were similar to proteins of unknown function of Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae and other species. We did not find similarities for 29 ORFs to any known proteins. The 146 kb region is rich in enzymes (35 ORFs) related to the metabolism of low molecular mass compounds and five genes for surfactin production occupy about 26 kb of the region.
TI  - Effect of phagocytosis of bacteria on the uptake of sparfloxacin by human neutrophils.
AB  - The effect of phagocytosis of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae on the intracellular penetration of sparfloxacin into human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) was evaluated. The intracellular concentration of sparfloxacin was similar in PMN containing intracellular bacteria and in resting PMN [cellular to extracellular ratio (C/ E) > 8.0]. The uptake of sparfloxacin by human PMN significantly decreased during phagocytosis of opsonized H. influenzae but still reached intracellular concentrations five times greater than the extracellular ones. This effect was not observed with E. coli and S. aureus.
TI  - An example of non-conservation of oligomeric structure in prokaryotic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Biochemical and structural properties of glycyl-tRNA synthetase from Thermus thermophilus.
AB  - Glycyl-tRNA synthetase (Gly-tRNA synthetase) from Thermus thermophilus was purified to homogeneity and with high yield using a five-step purification procedure in amounts sufficient to solve its crystallographic structure [Logan, D.T., Mazauric, M.-H., Kern, D. & Moras, D. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 4156-4167]. Molecular-mass determinations of the native and denatured protein indicate an oligomeric structure of the alpha 2 type consistent with that found for eukaryotic Gly-tRNA synthetases (yeast and Bombyx mori), but different from that of Gly-tRNA synthetases from mesophilic prokaryotes (Escherichia coli and Bacillus brevis) which are alpha 2 beta 2 tetramers. N-terminal sequencing of the polypeptide chain reveals significant identity, reaching 50% with those of the eukaryotic enzymes (B. mori, Homo sapiens, yeast and Caenorhabditis elegans) but no significant identity was found with both alpha and beta chains of the prokaryotic enzymes (E. coli, Haemophilus influenzae and Coxiella burnetii) albeit the enzyme is deprived of the N-terminal extension characterizing eukaryotic synthetases. Thus, the thermophilic Gly-tRNA synthetase combines strong structural homologies of eukaryotic Gly-tRNA synthetases with a feature of prokaryotic synthetases. Heat-stability measurements show that this synthetase keeps its ATP-PPi exchange and aminoacylation activities up to 70 degrees C. Glycyladenylate strongly protects the enzyme against thermal inactivation at higher temperatures. Unexpectedly, tRNA(Gly) does not induce protection. Cross-aminoacylations reveal that the thermophilic Gly-tRNA synthetase charges heterologous E. coli tRNA(gly(GCC)) and tRNA(Gly(GCC)) and yeast tRNA(Gly(GCC)) as efficiently as T. thermophilus tRNA(Gly). All these aminoacylation reactions are characterized by similar activation energies as deduced from Arrhenius plots. Therefore, contrary to the E. coli and H. sapiens Gly-tRNA synthetases, the prokaryotic thermophilic enzyme does not possess a strict species specificity. The results are discussed in the context of the three-dimensional structure of the synthetase and in the view of the particular evolution of the glycinylation systems.
TI  - PhhR, a divergently transcribed activator of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene cluster of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa was recently found to possess a cluster of structural genes encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase (PhhA), carbinolamine dehydratase (PhhB), and aromatic aminotransferase (PhhC). We now report the presence, in the flanking upstream region, of a divergently transcribed gene (phhR) encoding an activator protein. Inactivation of phhR markedly reduced expression of the structural genes. PhhR belongs to the large prokaryote family of sigma 54 enhancer-binding proteins, and activation of the phh operon by PhhR in P. aeruginosa required rpoN. The closest homologues of PhhR are the TyrR proteins from Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae. E. coli TyrR is an unusual member of the homologue family in that the transcriptional units regulated by tyrR are driven by sigma 70 promoters. P. aeruginosa phhR was able to replace E. coli tyrR as a repressor of the aroF-tyrA operon (but not as an activator of mtr) in the heterologous E. coli system. Two regions that resemble E. coli TyrR boxes were identified in the intervening region between phhR and phhA. We propose that one or both boxes may be the target of PhhR acting as an autogenous repressor at a sigma 70 promoter in one direction. In the other direction, one or both boxes may be the upstream activator sequence targeted by PhhR to facilitate expression of the phh operon from a sigma 54 promoter. The phh operon was strongly induced in fructose- or glucose-based minimal medium by L-phenylalanine. Inactivation of phhR in P. aeruginosa abolished ability to utilize either L-phenylalanine or L-tyrosine as a sole source of carbon for growth.
TI  - A third family of allelic hsd genes in Salmonella enterica: sequence comparisons  with related proteins identify conserved regions implicated in restriction of DNA.
AB  - Salmonella enterica serovar blegdam has a restriction and modification system encoded by genes linked to serB. We have cloned these genes, putative alleles of the hsd locus of Escherichia coli K-12, and confirmed by the sequence similarities of flanking DNA that the hsd genes of S. enterica serovar blegdam have the same chromosomal location as those of E. coli K-12 and Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium LT2. There is, however, no obvious similarity in their nucleotide sequences, and while the gene order in S. enterica serovar blegdam is serB hsdM, S and R, that in E. coli K-12 and S. enterica serovar typhimurium LT2 is serB hsdR, M and S. The hsd genes of S. enterica serovar blegdam identify a third family of serB-linked hsd genes (type ID). The polypeptide sequence predicted from the three hsd genes show some similarities (18-50% identity) with the polypeptides of known and putative type I restriction and modification systems; the highest levels of identity are with sequences of Haemophilus influenzae Rd. The HsdM polypeptide has the motifs characteristic of adenine methyltransferases. Comparisons of the HsdR sequence with those for three other families of type I systems and three putative HsdR polypeptides identify two highly conserved regions in addition to the seven proposed DEAD-box motifs.
TI  - Frequent oligonucleotides and peptides of the Haemophilus influenzae genome.
AB  - The complete Haemophilus influenzae genome (1.83 Mb, Rd strain) provides opportunities for characterizing global genomic inhomogeneities and for detecting important sequence signals. Along these lines, new methods for identifying frequent words (oligonucleotides and/or peptides) and their distributions are applied to the H.influenzae genome with some comparisons and contrasts made with frequent words of other bacterial genomes. Three major classes of frequent oligonucleotides stand out: (i) oligos related to the familiar uptake signal sequences (USSs), AAGTGCGGT (USS+) and its inverted complement (USS-), (ii) multiple tetranucleotide iterations and (iii) intergenic dyad sequences (ISDs) found as AAGCCCACCCTAC and its dyad form. The USS+ and USS- occur in almost equal counts, are remarkably evenly spaced around the genome, and appear predominantly in the same reading frame of protein coding domains (USS+ translated to Ser-Ala-Val, USS- translated to Thr-Ala-Leu). These observations suggest that USSs contribute to global genomic functions, for example, in replication and/or repair processes, or as membrane attachment sites, or as sequences helping to pack DNA. The long tetranucleotide iterations, virtually unique to H.influenzae (i.e., unknown in other prokaryotes), through polymerase slippage during replication and/or homologous recombination may produce subpopulations expressing alternative proteins. The 13 bp frequent IDS words, invariably intergenic, occur mostly in clusters and provide potential for complex secondary structures suggesting that these sequences may be important signals for regulating the activity of their flanking genes. The frequent oligopeptides of H.influenzae are principally of two kinds--those induced by oligonucleotide frequent words (USSs, tetranucleotide iterations), and those associated with ATP or GTP binding sites that are generally composed of three motifs: the A-box which contributes to delineating the binding pocket; the B-box which functions in hydrolysis; and the C-box whose function is unknown. The A-box occurs fairly universally in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The B- and C-motifs appear to be specialized to various functional groups (e.g., transport, recombination, chaperone activity). Other putative motifs correspond to homologs of Escherichia coli motifs, for example, are associated with proteins of transcriptional processing, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and proteins functioning in electron transfer.
TI  - Statistical evidence for a biochemical pathway of natural, sequence-targeted G/C  to C/G transversion mutagenesis in Haemophilus influenzae Rd.
AB  - Markov chain analysis of the Haemophilus influenzae Rd genome reveals striking under-representation of three palindromic tetranucleotide strings (CCGG, GGCC and CATG), accompanied by over-representation of six tetranucleotide strings that are derived from the former by exchanging strand location of the two residues making up a G/C nucleotide pair at the terminal palindrome position. Constraints are outlined for a molecular model able to explain the phenomenon as the result of sequence-targeted, enzyme-driven G/C to C/G transversion mutagenesis. Possible participation in the process by components of known DNA mismatch repair or restriction/modification systems (in particular, cytosine methylation) is discussed. The effect widens the spectrum of enzyme-driven, specific mutagenesis beyond the formerly described C/G to T/A transition (VSP repair of Escherichia coli). Potential evolutionary benefits of enzymatic pathways of specific mutagenesis can be envisioned.
TI  - Characterization of EspC, a 110-kilodalton protein secreted by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli which is homologous to members of the immunoglobulin A protease-like family of secreted proteins.
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) secretes at least five proteins. Two of  these proteins, EspA and EspB (previously called EaeB), activate signal transduction pathways in host epithelial cells. While the role of the other three proteins (39, 40, and 110 kDa) remains undetermined, secretion of all five proteins is under the control of perA, a known positive regulator of several EPEC virulence factors. On the basis of amino-terminal protein sequence data, we cloned and sequenced the gene which encodes the 110-kDa secreted protein and examined its possible role in EPEC signaling and interaction with epithelial cells. In accordance with the terminology used for espA and espB, we called this gene espC, for EPEC-secreted protein C. We found significant homology between the predicted EspC protein sequence and a family of immunoglobulin A (IgA) protease-like proteins which are widespread among pathogenic bacteria. Members of this protein family are found in avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (Tsh), Haemophilus influenzae (Hap), and Shigella flexneri (SepA). Although these proteins and EspC do not encode IgA protease activity, they have considerable homology with IgA protease from Neisseria gonorrhoeae and H. influenzae and appear to use a export system for secretion. We found that genes homologous to espC also exist in other pathogenic bacteria which cause attaching and effacing lesions, including Hafnia alvei biotype 19982, Citrobacter freundii biotype 4280, and rabbit diarrheagenic E. coli (RDEC-1). Although these strains secrete various proteins similar in molecular size to the proteins secreted by EPEC, we did not detect secretion of a 110-kDa protein by these strains. To examine the possible role of EspC in EPEC interactions with epithelial cells, we constructed a deletion mutant in espC by allelic exchange and characterized the mutant by standard tissue culture assays. We found that EspC is not necessary for mediating EPEC-induced signal transduction in HeLa epithelial cells and does not play a role in adherence or invasion of tissue culture cells.
TI  - Inhibition of growth of fungi pathogenic to man by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.
AB  - Ten strains of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were tested by a cross-streaking method for in-vitro inhibition of 10 strains of fungi known to infect man; these were Candida krusei, C. keyfr, C. guillermondii, C. tropicalis, C. lusitaniae, C. parapsilosis, C. pseudotropicalis, C. albicans, C. glabrata and Aspergillus fumigatus. Significant inhibition of fungal growth was observed with all 10 strains of S. maltophilia, but not with Escherichia coli NCTC 10418, Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 6571 and Haemophilus influenzae NCTC 11931.
TI  - S-formylglutathione hydrolase of Paracoccus denitrificans is homologous to human  esterase D: a universal pathway for formaldehyde detoxification?
AB  - Downstream of flhA, the Paracoccus denitrificans gene encoding glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase, an open reading frame was identified and called fghA. The gene product of fghA showed appreciable similarity with human esterase D and with the deduced amino acid sequences of open reading frames found in Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mutating fghA strongly reduced S-formylglutathione hydrolase activity. The mutant was unable to grow on methanol and methylamine, indicating that the enzyme is essential for methylotrophic growth. S-Formylglutathione hydrolase appears to be part of a formaldehyde detoxification pathway that is universal in nature.
TI  - Cloning, nucleotide sequence, and expression of the gene coding for a ribosome releasing factor-homologous protein of Brucella melitensis.
AB  - The gene coding for a Brucella melitensis cytosoluble protein (CP24) that is immunogenic in infected sheep and a major component of brucellin INRA was cloned and sequenced. As in Brucella cells, CP24 was located in the cytoplasm of recombinant Escherichia coli. The amino acid sequence predicted from the cloned gene revealed 48 and 46% identity with the ribosome releasing factor, a protein factor required for release of the 70S ribosome from the mRNA, of E. coli and Haemophilus influenzae Rd, respectively. Sera from naturally infected sheep and sheep experimentally infected with B. melitensis H38 showed antibody reactivity against recombinant CP24.
TI  - Fine mapping of outer membrane protein P2 antigenic sites which vary during persistent infection by Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Antigenic drift of the major outer membrane protein (MOMP) P2 of nonencapsulated  Haemophilus influenzae as observed during persistent infections in patients with chronic bronchitis was mimicked in a rabbit model in which H. influenzae persisted in subcutaneous cages. The antigenic drift resulted from amino acid substitutions in potentially surface-exposed loops of MOMP P2. Since in a rabbit model the appearance of antigenic variants was associated with the presence of strain-specific bactericidal antibodies (L. Vogel, B. Duim, F. Geluk, P. Eijk, H. Jansen, J. Dankert, and L. van Alphen, Infect. Immun. 64:980-986, 1996), we determined the epitope specificities of these bactericidal antibodies. The eight loops of MOMP P2 of H. influenzae d1 were separately expressed as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase. Sera of rabbits persistently infected with H. influenzae reacted with the loop 5 and loop 6 fusion proteins in immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. For fine mapping of the epitopes with pepscan analysis, overlapping synthetic peptides consisting of 12 amino acids were made. Rabbit sera contained antibodies reacting with peptides derived from loop 5 and peptides containing amino acids of the side of loop 6. In addition, MOMP P2 variant-specific reactions with the amino acids located at the tip of loop 6 were detected. The rabbit sera showed variant-specific complement-dependent bactericidal activities, which were eliminated by affinity chromatography with fusion proteins of loop 6 but not of loop 5. We conclude that, during persistence of H. influenzae in rabbits, variant-specific bactericidal antibodies are elicited to the variable tip of MOMP P2 loop 6.
TI  - Lack of expression of the global regulator OxyR in Haemophilus influenzae has a profound effect on growth phenotype.
AB  - A pBR322-based library of chromosomal DNA from the nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae TN106 was screened for the expression of transferrin-binding activity in Escherichia coli. A recombinant clone expressing transferrin-binding activity contained a 3.7-kb fragment of nontypeable H. influenzae DNA. Nucleotide sequence analysis of this insert revealed the presence of two complete open reading frames encoding proteins of approximately 26 and 34 kDa. Mini-Tn10kan transposon mutagenesis at different sites within the open reading frame encoding the 34-kDa protein resulted in the abolition of transferrin-binding activity in the recombinant E. coli clone. The deduced amino acid sequence of the 34-kDa protein had 70% identity with the OxyR protein of E. coli; this latter macromolecule is a member of the LysR family of transcriptional activators. When a mutated H. influenzae oxyR gene was introduced into the chromosome of the wild-type H. influenzae strain by allelic exchange, the resulting oxyR mutant still exhibited wild-type levels of transferrin-binding activity but was unable to grow on media containing the heme precursor protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) in place of heme. This mutant also exhibited reduced growth around disks impregnated with heme sources. Supplementation of the PPIX-based growth media with catalase or sodium pyruvate resulted in normal growth of the H. influenzae oxyR mutant. Provision of the wild-type H. influenzae oxyR gene in trans also permitted the growth of this mutant on a PPIX-based medium. Exogenously supplied catalase restored the growth of this mutant with heme sources to nearly wild-type levels. These results indicate that expression of a wild-type OxyR protein by H. influenzae is essential to allow this organism to protect itself against oxidative stresses in vitro.
TI  - Biological activity of serum antibodies to a nonacylated form of lipoprotein D of Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Protein D, a surface-exposed 42-kDa membrane lipoprotein, is well conserved among both type b and nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae strains, and it is considered a vaccine against H. influenzae infections. Here, we report the large-scale purification of a nonacylated form of protein D (PDm) from the periplasmic space of Escherichia coli overexpressing PDm. Screening of human sera for levels of antibodies to PDm demonstrated that the immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody level is above background levels in infants less than 6 months of age. Following a drop to background values in the age group 6 months to 1 year, IgG antibody levels start to increase, together with IgA antibody levels, after 1 year of age. The first appearance of serum IgM antibodies is in 6-month- to 1-year-old infants whose IgG antibody levels have dropped to the postnatal background level. Affinity-purified antibodies from humans and from PDm-immunized rats detected epitopes of protein D which are normally exposed on the bacterial surface. Affinity-isolated human anti-PDm antibodies eluted in acidic buffer were not bactericidal against H. influenzae. Loss of bactericidal activity may occur in this buffer, as was demonstrated in pooled human sera with high bactericidal activity after incubation in the same buffer. Hyperimmunization of rats with PDm induced high levels of serum IgG and IgA antibodies against PDm and significant bactericidal activity against homologous and heterologous H. influenzae strains.
TI  - Transkingdom transfer of the phosphoglucose isomerase gene.
AB  - Previous analysis of the gene encoding phosphoglucose isomerase (Pgi) suggests that this gene may have been transferred between a eukaryote and a bacterium. However, excluding the alternative hypothesis of ancient gene duplication has proven difficult because of both insufficient sampling of taxa and an earlier misidentification of a bacterial Pgi sequence. This paper presents a phylogenetic analysis of published complete Pgi sequences together with analysis of new partial Pgi sequences from six species of bacteria. The data identify a group of bacterial Pgi sequences, including sequences from Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae, which are more closely related to eukaryotic Pgi sequences than to other bacterial sequences. The topology of gene trees constructed using several different methods are all consistent with the hypothesis of lateral gene transfer and not ancient gene duplication. Furthermore, an estimate of a molecular clock for Pgi dates the divergence of the E. coli and H. influenzae sequences from the animal sequences to between 470 and 650 million years ago, well after other estimates of the divergence between eukaryotes and bacteria. This study provides the most convincing evidence to date of the transkingdom transfer of a nuclear gene.
TI  - The restriction-modification system of Pasteurella haemolytica is a member of a new family of type I enzymes.
AB  - Genes encoding the type I restriction-modification (R-M) system of the bovine pathogen, Pasteurella haemolytica, have been identified immediately downstream of a locus that encodes a transcriptional activator of P. haemolytica leukotoxin expression. Type I enzymes are encoded by three genes called hsdM, hsdS and hsdR, and have fallen into three groups, called Ia, Ib and Ic. HsdS provides a sequence recognition function which in concert with HsdM forms an active methyltransferase (MTase). Inclusion of the HsdR subunit in the complex creates an active restriction endonuclease (ENase) capable of cleaving unmethylated target DNA. The P. haemolytica hsdMSR genes were mapped using transposon Tn10d-Cam insertions, and bacteriophage restriction and modification assays in Escherichia coli. We determined the nucleotide sequences of hsdM, hsdS and hsdR, and observed that the deduced amino acid (aa) sequences were very similar to predicted R-M subunits in the respiratory pathogen, Haemophilus influenzae. Phylogenetic comparisons of all known Hsd aa sequences placed the P. haemolytica and H. influenzae proteins into a new group which we labeled the Type Id R-M family. Expression of the P. haemolytica R-M genes in E. coli was inefficient and is likely to be a consequence of the unusual codon usage in P. haemolytica genes.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of the Haemophilus influenzae tolQ, tolR, tolA and tolB genes.
AB  - The tolQ, R, A and B genes have been isolated from the DNA of Haemophilus influenzae and sequenced. The deduced amino acid (aa) sequence of the H. influenzae TolQ, TolR, TolA and TolB show 67, 63, 41 and 62% identity with Escherichia coli TolQRAB proteins, respectively. These four proteins are involved in transport of colicins and phages across the cell envelope. The translational stop codon of TolB (the last gene in the cluster) is 23 bases upstream of the start codon of the P6 lipoprotein gene. Primer extension and Northern blot analysis revealed that the start of the P6 transcript is within the tolB gene. Nucleotide sequence (nt) analysis of the entire tolQRABP6 region shows a transcriptional terminator immediately downstream of the P6 gene. The tolQRABP6 gene cluster of H. influenzae may thus constitute an operon.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of the Haemophilus influenzae uvrA gene.
AB  - The uvrA gene Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) was cloned and sequenced. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed 81% identity and 90% similarity with the Escherichia coli UvrA protein. Consistent with a role of Hi uvrA in DNA repair, a Hi uvrA mutant exhibited increased sensitivity of UV irradiation. Furthermore, Hi uvrA was able to complement a mutation in the E. coli uvrA locus.
TI  - Cloning and expression of genes encoding lipid A biosynthesis from Haemophilus influenzae type b.
AB  - Genes similar to Escherichia coli lpx genes (encoding enzymes required for the biosynthesis of lipid A) have been cloned from Haemophilus influenzae type b using a hybridisation-based strategy. The derived amino acid sequences are highly homologous to their E. coli counterparts. The genes appear in the same order in both E. coli and H. influenzae, but the intergenic regions differ. H. influenzae lpxA and lpxB have been expressed in E. coli minicells and they encode proteins of the predicted sizes. Both H. influenzae lpxA and lpxB are able to complement temperature-sensitive mutants in the equivalent genes in E. coli. This provides evidence that the genetic manipulation of lpx genes to generate altered lipid A molecules may be possible.
TI  - Domain structure of the prokaryotic selenocysteine-specific elongation factor SelB.
AB  - Incorporation of the non-canonical amino acid selenocysteine into proteins requires the activity of the elongation factor SelB which substitutes for the function of EF-Tu in contrast to EF-Tu, SelB binds selenocystylated tRNASec and an mRNA secondary structure adjacent to the UGA selenocysteine codon. To gain information on the domain structure of this specialized translation factor, the selB genes from two bacteria unrelated to Escherichia coli (Clostridium thermoaceticum and Desulfomicrobium baculatum) were cloned and sequenced. The derived amino acid residue sequences were compared to those of SelB from E. coli and Haemophilus influenzae and to EF-Tu sequences. The alignment revealed that SelB contains all three domains characterized for EF-Tu. A fourth, C-terminally located domain shows only limited sequence conservation within the four SelB proteins. To elucidate the function of this C-terminal part a structure-function analysis of SelB from E. coli was performed. It showed that a C-terminal 17 kDa subdomain of the translation factor, when expressed separately, specifically binds the mRNA secondary structure. The recognition motif itself could be reduced to a 17 nucleotide minihelix without loss of binding affinity and specificity. A truncated SelB lacking the mRNA binding domain was still able to interact with selenocysteyl-tRNASec. Expression of the mRNA binding domain alone suppressed selenocysteine insertion in vivo by competing with SelB for its binding site at the mRNA. The results indicate that SelB can be considered as an EF-Tu homolog hooked to the mRNA via its C-terminal domain.
TI  - [Usefulness of body surface cultures in newborns with early infection risk. Study of 735 neonates].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Difficulty in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis has lead to the practice of superficial cultures. The usefulness of this practice has been criticized repeatedly. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Results of 3881 cultures performed on 735 newborns (age < or = 48 hr) with early infection risk were reviewed. The types of samples chosen were urine (UR), gastric aspirate (GA), pharyngeal (PS), external ear (ES), umbilical swab (US), meconium (MC) and blood. BBV for sepsis for the different samples is calculated, as well as which ones better reflect vertical transmission. RESULTS: At the time of the study, 342 newborns (46.5%) were already colonized. Bacteria most frequently isolated were: E. coli (92), PCN staphylococci (85), enterococci (83) and S. agalactiae (70). Twenty-nine newborns had bacteriemia, with S. agalactiae being the leading cause (16). ES correlated best with positive blood cultures (83.3%). UR culture sensitivity was significantly lower than that of all other samples. The Highest PPVs were for GA, PS and US. NPV was high and similar for all samples (98-99%). ES and US best reflected vertical transmission (p < 0.0001). MC provided the highest number of positive mixed cultures, most of them difficult to evaluate. CONCLUSIONS: Body surface sample advantages are: 1) The possibility of discarding a vertically transmitted infection. 2) Quicker positive results than those in blood whenever liquid blood culture media are employed. 3) The possible identification of the etiologic agent when the mother has been given antibiotics intrapartum. 4). Information about dangerous colonization without infection. In order not to lose this useful information, but to save cost and effort, we advise that the number of surface cultures be reduced, keeping only ES and PS?
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against clinical isolates].
AB  - In order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefodizime (CDZM), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CDZM and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates collected from nation-wide medical institutions and in our laboratory from September to December of 1992 and from September to December of 1995. The results are summarized as follows: 1. Bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to CDZM included Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter koseri, Proteus mirabilis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The range of MIC values of CDZM against Klebsiella pneumoniae was spread. Other strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., Peptostreptococcus spp. and Bacteroides fragilis group were resistant to cephems including CDZM. 2. The MIC90's of CDZM were 0.05 approximately 3.13 micrograms/ml against Streptococcus spp., H. influenzae, M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, Klebsiella spp., P. mirabilis, N. gonorrhoeae and Peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently found in daily treatment of infections. It appears that the effectiveness of CDZM was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. Among H. influenzae isolates included imipenem (IPM)-resistant and norfloxacin (NFLX)-resistant strains. The MIC-range of CDZM against strains collected in 1995 including IPM-resistant and NFLX-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and MIC90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. CDZM showed strong antimicrobial activities against H. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.
TI  - Local and systemic antibody levels against protein D of Haemophilus influenzae following immunization and infection in rats.
AB  - Outer membrane proteins of Haemophilus influenzae are considered as possible vaccine candidates against non-typable H. influenzae (NTHi), a major cause of respiratory infections. Here, we study local and systemic antibody responses to protein D, a well-conserved 42-kDa membrane protein, following local and systemic immunization, and experimental acute otitis media (AOM) with NTHi and H. influenzae type b (Hib) in rats. Animals that were challenged and rechallenged in the middle ear with Hib strain Minn A or NTHi strain 1161 developed IgG and IgA antibodies in serum but not in middle ear lavage (MEL) material or saliva. In contrast, following per oral immunization with NTHi strain 772 and Escherichia coli JM83 (pHIC348) (containing protein D gene) and, to a lesser degree after intranasal inoculation of NTHi strain 772, high saliva IgA antibodies to protein D developed, but there was no rise in antibodies to protein D in the MEL material or the sera of these animals. These results show that protein D can elicit different systemic and local antibody responses depending on the site of delivery and the form of administration. Furthermore, experimental AOM with NTHi and Hib induces systemic IgG and IgA antibodies to protein D but fails to induce a mucosal immune response.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacteria, compared with other antibacterial agents. DESIGN: Survey of susceptibility of clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacilli. SETTING: Academic hospitals of the University isolates of the Witwatersrand teaching complex. BACTERIAL STRAINS: 180 selected clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacilli. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) determined by agar dilution using techniques according to the recommendations of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. RESULTS: Ciprofloxacin, biapenerm, imipenem, cefepime and cefpirome were all highly active against most of the Enterobacteriaceae. All the ampicillin-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam, MIC90 values being 4/4 mg/l for Klebsiella and Proteus/Providencia spp., 8/4 mg/l for Citrobacter and Serratia spp., and 16/4 mg/l for Escherichia coli. All the agents, with the exception of ampicillin (MIC90 4 mg/l) and chloramphenicol (MIC90 4 mg/l), were highly active against the Haemophilus influenzae isolates tested. All Bacteroides fragilis strains were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam (MIC90 8/4 mg/l), as well as to co-amoxiclav (MIC90 4/2 mg/l), biapenem and imipenem (MIC90s 0.5 mg/l). The Pseudomonas spp. tested included strains resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, biapenem, gentamicin, tobramycin and ciprofloxacin. Cefepime was the most active agent against Pseudomonas isolates, with 90% of the strains being susceptible to this agent, while biapenem was the most active agent against the Acinetobacter isolates investigated. CONCLUSIONS: The in vitro spectrum of activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against the majority of isolates was comparable to those of the other new agents tested.
TI  - GlpQ: an antigen for serological discrimination between relapsing fever and Lyme  borreliosis.
AB  - Tick-borne relapsing fever is caused by numerous Borrelia species maintained in nature by Ornithodoros tick-mammal cycles. Serological confirmation is based on either an immunofluorescence assay or an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using whole cells or sonicated Borrelia hermsii as the antigen. However, antigenic variability of this bacterium's outer surface proteins and antigens shared with the Lyme disease spirochete (B. burgdorferi), may cause both false-negative and false-positive results when testing sera of patients suspected to have either relapsing fever or Lyme disease. To develop a specific serological test for relapsing fever, we created a genomic DNA library of B. hermsii, screened transformed Escherichia coli cells for immunoreactivity with high-titered (> or = 1:2,048) human anti-B. hermsii antiserum, and selected an immunoreactive clone (pSPR75) expressing a 39-kDa protein. DNA sequencing, subcloning, and serum adsorption experiments identified the immunoreactive protein as a homolog of GlpQ, a glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase identified previously in E. coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacillus subtilis. Serum samples from humans and mice infected with B. hermsii or other species of relapsing fever spirochetes contained antibodies recognizing GlpQ, whereas serum samples from Lyme disease and syphilis patients were nonreactive. Serologic tests based on this antigen will identify people exposed previously to relapsing fever spirochetes and help clarify the distribution of relapsing fever and Lyme disease in situations in which the occurrence of their causative agents is uncertain.
TI  - Identification of new RNA modifying enzymes by iterative genome search using known modifying enzymes as probes.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequences of the Haemophilus influenzae and Mycoplasma genitalium genomes and the partially sequenced Escherichia coli chromosome were analyzed to identify open reading frames (ORFs) likely to encode RNA modifying enzymes. The protein sequences of known RNA modifying enzymes from three families--m5U methyltransferases, psi synthases and 2'-O methyltransferases--were used as probes to search sequence databases for homologs. ORFs identified as homologous to the initial probes were retrieved and used as new probes against the databases in an iterative manner until no more homologous ORFs could be identified. Using this approach, we have identified two new m5U methyltransferases, seven new psi synthases and four new 2'-O methyltransferases in E. coli. Many of the ORFs found in E.coli have direct genetic counterparts (orthologs) in one or both of H.influenzae and M.genitalium. Since there is a near-complete knowledge of RNA modifications in E.coli, functional activities of the proteins encoded by the identified ORFs were proposed based on the level of conservation of the ORFs and the modified nucleotides.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of two Serratia marcescens genes involved in core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis.
AB  - Bacteriocin 28b from Serratia marcescens binds to Escherichia coli outer membrane proteins OmpA and OmpF and to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) core (J. Enfedaque, S. Ferrer, J. F. Guasch, J. Tomas, and M. Reque, Can. J. Microbiol. 42:19-26, 1996). A cosmid-based genomic library of S. marcescens was introduced into E. coli NM554, and clones were screened for bacteriocin 28b resistance phenotype. One clone conferring resistance to bacteriocin 28b and showing an altered LPS core mobility in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was found. Southern blot experiments using DNA fragments containing E. coli rfa genes as probes suggested that the recombinant cosmid contained S. marcescens genes involved in LPS core biosynthesis. Subcloning, isolation of subclones and Tn5tac1 insertion mutants, and sequencing allowed identification of two apparently cotranscribed genes. The deduced amino acid sequence from the upstream gene showed 80% amino acid identity to the KdtA protein from E. coli, suggesting that this gene codes for the 3-deoxy-manno-octulosonic acid transferase of S. marcescens. The downstream gene (kdtX) codes for a protein showing 20% amino acid identity to the Haemophilus influenzae kdtB gene product. The S. marcescens KdtX protein is unrelated to the KdtB protein of E. coli K-12. Expression of the kdtX gene from S. marcescens in E. coli confers resistance to bacteriocin 28b.
TI  - Mutation and Mutagenesis of thiol peroxidase of Escherichia coli and a new type of thiol peroxidase family.
AB  - A novel thioredoxin-linked thiol peroxidase (Px) from Escherichia coli has been reported previously (M. K. Cha, H. K. Kim, and I. H. Kim, J. Biol. Chem. 270:28635-28641, 1995). In an attempt to perform physiological and biochemical characterizations of the thiol Px, a thiol Px null (tpx) mutant and a functional-residue mutant of thiol Px were produced. The tpx mutant was viable in aerobic culture but grew more slowly than the wild-type cells. The difference in growth rate became more pronounced when oxidative-stress-inducing reagents, such as peroxides and paraquat, were added to the cultures. The viability of the individual tpx mutant under oxidative stress was much lower than that of wild-type cells. tpx mutants growing aerobically respond to paraquat with a sixfold greater induction of Mn-superoxide dismutase than that of the wild-type cells. The deduced amino acid sequence of the thiol Px was found to be from 42 to 72% identical to the sequences of proteins from Haemophilus influenzae (ToxR regulon), Vibrio cholerae (ToxR regulon), and three kinds of streptococci (coaggregation-mediating adhesins), suggesting that they all belong to a new thiol Px family. Alignment of the amino acid sequences of the thiol Px family members showed that one cysteine, which corresponds to Cys-94 in E. coli thiol Px, is perfectly conserved. The substitution of serine for this cysteine residue resulted in complete loss of Px activity. These results suggest that the members of the thiol Px family, including E. coli thiol Px, have a functional cysteine residue and function in vivo as peroxidases.
TI  - Identification of a locus involved in the utilization of iron by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae.
AB  - The cloned afu locus of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae restored the ability of an Escherichia coli K-12 mutant (aroB) to grow on iron-limited media. DNA sequence analysis of the fragment showed that there are three genes designated afuA, afuB and afuC (Actinobacillus ferric uptake) that encode products similar to the SfuABC proteins of Serratia marcescens, the HitABC proteins of Haemophilus influenzae, the FbpABC proteins of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and the YfuABC proteins of Yersinia enterocolitica. The three genes encode a periplasmic iron-binding protein (AfuA), a highly hydrophobic integral cytoplasmic membrane protein with two consensus permease motifs (AfuB) and one hydrophilic peripheral cytoplasmic membrane protein with Walker ATP-binding motifs (AfuC), respectively. This system has been shown to constitute a periplasmic binding protein-dependent iron transport system in these organisms. The afuABC operon is locating approximately 200 bp upstream of apxIC gene, but transcribed in opposite direction to the ApxI-toxin genes.
TI  - Genetic characterization of trimethoprim resistance in Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - We previously demonstrated that trimethoprim (Tmp) resistance in Haemophilus influenzae is mediated by chromosomally encoded dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) with a modified primary structure and distinct kinetic properties. To gain insight into the relationship of the DHFR structure and the level of Tmp resistance that it confers on the host bacterium, we cloned and characterized the folH genes of one Tmp-susceptible and two Tmp-resistant H. influenzae strains. Differences were observed between Tmp-susceptible and Tmp-resistant isolates both in the promoter region and in the coding sequences. The effect of differences between H. influenzae folH genes on Tmp susceptibility was investigated in Escherichia coli. Various folH gene hybrids were constructed, and their influence on Tmp susceptibility was determined. Resistance in E. coli mediated by folH from H. influenzae strain R1047 was associated with alterations in the promoter and the central part of folH. In contrast, the E. coli Tmp resistance phenotype associated with the folH gene of H. influenzae R1042 was characterized by alterations in one or more of three amino acid residues at the C-terminal part of the protein. These data indicate that Tmp resistance is not only related to alterations in the promoter region of the folH gene and the Tmp binding domains at the N-terminal and central part of DHFR. Alterations in the C-terminal part may also cause Tmp resistance, probably as a result of a change in secondary structure and the subsequent loss of Tmp binding affinity.

TI  - Expression of Haemophilus influenzae type b idiotype 1 on naturally acquired antibodies.
AB  - The Chinese population in Hong Kong has a low incidence of invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b(Hib) disease, as well as carriage of the microorganism. Likely stimuli for the natural antibodies to Hib, which might protect against Hib infection, are cross-reactive antigens of bacteria like Escherichia coli K 100. Our aim was to determine the isotype and idiotype distribution and cross-reactivity of natural antibodies against Hib capsular polysaccharide (CP) in healthy Hong Kong Chinese. Titration of 20 sera by ELISA showed IgG antibodies reacting with Hib CP in all individuals. The antibodies were mainly IgG2, and their avidity index ranged widely. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) combined with immunoblotting showed patterns of IgG2 antibody clones against the CP of Hib and E. coli K 100 which were similar in 10 cases. Absorption with Hib CP only eliminated some bands in two sera. Absorption with K 100 CP did not remove any anti-Hib CP bands. In three sera additional clones of antibodies reacting to K 100 CP only, disappeared after absorption with this CP. Spectrotypic analyses of IgG antibodies reacting with anti-Hib idiotype 1 (Id-1) revealed stronger IEF patterns with bands in differing locations compared with anti-Hib CP antibodies. The strong reactivity of serum IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies with monoclonal anti-Hib Id-1 was confirmed by ELISA. This reactivity was not abolished after absorption of the sera with either Hib CP, or K 100 CP. The data indicate a high prevalence of Id-1 among Hong Kong Chinese. However, only one individual had Id-1 antibodies specific for Hib CP, judging from absorption experiments. Others had much lower activity of Id-1 anti-Hib CP antibodies compared with the total IgG Id-1, suggesting that Hong Kong subjects have Id-1-positive antibodies in their serum which are not specific for Hib CP. This is consistent with the nature of Id-1, which is a marker of A2VL region usage rather than a marker of a Hib CP paratope. We suggest that natural antibodies reacting with Hib CP in healthy Hong Kong Chinese are the product of exposure to some cross-reactive antigen(s), different from both Hib and E. coli K 100 CP.
TI  - Isolation, characterization, and expression of the Corynebacterium glutamicum betP gene, encoding the transport system for the compatible solute glycine betaine.
AB  - Corynebacterium glutamicum accumulates glycine betaine under conditions of high osmolarity. Previous work revealed the existence of a high-affinity glycine betaine permease which is osmotically regulated. In the present study, the corresponding gene was cloned. The betP gene, encoding the glycine betaine uptake carrier, was isolated by heterologous complementation of mutant strain Escherichia coli MKH13. From sequence analysis it is predicted to encode a protein of 595 amino acids. This protein shares 36% identity with the choline transport system BetT and 28% identity with the carnitine transport system CaiT of E. coli, as well as 38% identity with a protein with an unknown function from Haemophilus influenzae. Analysis of hydropathy indicated a common structure for all four transport proteins. After heterologous expression of betP in E. coli MKH13, the measured Km values for glycine betaine and the cotransported Na+ were similar to those found in C. glutamicum, whereas the modulation of activity by osmotic gradients was shifted to lower osmotic values.
TI  - The C terminus of the AddA subunit of the Bacillus subtilis ATP-dependent DNase is required for the ATP-dependent exonuclease activity but not for the helicase activity.
AB  - Comparison of subunit AddA of the Bacillus subtilis AddAB enzyme, subunit RecB of the Escherichia coli RecBCD enzyme, and subunit RecB of the Haemophilus influenzae RecBCD enzyme revealed several regions of homology. Whereas the first seven regions are common among helicases, the two C-terminally located regions are unique for RecB of E. coli and H. influenzae and AddA. Deletion of the C-terminal region resulted in the production of an enzyme which showed moderately impaired levels of ATP-dependent helicase activity, whereas the ATP-dependent exonuclease activity was completely destroyed. The mutant enzyme was almost completely capable of complementing E. coli recBCD and B. subtilis addAB strains with respect to DNA repair and homologous recombination. These results strongly suggest that at least part of the C-terminal region of the AddA protein is indispensable for exonuclease activity and that, in contrast to the exonuclease activity, the helicase activity of the addAB gene product is important for DNA repair and homologous recombination.
TI  - Three transport systems for the osmoprotectant glycine betaine operate in Bacillus subtilis: characterization of OpuD.
AB  - The accumulation of the osmoprotectant glycine betaine from exogenous sources provides a high degree of osmotic tolerance to Bacillus subtilis. We have identified, through functional complementation of an Escherichia coli mutant defective in glycine betaine uptake, a new glycine betaine transport system from B. subtilis. The DNA sequence of a 2,310-bp segment of the cloned region revealed a single gene (opuD) whose product (OpuD) was essential for glycine betaine uptake and osmoprotection in E. coli. The opuD gene encodes a hydrophobic 56.13-kDa protein (512 amino acid residues). OpuD shows a significant degree of sequence identity to the choline transporter BetT and the carnitine transporter CaiT from E. coli and a BetT-like protein from Haemophilus influenzae. These membrane proteins form a family of transporters involved in the uptake of trimethylammonium compounds. The OpuD-mediated glycine betaine transport activity in B. subtilis is controlled by the environmental osmolarity. High osmolarity stimulates de novo synthesis of OpuD and activates preexisting OpuD proteins to achieve maximal glycine betaine uptake activity. An opuD mutant was constructed by marker replacement, and the OpuD-mediated glycine betaine uptake activity was compared with that of the previously identified multicomponent OpuA and OpuC (ProU) glycine betaine uptake systems. In addition, a set of mutants was constructed, each of which synthesized only one of the three glycine betaine uptake systems. These mutants were used to determine the kinetic parameters for glycine betaine transport through OpuA, OpuC, and OpuD. Each of these uptake systems shows high substrate affinity, with Km values in the low micromolar range, which should allow B. subtilis to efficiently acquire the osmoprotectant from the environment. The systems differed in their contribution to the overall glycine betaine accumulation and osmoprotection. A triple opuA, opuC, and opuD mutant strain was isolated, and it showed no glycine betaine uptake activity, demonstrating that three transport systems for this osmoprotectant operate in B. subtilis.
TI  - Identification of an outer membrane protein involved in utilization of hemoglobin-haptoglobin complexes by nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - A recombinant plasmid containing a 6.5-kb fragment of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) chromosomal DNA was shown to confer a hemoglobin-haptoglobin-binding phenotype on Escherichia coli. Use of a mini-Tn10kan transposon for random insertion mutagenesis of this recombinant plasmid allowed localization of the NTHI DNA responsible for this hemoglobin-haptoglobin-binding phenotype to a 3.5-kb PstI-XhoI fragment within the 6.5-kb NTHI DNA insert. When this mutagenized NTHI DNA fragment was used to transform the wild-type NTHI strain, the resultant kanamycin-resistant mutant exhibited significantly decreased abilities to bind hemoglobin-haptoglobin and utilize it as a source of heme for aerobic growth in vitro. This mutant also lacked expression of a 115-kDa outer membrane protein that was present in the wild-type parent strain. Transformation of this mutant with wild-type NTHI chromosomal DNA restored the abilities to bind and utilize hemoglobin-haptoglobin and to express the 115-kDa outer membrane protein. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the relevant NTHI DNA revealed the presence of a gene, designated hhuA, that encoded a predicted 117,145-Da protein. The HhuA protein exhibited features typical of a TonB-dependent outer membrane receptor and had significant identity with the hemoglobin receptors of both Haemophilus ducreyi and Neisseria meningitidis.
TI  - The monofunctional glycosyltransferase of Escherichia coli is a member of a new class of peptidoglycan-synthesising enzymes.
AB  - Using conserved fingerprints in the glycosyltransferase (GTase) domain of high-molecular-weight penicillin-binding proteins (PBP), a gene (mgt) encoding a putative monofunctional glycosyltransferase has been identified in Haemophilus influenzae and in other bacteria] species. Here we report the cloning of the homologous Escherichia coli gene and show that the solubilised membrane fraction of E. coli cells overexpressing the mgt gene contain a significantly increased peptidoglycan synthesis activity. In contrast to the high-molecular-weight PBPs, this activity is not inhibited by Flavomycin.
TI  - Molecular cloning and overexpression of a glutathione transferase gene from Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - The structural gene of the Proteus mirabilis glutathione transferase GSTB1-1 (gstB) has been isolated from genomic DNA. A nucleotide sequence determination of gstB predicted a translational product of 203 amino acid residues, perfectly matching the sequence of the previously purified protein [Mignogna, Allocati, Aceto, Piccolomini, Di Ilio, Barra and Martini (1993) Eur. J. Biochem. 211, 421-425]. The P. mirabilis GST sequence revealed 56% identity with the Escherichia coli GST at DNA level and 54% amino acid identity. Similarity has been revealed also with the translation products of the recently cloned gene bphH from Haemophilus influenzae (28% identity) and ORF3 of Burkholderia cepacia (27% identity). Putative promoter sequences with high similarity to the E. coli sigma 70 consensus promoter and to promoters of P. mirabilis cat and glnA genes preceded the ATG of the gstB open reading frame (ORF). gstB was brought under control of the tac promoter and overexpressed in E. coli by induction with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside and growth at 37 degrees C. The physicochemical and catalytic properties of overexpressed protein were indistinguishable from those of the enzyme purified from P. mirabilis extract. Unlike the GST belonging to Mu and Theta classes, GSTB1-1 was unable to metabolize dichloromethane. The study of the interaction of cloned GSTB1-1 with a number of antibiotics indicates that this enzyme actively participates in the binding of tetracyclines and rifamycin.
TI  - Computational comparisons of model genomes.
AB  - Complete genomes from model organisms provide new challenges for computational molecular biology. Novel questions emerge from the genome data obtained from the functional prediction of thousands of gene products. In this review, we present some approaches to the computational comparison of genomes, based on sequence and text analysis, and comparisons of genome composition and gene order.
TI  - [Study on septicaemia in infants and children in the past 20 years. Part 2. An analysis of factors that prescribe for the prognosis].
AB  - Underlying diseases, complications, clinical findings, and laboratory findings were evaluated in 158 cases of septicaemia admitted to Jikei University Hospital from 1975 to 1994, in order to conjectured factors that prescribe for the prognosis. 50% of the patients had underlying diseases. Malignancy including leukaemia (31 cases, 39.2%) was the most common underlying disease, followed by low birth weight infant (17 cases, 21.5%), aplastic anemia (9 case, 11.4%), and congenital heart disease (7 cases, 8.9%). The death rate for patients with underlying disease (27.8%) was significantly greater than the mortality for normal patients with septicaemia (8.9%) (p < 0.05). Meningitis (24.7%) was the most common complication, followed by DIC (19.6%), shock (15.2%), and pneumonia (10.8%). The mortality rate of septicaemia complicated by shock was 66.7% (p < 0.01), and that complicated by DIC was 45.2% (p < 0.01). The mortality rate for patients with the clinical findings of respiratory distress, cough, abdominal distention, cyanosis, splenomegaly, or peripheral coldness was more than 40% and significantly greater (p < 0.01). Mortality rate in patients with granulocyte counts of < 4.000/mm3, platelet counts of < 5 x 10(4)/ mm3, total protein of < 5.0 g/dl, or ESR of < 20 mm/hr were significantly greater (p < 0.01) than those in patients with normal laboratory findings. Coincidence rate of blood and stool cultures was 57.9% for E. coli, and 28.6% for Klebsiella sp., and that of blood and throat cultures was more than 30% for Pseudomonas sp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus. In the study of antimicrobial susceptibility for microorganisms isolated, the number of drug resistant S. aureus had increased in the last 10 years.
TI  - [Study on septicaemia in infants and children in the past 20 years. Part 1. An analysis of causal organisms].
AB  - Causal organisms and their changes were evaluated in 158 cases of septicaemia admitted to Jikei University Hospital from 1975 to 1994. Eighty patients (50.6%) were aged less than 1 year, and 37 patients (23.4%) were newborns. The average mortality rate was 18.4%. The mortality rate between 1975 and 1984 was 26.8%, and that of the past 10 years (from 1985 to 1994) decreased to 13.7%. Staphylococcus aureus (29 cases, 19.4%) was the most common pathogens isolated, followed by Pseudomonas sp. (24 cases, 15.2%), Escherichia coli (19 cases, 12.0%), and Haemophilus influenzae (18 cases, 11.4%). H. influenzae, Acinetobacter sp., Streptococcus pneumoniae and Group B streptococcus (GBS) increased in the past 10 years (from 1985 to 1994), compared with the preceding 10 years (from 1975 to 1984). The mortality rate of Klebsiella sp. septicaemia (28.6%) was highest, followed by Pseudomonas sp. (25.0%), S. aureus (24.1%), S. pneumoniae (22.2%). H. influenzae and Acinetobacter sp. septicaemia were not fatal. E. coli and GBS were common among neonates and patients aged less than 1 year. H. influenzae septicaemia occurred mainly in patients with meningitis, in those younger than school age. Acinetobacter sp. was common among neonates and children with leukaemia Pseudomonas sp., Klebsiella sp., and Acinetobacter sp. were mainly detected in patients with underlying diseases. E. coli, H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and GBS were mainly detected in patients without underlying diseases.
TI  - Mechanisms of bacterial antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Infectious complications are major contributing factors to morbidity and mortality in the ICU setting. Organisms frequently encountered in the ICU include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae (particularly in trauma victims), enterococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter baumanii, Escherichia coli, and Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia. Antibiotics have played a major role in the treatment of infections caused by such bacterial pathogens. Organisms have responded to the antibiotic challenge, however, evolving and developing resistance to all available antimicrobial agents to a greater or lesser degree. Specific mechanisms of resistance include reductions in cell-wall membrane permeability, alterations of antimicrobial agent target sites, enzymatic inactivation of antibiotics, and development of bypass pathways around antimicrobial targets. This article describes, pathogen by pathogen, antimicrobial agents that are useful for the treatment of infection in the ICU setting and the mechanisms whereby bacteria have short-circuited our antimicrobial armamentarium.
TI  - Sequence and organization of genes encoding enzymes involved in pyruvate metabolism in Mycoplasma capricolum.
AB  - The region of the genome of Mycoplasma capricolum upstream of the portion encompassing the genes for Enzymes I and IIAglc of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) was cloned and sequenced. Examination of the sequence revealed open reading frames corresponding to numerous genes involved with the oxidation of pyruvate. The deduced gene organization is naox (encoding NADH oxidase)-lplA (encoding lipoate-protein ligase)-odpA (encoding pyruvate dehydrogenase EI alpha)-odpB (encoding pyruvate dehydrogenase EI beta)-odp2(encoding pyruvate dehydrogenase EII)-dldH (encoding dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase)-pta (encoding phosphotransacetylase)-ack (encoding acetate kinase)-orfA (an unknown open reading frame)-kdtB-ptsI-crr. Analysis of the DNA sequence suggests that the naox and lplA genes are part of a single operon, odpA and odpB constitute an additional operon, odp2 and dldH a third operon, and pta and ack an additional transcription unit. Phylogenetic analyses of the protein products of the odpA and odpB genes indicate that they are most similar to the corresponding proteins from Mycoplasma genitalium, Acholeplasma laidlawii, and Gram-positive organisms. The product of the odp2 gene contains a single lipoyl domain, as is the case with the corresponding proteins from M. genitalium and numerous other organisms. An evolutionary tree places the M. capricolum odp2 gene product in close relationship to the corresponding proteins from A. laidlawii and M.genitalium. The dldH gene encodes an unusual form of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase that contains an aminoterminal extension corresponding to a lipoyl domain, a property shared by the corresponding proteins from Alcaligenes eutrophus and Clostridium magnum. Aside from that feature, the protein is related phylogenetically to the corresponding proteins from A. laidlawii and M. genitalium. The phosphotransacetylase from M. capricolum is related most closely to the corresponding protein from M. genitalium and is distinguished easily from the enzymes from Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae by the absence of the characteristic amino-terminal extension. The acetate kinase from M. capricolum is related evolutionarily to the homologous enzyme from M. genitalium. Map position comparisons of genes encoding proteins involved with pyruvate metabolism show that, whereas all the genes are clustered in M. capricolum, they are scattered in M. genitalium.
TI  - Gene order is not conserved in bacterial evolution.

TI  - Cloning of a Neisseria meningitidis gene for L-lactate dehydrogenase (L-LDH): evidence for a second meningococcal L-LDH with different regulation.
AB  - We report the cloning of lldA, a Neisseria meningitidis gene for L-lactate dehydrogenase (L-LDH). Escherichia coli contains a single L-LDH gene (lldD) in the lld operon (previously lct). E. coli grown in complex media does not have L-LDH activity, but the activity is induced by growth in defined medium with L-lactate as the carbon source. In contrast, meningococci contain at least one L-LDH in addition to the lldA gene product. These enzymes are active in meningococci grown in complex media and are not dependent on growth in L-lactate. The predicted amino acid sequence of lldA is homologous to that of E. coli lldD and of other prokaryotic and eukaryotic flavin mononucleotide-containing enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of L-lactate and other small alpha-hydroxy acids. A mutant with a deletion in lldA was found to have reduced L-LDH activity. However, this mutant was able to grow on L-lactate, indicating that a second L-LDH must exist. Activity of the lldA enzyme was affected by growth conditions, being increased by growth on a defined medium with either L-lactate or pyruvate as the carbon source. For meningococci grown on a complex medium, activity of the lldA enzyme was increased by growth on plates or in well-aerated broth. A second L-lactate-oxidizing activity was seen in bacteria grown in poorly aerated broth. Neisseria gonorrhoeae contains a homolog of lldA. As for meningococci, mutation of the gonococcal lldA reduced L-LDH activity but did not affect growth on L-lactate.
TI  - Cloning of a DNA fragment encoding a heme-repressible hemoglobin-binding outer membrane protein from Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae is able to use hemoglobin as a sole source of heme, and heme-repressible hemoglobin binding to the cell surface has been demonstrated. Using an affinity purification methodology, a hemoglobin-binding protein of approximately 120 kDa was isolated from H. influenzae type b strain HI689 grown in heme-restricted but not in heme-replete conditions. The isolated protein was subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing, and the derived amino acid sequence was used to design corresponding oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotides were used to probe a Southern blot of EcoRI-digested HI689 genomic DNA. A hybridizing band of approximately 4.2 kb was successfully cloned into pUC19. Using a 1.9-kb internal BglII fragment of the 4.2-kb clone as a probe, hybridization was seen in both typeable and nontypeable H. influenzae but not in other bacterial species tested. Following partial nucleotide sequencing of the 4.2-kb insert, a putative open reading frame was subcloned into an expression vector. The host Escherichia coli strain in which the cloned fragment was expressed bound biotinylated human hemoglobin, whereas binding of hemoglobin was not detected in E. coli with the vector alone. In conclusion, we hypothesize that the DNA fragment encoding an approximately 120-kDa heme-repressible hemoglobin-binding protein mediates one step in the acquisition of hemoglobin by H. influenzae in vivo.
TI  - A new gene locus of Bordetella pertussis defines a novel family of prokaryotic transcriptional accessory proteins.
AB  - Recently, a novel type of regulatory mutation causing differential effects on the expression of virulence genes due to a slight overexpression of the RNA polymerase alpha subunit (RpoA) was found in Bordetella pertussis (N. H. Carbonetti, T. M. Fuchs, A. A. Patamawenu, T. J. Irish, H. Deppisch, and R. Gross, J. Bacteriol. 176:7267-7273, 1994). To gather information on the molecular events behind this phenomenon, we isolated suppressor mutants of the RpoA-overexpressing strains after random mutagenesis. Genetic characterization of these suppressor strains revealed the existence of at least three distinct groups of dominant alleles. Mutations occurred either in the rpoA locus itself, in the bvg locus, or in unknown gene loci. One mutant of the latter group was further characterized. By the introduction of a cosmid library containing genomic B. pertussis DNA into this suppressor strain, we isolated a cosmid which suppressed the phenotype of the suppressor strain, thus restoring the negative effect on transcription of the ptx and cya toxin genes. Mutagenesis of the cosmid with Tn5 led to the identification of the gene locus responsible for this phenomenon. Its DNA sequence revealed the presence of an open reading frame (ORF) consisting of 2,373 bp coding for a hypothetical 86-kDa protein with extensive sequence similarities to ORFs with not yet identified functions of Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The new gene, termed tex, for toxin expression, seems to be an essential factor for B. pertussis, as it cannot be deleted from the bacterial chromosome. All members of this new protein family show significant sequence similarities with the mannitol repressor protein MtlR and with the presumptive RNA-binding domains of the Pnp and ribosomal S1 proteins of E. coli in their N- and C-terminal parts, respectively. These sequence similarities and the fact that the tex gene was isolated by virtue of its effects on gene expression in B. pertussis indicate that the members of this new protein family may play an important role in the transcription machinery of prokaryotic organisms.
TI  - Identification of the pdxK gene that encodes pyridoxine (vitamin B6) kinase in Escherichia coli K-12.
AB  - We isolated a miniTn10(Cmr) insertion mutant lacking pyridoxine (PN) kinase and cloned the structural gene, designated pdxK, by complementation. P1 transduction and PCR mapping and DNA sequence analysis showed that pdxK was adjacent to the crr sugar transport gene (53.95 min). Growth properties of pdxK::miniTn10 mutants supported the hypotheses that PN kinase, which also phosphorylates pyridoxal (PL) and pyridoxamine (PM) in vitro, functions solely in the B6-vitamer salvage pathway and that E. coli contains an additional PL kinase. The amino acid sequence of PdxK has signature motifs of the PfkB superfamily of carbohydrate kinases, which includes phosphofructokinases and ribokinases, and suggests that three unidentified ORFs of Salmonella typhimurium, Haemophilus influenzae, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae correspond to PN/PL/PM kinases.
TI  - Cloning and analysis of the genes encoding the type IIS restriction-modification  system HphI from Haemophilus parahaemolyticus.
AB  - The genomic region encoding the type IIS restriction-modification (R-M) system HphI (enzymes recognizing the asymmetric sequence 5'-GGTGA-3'/5'-TCACC-3') from Haemophilus parahaemolyticus were cloned into Escherichia coli and sequenced. Sequence analysis of the R-M HphI system revealed three adjacent genes aligned in the same orientation: a cytosine 5 methyltransferase (gene hphIMC), an adenine N6 methyltransferase (hphIMA) and the HphI restriction endonuclease (gene hphIR). Either methyltransferase is capable of protecting plasmid DNA in vivo against the action of the cognate restriction endonuclease. hphIMA methylation renders plasmid DNA resistant to R.Hindill at overlapping sites, suggesting that the adenine methyltransferase modifies the 3'-terminal A residue on the GGTGA strand. Strong homology was found between the N-terminal part of the m6A methyltransferasease and an unidentified reading frame interrupted by an incomplete gaIE gene of Neisseria meningitidis. The HphI R-M genes are flanked by a copy of a 56 bp direct nucleotide repeat on each side. Similar sequences have also been identified in the non-coding regions of H.influenzae Rd DNA. Possible involvement of the repeat sequences in the mobility of the HphI R-M system is discussed.
TI  - Escherichia coli contains a protein that is homologous in function and N-terminal sequence to the protein encoded by the nifS gene of Azotobacter vinelandii and that can participate in the synthesis of the Fe-S cluster of dihydroxy-acid dehydratase.
AB  - In this paper, I report the purification of a protein from Escherichia coli that  is very similar in sequence, molecular weight, and the reactions it can catalyze to the protein encoded by the Azotobacter vinelandii nifS gene. This E. coli protein contains pyridoxal phosphate as a cofactor and catalyzes the removal of sulfur from cysteine to form alanine and S0. When dithiothreitol is present along with cysteine, the S0 formed is reduced to S2-. This protein has a reactive sulfhydryl group that is essential for activity. As isolated, this sulfhydryl group appears to be in a disulfide linkage with the sulfhydryl group from the phosphopantetheine moiety of the acyl carrier protein. The purified E. coli protein can mobilize the sulfur from cysteine and contribute it to the formation of a [4Fe-4S] cluster on the apoprotein of E. coli dihydroxy-acid dehydratase. A mechanism is proposed for the early stages of the synthesis of Fe-S clusters using this protein and sulfur in the S0 oxidation state.
TI  - Purification and characterization of the integrase from the Haemophilus influenzae bacteriophage HP1; identification of a four-stranded intermediate and the order of strand exchange.
AB  - The integrase encoded by the temperate phage HP1 promotes the site-specific recombination between DNA sites on its genome (the attP site) and on the genome of the host Haemophilus influenzae (the attB site). The protein has been overproduced in Escherichia coli, and purified to apparent homogeneity. HP1 integrase promotes recombination of supercoiled attP-containing molecules with linear segments with attB sites. Reaction was enhanced by spermidine and by the bacterial DNA-bending protein integration host factor. The rate of recombination showed complex and related dependence upon the integrase concentration and the concentration of the supercoiled attP substrate. These relationships probably originate from the need to assemble a multi-protein complex on the attP DNA. The reaction promoted by HP1 integrase produced a four-stranded initial reaction product in which one pair of DNA strands had undergone transfer while the other pair remained intact. This four-stranded component was produced more rapidly than any product, and its steady-state level was proportional to the overall rate of reaction. This component had the kinetic and structural properties of an intermediate in the recombination reaction. The existence of this intermediate was used to determine that the two strand exchanges required for recombination of the duplex substrates proceed in a defined order.
TI  - Early-onset sepsis in very low birth weight neonates: a report from the National  Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Early-onset sepsis (occurring within 72 hours of birth) is included in the differential diagnosis of most very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates. To determine the current incidence of early-onset sepsis, risk factors for disease, and the impact of early-onset sepsis on subsequent hospital course, we studied a cohort of 7861 VLBW neonates (401 to 1500 gm) admitted to the 12 National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network centers during a 32-month period (1991-1993). METHODS: The NICHD Neonatal Research Network maintains a prospectively collected registry on all VLBW neonates born or cared for at participating centers. Data from this registry were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Blood culture-proven early-onset sepsis was uncommon, occurring in only 1.9% of VLBW neonates. Group B streptococcus was the most frequent pathogen associated with early-onset sepsis (31%), followed by Escherichia coli (16%) and Haemophilus influenzae (12%). Decreasing gestational age was associated with increased rates of infection. Antibiotic therapy for suspected sepsis is frequently initiated at birth in VLBW neonates. Almost half of the infants in this cohort were considered to have clinical sepsis and continued to receive antibiotics for 5 or more days, despite a negative blood culture result in 98% of cases. These findings underscore the difficulty of ruling out sepsis in the symptomatic immature neonate and the special concern for culture-negative clinical sepsis in the face of maternal antibiotic use. Neonates with early-onset sepsis were significantly more likely to have subsequent comorbidities, including severe intraventricular hemorrhage, patent ductus arteriosus, and prolonged assisted ventilation. Although 26% of VLBW neonates with early-onset sepsis died, only 4% of the 950 deaths that occurred in the first 72 hours of life were attributed to infection. For those infants discharged alive, early-onset sepsis was associated with a significantly prolonged hospital stay (86 vs 69 days; p <0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Early-onset sepsis remains an important but uncommon problem among VLBW preterm infants. Improved diagnostic strategies are needed to enable the clinician to distinguish between the infected and the uninfected VLBW neonate with symptoms and to target continued antibiotic therapy to those who are truly infected.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the catalase gene of Neisseria gonorrhoeae: use of the gonococcus as a host organism for recombinant DNA.
AB  - The structural gene for the catalase of Neisseria gonorrhoeae was cloned into a Kat- strain of that organism by using a recombinant vector derived from one of the beta-lactamase-specifying plasmids found in that organism. The kat gene was then successfully subcloned into both pUC8 and pGB2, transformed into Escherichia coli, and shown to complement the E. coli katE mutants UM2 and UMRl. The gene was subsequently mutagenized and returned to the gonococcus to generate a Kat- strain that was phenotypically identical to the strain originally used to clone the gene. The sequence of the gene and the derived amino acid sequence showed that the gonococcal kat gene closely resembles the hktE gene of Haemophilus influenzae. The sequence of the promoter region of the gonococcal kat gene is unusual and may explain the extremely high, loosely regulated expression of the gene.
TI  - A novel DnaJ-like protein in Escherichia coli inserts into the cytoplasmic membrane with a type III topology.
AB  - We describe a novel Escherichia coli protein, DjlA, containing a highly conserved J-region motif, which is present in the DnaJ protein chaperone family and required for interaction with DnaK. Remarkably, DjlA is shown to be a membrane protein, localized to the inner membrane with the unusual Type III topology (N-out, C-in). Thus, DjlA appears to present an extremely short N-terminus to the periplasm and has a single transmembrane domain (TMD) and a large cytoplasmic domain containing the C-terminal J-region. Analysis of the TMD of DjlA and recently identified homologues in Coxiella burnetti and Haemophilus influenzae revealed a striking pattern of conserved glycines (or rarely alanine), with a four-residue spacing. This motif, predicted to form a spiral groove in the TMD, is more marked than a repeating glycine motif, implicated in the dimerization of TMDs of some eukaryotic proteins. This feature of DjlA could represent a promiscuous docking mechanism for interaction with a variety of membrane proteins. DjlA null mutants can be isolated but these appear rapidly to accumulate suppressors to correct envelope and growth defects. Moderate (10-fold) overproduction of DjlA suppresses a mutation in FtsZ but markedly perturbs cell division and cell-envelope growth in minimal medium. We propose that DjlA plays a role in the correct assembly, activity and/or maintenance of a number of membrane proteins, including two-component signal-transduction systems.
TI  - Effect of Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine in combination with peroral immunization with Escherichia coli on experimental otitis media.
AB  - The protective ability of a conjugated Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, ACT-HIB, used singly or in combination with orally administered Escherichia coli, was investigated in a rat model for acute otitis media. The humoral response to ACT-HIB was also analyzed. The study demonstrated that ACT-HIB vaccination resulted in a prompt antibody response, and that ACT-HIB was efficient in preventing middle ear infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b. The efficiency increased if the vaccine was combined with Escherichia coli. The results suggest that Escherichia coli could possibly be useful in the future as a vaccine vehicle, and since Haemophilus influenzae acute mastoiditis seems to be almost exclusively due to serotype b, the incidence of this infection may be reduced with the conjugated Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of an Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae outer membrane protein belonging to the family of PAL lipoproteins.
AB  - A 14-kDa outer membrane protein (OMP) was purified from Actinobacillus pleuro-pneumoniae serotype 2. The protein strongly reacts with sera from pigs experimentally or naturally infected with any of the 12 serotypes of A. pleuropneumoniae. The gene encoding this protein was isolated from a gene library of A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 2 reference strain by immunoscreening. Expression of the cloned gene in Escherichia coli revealed that the protein is also located in the outer membrane fraction of the recombinant host. DNA sequence analysis of the gene reveals high similarity of the protein's amino acid sequence to that of the E. coli peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein PAL, to the Haemophilus influenzae OMP P6 and to related proteins of several other Gram-negative bacteria. We have therefore named the 14-kDa protein PalA, and its corresponding gene, palA. The 20 amino-terminal amino acid residues of PalA constitute a signal sequence characteristic of membrane lipoproteins of prokaryotes with a recognition site for the signal sequence peptidase II and a sorting signal for the final localization of the mature protein in the outer membrane. The DNA sequence upstream of palA contains an open reading frame which is highly similar to the E. coli tolB gene, indicating a gene cluster in A. pleuropneumoniae which is very similar to the E. coli tol locus. The palA gene is conserved and expressed in all A. pleuropneumoniae serotypes and in A. lignieresii. A very similar palA gene is present in A. suis and A. equuli.
TI  - The conserved 18,000-molecular-weight outer membrane protein of Haemophilus ducreyi has homology to PAL.
AB  - Haemophilus ducreyi expresses an 18,000-molecular-weight outer membrane protein that contains a conserved surface-exposed epitope recognized by monoclonal antibody 3B9. Monoclonal antibody 3B9 cross-reacts with proteins of similar molecular weight found in many Haemophilus sp. strains, including P6, a candidate vaccine for Haemophilus influenzae. The gene encoding the 18,000-molecular-weight outer membrane protein was identified by screening a lambdagt11 genomic library with 3B9. The coding sequence of the gene was localized to a 471-bp open reading frame, designated pal (peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein). Translation of pal predicted a mature polypeptide with a molecular weight of 15,000 that had extensive homology with P6 and Escherichia coli PAL. The predicted signal peptide had features characteristic of a prokaryotic lipoprotein, and processing of PAL was sensitive to globomycin in H. ducreyi. The sequences encoding mature H. ducreyi PAL were subcloned into the vector pRSET B and expressed as a polyhistidine-containing fusion protein that bound 3B9. In Western blot (immunoblot) analysis, serum samples obtained from healthy subjects and patients with chancroid or other genital ulcer diseases contained antibodies to purified PAL. Antibodies that bound to PAL were removed by absorption with a lysate of Haemophilus sp. antigens, suggesting that patients with chancroid do not develop an H. ducreyi-specific antibody response to PAL.
TI  - Genes associated with meningococcal capsule complex are also found in Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  - A homolog of the meningococcal cps locus region E has been identified in Neisseria gonorrhoeae immediately upstream of the gonococcal region D locus. Region E has no detectable function in capsule biosynthesis in Neisseria meningitidis or in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis in either organism. The open reading frame is homologous to proteins of unknown function in Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae. Further analysis of the N. meningitidis cps cluster has identified a second copy of region D encoding three additional open reading frames, including homologs of DNA methyltransferases. The organization of the region D and E genes in N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis in relation to the cps genes provides some insight into the evolutionary origin of encapsulation in N. meningitidis.
TI  - Molecular cloning of the Haemophilus influenzae gmhA (lpcA) gene encoding a phosphoheptose isomerase required for lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis.
AB  - We have determined that gene HI#1181 of Haemophilus influenzae is a homolog of Escherichia coli gmhA (previously designated lpcA) (J. S. Brooke and M. A. Valvano, J. Biol. Chem. 271:3608-3614, 1996), which encodes a phosphoheptose isomerase catalyzing the first step of the biosynthesis of ADP-L-glycero-D-manno heptose. Mutations in this gene are associated with a heptoseless core lipopolysaccharide which determines an increased outer membrane permeability to hydrophobic compounds. The cloned H. influenzae gmhA restored the synthesis of a complete core in the gmhA-deleted E. coli strain chi711. Amino acid sequence comparisons of the GmhA proteins of E. coli and H. influenzae with other proteins in the databases revealed the existence of a novel family of phosphosugar a1do-keto isomerases.
TI  - Sequences of the Salmonella typhimurium mglA and mglC genes.
AB  - The nucleotide sequences of the mglA and mglC genes of Salmonella typhimurium (St) LT2 have been determined. The deduced amino acid (aa) sequences of MglA and MglC are 506 and 302 aa long with predicted molecular masses of 56,484 and 31,551 Da, respectively. The aa sequences of St MglA and MglC are homologous to the corresponding Mgl proteins of Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Treponema pallidum and Mycoplasma genitalium. The order of the St mgl operon is mglBAC.
TI  - Characterization of two transposon mutants from Haemophilus influenzae type b with altered lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis.
AB  - Two isogenic mutants of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) strain A2 were prepared by random m-Tn3(Cm) insertions into the 7.4-kb lsg (lipooligosaccharide synthesis genes) region of Hib DNA, which consists of seven complete and one partial open reading frame (orfs). Compared to the parent A2 strain which produces a complex mixture of lipooligosaccharides (LOS), the mutant strains 281.25 and 276.4 produced only a few LOS species. The precise locations of transposon insertions into the lsg loci of these mutants were determined (base 3546 in orf 4 for strain 281.25 and base 4402 in orf 5 for strain 276.4), and the effects of these mutations on LOS biosynthesis and epitope expression were evaluated. When the O-deacylated LOS were analyzed by mass spectrometry, both strains contained major LOS species of M(r) 2601, 2439, and 2277, which consisted of a common heptose trisaccharide core structure [Hep3(PEA)Kdo(P)-lipid A, where Hep is L-glycero-D-manno-heptose, Kdo is 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid, and PEA is phosphoethanolamine] and four, three, or two hexoses, respectively. These species represent the smallest components of the wild-type LOS mixture. The major LOS oligosaccharide obtained from the strain 281.25 by mild acid hydrolysis was dephosphorylated and shown by composition analysis, methylation analysis, mass spectrometry, and 2D NMR studies to be a triantennary structure consisting of a heptose trisaccharide core with two glucose disaccharide branches: Hep alpha 1 --> (Glc beta 1 --> 4Glc alpha 1 --> 3) 2Hep alpha 1 --> (Glc beta 1 --> 4Glc beta 1 --> 4)3Hep alpha 1 --> anhydroKdo. Unlike the parent A2 strain, mutant strain 281.25 cannot add galactoses to the branches of this octasaccharide. Strain 276.4 is similarly deficient, except that it can still utilize a minor biosynthetic pathway leading to the addition of sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine.
TI  - A relA/spoT homologous gene from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) controls antibiotic biosynthetic genes.
AB  - A 0.972-kilobase pair DNA fragment from Streptomyces lividans that induces the production of the blue-pigmented antibiotic actinorhodine in S. lividans when cloned on a multicopy plasmid has led to the isolation of a 4-kilobase pair DNA fragment from Streptomyces coelicolor containing homologous sequence. Computer-assisted analysis of the DNA sequence revealed three putative open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3. ORF2 extends beyond the sequenced DNA fragment, and its deduced product shares no similarities with any other known proteins in the data bases. ORF3 is also truncated, and its 41-amino acid C-terminal product is identical to the S. coelicolor adenine phosphoribosyltransferase. The 847-amino acid ORF1 protein, with a predicted molecular mass of 94.2 kDa, strongly resembled the relA and spoT gene products from Escherichia coli and the homologs from Vibrio sp. strain S14, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus equisimilis H46A, and Mycoplasma genitalium. Unlike these proteins, the ORF1 amino acid sequence analysis revealed the presence of a putative ATP/GTP-binding domain. A mutant was generated by deleting most of the ORF1 gene that showed an actinorhodine-nonproducing phenotype, while undecylprodigiosin and the calcium-dependent antibiotic were unaffected. The mutant strain grew at a much lower rate than the wild-type strain, and spore formation was delayed. When the gene was propagated on a low copy number vector, not only was actinorhodine production restored, but actinorhodine and undecylprodigiosin production was enhanced in both the mutant and wild-type and morphological differentiation returned to wild-type characteristics. (p)ppGpp synthetase activity was not detected in purified ribosomes from the ORF1-deleted mutant, while it was restored by complementation of this strain.
TI  - Serum bactericidal activity of ceftizoxime and ceftriaxone against pathogens associated with community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonias.
AB  - The serum bactericidal activities of ceftizoxime and ceftriaxone against organisms commonly implicated in community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonias were studied. Ceftizoxime 1 g (as the sodium salt) every 12 hours for two doses and ceftriaxone 1 g (as the sodium salt) every 24 hours for two doses were administered to 20 healthy volunteers in a crossover fashion. Blood samples were drawn immediately before and 2,4,6,8,10, and 12 hours after the second ceftizoxime dose and immediately before and 8,12,16,18,20, and 24 hours after the second ceftriaxone dose. Serum drug concentrations were determined by validated high-performance liquid chromatography. Serum bactericidal titers were determined in duplicate for each serum sample against four clinical isolates of each of the following organisms: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens. The median duration of serum bactericidal activity during the dosage interval was significantly different between antimicrobial regimens only for S. pneumoniae (92% of the dosage interval for ceftizoxime, versus 100% for ceftriaxone). This difference does not appear to be clinically important since ceftizoxime provides adequate serum bactericidal activity for more than 50% of the dosage interval and its effectiveness against pneumococcal pneumonia has been supported in clinical trials. The ceftriaxone and ceftizoxime regimens did not differ significantly in their duration of serum bactericidal activity against six of the seven organisms tested.
TI  - An evaluation of the in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam.
AB  - Tazobactam is a new, irreversible inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases of staphylococci, plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of the TEM and SHV types found in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species and beta-lactamases of anerobes such as Bacteroides species. Its combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum ureido-penicillin, would be expected to improve the activity of piperacillin against staphylococci, TEM and SHV beta-lactamase producing Gram negative bacteria and anerobes. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of piperacillin/tazobactam were determined for 1952 individual patient isolates of Gram positive and negative bacteria causing significant infections and compared with MIC values for cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid. MICs were determined by agar dilution (NCCLS 1990 and 1992). Piperacillin/tazobactam had excellent activity against methicillin susceptible staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, enterococci and organisms of the Bacteroides fragilis group. It was also active against the majority of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates tested. It was not active against extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Klebsiella species and some high level TEM and SHV beta-lactamase producing E. coli and Klebsiella species. Activity against Gram negative organisms capable of producing chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases was good, since in most organisms tested, the enzymes were not induced in sufficient quantities to cause antibiotic resistance. However some Enterobacter species were derepressed hyperproducing mutants; these isolates showed resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam since tazobactam does not inhibit these Class I beta lactamases. Activity was superior to ticarcillin/clavulanic acid for Gram negative rods. Imipenem was the most active agent against ESBL producing Klebsiella species. Piperacillin/tazobactam has a suitable spectrum of activity in vitro to suggest its use in monotherapy of mixed anerobic infections, mixed respiratory infections such as aspiration pneumonia and, in combination with an aminoglycoside, it would provide Gram positive as well as Gram negative cover of febrile episodes in immunosuppressed patients.
TI  - Bronchoalveolar lavage or oropharyngeal cultures to identify lower respiratory pathogens in infants with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - As collections of lower respiratory tract specimens from young children with cystic fibrosis (CF) are difficult, we determined whether oropharyngeal cultures predicted lower airway pathogens. During 1992-1994, 75 of 90 (83%) infants with CF diagnosed by neonatal screening had 150 simultaneous bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and oropharyngeal specimens collected for quantitative bacterial culture at a mean age of 17 months (range, 1-52). Ten children undergoing bronchoscopy for stridor served as controls. Total and differential cell counts and interleukin-8 concentrations were measured in BAL fluid. A subset of bacterial pathogens were typed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. A non-linear relationship with inflammatory markers supported a diagnosis of lower airway infection when > or = 10(5) colony-forming units/ml were detected. This criterion was met in 47 (31%) BAL cultures from 37 (49%) children. Staphylococcus aureus (19%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11%), and Hemophilus influenzae (8%) were the major lower airway pathogens. In oropharyngeal cultures, S. aureus (47%), Escherichia coli (23%), H. influenzae (15%), and P. aeruginosa (13%) predominated. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of oropharyngeal cultures for pathogens causing lower respiratory infections were 82%, 83%, 41%, and 97%, respectively. When there was agreement between paired oropharyngeal and BAL cultures, genetic fingerprinting showed some strains of the same organism were unrelated. We conclude that oropharyngeal cultures do not reliably predict the presence of bacterial pathogens in the lower airways of young CF children.
TI  - Penetration and bactericidal activity of cefixime in synovial fluid.
AB  - The penetration of oral cefixime into the synovial fluids of 16 patients (mean age, 50.6 years) who underwent joint taps for rheumatic noninfectious disorders was examined. The patients were each given a single dose (400 mg) 2 to 24 h prior to the tap. Cefixime concentrations in serum and joint fluid samples were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography, and the bactericidal activities of these fluids against three isolates each of Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli were examined. The highest concentrations in serum and synovial fluid were achieved 4 h following drug intake, the mean values being 2.8 and 2.03 micrograms/ml, respectively. Effective bactericidal activities (bactericidal titer, > 1:2) against E. coli and H. influenzae were demonstrated in serum and joint fluid up to 10 h following oral intake of cefixime. These results suggest that cefixime penetrates well into joint fluid, achieving levels above the MIC for E. coli lasting as long as 10 h and levels above the MIC for H. influenzae lasting up to 24 h after administration. Good bactericidal activity against susceptible bacterial isolates was observed for at least 10 h after dosing.
TI  - Asymmetric substitution patterns in the two DNA strands of bacteria.
AB  - Analyses of the genomes of three prokaryotes, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Haemophilus influenzae, revealed a new type of genomic compartmentalization of base frequencies. There was a departure from intrastrand equifrequency between A and T or between C and G, showing that the substitution patterns of the two strands of DNA were asymmetric. The positions of the boundaries between these compartments were found to coincide with the origin and terminus of chromosome replication, and there were more A-T and C-G deviations in intergenic regions and third codon positions, suggesting that a mutational bias was responsible for this asymmetry. The strand asymmetry was found to be due to a difference in base compositions of transcripts in the leading and lagging strands. This difference is sufficient to affect codon usage, but it is small compared to the effects of gene expressivity and amino-acid composition.
TI  - Comparison of sulbactam/ampicillin and cefuroxime in infections of the lower respiratory tract: results of a prospective, randomized and comparative study.
AB  - In a randomized, prospective study, ampicillin (AMP) in combination with the beta-lactamase-inhibitor sulbactam (SBT) was compared with cefuroxime (CXM) in 73 hospitalized patients with lower respiratory tract infections. Of these patients 36 received SBT/AMP 1 g/2 g tid and 37 received CXM 1.5 g tid - both in the form of intravenous infusion. The duration of treatment ranged from 5 to 12 days, with a median of 8 days in each group. In the SBT/AMP group, 23 patients (64%) had pneumonia, while 13 (36%) had acute purulent bronchitis; 13 of the patients (36%) received artificial respiration. In the CXM group, 23 patients (62%) had pneumonia and 14 (38%) acute purulent bronchitis; eight patients (22%) required artificial respiration. In 54 patients (SBT/AMP: 26; CXM: 28), initial culture yielded bacterial pathogens, mainly Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and pneumococci. In each group, 35 patients were clinically evaluable. Of the patients receiving SBT/AMP, 31 (89%) responded to treatment and 28 patients (80%) responded to treatment with CXM. Four patients (11%) who received SBT/AMP failed to respond, as did seven patients on CXM. The bacteriological efficacy was assessed in 26 patients in the SBT/AMP group: in 22 cases (84%) baseline pathogens were eradicated, while in two patients (8%), there was persistent infection and a superinfection, respectively. In 23 patients (82%) of the CXM group (28 patients evaluated), the pathogens were eradicated, while three cases (11%) had persistent infection, and two (7%) superinfection. Apart from a case of exanthema under CXM, no adverse drug reactions were reported. No statistically significant differences were seen between the two groups. SBT/AMP proved to be a safe and effective alternative to CXM in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Identification of new members of the lytic transglycosylase family in Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli.
AB  - Although bacterial peptidoglycan metabolism and numerous of the enzymes involved  therein have been studied extensively over the years, information on the precise number of these enzymes is still lacking as is knowledge on the specific function of most of them. This observation holds true even for the well-studied bacterium Escherichia coli. Through determination of the complete sequences of bacterial genomes, that of Haemophilus influenzae being the first example, the opportunity arises to obtain a comprehensive overview of the members of the different families of peptidoglycan metabolizing enzymes by identification of their genes. Following this rationale, H. influenzae and E. coli genomic sequence was searched for new members of the family of lytic transglycosylases, using three-dimensional structure-derived sequence information. A new putative lytic transglycosylase gene could be identified in both bacterial species. The gene from E. coli was cloned and peptidoglycan hydrolase activity was demonstrated for the gene product.
TI  - Cell transfer by filtration: evaluation of protocols for transformational competence.
AB  - Collection and washing of cells by centrifugation is a time consuming and inconvenient component of many microbiological protocols, especially when sterility must be maintained. Filtration onto disposable membrane filters efficiently replaced the centrifugation steps in standard transformational competence protocols for Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. With all three protocols filtered cells were competent sooner and showed transformation efficiencies comparable to or higher than those of cells prepared by centrifugation. The procedure can be easily adapted to collect cells for many other purposes, and should be especially useful in metabolic studies and in preparing cells for electroporation, as it facilitates both thorough washing and rapid but gentle resuspension of cells without compromising sterility.

TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of meropenem against clinically isolated strains. The result against strains isolated from blood and cerebrospinal fluid].
AB  - In order to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of meropenem (MEPM), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of MEPM and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates from blood and cerebrospinal fluid that were obtained from January, 1993 to December, 1994. The results are summarized as follows; 1. The MIC-range, 50% MIC (MIC50) and 90% MIC (MIC90) of MEPM were equal to those of imipenem (IPM) and panipenem (PAPM) against Streptococcus pneumoniae including benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive or -resistant S. pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Listeria monocytogenes which are Gram-positive strains, and were stronger than those of ampicillin (ABPC) and cefotaxime (CTX). 2. The MIC-range, MIC50 and MIC90 of these 3 drugs of carbapenems (MEPM, IPM and PAPM) were different against Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae which are Gram-negative strains. The MIC90 of MEPM was < or = 0.025 microgram/ml and those of IPM and PAPM were 0.2 microgram/ml against E. coli. The MIC90 of MEPM was 0.1 microgram/ml, that of IPM was 25 micrograms/ml and that of PAPM was 6.25 micrograms/ml against H. influenzae. Thus, the antimicrobial activity of MEPM was stronger than those of IPM and PAPM. The MIC90's of IPM and PAPM against H. influenzae were high with the MIC of IPM at 12.5 approximately 25 micrograms/ml and the MIC of PAPM at 3.13 approximately 12.5 micrograms/ml against 3 IPM-resistant strains among 17 isolates. 3. The MIC90 of ABPC was 0.39 microgram/ml and that of CTX was 0.1 microgram/ml against 20 strains of S. pneumoniae including 6 strains of PCG-insensitive or resistant S. pneumoniae. The MIC90 of ABPC and CTX were higher than those of 3 carbapenem drugs. There were E. coli of 8 strains with ABPC-high resistance (the MIC of ABPC was > 100 micrograms/ml) and 2 strains for which MIC of CTX were 0.39 microgram/ml and 3.13 micrograms/ml. It was found that 29.4% of H. influenzae were beta-lactamase producing strains. 4. It appeared that antimicrobial activities of carbapenems, particularly MEPM were strong against clinical isolates from blood and cerebrospinal fluid. MEPM will be first choice drug by empiric therapy in infections including sepsis and purulent meningitis.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of a new parenteral penem, sulopenem].
AB  - Eighty percent minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC80) of sulopenem against clinically isolated 12 to 80 strains of each of different bacteria were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA): 0.20 micrograms/ml, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA): 50 micrograms/ml, coagulase-negative staphylococci: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Streptococcus pyogenes: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, Streptococcus pneumoniae: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, beta-streptococci: 0.05 microgram/ml, Enterococcus faecalis: 12.5 micrograms/ml, Enterococcus faecium: > 100 micrograms/ml, Escherichia coli CS2(R+): 0.10 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae: 0.05 microgram/ml, Proteus mirabilis: 0.10 microgram/ml, Proteus vulgaris: 0.20 microgram/ml, Morganella morganii: 0.39 micrograms/ml, Providencia rettgeri: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter freundii: 0.20 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae: 0.39 microgram/ml, Serratia marcescens: 1.56 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas cepacia: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Xanthomonas maltophilia: > 100 micrograms/ml, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus: 1.56 micrograms/ml, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae: 0.39 microgram/ml and Bacteroides fragil is: 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. Sulopenem possesses a stronger activity than flomoxef or cefuzonam against Gram-positive bacteria, the strongest activity among the antibiotics tested against Gram-negative bacteria except P. aeruginosa. Sulopenem has stronger affinities than imipenem to all fractions of PBPs of S. aureus, E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. marcescens, even of P. aeruginosa. Affinities of sulopenem to PBPs-1 and -3 of S. aureus, PBP-2 of E. coli were much stronger than those of imipenem (IPM). Sulopenem generally has small Ki values to all types of beta-lactamases and also has stronger permanent inactivation effect to Ia and IIb types of beta-lactamases than IPM. No synergistic bactericidal activity of sulopenem was apparent with serum complement. However, synergism of sulopenem with macrophages was prominent in bactericidal activity. The cells of E. coli were well phagocytosed and rapidly digested by cultured macrophages in the presence of a higher than 1/8 MIC of sulopenem. Moreover, sulopenem was more stable than imipenem against swine and human dehydropeptidase-Is. Sulopenem is one of the antibiotics that do not induce the appearance of subclones resistant to the drug.
TI  - [In vitro and in vivo activities of sulopenem compared with those of imipenem and cephalosporins].
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem (CP-70,429),a new  parenteral penem antibiotic, were compared with those of imipenem (IPM), flomoxef, cefuzonam (CZON) and cefotaxime. Sulopenem possessed broad-spectrum activities against Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria. Antibacterial activities of sulopenem against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were equivalent to or somewhat superior to those of IPM. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, sulopenem was 4- to 260-fold more active than reference antibiotics with broad-spectra. In a killing kinetics study for Haemophilus influenzae, sulopenem showed a 99.9% decrease of viable cells after 8 hours at a concentration of 0.20 micrograms/ml. This effect was obtained at a concentration 8-fold lower than that of IPM. The protective effects of sulopenem in murine experimental systemic infections were superior to those of imipenem/cilastatin. In murine experimental mixed infection with Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis, sulopenem had lower ED50, in other words stronger antimicrobial activities than IPM. The therapeutic effect of sulopenem are related well with its MIC value. In guinea pigs experimental lung infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae, sulopenem was more effective than CZON or cefotiam.
TI  - Epidemiology of bacterial meningitis in children: Aichi Prefecture, Japan, 1984-1993.
AB  - The details of 328 patients with bacterial meningitis, admitted from 1984 through 1993, were obtained from 46 departments of pediatrics of large hospitals through questionnaires. The incidence rate per 100,000 child-years was 2.32, being higher in children aged 0-4 years (rate, 7.22) than 5-15 years (rate, 0.49). The disease in the 274 (84%) etiologically diagnosed patients was due to Haemophilus influenzae (95), Streptococcus pneumoniae (56), Group B streptococci (GBS) (41), Escherichia coli (27), and other agents (55), including 7 patients with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. The short-term outcome (mean length of follow-up, 2 years, 11 months) of meningitis was death in 26 patients (8.2%) and sequelae in 49 (16.0%), including 26 children with multiple residual impairment. Tuberculous, pneumococcal, and GBS meningitis with a poor outcome increased during the late period (1989-1993) of the 10-year study. The annual infant mortality rate for purulent meningitis decreased from 3.7 to 1.4 per 100,000 population between 1984 and 1993. The incidence of a poor outcome (death and sequelae) in newborns decreased by half during the late period.
TI  - The fbpABC locus of Neisseria gonorrhoeae functions in the periplasm-to-cytosol transport of iron.
AB  - We have determined that the DNA sequence downstream of the well-characterized gonococcal fbp gene contains two open reading frames: one designated fbpB, which encodes a protein proposed to function as a cytoplasmic permease, and one designated fbpC, which encodes a protein proposed to function as a nucleotide-binding protein. The fpbABC operon composes an iron transport system that is homologous to the sfu and hit operons previously reported for Serratia marcescens and Haemophilus influenzae, respectively, and displays elements characteristic of ATP binding cassette transporters. The fpbABC operon differs from these loci in that it is lethal when overexpressed in Escherichia coli.
TI  - In-vitro interaction of azithromycin and fluoroquinolones against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the combined in-vitro effects of azithromycin plus the fluoroquinolone ofloxacin or lomefloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. METHODS: Fractional inhibitory (FIC) and fractional bactericidal concentration indices of azithromycin and the fluoroquinolone were determined using a microtiter-checkerboard method. Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, Xanthomonas maltophilia and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus were studied. Fourteen strains of S. aureus were also studied in time-kill curves with azithromycin (4 mg/L), lomefloxacin (6 mg/L) and the two in combination. RESULTS: No synergism or antagonism was found in inhibitory assays. However, bactericidal assays revealed antagonism with some strains of S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, X. maltophilia, A. calcoaceticus, P. aeruginosa, P. cepacia, K. pneumoniae and E. coli. Kill-curve results with 14 strains of S. aureus showed no antagonism with four strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and antagonism with one strain of MRSA and seven methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA). CONCLUSIONS: In-vitro exposure to combinations of azithromycin and a fluoroquinolone does not produce a synergistic effect. Antagonism was found in bactericidal assays against some gram-negative bacteria and MSSA; caution is therefore recommended in the use of macrolides and quinolones against these organisms.
TI  - Comparison of cefprozil, cefpodoxime proxetil, loracarbef, cefixime, and ceftibuten.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To discuss the pharmacokinetics, spectrum of activity, clinical trials, and adverse effects of cefprozil, cefpodoxime proxetil, loracarbef, cefixime, and ceftibuten, an investigational cephalosporin. DATA SOURCES: Literature was identified by a MEDLINE search from 1986 to January 1995. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized, controlled studies were selected for evaluation; however, uncontrolled studies were included when data were limited for indications approved by the Food and Drug Administration. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were evaluated with respect to in vitro activity, study design, clinical and microbiologic outcomes, and adverse drug reactions. DATA SYNTHESIS: Cefprozil, cefpodoxime proxetil, loracarbef, cefixime, and cefributen are active in vitro against organisms frequently involved in community-acquired infections such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, beta-lactamase-positive or -negative Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Except for cefixime and ceflibuten, they all are active against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Even though there were problems in study design (discussed within the text), clinical data demonstrate that these new oral beta-lactam compounds are as efficacious as conventional therapies for a variety of community-acquired infections. CONCLUSIONS: Cefprozil, cefpodoxime, cefixime, loracarbef, and ceftibuten demonstrate in vitro activity against the major organisms that cause community-acquired infections. Clinical trials confirm that these agents are as effective as traditional therapies for the management of acute otitis media, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, sinusitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and skin and skin-structure infections. In addition, cefixime and cefpodoxime are effective therapies for uncomplicated gonococcal infections. Selection of a specific agent will be influenced by susceptibility data and safety, as well as issues of compliance and cost.
TI  - Metabolism and evolution of Haemophilus influenzae deduced from a whole-genome comparison with Escherichia coli.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The 1.83 Megabase (Mb) sequence of the Haemophilus influenzae chromosome, the first completed genome sequence of a cellular life form, has been recently reported. Approximately 75 % of the 4.7 Mb genome sequence of Escherichia coli is also available. The life styles of the two bacteria are very different - H. influenzae is an obligate parasite that lives in human upper respiratory mucosa and can be cultivated only on rich media, whereas E. coli is a saprophyte that can grow on minimal media. A detailed comparison of the protein products encoded by these two genomes is expected to provide valuable insights into bacterial cell physiology and genome evolution. RESULTS: We describe the results of computer analysis of the amino-acid sequences of 1703 putative proteins encoded by the complete genome of H. influenzae. We detected sequence similarity to proteins in current databases for 92 % of the H. influenzae protein sequences, and at least a general functional prediction was possible for 83 %. A comparison of the H. influenzae protein sequences with those of 3010 proteins encoded by the sequenced 75 % of the E. coli genome revealed 1128 pairs of apparent orthologs, with an average of 59 % identity. In contrast to the high similarity between orthologs, the genome organization and the functional repertoire of genes in the two bacteria were remarkably different. The smaller genome size of H. influenzae is explained, to a large extent, by a reduction in the number of paralogous genes. There was no long range colinearity between the E. coli and H. influenzae gene orders, but over 70 % of the orthologous genes were found in short conserved strings, only about half of which were operons in E. coli. Superposition of the H. influenzae enzyme repertoire upon the known E. coli metabolic pathways allowed us to reconstruct similar and alternative pathways in H. influenzae and provides an explanation for the known nutritional requirements. CONCLUSIONS: By comparing proteins encoded by the two bacterial genomes, we have shown that extensive gene shuffling and variation in the extent of gene paralogy are major trends in bacterial evolution; this comparison has also allowed us to deduce crucial aspects of the largely uncharacterized metabolism of H. influenzae.
TI  - Identification of a second family of high-molecular-weight adhesion proteins expressed by non-typable Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - We previously reported that two surface-exposed high-molecular-weight proteins, HMW1 and HMW2, expressed by a prototypic strain of non-typable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI), mediate attachment to human epithelial cells. These proteins are members of a family of highly immunogenic proteins common to 70-75% of NTHI strains. NTHI strains that lack HMW1/HMW2-like proteins remain capable of efficient attachment to cultured human epithelial cells, suggesting the existence of additional adhesion molecules. We reasoned that characterization of high-molecular-weight immunogenic proteins from an HMW1/HMW2-deficient strain might identify additional adhesion proteins. A genomic library was prepared in lambda EMBL3 with chromosomal DNA from non-typable Haemophilus strain 11, a strain that lacks HMW1/HMW2-like proteins. The library was screened immunologically with convalescent serum from a child naturally infected with strain 11, and phage clones expressing high-molecular-weight recombinant proteins were identified by Western blot analysis. One clone was identified that expressed a protein with an apparent molecular mass greater than 200 kDa. Transformation of non-adherent Escherichia coli strain DH5 alpha with plasmids containing the genetic locus encoding this protein gave rise to E. coli transformants that adhered avidly to Chang conjunctival cells. Subcloning and mutagenesis studies localized the DNA conferring the adherence phenotype to a 4.8 kbp fragment, and nucleotide sequence analysis further localized the gene encoding the adhesion protein to a 3.3 kbp open reading frame predicted to encode a protein of 114 kDa. The gene was designated hia for Haemophilus influenzae adhesin. Southern analysis revealed an hia homologue in 13 of 15 HMW1/HMW2-deficient non-typable H. influenzae strains. In contrast, the hia gene was not present in any of 23 non-typable H. influenzae strains which expressed HMW1/HMW2-like proteins. Identification of this second family of high-molecular-weight adhesion proteins suggests the possibility of developing vaccines based upon a combination of HMW1/HMW2-like proteins and Hia-like proteins which would be protective against disease caused by most or all non-typable H. influenzae.
TI  - Identification of TonB homologs in the family Enterobacteriaceae and evidence for conservation of TonB-dependent energy transduction complexes.
AB  - The transport of Fe(III)-siderophore complexes and vitamin B12 across the outer membrane of Escherichia coli requires the TonB-dependent energy transduction system. A set of murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) was generated against an E. coli TrpC-TonB fusion protein to facilitate structure and function studies. In the present study, the epitopes recognized by these MAbs were mapped, and their distribution in gram-negative organisms was examined. Cross-species reactivity patterns obtained against TonB homologs of known sequence were used to refine epitope mapping, with some epitopes ultimately confirmed by inhibition experiments using synthetic polypeptides. Epitopes recognized by this set of MAbs were conserved in TonB homologs for 9 of 12 species in the family Enterobacteriaceae (including E. coli), including previously unidentified TonB homologs in Shigella, Citrobacter, Proteus, and Kluyvera species. These homologs were also detected by a polyclonal alpha-TrpC-TonB serum that additionally recognized the known Yersinia enterocolitica TonB homolog and a putative TonB homolog in Edwardsiella tarda. These antibody preparations failed to detect the known TonB homologs of either Pseudomonas putida or Haemophilus influenzae but did identify potential TonB homologs in several other nonenteric gram-negative species. In vivo chemical cross-linking experiments demonstrated that in addition to TonB, auxiliary components of the TonB-dependent energy transduction system are broadly conserved in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, suggesting that the TonB system represents a common system for high-affinity active transport across the gram-negative outer membrane.
TI  - Functional expression of uridine 5'-diphospho-glucose 4-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.2) from Arabidopsis thaliana in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli.
AB  - It is our goal to investigate the biosynthesis of galactose-containing compounds  in higher plants. Searching a database of expressed sequence tags, a cDNA from Arabidopsis thaliana (clone 108G20T7) with sequence similarity to UDP-glucose epimerase was identified and further analyzed. The 1356-bp-long cDNA included an open reading frame predicted to encode a 351 amino acid protein of 39 kDa. The presumed protein sequence showed a high degree of similarity to UDP-glucose epimerase sequences from bacteria, rat, and yeast. Complementation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gal1O mutant and expression of an active enzyme in Escherichia coli demonstrated that the cDNA encoded a functional UDP-glucose epimerase. The recombinant enzyme was purified to homogeneity. It showed a broad pH optimum of 7.0 to 9.5 and a Km of 0.11 mM. The UDP-glucose epimerase activity was not dependent on the addition of the cofactor NAD+ and was only moderately inhibited by high salt concentrations. Tissue-specific Northern analysis showed that the gene is expressed in all tissues of A. thaliana with highest expression levels in the stems and roots. Based on Southern analysis, there seems to be a single gene encoding UDP-glucose epimerase in A. thaliana. The cDNA analyzed during this study is the first known to encode a sugar-nucleotide modifying enzyme from higher plants. Its availability provides the means to investigate the role of UDP-glucose epimerase for the biosynthesis of UDP-galactose as precursor of galactolipids and cell wall polysaccharides.
TI  - Microbial genes homologous to the peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase-encoding gene of Escherichia coli.
AB  - We have cloned and determined the nucleotide (nt) sequences of the genes encoding peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase (Pth) homologues of Salmonella typhi (St) and the Lyme disease spirochaete, Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb). We also completed the nt sequence of a pth homologous gene contained in a Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) clone identified in the databanks. The open reading frames (ORFs) of the Pth homologues encode putative polypeptides of 194 (St), 188 (Bb) and 194 (Ct) amino acids exhibiting significant identity with Escherichia coli (Ec) Pth. Together with the products of two previously unidentified ORFs from Bacillus subtilis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the recently recognized Haemophilus influenzae and Mycoplasma genitalium pth genes, these seven putative polypeptides and the Ec Pth form a group of homologous basic proteins spanning eubacteria and eukaryota which can be defined by at least three conserved regions. Previously known Ec pth mutations were located in highly conserved residues.
TI  - Characterization of the Haemophilus influenzae topA locus: DNA topoisomerase I is required for genetic competence.
AB  - A gene essential for the development of genetic competence in Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) was identified as a homolog of the Escherichia coli (Ec) topA gene, which encodes DNA topoisomerase I (TopI). The Hi topA locus was initially identified by mini-Tn10kan mutagenesis. Three independent insertion events within 500 bp of each other resulted in mutant strains that shared a similar phenotype. Each was deficient in competence-induced DNA binding, showed increased sensitivity to UV irradiation, and had an increased doubling time as compared to the wild-type (wt) strain. The nucleotide sequence of a 6.6-kb fragment containing the wt allele was determined. The sequence contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 868 amino acids (aa) that was interrupted by each of the mini-Tn10kan mutations. The deduced aa sequence had a molecular mass of 98 155 Da, a pI of 8.59 and showed strong similarity to Ec TopI. Examination of the topoisomer distribution of a test plasmid in an Hi mutant carrying an insertion in this ORF showed an increase in the level of supercoiling, indicating that TopI is necessary to relax supercoiled DNA in Hi. Complementation studies and insertional inactivation of genes downstream from topA indicated that TopI and not some downstream gene product was essential for competence. Four other ORFs were identified and two of these had homology to known genes. ORF1, which was truncated at one end of the sequenced region, shared strong sequence similarity to the C-terminal end of Ec pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase beta subunit. ORF4, which was also truncated, showed strong sequence similarity to the N-terminal end of the Ec threonyl-tRNA synthetase.
TI  - Sequences of the genes encoding the A, B and C subunits of the Haemophilus influenzae dimethylsulfoxide reductase complex.
AB  - The genes (dms) encoding the dimethylsulfoxide reductase protein complex have been cloned and sequenced from Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) type b (Hib) strain Eagan. The Hib dms genes are arranged as an operon whose genomic organization is similar to that of the Escherichia coli (Ec) dmsABC operon. The deduced Hib DmsA, and DmsB and DmsC amino-acid sequences are highly homologous to their Ec counterparts and nearly identical to the recently published sequences of the Hi type-d strain Rd Dms proteins. Hi dimethylsulfoxide reductase appears to be a new member of the superfamily of oxidoreductase enzymes.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the Haemophilus influenzae transferrin receptor genes.
AB  - The genomic transferrin receptor genes (tbpA and tbpB) from two strains of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and two strains of non-typable H. influenzae (NTHi) have been cloned and sequenced. The deduced protein sequences of the H. influenzae tbpA genes were 95-100% conserved and those of the tbpB genes were 66-100% conserved. The tbpB gene from one strain of NTHi was found to encode a truncated Tbp2 protein. The tbpB genes from four additional NTHi strains were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) utilizing primers derived from the conserved N-terminal sequences of Tbp1 and Tbp2 and were found to encode full-length proteins. Although several bacterial species express transferrin receptors, when the Tbp1 and Tbp2 sequences from different organisms were compared, there was only limited homology. Recombinant Tbp1 and Tbp2 proteins were expressed from Escherichia coli and antisera were raised to the purified proteins. There was significant antigenic conservation of both Tbp1 and Tbp2 amongst H. influenzae strains, as determined by Western blot analysis. In a passive model of bacteraemia, infant rats were protected from challenge with Hib after transfer of anti-rTbp2 antiserum, but not after anti-rTbp1 antiserum.
TI  - Diffusion of 3-quaternary ammonium cephem antibiotics into cerebrospinal fluid of patients with bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Cefepime and cefpirome are new beta-lactamase resistant parenteral cephalosporin  derivatives whose spectrum of activity makes them suitable for use in the treatment of severe infections such as bacterial meningitis. However, the published information on the penetration of these new agents into human CSF and on their use in the treatment of bacterial meningitis are really scarce. Experimental studies have shown that cefepime and cefpirome penetrated remarkably well into the CSF of animals infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The mean changes in bacterial colony count in CSF after cefpirome or cefepime administration express the antibacterial activity of these drugs. Studies in patients show that cefepime and cefpirome crossed the blood-brain barrier and reached concentrations in the CSF that are bactericidal against most potential pathogens. Higher levels are likely to be achieved with multiple dosing and in the presence of inflamed meninges. No study has been performed to investigate the efficacy of cefpirome in the treatment of bacterial meningitis. Cefepime was as effective and safe as cefotaxime for treatment of patients with bacterial meningitis as shown in the only clinical trial.
TI  - Effect of number of blood cultures and volume of blood on detection of bacteremia in children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether bacteremia can be detected more rapidly and completely by (1) obtaining two blood cultures instead of one and/or (2) collecting a larger volume of blood. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective comparison of different strategies in 300 patients undergoing blood culture for suspected bacteremia. Each patient had two samples of blood, A (2 ml) and B (9.5 ml), obtained sequentially from separate sites. The B sample was divided into three aliquots: B1 (2 ml), B2 (6 ml), and ISO (1.5 ml, quantitative culture). RESULTS: A pathogen was isolated from one or more blood cultures in 30 patients (10% of cases). When measured at 24 hours, the pathogen recovery rate for the B2 sample (72%) was higher than that for the individual small-volume samples (A = 37%, B1 = 33%; p < 0.01 for each comparison) and for the combination of the two small-volume samples (A + B1 = 47%; p = 0.04). At final (7-day) reading the pathogen recovery rate for the B2 sample (83%) was higher than that for B1 (60%; p = 0.02) and similar to the recovery rate observed with the combination of the two small-volume cultures (A + B1 = 73%; p = 0.55). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the volume of blood inoculated into blood culture bottles improves the timely detection of bacteremia in pediatric patients and spares the patients the cost and pain of an additional venipuncture.
TI  - Lipoprotein e(P4) is essential for hemin uptake by Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Heme uptake is a common means of iron and porphyrin acquisition by many pathogenic bacteria. The genus Haemophilus includes several important pathogenic bacterial species that characteristically require hemin-, protoporphyrin-, or heme-substituted proteins as essential growth factors under aerobic conditions. However, the mechanism of heme transport is not understood for Haemophilus. We have cloned a DNA fragment from H. influenzae that allows an Escherichia coli hemA mutant to employ exogenous hemin or protoporphyrin IX as sole sources of porphyrin. DNA sequencing of the cloned DNA fragment suggested that a previously characterized gene (hel) encoding an antigenic, outer membrane lipoprotein e(P4) was responsible for the complementation activity. Construction of hel insertion mutations in strain H. influenzae Rd demonstrated that hel is essential for growth under aerobic conditions but not under anaerobic conditions. The aerobic growth defect of hel mutants could be reversed by providing exogenous hemin in the presence of outer membrane. The analysis of hybrids between e(P4) and beta-lactamase demonstrated that a domain of e(P4) near its NH2' terminus was required for its function in hemin use. Within this domain is a short amino acid sequence that displays similarity to H. influenzae hemin binding protein HbpA, hemin-binding motifs present in eukaryotic transcription activator heme-activated protein, and the heme containing proteins hemoglobin (alpha-chain) and cytochrome C3, suggesting that this region may be involved in hemin binding and/or transport.
TI  - Repression of the Escherichia coli modABCD (molybdate transport) operon by ModE.
AB  - The modABC gene products constitute the molybdate-specific transport system in Escherichia coli. Another operon coding for two proteins which diverges from the modABCD operon has been identified. The first gene of this operon codes for a 262-amino-acid protein, designated ModE (28 kDa), and the second genes codes for a 490-amino-acid protein. ModF (54 kDa). The role of ModF has not yet been determined; however, mutations in modE depressed modABCD transcription even in the presence of molybdate, suggesting that ModE is a repressor. ModE, in the presence of 1 mM molybdate, repressed the production of plasmid-encoded ModA and ModB' proteins in an in vitro transcription-translation system. DNA mobility shift experiments confirmed that ModE binds to an oligonucleotide derived from the operator region of the modABCD operon. Further experimentation indicated that ModE binding to target DNA minimally requires an 8-bp inverted-repeat sequence, TAAC GITA. A highly conserved amino acid sequence, TSARNOXXG (amino acids 125 to 133), was identified in ModE and homologs from Azotobacter vinelandii, Haemophilus influenzae, Rhodobacter capsulatus, and Clostridium pasterianum. Mutants with mutations in either T or G of this amino acid sequence were isolated as "superrepressor" mutants. These mutant proteins repressed modABCD transcription even in the absence of molybdate, which implies that this stretch of amino acids is essential for the binding of molybdate by the ModE protein. These results show that molybdate transport in E. coli is regulated by ModE, which acts as a repressor when bound to molybdate.
TI  - Escherichia coli tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase mutants selected for tryptophan auxotrophy implicate the dimer interface in optimizing amino acid binding.
AB  - Tryptophan auxotrophs of Escherichia coli in which mutations were mapped to the trpS locus (encoding tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase) have been previously isolated. We have investigated the tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) purified from six auxotrophic strains for changes in amino acid activation and aminoacylation. Steady-state kinetic analyses show that these mutant TrpRS proteins have increases in the apparent KM for tryptophan, decreases in turnover number, or both, without significant changes in the apparent KM for ATP or tRNA(Trp). The crystal structure of a highly homologous tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase from Bacillus stearothermophilus in a complex with the cognate aminoacyl adenylate allowed us to place the mutations in a structural context. The mutations in the enzymes are located in the KMSKS loop (M196I), in or near the active site (D112E, P129S, A133E) or far from the active site. The last three mutants (T60R, L91F, G329S) could not be predicted by examination of the protein structure as they line an interface between the C-terminal alpha-helix of one subunit and the Rossmann folds of both subunits, thus affecting a specific region of the dimer interface. These results support a role for dimerization in properly configuring the two active sites of the dimeric enzymes in the Trp/Tyr subclass of class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in order to achieve optimal catalysis.
TI  - The role of tissue colonization and bacterial resistance in recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  - Unsuccessful medical therapy for treatment of acute tonsillitis frequently results in onset of recurrent or chronic forms rendering surgical treatment necessary. We have studied some of the factors involved in the evolution of these chronic or recurrent forms and, in particular, the distribution of different bacterial strains in tonsillar tissue, their response to treatment with antibiotics and mechanisms of bacterial resistance. The distribution of bacterial flora (saprophytic and pathogenic) present on the surface of the tonsils, in the crypts and in the tonsillar tissue was studied in a control population of 30 children (20 boys and 10 girls) aged between 2-13 years, all affected with chronic tonsillitis and submitted to tonsillectomy. The same study was performed in a group of 80 sex and aged matched children, also presenting with chronic or recurrent tonsillitis and treated with amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid or cefaclor or clarithromycin 72 h before surgery. The 80 subjects were randomly divided into four groups so that each antibiotic was tested on 20 subjects. The distribution of the bacterial population on the surface of tonsillar tissue, in the crypts and in the deeper tonsillar tissue is of particular interest concerning the affinity of bacteria to the different tissue areas. In particular the interaction between crypt and tonsillar core, which could be a factor involved in the process of worsening of bacterial infection in the tonsils, is evidenced. The four antibodies tested showed different abilities to eradicate infection: Haemophilus influenzae was found to be the most resistant germ to antibiotic therapy and was thus the most frequent cause of recurrent infections. The characteristics and the mechanisms of adherence and resistance to beta lactam antibiotics were also analysed.
TI  - Identification and sequences of the Treponema pallidum mglA and mglC genes.
AB  - Treponema pallidum, the agent of syphilis, cannot be continuously cultivated in vitro. To identify treponemal genes encoding exported proteins, we performed TnphoA mutagenesis of a T. pallidum genomic DNA library in Escherichia coli. Clone 6D2 was chosen for further study based on partial nucleotide sequence obtained from p6D2 containing a TnphoA insertion. A complete open reading frame (orf1) and a truncated orf (orf2) were identified in the treponemal DNA of p6D2. Orf1 encodes a hydrophobic protein of 531 amino acids with a calculated M(r) of 57,882 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence of Orf1 has homology to the MglC proteins of E. coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Salmonella typhimurium. T. pallidum Orf1 (MglC) contains a conserved motif that is found in integral cytoplasmic membrane proteins of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport systems. T. pallidum orf2 encodes a protein of 496 amino acids with a calculated M(r) of 55,547 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence of Orf2 has homology to the MglA proteins of S. typhimurium, E. coli, H. influenzae, and Mycoplasma genitalium. Orf2 (MglA) contains two consensus ATP-binding motifs. T. pallidum mglA and mglC are located downstream of mglB, consistent with the gene order of previously identified mgl operons. The putative T. pallidum mgl operon encodes the first high-affinity ABC transport system identified in this spirochete.
TI  - Immunologic parameters in cord blood indicating early-onset sepsis.
AB  - Different immunologic parameters were measured in cord blood to test their usefulness in the early diagnosis of early onset sepsis. Cord blood levels of circulating intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (cICAM-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) were significantly elevated in septic compared to nonseptic neonates. No significant difference between either population was seen for cord blood C3a and elastase-alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor complex (E alpha 1 PI). Measured concentrations of cICAM-1, IL-6 and IL-8 in fetal and maternal blood did not correlate, indicating that the neonate's response to sepsis is clearly different from the mother. Our data suggest that cord blood measurements of cICAM-1, IL-6 and IL-8 might be useful in identifying neonates with early-onset sepsis.
TI  - A simple vectorial representation of DNA sequences for the detection of replication origins in bacteria.
AB  - A simple adaptation of Ninio's vectorial representation of DNA sequences for the  detection of replication origins in bacteria is presented. The origins of replication in Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Haemophilus influenzae and Mycoplasma genitalium are well outlined with this graphical representation.
TI  - Molecular population genetic analysis of emerged bacterial pathogens: selected insights.
AB  - Research in bacterial population genetics has increased in the last 10 years. Population genetic theory and tools and related strategies have been used to investigate bacterial pathogens that have contributed to recent episodes of temporal variation in disease frequency and severity. A common theme demonstrated by these analyses is that distinct bacterial clones are responsible for disease outbreaks and increases in infection frequency. Many of these clones are characterized by unique combinations of virulence genes or alleles of virulence genes. Because substantial interclonal variance exists in relative virulence, molecular population genetic studies have led to the concept that the unit of bacterial pathogenicity is the clone or cell line. Continued new insights into host parasite interactions at the molecular level will be achieved by combining clonal analysis of bacterial pathogens with large-scale comparative sequencing of virulence genes.
TI  - HinCyc: a knowledge base of the complete genome and metabolic pathways of H. influenzae.
AB  - We present a methodology for predicting the metabolic pathways of an organism from its genomic sequence by reference to a knowledge base of known metabolic pathways. We applied these techniques to the genome of H. influenzae by reference to the EcoCyc knowledge base to predict which of 81 metabolic pathways of E. coli are found in H. influenzae. The resulting prediction is a complex hypothesis that is presented in computer form as HinCyc: an electronic encyclopedia of the genes and metabolic pathways of H. influenzae. HinCyc connects the predicted genes, enzymes, enzyme-catalyzed reactions, and biochemical pathways in a WWW-accessible knowledge base to allow scientists to explore this complex hypothesis.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of ceftriaxone against fresh, clinically isolated strains].
AB  - In order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of ceftriaxone (CTRX), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CTRX and control drugs were determined against clinically isolated strains including those from purulent meningitis and liver and biliary tract infections in 1995. The results are summarized as follows; 1. MIC90 of CTRX was 0.05 micrograms/ml against benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae or PCG-resistant S. pneumoniae and it was < or = 0.025 micrograms/ml against beta-lactamase producing strains of Haemophilus influenzae. Antimicrobial activities of CTRX against these strains were stronger than control drugs. 2. MIC distribution of CTRX was in a lower concentration range than those of ceftazidime and flomoxef against extend broad-spectrum beta-lactamase (EBLA)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae. 3. These results suggested that CTRX will be effective against community-acquired pneumonia, purulent meningitis and liver & biliary tract infections.
TI  - Mutagenesis and ultraviolet inactivation of transforming DNA of Haemophilus influenzae complexed with a Bacillus subtilis protein that alters DNA conformation.
AB  - The wild-type Bacillus subtilis spore protein, SspCwt, binds to DNA in vitro and  in vivo and changes the conformation of DNA from B to A. Synthesis of the cloned SspCwt gene in Escherichia coli also causes large increases in mutation frequency. Binding of SspCwt to transforming DNA from Haemophilus influenzae made the DNA resistant to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The mutant protein, SspCala, which does not bind DNA, did not change the UV resistance. The UV sensitivity of the DNA/SspCwt complex was not increased when the recipients of the DNA were defective in excision of pyrimidine dimers. These data indicate that the H. influenzae excision mechanism does not operate on the spore photoproduct formed by UV irradiation of the complex. Selection for the streptomycin- or erythromycin-resistance markers on the transforming DNA evidenced significant mutations at loci closely linked to these, but not at other loci. SspCwt apparently entered the cell attached to the transforming DNA, and caused mutations in adjacent loci. The amount of such mutations decreased when the transforming DNA was UV irradiated, because UV unlinks linked markers.
TI  - Effect of malnutrition on serum and milk antibodies in Zairian women.
AB  - Serum and human milk antimicrobial antibody titers were measured longitudinally in 17 malnourished and 14 control Zairian women during 6 to 18 months of lactation to test whether malnutrition is specifically associated with an impaired secretory antibody response. No decreases in total serum and human milk immunoglobulin concentrations, neutralizing antibody titers against rotavirus, or specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay antibody titers against rotavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae were detected when malnourished women were compared with control women. Malnutrition had no effect on circulating and secretory antibody concentrations in Zairian women. Daily human milk outputs, however, were about 30% lower in malnourished than in control women, resulting in a correspondingly lower ingestion of immunoglobulins by the children of malnourished women.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: results of eight European countries.
AB  - In this multicenter study conducted in eight European countries, 13,173 pathogens--all isolated from community-acquired infections in 1992 and 1993--were evaluated for their susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin G, ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. Ten centers in Italy, five in Germany, in the Netherlands and Switzerland, four in Greece and Spain, three in Hungary and one in Finland contributed to this study; ready-to-use standardized microtiter panels (Sceptor system, BBL, Heidelberg, Germany) were used throughout all assays. The most frequently encountered species were: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and non-typhoid Salmonella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter freundii, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Moraxella catarrhalis and Shigella spp. The percentage of susceptible isolates was assessed for each of the above-mentioned countries and European-wide with all the data available. For many species, the percentage of resistant isolates did not differ markedly between the countries considered. However, one of the most striking exceptions was the high prevalence of high-level penicillin-G-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates in Hungary and Spain; some of the low-level penicillin-G-resistant strains remained susceptible to cefuroxime, whereas complete cross-resistance occurred for all other beta-lactams studied. The high frequency of ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae isolates in Spain deserves mentioning; this could be attributed mainly to the prevalence of a beta-lactamase, as the addition of clavulanic acid rendered these strains susceptible to ampicillin. The penicillin compounds exhibited the greatest activity against Gram-positive pathogens, whereas cefetamet was the most active agent against Gram-negative pathogens with a well-balanced spectrum of activity.
TI  - Cefetamet pivoxil: comparable evaluation with other orally available antibiotics  against selected species of respiratory pathogens.
AB  - Cefetamet pivoxil, the prodrug ester of cefetamet, is a new third-generation cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of activity. The in vitro activity of cefetamet was superior to that of cefaclor, ceftibuten, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, and amoxicillin alone when tested against 403 strains of freshly isolated upper and lower respiratory tract pathogens. Cefetamet killed 100% Haemophilus influenzae and H. parainfluenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains, at < or = 0.25 mg/l, Streptococcus pyogenes and S. pneumoniae at < or = 0.5 mg/l, S. agalactiae at < or = 0.1 mg/l, and streptococci at < or = 2.0 mg/l. Moreover, at < or = 4 mg/l (breaking point), cefetamet was also highly effective against Escherichia coli (94%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (92%), K. oxytoca (91%) and, at 1 mg/l, against Moraxella catarrhalis (90%), including beta-lactamase-producing strains. Furthermore, time-killing analyses at 4 x MIC demonstrated that cefetamet was bactericidal against beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, and K. pneumoniae within 6 h and S. pneumoniae within 4 h. Hydrolysis studies confirmed cefetamet's stability to TEM1 and SHV1, the most common enterobacterial beta-lactamases.
TI  - [Blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier in purulent cerebrospinal meningitis].
AB  - Our investigations concerned the blood-brain barrier (b.b.b.) in patients with acute bacterial purulent meningitis. For that purpose concentrations of proteins, which are synthesized beyond the central nervous system and in normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) exist only in slight amounts, were determined in CSF and in blood serum. Albumin was examined in the CSF of 59 patients and in the serum of 35 of them, transferrin of 40 and 32 patients, respectively. Etiological verification was obtained in 84.7% of patients. The control group consisted of 20 persons. Quantitative analytical tests were carried out by means of immunochemical, turbidimetric methods. High levels of albumin and transferrin in CSF and low in serum of patients with meningitis were observed. The obtained results, confirmed by statistical analysis, demonstrate that in the acute phase of purulent meningitis b.b.b is impaired, what leads to the transfer of the proteins from the blood serum into the cerebrospinal fluid and that transferrins a better indicator of the damage to blood-brain barrier than albumin.
TI  - Altered lipopolysaccharide characteristic of the I69 phenotype in Haemophilus influenzae results from mutations in a novel gene, isn.
AB  - The 169 phenotype of Haemophilus influenzae results from a mutation leading to a  lipopolysaccharide molecule consisting only of lipid A and a single phosphorylated 2-keto-3-deoxyoctulosonic acid residue. In this paper we describe the identification of a gene which, when mutated, results in the 169 phenotype. We have named the gene isn. The predicted amino acid sequence of Isn is homologous to the product of the lmbN gene involved in the biosynthesis of the sugar-containing antibiotic lincomycin by Streptomyces lincolnensis. lsn is situated between two loci that are homologous to the dpp and art periplasmic permease systems in Escherichia coli. Northern (RNA) blot and primer extension analyses reveal that isn is transcribed as a monocistronic mRNA. Potential functions of Isn protein are discussed.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the mammalian cytosolic branched chain aminotransferase isoenzyme.
AB  - The cDNA for the rat cytosolic branched chain aminotransferase (BCATc) has been cloned. The BCATc cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 410 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 46.0 kDa. By Northern blot analysis, BCATc message of approximately 2.7 kilobases was readily detected in rat brain, but was absent from liver, a rat hepatoma cell line, kidney, and skeletal muscle. When expressed in COS-1 cells, the enzyme is immunologically indistinguishable from the native enzyme found in rat brain cytosol. Comparison of the rat BCATc sequence with available data bases identified the Escherichia coli (and Salmonella typhimurium) branched chain aminotransferase (BCAT) and revealed a Haemophilus influenzae BCAT, a yeast BCAT, which is hypothesized to be a mitochondrial form of the enzyme, and the murine BCATc (protein ECA39). Calculated molecular masses for the complete proteins are 33.9 kDa, 37.9 kDa, 42.9 kDa, and 43.6 kDa, respectively. The rat BCATc sequence was 84% identical with murine BCATc, 45% identical with yeast, 33% identical with H. influenzae, 27% identical with the E. coli and S. typhimurium BCAT, and 22% identical with the evolutionary related D-amino acid aminotransferase (D-AAT) (Tanizawa, K., Asano, S., Masu, Y., Kuramitsu, S., Kagamiyama, H., Tanaka, H., and Soda, K. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 2450-2454). Amino acid sequence alignment of BCATc with D-AAT suggests that the folding pattern of the overlapping mammalian BCATc sequence is similar to that of D-AAT and indicates that orientation of the pyridoxal phosphate cofactor in the active site of the eukaryotic BCAT is the same as in D-AAT. Thus, BCAT are the only eukaryotic aminotransferases to abstract and replace the proton on the re face of the pyridoxal phosphate cofactor. Finally, requirements for recognition of substrate L-amino acid and alpha-carboxylate binding are discussed.
TI  - The product of the pilQ gene is essential for the biogenesis of type IV pili in Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  - The product of the Neisseria gonorrhoeae omc gene possesses regions homologous to those found in members of a protein superfamily that are associated with the translocation of proteins and DNA-protein complexes across the outer membrane. Amongst its protein homologues, Omc has higher overall homology to PilQ, which is required for type IV pilus expression in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and OrfE, which is required for sequence-specific DNA uptake by Haemophilus influenzae. The function of Omc, however, is unknown and gonococcal omc mutants have not been described. We constructed gonococcal mutants expressing truncated forms of the protein, and found that these mutants are severely defective for both pilus expression and competence for natural transformation. To be consistent with pre-existing pilus gene nomenclature, we have redesignated the gene pilQ instead of omc, and its product, PilQ instead of Omc. The MS11 gene was sequenced and found to differ from the DNA sequence reported for that of another gonococcal strain; these differences were associated with a repeated DNA element, suggesting a genetic basis for structural variation in PilQ. The results also show that PilQ- mutants are distinct from previously described gonococcal pilus-assembly mutants and P. aeruginosa PilQ- mutants by virtue of their expression of rare pilus filaments. Taking these data into account, PilQ is proposed to function in the terminal steps of organelle biogenesis by acting as a pilus channel or pore.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of clavulanic acid/amoxicillin against freshly isolated clinical strains from outpatients].
AB  - In order to investigate antimicrobial activities of clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (CVA/AMPC) against freshly isolated clinical strains obtained in 1995, beta-lactamase activities and minimum inhibitory concentration (MICs) were determined including those of the control drugs. The results are summarized as follows; 1. Detection frequencies of beta-lactamase producing strains were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus (MSSA, 90.0%), Haemophilus influenzae (22.0%), Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis (100.0%), Escherichia coli (100.0%), Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae (100.0%) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (14.0%). It appeared that beta-lactamases produced by these strains were mostly penicillinase or enzyme of similar that. 2. Antimicrobial activities of CVA/AMPC against beta-lactamase producing strains were stronger than those of AMPC, and MIC90 of CVA/AMPC against benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive or resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae was lower than those of sultamicillin, cefaclor and cefpodoxime. 3. CVA showed strong beta-lactamase inhibitory effect against M.(B.) catarrhalis of direct and indirect pathogenicity. We can expect CVA/AMPC to negate or decrease the influence of indirect pathogenicity.
TI  - Quality assessment of Microbe Base antimicrobial susceptibility data.
AB  - AIMS: To assess the quality of centres contributing antimicrobial susceptibility  data to a centralised database. METHODS: Twelve organisms were distributed to 31 regional microbiology laboratories contributing data to a centralised susceptibility database. Participants were asked to determine susceptibilities to certain antibiotics by their routine method and return the data to the Department of Microbiology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, for analysis. RESULTS: Results for the overwhelming majority of organism/antibiotic combinations were in agreement with expected results. Reasons for discrepancies included the non-bimodal distribution of susceptibilities, the use of different content discs, and, more importantly, minimum inhibitory concentrations falling close to breakpoint values. CONCLUSIONS: It is inevitable that any large multicentre database will contain a degree of inaccurate data. This study has highlighted several areas where discrepant results have occurred and has enabled Glaxo Laboratories to approach individual laboratories to address this problem. This study emphasises the value and consistency of Microbe Base as the largest database, of its kind, nationally.
TI  - Characterization of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae riboflavin biosynthesis genes.
AB  - In this paper, we report the identification, cloning, and complete nucleotide sequence of four genes from Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae that are involved in riboflavin biosynthesis. The cloned genes can specify production of large amounts of riboflavin in Escherichia coli, can complement several defined genetic mutations in riboflavin biosynthesis in E. coli, and are homologous to riboflavin biosynthetic genes from E. coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacillus subtilis. The genes have been designated A. pleuropneumoniae ribGBAH because of their similarity in both sequence and arrangement to the B. subtilis ribGBAH operon.
TI  - Structure-function relationship of bacterial prolipoprotein diacylglyceryl transferase: functionally significant conserved regions.
AB  - The structure-function relationship of bacterial prolipoprotein diacylgyceryl transferase (LGT) Has been investigated by a comparison of the primary structures of this enzyme in phylogenetically distant bacterial species, analysis of the sequences of mutant enzymes, and specific chemical modification of the Escherichia coli enzyme. A clone containing the gene for LGT, lgt, of the gram-positive species Staphylococcus aureus was isolated by complementation of the temperature-sensitive lgt mutant of E. coli (strain SK634) defective in LGT activity. In vivo and in vitro assays for prolipoprotein diacylglyceryl modification activity indicated that the complementing clone restored the prolipoprotein modification activity in the mutant strain. Sequence determination of the insert DNA revealed an open reading frame of 837 bp encoding a protein of 279 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 31.6 kDa. S. aureus LGT showed 24% identity and 47% similarity with E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Haemophilus influenzae LGT.S. aureus LGT, while 12 amino acids shorter than the E. coli enzyme, had a hydropathic profile and a predicted pI (10.4) similar to those of the E. coli enzyme. Multiple sequence alignment among E. coli, S. typhimurium, H. influenzae, and S. aureus LGT proteins revealed regions of highly conserved amino acid sequences throughout the molecule. Three independent lgt mutant alleles from E. coli SK634, SK635, and SK636 and one lgt allele from S. typhimurium SE5221, all defective in LGT activity at the nonpermissive temperature, were cloned by PCR and sequenced. The mutant alleles were found to contain a single base alteration resulting in the substitution of a conserved amino acid. The longest set of identical amino acids without any gap was H-103-GGLIG-108 in LGT from these four microorganisms. In E. coli lgt mutant SK634, Gly-104 in this region was mutated to Ser, and the mutant organism was temperature sensitive in growth and exhibited low LGT activity in vitro. Diethylpyrocarbonate inactivated the E. coli LGT with a second-order rate constant of 18.6 M-1S-1, and the inactivation of LGT activity was reversed by hydroxylamine at pH 7. The inactivation kinetics were consistent with the modification of a single residue, His or Tyr, essential for LGT activity.
TI  - Expression and characterization of the ponA (ORF I) gene of Haemophilus influenzae: functional complementation in a heterologous system.
AB  - The coding sequence of the Haemophilus influenzae ORF I gene was amplified by PCR and cloned into different Escherichia coli expression vectors. The ORF I-encoded protein was approximately 90 kDa and bound 3H-benzyl-penicillin and 125I-cephradine. This high-molecular-weight penicillin-binding protein (PBP) was also shown to possess transglycosylase activity, indicating that the ORF I product is a bifunctional PBP. The ORF I protein was capable of maintaining the viability of E. coli delta ponA ponB::spcr cells in transcomplementation experiments, establishing the functional relevance of the significant amino acid homology seen between E. coli PBP 1A and 1B and the H. influenzae ORF I product. In addition, the physiological functioning of the H. influenzae ORF I (PBP 1A) product in a heterologous species established the ability of the enzyme not only to recognize the E. coli substrate but also to interact with heterologous cell division proteins. The affinity of the ORF I product for 3H-benzylpenicillin and 125I-cephradine, the MIC of beta-lactams for E. coli delta ponA ponB::spcr expressing the ORF I gene, and the amino acid alignment of the PBP 1 family of high-molecular-weight PBPs group the ORF I protein into the PBP 1A family of high-molecular-weight PBPs.
TI  - Contribution of the major and minor subunits to fimbria-mediated adherence of Haemophilus influenzae to human epithelial cells and erythrocytes.
AB  - Fimbriae are colonization factors of the human pathogen Haemophilus influenzae in that they mediate bacterial adherence to human eukaryotic cells. The contribution of the major (HifA) and putative minor (HifD and HifE) subunits of H. influenzae fimbriae to fimbria-specific adherence was studied by using mutants that were inactivated in distinct fimbrial genes. Both the major and minor subunits were required for adherence of H. influenzae to oropharyngeal epithelial cells and human erythrocytes carrying the AnWj antigen. Cloning of defined H. influenzae fimbrial genes in an Escherichia coli strain with type 1 fimbriae yielded recombinants expressing high amounts of HifA-containing H. influenzae fimbriae either with or without coexpression of both H. influenzae minor subunits. Both clones exhibited the specific adherence properties of H. influenzae fimbriae, implying that the minor H. influenzae subunits are dispensable for adherence and that the adhesive domain resides in the major subunit, HifA. In H. influenzae itself, the minor subunits probably affect adherence by raising the number of fimbriae above the minimal level required to establish adherence.
TI  - Mutation of the htrB locus of Haemophilus influenzae nontypable strain 2019 is associated with modifications of lipid A and phosphorylation of the lipo-oligosaccharide.
AB  - The HtrB protein was first identified in Escherichia coli as a protein required for cell viability at high temperature, but its expression was not regulated by temperature. We isolated an htrB homologue from non-typable Haemophilus influenzae strain (NTHi) 2019, which was able to functionally complement the E. coli htrB mutation. The promoter for the NTHi 2019 htrB gene overlaps the promoter for the rfaE gene, and the two genes are divergently transcribed. The deduced amino acid sequence of NTHi 2019 HtrB had 56% homology to E. coli HtrB. In vitro transcription-translation analysis confirmed production of a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 32-33 kDa. Primer extension analysis revealed that htrB was transcribed from a sigma 70-dependent consensus promoter and its expression was not affected by temperature. The expression of htrB and rfaE was 2.5-4 times higher in the NTHi htrB mutant B29 than in the parental strain. In order to study the function of the HtrB protein in Haemophilus, we generated two isogenic htrB mutants by shuttle mutagenesis using a mini-Tn3. The htrB mutants initially showed temperature sensitivity, but they lost the sensitivity after a few passages at 30 degrees C and were able to grow at 37 degrees C. They also showed hypersensitivity to deoxycholate and kanamycin, which persisted on passage. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that the lipo-oligosaccharide (LOS) isolated from these mutants migrated faster than the wild type LOS and its color changed from black to brown as has been described for E. coli htrB mutants. Immunoblotting analysis also showed that the LOS from the htrB mutants lost reactivity to a monoclonal antibody, 6E4, which binds to the wild type NTHi 2019 LOS. Electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry analysis of the O-deacylated LOS oligosaccharide indicated a modification of the core structure characterized in part by a net loss in phosphoethanolamine. Mass spectrometric analysis of the lipid A of the htrB mutant indicated a loss of one or both myristic acid substitutions. These data suggest that HtrB is a multifunctional protein and may play a controlling role in regulating cell responses to various environmental changes.
TI  - Community acquired, nursing home acquired and hospital acquired pneumonia: A five-year review of the clinical, bacteriological and radiological characteristics.
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the contemporary clinical, bacteriological and radiographic features of hospitalized patients with community acquired (ca), nursing home acquired (na) and hospital acquired pneumonia (ha) and to examine patient outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All hospital records of patients with pneumonia over a five-year period from April 1987 to March 1992 were reviewed retrospectively. Patients included in the study were all those with a diagnosis of pneumonia as identified by computer records of diagnostic codes at discharge; patients with a specific diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia were excluded. Of 74,435 discharges over the five-year period, 1782 patients met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Charts of 1622 of the total 1782 cases were reviewed. Mean age was 64.4 years with 59.4% men and 40.6% women. Sixty-three per cent were ca, 28.5% were ha and 8.5% were na. A total of 1542 patients (95%) had at least one concomitant medical condition. Chest roentgenogram was abnormal in 97%. Common organisms isolated overall were Haemophilus influenzae (from 204 patients), Staphylococcus aureas (from 152 patients), Streptococcus pneumoniae (from 143 patients ), Escherichia coli (from 113 patients) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (from 111 patients). H influenzae and S pneumoniae were most common in ca pneumonia, whereas S aureus and Gram-negative organisms were more common in the ha group and Gram-negative agents in the na group. One hundred and four patients developed complications. Fifteen per cent required intensive care unit admission. The average length of hospitalization in the ca and na groups was 17 days and in the ha group, 43 days. At time of discharge 1261 patients (78%) were cured or improved, and 361 patients (22%) died during the admission. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that hospitalization for pneumonia in the 1990s is primarily for elderly patients with significant co-morbidity. Although microbiology appears unchanged compared with earlier reports, the contemporary population is significantly sicker than previous cohorts. This may account for the persistently high morbidity and mortality despite better or newer antibiotics.
TI  - Regulation of the Escherichia coli S10 ribosomal protein operon by heterologous L4 ribosomal proteins.
AB  - We have cloned the L4 ribosomal protein genes from Morganella morganii and Haemophilus influenza. The sequences of these genes were compared with published sequences for Escherichia coli, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Bacillus stearothermophilus. All five of these L4 genes were expressed in E. coli and shown to function as repressors of both transcription and translation of the E. coli S10 operon. Possible implications for regulation of r-protein synthesis in species other E. coli are discussed.
TI  - [Pathogenic bacteria isolated from the sputum of the patients with pulmonary emphysema].
AB  - Isolated pathogenic bacteria from sputum of the patients with pulmonary emphysema who were admitted in our hospital from 1984 to 1994 were examined to elucidate the relationship between isolated bacteria from sputum and pulmonary functions including vital capacity (VC), forced expiratory volume (FEV1.0), PaO2 and PaCO2. VC of the patients from whom MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) or Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) were isolated was significantly lower than that of the patients from whom Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), Branhamella catarrhalis (B. catarrhalis) or Haemophilus influenza (H. influenza) were isolated. FEV1.0 had a similar tendency as VC in terms of isolated organisms from the patients with emphysema. Similarly, PO2 of the patients from whom MSSA or E. cloacae were isolated was significantly lower than that of the patients from whom S. pneumoniae, B. catarrhalis or H. influenzae were isolated, and PCO2 of the patients from whom S. pneumoniae, B. catarrhalis or H. influenza were isolated. There was also impaired respiratory function in the patients from whom MSSA, Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Xanthomonas maltophilia (X. maltophilia) or Enterobacter cloacae (E. cloacae) were isolated, compared with those in the patients from whom S. pneumonia, B. catarrhalis or H. influenzae were isolated. These results suggest that isolated pathogenic bacteria are shifted from S. pneumoniae, B. catarrhalis or H. influenza to MSSA, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, X. maltophilia or E. cloacae in the course of impairment of respiratory function in pulmonary emphysema. The treatment and prophylaxis for acute exacerbation in pulmonary emphysema should be based on these results.
TI  - Two cases of infected atherosclerotic aneurysms and a comparison with infective endocarditis.
AB  - Two cases of infected atherosclerotic aneurysms thought to have arisen following  haematogenous seeding of atheromatous lesions are described. Although infective endocarditis also arises by the haematogenous route, there are striking contrasts in both the range and therefore likely source of organisms, together with a perceived difference in the rate of blood-culture positivity. This case report provides a focus for discussion of these observations.
TI  - Resistance to ceftriaxone and other beta-lactams in bacteria isolated in the community. The Vigil'Roc Study Group.
AB  - The incidence of bacterial species and their susceptibilities to ceftriaxone and  other beta-lactams from patients with community-acquired infections were evaluated in a multicenter study over a 4-month period. A total of 5,768 bacterial isolates were classified according to whether the patient had been previously hospitalized or had received antibiotic treatment. The most relevant findings were the presence of 33.8% penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 25% beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae isolates, and 36.4% amoxicillin-resistant Escherichia coli isolates. All of these bacteria were fully susceptible to ceftriaxone. Nosocomial multiply-resistant bacteria, and particularly methicillin-resistant S. aureus, were found, as expected, at a higher frequency among previously hospitalized patients. However, such bacteria may be present in the community; their incidence is high in particular clinical settings, and such bacteria should be considered when one is choosing a first-line therapy for the treatment of severe infections.
TI  - Identification and characterization of an immunogenic outer membrane protein of Campylobacter jejuni.
AB  - We cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli a gene encoding an 18-kDa outer membrane protein (Omp18) from Campylobacter jejuni ATCC 29428. The nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding Omp18 was determined, and an open reading frame of 165 amino acids was revealed. The amino acid sequence had the typical features of a leader sequence and a signal peptidase II cleavage site at the N-terminal part of Omp18. Moreover, the sequence had a high degree of similarity to the peptidoglycan-associated outer membrane lipoprotein P6 of Haemophilus influenzae and the peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein PAL of E. coli. Southern blot analysis in which the cloned gene was used as a probe revealed genes similar to that encoding Omp18 in all species of the thermophilic group of campylobacters as well as Campylobacter sputorum. All campylobacters tested expressed a protein with a molecular mass identical to that of Omp18. The protein reacted immunologically with polyclonal antibodies directed against Omp18 from C. jejuni. PCR amplification of the gene encoding Omp18 with specific primers and subsequent restriction enzyme analysis of the amplified DNA fragments showed that the gene for Omp18 is highly conserved in C. jejuni strains isolated from humans, dogs, cats, calves, and chickens but is different in other Campylobacter species. In order to obtain pure recombinant Omp18 protein for serological assays, the cloned gene for Omp18 was genetically modified by replacing the signal sequence with a DNA segment encoding six adjacent histidine residues. Expression of this construct in E. coli allowed purification of the modified protein (Omp18-6xHis) by metal chelation chromatography. Sera from patients with past C. jejuni infection reacted positively with Omp18-6xHis, while sera from healthy blood donors showed no reaction with this antigen. Omp18, which is an outer membrane protein belonging to the family of PALs is well conserved in C. jejuni and is highly immunogenic. It is therefore a good candidate as an antigen for the serological diagnosis of past C. jejuni infections.
TI  - Modeling of the structure of the Haemophilus influenzae heme-binding protein suggests a mode of heme interaction.
AB  - The structure and function of the periplasmic heme-binding protein HbpA of Haemophilus influenzae were investigated. This protein is involved in the import of heme into the bacteria through the inner membrane, and thus is a key element of the organism's ability to survive in blood. A high degree of sequence similarity between HbpA and the dipeptide-binding protein of Escherichia coli is suggested to be the result of a functional relationship. An HbpA model built using the dipeptide-binding protein suggests a mode of heme binding that is distinct from those known in proteins of the human host. These results provide a starting point for rational drug design.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of cefprozil in vitro.
AB  - Cefprozil is a new orally active cephalosporin which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. Using the standard agar dilution method we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other oral cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin against 637 recent clinical isolates from the Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan. Against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, cefprozil showed good activity, inhibiting over 80% of these isolates at 8 mg/l. Like other oral drugs of its class, it had little activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. Against Haemophilus influenzae, irrespective of beta-lactamase production, its activity was similar to comparable drugs. Against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, cefprozil showed high activity, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 4 mg/l, whereas against methicillin-resistant S. aureus, its activity was higher than that of other oral cephalosporins tested and was similar to that of ciprofloxacin. Of enterococci tested, 57.7% were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefprozil. Against beta-hemolytic streptococci, its activity was superior to all other drugs tested. The results of this in vitro study indicate that oral administration of cefprozil might be efficacious in the treatment of community-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.
TI  - The OmpU outer membrane protein, a potential adherence factor of Vibrio cholerae.
AB  - Expression of the OmpU outer membrane protein of Vibrio cholerae is positively regulated by toxR, which also regulates critical virulence factors such as cholera toxin and the toxin-coregulated pilus colonization factor. In this study, we have characterized the 38-kDa OmpU protein and investigated its role in the adhesion of V. cholerae to mammalian cells. The amino-terminal sequence of OmpU has similarity with the sequences of Haemophilus influenzae HMW1 and HMW2 adhesins, which, in turn, also have similarity with the sequence of Bordetella pertussis filamentous hemagglutinin. A monoclonal antibody directed against FHA recognized both V. cholerae OmpU and Escherichia coli OmpA, and polyclonal anti-OmpU antibodies recognized FHA and E. coli OmpA, suggesting the existence of common epitopes among these proteins. OmpU was strongly recognized by convalescent-phase serum from volunteers experimentally infected with virulent V. cholerae strains, indicating that OmpU is immunogenic and produced in vivo. OmpU selectively bound to fibronectin and to an arginine-glycine-asparagine (RGD) tripeptide but not to other matrix glycoproteins tested such as collagen or laminin. Antibodies directed against OmpU or their F(ab)2 fragments completely inhibited adhesion of several V. cholerae strains to HeLa, HEp-2, Caco-2, and Henle 407 epithelial cells and also inhibited intestinal colonization and conferred protection in newborn mice against both biotypes (El Tor and classical) of V. cholerae O1. Collectively, these data indicate that OmpU has adhesive properties which may play a role in the pathogenesis of cholera.
TI  - Mapping of a surface-exposed, conformational epitope of the P6 protein of Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - P6 is an outer membrane protein of Haemophilus influenzae that is antigenically conserved and considered a candidate component of future H. influenzae vaccines. P6 contains a surface-exposed epitope recognized by monoclonal antibody (MAb) 3B9. This epitope has been shown to be distinct from that recognized by the P6-specific MAbs 7F3 and 4G4 in a competitive inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). MAb 3B9 did not bind to synthetic P6-specific sequential and overlapping hexameric peptides. Five peptides made to correspond to P6 sequences with high probabilities of surface exposure did not inhibit binding of MAb 3B9 to P6. An antiserum to one of the peptides, designated SP66, inhibited binding of MAb 3B9 to P6. A rabbit antiserum to P6 bound to sequential hexameric peptides, Gly-87AsnThrAspGluArgGlyThr-94, which were in the SP66 region of P6. This antiserum inhibited the binding of P6 to MAb 3B9 in a competitive inhibition ELISA. P6 mutations with His and Ala substitutions at residues Thr-88 and Asn-89 still bound MAb 3B9. MAb 3B9 reacted with Escherichia coli OmpA and Salmonella typhimurium OmpA. Sequence comparisons of P6 with these proteins indicated that the residue in the SP66 region responsible for binding is either Gly-87, Asp-90, or Gly-93. Mercaptoethanol reduction abolished MAb 3B9 binding to E. coli OmpA and S. typhimurium OmpA. In these proteins, immediately downstream of the second cysteine, there is an ArgArg dipeptide which is identical to and aligns with Arg-147Arg-148 in P6. This dipeptide has a high probability of surface exposure in P6. Mutagenesis of the Arg-147Arg-148 to an AlaAla dipeptide in P6 abolished binding of MAb 3B9, demonstrating that it was either a portion of the epitope or important in the protein folding necessary for expression of this epitope. This study demonstrates that MAb 3B9 recognizes a conserved conformational determinant on the surface of H. influenzae that is composed of two discontinuous regions of P6.
TI  - Biochemical characterization of a Haemophilus influenzae periplasmic iron transport operon.
AB  - Bacterial iron transport is critical for growth of pathogens in the host environment, where iron is limited as a form of nonspecific immunity. For Gram-negative bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae, iron first must be transported across the outer membrane and into the periplasmic space, then from the periplasm to the cytosol. H. influenzae express a periplasmic iron-binding protein encoded by the hitA gene. This gene is organized as the first of a three-gene operon purported to encode a classic high affinity iron acquisition system that includes hitA, a cytoplasmic permease (hitB), and a nucleotide binding protein (hitC). In this study we describe the cloning, overexpression, and purification of the H. influenzae hitA gene product. The function of this protein is unambiguously assigned by demonstrating its ability to compete for iron bound to the chemical iron chelator 2,2'-dipyridyl, both in vitro and within the periplasmic space of a siderophore-deficient strain of Escherichia coli. Finally, the importance of a functional hitABC operon for iron acquisition is demonstrated by complementation of this siderophore-deficient E. coli to growth on dipyridyl-containing medium. These studies represent a detailed genetic, biochemical, and physiologic description of an active transport system that has evolved to efficiently transport iron and consequently is widely distributed among Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Sequence, genetic analysis, and expression of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae transferrin receptor genes.
AB  - The tbpA and tbpB genes encoding the transferrin receptor proteins Tbp1 and Tbp2  from a serotype 7 strain of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae were cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli. The tbpB gene was preceded by putative promoter and regulatory sequences and was separated from the downstream tbpA gene by a 13 bp intercistronic sequence suggesting that the two genes may be coordinately transcribed. Determination of the nucleotide sequence of this region facilitated PCR amplification of the tbp region from a serotype 1 strain for comparative purposes. The deduced amino acid sequences of the Tbp1 proteins had regions of homology with Neisseria Lbp and Tbp1s and with TonB-dependent outer membrane (OM) receptors of E. coli. The deduced amino acid sequences of the Tbp2 proteins were nearly identical to those presented in previous studies. Upon high-level expression of the tbpA gene, a large proportion of the recombinant Tbp1 was found in inclusion bodies and could not be affinity-isolated with immobilized porcine transferrin. Most of the remaining expressed Tbp1 was present in the OM fraction, was expressed at the surface of E. coli cells, and retained binding activity that was specific for the C-lobe of porcine transferrin. Although recombinant Tbp2 was found in inclusion bodies during high-level expression, a significant proportion was associated with a novel OM fraction that appeared in sucrose density gradients which was distinct from the OM fraction containing recombinant Tbp1. The recombinant Tbp2 was accessible at the surface yet was unable to bind porcine transferrin. In contrast to previous observations, the binding by recombinant Tbp2 was specific for the C-lobe of porcine transferrin. These results indicate that the A. pleuropneumoniae transferrin receptor proteins have similar properties to the receptor proteins in Neisseria spp. and Haemophilus influenzae, and that functional studies performed with recombinant receptor proteins need to consider differences in processing and export of these proteins when expressed in heterologous hosts.
TI  - Potential role of nitric oxide in the pathophysiology of experimental bacterial meningitis in rats.
AB  - We have investigated the possible role of nitric oxide (NO) in the pathophysiology of bacterial meningitis (BM) by using the rat model of experimental BM. The nitrite concentration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was used as a measure of NO production in vivo since NO rapidly degrades to nitrite and nitrate. Rats were inoculated intracisternally with live bacteria (5 x 10(6) CFU of Haemophilus influenzae type b strain DL42 or Rd-/b+/O2), with bacterial endotoxin (20 ng of DL42 lipooligosaccharide [LOS] or 200 ng of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide), or with a saline control vehicle. CSF samples were collected preinoculation and at the time of maximal alteration in blood-brain barrier permeability (BBBP). CSF [nitrite] was quantified by measuring A550 after addition of the Greiss reagent and comparison to a standard curve of sodium nitrite. Rats inoculated with either DL42, Rd-/b+/O2, LOS, or lipopolysaccharide demonstrated a significantly elevated mean peak CSF [nitrite] (8.34, 15.62, 10.75, and 10.44 mM, respectively) versus the concentration prior to treatment and/or those in saline-treated animals (5.29 and 5.33 mM, respectively; P < 0.05 for each comparison). We then determined if there was a correlation between CSF [nitrite] and percent BBBP (%BBBP) at various time points postinoculation with Rd-/b+/O2. %BBBP was defined as the concentration of systemically administered 125I-labeled bovine serum albumin in the CSF divided by the level of 125I-labeled bovine serum albumin in serum multiplied by 100. The mean %BBBP increased in tandem with the mean CSF [nitrite] (R = 0.84, P = 0.018), which peaked at 18 h in the absence of a change in the serum [nitrite]. Systemic administration of the NO synthase inhibitor N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester demonstrated a significant reduction of mean CSF nitrite production (0.95 versus 6.0 mM in controls; P = 0.02) when administered intravenously to animals which had been inoculated intracisternally with 20 ng of LOS. Suppression of mean leukocyte pleocytosis (3,117 versus 11,590 leukocytes per mm3 in control LOS-challenged rats; P = 0.03) and mean alterations of BBBP (2.11 versus 6.49% in control LOS-challenged rats; P = 0.009) was observed concomitantly with decreased CSF [nitrite]. These results support the hypothesis that NO contributes to increased %BBBP in experimental BM.
TI  - Clinical utility of blood cultures in adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia without defined underlying risks.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: We retrospectively examined the clinical utility of obtaining routine blood cultures before the administration of antibiotics in certain nonimmunosuppressed patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) admitted to the hospital during 1991. DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Grady Memorial Hospital (a county hospital primarily serving inner-city Atlanta). PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Hospital discharge diagnosis listings identified 1,250 adults ( > or = 18 years old) with pneumonia. From this group of patients, we selected patients admitted to the hospital with (1) respiratory symptoms and a lobar infiltrate on chest radiograph that were present at the time of hospital admission, (2) two or more sets of blood cultures obtained within 48 h of hospital admission, and (3) absence of defined risk factors: HIV-related illness, malignancy, recent chemotherapy, steroid therapy, sickle cell disease, nursing home residence, or hospital stays within the past 14 days. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Five hundred seventeen patients (mean age, 52 years;: age range, 18 to 103 years) qualified. Of these 517 patients, 25 patients (4.8%) had growth in blood cultures considered contaminants while 34 (6.6%) had blood cultures positive for the following pathogens: 29 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 3 Haemophilus influenzae, and 1 Streptococcus pyogenes, 1 Escherichia coli. Antibiotic therapy was changed for 7 of the 34 patients with positive blood cultures (1.4% of study patients). Antibiotic regimens were altered in 48 additional patients based on sputum culture, poor clinical response, and allergic reactions. CONCLUSIONS: Few blood cultures were positive for likely infecting organisms in adult patients with CAP without defined underlying risk factors. Furthermore, a total of $34,122 was spent on blood cultures at $66 per patient. In this carefully defined group of patients, blood cultures may have limited clinical utility and questionable cost-effectiveness.
TI  - The cochlear lesion in experimental bacterial meningitis of the rabbit.
AB  - Sensorineural hearing loss was studied in a rabbit model of experimental bacterial meningitis using electrophysiological and ultrastructural techniques. Hearing impairment was monitored by auditory brain-stem evoked responses (ABERs) and concomitant structural lesions were identified by both transmission (TEM) and scanning (SEM) electron microscopy. Meningitis was induced by intra-cerebrospinal fluid injection of either Escherichia coli (strain 2073 and type K-12) or Haemophilus influenzae type b. Auditory loss of approximately equal to 10 dB occurred in all rabbits by about 10 hours post infection and progressed in severity until by 20 h following infection, hearing losses up to and > 60 dB were obtained. At levels of hearing loss < 20 dB ultrastructural damage to the organ of Corti was barely detectable. With greater levels of hearing loss, patchy structural damage to hair cells, synaptic nerve terminals, supporting cells and inner spiral sulcus cells and cells of the stria vascularis was clearly evident. Bacteria were found in scala tympani, the basilar membrane, the organ of Corti, scala media, the spiral ligament and at the margin of the stria vascularis. Evidence of bleeding was found in some cochleas; erythrocytes were found in scala tympani, scala media, amongst hair cells and beneath the tectorial membrane. The results show that hearing loss is associated with bacterial invasion and damage to the organ of Corti and that the cause of hearing loss is likely to result from multiple lesions within the cochlea. Lesions to sensory cells almost certainly will produce permanent hearing loss. Lesions to supporting cells, nerve terminals and to stria vascularis may well produce only temporary hearing loss.
TI  - Genome sequencing projects.
AB  
TI  - The outer membranes of Brucella spp. are resistant to bactericidal cationic peptides.
AB  - The actions of polymyxin B, rabbit polymorphonuclear lysosome extracts, 14 polycationic peptides (including defensin NP-2, cecropin P1, lactoferricin B, and active peptides from cationic protein 18 and bactenecin), EDTA, and Tris on Brucella spp. were studied, with other gram-negative bacteria as controls. Brucella spp. were comparatively resistant to all of the agents listed above and bound less polymyxin B, and their outer membranes (OMs) were neither morphologically altered nor permeabilized to lysozyme by polymyxin B concentrations, although both effects were observed for controls. EDTA and peptides increased or accelerated the partition of the hydrophobic probe N-phenyl-naphthylamine into Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae OMs but had no effect on Brucella OMs. Since Brucella and H. influenzae OMs are permeable to hydrophobic compounds (G. Martinez de Tejada and I. Moriyon, J. Bacteriol. 175:5273-5275, 1993), the results show that such unusual permeability is not necessarily related to resistance to polycations. Although rough (R) B. abortus and B. ovis were more resistant than the controls were, there were qualitative and quantitative differences with smooth (S) brucellae; this may explain known host range and virulence differences. Brucella S-lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) had reduced affinities for polycations, and insertion of Brucella and Salmonella montevideo S-LPSs into the OM of a Brucella R-LPS mutant increased and decreased, respectively, its resistance to cationic peptides. The results show that the core lipid A of Brucella LPS plays a major role in polycation resistance and that O-chain density also contributes significantly. It is proposed that the features described above contribute to Brucella resistance to the oxygen-independent systems of phagocytes.
TI  - Frequency and distribution of DNA uptake signal sequences in the Haemophilus influenzae Rd genome.
AB  - The naturally transformable, Gram-negative bacterium Haemophilus influenzae Rd preferentially takes up DNA of its own species by recognizing a 9-base pair sequence, 5'-AAGTGCGGT, carried in multiple copies in its chromosome. With the availability of the complete genome sequence, 1465 copies of the 9-base pair uptake site have been identified. Alignment of these sites unexpectedly reveals an extended consensus region of 29 base pairs containing the core 9-base pair region and two downstream 6-base pair A/T-rich regions, each spaced about one helix turn apart. Seventeen percent of the sites are in inverted repeat pairs, many of which are located downstream to gene termini and are capable of forming stem-loop structures in messenger RNA that might function as signals for transcription termination.
TI  - Cloning of the pfaP gene of Leptospira borgpetersenii.
AB  - A lambda gt11 library constructed with Leptospira borgpetersenii DNA was screened with monoclonal antibodies (mAb) recognizing a periplasmic flagella-associated protein. A plaque expressing a fusion protein (lambda F15) which reacted with the mAb was isolated and the nucleotide sequence analyzed. The deduced amino-acid (aa) sequence indicates that the pfaP gene belongs to a group of bacterial genes whose products share aa sequence and possibly functional homologies with sppA, an Escherichia coli signal peptidase-encoding gene.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of furopenem against aerobic bacteria isolated from pediatric patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the oral penem furopenem (WY-49605, 545555, SUN5555, and ALP201) was tested against clinical bacteria isolated from pediatric patients. Furopenem was compared with clarithromycin, cefpodoxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefaclor, cefixime, and cefuroxime. Furopenem demonstrated consistent activity against Escherichia coli [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) = 1.0 microgram/ml)] Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC90 = 2.0 micrograms/ml), Salmonella enteriditis and Shigella spp. (MIC90 = 1.0 microgram/ml), and beta-lactamase-positive or -negative Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 = 1.0 microgram/ml) and Moraella catarrhalis (MIC90 = 1.0 microgram/ml). Furopenem was also active against a number of the Gram-positive organisms tested including methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae. These results suggest a potential application for this agent in the treatment of children as outpatients.
TI  - Efficacy of meropenem in experimental meningitis.
AB  - Meropenem and comparator antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, benzyl  penicillin and a combination of ampicillin plus gentamicin, were evaluated in a model of bacterial meningitis in the guinea-pig. The model is an acute infection in which challenge with each organism, if untreated, causes an increase in numbers of white blood cells, elevation of protein concentrations and 6-8 log10 cfu/mL of bacteria in the CSF. Infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, three strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (two penicillin-resistant), Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Listeria monocytogenes all responded to meropenem, which was as active as the comparator agents in all studies, and was more active in most. Of particular note were the results seen against S. pneumoniae (penicillin-resistant) infections, in which meropenem was significantly more effective than ceftriaxone. Also notable were results from the P. aeruginosa infection where meropenem, at low doses, was more effective than ceftazidime. Activity against L. monocytogenes was equivalent to that produced by treatment with the combination of ampicillin plus gentamicin, even when treatment was delayed. These results show that, in an animal model, meropenem penetrates into CSF in concentrations sufficient to produce significant reductions in the numbers of common and less common pathogens.
TI  - Ceftibuten: a review of antimicrobial activity, spectrum and other microbiologic  features.
AB  - Ceftibuten is a new, orally administered cephalosporin with exceptional beta-lactamase stability and potency against commonly isolated Gram-negative pathogens. More than 90% of recent Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates were inhibited by < or = 8 micrograms/ml of ceftibuten. In only five enteric species (Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens) were more than 15% of strains resistant (minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC, with percent of strains inhibited in subscript numbers) > 16 micrograms/ml) to ceftibuten. Enteritis-producing bacteria such as Salmonella, Shigella, Escherichia coli and Yersinia were very ceftibuten-susceptible (MIC50 < or = 0.13 microgram/ml). Fastidious Gram-negative species causing respiratory tract or genital infections had very low ceftibuten MICs, including beta-lactamase-positive Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 0.06 to 2 micrograms/ml), Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90 0.25 to 4 micrograms/ml), and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC90 0.015 to 0.5 microgram/ml). Beta-hemolytic streptococci and penicillin-susceptible pneumococci were also inhibited by ceftibuten. Staphylococci, enterococci, Pseudomonas species and Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria were generally resistant to ceftibuten. Ceftibuten has demonstrated bactericidal activity against susceptible pathogens, has high affinity for several lethal penicillin-binding proteins and possesses stability to common plasmid- or chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases, including those enzymes that hydrolyze parenteral third generation cephalosporins. The microbiologic features for ceftibuten indicate its clinical potential as chemotherapy for community-acquired respiratory tract infections.
TI  - SepA, the major extracellular protein of Shigella flexneri: autonomous secretion  and involvement in tissue invasion.
AB  - In addition to Ipa proteins and IcsA, which are involved in entry into epithelial cells and intercellular spread, respectively, Shigella secretes a 110 kDa protein, designated SepA. We report the identification, cloning, and nucleotide sequence determination of the sepA gene, analysis of SepA secretion, and construction and characterization of a sepA mutant. The sepA gene is carried by the virulence plasmid and codes for a 150 kDa precursor. Upon secretion, which does not involve accessory proteins encoded by the virulence plasmid, the precursor is converted to a mature protein of 110 kDa by two cleavages removing an N-terminal signal sequence and a C-terminal fragment. Extensive similarities were detected between the sequence of the first 500 residues of mature SepA and the N-terminal region of IgA1 proteases from Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae, the Tsh haemagglutinin of an avian pathogenic Escherichia coli, and the Hap protein involved in adhesion and penetration of H. influenzae. The C-terminal domain of the SepA precursor, which is not present in the secreted protein, exhibits sequence similarity with pertactin of Bordetella pertussis and the ring-forming protein of Helicobacter mustelae. Construction and phenotypic characterization of a sepA mutant indicated that SepA is required neither for entry into cultured epithelial cells nor for intercellular dissemination. However, in the rabbit ligated ileal loop model, the sepA mutant exhibited an attenuated virulence, which suggests that SepA might play a role in tissue invasion.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of a gene from Pasteurella haemolytica A1 involved in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis.
AB  - A Pasteurella haemolytica A1 gene involved in the biosynthesis of a moiety on the core of the lipopolysaccharide molecule has been cloned and characterized. Escherichia coli clones which carry this gene showed an alteration of its lipopolysaccharide migration profile on tricine SDS-PAGE and exhibited resistance to the core-specific phage U3. In addition, lipopolysaccharide extracted from the E. coli clones was recognized by an anti-corespecific antiserum, but not by antiserum specific for the O antigen of P. haemolytica A1 lipopolysaccharide. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the cloned DNA identified an open reading frame (lpsA) coding for a protein of 263 amino acids which showed significant homology with a Haemophilus influenzae type b lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis gene. PCR amplification of genomic DNA, using primers based on the P. haemolytica A1 lpsA sequence, yielded products from only the A biotypes of P. haemolytica.
TI  - DNA sequence and characterization of Haemophilus influenzae dprA+, a gene required for chromosomal but not plasmid DNA transformation.
AB  - Natural genetic transformation in Haemophilus influenzae involves DNA binding, uptake, translocation, and recombination. In this study, we cloned and sequenced a 3.8-kbp H. influenzae DNA segment capable of complementing in trans the transformation defect of an H. influenzae strain carrying the tfo-37 mutation. We used subcloning, deletion analysis, and in vivo protein labeling experiments to more precisely define the gene required for efficient DNA transformation on the cloned DNA. A novel gene, which we called dprA+, was shown to encode a 41.6-kDa polypeptide that was required for efficient chromosomal but not plasmid DNA transformation. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of DprA suggested that it may be an inner membrane protein, which is consistent with its apparent role in DNA processing during transformation. Four other open reading frames (ORFs) on the cloned DNA segment were identified. Two ORFs were homologous to the phosphofructokinase A (pfkA) and alpha-isopropyl malate synthase (leuA) genes of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, respectively. Homologs for the two other ORFs could not be identified.
TI  - Biochemical and genetic analyses of a catalase from the anaerobic bacterium Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - A single catalase enzyme was produced by the anaerobic bacterium Bacteroides fragilis when cultures at late log phase were shifted to aerobic conditions. In anaerobic conditions, catalase activity was detected in stationary-phase cultures, indicating that not only oxygen exposure but also starvation may affect the production of this antioxidant enzyme. The purified enzyme showed a peroxidatic activity when pyrogallol was used as an electron donor. It is a hemoprotein containing one heme molecule per holomer and has an estimated molecular weight of 124,000 to 130,000. The catalase gene was cloned by screening a B. fragilis library for complementation of catalase activity in an Escherichia coli catalase mutant (katE katG) strain. The cloned gene, designated katB, encoded a catalase enzyme with electrophoretic mobility identical to that of the purified protein from the B. fragilis parental strain. The nucleotide sequence of katB revealed a 1,461-bp open reading frame for a protein with 486 amino acids and a predicted molecular weight of 55,905. This result was very close to the 60,000 Da determined by denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified catalase and indicates that the native enzyme is composed of two identical subunits. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified catalase obtained by Edman degradation confirmed that it is a product of katB. The amino acid sequence of KatB showed high similarity to Haemophilus influenzae HktE (71.6% identity, 66% nucleotide identity), as well as to gram-positive bacterial and mammalian catalases. No similarities to bacterial catalase-peroxidase-type enzymes were found. The active-site residues, proximal and distal hemebinding ligands, and NADPH-binding residues of the bovine liver catalase-type enzyme were highly conserved in B. fragilis KatB.
TI  - Rapid bacterial antigen detection is not clinically useful.
AB  - Latex agglutination (LA) of capsular polysaccharide bacterial antigen is a frequently performed laboratory procedure, but its use is controversial. To assess the clinical utility of this test, we reviewed all LA tests performed over a 10-month period at two sites, a major university-based referral center and a private specialty pediatric hospital. Samples were assayed either individually or as a panel for the group B streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and three sets of Neisseria meningitidis serogroups (A and Y, C and W135, and B and Escherichia coli K1). Of 5,169 assays performed on 1,268 clinical samples (786 urine and 478 cerebrospinal fluid, 3 pleural fluid, and 1 synovial fluid sample), 57 (1.1%) were positive, including 1.7% of urine and 0.3% of cerebrospinal fluid samples. All LA true-positive cerebrospinal fluid samples showed the causative microorganisms by Gram stain. Detailed chart review of these 57 positive samples showed that the LA result was false-positive in 31 (54%), true-positive in 22 (38%), and indeterminate in 4 (7%) samples. Therapy was not altered on the basis of any of the true-positive LA results. The 31 false-positive results led to additional cost, prolonged hospitalization, and some clinical complications. Total patient charges were $175,000 ($7,954 per true-positive), with no detectable clinical benefit. Our retrospective study does not support the current use of LA for rapid antigen detection. What, if any, specific indications exist for this test remain to be elucidated.
TI  - Molecular and immunological characterization of a 64-kDa protein of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - The 64-kDa protein to which about half the sera from patients with localized juvenile periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis reacted strongly was purified from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4. Determination of the N-terminal sequence of the protein revealed that it was a GroEL-like protein. The DNA fragment containing the groEL gene of A. actinomycetemcomitans was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and the groESL operon was cloned by using colony hybridization with the amplified fragment from A. actinomycetemcomitans chromosomal DNA. Sequence analysis revealed that structures of the operon and its products were typical in gram-negative bacteria. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the 64-kDa protein cross-reacted with approximately 65-kDa proteins of Haemophilus aphrophilus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus paraphrophilus, Escherichia coli and Eikenella corrodens but not with any cellular proteins of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum. It is possible that antibodies reactive to the 64-kDa protein in periodontitis patients are induced by the cross-reactivity with the hsp60 proteins of other bacteria.
TI  - Bacterial agents causing chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  - Ear swabs from 350 patients with chronic otitis media attending different orthorhinolaryngological clinics at different hospitals and health centres in Benin City and Ekpoma in Edo State were screened for the presence of bacterial agents of chronic otitis media. Results revealed the presence of 19 different species indicating polymicrobial infections. Species isolated comprised Staphylococcus aureus (33.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.3%), Proteus mirabilis (17%), Alcaligenes faecalis (6.2%) and Klebsiella aerogenes (4.3%). Others included Escherichia coli (3.3%), Proteus rettgeri (2.8%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (2.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter spp, Proteus morgani, Haemophilus influenzae, Providencia spp, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, non-haemolytic streptococci and Diphotheroids, each accounted for less than 2% of isolates. The study also showed a higher prevalence of chronic otitis media among males (55.7%) than females (44.3%). Cases of chronic otitis media were highest among the age groups (0-5 years) with a prevalence rate of 50% and least among the 6-10 year age group with a prevalence rate of 14.9%. Antibiogram of isolates revealed marked sensitivities (over 90% of the isolates) to ciproxin, tarivid, rocephin and fortum whereas over 70% were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. Results have indicated that Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis are leading bacterial agents of otitis media and highlights the high risk involved in the use of penicillin, ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, cloxacillin and septrin in the management of chronic otitis media in our locality.
TI  - Third generation oral cephalosporins: comparative in vitro kinetics.
AB  - In order to provide additional data on the in vitro antibacterial activity of cefetamet-pivoxil against respiratory pathogens, we determined the bactericidal kinetics of this antibiotic in comparison to cefixime and ceftibuten against H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, K. pneumoniae, E. coli, S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. time-kill studies were performed by using concentrations equal to a x MIC, and 4 x MIC of the antibiotics tested and different inocula (10(5), 10(7) and 10(9) CFU/ml). The strains were incubated in a shaking incubator at 37 degrees C and 1 ml samples were removed at regular intervals for viable count determination. The antibiotics were eliminated by serial ten-fold dilutions in physiological saline before plating. At 4 x MIC of cefetamet and at 10(5) CFU/ml inoculum the results were 99.9% killing or more of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis at 4 h, and of E. coli and K. pneumoniae within 4 to 6 h, and of E. coli and K. pneumoniae within 4 to 6 h. At the same concentration of MIC and with the same inoculum a 99.9% reduction was achieved against S. pneumoniae within 4 h and against S. pyogenes within 2 h with no regrowth at 24 h in both cases. Similar results were obtained using 10(7) and 10(9) CFU/ml inocula. Cefetamet had efficient killing activity even at lower concentrations. Bactericidal kinetics of cefetamet favorably compare with those of cefixime and ceftibuten. The efficient bactericidal activity of cefetamet-pivoxil indicates a clinical role for this new oral cephalosporin in the treatment of respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Human immunoglobulin M paraproteins cross-reactive with Neisseria meningitidis group B polysaccharide and fetal brain.
AB  - Three hundred fifty-nine serum samples from patients with immunoglobulin M (IgM)  or IgG monoclonal gammopathies were tested for binding to the capsular polysaccharide (PS) of Neisseria meningitidis group B (MenB PS, poly-alpha[2-->8]-N-acetylneuraminic acid). Of 159 IgM paraproteins, 7 (4.4%) were positive, compared with 0 of 200 IgG paraproteins (P < 0.05). Since MenB PS reactivity was limited to the IgM paraproteins, the 159 IgM paraproteins were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for reactivity with seven other bacterial PSs. None reacted with meningococcal A or C, Haemophilus influenzae type b, or Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3, 6, 14, or 23 PS. The specificity of the MenB PS-reactive antibodies was confirmed by demonstration of binding to N. meningitidis group B cells but not to a capsular PS-deficient mutant and by specific inhibition of binding to solid-phase MenB PS by soluble MenB PS in an ELISA. Five of five antibodies tested protected infant rats from bacteremia caused by Escherichia coli K1, an organism with a PS capsule that also is composed of poly-alpha[2-->8]-N-acetylneuraminic acid. Each of the seven MenB PS-reactive paraproteins had autoantibody activity as defined by binding to homogenates of calf brain in a radioimmunoassay. For six of the seven antibodies, binding to calf brain was inhibited by the addition of soluble MenB PS. Thus, approximately 4% of human IgM paraproteins have autoantibody activity to poly-alpha[2-->8]-N-acetylneuraminic acid, an antigen expressed in fetal brain and cross-reactive with the MenB capsular PS. The reason for this skewing of the IgM paraprotein repertoire toward reactivity with poly-alpha[2-->8]-N-acetylneuraminic acid antigenic determinants is unknown.
TI  - Effect of age on concentrations of serum antibodies to viral, bacterial, and food antigens in elderly Swiss people.
AB  - Serum antibody concentrations to two viral, five bacterial, and two food antigens were investigated in 307 elderly Swiss subjects, and the hypothesis of whether serum antibody titers decreased with age was tested. The cross-sectional part of the study consisted of 216 unselected consecutive patients hospitalized in one geriatric hospital. The patients were divided into two age groups (65 to 84 and 85 to 102 years old), and their antibody titers were compared. No age-related decreases in antibody titers were observed. The members of the two age groups were well matched for medical diagnosis and nutritional and inflammatory status. The prospective part of the study consisted of 91 healthy elderly subjects living in the community; they were 71 to 76 years old when they were enrolled in the study. Their serum antibody status was measured at the beginning of the study and 4 years later. We observed a significant decrease in diphtheria antitoxin levels and a significant increase in antibody titer to the capsular polysaccharide of Streptococcus pneumoniae. No change in antibody titer to rotavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, lipopolysaccharide of Escherichia coli, C polysaccharide of S. pneumoniae, or the polyribosyl-ribitol phosphate of Haemophilus influenzae was observed. Thus, no signs of B-cell immunosenescence were seen in these two groups of elderly Swiss people.
TI  - TOC-39, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin with excellent activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - TOC-39, a new parenteral cephalosporin, is a hydroxyimino-type cephem antibiotic  with vinylthio-pyridyl moiety at the 3 position. TOC-39 was evaluated for antibacterial activity against various clinically isolated strains. TOC-39 had excellent activity, stronger than that of methicillin, oxacillin, the cephalosporins tested, imipenem, gentamicin, minocycline, tobramycin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and had an MIC comparable to that of vancomycin (the MICs of TOC-39 and vancomycin for 90% of the strains tested were 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively). Against Enterococcus faecalis strains, which are resistant to cephalosporins, TOC-39 was twice as active as ampicillin. Against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus pneumoniae, TOC-39 was twice as active as or more active than cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome. Against Streptococcus pyogenes, TOC-39 was superior to cefotiam, ceftazidime, and flomoxef and was similar to cefpirome. In addition, the activity of TOC-39 was equal to or greater than that of cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome against Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Morganella morganii. In terms of bactericidal effect against MRSA, TOC-39 was superior to vancomycin. No mutant resistant to TOC-39 or vancomycin was obtained from susceptible MRSA strains. In murine systemic infection models, TOC-39 showed potent activity against S. aureus and E. coli. Against highly MRSA, the activity of TOC-39 was comparable to that of vancomycin.
TI  - A single daily dose of ceftriaxone for bacterial meningitis in adults: experience with 84 patients and review of the literature.
AB  - Although the pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone allows its administration in a single daily dose, this practice is not standard in the treatment of bacterial meningitis. Herein, we review our experience and that of other investigators with this mode of therapy. We used a single daily dose of ceftriaxone (50 mg/[kg.d]; maximum, 4 g/d) for the treatment of bacterial meningitis in 84 adult patients. Meningitis was due to Neisseria meningitidis in 34 cases, to Streptococcus pneumoniae in 25, to Escherichia coli in three, to Klebsiella pneumoniae in two, to Haemophilus influenzae in two, to viridans streptococci in two, and to an unknown agent in 16. Eleven patients died, for an overall mortality of 13%; therapy failed in three additional cases. The mean trough levels of ceftriaxone in cerebrospinal fluid was 3.5 micrograms/mL; the median trough bactericidal titer at this site was 1:128. Both our experience and that in the literature suggest that a single daily dose is optimal when ceftriaxone is used for the treatment of bacterial meningitis.
TI  - PCR amplicon restriction endonuclease analysis of the chromosomal dhps gene of Neisseria meningitidis: a method for studying spread of the disease-causing strain in contacts of patients with meningococcal disease.
AB  - We tested two sets of primers derived from the dhps gene of Neisseria meningitidis for the amplification of meningococcal DNA by PCR. Both the NM1-NM6 primers and the NM3-NM6 primers amplified dhps DNA from all of the meningococci included in the study, resulting, in most cases, in amplicons of 0.70 and 0.23 kb, respectively. Also, dhps DNAs of N. gonorrhoeae and some commensals were amplified but Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli DNAs were not. By PCR amplicon restriction endonuclease analysis (AREA) of the larger amplicon, we could differentiate between individual strains of N. meningitidis. Following two cases of meningococcal disease, we used PCR AREA to identify healthy contacts carrying the disease-causing strain. We conclude that PCR AREA is a useful method for meningococcal strain differentiation and that it has potential as a method for studying the spread of a disease-causing strain in an affected population. The method is quicker and easier to perform and interpret than chromosomal DNA fingerprinting.
TI  - The sequencing of the 80-kDa D15 protective surface antigen of Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The 80-kDa D15 antigen (D-15-Ag) has previously been shown to be a target for protective immunity and conserved amongst typeable and nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae. Here, the gene encoding D-15-Ag is shown to encode a 797-aa polypeptide which, after cleavage of the predicted signal peptide, would have a molecular mass of 85,632 Da.
TI  - Genomic organization of the Klebsiella pneumoniae cps region responsible for serotype K2 capsular polysaccharide synthesis in the virulent strain Chedid.
AB  - The genomic organization of the chromosomal cps region that is responsible for capsular polysaccharide synthesis in Klebsiella pneumoniae Chedid (O1:K2) was investigated. Deletion analyses and Southern hybridization studies suggested that the central region of the cloned 29-kb BamHI fragment is indispensable for K2 capsular polysaccharide synthesis. The 24,329-bp nucleotide sequence of the Klebsiella cps region was determined and deposited in the EMBL and GenBank databases through DDBJ and assigned accession number D21242. Nineteen possible open reading frames (ORFs) were identified in the sequenced area. Among them, 13 ORFs are very close to each other. Six of the 19 ORFs show considerable nucleotide sequence similarities to Salmonella typhimurium cpsG, cpsB, rfbP, and orf2.8, Escherichia coli gnd, and Haemophilus influenzae bexD, respectively. Moreover, the deduced amino acid sequence of the ORF10 product demonstrated a highly hydrophobic profile and showed putative membrane topology similarity to Rickettsia prowazekii ATP/ADP translocase. Nucleotide sequence similar to the sigma 54-dependent promoter, as well as the usual -35 and -10 sequences, were identified just upstream of ORF3, which is the first ORF in the polycistronic structure. Furthermore, a sequence (GGGCGGTAGCGT) found just downstream of the sigma 54-dependent promoter-like sequence was generally conserved among gene clusters implicated in cell surface polysaccharide synthesis, such as Salmonella rfb and viaB and E. coli kpsMT and rfaQPG. A possible transcriptional terminator with a hairpin loop structure found just downstream of ORF15 that is a homolog of E. coli gnd. K2 capsular polsaccharide biosynthesis in E. coli K-12 depends on cpsB (mannose-1-phosphate guanyltransferase gene), and Klebsiella cpsB, found in the downstream region of the polycistronic structure, was able to complement cpsB of E. coli. Results of transposon insertion and promoter-cloning analyses were consistent with the results of nucleotide sequence analysis.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of sulbactam/ampicillin against clinically isolated microbial strains].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities were examined for sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) against clinically isolated microbial strains in 1987, 1990, 1994. Besides, the beta-lactamase productivity and MICs of these strains were measured, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. The ratio of beta-lactamase producing strains were 90% of methicillin (DMPPC)-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus (MSSA), about 80% of DMPPC-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 100% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, 95% of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis and 15-20% of Haemophilus influenzae. Several kinds of beta-lactamase productivity were observed. 2. Antimicrobial activities of SBT/ABPC against beta-lactamase producing strains of MSSA, M. (B.) catarrhalis, H. influenzae, and almost all of Enterobacteriaceae were stronger than those of ampicillin (ABPC) and piperacillin (PIPC), but antimicrobial activities of SBT/ABPC were weak against MRSA and cephems (CEPs)-resistant strains detected in some of Enterobacteriaceae. 3. It appeared that benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP) or PCG-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) and CEPs-resistant Escherichia coli increased year by year. 4. Antimicrobial activities of SBT/ABPC were strong against Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, M. (B.) catarrhalis and H. influenzae including beta-lactamase producing strains. Additionally, beta-lactamase inhibiting effect of SBT was observed against beta-lactamase produced by S. aureus and K. pneumoniae which demonstrate indirect pathogenicity. Thus, SBT/ABPC is an injectable antibiotic that is expected to demonstrate clinical usefulness, especially as the first line drug for the respiratory tract infections that are community-acquired.
TI  - Comparative activities of pefloxacin and ciprofloxacin in the treatment of chronic respiratory tract infections.
AB  - To determine the efficacy in vivo of pefloxacin and ciprofloxacin in the treatment of acute infectious bronchopneumopathies, 90 patients, suffering from acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and with no known allergies to quinolones, were admitted to the study. Patients were randomly divided into three groups of 30; the first group was dosed with pefloxacin 800 mg i.v. every 24 hours; the second group with pefloxacin 800 mg per os every 24 hours and the third with 500 mg per os of ciprofloxacin every 12 hours. Blood and bronchial secretion samples were simultaneously collected 2, 4, 8, 12, 14 and 24 hours after the first daily dose of antibiotic. Serum and bronchial secretion concentrations of pefloxacin and ciprofloxacin were determined by using a microbiological agar disk diffusion assay, employing Escherichia coli Kp 712 as test organism. Eradication of responsible microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis) were achieved in 98% of patients around 72 hours post treatment. Generally, both antibiotics expressed similar bactericidal properties when orally administered, while intravenous administration of pefloxacin displays a more rapid antibacterial action in comparison with the oral administration schedules. Maximal concentrations of both drugs in bronchial secretion were recorded at the same time after treatment (4 hours), with concentrations of about 2.5 micrograms/ml. Pefloxacin, having a longer half-life, was found 24 hours post-treatment with plasma concentrations of 1.5 micrograms/ml following a single oral dose of 800 mg. Ciprofloxacin, having a shorter half-life, showed a peak of about 1 microgram/ml, 12 hours after administration (500 mg/12 hours/os).
TI  - Pasteurella multocida produces a protein with homology to the P6 outer membrane protein of Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - An antibody specific for a 16-kDa outer membrane protein of a rabbit strain of Pasteurella multocida was used to probe representatives of all 16 somatic serotypes of P. multocida, as well as the vaccine strains CU and M9, and all were shown to express the protein. The gene encoding this protein was cloned and sequenced and found to have extensive sequence homology with the gene encoding the P6 protein of Haemophilus influenzae. The protein in P. multocida has been designated P6-like. The gene encoding the P6-like protein was used to probe members of the family Pasteurellaceae and other gram-negative bacteria. Representatives of all 16 somatic serotypes (as well as the vaccine strains CU and M9) of P. multocida hybridized with the P6-like gene under conditions of high stringency. The DNA from H. influenzae hybridized weakly with the P6-like gene under these conditions, but Pasteurella haemolytica (representatives of A and T biotypes), Bordetella bronchiseptica, B. avium, Actinobacillus suis, A. suis-like, A. lignieresii, A. ureae, A. rossii, A. pleuropneumoniae, A. equuli, and various members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella typhimurium) did not hybridize detectably. Under conditions of lower stringency, the P6-like gene also hybridized strongly with DNA from P. multocida, H. influenzae, and A. rossii but weakly with DNA from P. haemolytica and members of the genus Actinobacillus. These results suggest that the P6-like protein of P. multocida might be useful as an immunizing product to protect poultry from avian cholera. This suggestion stems from (i) our finding that the P6-like protein in P. multocida is widely distributed among all the somatic serotypes and (ii) the previous work of others demonstrating that the P6 protein of H. influenzae elicits a protective immune response in animal models of human disease.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of the nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae  2019 rfaE gene required for lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis.
AB  - The lipooligosaccharide (LOS) of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is an  important factor in pathogenesis and virulence. In an attempt to elucidate the genes involved in LOS biosynthesis, we have cloned the rfaE gene from NTHi 2019 by complementing a Salmonella typhimurium rfaE mutant strain with an NTHi 2019 plasmid library. The rfaE mutant synthesizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS) lacking heptose, and the rfaE gene is postulated to be involved in ADP-heptose synthesis. Retransformation with the plasmid containing 4 kb of NTHi DNA isolated from a reconstituted mutant into rfaE mutants gave wild-type LPS phenotypes. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis confirmed the conversion of the rfaE mutant LPS to a wild-type LPS phenotype. Sequence analysis of a 2.4-kb BglII fragment revealed two open reading frames. One open reading frame encodes the RfaE protein with a molecular weight of 37.6 kDa, which was confirmed by in vitro transcription and translation, and the other encodes a polypeptide highly homologous to the Escherichia coli HtrB protein. These two genes are transcribed from the same promoter region into opposite directions. Primer extension analysis of the rfaE gene revealed a single transcription start site at 37 bp upstream of the predicted translation start site. The upstream promoter region contained a sequence (TA AAAT) homologous to the -10 region of the bacterial sigma 70-dependent promoters at an appropriate distance (7 bp), but not sequence resembling the consensus sequence of the -35 region was found. These studies demonstrate the ability to use complementation of defined LPS defects in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae to identify LOS synthesis genes in NTHi.
TI  - [Nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1991. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and CNS showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (DMPPC). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. Though Enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (ABPC), piperacillin (PIPC), imipenem (IPM), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST) compounds, Enterococcus faecium was resistant to almost all antibacterial agents but to ST compounds. High susceptibility rates were observed for strains of Enterobacter cloacae to IPM, gentamicin (GM) and ofloxacin (OFLX) and for strains of Proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (LMOX), IPM, aztreonam (AZT), GM and OFLX. Serratia marcescens and Bacteroides fragilis group were highly susceptible only to IPM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (CAZ), IPM, amikacin (AMK) and tobramycin (TOB). Pseudomonas cepacia was relatively susceptible only to CAZ. IPM showed strong antibacterial activity to many species except for S. aureus and CNS.
TI  - National survey of the in vitro spectrum of piperacillin-tazobactam tested against more than 40,000 aerobic clinical isolates from 236 medical centers.
AB  - Hospital microbiology laboratories from 41 states participated in a bacterial antimicrobial susceptibility study comparing in vitro results generated by the standardized disk diffusion method. Over 41,000 freshly isolated aerobic and facultative strains, representing all specimen types (except stools and urines), were tested for their susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam and 21 other antimicrobial agents. Enterococcus spp. was the second or third most common isolate from intraabdominal, gynecologic, and cutaneous infections, confirming its growing importance as a nosocomial pathogen. Escherichia coli was the most frequent isolate overall, despite the exclusion of urinary tract specimens from the study. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the second most prevalent species, ranking first in frequency of recovery from lower-respiratory-tract specimens. Piperacillin-tazobactam was the most active beta-lactamase inhibitor combination tested against Gram-negative bacteria. Its activity against Gram-positive bacteria and Haemophilus influenzae was similar to that of ampicillin-sulbactam (95-97% susceptible). Imipenem and piperacillin-tazobactam displayed similar spectrums of activity against Gram-positive organisms and Haemophilus influenzae. Against Enterobacteriaceae, piperacillin-tazobactam and ceftazidime exhibited similarly wide spectrums of activity, but with some gaps, particularly among Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii. In this large-scale in vitro study, piperacillin-tazobactam and imipenem displayed the widest antimicrobial spectrums, inhibiting > 90% of all isolates tested.

TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of apalcillin alone and combined with Ro 48-1220, a novel penam beta-lactamase inhibitor.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The in vitro activity of apalcillin plus Ro 48-1220, a novel penam sulfone beta-lactamase inhibitor, was compared with apalcillin alone, piperacillin/tazobactam, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, imipenem, ceftazidime and cefepime. METHODS: Agar dilution and broth microdilution testing of 854 bacterial strains, subcultured from frozen stocks incubated for 24 h in 5% carbon dioxide, was carried out to determine the minimum bactericidal (MBC) and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of each of the study drugs in accordance with the NCCLS M26-T method. RESULTS: Apalcillin/Ro 48-1220 was active against all gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates except Klebsiella oxytoca (MIC90 32 microg/mL). Among the Enterobacteriaceae, synergy for apalcillin/Ro 48-1220 (4 microg/mL fixed concentration) vs apalcillin alone was demonstrated for nearly all species when comparing MIC90 results. Apalcillin/Ro 48-1220 was highly potent against beta-lactamase-producing Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MICs less-than-or-equal 1 microg/mL). However, much of this activity was due to the direct antimicrobial action of Ro 48-1220 alone (MICs less-than-or-equal 4 microg/mL). All Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia and Acinetobacter species were inhibited by apalcillin/Ro 48-1220 (MIC90 0.25 to 4 microg/mL). For the aerobic gram-positive organisms, none of the drugs tested were consistently effective against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, Corynebacterium jeikeium and Enterococcus species other than E. faecalis. Apalcillin/Ro 48-1220 was as effective as piperacillin/tazobactam against Escherichia coli producing extended-spectrum TEM enzymes, but less active against isolates producing SHV-type beta-lactamases. When tested against 204 ceftazidime-, gentamicin- or fluoroquinolone-resistant organisms, 78%, 91% and 66% of strains, respectively, were susceptible to apalcillin/Ro 48-1220 (less-than-or-equal 16 microg/mL). CONCLUSIONS: Apalcillin/Ro 48-1220 is bactericidal with a modest inoculum effect; its wide spectrum of activity favors continued studies of spectrum, pharmacokinetics and in vivo efficacy.
TI  - The gene encoding protein D (hpd) is highly conserved among Haemophilus influenzae type b and nontypeable strains.
AB  - The molecular conservation of a surface-exposed lipoprotein, protein D, of Haemophilus influenzae was studied by cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding protein D from three encapsulated type b strains and three nontypeable strains of H. influenzae. These nucleotide sequences were analyzed with previously reported sequences from one type b strain and one nontypeable strain. The nucleotide sequences and the deduced amino acid sequences for protein D were highly conserved. The deduced amino acid sequence (364 amino acids) of protein D from six strains differed only in two amino acids near the C-terminal end. The remaining two strains, one type b and one nontypeable, differed from the consensus sequence in 7 amino acids each. Protein D is 64 and 36% identical and 77 and 56% similar to the glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterases (GlpQ) of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies of SY5555 in the pediatric field].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on SY5555, a new oral penem, were carried out, and the following results were obtained. 1. MICs were determined for 6 drugs, SY5555, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (CVA/AMPC), cefaclor (CCL), cefotiam (CTM), cefpodoxime (CPDX), cefdinir (CFDN) against 20 strains of bacteria isolated from patients who were subsequently treated with SY5555. MICs of SY5555 for Gram-positive cocci ranged from 0.05 to 0.10 microgram/ml against 10 strains of Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC was < or = 0.025 microgram/ml against one strain of Streptococcus pyogenes, and MICs were from < or = 0.025 to 0.39 microgram/ml against Streptococcus pneumoniae. These MIC values were equivalent or superior to those of the other 5 drugs. MICs of SY5555 for Gram-negative bacilli were 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml against Haemophilus influenzae, and these values were equivalent to those of the other drugs, except CPDX. The MIC of SY5555 was 0.39 microgram/ml against 2 strains of Escherichia coli, and this value was equivalent or superior to those of CVA/AMPC and CCL, similar or inferior to those of CPDX and CFDN, and inferior to that of CTM. The MICs of several drugs were determined for 10 strains of Bordetella pertussis and 30 strains of Campylobacter jejuni isolated from patients before this clinical study. The MICs of SY5555 against the 10 strains of B. pertussis were compared with those of 7 drugs, CCL, CTM, CPDX, ampicillin (ABPC), piperacillin (PIPC), imipenem (IPM) and erythromycin (EM). The MIC of SY5555 was 0.78 microgram/ml against all of the strains. This value was superior to those of CCL, CTM and CPDX, similar or inferior to that of IPM and inferior to those of PIPC and EM. The MICs of SY5555 against the 30 strains of C. jejuni were compared with those of 7 drugs. CCL, CTM, CPDX, CFDN, ABPC, IPM and EM, and the MIC of SY5555 was < or = 0.025 microgram/ml or 0.05 microgram/ml and these values were equivalent or superior to those of the 7 reference drugs. 2. SY5555 dry syrup was administered orally at 30 min. after meals, to a total of 5 patients, at doses of 5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg to 2 patients each and at a dose of 15.0 mg/kg to one patient and the plasma concentrations were determined. Peak concentrations were detected 1 to 3 hours after administration in all patients and the peak concentrations were 0.93 and 1.21 micrograms/ml at the 5.0 mg/kg dose, 2.85 and 5.49 micrograms/ml at the 10.0 mg/kg dose and 5.79 micrograms/ml at the 15.0 mg/kg dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Bacteriological and clinical studies of SY5555 in pediatric field].
AB  - Clinical studies were carried out on SY5555, a new oral penem, in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized below. The clinical efficacies were examined in a total 31 patients consisting of 4 patients with pharyngitis, 10 with purulent tonsillitis, 4 with scarlet fever, 7 with impetigo, one with balanitis, one with cellulitis and 4 with UTI. The clinical efficacy rate was 96.8% (30/31). Bacteriological efficacies of SY5555 were examined on identified pathogens including 7 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 6 of Streptococcus pyogenes, 3 of Enterococcus faecalis, 3 of Haemophilus influenzae, one of Escherichia coli and one of Citrobacter freundii. The bacteriological eradication rate was 81.0%. As for side effects, loose stool in one patient was noted. Abnormal laboratory findings test results included eosinophilia in 2 patients, eosinophilia and elevation of serum transaminase in one patient, and thrombocytosis in another.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: a multi-center study in five Mediterranean countries.
AB  - In 5 Mediterranean countries 7902 pathogens, all isolated in 1992 and 1993 from community-acquired infections, were studied for susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin G, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid (both 2:1 ratio), cefalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. Ten centers in Italy, 4 centers in Greece, 3 centers in Spain, and 1 center in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia contributed to this study; all centers used performed standardized microtiter panels (Sceptor, BBL, Heidelberg, FRG). The most frequently isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli (n = 1267), Proteus mirabilis (n = 843), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 771), enteric Salmonella spp. (n = 629), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 486), Citrobacter freundii (n = 383), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 346), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 298), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 294), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 246), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 243), and Shigella spp. (n = 185). Statistical analysis was performed for each of the above countries and for all pooled data available. The penicillin antibiotics were the most active compounds against the gram-positive cocci, exceeding the MIC90 values 2- to 8-fold over all cephalosporins. Regarding the gram-negatives (above all Klebsiella spp.) cefetamet was by far the most active compound (MIC90 = 1 mg/l). Regarding the percentage of resistant isolates, there were no striking discrepancies between the centers and countries involved in this study. There was, however, complete cross-resistance in penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates (MIC90 = 2 mg/l). By far the majority of the penicillin-resistant pneumococci showed additional resistance to doxycycline and erythromycin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the Haemophilus influenzae exbB and exbD genes.
AB  - The exbB and exbD genes of Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) were cloned and sequenced. The deduced Hi ExbB and ExbD proteins possessed 27 and 28% amino-acid identity (56 and 58% relatedness) with the Escherichia coli ExbB and ExbD proteins, respectively; two proteins which function as TonB accessory proteins during biopolymer transport. Plasmid-encoded Hi exbB and exbD partially complemented an E. coli exbB/exbD mutation.
TI  - Production of Haemophilus influenzae type-b porin in Escherichia coli and its folding into the trimeric form.
AB  - The P2 protein from pathogenic Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) functions as a bacterial porin and is one of several immunogenic outer membrane proteins. The P2 gene was expressed in Escherichia coli and the recombinant P2 protein (re-P2) purified to facilitate functional and immunologic studies. P2 was obtained from Hib strain Eagan using PCR and the pET vectors (17b and 11a) were used to produce re-P2 at levels exceeding 30% of the total E. coli proteins. Since previous reports had indicated that P2 was toxic to E. coli, steps were taken to control the toxicity. The plasmid was stabilized by tightly controlling the synthesis of re-P2 prior to induction. Subsequent to induction, re-P2 was sequestered into inclusion bodies rather than to membrane compartments. The refolding of the denatured re-P2 into the trimeric form involved high salt and calcium ions. re-P2 was then purified to homogeneity using gel-filtration and ion-exchange chromatography.

AB  - The antibacterial activity of DQ-2556, a new cephalosporin, was compared with that of cefepime, cefpirome, and other antibiotics. DQ-2556 was more active than cefepime and less active than cefpirome against gram-positive bacteria. DQ-2556 was the most active compound against most members of the Enterobacteriaceae, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Proteus, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp., and Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In vivo, treatment with DQ-2556 was as or more efficacious than that with reference compounds in both systemic and respiratory tract infections in mice. DQ-2556 achieved higher concentrations than cefepime and cefpirome in lungs and kidney of mice.
TI  - Trends in antimicrobial resistance among today's bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Resistance of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens to antimicrobial agents is a serious problem with significant clinical consequences. Microbiologic surveillance data, such as those provided by the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System, supply information on current nosocomial pathogens in the United States. Many species show resistance to commonly used antimicrobials and, in many cases, it is emerging resistance. Resistance in many gram-negative bacteria is caused by beta-lactamase production. Escherichia coli, the leading nosocomial pathogen, is capable of hyperproducing TEM-1 beta-lactamase. A novel form of resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae and E. coli is caused by extended-spectrum cephalosporinases. Many Enterobacteriaceae can be induced to produce group 1 beta-lactamase by exposure to broad-spectrum cephalosporins and other beta-lactams. Thirty percent of Haemophilus influenzae isolates are resistant to ampicillin because of beta-lactamase production. Issues of concern in gram-positive species include multiple antimicrobial resistance in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci, and increasing beta-lactam resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae. To minimize the development of resistance, antimicrobials must be administered judiciously, and infection-control practices must be instituted and followed.
TI  - Evidence that surface fibrils expressed by Haemophilus influenzae type b promote  attachment to human epithelial cells.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae type b is a Gram-negative bacillus that initiates infection by colonizing the upper respiratory tract. Previous studies have established that H. influenzae haemagglutinating pili possess adhesive properties and influence the process of colonization. Additional studies suggest the presence of a second H. influenzae adhesin distinct from haemagglutinating pili. In the present study, we examined a non-piliated H. influenzae type b strain by transmission electron microscopy and visualized occasional short, thin, surface fibrils. Subsequently, we isolated a spontaneous mutant that lacked surface fibrils and was deficient in adherence to cultured human epithelial cells. Using a cloning strategy that exploited this mutant, we isolated a fragment of DNA that promotes in vitro adherence to human epithelial cells when expressed in laboratory strains of Escherichia coli. Mutagenesis of this fragment in a series of H. influenzae type b strains resulted in loss of expression of surface fibrils and a marked decrease in attachment. Furthermore, restoration of surface fibril expression was associated with reacquisition of wild-type levels of adherence. Our results are consistent with the conclusion that H. influenzae type b surface fibrils have adhesive capacity. We speculate that these organelles facilitate colonization of the human respiratory tract.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of SY5555 dry syrup in the pediatric field].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on SY5555 dry syrup (powder which is dissolved before use), a new penem antibiotic for oral use, were performed. The following results were obtained. 1. Antibacterial activities. MICs of SY5555, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (CVA/AMPC), cefotiam (CTM), cefpodoxime (CPDX), cefaclor (CCL) and cefdinir (CFDN) were determined against clinically isolated Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae at a dose of 10(6) CFU/ml. MICs of SY5555 against S. aureus, CNS, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, E. coli and E. cloacae were 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, < or = 0.025, 0.78, 0.2, 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively, showing excellent antibacterial effects on these pathogens. Although the effects of SY 5555 against H. influenzae and E. coli were slightly inferior to those of CPDX and CFDN, the drug showed the most excellent antibacterial effect on other strains as compared with the control drugs. 2. Absorption and excretion In this study, plasma concentrations and urinary recovery rates were examined after administration of SY5555 at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg (potency) after meals. With both 5 and 10 mg/kg doses, peak plasma concentrations were reached 1 hour after administration, at 0.25-2.61 micrograms/ml (mean 1.47 micrograms/ml) and 1.08-2.17 micrograms/ml (mean 1.74 micrograms/ml), respectively. The plasma levels rapidly decreased to 0.06-0.19 micrograms/ml (0.12 micrograms/ml) and 0.0503-0.0637 micrograms/ml) after 6 hours. The half-lives 1.12 hours in the 5 mg/kg group and 1.0 hour in the 10 mg/kg group. The urinary recovery rates were determined in the first 8 hours after administration in the 5 mg/kg and 6 hours in the 10 mg/kg group, and the values were as low as 1.05-12.3% and 1.6-4.33%, respectively. 3. Clinical results The clinical responses were examined in a total of 73 cases including 4 acute pneumonia, 13 acute bronchitis, 11 tonsillitis, 3 pharyngitis, 12 scarlet fever, 2 pertussis, 6 urinary tract infection, 6 otitis media, 7 lymphadenitis, 2 staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, 2 phlegmon, 4 impetigo and 1 purulent parotitis. The treatment was effective or better in 66 of 70 cases with an efficacy rate of 94.3% (3 undeterminable cases were excluded). Bacteriological effects were examined during the clinical course for detected or suspected pathogens found before administration of SY5555. The effects were determined in 50 cases including 7 cases of polymicrobacterial infections, 57 strains in total. Eight strains, however, persisted, hence the overall eradication rate was 86.0%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies on SY5555 in children].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on SY5555 were performed in children. The results were as follows: 1. A total of 15 patients considered to have bacterial infections were treated with SY5555. Each dose, 5 mg/kg, was orally administered 3 times daily, for 4-11 days. Clinical efficacies of SY5555 in 13 patients with bacterial infections (1 with pneumonia, 2 with bronchitis, each 1 with maxillary sinusitis, 2 with otitis media, 5 with pharyngitis, 1 each with gastroenteritis and pyelonephritis) were evaluated as excellent in 10 patients and as good in 3 patients with an efficacy rate of 100%. Two patients with viral infection and malignant lymphoma were not evaluated. Thirteen causative strains in 7 species were found in 10 patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae in 1/3, Haemophilus influenzae in 2/2, Streptococcus pyogenes 4/4, Salmonella spp. in 1/1, Escherichia coli in 1/1 were eradicated. Only one patient developed mild diarrhea as an adverse reaction. Another patient showed elevated GPT (glutamate pyruvate transaminase). The abnormality was mild and the patient recovered after the cessation of SY5555 administration without specific treatment. 2. MICs of SY5555 were examined against 33 clinical isolates. SY5555 has low MICs against Enterococcus faecalis and other Gram-positive cocci. 3. Pharmacokinetic studies Peak plasma concentrations of SY5555 was 1.15 micrograms/ml at a dose level of 4.9 mg/kg orally administered at fasting. Based on the above results and the broad spectrum of the anti-bacterial activities, SY5555 appears to be a promising antibiotics that is usable as a single agent for the primary therapy of respiratory tract infections, skin soft tissue infections and urinary tract infections in children.
TI  - Cloning, analysis and expression of the HindIII R-M-encoding genes.
AB  - The genes encoding the HindIII restriction endonuclease (R.HindIII ENase) and methyltransferase (M.HindIII MTase) from Haemophilus influenzae Rd were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and their nucleotide (nt) sequences were determined. The genes are transcribed in the same orientation, with the ENase-encoding gene (hindIIIR) preceding the MTase-encoding gene (hindIIIM). The two genes overlap by several nt. The ENase is predicted to be 300 amino acids (aa) in length (34,950 Da); the MTase is predicted to be 309 aa (35,550 Da). The HindIII ENase and MTase activities increased approx. 20-fold when the genes were brought under the control of an inducible lambda pL promoter. Highly purified HindIII ENase and MTase proteins were prepared and their N-terminal aa sequences determined. In H. influenzae Rd, the HindIII R-M genes are located between the holC and valS genes; they are not closely linked to the HindII R-M genes.
TI  - Construction of an ori cassette for adapting shuttle vectors for use in Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - An ori (origin of DNA replication) cassette, pORC, containing the P15a ori and the kanamycin-resistance-encoding gene from Tn5, was constructed. The cassette was used to convert an Escherichia coli promoter selection vector, which gene from Tn5, was constructed. The cassette was used to convert an Escherichia coli promoter selection vector, which contains a promoterless chloramphenicol (Cm) acetyltransferase-encoding gene (cat) downstream from a multiple cloning site (MCS) [Brosius and Lupski, Methods Enzymol. 153 (1987) 54-68], to an E. coli-Haemophilus influenzae shuttle vector. The shuttle vector, pQL1, was shown to transform E. coli and H. influenzae efficiently. H. influenzae promoters were cloned into pQL1 by ligation of Sau3A-digested H. influenzae chromosomal fragments. Selection and semiquantitative analysis of promoter strength were performed on agar plates containing different concentrations of Cm. With the use of pQL1, H. influenzae gene regulation can now be studied in either H. influenzae or E. coli. In addition, elements of pORC can be used to convert other specialized E. coli vectors to E. coli-H. influenzae shuttle vectors.
TI  - Genetic locus for the biosynthesis of the variable portion of Neisseria gonorrhoeae lipooligosaccharide.
AB  - A locus involved in the biosynthesis of gonococcal lipooligosaccharide (LOS) has  been cloned from gonococcal strain F62. The locus contains five open reading frames. The first and second reading frames are homologous, but not identical, to the fourth and fifth reading frames, respectively. Interposed is an additional reading frame which has distant homology to the Escherichia coli rfaI and rfaI genes, both glucosyl transferases involved in lipopolysaccharide core biosynthesis. The second and fifth reading frames show strong homology to the lex-1 or lic2A gene of Haemophilus influenzae, but do not contain the CAAT repeats found in this gene. Deletions of each of these five genes, of combinations of genes, and of the entire locus were constructed and introduced into parental gonococcal strain F62 by transformation. The LOS phenotypes were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and reactivity with monoclonal antibodies. Analysis of the gonococcal mutants indicates that four of these genes are the glycosyl transferases that add GalNAc beta 1-->3Gal beta 1-->4GlcNAc beta 1-->3 Gal beta 1--4 to the substrate Glc beta 1-->4Hep--R of the inner core region. The gene with homology to E. coli rfaI/rfaI is involved with the addition of the alpha-linked galactose residue in the biosynthesis of the alternative LOS structure Gal alpha 1-->4Gal beta 1-->4Glc beta 1-->4Hep-->R. Since these genes encode LOS glycosyl transferases they have been named lgtA, lgtB, lgtC, lgtD, and lgtE. The DNA sequence analysis revealed that lgtA, lgtC, and lgtD contained poly-G tracts, which, in strain F62 were, respectively, 17, 10, and 11 bp. Thus, three of the LOS biosynthetic enzymes are potentially susceptible to premature termination by reading frame changes. It is likely that these structural features are responsible for the high-frequency genetic variation of gonococcal LOS.
TI  - Opsonic activity of commercially available standard intravenous immunoglobulin preparations.
AB  - Several standard intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG) products are available in the United States and have been used with the intent to treat or prevent infections in neonates. We evaluated more than 100 lots of IVIG, from 6 products, to determine the amount of opsonic antibody against neonatal pathogens. Neutrophil-mediated opsonophagocytosis was used to determine opsonic activity in these preparations for Staphylococcus epidermidis; Haemophilus influenzae type b; Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 3, 14 and 19; Group B Streptococcus serotypes Ia, Ib, Ia/c, II and III; and Escherichia coli (K1). Pathogen-specific opsonic activity of the lots tested ranged from undetectable to 1:80 and was detectable in < 10% to > 90% of lots tested depending on the organism and manufacturer. Within an IVIG lot there was variable opsonic activity against different strains or serotypes of the same organism. Opsonic activity was significantly (P < or = 0.05) affected by the manufacturer's donor pool and less so by the manufacturing method. We conclude that the pathogen-specific opsonic antibody activity of an IVIG lot is: (1) highly variable for several common neonatal pathogens; (2) predominantly dependent on the donor pool and not the manufacturing method. Clinicians may more appropriately select therapy if the pathogen-specific antibody content of IVIG products by lot are known. In the future neonatal IVIG research should focus on using preparations with known pathogen-specific antibody activity.
TI  - Development of a polymerase chain reaction assay to detect the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae DNA.
AB  - In this study, we have developed a chemically sensitive and specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae genomic DNA. The target DNA sequence was a 322-base pair segment of the S. pneumoniae DNA polymerase I gene (pol I). PCR products of pure cultures of a set of pneumococcal serotypes commonly associated with human infection could be amplified in water and in blood cultures of clinical isolates containing S. pneumoniae. We were able to detect 2 fg of purified S. pneumoniae DNA. There were no false-positive reactions when the assay was performed on samples containing the following clinically encountered bacteria: Haemophilus influenzae type B, Neisseria meningitidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas spp. nontypeable H. influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The addition of EDTA and citrate-anticoagulated whole blood to the PCR reaction mixture inhibited the PCR assay, whereas the addition of lithium heparin, sodium heparin, and sodium polyanetholesulfonate-anticoagulated whole blood to PCR reaction mixture did not interfere with the ability to detect the presence of S. pneumoniae DNA.
TI  - The dipeptide permease of Escherichia coli closely resembles other bacterial transport systems and shows growth-phase-dependent expression.
AB  - The dipeptide permease (Dpp) of Escherichia coli transports peptides consisting of two or three L-amino acids. The periplasmic dipeptide-binding protein (DBP), encoded by the dppA gene, also serves as a chemoreceptor. We sequenced the dpp locus, which comprises an operon of five genes, dppABCDE. Its organization is the same as the oligopeptide permease (opp) operon of Salmonella typhimurium and the spo0K operon of Bacillus subtilis. The dpp genes are also closely related to the hbpA gene, which encodes a haem-binding lipoprotein, and four other genes in an unlinked operon of unknown function in Haemophilus influenzae. Each Dpp protein has an Opp, Spo0K and H. influenzae homologue. Transcription of the dpp operon initiates 165 bases upstream of the predicted dppA start codon. The start site for transcription is preceded by potential -35 and -10 regions of a sigma 70 promoter. During exponential growth in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth, the level of dpp mRNA increases in two steps, one between A590 0.2 and 0.4 and one between A590 0.7 and 1.0. The 310 nucleotides between dppA and dppB include a RIP (repetitive IHF-binding palindromic) element, whose deletion from a multi-copy plasmid causes fivefold and 10-fold reductions in the levels of upstream and downstream dpp mRNA, respectively.
TI  - Identification of hifD and hifE in the pilus gene cluster of Haemophilus influenzae type b strain Eagan.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae produces surface structures called pili that promote adherence to human cells. Three genes encoding the major pilus structural component (pilin), chaperone, and usher proteins (designated hifA, -B, and -C, respectively) have been identified previously. In this study, transposon mutagenesis and DNA sequence analysis identified two open reading frames (ORFs) downstream of, and in the same orientation as, hifC. These genes have been designated hifD and hifE. Both genes have predicted C-terminal amino acid homology to HifA, and mutations in either gene resulted in the loss of morphologic and functional pili, indicating that hifD and hifE encode pilus structural components and are required for pilus expression. Another ORF, identified immediately downstream of hifE, has a predicted amino acid sequence that is 70% identical to an aminopeptidase of Escherichia coli called PepN, and a mutation within this ORF did not alter pilus expression. These data indicate that the pepN homolog is not required for pilus biogenesis and that one end of the pilus gene cluster has been defined.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacterial isolates at the American University Medical Center in Lebanon.
AB  - In Lebanon, knowledge of the prevailing pattern of bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents has been limited, particularly because of 15 years of civil strife. Thus, the current study was conducted to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of nonselected bacterial isolates recovered from recent clinical specimens, using the standardized disk agar diffusion technique. A total of 5216 isolates (1443 Gram positive and 3773 Gram negative) were examined. Over 92% of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were resistant to penicillins. Methicillin resistance was more frequently noted among CNS (28%) compared with S. aureus (18%). For the pneumococci, 27% of the isolates were resistant to penicillin G. High but variable rates of multidrug resistance were encountered among Acinetobacter spp., Pseudomonas spp., Serratia spp., Citrobacter spp., and Enterobacter spp. Ampicillin resistance was detected in 65% of Escherichia coli and in 20% of Haemophilus influenzae isolates. Although one resistant Salmonella typhi strain was observed, 17% of other Salmonella spp. and 60% of Shigella spp. proved to be resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and cotrimoxazole. Among Vibrio cholerae isolates, high resistance to tetracycline (71%) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (94%) was observed. The overall antimicrobial resistance rates in Lebanon seem to fall between figures reported from the Arabian Gulf countries (higher) and those from medical centers in the United States (lower).
TI  - Laparoscopic study on the microbiology and severity of acute pelvic inflammatory  disease.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the microbiologic findings in relation to the severity of acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). STUDY DESIGN: Of 72 women with acute PID verified and graded by laparoscopy and endometrial histopathology, 37 had mild PID and 35 had severe PID. Cervical, endometrial and tubal cultures were obtained for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, genital mycoplasmas, facultative and anaerobic bacteria and herpes simplex virus. RESULTS: C. trachomatis was the primary pathogenic agent in 44% of patients with acute PID. C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoea were as common in both severity groups, although C. trachomatis was isolated significantly more frequently from the fallopian tubes among cases with severe PID. Where aerobic or facultative bacteria other than C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae were concerned, Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae were the most important aerobic bacteria isolated from the fallopian tubes. Anaerobic bacteria were recovered from the fallopian tubes significantly more frequently in cases with severe PID than in those with mild PID, whereas their presence in the endometrium was not related to the severity of PID. CONCLUSIONS: The role of C. trachomatis as the leading cause of PID was confirmed in both laparoscopically mild and severe PID. Severe PID with abscess is invariably a polymicrobial infection with anaerobic bacteria involved, whereas their role in affecting the outcome of mild PID as well as the need of antianaerobic antimicrobial therapy in mild PID remains questionable.
TI  - [Clinical studies on cefozopran in pediatrics].
AB  - Cefozopran (CZOP) was administered via intravenous injection to 9 patients (ages  ranging from 1 month to 13 years) with pediatric bacterial infections, at daily dose levels between 56.7 and 200 mg/kg, divided into 3 or 4 doses. The following results were obtained. 1. Eight patients, including 1 with purulent meningitis, 1 with sepsis, 3 with acute pneumonia and 3 with lymphadenitis, were treated and subjected to clinical evaluation. Clinical effects were excellent in 6 cases and good in 2, with an overall efficacy rate of 100%. One case with pyoderma was not evaluated because of a combined use of an external antibiotic. 2. Organisms suspected as pathogens included 5 strains: 3 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 1 strain of Staphylococcus aureus and 1 of Escherichia coli. Bacteriologically, all the strains were eradicated. 3. Side effects or abnormal laboratory test results were observed in 4 cases; wheal in 1 case, elevated GOT and GPT in 2 cases and eosinophilia in 1 case. 4. From the results described above, we considered that CZOP would be an effective drug for use in pediatric bacterial infections.
TI  - Development of PCR assays to detect ampicillin resistance genes in cerebrospinal  fluid samples containing Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - We developed PCR primers specific for the blaTEM and blaROB ampicillin resistance genes. The specificity of the primers was confirmed by testing a series of Escherichia coli isolates containing a variety of ampicillin resistance genes and a series of ampicillin-resistant and ampicillin-susceptible Haemophilus influenzae isolates. There was a perfect correlation between ampicillin MICs, the presence of beta-lactamase (as determined by the nitrocefin test), and the results with the blaTEM and blaROB primers. Isolates of H. influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae obtained from 25 frozen cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens were also tested. Four of 14 H. influenzae isolates were positive with the blaTEM primers; none were positive with the blaROB primers. Ampicillin MICs were determined for the H. influenzae isolates, and penicillin MICs were determined for the S. pneumoniae isolates. Only the four PCR-positive H. influenzae isolates had elevated MICs of ampicillin and were beta-lactamase positive. None of the H. influenzae isolates contained the blaROB gene, and none of the S. pneumoniae isolates produced positive reactions with either primer set. We then used universal primers directed to conserved regions of rRNA and a Haemophilus detection probe to identify which of the 25 frozen samples of CSF contained H. influenzae. Fourteen of the 25 CSF specimens were positive for H. influenzae, which correlated with the number of organisms obtained by culture of the CSF samples. Four of the CSF samples were positive with the blaTEM primer set, and these correlated with the four H. influenzae isolates that were positive when tested directly by PCR. The blaTEM assay required the use of native Taq polymerase because Amplitaq preparations were contaminated with vector DNA that contained the blaTEM-1 gene.

TI  - [Epidemiology of primary bacterial meningitis].
AB  - In industrialized countries, the incidence of community-acquired bacterial meningitis is between 5 and 10 cases/10(5) population/year. The highest age-specific attack rates are recorded between 0 and 2 years of age and can reach 100 cases/10(5) population/year or more in some countries. In this range of age, Streptococcus agalactiae, Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli are responsible for meningitis in neonates whereas Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae cause meningitis in children older than 1 month. H. influenzae was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children but its incidence has declined since the introduction of routine childhood immunization with conjugate vaccines. N. meningitidis is the leading cause of meningitis in teenagers and young adults, whereas S. pneumoniae is responsible for most of meningitis in the elderly. Prognosis of bacterial meningitis mainly depends on the type of causative organism and on the age of onset. Detailed epidemiologic features of Haemophilus, meningococcal and pneumococcal meningitis are provided.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of new quinolones against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - In order to investigate antibacterial activities of new quinolones (NQs) against  a number of clinical isolates obtained in our laboratory during a period from February, 1993 to January, 1994, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using most of the NQs available in the market as of December, 1993. The obtained results are summarized as follows: 1. Noticeable differences were observed among the antibacterial activities of 8 different NQs tested against Gram-positive bacteria, i.e., there were large differences in their MIC distributions. Some differences were also observed among different NQs in ratios of NQ-resistant strains among Staphylococcus spp. From these results, it seems necessary to further study tolerance mechanisms of these Gram-positive bacteria toward different NQs and also to examine possible differences in antibacterial activities among different NQs against Gram-positive bacteria in clinical settings. 2. MIC distributions against Gram-negative bacteria were also different among the 8 NQs tested. Though elevated MICs were observed against NQ-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in many cases, and somewhat higher, though not exceedingly high, MIC values than those against NQ-sensitive bacteria were found in other cases, patterns of MIC values against different NQ-resistant Gram-negative bacteria were similar for all of the 8 NQs tested. This may explain the fact that most of NQ-resistant Gram-negative bacteria showed similar resistant patterns to the 8 NQs tested. 3. Among the NQ-resistant bacteria, were found Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains. Ratios of resistant strains were approximately 10% or lower for the former and approximately 20% for the latter. 4. With MICs of ampicillin and cefaclor used as control, it appears that benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive or PCG-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP or PRSP) and CEPs-resistant Escherichia coli are increasing.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of cefditoren against clinical isolates obtained from outpatients].
AB  - To examine the antimicrobial activity of cefditoren (CDTR) against strains clinically isolated from outpatients at this hospital from November, 1993 to February, 1994, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined including those of the control drugs. The results were as follows: 1. CDTR showed strong antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The MICs of CDTR against benzylpenicillin-insensitive or -resistant S. pneumoniae distributed in the lowest concentration range even compared to those of the control drugs. 2. CDTR showed strong antimicrobial activities against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella spp. The MIC of CDTR against CEPs-resistant E. coli was lower than those of most control drugs. 3. Since the microbes described above the major pathogens for the community-acquired infections, CDTR will be effective against infectious diseases transmitted at outpatient visits.

TI  - Binding of mannan-binding protein to various bacterial pathogens of meningitis.
AB  - Mannan-binding protein (MBP), a calcium-dependent plasma lectin, may play a role  in the innate defence against microorganisms. After binding to carbohydrate structures at the bacterial surface, MBP activates the classical pathway of the complement system. To investigate the binding capacity of MBP to various bacteria associated with meningitis, an assay was developed to study the binding of MBP to bacteria grown in a semisynthetic fluid culture medium. Salmonella montevideo (containing a mannose-rich lipopolysaccharide (LPS)), used as a positive control strain, showed binding of radiolabelled MBP at a level of 80% compared with binding of MBP to zymosan. Binding of labelled MBP to Salm. montevideo was time-dependent, temperature-dependent and saturable. The binding was inhibited by unlabelled MBP, by mannose and by N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. Among bacterial pathogens often found to cause meningitis, a wide range of MBP binding capacities could be determined. The encapsulated Neisseria meningitidis (representatives from 11 serogroups other than group A were included: n = 22), N. mucosa (n = 1), Haemophilus influenzae type b (n = 10) and Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 5) had a low MBP binding capacity of 21.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.3-40.1%). Escherichia coli K1 (n = 11), Strep. suis (n = 5), Strep. pneumoniae (n = 10) and N. meningitidis serogroup A (n = 2) showed intermediate MBP binding capacity of 58.4% (95% CI 40.0-76.8%). A third group consisting of non-encapsulated Listeria monocytogenes (n = 11), non-encapsulated H. influenzae (n = 2), non-encapsulated N. meningitidis (n = 2), N. cinera (n = 1) and N. subflava (n = 1) strains had a high MBP binding capacity of 87.5% (95% CI 62.5-112.5%). The majority of encapsulated pathogens causing bacterial meningitis seem to have a rather low MBP binding capacity.

TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activities of 3-thiazol-4-yl-1-carba-1-dethiacephalosporins.
AB  - The synthesis and microbiological evaluation of a new series of 3-thiazol-4-yl-carba-1-dethiacephalosporins is described. Structure activity relationship was achieved by changing substitution at the 2-position of the thiazole moiety. The result was a marked variance of microbiological activity in the C7 side-chain derivatives. ATMO derivatives possess potent activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. For example, MICs (microgram/ml) of LY215226 against representative organisms are as follows: S. aureus 0.25, S. pneumoniae 0.008, H. influenzae 0.008, E. coli 0.25, K. pneumoniae 0.008, E. cloacae 0.5, S. typhi 0.25, and M. morganii 0.25.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of FK-037, a new cephalosporin antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK-037, a novel parenteral oxime-type cephalosporin, was compared with that of cefepime, cefpirome, ceftazidime, imipenem, and gentamicin against a total of 668 recent clinical isolates. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure, and all isolates were tested at two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) colony forming units). FK-037 inhibited 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Providencia stuartii, Citrobacter freundii, Salmonella typhi, Shigella sonnei, Yersinia enterocolitica, Aeromonas species, and Haemophilus influenzae at < or = 1 microgram/ml. FK-037 was less active against Enterobacter species, Acinetobacter species, and Pseudomonas species, requiring 16 micrograms/ml to inhibit 90% of isolates, and was inactive against Xanthomonas maltophilia. FK-037 inhibited 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus at < or = 1 microgram/ml and 90% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus at < or = 8 micrograms/ml.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The aim of our study was to re-evaluate the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics against bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. The study drugs were cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cefixime, cefuroxime, cefetamet, cefprozil, and the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (= augmentin). In addition, cefotaxime as the standard agent of parenteral third generation cephalosporins was examined. The organisms tested were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, streptococci of serogroups C and G, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of the antimicrobials were determined with the agar dilution procedure. Cefpodoxime showed the broadest spectrum and generally also the highest activity of the oral beta-lactam antibiotics examined. The drug was equally active against the major groups of beta-lactamase negative and positive bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. Against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, all beta-lactam agents exhibited reduced activity comparable to the reduced activity of penicillin.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. SY5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Clostridium spp., and Bacteroides fragilis. Against Providencia spp., Proteus spp., and Haemophilus influenzae, SY5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. SY5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Enterococcus faecium, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. The bactericidal activities of SY5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the MICs for clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. SY5555 was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. However, SY5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by X. maltophilia (L-1) and P. aeruginosa/pMS354 beta-lactamases, two Bush group 3 beta-lactamases, SY5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from C. freundii GN7391 and E. cloacae GN7471 strains. These results suggest that SY5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Sequence of the rec-2 locus of Haemophilus influenzae: homologies to comE-ORF3 of Bacillus subtilis and msbA of Escherichia coli.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a 4243-bp PstI fragment containing the rec-2 gene of Haemophilus influenzae was determined. The amino acid (aa) sequences of four putative proteins were deduced from the corresponding open reading frames (ORFs). The 2400-bp ORF2 accounted for rec-2, based on the sequences of DNA fragments that contained rec-2::mini-Tn10 mutations. The rec-2 gene encoded a putative 800-aa protein with a M(r) of 90,561. Sequence analysis suggested that the rec-2 product contained nine highly probable integral membrane-spanning segments. Database searches showed that rec-2 was homologous to the comE-ORF3 gene of Bacillus subtilis. This hypothesis is consistent with the known involvement of both of these genes in the passage of transforming DNA through the competent-cell envelope. Although the sequences of the other three ORFs were incomplete, sufficient data were available to allow inferences about their homologies to other genes. ORF4, which overlapped ORF1, was homologous to the Escherichia coli dnaK suppressor gene, dksA, and therefore was named dsh-1 (dnaK suppressor homolog). Mutations in dsh-1 and its putative promoter region caused a mild sensitivity to UV light, but did not affect DNA recombination. ORF3, located downstream from rec-2, was homologous to msbA, an essential gene of E. coli with extensive similarity to the ATP-dependent translocators. ORF3 was named msh-1 (msbA homolog). Mutations in msh-1 had no effects on genetic transformation. The close juxtaposition of rec-2 and msh-1 implied that the expression of msh-1 could be linked to the translation of the rec-2 ORF.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the Haemophilus influenzae ssb gene encoding single-strand DNA-binding protein.
AB  - The ssb gene of Haemophilus influenzae was cloned and sequenced. The deduced protein possessed 61 and 60% identity with the Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli SSB proteins, respectively. H. influenzae ssb was also shown to complement an E. coli ssb-1 mutation.
TI  - Clinical usefulness of cerebrospinal fluid bacterial antigen studies.
AB  - A retrospective chart review was performed to evaluate the effect that positive results of cerebrospinal fluid bacterial antigen tests had on the care of patients with presumed bacterial meningitis. Of 901 tests ordered, costing $26,000 per year, 29 showed positive results--and only four of these affected patient care. By using cerebrospinal fluid bacterial antigen testing only when another test does not identify an organism, or in an attempt to determine central nervous system infection late in therapy for presumed sepsis, one can greatly reduce costs with no detrimental effect on patients.
TI  - Genes encoding high-molecular-weight adhesion proteins of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae are part of gene clusters.
AB  - We previously reported the cloning and sequencing of genes designated hmw1 and hmw2 from a prototype nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae strain. The genes encode proteins which are related to filamentous hemagglutinin of Bordetella pertussis and promote attachment of the nontypeable H. influenzae strain to human epithelial cells (J. W. St. Geme III, S. Falkow, and S. J. Barenkamp, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:2875-2879, 1993). Subcloning studies suggested that correct processing of these high-molecular-weight proteins required the products of additional downstream genes. In the present study we analyzed the 3'-flanking regions of the hmw1A and hmw2A structural genes and found that both genes are flanked by two additional downstream open reading frames (ORFs), designated B and C, respectively. The B ORFs are 1,635 bp long. Their derived amino acid sequences are 99% identical and demonstrate similarity to the derived amino acid sequences of two genes that encode proteins required for secretion and activation of hemolysins of Proteus mirabilis and Serratia marcescens. The C ORFs are 1,950 bp long, and their derived amino acid sequences are 96% identical. In Escherichia coli transformants, interruption of the hmw1C or both the hmw1B and hmw1C genes resulted in defective processing of the hmw1A structural gene product and loss of the ability of the transformants to adhere to human epithelial cells. The precise interactions of the proteins encoded by these gene clusters are yet to be defined, but their elucidation may further our understanding of the biology of nontypeable H. influenzae bacteria and the interaction of these organisms with the human host.
TI  - Identification of an HP1 phage protein required for site-specific excision.
AB  - Transposon insertion mutagenesis and transformation were used to locate genes responsible for excision in the temperature phage HP1 of Haemophilus influenzae. A 6.5 kb segment of DNA near the left end of the phage genome was sequenced, and 11 new open reading frames were identified. Two face-to-face overlapping promoter sequences organized these open reading frames into two operons transcribed in opposite directions. Interruption of the first open reading frame in the rightward operon created lysogens unable to produce phages. Provision of the uninterrupted open reading frame in trans restored phage production. The gene identified by this procedure, cox, was cloned and the protein product was expressed at high levels in Escherichia coli. The Cox protein is a 79-residue basic protein with a predicted strong helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif. Extracts induced to express high levels of Cox contained a 9 kDa protein. These extracts inhibited integrative recombination and were required for excisive recombination mediated by HP1 integrase. The HP1 cox gene location is similar to that of the homologous excisive and regulatory genes from coliphages P2 and 186. These phages appear to share a distinctive organization of recombination proteins and transcriptional domains differing markedly from phage lambda and its relatives.
TI  - The fimbrial gene cluster of Haemophilus influenzae type b.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae infections are preceded by airway colonization, a process  facilitated by fimbriae. Here, we identified the complete fimbrial gene cluster of H. influenzae type b. HifA forms the major subunit. HifB, a periplasmic chaperone, and HifC, an outer membrane usher, are typical assembly genes; their inactivation abolished fimbriae formation. HifD and HifE are putative minor subunits, both participating in fimbriae biogenesis. Inactivation of either one drastically reduced fimbriae expression. HifD represents a novel type of fimbrial subunit with lipoprotein characteristics, pointing to a membrane-associated function of HifD. Transcription of all fimbrial genes is coregulated through two clustered promoters. The flanking of the fimbrial gene cluster by repetitive extragenic palindromic sequences together with a partial duplication of an adjacent unrelated operon indicated that the cluster was once inserted in the H. influenzae genome as a mobile virulence unit.
TI  - Evaluation of minocycline and cefuzonam for antimicrobial activity against clinical isolates.
AB  - The Antibacterial activity of minocycline (MINO) and that of cefuzonam (CZON) were assessed with clinical isolates of 19 species, and compared with that of other antibiotics. MINO was highly active against methicilli-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Flavobacterium meningosepticum, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Propionibacterium acnes, but not as effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. CZON was highly active against MSSA, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, N. Gonorrhoeae, M(B). catarrhalis, H. influenzae, H. pylori, P. mirabilis, Peptostreptococcus spp. and P. acnes, but not effective against MRSA. It was minimally active against Gram-negative rods (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, etc.) and bacteria that do not ferment glucose.
TI  - Beta-lactamases: current situation and clinical importance.
AB  - Production of beta-lactamases is the most important means of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. The traditional, plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases were initially confined to Enterobacteriaceae but have now spread to other genera and species including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Extended-spectrum plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases have been identified in Enterobacteriaceae, particularly Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli. They are capable of hydrolyzing second- and third-generation cephalosporins and older beta-lactams. Chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases may be produced constitutively or induced by the presence of a beta-lactam. Mutation within the bacterial genome may lead to constitutive enzyme hyperproduction. Strains that produce these enzymes are resistant to practically all beta-lactams, with the exception of carbapenems. The wide-spread occurrence of antibiotic resistance dictates that therapies be judiciously chosen with attention to the resistance patterns of the causative organisms.
TI  - [Bacteriological and clinical studies of biapenem (L-627) in pediatric field].
AB  - We have carried out bacteriological and clinical studies on L-627. The results are summarized as follows. Treatment with L-627 was made in 14 cases of pediatric bacterial infections including 5 cases of pneumonia and 2 cases each of tonsillitis, urinary tract infection and one case each of colitis, and phlegmon. Results obtained were excellent in 11 cases, good in 2 cases and poor in one case. The bacteriological effect of L-627 was excellent, all causative organisms (Staphylococcus aureus one strain, Streptococcus pyogenes 2 strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae 3 strains, Escherichia coli 3 strains, Haemophilus influenzae one strain, Haemophilus parainfluenzae one strain) were eradicated. No significant side effects due to the drug were observed in any cases, except 2 cases each of elevated eosinophil counts and elevated platelet counts.
TI  - [Bacteriological and clinical studies of biapenem (L-627) in pediatrics].
AB  - Bacteriological and clinical studies in the pediatric field have been performed on biapenem (L-627), a newly-developed carbapenem antibiotic, and the following results were obtained. 1. In the pharmacokinetic study, the plasma concentration of L-627 showed dose-dependant change: Cmax was 14.6 micrograms/ml and AUC was 15.4 micrograms.hr/ml with the administration of 6 mg/kg, while Cmax was 49.2 micrograms/ml and AUC was 60.1 micrograms.hr/ml with the administration of 12 mg/kg. After the administration of 6 mg/kg, the urinary concentration reached maximum within 2 hours and the cumulative urinary excretion rate in the first 6 hours was 49.4%. 2. Antibacterial activities of L-627 against 27 strains of clinical isolates were determined. MICs of L-627 against such Gram-positive cocci as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were sufficiently low, and those against such Gram-negative rods as Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and Bordetella pertussis were satisfactory and as low as those of imipenem or ceftazidime. 3. Clinical efficacies of L-627 were evaluated in 36 cases of bacterial infections. The overall efficacy rate was 100%, and excellent responses in 26 cases and good in 10 cases were obtained. As for bacteriological efficacies, all strains except 1 of B. pertussis were eradicated and a high eradication rate of 96.6% was obtained. 4. No side effects were observed in 37 evaluated cases. As abnormal laboratory test results, eosinophilia was noted in 2 cases (5.4%), but they returned to normal values rapidly after the drug was discontinued. From these results, it has been concluded that L-627 is a safe and effective drug to be used in treatment of pediatric infectious diseases.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of a new carbapenem antibiotic, biapenem (L-627), in the pediatric field].
AB  - Biapenem (L-627) was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in 27 children with various bacterial infections. L-627 was effective in cases with osteomyelitis due to Staphylococcus aureus, pneumonia and purulent meningitis due to penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and urinary tract infections due to Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, L-627 failed to produce good responses in 2 of 7 cases of Haemophilus influenzae infections. Pharmacokinetic parameters of 30-minutes infusion of 12 mg/kg were as follows: Cmax 29-46 micrograms/ml, T 1/2 0.68-0.94 hr. Adverse reactions were minimal. These data suggest that L-627 is safe in children, and is valuable especially for treatment of infections in immunocompromised hosts and infections due to multiply resistant bacteria.
TI  - Production and immunochemical characterization of Neisseria meningitidis group B  antiserum for the diagnosis of purulent meningitis.
AB  - Unlike Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, Y and W135, the group B capsular polysaccharide has been shown to be chemically and immunologically identical to the capsular polysaccharide of Escherichia coli K1. Both components are sialic acid homopolymers and are poorly immunogenic. Nevertheless, due to the high incidence of Neisseria meningitidis group B meningitis in the population of the State of Sao Paulo, preparing antiserum to this serogroup for diagnostic purposes has become a matter of high priority. Of the many immunization schemes proposed, intravenous inoculation of whole bacteria previously inactivated with formaldehyde and simultaneous intradermal inoculation with a mixture of the bacterial polysaccharide fraction and whole bacteria in complete Freund;s adjuvant have produced the best results. The antiserum was treated with immunoadsorbents prepared with aluminum chloride and protein and/or polysaccharide antigens from each of the following heterologous bacteria: Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli other than K1, and Staphylococcus aureus, in order to eliminate cross-reactivity. For quality control analysis, the antiserum was assessed by the immunodiffusion, counterimmunoelectrophoresis, dot-ELISA, and immuno-blot techniques against homologous antigens. Specificity was obtained after treating the antiserum with Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide immunosorbent.
TI  - The effects of nonclassic pediatric bacterial pathogens on the usefulness of the  Directigen latex agglutination test.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae type b, Escherichia coli, Neisseria meningitis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae are classically the predominant meningeal pathogens of children. The Directigen latex agglutination test identifies these pathogens by detecting specific antigens in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and urine. The authors tested 1151 specimens from 791 children with suspected meningeal infections. They found that the sensitivity of the Directigen test for detecting the five classic CSF pathogens of children was 83.3% with CSF and 60% with urine specimens. In detecting all pathogens, however, the sensitivity was only 50% with CSF and 37.5% with urine. Thus, an increased prevalence of nonclassic pathogens in a pediatric population adversely affects the efficacy of the Directigen test for confirming a diagnosis of meningitis and emphasizes the diagnostic importance of the clinical history and other routine CSF tests.
TI  - Lactoferrin is a lipid A-binding protein.
AB  - Lactoferrin (LF), a cationic 80-kDa protein present in polymorphonuclear leukocytes and in mucosal secretions, is known to have antibacterial effects on gram-negative bacteria, with a concomitant release of lipopolysaccharides (LPS, endotoxin). In addition, LF is known to decrease LPS-induced cytokine release by monocytes and LPS priming of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Its mechanism of action is incompletely understood. We have now demonstrated by in vitro-binding studies that LF binds directly to isolated lipid A and intact LPS of clinically relevant serotypes of the species which most frequently cause bacteremia (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), as well as to lipid A and LPS of mucosal pathogens (among others, Neisseria meningitides and Haemophilus influenzae). Binding to LPS was inhibitable by lipid A and polymyxin B but not by KDO (3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate), a glycoside residue present in the inner core of LPS. Binding of LF to lipid A was saturable, and an affinity constant of 2 x 10(9) M-1 was calculated for the LF-lipid A interaction. Our data may explain, in part, the mechanism whereby LF exerts its antibacterial and anti-endotoxic effects. Further studies on the ability of LF to block the detrimental effects of LPS, both in vitro and in vivo, are warranted.
TI  - A functional tonB gene is required for both utilization of heme and virulence expression by Haemophilus influenzae type b.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae is nearly unique among facultatively anaerobic bacteria in its absolute requirement for exogenously supplied heme for aerobic growth. In this study, a mutant analysis strategy was used to facilitate identification of H. influenzae cell envelope components involved in the uptake of heme. Chemical mutagenesis was employed to produce a mutant of a nontypeable H. influenzae strain unable to utilize either protein-bound forms of heme or low levels of free heme. This mutant was transformed with a plasmid shuttle vector-based genomic library constructed from the same wild-type nontypeable H. influenzae strain, and a growth selection technique was used to obtain a recombinant clone that could utilize heme. Analysis of the DNA insert in the recombinant plasmid revealed the presence of several open reading frames, one of which encoded a 28-kDa protein with significant similarity to the TonB protein of Escherichia coli. This H. influenzae gene product was able to complement a tonB mutation in E. coli, allowing the E. coli tonB mutant to form single colonies on minimal medium containing vitamin B12. When this H. influenzae gene was inactivated by insertional mutagenesis techniques and introduced into the chromosome of wild-type strains of H. influenzae type b, the resultant transformants lost their abilities to utilize heme and produce invasive disease in an animal model. Genetic restoration of the ability to express this TonB homolog resulted in the simultaneous acquisition of both heme utilization ability and virulence. These results indicate that the H. influenzae TonB protein is required not only for heme utilization by this pathogen in vitro, but also for virulence of H. influenzae type b in an animal model.
TI  - Piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections: an open non-comparative and multicentered trial. Latin American Clinical Research Group.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the clinical and bacteriological efficacy  and safety of piperacillin-tazobactam (PT) (4g/500 mg IV tid) in the treatment of 107 adult patients with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) requiring hospitalization. Patients included were 66 men and 41 women with a mean age of 55.2 years (range 18-89), enrolled from Mexican (6) and Argentinean (5) hospitals. Ninety-nine clinically evaluable patients (92.5%), 87 with pneumonia and 12 with bronchitis, were treated for a mean period of 9.3 and 7.3 days, respectively. Response to treatment was favorable in 94.3% cases with pneumonia and 100% of cases with bronchitis; 86 cases (80.3%) were bacteriologically evaluable, 77 with pneumonia (eradication 74, persistence 1, superinfection 2), and 9 with bronchitis (eradication in all). Streptococcus pneumoniae was recovered in 24, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 21, Staphylococcus aureus in 8, Haemophilus influenzae in 7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 5, Enterobacter spp. in 6, Escherichia coli in 6 and other organisms in 12. Toxicity or intolerance were not observed. Our data suggest that PT is a reliable therapy for severe LRTI.
TI  - Binding of human hemoglobin by Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Binding of biotinylated human hemoglobin to Haemophilus influenzae was detected when organisms were grown in heme-deplete, but not heme-replete, conditions. Hemoglobin binding was completely inhibited by a 100-fold excess of unlabelled human hemoglobin or human hemoglobin complexed with human haptoglobin. Binding was only partially inhibited by rat hemoglobin, bovine hemoglobin, human globin, and bovine globin, and not at all by heme, human serum albumin, bovine serum albumin, human transferrin, or myoglobin. Hemoglobin binding was saturable at 16-20 ng of hemoglobin per 10(9) cfu. Binding of human hemoglobin was detected in serotypes a-f and serologically non-typable strains of H. influenzae, as well as Haemophilus haemolyticus but not Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Haemophilus parahaemolyticus, or Escherichia coli.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. The advantages of in vitro activity of FK037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (MIC90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (H-MRSA), (3) a strong activity against Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (MIC90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, 0.1 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for Haemophilus influenzae and Proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for C. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant S. aureus (L-MRSA), Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for H-MRSA and Serratia marcescens. FK037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except MRSA, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except P. vulgaris and/or M. catarrhalis. The increase in MICs of FK037 against 2 L-MRSA strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. FK037 was highly bactericidal against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa at the MIC or higher. FK037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. Its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against H-MRSA and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Against the other strains, FK037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against P. aeruginosa. Transmission electron microscopic studies revealed that FK037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in MRSA after 4 h incubation.
TI  - A peroxide/ascorbate-inducible catalase from Haemophilus influenzae is homologous to the Escherichia coli katE gene product.
AB  - Bacterial catalases are induced by exposure to peroxide (e.g., Escherichia coli katG) or entry into stationary phase (e.g., E. coli katE). To study regulatory systems in Haemophilus influenzae, we complemented an E. coli rpoS mutant, which is unable to induce katE in stationary phase, with a plasmid library of H. influenzae Rd- chromosomal DNA. Nineteen complementing clones with a catalase-positive phenotype were obtained and characterized after screening about 10(5) transformants. All carried the same structural gene for an H. influenzae catalase. The DNA sequence of this gene, called hktE, encodes a 508-amino-acid polypeptide with strong homology to eukaryotic catalases and E. coli katE. However, hktE is regulated like E. coli katG, with catalase activity increasing 10-fold and hktE mRNA levels increasing 4-fold upon exposure to ascorbic acid, which serves to generate hydrogen peroxide. Mutations in the known global regulatory genes of H. influenzae--crp, cya, and sxy--do not affect the inducibility of hktE. The hktE gene maps to a 225-kb segment of the H. influenzae chromosome in a region encoding resistance to spectinomycin.
TI  - Variable region sequences and idiotypic expression of a protective human immunoglobulin M antibody to capsular polysaccharides of Neisseria meningitidis group B and Escherichia coli K1.
AB  - We determined the heavy (H)- and light (L)-chain variable (V) region nucleotide and translated amino acid sequences of the human immunoglobulin M(kappa) monoclonal antibody (MAb) 5E1, which is specific for the polysaccharide capsule of Escherichia coli K1 and Neisseria meningitidis group B (poly[alpha(2-->8)-N-acetylneuraminic acid]) and which is protective in animal models of infection. The 5E1 VH gene is a member of the VHIIIb family and is 97% homologous to the 9.1 germ line gene. The 5E1 VL gene is a member of the kappa I subgroup and is 98% homologous to the germ line gene, 15A, also known as KLO12. The VL and/or VH genes used by 5E1 are highly homologous to the V genes encoding antibodies to the Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide and to antibodies reactive with self-antigens such as erythrocyte "i," DNA, and thyroid peroxidase. We also produced three murine anti-idiotype (Id) MAbs against 5E1. All three anti-Ids recognize a minor subset of antimeningococcal B polysaccharide antibodies present in serum from normal adults. Two of the anti-Ids define distinct Ids associated with antibodies having kappa I-15A V regions. These 15A-associated Ids are expressed by some heterologous human antimeningococcal B polysaccharide MAbs, and they also are independently expressed by two human MAbs that are specific for either the H. influenzae b polysaccharide or the i erythrocyte antigen and that utilize the kappa I-15A V region. Taken together, these data indicate that the 5E1 antibody uses V regions that recur in the human antibody repertoires to this polysaccharide and to structurally dissimilar polysaccharides and autoantigens. Thus, the poor immunogenicity of poly[alpha(2-->8)-N-acetylneuraminic acid] cannot be explained by the unavailability of certain critical VH and VL genes required for generation of antibody response.
TI  - [Bacterial meningitis. Review of literature and retrospective study of 208 cases  observed].
AB  - Bacterial meningitis is a particularly dangerous infection of the central nervous system involving quite a number of mortal cases and frequent neurological sequelae. Etiology varies in relation to the patient's age. In the first 2 months of life Streptococcus B, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli and other Gram negative enteric bacilli are more frequently isolated while in older children Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae are more common. Clinical symptoms take a different form according to the patient's age: symptoms of a general kind prevail in the first 2 months of life while in older children signs of meningeal irritation predominate. In a review of the survey of cases of bacterial meningitis observed at the Clinica Pediatrica in Pisa from 1970 to July 1993, with a retrospective research, 208 patients have been examined, considering age, etiology, clinical course especially observing the course of temperature, liquor characteristics, normalisation of the index of phlogosis, mortality and neurological sequelae. In the last ten years the availability of 3rd generation cephalosporin has provided the possibility of comparing two groups of patients of an age ranging between 1 month and 14 years. Twenty cases were treated with ampicillin and chloramphenicol and 30 cases with cephalosporins the evaluation made considering the course of temperature, the normalization of the liquor index has revealed a more favourable clinical course in the second group of patients.
TI  - Use of biotinylated beta-lactams and chemiluminescence for study and purification of penicillin-binding proteins in bacteria.
AB  - A new reagent for the detection of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) was developed. An N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of biotin was used to tag beta-lactam antibiotics with free side chain amino groups such as ampicillin (BIO-AMP), 6-aminopenicillanic acid (BIO-APA), and 7-aminocephalosporanic acid (BIO-ACA). Bacterial PBPs from cells or isolated cytoplasmic membranes of Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were labeled with BIO-AMP, subjected to electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Electrophoretic PBP profiles were detected on blots, using colorimetric or chemiluminescence systems, on the basis of the interaction of BIO-AMP-PBP complexes and a streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate. The chemiluminescent reaction permitted a high sensitivity of detection, and PBP profiles could be determined within seconds. All PBP profiles were similar to those obtained with a traditional PBP labeling technique with 125I-labeled penicillin V, except that an additional unidentified PBP (approximately 55,000 Da) was labeled with BIO-AMP in E. coli and H. influenzae. Differences in the intensities of labeling for specific PBPs were observed between the chemiluminescent and radioactive labeling agents and were attributed to the differences in their affinities for PBPs. Similarly, BIO-AMP, BIO-APA, and BIO-ACA produced different PBP profiles. We also investigated the use of BIO-AMP in PBP purification. BIO-AMP-PBP complexes from a mixture of H. influenzae proteins were allowed to bind to avidin immobilized on an agarose support in a microcentrifuge tube. After several washes in the presence of salts, PBPs were eluted by boiling and treatment with SDS. The eluted proteins were separated by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and biotinylated proteins were identified on blots by a chemiluminescence reaction. Biotinylation of beta-lactams is rapid, safe, and inexpensive. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using biotinylated beta-lactams as nonradioactive reagents for the study of PBPs and for the purification of these proteins.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of aztreonam against clinical isolates].
AB  - To evaluate the antibacterial activity of a monobactam antibiotic, aztreonam (AZT), MICs of AZT and other antibiotics against clinical isolates collected at 36 participating institutions after January 1992 were determined using the agar plate dilution method (size of inoculum, 10(6) cfu/ml) according to the Japan Society of Chemotherapy standard. The antibiotics that were tested along with AZT included piperacillin (PIPC), cefoperazone (CPZ), and amikacin (AMK). AZT was found to be more active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Providencia rettgeri than CPZ, PIPC, and AMK. AZT was also more active against Serratia marcescens than the other antibiotics, but about 6% of the strains tested were resistant to AZT with MIC of 12.5 micrograms/ml. Against Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii, however, was more active AMK than AZT. AZT showed a normal activity distribution with a single peak at the MIC of 3.13-6.25 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 35% of inoculum was resistant with high MIC values (MIC > or = 25 micrograms/ml). Activities of AZT against Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were comparable to those of CPZ.
TI  - Minimum inhibitory concentration quality-control guidelines for biapenem, DU-6859a, FK-037, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, and ceftizoxime when using various National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards susceptibility test methods. Quality Control Study Group.
AB  - Several multilaboratory collaborative studies using broth microdilution and agar  dilution (gonococcal tests only) methods of susceptibility testing were performed to establish quality-control (QC) giudelines. Replicate dilution tests with multiple lots of media were performed with National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards recommended QC strains (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213) by using the following antimicrobials: biapenem, DU-6859a, FK-037, levofloxacin, and grepafloxacin. In addition QC MIC ranges, using appropriate medium modification for Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247 and Neisseria gonorrhoeae ATCC 49226 were reported on four (DU-6859a, FK-037, levofloxacin, and grepafloxacin) and two (ceftizoxime and FK-037) antimicrobials, respectively.
TI  - Inhibition of fungal growth by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas cepacia isolated from patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - This study was undertaken because of the infrequency of infections due to Candida species in patients with cystic fibrosis despite their extensive treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. In vitro susceptibility studies revealed significant inhibition of 11 strains of fungi known to infect human beings by 10 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and nine strains of Pseudomonas cepacia isolated from the sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis. The fungi were Candida krusei, Candida keyfr, Candida guillermondii, Candida tropicalis, Candida lusitaniae, Candida parapsilosis, Candida pseudotropicalis, Candida albicans, Torulopsis glabrata, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus fumigatus. Inhibition of fungal growth by Escherichia coli (NCTC 10418), Staphylococcus aureus (NCTC 6571) and Haemophilus influenzae (NCTC 11931) could not be demonstrated. The continued presence in the sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis of strains of P. aeruginosa and P. cepacia, which produce antifungal substances, may inhibit growth of Candida species and so prevent overt Candida infections. A. fumigatus would seem to be the most important fungus causing disease in patients with cystic fibrosis. It is therefore interesting to note that this was the most resistant of all the fungi tested for inhibition by P. aeruginosa and P. cepacia.
TI  - Divergence of genetic sequences for the vacuolating cytotoxin among Helicobacter  pylori strains.
AB  - Approximately 50% of Helicobacter pylori isolates produce a cytotoxin in vitro that induces vacuolation of eukaryotic cells. Screening a lambda ZapII library of H. pylori 60190 chromosomal fragments permitted the identification of a 3864-base pair (bp) open reading frame (vacA) that encoded the vacuolating cytotoxin, and a > or = 567-bp upstream gene that was homologous to Escherichia coli cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase. The sequence data suggest that a 33-amino-acid leader sequence and a C-terminal peptide are cleaved from a 139-kDa protoxin to yield the mature 87-kDa cytotoxin. The vacA gene product contains a C-terminal motif that is present in several other bacterial proteins that undergo C-terminal cleavage, including IgA proteases of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Isogenic H. pylori mutants with insertional mutation of the vacA gene lacked vacuolating cytotoxin activity and failed to produce the 87-kDa protein. Southern analysis of naturally occurring tox-H. pylori strains with vacA probes indicated the presence of hybridizing bands, but both Southern analysis and polymerase chain reaction studies suggested that the vacA sequences of tox- strains differed from those of tox+ strains. Sequence analysis of a 1541-bp region of polymerase chain reaction-amplified vacA from tox- strain 87-203 indicated 64.8% amino acid identity with the corresponding region from tox+ strain 60190. Thus, sequence divergence in vacA genes may explain the lack of functionally active cytotoxin production by some H. pylori isolates.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on cefditoren pivoxil in pediatric field].
AB  - Cefditoren pivoxil (CDTR-PI, ME1207) granules, a new oral cephem, was given to pediatric patients with infectious diseases to evaluate antibacterial activities against clinical isolates, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and safety, and the following results were obtained. 1. In sensitivity test, 30 strains were used comprised of 5 species, isolated from the patients before administered with CDTR-PI. Against Staphylococcus aureus, MICs of 7 agents, cefditoren (CDTR), cefaclor, cefixime, cefteram, cefotiam, cefpodoxime and methicillin, were determined. Against other 4 species, MICs of the above 6 agents excluding methicillin were determined. Among Gram-positive cocci tested, the MICs of CDTR were 0.78 to 100 micrograms/ml or higher against S. aureus (16 strains), < or = 0.025 microgram/ml against Streptococcus pyogenes (5 strains), and 0.10 or 0.39 microgram/ml against Streptococcus pneumoniae (2 strains). These values were equal to or lower than those of conventional cephems and of methicillin. Among Gram-negative rods tested, the MICs of CDTR were < or = 0.025 microgram/ml against Haemophilus influenzae (3 strains), and 0.10 or 0.20 microgram/ml against Escherichia coli (4 strains). Also, these values were equal to or lower than those of conventional cephems. 2. When CDTR-PI granules was orally administered in a single dose of 3.0 mg/kg to 1 patient and that of 6.0 mg/kg to 2 patients 30 minutes after meal, plasma CDTR concentrations reached their maxima 4 hours after administration in the former patient and 1 or 2 hours after administration in the latter 2 patients, and the peak plasma concentrations were 1.91, 3.46 and 4.82 micrograms/ml with half-lives of 1.01, 0.81 and 0.88 hours and AUCs of 8.62, 9.89 and 13.52 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. Dose-dependency was observed for the peak plasma concentrations and AUCs also tended to depend on dose excepting for the AUC in one 6.0 mg/kg patient. 3. The urinary concentrations in the above patients reached their peaks at 4 to 6 hours after administration in one 3.0 mg/kg patient and at 4 to 6 hours and 2 to 4 hours after administration in two 6.0 mg/kg patients, and the corresponding values were 126.0, 195.0 and 234.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. Recovery rates in the first 8 hours after administration were 18.2, 24.6 and 21.3%, respectively. 4. Of 53 patients with 13 diseases, CDTR-PI was clinically judged "excellent" in 32 (60.4%) and "good" in 21 (39.6%), showing excellent efficacy. 5. Bacteriologically, excellent results were obtained, i.e., 29 (96.7%) of 30 strains from 5 species were eradicated. 6. Side effects were observed in none of the 54 patients treated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of cefuroxime against recent clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of cefuroxime axetil (CXM-AX) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains obtained mainly from outpatients of our center in a period from January to September of 1990 and 1993. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined and the following results were obtained. 1. The results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, MIC80 of CXM were equal to or lower against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Peptostreptococcus spp., and Propionibacterium acnes, except for Streptococcus pneumoniae, MIC80 which was slightly higher. 2. MIC90 of comparator drugs reflected those of new resistant organisms recently appeared, such as benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP), cephem-resistant E. coli and Klebsiella spp., new quinolone-resistant H. influenzae and N. gonorrhoeae. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was detected also from specimens of community acquired infections. From the nature of MRSA detected in those situations MRSA appeared to present a continuing problem. 3. MIC90 against strains obtained from patients with community acquired infections was a good index of increases of multidrug-resistant organisms in the past. Therefore, the determination of MIC90 is important in examining changes with time of sensitivities or resistances of clinically isolated strains to antimicrobial drugs. 4. Antimicrobial activities of CXM against recent clinical isolates showed the existence of problems as mentioned above. However, MIC of CXM as well as those of comparator drugs indicated that antimicrobial activities of CXM against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., H. influenzae appeared to be relatively strong, and it is concluded that cefuroxime axetil still is one of the clinically useful oral antimicrobial drugs in the 1990's.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a gene involved in hemagglutination by an avian pathogenic Escherichia coli strain.
AB  - In this article, we report the isolation and characterization of a gene that may  be important in the adherence of avian pathogenic Escherichia coli to the avian respiratory tract. The E. coli strain HB101, which is unable to agglutinate chicken erythrocytes, was transduced with cosmid libraries from the avian pathogenic E. coli strain chi 7122. Enrichment of transductants that could agglutinate chicken erythrocytes yielded 19 colonies. These isolates contained cosmids that encompassed four nonoverlapping regions of the E. coli chromosome. Only one group of cosmids, represented by pYA3104, would cause E. coli CC118 to agglutinate chicken erythrocytes. A 10-kb fragment of this cosmid was subcloned in pACYC184. Transposon mutagenesis of this fragment with Tn5seq1 indicated that a contiguous 4.4-kb region of cloned DNA was required for hemagglutination. In vitro transcription/translation assays indicated that this 4.4-kb region of DNA encoded one protein of approximately 140 kDa. The nucleotide sequence of this region was determined and found to encode one open reading frame of 4,134 nucleotides that would encode a protein of 1,377 amino acids with a deduced molecular weight of 148,226. This gene confers on E. coli K-12 a temperature-sensitive hemagglutination phenotype that is best expressed when cells are grown at 26 degrees C, and we have designated this gene tsh and the deduced gene product Tsh. Insertional mutagenesis of the chromosomal tsh gene in chi 7122 had no effect on hemagglutination titers. The deduced protein was found to contain significant homology to the Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae immunoglobulin A1 proteases. These data indicate that (i) a single gene isolated from the avian pathogenic E. coli strain chi 7122 will confer on E. coli K-12 a hemagglutination-positive phenotype, (ii) chi 7122 contains at least two distinct mechanisms to allow hemagglutination to occur, and (iii) the hemagglutinin Tsh has homology with a class of proteins previously not known to exist in E. coli.
TI  - Randomized comparative trial with ampicillin/sulbactam versus cefamandole in the  therapy of community acquired pneumonia.
AB  - In a randomized prospective study ampicillin/sulbactam and cefamandole were compared in the therapy of patients hospitalized with community acquired pneumonia. Patients receiving ampicillin/sulbactam (n = 37) and cefamandole (n = 38) were similar with respect to age (mean age 70 vs. 76 years respectively), clinical characteristics, severity of illness and underlying disease. Pathogens isolated from patients in the cefamandole and ampicillin/sulbactam group, respectively, were Streptococcus pneumoniae (7 vs. 7 patients), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (7 vs. 6 patients), Haemophilus influenzae (5 vs. 5 patients), Staphylococcus aureus (5 vs. 4 patients), Escherichia coli (4 vs. 4 patients), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3 vs. 3 patients), Enterobacter spp. (2 vs. 3 patients), Moraxella catarrhalis (1 vs. 2 patients), and organisms of the oral flora (4 vs. 3 patients). The rate of resistance to penicillin was 80%, to clindamycin 76%, to erythromycin 45%, to ampicillin 43%, and to cefazolin 18%. Overall successful treatment rates of 81% for cefamandole and 97% for ampicillin/sulbactam (p = 0.05) were observed. Both cefamandole and ampicillin/sulbactam were shown to be effective agents for therapy of community acquired pneumonia; however ampicillin/sulbactam demonstrated superior overall clinical efficacy.
TI  - Cefuroxime axetil.
AB  - Cefuroxime is the first commercially-available second-generation cephalosporine to be widely used in therapy; it is a semi-synthetic cephalosporin obtained from the 7-cephalosporanic acid nucleus of cephalosporin C. Cefuroxime axetil is the acetoxyethyl ester of cefuroxime. The majority of micro-organisms associated with respiratory infections are highly sensitive to cefuroxime. These include Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and the other streptococci (excluding group D streptococci), and Moraxella catarrhalis. Bacteria sensitive to cefuroxime include the enterobacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella and Shigella and Straphylococcus aureus (methicillin-sensitive strains). The pharmacokinetic studies show that the maximum plasma concentration of cefuroxime after oral administration of 250 mg and 500 mg of cefuroxime axetil after a meal are respectively 4.6 and 7.9 mg/l. The absolute bioavailability of tablets is 68% (extremes 63-73%) after oral administration of 500 mg cefuroxime axetil. The protein binding is 33+/-5.7%. Tissue diffusion was studied in the interstitial fluid, the bronchial mucosa, the tonsils, and the bronchial secretions. Cefuroxime axetil is available as capsule-shaped tablets containing 125, 250 or 500 mg. An oral suspension dosage form for paediatric purposes is also available as granules in multidose bottles and sachets. Constitution gives a suspension containing 125 mg or 250 mg cefuroxime (as cefuroxime axetil). Cefuroxime axetil is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible bacteria. Indications include: lower respiratory tract infections (e.g., acute and chronic bronchitis and pneumonia); upper respiratory tract infections (e.g., ear, nose and throat infections such as otitis media, sinusitis tonsillitis and pharyngitis); genito-urinary tract infections (e.g., pyelonephritis, cystitis and urethritis, gonorrhoea, acute uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis); and skin and soft tissue infections (e.g., furunculosis, pyoderma and impetigo). For most infections, a dose of 250 mg twice daily is appropriate. In some urinary tract infections, 125 mg twice daily has been shown to be effective. If pneumonia is suspected or in more severe lower respiratory tract infection, doses of 500 mg bd should be used. Uncomplicated gonorrhoea has been shown to respond to a single 1-g dose of cefuroxime axetil. Adverse reactions to cefuroxime have generally been mild and transient in nature (gastrointestinal disturbances, including diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting).
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial isolates in south Sweden including a 13-year follow-up study of some respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - The antibiotic susceptibility of consecutive isolates of the upper respiratory tract pathogens Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, (100 strains of each species collected each year during March through April 1985, 1988 and 1992) to penicillin V, amoxycillin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, doxycycline, erythromycin, and cotrimoxazole was investigated by MIC determination on PDM and PDM II agar. The MICs of the upper respiratory isolates from 1992 supplemented with 100 isolates each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus collected during 1992 were determined against the above antibiotics plus cefadroxil, cefpodoxime, roxithromycin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and BAY Y 3118. Beta-lactamase production was found in 10% of H. influenzae and 80-90% of S. aureus and B. catarrhalis in 1992. Among H. influenzae isolates, non-beta-lactamase-induced resistance to all beta-lactam antibiotics was first detected in 1988 and amounted to 3% of isolates in 1992. Decreased susceptibility of S. preumoniae to penicillin (> or = 0.12 mg/l), co-trimoxazole > or = 32 mg/l, doxycycline (> or = 2 ml/l) and erythromycin (> or = 1 mg/l) was detected in 11%, 7%, and 8%, respectively, in 1992, which is significantly higher than in previous years at the same laboratory. Decreased susceptibility of S. pyogenes to doxycycline and erythromycin was detected in 11% and 9% in 1992. The two most recently developed antibiotics, cefpodoxime and BAY Y 3118, showed high antibacterial activity. The study emphasizes the need to screen for resistance mechanisms such as beta-lactamase production and lowered penicillin affinity.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefdinir (FK482) and ten other antibiotics against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from adult and pediatric patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefdinir, an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin was compared with that of cefixime, cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, oxacillin, ampicillin, vancomycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against 279 gram-positive and gram-negative recent clinical isolates from adult and pediatric patients. Cefdinir was the most active drug among the cephalosporins against oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90 0.015-2 mg/l). Cefixime was the most active agent against Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris (MIC90 < 0.015-0.125 mg/l). The activity of cefpodoxime was better than that of cefixime against S. pneumoniae and oxacillin-sensitive staphylococci (MIC90 0.25-8 vs. 0.5-32 mg/l), similar to cefixime against S. pyogenes (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) and not as good as cefixime against H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus spp. (MIC90 < 0.015-0.25 vs. 0.125-0.5 mg/l). The activity of cefdinir was greater than that of the other cephalosporins against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 16-32 vs. > 64 mg/l). None of the cephalosporins were active against methicillin-resistant, coagulase-positive or -negative staphylococci or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 > 64 mg/l). Overall, the susceptibilities of adult and pediatric isolates were similar. Kinetic kill curves demonstrated rapid and similar killing at 6 h by cefdinir, cefixime, cefpodoxime and ofloxacin. At 24 h at 1 x MIC, the least regrowth was observed with cefdinir and cefpodoxime; at 2 x MIC, suppression of growth was similar with all four drugs.
TI  - Human serum IgA downregulates the release of inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6) in human monocytes.
AB  - While the protective effect of IgA antibodies against infection of the mucosal surfaces is well documented, the mechanisms involved are not entirely clear. The aim of the current study is to investigate the effect of human serum IgA on the release of inflammatory cytokines in human monocytes activated with a particulate stimulus, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), or soluble lipopolysaccharide (LPS) purified from Escherichia coli. Our results show that IgA downregulates tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production, whereas IgG examined in parallel had no effect. IgA had no inhibitory effect on Hib-induced granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor release. TNF-alpha and IL-6 release were downmodulated if IgA was present during cytokine induction, and IgA was also inhibitory if added to Hib-pretreated monocytes during the phase of cytokine release. These findings indicate that there are at least two mechanisms whereby IgA antibodies can downregulate TNF-alpha and IL-6 release in human monocytes: by a mechanism acting during the time of monocyte activation, and a mechanism that downregulates the production and/or the release of these cytokines in activated monocytes. Regulation of TNF-alpha and IL-6 release by IgA may be among the antiinflammatory mechanisms preventing an uncontrolled release of potentially noxious levels of inflammatory cytokines during acute and/or chronic inflammation.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the Treponema pallidum tpn50 gene, an ompA homolog.
AB  - Treponema pallidum is a pathogenic spirochete that has no known genetic exchange  mechanisms. In order to identify treponemal genes encoding surface and secreted proteins, we carried out TnphoA mutagenesis of a T. pallidum genomic DNA library in Escherichia coli. Several of the resulting clones expressed enzymatically active T. pallidum-alkaline phosphatase fusion proteins. The DNA sequence of the 5' portion of a number of the treponemal genes was obtained and analyzed. A recombinant clone harboring plasmid p4A2 that encoded a treponemal protein with an approximate molecular mass of 50,000 Da was identified. Plasmid p4A2 contained an open reading frame of 1,251 nucleotides that resulted in a predicted protein of 417 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 47,582 Da. We have named this gene tpn50 in accordance with the current nomenclature for T. pallidum genes. A 1.9-kb HincII-ClaI fragment from p4A2 that contained the tpn50 gene was subcloned to produce p4A2HC2. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of TpN50 with protein sequences in the National Center for Biotechnology Information data base indicated statistically significant homology to the Pseudomonas sp. OprF, E. coli OmpA, Bordetella avium OmpA, Neisseria meningitidis RmpM, Neisseria gonorrhoeae PIII, Haemophilus influenzae P6, E. coli PAL, and Legionella pneumophila PAL proteins. These proteins are all members of a family of outer membrane proteins that are present in gram-negative bacteria. The tpn50 gene complemented E. coli ompA mutations on the basis of two separate criteria. First, morphometry and electron microscopy data showed that E. coli C386 (ompA lpp) cells harboring plasmid vector pEBH21 were rounded while cells of the same strain harboring p4A2HC2 (TpN50+), pWW2200 (OprF+), or pRD87 (OmpA+) were rod shaped. Second, E. coli BRE51 (MC4100 delta sulA-ompA) cells harboring pEBH21 grew poorly at 42 degrees C in minimal medium, while the growth of BRE51 cells harboring p4A2HC2 was similar to that of the parental MC4100 cells. These results demonstrate that the TpN50 protein is functionally equivalent to the E. coli OmpA protein. If TpN50 functions in a similar fashion in T. pallidum, then it may be localized to the treponemal outer membrane.
TI  - In-vitro evaluation of cefpodoxime.
AB  - In-vitro antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was evaluated against several microbial species by both conventional tests and additional parameters which take into consideration some of the conditions likely to be encountered in infected tissues. MICs for 414 recent clinical isolates, including staphylococci, streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, several Enterobacteriaceae, Aeromonas hydrophila and Campylobacter jejuni were determined. MIC values overall were similar to those observed for strains from other geographical areas. Inhibition of growth by cefpodoxime was virtually unaffected by the inoculum size, even using bacterial populations as large as 10(9) cfu of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenzae, beta-lactamase-negative M. catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Growth in the presence of human serum as the only source of nutrients did not significantly affect the inhibition exerted by cefpodoxime, even against large bacterial populations of S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae. For K. pneumoniae, E. coli, P. mirabilis and beta-lactamase-negative M. catarrhalis it was also found that sub-MIC concentrations of cefpodoxime were still able to inhibit the majority of cells in microbial populations as large as 10(9) cfu. Evaluation of bactericidal activity demonstrated that cefpodoxime concentrations comparable to those achievable in plasma or in the respiratory tract were able to kill rapidly large bacterial populations of S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. The bactericidal activity was apparently lower against M. catarrhalis, H. influenzae, S. aureus, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in children: etiology and clinical features, an 11-year review of 618 cases.
AB  - During the period January 1980 to December 1990 (11 years) a retrospective study  of patients with bacterial meningitis who were admitted to Bangkok Children's Hospital was carried out. There were 618 patients with 77 cases (12.5%) occurring below the age of one month (neonatal meningitis), and 541 cases (87.5%) between one month to 15 years (childhood meningitis). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common pathogenic organism (16.9%) in neonatal meningitis; other causative agents in this age group included Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.0%), group B Streptococcus (11.7%), Escherichia coli and Enterobacter sp (10.4% each). In childhood meningitis, Haemophilus influenzae was the most common causative organism (42.3%), and followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (22.2%) and Salmonella sp (12.4%). Excluding a 13 year-old leukemic patient, Salmonella meningitis occurred exclusively in infants, 87% of them were under six months, and 13% of them developed relapsing meningitis. Presenting symptoms and signs on admission of neonatal meningitis such as fever (81.8%), convulsions (45.4%), neck stiffness (22.5%), bulging fontanelle (33.3%) and Brudzinski sign (11.5%) were significantly less frequent than in the patients beyond the neonatal period (p < 0.05). The overall fatalities during 1980-1990 were 45.4% and 17.3% for neonatal meningitis and childhood meningitis, respectively. The fatalities of the two age groups declined significantly during 1987-1990 to 26.3% and 11.4% respectively.
TI  - Clarification of the structure of the ampicillin-resistance plasmid RSF0885 from  Haemophilus influenzae HR-885 serotype b.
AB  - The nonconjugative ampicillin-resistance plasmid RSF0885 has been reported to be  as small as 2.9 MDa and as large as 4.1 MDa with at least two restriction enzyme maps reported. In addition, the source of the original plasmid has been reported to be Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. Characterization of the source strains and sequencing data of the plasmids revealed that H. influenzae serotype b was the original source strain and that IS1-K in the larger plasmid was presumably acquired when the smaller plasmid was maintained in Escherichia coli in S. Falkow's laboratory during the late 1970s.
TI  - [Bacteriologic study of 80 cases of acute otitis media in children].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Etiology of acute otitis media (AOM) in children is almost unknown in our country. We report 80 cases in order to study the most common pathogens. METHODS: Eighty healthy children diagnosed of acute otitis media were studied between June 1989 and March 1992. Tympanocentesis was performed on each patient with an Abbocath-20G needle connected to a sterile syringe. RESULTS: Some pathogens was isolated in 58 patients (72.5%) and in 22 (27.5%) the culture was sterile or with usual flora of the external canal. S. pneumoniae was recovered in 26 cases (32.5%); H. influenzae in 23 cases (28.7%); S. pyogenes 4 cases (5%); E. coli 4; P. aeruginosa 3 (3.7%); S. aureus 2 (2.5%); anaerobes 2 cases. M. catarrhalis was not found in any cases. In 6 children there was mixed flore. CONCLUSIONS: In 80 children with AOM some pathogens was isolated in 58 cases (72.5%). The most common agents were S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae.
TI  - Identification of a gene essential for piliation in Haemophilus influenzae type b with homology to the pilus assembly platform genes of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) pili are complex filamentous surface structures consisting predominantly of pilin protein subunits. The gene encoding the major pilin protein subunit of Hib adherence pili has been cloned and its nucleotide sequence has been determined. In order to identify specific accessory genes involved in pilus expression and assembly, we constructed isogenic Hib mutants containing insertional chromosomal mutations in the DNA flanking the pilin structural gene. These mutants were screened for pilin production, pilus expression, and hemagglutination. Pili and pilin production were assessed by immunoassays with polyclonal antisera specific for pilin and pili of Hib strain Eagan. Hemagglutination was semiquantitatively evaluated in a microtiter plate assay. Six Hib mutants produced proteins immunoreactive with antipilin antiserum but no longer produced structures reactive with antipilus antiserum. In addition, the mutants were unable to agglutinate human erythrocytes. Nucleotide sequence analysis localized the insertion sites in the six mutants to 2.5-kb open reading frame upstream of the pilin structural gene and immediately downstream of an Hib pilin chaperone gene. The amino acid sequence encoded by this open reading frame has significant homology to members of the pilus assembly platform protein family, including FhaA of Bordetella pertussis, MrkC of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and the Escherichia coli assembly platform proteins FimD and PapC. This open reading frame, designated hifC, appears to represent a gene essential to Hib pilus biogenesis that has genetic and functional similarity to the pilus platform assembly genes of other gram-negative rods.
TI  - PCR primers and probes for the 16S rRNA gene of most species of pathogenic bacteria, including bacteria found in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - A set of broad-range PCR primers for the 16S rRNA gene in bacteria were tested, along with three series of oligonucleotide probes to detect the PCR product. The first series of probes is broad in range and consists of a universal bacterial probe, a gram-positive probe, a Bacteroides-Flavobacterium probe, and two probes for other gram-negative species. The second series was designed to detect PCR products from seven major bacterial species or groups frequently causing meningitis: Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. The third series was designed for the detection of DNA from species or genera commonly considered potential contaminants of clinical samples, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): Bacillus, Corynebacterium, Propionibacterium, and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. The primers amplified DNA from all 124 different species of bacteria tested. Southern hybridization testing of the broad-range probes with washes containing 3 M tetramethylammonium chloride indicated that this set of probes correctly identified all but two of the 102 bacterial species tested, the exceptions being Deinococcus radiopugnans and Gardnerella vaginalis. The gram-negative and gram-positive probes hybridized to isolates of two newly characterized bacteria, Alloiococcus otitis and Rochalimaea henselii, as predicted by Gram stain characteristics. The CSF pathogen and contaminant probe sequences were compared with available sequence information and with sequencing data for 32 different species. Testing of the CSF pathogen and contaminant probes against DNA from over 60 different strains indicated that, with the exception of the coagulase-negative Staphylococcus probes, these probes provided the correct identification of bacterial species known to be found in CSF.
TI  - Comparative crossover assessment of serum bactericidal activity and pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin.
AB  - The study compared the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin in 12 healthy male volunteers with normal renal function. Each volunteer received oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg, intravenous (i.v.) ciprofloxacin 400 mg, oral ofloxacin 400 mg, or i.v. ofloxacin 400 mg in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design with a one-week 'washout' period between doses. Mean peak serum concentrations were 4.48 and 5.44 mg/L for i.v. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, respectively. For the oral regimens, mean peak serum concentrations were 2.45 mg/L for ciprofloxacin and 4.44 mg/L for ofloxacin. Minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) and serum bactericidal activity (SBA) for each drug were measured against five strains of each of the following species: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter anitratus, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, using the microdilution method of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). Ciprofloxacin was more active in vitro than ofloxacin against the tested species of Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa, while ofloxacin was slightly more active against A. anitratus. MBCs for the two drugs were similar for H. influenzae and S. aureus. Oral and i.v. ciprofloxacin in the doses given resulted in nearly equivalent SBA. Similarly, oral and i.v. ofloxacin had nearly equivalent SBA. For the i.v. and oral regimens of both agents, peak SBA was > or = 2 throughout the 12-hour test period against the Enterobacteriaceae and H. influenzae. At peak concentrations, both drugs had modest SBA against P. aeruginosa, A. anitratus, and S. aureus but little or no activity 8 and 12 h after dosing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The comparative pharmacokinetics and tissue penetration of single-dose ciprofloxacin 400 mg i.v. and 750 mg po.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin following single doses of 400 mg i.v. and 750 mg po were compared in six healthy volunteers. Concentrations of ciprofloxacin were measured in plasma, cantharides induced blister fluid and urine, by microbiological assay and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Mean peak plasma concentration was 6.7 +/- 1.4 mg/L after i.v. and 3.9 +/- 1.7 mg/L after oral administration with mean elimination half-lives of 4.2 and 4.0 h respectively. Mean area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) was greater following oral administration (19.2 +/- 1.1 mg/L.h versus 14.2 +/- 1.1 mg/L.h). Blister fluid peak concentrations following i.v. and oral administration were 2.6 +/- 1.3 mg/L and 2.28 +/- 1.2 mg/L respectively. The elimination half-life from blister fluid was 4.1 +/- 1.1 h and the AUC 13.8 +/- 1.1 mg/L.h following i.v. administration compared with 4.6 +/- 1.5 h and 20.3 +/- 1.3 mg/L.h for the oral dose. A mean of 50.8% of i.v. administered drug and 39.6% or orally administered drug was excreted in urine in 24 h as measured by HPLC. The corresponding values by microbiological assay were greater, suggesting excretion of active metabolites. Both i.v. and oral doses produced levels in blister fluid concentration above the MICs for most Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria spp. at 12 h post dose. The pharmacokinetic data from inflammatory fluid indicate that ciprofloxacin 400 mg i.v. is more equivalent to 750 mg po than the plasma pharmacokinetic data suggest.
TI  - [In vitro antimicrobial susceptibilities and beta-lactamase production of clinical isolates. beta-Lactamase Study Group in Chubu-area].
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibilities and beta-lactamase production of clinical isolates from 1986 to 1991 except 1988 were determined. beta-Lactamase was detected frequently in Escherichia coli (84.7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (65.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (62.3%), and not frequently in Haemophilus influenzae (22.4%). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus was also resistant to many antimicrobials except to arbekacin and minocycline, and imipenem showed markedly high activity against methicillin-sensitive S. aureus. Susceptibilities of E. coli and K. pneumoniae to cefuzonam, imipenem and ofloxacin were quite high and that of H. influenzae to ofloxacin and cefuzonam was also very high.

TI  - Microbiology and management of otitis media.
AB  - Otitis media is a complex and multifactorial condition with four defined stages:  myringitis, acute otitis media, secretory (serous) otitis media and chronic otitis media. Drugs utilized in its treatment are antihistamines, decongestants, mucolytic agents, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, corticosteroids, vaccine therapy and antibiotics. The rationale for using antibiotics is that inflammation has been associated with the presence of virulent bacteria in all types of otitis media. In acute otitis media the major organisms, present are Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. In chronic otitis media these organisms, plus Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and anaerobic bacteria are all prevalent. The microbiological flora of the middle ear in secretory otitis media is almost identical with that in acute otitis media. Empirical therapy can be given in most instances of acute and serous otitis media. However, in cases of failure, in the immunocompromised and in instances of chronic otitis media, establishing the individual microbiology of the inflamed middle ear is very helpful. The growing resistance of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis to amoxycillin, due to beta-lactamase production, increases the risk of treatment failure of acute and serous otitis media. By adding a beta-lactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid) to amoxycillin, or using second-generation cephalosporins, clearance can be achieved. Management of chronic otitis media requires surgical correction, drainage and coverage of anaerobic bacteria with agents such as amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, or clindamycin plus antimicrobials against other pathogens such as Pseudomonas spp. where present.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of cefdinir (FK482), a new oral cephalosporin with enhanced antistaphylococcal activity and beta-lactamase stability.
AB  - Cefdinir (FK482), a new oral cephalosporin with enhanced beta-lactamase stability, was tested by microbroth dilution against respiratory, urogenital, and skin and skin-structure bacterial pathogens. Included were beta-lactamase (beta LAC)-producing and -nonproducing isolates. Activity was compared with that of other orally administered beta-lactams. Cefdinir minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates MIC90s (microgram/ml) were < or = 0.5 versus beta LAC+/oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus, aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. saprophyticus; < or = 0.06 versus Streptococcus groups A and B, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae beta LAC+; 0.125 versus S. pneumoniae penicillin-susceptible and Proteus mirabilis beta LAC+; 0.25 versus beta LAC+ versus strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and K. oxytoca; 0.5 versus Haemophilus influenzae beta LAC-; 1 versus H. influenzae beta LAC+; 4 versus Legionella pneumophila beta LAC+; and 8 versus Enterococcus faecalis beta LAC-strains. Cefdinir was equally effective against both standard and high inocula of S. aureus strains producing A, B, C, or D beta LAC types. MICs were also generated versus quality-control reference strains.
TI  - [Comparison of amoxicillin and cefamandole in the prevention of bronchopulmonary  infections in pulmonary surgery. A randomized double-blind study].
AB  - Antibiotic prophylaxis is currently recommended in clean-contamined surgery (type II of Altemeier classification). Pulmonary surgery belongs to this type. This prospective randomized and controlled study was designed to compare amoxicillin and cefamandole for prevention of pleural and bronchopulmonary infections after pulmonary resections. It included 256 patients, admitted between October 1st 1989 and July 1st 1991, for elective thoracotomy and probable pulmonary resection. The patients were allocated into two groups, group A (amoxicillin) and group C (cefamandole). The first intravenous antibiotic injection took place immediately after induction of anaesthesia (1 g of amoxicillin or 1.5 g of cefamandole). Postoperative injections were performed every 6 hours during 36 hours (i.e. a total of 6 injections). Infection was defined by the association of general signs including hyperthermia (> 38 degrees C), hyperleucocytosis (> 12,000/mm3), and local signs such as bronchitis (B), pneumonia (P), empyema (E), wound sepsis (W) and non thoracic infection (S). Follow-up included the hospital stay and a period of eight months after surgery for possible rehospitalisation for infection. Respiratory infections (bronchitis n = 35, pneumonia n = 5, empyema n = 2) occurred in 18% of the total population. No difference was seen between the two groups concerning the type of infection and the repartition of infection in relation to the type of pulmonary surgery. The causative bacterial organisms were Haemophilus influenzae (n = 4), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 2), Escherichia coli (n = 1), anaerobic bacteria (n = 1). Multiple bacteria were found in one case. The empyema and wound sepsis occurred in the amoxicillin group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Bacterial meningitis in patients with sepsis syndrome].
AB  - The authors discuss problems connected with diagnosis, management and treatment of bacterial meningitis among patients with the sepsis syndrome. Considering secondary organ changes bacterial meningitis belongs to the severest one and as a life-threathing sequel of sepsis demands immediate use of proper casual treatment. The authors show the therapeutic difficulties in this group of patients particularly when the etiological organism is unknown. They discuss this problems and present their own schemes of tretment. They indicate the value of passive immunotherapy and surgical removal of the primary source of infection. They emphasize final result depends on secondary organ changes, age, immunity of patient and the kind of etiological agent.
TI  - The role of HSV-induced Fc- and C3b (i)-receptors in bacterial adherence.
AB  - Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) induces Fc- and C3b(i)-receptors on infected  cells. The role of these receptors in bacterial superinfection was studied by comparing the adherence of non-opsonised and opsonised bacteria to HSV-infected and non-infected HEp-2 cells. A flow cytometric adherence assay, based on the fluorescent quantitation of FITC-labelled bacteria, was developed. Opsonisation of Staphylococcus epidermidis with human serum, resulted in a marked increase in adherence to HSV-infected cells and revealed a role for C3b(i)R- and FcR-mediated adhesion. However, the enhanced adherence never exceeded the level of attachment to non-infected cells. Increased adherence of other pathogenic bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not observed, indicating that the HSV-receptors play a minor role in secondary infections. Bacterial adhesion factors such as the fimbriae of E. coli played a more dominant role in the adherence of bacteria to HSV-infected cells.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of cefepime in vitro.
AB  - Cefepime is a new parenterally active fourth-generation cephalosporin which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. Using the standard agar dilution method we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli (98 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (99 strains), Acinetobacter spp. (24 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (98 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (108 strains), Staphylococcus aureus (100 strains), Enterococcus spp. (45 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (10 strains), Streptococcus pyogenes (group A; 19 strains) and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B; 36 strains). Cefepime showed excellent activity against E. coli and K. pneumoniae, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 0.12 mg/l. The in vitro activity of cefepime was superior to or comparable to the third-generation cephalosporins tested but was inferior to ciprofloxacin against Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa. Against H. influenzae, whether or not the strains produced beta-lactamase, its activity was similar to comparable drugs. All 84 isolates of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime whereas, like other cephalosporins, it had little activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Of the 45 enterococci isolates tested, 44.4% were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime. Against streptococci, its activity was superior to any drug tested. This in vitro study indicates that cefepime has the potential to be a valuable agent for the treatment of community- and hospital-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.
TI  - Agar disk diffusion (Bauer-Kirby) tests with various fastidious and nonfastidious reference (ATCC) strains: comparison of several agar media.
AB  - Several agar media (Mueller-Hinton agar, MHA; diagnostic sensitivity test agar, DSTA; Schaedler agar, SchA; Todd-Hewitt agar with added yeast extract, THYA; Wilkins-Chalgren agar, WCA) were compared using the Bauer-Kirby agar disk diffusion test against six nonfastidious quality control strains: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and ATCC 29213, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and ATCC 35218, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212. MHA, DSTA, and THYA yielded essentially comparable inhibition zones. However, WCA and SchA antagonized cotrimoxazole and aminoglycoside antibiotics; furthermore, SchA antagonized polymyxin B, and both WCA and SchA antagonized imipenem against the P. aeruginosa strain, but not against the E. coli strains. Sheep blood-MHA (Bl-MHA), WCA, THYA, and DSTA were examined with Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615, Streptococcus agalactiae ATCC 13813, and Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 6306. In comparison with Bl-MHA, both WCA and THYA yielded comparable inhibition zones against S. pyogenes; DSTA afforded suboptimal growth. DSTA yielded larger inhibition zones with the majority of antimicrobial drugs against S. agalactiae, whereas WCA and THYA enhanced the activity of oxacillin and penicillin G against this strain. S. pneumoniae strain ATCC 6306 grew well on Bl-MHA, yielded suboptimal growth on WCA and faint growth on THYA, and failed to grow on DSTA. Chocolate-supplemented sheep blood-MHA (CHOC-MHA) was compared with Haemophilus test medium (HTM), WCA with added NAD, and THYA with added hematin and NAD against Haemophilus influenzae strains ATCC 35056 and ATCC 49247. The activities of doxycycline and rifampin were enhanced against both strains by HTM, WCA+NAD, and THYA+hematin+NAD. Only WCA+NAD antagonized cotrimoxazole against both H. influenzae strains, an effect due to thymidine; however, HTM antagonized cotrimoxazole against S. aureus ATCC 25923 and E. coli ATCC 25922. It was concluded that Bl-MHA performed best for beta-hemolytic streptococci quality control strains. Likewise, CHOC-MHA was optimal for the two H. influenzae strains used in this comparative agar disk diffusion study.
TI  - The sequence of the Haemophilus influenzae mutB gene indicates it encodes a DNA helicase II-like protein.
AB  - A 6.2-kb Haemophilus influenzae genomic DNA fragment which partially complemented both the mutator and ultraviolet light sensitive (UVs) phenotypes of the H. influenzae mutB1 mutant was isolated. This fragment was also able to complement the UVs phenotype of Escherichia coli uvrD mutant hosts. The uvrD+ gene complemented the mutator phenotype of mutB1 hosts. The nucleotide (nt) sequence of the 6.2-kb fragment revealed an open reading frame (ORF) of 2184 bp. This ORF shows similarity at both the nt and amino acid (aa) levels with the uvrD gene of E. coli. Comparison of the sequences revealed eight regions of aa conservation in addition to seven previously identified helicase superfamily domains. The nt sequence 5' to the mutB ORF contains several potential regulatory motifs, including a LexA-binding site. Based upon these observations, we are confident that the mutB gene of H. influenzae encodes an ATP-dependent DNA helicase-like activity.
TI  - The Haemophilus influenzae dnaG sequence and conserved bacterial primase motifs.
AB  - The dnaG gene encodes primase which synthesizes the primer RNA essential for Escherichia coli chromosomal DNA replication. The nucleotide sequence was determined for the Haemophilus influenzae dnaG gene and used in the molecular evolutionary analysis of primases from six bacterial species. The predicted amino acid (aa) sequence of H. influenzae DnaG contains 593 residues and shares 56% identity with E. coli DnaG. The N-terminal 60% of six aligned bacterial primases contains all 71 absolutely conserved aa residues and several conserved motifs. All six bacterial primases which were sequenced contained a conserved CPFHXEKTPSF(T/S/A)VXXXKQX(F/Y)HCFGC zinc finger (zf) in the N terminus. A basic region in the N-terminal half of the primases contains a conserved motif, G(R/K)X(V/I/L)X(F/Y) (G/S/A)(G/S/A)RX(V/I/L)XXXXP, termed 'RNAP-basic', which is shared only with RNA polymerase (RNAP) large subunits. This conserved sequence represents the first motif common and specific to primases and RNAP subunits. The consensus sequence, PKYLNSPET, lies adjacent to this basic region in bacterial primases and may represent a signature sequence for bacterial DnaG. The C-terminal regions of these primases do not appear to share primary sequence similarities. These findings support our hypothesis that the primase active site of DnaG is located in the N-terminal 60% of the enzyme.
TI  - Structural and physico-chemical characteristics of Bordetella pertussis adenylate kinase, a tryptophan-containing enzyme.
AB  - The adk gene from the Gram-negative pathogen Bordetella pertussis was cloned by complementing the thermosensitive Escherichia coli adk strain CR341T28. B. pertussis adenylate kinase is a 218-amino-acid protein that has high similarity with adenylate kinase from Escherichia coli and Hemophilus influenzae (57%). A distinct characteristic of enzyme from B. pertussis, not found in other bacterial adenylate kinases, is the presence of a tryptophan residue at position 185. Although distant from the catalytic site, this single tryptophan serves as a convenient probe for monitoring the binding of nucleotide substrates or analogs to the enzyme. Differential scanning calorimetry and equilibrium unfolding experiments in guanidine.HCl indicate similar stabilities for adenylate kinase from B. pertussis and E. coli. An extensive comparison between physico-chemical properties of adenylate kinase from B. pertussis and the enzyme from E. coli showed that the kinetic and structural properties of the two enzymes are very similar. However, infrared spectroscopy has allowed to identify small but significant differences in the secondary structure of the two proteins.
TI  - Choosing between the new cephalosporin antibiotics: a pharmacodynamic approach.
AB  - The use of pharmacodynamic properties when formulating antibacterial administration guidelines can maximise the potential for efficacy while minimising the risk of toxicity. Aminoglycosides and quinolones demonstrate concentration-dependent bactericidal killing, which is maximised when their concentrations appreciably exceed their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for an organism. beta-Lactams demonstrate time-dependent or concentration-independent bactericidal killing, which is maximised when the time that concentrations exceed the MIC is prolonged, regardless of the absolute levels attained. Methods of prolonging the time beta-lactam concentrations exceed the MIC include the following: interfering with excretion (e.g. probenecid); decreasing the dosage interval; increasing the dose; infusing continuously rather than by bolus; and choosing an agent with a prolonged elimination half-life. The optimal duration for exceeding the MIC varies with the infecting organism, site of infection, inoculum effect, and the immunocompetence of the host. Integration of the microbiological activity and pharmacokinetic properties enables estimation of the time that serum concentrations of various cephalosporins will exceed the MIC of a given organism, consequently allowing estimation of the relative potential for clinical success. Cefixime, a third generation oral cephalosporin with a long plasma elimination half-life, allowing once-daily administration, achieves serum concentrations that exceed the MIC of Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, and Group A streptococci for greater than 90% of the dosage interval, and the MIC of Streptococcus pneumoniae for 50 to 90% of the dosage interval.
TI  - Characterization of the Neisseria Iga beta-core. The essential unit for outer membrane targeting and extracellular protein secretion.
AB  - Extracellular transport of Neisseria IgA proteases across the bacterial outer membrane is accomplished by the translocation function contained within the C-terminal Iga beta domain of IgA protease precursor proteins. Recently, we reported that Iga beta from N. gonorrhoeae MS11 (Val1097 to Phe1505), fused to a periplasmic passenger protein, facilitated its transport across the outer membrane, leading to surface exposure of the passenger. In the present work we show, by systematic N-terminal truncation of Iga beta, that the functional and structural unit, termed Iga beta-core, corresponds to the C-terminal approximately 274 amino acid residues (Ser1231 to Phe1505). This minimal region retains all the essential features necessary for the translocation of an N-terminally attached passenger across the outer membrane of Escherichia coli, and for its own correct integration into the outer membrane, even in the absence of a passenger protein. The membrane-integrated Iga beta-core constitutes a conserved entity found in the C-terminal regions of Iga beta domains of different N. gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae strains. In contrast, the surface-exposed N termini of the Iga beta domains vary in size and sequence. Based on secondary structure predictions, the key structural feature of the core is a beta-barrel (amphipathic, antiparallel transmembrane beta-strands, interspersed by hairpin turns and loops) which is common to many integral outer membrane proteins of Gram-negative bacteria. We propose that the core has been conserved in evolution, to provide a selective outer membrane export channel for covalently attached polypeptides.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, expression, and complementation analysis of the Escherichia  coli K1 kps region 1 gene, kpsE, and identification of an upstream open reading frame encoding a protein with homology to GutQ.
AB  - The kps locus for polysialic acid capsule expression in Escherichia coli K1 is composed of a central group of biosynthetic neu genes, designated region 2, flanked on either side by region 1 or region 3 kps genes with poorly defined functions. Chromosomal mutagenesis with MudJ and subsequent complementation analysis, maxicell and in vitro protein expression studies, and nucleotide sequencing identified the region 1 gene, kpsE, which encodes a 39-kDa polypeptide. Polarity of the kpsE::lacZ mutation suggests an operonic structure for region 1. KpsE is homologous to putative polysaccharide-translocation components previously identified in Haemophilus influenzae type b and Neisseria meningitidis group B. An open reading frame upstream of kpsE encodes a 35-kDa polypeptide with homology to GutQ, a putative ATP-binding protein of unknown function encoded by gutQ of the glucitol utilization operon. Whether expression of the gutQ homolog as the potential first gene of region 1 is required for polysialic acid synthesis or localization is presently unknown.
TI  - The pharmacokinetics, tissue penetration and in-vitro activity of loracarbef, a beta-lactam antibiotic of the carbacephem class.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of loracarbef in plasma and a mild inflammatory exudate were studied in human volunteers. After a single oral dose of 400 mg, a mean maximum drug concentration (Cmax) of 17.8 mg/L was achieved in the plasma at 1.2 h (mean Tmax). The mean plasma elimination half-life (T1/2) was 1.3 h. In the inflammatory exudate the mean Cmax was 8.9 mg/L at a mean Tmax of 2.0 h and with a mean T1/2 of 1.7 h. The mean penetration into the inflammatory exudate was 90.1%. The in-vitro activity of loracarbef was determined against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90s of 4 mg/L and 1 mg/L respectively, regardless of beta-lactamase production), as well as Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 of 2 mg/L). Loracarbef was also active against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC90s of < or = 2 mg/L). The in-vitro activity and pharmacokinetics of loracarbef suggest that it would be efficative therapy for patients with community-acquired respiratory and urinary tract infections caused by the most frequently-encountered bacterial pathogens.
TI  - The secretion pathway of IgA protease-type proteins in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The pathogenic, Gram-negative bacteria, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae, secrete immunoglobulin A1 proteases into their extracellular surroundings. An extraordinary feature in the secretory pathway of these putative virulence factors is a self-directed outer membrane transport step allowing the proteins to be secreted autonomously, even from foreign Gram-negative host cells like Escherichia coli. Here we summarize recent achievements in the understanding of IgA protease outer membrane translocation.
TI  - [Clinical study of S-1108 fine granule in the pediatric field].
AB  - S-1108 in a fine granular form was administered in 14 children and its safety and efficacy in bacterial infections were evaluated. Among them, 2 cases of cystitis and 1 case of pneumonia were considered unevaluable for the efficacy. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. The overall clinical efficacy rate was 81.8% in the eleven evaluable cases treated with S-1108 fine granules including 5 cases of pharyngitis, 2 cases each of tonsillitis, pertussis and cystitis. 2. Bacteriological efficacy of 100% was achieved against pathogens identified in 5 children including 1 case each of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae and 2 cases of Escherichia coli. 3. The only abnormal laboratory test results observed were eosinophilia and leukocytopenia in one case each. Diarrhea was recorded in 1 case. Judging from the above results, it appears that S-1108 in the fine granular form is an effective, useful and safe antibiotic of first choice for the treatment of infections in the pediatric field.
TI  - [Clinical studies of S-1108 granules in the pediatric field].
AB  - We studied the clinical use of S-1108 granules in the pediatric field. The results are summarized as follows. 1. S-1108 was administered orally at doses ranging 6.85 and 17.6 mg/kg/day t.i.d. to 9 patients, including 5 cases of pharyngitis and 1 case each of lacunar tonsillitis, bronchitis, pneumonia and urinary tract infection. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 4 cases and good in 5 cases, hence an efficacy rate of 100% was obtained. 2. Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae (2 strains each) and Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis (1 strain each) were identified in these cases. Seven of the 8 strains were eliminated upon treatment and the other strain was decreased, hence an eradication rate of 87.5% was obtained. 3. Side effects observed were 1 case each of soft stools and diarrhea. As an abnormal laboratory test result, an increase in GPT level was observed. 4. No refusal of the drug occurred. 5. From the above results, we consider that this drug would be a useful new oral antibiotic for the pediatric field.
TI  - Three contiguous lipoprotein genes in Pasteurella haemolytica A1 which are homologous to a lipoprotein gene in Haemophilus influenzae type b.
AB  - An Escherichia coli clone carrying the recombinant plasmid pPH24 has been found to express highly immunoreactive antigens of Pasteurella haemolytica A1. Two or three antigens of approximately 30 kDa were located to both the inner and outer membranes of the E. coli clone and in P. haemolytica A1. From the insert DNA of 8.2 kbp on pPH24, a fragment of 4.6 kbp was found to code for these antigens. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the 4.6-kbp DNA identified three genes (designated plpA, -B, and -C) arranged in tandem which code for three proteins, Plp1, -2, and -3, with predicted molecular masses of 30.1, 30.3, and 29.0 kDa, respectively. Comparison of the nucleic acid sequence of plpA, -B, and -C with GenBank sequences showed extensive homology with a Haemophilus influenzae 28-kDa lipoprotein gene. [14C]palmitate labelling coupled with glybomycin inhibition experiments showed that Plp1, -2, and -3 are also lipoproteins. In addition, plpA, -B, and -C were found to be present only in A biotypes of P. haemolytica by Southern blot analysis. Since Plp1, -2, and -3 were found to be antigenic components in a culture supernatant vaccine, they could be candidates for further investigation as vaccine components.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on S-1108 in the pediatric field].
AB  - Laboratory and Clinical Studies on S-1108, a new oral cephem antibiotic, were carried out to evaluate its usefulness at a dose between 2 and 4 mg/kg a day for 7 to 14 days in the pediatric field. 1) Pharmacokinetic studies S-1108 at a dose of 2 mg/kg was administered to evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters in 1 subject. Cmax, T1/2 and AUC were 0.69 hour, 1.42 hours and 2.15 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. 2) Antimicrobial activities MICs against various clinically isolated organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae) were determined. The MIC values of S-1006 were similar to those of cefteram, the MICs against S. pyogenes, and H. influenzae were < or = 0.025 and 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. 3) Clinical studies S-1108 was administered to patients with various pediatrics infections in 34 cases (upper respiratory tract infections: 12 cases, lower respiratory tract infections: 5 cases, urinary tract infections: 9 cases, skin and soft tissue infection: 6 cases, otitis media: 2 cases). Clinical efficacy rate was evaluated according to "Standard of clinical evaluation in pediatrics field". The responses were all good or excellent. 4) Side reactions There were no serious adverse reactions in any cases. The above results suggest that S-1108 is potent effective and safe agent in the pediatric field at a dose between 2-4 mg/kg (t.i.d.) a day.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of S-1108 in children].
AB  - A new oral cephem antibiotic, S-1108, was evaluated for its clinical efficacy and safety in children. S-1108 was effective in 95% of the 59 examined cases of respiratory, middle ear, skin and urinary tract infections. S-1108 was highly effective in infections of Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli, but was less effective in penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus infections. The serum half-life was 1.26 +/- 0.36 hours upon after meal administration of 4 mg/kg. No severe adverse reaction was encountered. From these data, S-1108 appears to be safe and effective in children with susceptible bacterial infections.
TI  - Structural organization, nucleotide sequence, and regulation of the Haemophilus influenzae rec-1+ gene.
AB  - The Haemophilus influenzae rec-1+ protein plays a central role in DNA metabolism, participating in general homologous recombination, recombinational (postreplication) DNA repair, and prophage induction. Although many H. influenzae rec-1 mutants have been phenotypically characterized, little is known about the rec-1+ gene at the molecular level. In this study, we present the genetic organization of the rec-1+ locus, the DNA sequence of rec-1+, and studies of the transcriptional regulation of rec-1+ during cellular assault by DNA-damaging agents and during the induction of competence for genetic transformation. Although little is known about promoter structure in H. influenzae, we identified a potential rec-1+ promoter that is identical in 11 of 12 positions to the bacterial sigma 70-dependent promoter consensus sequence. Results from a primer extension analysis revealed that the start site of rec-1+ transcription is centered 6 nucleotides downstream of this promoter. We identified potential DNA binding sites in the rec-1+ gene for LexA, integration host factor, and cyclic AMP receptor protein. We obtained evidence that at least one of the proposed cyclic AMP receptor protein binding sites is active in modulating rec-1+ transcription. This finding makes rec-1+ control circuitry novel among recA+ homologs. Two H. influenzae DNA uptake sequences that may function as a transcription termination signal were identified in inverted orientations at the end of the rec-1+ coding sequence. In addition, we report the first use of the Escherichia coli lacZ operon fusion technique in H. influenzae to study the transcriptional control of rec-1+. Our results indicate that rec-1+ is transcriptionally induced about threefold during DNA-damaging events. Furthermore, we show that rec-1+ can substitute for recA+ in E. coli to modulate SOS induction of dinB1 expression. Surprisingly, although 5% of the H. influenzae genome is in the form of single-stranded DNA during competence for genetic transformation, an event that could be a potent SOS-inducing signal, we failed to detect significant changes in rec-1+ transcription during the induction of genetic competence.
TI  - The Haemophilus influenzae adenylate cyclase gene: cloning, sequence, and essential role in competence.
AB  - Competence for transformation in Haemophilus influenzae is stimulated by cyclic AMP (cAMP) and requires the cAMP-dependent catabolite regulatory protein CRP. Thus, understanding the control of competence will require understanding how cAMP levels are regulated. As a first step, we have cloned the H. influenzae adenylate cyclase gene (cya) by complementing the Lac- phenotype of delta cya Escherichia coli. Its sequence specifies an 843-amino-acid protein which has significant identity to other known bacterial adenylate cyclases (41 to 43% and 61% identical to the cya genes of enteric bacteria and of Pasteurella multocida, respectively). As seen in other bacterial cya genes, there is evidence for regulation similar to that demonstrated for E. coli: the presence of a strong consensus CRP binding site within the promoter of the gene may provide feedback control of cAMP levels by repressing cya transcription, and translation may be limited by the weak ribosome binding site and by initiation of protein synthesis with GUG rather than AUG or the UUG used in other bacterial cya genes. We confirmed the essential role of cAMP in competence by constructing and characterizing H. influenzae cya mutants. This strain failed to develop competence either spontaneously or after transfer to a competence-inducing medium. However, it became as competent as its wild-type parent in the presence of exogenous cAMP. This result suggests that the failure of exogenously added cAMP to induce optimum competence in wild-type cells is not due to a limitation to the entry of cAMP into the cells. Rather, it strongly favors models in which competence induction requires both an increase in intracellular cAMP and a second as yet unidentified regulatory event. H. influenzae strains mutant in cya or crp were unable to ferment xylose or ribose. This confirms that influenzae, like E. coli, uses cAMP and CRP to regulate nutrient uptake and utilization and lends increasing support to the hypothesis that DNA uptake is mechanism of nutrient acquisition.
TI  - Cefepime: overview of activity in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - Cefepime is a novel methoxyimino-aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a quaternized  N-methyl-pyrrolidine moiety at the 3' position conferring zwitterionic properties. Because of this the molecule penetrates the outer cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria rapidly. In addition it is resistant to degradation by several plasmid and chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases, for which it also shows very low affinity and no inducing capacity. It has good affinity for PBPs 2 and 3 of Escherichia coli and for PBP 3 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Its broad-spectrum of activity includes Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. It is more active than cefotaxime or ceftazidime, against Enterobacteriaceae. The MIC90 for P. aeruginosa is higher than that of ceftazidime, but lower than those of cefpirome, cefoperazone and latamoxef. Other Gram-negative organisms, Haemophilus influenzae, Neiserria meningitidis, Neiserria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella catarrhalis are highly susceptible to cefepime. Among Gram-positive species methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, whether beta-lactamase producers or not, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes are susceptible. Cefepime is active against cefotaxime- and/or ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Only strains of P. aeruginosa producing large amounts of beta-lactamase may be resistant to both ceftazidime and cefepime. In experimental infections such as meningitis, induced with various bacterial species in neonatal rats and chronic staphylococcal osteomyelitis in rabbits, cefepime has shown good efficacy.
TI  - Low-dosage cefepime as treatment for serious bacterial infections.
AB  - Since infection develops in significant numbers of hospitalized patients, the problem of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins is of increasing concern. We evaluated the efficacy of cefepime 1 g bd as treatment for acute, moderately severe bacterial infection in 239 hospitalized patients (mean age 60 years). Of these patients, 204 were evaluated clinically for urinary tract infection (UTI) (n = 90), lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) (n = 70), skin and soft tissue infection (S/STI) (n = 12) and bacteraemia which was associated with either UTI or LRTI (n = 32) but not included in the previously mentioned UTI and LRTI groups. Amongst the pathogens isolated (36 Gram-positive, 150 Gram-negative), the most predominant species were Escherichia coli in UTI and bacteraemia (n = 81), Streptococcus pneumoniae in LRTI and bacteraemia (n = 23), Haemophilus influenzae in LRTI (n = 16), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4) and Enterobacter cloacae (n = 2) in S/STI. The mean duration of treatment was 8.5 days and was the same for the 204 clinically evaluable patients. Overall, the clinical cure rate for cefepime was 94% (191/204). Pathogen eradication was achieved in 93% (185/199) of infections. Of the patients with associated bacteraemia, the clinical cure rate was 97% (31/32) and 94% (16/17) of the pathogens were eradicated. Cefepime therapy was well-tolerated. Treatment was discontinued in eight patients (3%) because of local intolerance and in five patients (2%) because of drug-related adverse events (rash, headache and pruritus). Cefepime 1 g bd is as safe and effective as other parenteral cephalosporins for the treatment of acute bacterial UTI, LRTI and S/STI, including those cases with associated bacteraemia. The bd dosing schedule and reported lack of cross-resistance with other cephalosporins against some species of aerobic Gram-negative bacilli make cefepime an attractive treatment option in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Limited diversity of the protein D gene (hpd) among encapsulated and nonencapsulated Haemophilus influenzae strains.
AB  - Protein D is a surface-exposed lipoprotein of the gram-negative bacterium Haemophilus influenzae with affinity for human immunoglobulin D myeloma protein. The gene encoding protein D (hpd) in a serotype b strain of H. influenzae was cloned. Escherichia coli carrying the hpd gene bound human myeloma immunoglobulin D. Nucleotide sequence analysis identified an 1,092-bp open reading frame that was more than 99% identical to the hpd gene from a nontypeable H. influenzae strain. In the deduced amino acid sequences for protein D, only 2 of 364 amino acid residues differed. The restriction fragment length polymorphism of the hpd region in different strains was analyzed by Southern blot analyses of PstI- or EcoRI-digested genomic DNA from 100 H. influenzae strains. The analysis was performed by using isolated fragments of the cloned hpd gene, originating from the nontypeable H. influenzae 772, as probes. All strains tested had DNA sequences with a high degree of homology to the hpd probes. The analysis also showed that restriction endonuclease sites within the gene were more conserved than sites adjacent to the hpd gene. An interesting difference between type b strains and unencapsulated strains was observed. The majority of type b strains seem to have a 1.4-kbp DNA fragment upstream of the hpd gene that is absent in nontypeable strains. On the basis of the high degree of conservation of the hpd gene among H. influenzae strains, we conclude that protein D is a possible vaccine candidate.
TI  - Molecular and genetic characterization of superoxide dismutase in Haemophilus influenzae type b.
AB  - Oxygen free radicals present a serious potential threat to microbial survival, through their ability to inflict indiscriminate damage on proteins and DNA. Superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1), among other oxygen-metabolizing enzymes, is essential to prevent these toxic molecules from accumulating in the bacterial cytosol during aerobic metabolism. The gene sodA, encoding manganese-containing SOD ([Mn]-SOD), has been cloned from a virulent strain of Haemophilus influenzae type b using degenerate oligonucleotides encoding regions of the gene conserved across different bacterial species. The gene product has been identified as [MN]-SOD by its similarity at key amino acid residues to known examples of the enzyme, by expression of enzymatically active protein from cloned DNA expressed in Escherichia coli, and by demonstration that an in-frame deletion in the gene abolishes this activity. In contrast to the situation in E. coli, this [Mn]-SOD is the only active SOD detected in H. influenzae. In further contrast to E. coli, [Mn]-SOD gene expression in H. influenzae has been found to be only partially repressed under anaerobic conditions. When expressed in E. coli the gene is regulated by Fur and Fnr, and the promoter region, identified experimentally, has been found to contain nucleotide sequence motifs similar to the Fur- and Fnr-binding sequences of E. coli, suggesting the involvement of analogues of these aerobiosis-responsive activators in H. influenzae gene expression.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DV-7751a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - We compared the in vitro antibacterial activity of DV-7751a against gram-positive and -negative bacteria with those of quinolones currently available. MICs for 90% of the strains tested (MIC90s) against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.20, 0.39, 0.20, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. Moreover, MIC50s for DV-7751a against ofloxacin-resistant methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-fold lower than those for tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. DV-7751a inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Peptostreptococcus spp. at 0.39, 0.39, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively, and was 4- to > 16-fold more active against enterococci at the MIC90 level than the other quinolones tested. The activity of DV-7751a against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin at the MIC90 level and was two- to fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin. DV-7751a showed activity comparable to those of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against the other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90s of 0.025, 0.20, and 0.10 micrograms/ml, respectively). DV-7751a activity was not affected by medium, inoculum size, or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions and in human urine, as were the other quinolones tested. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated the rapid bactericidal action of DV-7751a against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and P. aeruginosa. The frequency of spontaneous resistance to DV-7751a was less than or equal to those of the reference drugs. DV-7751a inhibited the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrases from S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa at concentrations comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin.
TI  - Erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin: use of frequency distribution curves, scattergrams, and regression analyses to compare in vitro activities and describe cross-resistance.
AB  - MICs of erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin for 852 recent clinical isolates were determined by broth microdilution methods. Frequency distribution curves, scattergrams, and regression analyses were used to compare in vitro activities and describe cross-resistance. Clarithromycin was the most active drug against Bacteroides spp. but the least active against Haemophilus influenzae. Azithromycin was most active against H. influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pasteurella multocida, and Fusobacterium spp. but the least active against Streptococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. All three drugs had equivalent activities against Staphylococcus spp. and gram-positive anaerobes. None of the three drugs was particularly active against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae or nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli, although concentrations of 4 micrograms of azithromycin per ml inhibited some strains of the family Enterobacteriaceae (particularly Escherichia coli and Citrobacter diversus) and Acinetobacter baumannii. Although relative drug activities varied by organism, organisms relatively susceptible to one were relatively susceptible to all and organisms relatively resistant to one were relatively resistant to all; an exception was fusobacteria, which were usually susceptible only to azithromycin. Cross-susceptibility and cross-resistance were, therefore, the rule (except for Fusobacterium spp.), although the percentage of susceptible organisms could be varied considerably on the basis of the selection of breakpoints.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - In order evaluate antimicrobial activities of cefodizime (CDZM), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) of CDZM and other control drugs were determined against various clinical isolates, that were sent to our center from nation-wide medical institutions or were isolated and identified in our laboratory from various specimens of infected patients. The followings are a summary of the results: 1. Bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to cephems including CDZM included Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter diversus, most of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Some strains of Klebsiella oxytoca were resistant to cephems increases in beta-lactams resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and cephem resistant Escherichia coli seemed likely. Among Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Providencia spp. belonging to a category of so-called "mildly toxic bacteria", high portions of the strains examined were resistant to cephems including CDZM and these strains were also resistant to new quinolones, thus they showed multiple drug resistance. 2. MIC90's of CDZM against Streptococcus spp., H. infleunzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and P. mirabilis, frequently found in daily treatment of infections, were less than < or = 0.025 to 1.56 micrograms/ml. This indicates that CDZM would be expected to have enough antibiotic activity in infections caused by above mentioned bacteria. However, cautions are needed in the treatment of infections by beta-lactam resistant S. pneumoniae, cephem resistant E. coli and cephem resistant K. oxytoca with CDZM. 3. Among the above mentioned "mildly toxic bacteria", many multiple drug resistant strains exist. Therefore, we evaluated an usefulness of concomitant use of CDZM with aminoglycosides in the treatment of infections by these bacteria, using other reports which indicates the usefulness in vitro and in vivo. 4. Antibacterial activities of CDZM we observed in this study seem to indicate that CDZM concentrations in infected areas are maintained at above MIC levels for relatively long periods of time.
TI  - Cerebrospinal fluid osmolal changes in bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Sixty children with acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) were prospectively studied for their serum sodium values and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), serum and urinary osmolality. The results have been compared with 20 age and nutritionally matched controls. Even though mean serum osmolality (283.2 +/- 13.84 mOsm/kg) and serum sodium levels (130.5 +/- 8.15 mEq/L) were significantly lower in ABM in comparison to controls (p < 0.05 and < 0.001, respectively), the overall mean CSF osmolality in patients with ABM (282.5 +/- 12.3 mOsm/kg) was not significantly different as compared to controls (288.2 +/- 7.89 mOsm/kg). As expected, cases of ABM with syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) had significantly lower CSF osmolality (272 +/- 9.42 mOsm/kg) as compared to those without SIADH (288.5 +/- 9.34 mOsm/kg) and controls (288.2 +/- 7.89 mOsm/kg). However, our observations indicate that whereas the mean CSF osmolality was lower than the serum osmolality in the control group as well as in ABM without SIADH, it was greater than serum osmolality in ABM with SIADH (p < 0.05). Our results suggest that in the presence of SIADH, hypo-osmolality of serum may eventually result in hypo-osmolality of CSF, but the fall in CSF osmolality is not of the same degree as that of serum. Low CSF osmolality was observed to be associated with an unfavorable prognosis (p < 0.05).
TI  - Cloning and molecular analysis of the galE gene of Neisseria meningitidis and its role in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis.
AB  - The galE gene from Haemophilus influenzae was used as a hybridization probe for the galE gene of Neisseria meningitidis Group B, identifying two different homologous loci. Each of the loci was cloned and nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that both loci contained sequences similar to galE. One contained a functional galE gene and mapped to the capsule biosynthetic locus. The second contained only a partial galE-coding sequence, which did not express a functional gene product. A galE mutant meningococcal strain was constructed by transformation with an inactivated galE gene. Analysis of the LPS from the galE mutant strain revealed an apparent reduction in molecular weight and a loss of reactivity with monoclonal antibodies specific for structures known to contain galactose. These results are consistent with an essential role for galE in the incorporation of galactose into meningococcal lipopolysaccharide.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in infants and children in southern Taiwan: emphasis on Haemophilus influenzae type B infection.
AB  - During a four-year period from November 1988 to October 1992, 41 cases of bacterial meningitis with a positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture and/or CSF antigen test were collected at the National Cheng Kung University Hospital. The ages of the subjects ranged from 32 days to 13 years, with a median of seven months. The male to female ratio was 2.4:1. The most common causative agent was Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib, 29.3%), followed by group B beta-hemolytic streptococci (GBS, 24.4%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (22.0%), Escherichia coli (4.9%), Neisseria meningitidis (4.9%), Salmonella species (4.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.6%), and viridans streptococci (2.6%). The onset of GBS meningitis was always prior to four months of age. Of the 41 cases studied, 27 (65.9%) were aged from two months to five years; 12 (44.4%) of these had meningitis caused by Hib. Most of the cases (90.2%) had a fever as the first clinical manifestation. Ampicillin combined with a third-generation cephalosporin was effective against most of the causative pathogens. The most frequently encountered short-term sequelae were seizures (64.7%), subdural effusion (55.9%) and ventriculomegaly (44.1%). Observations on long-term sequelae are ongoing. While the case-fatality rate was as high as 33.3% in S. pneumoniae, and 25% in Hib-infected patients, the overall mortality rate was 17.1%. There is a need for greater emphasis on prevention through the use of available vaccines, including the newly introduced conjugate vaccines against Hib which are capable of eliciting immune responses in infants as young as two months.
TI  - Quality control guidelines for cefdinir, cefepime, cefetamet, cefmetazole, cefpodoxime, cefprozil, and clinafloxacin (CI-960) for various National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards susceptibility testing methods. Quality Control Study Group.
AB  - Several multilaboratory studies to determine quality control (QC) ranges for a variety of National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) susceptibility tests are summarized. Replicate testing used multiple lots of media and antimicrobial disks in accordance with NCCLS recommendations, including the appropriate medium modifications for tests with Haemophilus spp. and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. QC ranges for MIC and disk diffusion testing of N. gonorrhoeae ATCC 49226 were proposed for cefepime, cefetamet, cefmetazole, and cefpodoxime. Disk diffusion QC ranges for Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247 or ATCC 49766 were recommended with cefepime, cefetamet (10- and 30-microgram disks), cefmetazole, cefpodoxime, and cefprozil. Disk diffusion QC ranges for Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 with cefdinir and clinafloxacin and those for Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 with clinafloxacin were also proposed.
TI  - Molecular analysis of region 1 of the Escherichia coli K5 antigen gene cluster: a region encoding proteins involved in cell surface expression of capsular polysaccharide.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of region 1 of the K5 antigen gene cluster of Escherichia coli was determined. This region is postulated to encode functions which, at least in part, participate in translocation of polysaccharide across the periplasmic space and onto the cell surface. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed five genes that encode proteins with predicted molecular masses of 75.7, 60.5, 44, 43, and 27 kDa. The 27-kDa protein was 70.7% homologous to the CMP-2-keto-3-deoxyoctulosonic acid synthetase enzyme encoded by the E. coli kdsB gene, indicating the presence of a structural gene for a similar enzyme within the region 1 operon. The 43-kDa protein was homologous to both the Ctrb and BexC proteins encoded by the Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae capsule gene clusters, respectively, indicating common stages in the expression of capsules in these gram-negative bacteria. However, no homology was detected between the 75.7, 60.5-, and 44-kDa proteins and any of the proteins so far described for the H. influenzae and N. meningitidis capsule gene clusters.
TI  - Molecular cloning and sequence of the gene for outer membrane protein P5 of Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The gene for outer membrane protein P5 of Haemophilus influenzae was identified by immunological screening of a genomic lambda EMBL3 library of the serotype b strain 1613. The gene was subcloned, and plasmid clones expressing P5 were identified by immunologic screening. The gene for outer membrane protein P5 was sequenced. The mature protein has a molecular weight of 35,628. The protein is 50% identical and 65% similar to the OmpA protein of Escherichia coli.
TI  - [The antimicrobial activity of cefteram against recently clinically detected and  isolated strains].
AB  - In order to examine antibiotic activities of cefteram (CFTM), its minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) and those of other cephem drugs were determined against clinically isolated strains received from July 1990 to June 1991 and from July 1992 to February 1993 from medical facilities throughout the country and against clinically isolated strains detected in our laboratory in samples from patients with various infectious diseases. The obtained results are summarized below. 1. No CFTM-resistant strains were found among beta-streptococci, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae or even when found, they were present in extremely low proportions. 2. It appeared that Streptococcus pneumoniae insensitive or resistant to beta-lactams, as well as cephems-resistant strains of Escherichia coli were increasing. The former included benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP) of PCG-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), and the presence of the latter suggests the possibility of the existence of "Extended broad-spectrum beta-lactamase" producing strains. The MIC's of beta-lactams against the above PISP or PRSP, and against cephems-resistant E. coli tended to be high, but those of CFTM were relatively low (in most cases). 3. Proportions of strains resistant to cephems, including CFTM among Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Providencia rettgeri were high, and in addition, the existence of these cephem resistant species suggests an increase in multiple drug resistant strains that show resistance to new quinolone drugs. 4. As mentioned above, CFTM is by no means a perfect drug or utility drug and its antimicrobial activities do not cover some recent isolates with multiple drug resistance. Except problems encountered with so-called "attenuated" strains of bacteria, increases in resistance can only be observed at a level of MIC90's, and as far as MIC80's are concerned, CFTM still is as active as before and may be used in the treatment of most infections we encounter in normal medical practices.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of sultamicillin against clinical isolates obtained from outpatients].
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for sultamicillin (SBTPC), and for other major oral beta-lactam agents against clinically isolated strains collected from outpatients during a period from August, 1992 to February, 1993, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. The ratio of penicillinase (PCase)-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus was 96.0% and that of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was 12.0%. MIC90 of SBTPC against S. aureus including MRSA was 6.25 micrograms/ml. No increasing tendency was observed for S. aureus resistant to SBTPC. 2. No resistant strains were found among Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis against penicillins (PCs) including SBTPC. But PCs and cephems (CEPs) insensitive or resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae were observed in 22.0% among all the strains of S. pneumoniae. 3. 100% of the tested both strains of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis were beta-lactamase producers. 12.0% of the tested strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 16.0% of the strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae were also beta-lactamase producers. SBTPC showed strong antimicrobial activity against most of these beta-lactamase producing strains. However, in our study of beta-lactamase productivity using plural substrates and test methods, it appeared that a part of strains of E. coli might produce beta-lactamase of "Extended broad-spectrum". MICs of SBTPC and CEPs against those strains were distributed rather in a high range. 4. The results of the study suggested that the resistant strains of S. pneumoniae against PCs and CEPs might be increasing year by year. Some of strains of E. coli, resistance against the 2 agents were observed. It is important to keep observing changes in resistance of such organisms in the future. 5. The antimicrobial activities of SBTPC against clinically isolated strains in this study indicated potential problems such as those mentioned above. It is, however, also confirmed that SBTPC shows still strong antimicrobial activities against most of beta-lactamase producing strains found in daily medical examinations. Taking into consideration of the strong activities of SBTPC against so-called indirect pathogenicity caused by beta-lactamase producing indigenous bacteria reported lately, SBTPC may be a useful antibiotic for community acquired infections in the 1990's.
TI  - In vitro activities of BAY Y3118, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and fleroxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract and soft tissue infections.
AB  - BAY Y3118 was highly active against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC for 90% of strains tested [MIC90], 0.063 micrograms/ml). For Enterococcus faecalis and Corynebacterium jeikeium, MIC90s were 4 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. BAY Y3118 was as active as ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and had potent activity against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml).
TI  - Review of in vitro activity, pharmacokinetic characteristics, safety, and clinical efficacy of cefprozil, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacokinetics, microbiology, clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerance of cefprozil, a new, broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin. DATA SOURCES: Published clinical trials and microbiologic, pharmacokinetic, and safety data were identified by MEDLINE; additional references were derived from bibliographies of these articles; microbiologic data on file were provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb. STUDY SELECTION: Only published comparative clinical trial reports are included in the review of clinical efficacy. Noncomparative clinical data pertaining to uses of cefprozil not approved by the Food and Drug Administration are not included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Data are presented on the in vitro microbiologic activity of cefprozil against 10,152 bacterial isolates, including most of the clinically important streptococci (e.g., Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae), beta-lactamase-positive and -negative Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Clostridium difficile, and numerous other gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. In clinical trials, cefprozil appears to be at least as effective as commonly used comparison agents such as cefaclor, cefixime, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Additionally, cefprozil is better tolerated than the latter two agents, especially with regard to gastrointestinal adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Cefprozil is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin that provides coverage against both gram-negative and -positive bacteria that may cause otitis media, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, skin and skin-structure infections, secondary bacterial infection of acute bronchitis, and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. The beta-lactamase stability of cefprozil appears to exceed that of other oral cephalosporins for some important pathogens. Cefprozil is used primarily for second-line treatment as less-expensive, first-line generic alternatives generally are available. Cefprozil demonstrates clinical advantages over many other orally administered beta-lactam antibiotics in terms of antimicrobial spectrum, a once- or twice-daily dosing regimen, and/or reduced incidence of adverse effects.
TI  - [The bactericidal effect of oxybuprocaine. A possible cause of false negative results in bronchoalveolar lavage].
AB  - New approaches in the diagnosis of pneumonia, especially in intensive care units, are quantitative cultures of bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid or the protected specimen brush. The sensitivity of these methods, however, has often been found to be as low as 50-60%. One possible explanation for the low sensitivity of these diagnostic tools is the antimicrobial activity of local anaesthetics used in bronchoscopy. Therefore, we investigated the bactericidal properties of oxybuprocaine, a topical anaesthetic used for bronchoscopy in our clinic, in order to test the reliability of specimens obtained from BAL. METHODS. The bactericidal activity of oxybuprocaine in concentrations of 1%, 0.1%, 0.05% and 0.01% was tested by constructing time-kill curves for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Five stains of each bacterial species were tested. The inoculum size was 10(4) ml, and bacteria were counted after 10, 20, 30, 60 and 120 min. RESULTS. The resulting time-kill curves are demonstrated in Figs. 1-4. The most sensitive bacteria were S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, in which significant bactericidal activity could be shown even with a 0.01% solution of oxybuprocaine. E. coli and P. aeruginosa were also inhibited, but only at the highest concentration of 1%. CONCLUSIONS. The use of local anaesthetics before material is taken for culture, e.g. from BAL, may give rise to false-negative results and should therefore be avoided or reduced. For each local anaesthetic used in bronchoscopy, the concentrations that can be used without the risk of false-negative results should be determined.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the Haemophilus influenzae mutB gene.
AB  - The Haemophilus influenzae mutB+ gene complements Escherichia coli uvrD mutants.  The E. coli uvrD+ gene complements H. influenzae mutB1 mutants.
TI  - The outer membranes of Brucella spp. are not barriers to hydrophobic permeants.
AB  - The patterns of susceptibility to hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs and the uptake of the fluorescent probe N-phenyl-naphthylamine in Brucella spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and deep rough Salmonella minnesota mutants were compared. The results show that the outer membranes of smooth and naturally rough Brucella spp. do not represent barriers to hydrophobic permeants and that this absence of a barrier relates at least in part to the properties of Brucella lipopolysaccharide.
TI  - The North American component (the United States and Canada) of an International Comparative MIC trial monitoring ofloxacin resistance.
AB  - Common lots of reference MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) method reagents were used to monitor ofloxacin, a newer fluoroquinolone, and 13 other drugs against 3200 recent clinical isolates in February-April 1992. Five medical centers in the United States and Canada contributed 640 strains per facility as follows: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Klebsiella spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (100 strains each); Streptococcus pneumoniae (40 strains); and Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis (20 strains each). Quality-control strains were processed concurrently, MICs recorded, and data processed at a common location. Selected ofloxacin-resistant isolates were retested at a reference laboratory to confirm resistances and determine cross-resistant patterns. Results indicate the following (a) fluoroquinolones were superior in usable spectrum of activity to other orally administered drugs (for example, cefaclor, cefixime, ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, minocycline, oxacillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole); (b) ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were generally equal to gentamicin and cefotaxime against commonly isolated Gram-negative pathogens; (c) fluoroquinolone resistance was rare among enteric bacilli, pneumococci (ciprofloxacin > ofloxacin), H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis, but more common among oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and P. aeruginosa; (d) cross resistance was generally observed between ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin but was species or genus dependent; and (e) a new fluoroquinolone, levofloxacin, demonstrated promising activity against contemporary pathogens.
TI  - AmpG, a signal transducer in chromosomal beta-lactamase induction.
AB  - The chromosomal ampC beta-lactamase in Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae is inducible by beta-lactam antibiotics. When an inducible ampC gene is introduced on a plasmid into Escherichia coli together with its transcriptional regulator ampR, the plasmid-borne beta-lactamase is still inducible. We have isolated mutants, containing alterations in a novel E. coli gene, ampG, in which a cloned C. freundii ampC gene is unable to respond to beta-lactam inducers. The ampG gene was cloned, sequenced and mapped to minute 9.6 on the E. coli chromosome. The deduced amino acid sequence predicted AmpG to be a 53 kDa, transmembrane protein, which we propose acts as a signal transducer or permease in the beta-lactamase induction system. Immediately upstream of ampG there is another 579-base-pair-long open reading frame (ORF) encoding a putative lipoprotein shown to be non-essential for beta-lactamase induction. We have found that ampG and this ORF form an operon, whose promoter is located in front of the ORF. Located closely upstream of the putative promoter is the morphogene bolA, which is transcribed in the opposite orientation. However, using transcription fusions, we have found that the ampG transcription is not regulated by bolA. In addition, we show that transcription is probably not regulated by either the starvation specific sigma factor RpoS, which controls bolA, or by AmpD the negative regulator for ampC transcription.
TI  - Characterization of pilQ, a new gene required for the biogenesis of type 4 fimbriae in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Type 4 fimbriae are produced by a variety of pathogens, in which they appear to function in adhesion to epithelial cells, and in a form of surface translocation called twitching motility. Using transposon mutagenesis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we have identified a new locus required for fimbrial assembly. This locus contains the gene pilQ which encodes a 77 kDa protein with an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence characteristic of secretory proteins. pilQ mutants lack the spreading colony morphology characteristic of twitching motility, are devoid of fimbriae, and are resistant to the fimbrial-specific bacteriophage PO4. The pilQ gene was mapped to Spel fragment 2, which is located at 0-5 minutes on the P. aeruginosa PAO1 chromosome, and thus it is not closely linked to the previously characterized pilA-D, pilS,R or pilT genes. The pilQ region also contains ponA, aroK and aroB-like genes in an organization very similar to that of corresponding genes in Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae. The predicted amino acid sequence of PilQ shows homology to the PulD protein of Klebsiella oxytoca and related outer membrane proteins which have been found in association with diverse functions in other species including protein secretion, DNA uptake and assembly of filamentous phage. PilQ had the highest overall homology to an outer membrane antigen from Neisseria gonorrhoeae, encoded by omc, that may fulfil the same role in type 4 fimbrial assembly in this species.
TI  - Analysis of tandem, multiple genes encoding 30-kDa membrane proteins in Pasteurella haemolytica A1.
AB  - A number of outer membrane proteins (OMPs), including a 30-kDa protein, may be important in eliciting immunity to Pasteurella haemolytica A1, the causative agent of bovine pneumonic pasteurellosis. To better understand the nature of the 30-kDa antigen, several genes encoding this protein were sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed that three separate genes encoding similar, yet distinct, versions of the 30-kDa protein are tandemly arranged on the P. haemolytica A1 chromosome. The genes appear to be transcribed from a single promoter. The deduced amino acid sequences of the proteins encoded by these genes are similar to a 28-kDa inner membrane lipoprotein of Escherichia coli and a 28-kDa membrane protein which may contribute to the virulence of Haemophilus influenzae type b strains.
TI  - Protein D of Haemophilus influenzae is not a universal immunoglobulin D-binding protein.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae type b and nontypeable H. influenzae have been reported to bind human immunoglobulin D (IgD). IgD myeloma sera from five patients were tested for the ability of IgD to bind to H. influenzae. Serotype b strains bound human IgD in four of the five sera tested. IgD in the fifth serum bound strongly to type b strain MinnA but poorly to other type b strains. Additionally, IgD binding was not observed when nontypeable strains were tested. The gene for protein D, the putative IgD-binding protein, was cloned from the IgD-binding H. influenzae type b strain MinnA and expressed in Escherichia coli. IgD binding to E. coli expressing protein D was not demonstrable. Recombinant protein D was purified, and antisera were generated in rabbits. Using these rabbit sera, we detected protein D in nontypeable as well as serotype b strains by Western blotting (immunoblotting). In contrast, IgD myeloma protein 4490, which was previously reported to bind to protein D by Ruan and coworkers (M. Ruan, M. Akkoyunlu, A. Grubb, and A. Forsgren, J. Immunol. 145:3379-3384), bound strongly to both type b and nontypeable H. influenzae as well as to E. coli expressing protein D. Thus, IgD binding is a general property of H. influenzae type b strains but not a general property of nontypeable strains, although both type b and nontypeable strains produce protein D. With the exception of IgD myeloma protein 4490 binding, we have no evidence for a role of protein D in IgD binding to H. influenzae.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding a 31-kilodalton antigen of Haemophilus somnus.
AB  - Immunoblots using bovine antibody against Haemophilus somnus as the primary antibody consistently identified 31-, 40- and 78-kDa proteins in Sarkosyl-insoluble extracts of H. somnus. A genomic library of H. somnus 8025 DNA was constructed in plasmid pUC19, and 45 recombinants expressed proteins which were recognized by bovine antiserum in Western blots (immunoblots). Ten of the recombinants expressing a 31-kDa protein caused the lysis of bovine erythrocytes. Restriction endonuclease mapping indicated that the hemolytic recombinants shared an approximately 1.7-kb BglII fragment. Southern blot analysis using the BglII fragment as a probe revealed homology among the recombinants and the presence of an identically sized BglII fragment in the chromosome of all H. somnus isolates tested. Sequence analysis indicated the presence of an 822-bp open reading frame within the 1.7-kb BglII fragment. Deletion of this open reading frame resulted in the loss of hemolytic activity and protein expression in recombinant Escherichia coli, suggesting the possible role of the 31-kDa protein as a hemolysin. An amino acid sequence deduced from the DNA sequence shared homology with outer membrane protein A of E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Shigella dysenteriae, with P6 of Haemophilus influenzae, and with PIII of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. An amino acid analysis of the recombinant 31-kDa protein agreed with the amino acid composition deduced from the DNA sequence.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequence of frpC, a second gene from Neisseria meningitidis encoding a protein similar to RTX cytotoxins.
AB  - Neisseria meningitidis FAM20 has recently been shown to produce two Fe-regulated  proteins (FrpA and FrpC) related to the RTX family of cytotoxins. Here we report the cloning and DNA sequence of the locus containing the gene encoding the larger meningococcal RTX protein FrpC. FrpC was highly similar to FrpA throughout much of the predicted protein, with two main differences. Whereas the FrpA protein had 13 copies of the nine-amino-acid repeat units typical of RTX proteins, FrpC had 43 copies. The additional copies in FrpC apparently arose from a threefold tandem amplification of a 600bp DNA fragment encoding the repeats. In addition, the frpC gene lacked good promoter consensus sequences. An open reading frame (ORF1) of unknown function was found immediately upstream of frpC, suggesting the possibility that frpC was cotranscribed with ORF1. A probable promoter was found 300bp upstream of ORF1, and it contained a Fur protein-binding sequence found in the promoters of Fe-regulated Escherichia coli genes. DNA upstream of the ORF1/frpC promoter was homologous to IS1016-like elements surrounding capsulation loci of strains of Haemophilus influenzae. A FrpC-like protein (reactive in immunoblots with monoclonal antibody 9D4; multiple reactive bands of about 200 to 120 kDa) was found in five out of eight meningococcal strains but only in one out of 14 other Neisseria, suggesting that FrpC may participate in the pathogenesis of meningococcal disease.
TI  - comF, a Bacillus subtilis late competence locus, encodes a protein similar to ATP-dependent RNA/DNA helicases.
AB  - We have sequenced and genetically characterized comF, a Bacillus subtilis competence locus, previously identified by Tn917 transposon insertion mutagenesis. Expression of the locus, in which three open reading frames (ORFs) were found, is driven by a single sigma A-like promoter in front of comFORF1 and is dependent on early regulatory competence genes and only expressed in competence medium. The predicted amino acid sequences of two of the ORFs showed similarities to known proteins in the GenBank and SwissProt databases: ComFORF1 is similar to an extensive family of ATP-dependent RNA/DNA helicases with closer similarity to the DEAD protein subfamily and to the PriA protein in Escherichia coli. The latter is a DNA translocase/helicase required for primosome assembly at the replication fork of phage phi X174. ComFORF3 is 22% identical to Com101, a protein required for genetic competence in Haemophilus influenzae, a naturally competent Gram-negative bacterium. In-frame comFORF1 deletions were 1000-fold deficient in transformability compared to the wild-type, whereas disruptions of the other two ORFs were only five- to 10-fold lower. These observations allow us to hypothesize that the ComFORF1 late gene product plays an essential role during the binding and uptake events involved in Bacillus subtilis transformation.
TI  - Protein D, a putative immunoglobulin D-binding protein produced by Haemophilus influenzae, is glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase.
AB  - Protein D of Haemophilus influenzae is 67% identical to the periplasmic glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase of Escherichia coli. Extracts prepared from E. coli expressing recombinant protein D had an 8- to 22-fold-higher specific activity of glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase compared with extracts of E. coli not expressing protein D.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefditoren pivoxil in children].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefditoren pivoxil (CDTR-PI, ME 1207) were performed in children. The results were as follows: 1. A total of 18 patients (19 infections) were treated with CDTR-PI. The doses ranged 2.1-3.2 mg/kg, and it was orally administered 3 times daily, for 4-10 days. Clinical efficacies of CDTR-PI in 18 patients with 19 bacterial infections (3 with tonsillitis, 1 with bronchitis, 7 with pneumonia, 1 with acute maxillary sinusitis, 4 with otitis media, 1 with urinary tract infection, 2 with skin and soft tissue infection) were evaluated as excellent in 13 infections and as good in 6 infections with an efficacy rate of 100%. Twelve causative strains of 5 species were found in 11 patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2 cases out of 3, Haemophilus influenzae in 4/4, Staphylococcus aureus in 2/2, Haemophilus parainfluenzae in 2/2 and Escherichia coli in 1/1 were eradicated. Two patients had mild diarrhea but did not need specific treatment. Severe adverse reaction was not observed in any of the 18 patients. 2. MICs of CDTR were examined against 4 clinically isolated S. pneumoniae strains. Two strains of S. pneumoniae were relatively resistant to penicillins. 3. Pharmacokinetic studies Peak serum CDTR concentrations in 3 patients were 2.38 micrograms/ml, 0.72 micrograms/ml and 2.25 micrograms/ml at a dose of CDTR-PI 3 mg/kg orally administered at 30-minute after meal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Genetic organization and sequence of the rfb gene cluster of Yersinia enterocolitica serotype O:3: similarities to the dTDP-L-rhamnose biosynthesis pathway of Salmonella and to the bacterial polysaccharide transport systems.
AB  - The Yersinia enterocolitica O:3 lipopolysaccharide O-antigen is a homopolymer of  6-deoxy-L-altrose. The cloned rfb region was sequenced, and 10 open reading frames were identified. Transposon mutagenesis, deletion analysis and transcomplementation experiments showed that eight of the genes, organized into two operons, rfbABC and rfbDEFGH, are essential for O-antigen synthesis. Functional tandem promoters were identified upstream of both operons. Of the deduced polypeptides RfbA, RfbF and RfbG were similar to Salmonella proteins involved in the dTDP-L-rhamnose biosynthesis. Rhamnose and 6-deoxy-L-altrose are C3-epimers suggesting that analogous pathways function in their biosynthesis. RfbD and RfbE were similar to capsular polysaccharide export proteins, e.g. KpsM and KpsT of Escherichia coli. This and transposon mutagenesis showed that RfbD and RfbE function as O-antigen exporters.
TI  - Composition of the peptidoglycan of Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The composition of the peptidoglycan of Haemophilus influenzae was determined by  analyzing glycopeptides generated by M1 muramidase hydrolysis using high pressure liquid chromatography, fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, and fast atom bombardment collisionally activated dissociation tandem mass spectrometry, and amino acid analysis. The structures of 17 glycopeptides, representing 96% of the total peptidoglycan, were ascertained. Fifteen glycopeptides resembled species described for Escherichia coli peptidoglycan (Glauner, B., and Schwarz, U. (1983) The Target of Penicillin (Hackenbeck, R., ed), Walter de Gruyter, Berlin pp. 29-34) as compared with 9 in common with Bordetella pertussis (Tuomanen, E., Schwartz, J., Sande, S., Light, K., and Gage, D. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 11093-11098). Substitutions for L-alanine in the fourth position of the stem peptide included glycine, aspartic acid, and serine. The peptidoglycan was 27% cross-linked, 2% of which formed between diaminopimelic acid residues. No species was identified containing lysyl-arginine residues characteristic of lipoprotein. The peptidoglycan of non-beta-lactamase-mediated antibiotic-resistant H. influenzae differed from that of sensitive strains by an increase in the amount of disaccharide tripeptides and a decrease in 1,6-anhydro dimers. Both changes were transformable properties that changed in a stepwise fashion in parallel with the degree of antibiotic resistance.
TI  - [A nationwide survey of antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics in Japan (1988-1990)].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  antibacterial agents at 149 hospitals throughout Japan from September to December in both 1989 and 1990. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testings were performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci showed high or moderate resistance rates to beta-lactam antibiotics, but Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were highly susceptible to them. Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to imipenem (IPM) and piperacillin but resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides. Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs and aminoglycosides. Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa had a good susceptibility to IPM and aminoglycosides. Bacteroides fragilis was highly susceptible to IPM. IPM had strong antibacterial activity to many species of clinical isolates, including strains which were resistant to commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - Bacteraemia and fungaemia in an Australian general hospital--associations and outcomes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To obtain a comprehensive overview of bacteraemia and fungaemia in a general hospital and thus to determine the incidence, primary sites of sepsis, organisms involved and associated mortality. DESIGN: A prospective laboratory and clinical evaluation of all episodes where microorganisms were cultured from blood over one year. SETTING: The two major hospitals in the Australian Capital Territory which have both community and referral functions. These hospitals provide obstetric and paediatric services along with adult medicine and surgery. PATIENTS: All those who acquired bacteraemia in hospital or presented with a blood-stream infection documented by a positive blood culture. RESULTS: During 1990, 474 clinical episodes of bacteraemia or fungaemia were detected in 446 patients. Significant isolates were identified in 317 of these episodes. The incidence of significant sepsis was 8.1 episodes per 1000 admissions. The most common organisms isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (75 episodes) and Escherichia coli (70 episodes). One hundred and twenty-eight episodes were hospital acquired. Intravenous catheters were the primary sites of sepsis in 68 episodes. Fifty patients died. Higher mortality rates were associated with patients over 60 years of age, respiratory tract sepsis, endocarditis and the presence of an underlying malignancy. CONCLUSION: Bacteraemia and fungaemia are common problems. Nosocomial bacteraemia accounted for 40% of episodes. Half of these nosocomial infections were iatrogenic. Many of the episodes of intravenous catheter sepsis were potentially preventable. Ongoing programs of surveillance of bacteraemia, with the evaluation of primary site, associated features and mortality, are essential to monitor the dimensions of this problem and aid in implementing effective preventive strategies.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of empyema. A retrospective review in two military hospitals.
AB  - The microbiology and clinical features of empyema were studied retrospectively in 197 patients whose specimens yielded bacterial growth after inoculation for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Three hundred forty-three organisms (216 aerobic or facultative and 127 anaerobic organisms) were isolated. Aerobic bacteria were isolated in 127 (64 percent) patients, anaerobic bacteria in 25 (13 percent), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 45 (23 percent). The predominant aerobic or facultative organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae (70 isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (58), Escherichia coli (17), Klebsiella pneumoniae (16), and Haemophilus influenzae (12). The predominant anaerobes were pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas species (24), Bacteroides fragilis group (22), anaerobic cocci (36), and Fusobacterium species (20). beta-Lactamase-producing organisms were recovered in 49 (38 percent) of 128 tested specimens. These included all 42 tested S aureus and 15 B fragilis group, 4 of 9 K pneumoniae, 3 of 9 H influenzae, 3 of 8 pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas species, and 2 of 6 E coli. Most patients from whom S pneumoniae and H influenzae were recovered had pneumonia, and most patients with S aureus had pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, and lung abscesses. The recovery of anaerobic bacteria was mostly associated with the concomitant diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia, and lung, subdiaphragmatic, dental, and oropharyngeal abscesses. These data highlight the importance of anaerobic bacteria in selected cases of empyema.
TI  - Isolation, expression, and nucleotide sequencing of the pilin structural gene of  the Brazilian purpuric fever clone of Haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegyptius.
AB  - In this study we isolated the pilin gene from the Brazilian purpuric fever (BPF)  clone of Haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegyptius, expressed the gene in Escherichia coli, and determined its nucleotide sequence. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the BPF pilin gene with the sequences of pilin genes from strains of H. influenzae sensu stricto demonstrated a high degree of identity. Consistent with this observation, hemagglutination inhibition studies performed with a series of glycoconjugates indicated that BPF pili and H. influenzae type b pili possess the same erythrocyte receptor specificity.
TI  - An assay for DNA photolyases using non-radioactive DNA and restriction enzymes.
AB  - Restriction enzymes, such as Eco RI, Hind III, etc., which have a potential pyrimidine dimer site in their recognition sequence, fail to cleave DNA if their recognition site is modified by the formation of pyrimidine dimers as a result of UV irradiation of DNA (J. E. Cleaver, J. Mol. Biol., 170 (1983) 305-317). We have made use of this functional property of restriction enzymes to develop a rapid and sensitive assay for DNA photolyases. UV-irradiated plasmid pBR322 DNA is only partially digested when incubated with a single site enzyme Hind III even at high concentration (20 units (micrograms DNA)-1). The amount of DNA not cleaved by Hind III is determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. The effect of UV irradiation is reversed by the photoreactivation of DNA. The decrease in the amount of Hind III-resistant DNA on treatment with photolyase gives a measure of the enzymatic activity of the photolyase preparation. The advantage of using non-radioactive DNA and the high speed and simplicity of this assay make it especially suitable for use in the purification of photolyases.
TI  - Investigation of the structural heterogeneity of lipooligosaccharides from pathogenic Haemophilus and Neisseria species and of R-type lipopolysaccharides from Salmonella typhimurium by electrospray mass spectrometry.
AB  - Heterogeneity in the lipooligosaccharides (LOS) of pathogenic Haemophilus and Neisseria species is evident from the multiplicity of components observed with electrophoretic analyses. Knowledge of the precise structures that make up these diverse LOS molecules is clearly the key to reaching an understanding of pathogenic processes such as phase variation and molecular mimicry. Except for a few cases, little is known about the specific structural features of LOS that underlie phase variation and molecular mimicry, partly because of the inherent difficulties in the structural elucidation of these complex glycolipids. In the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, rough, or R-type, mutants have been isolated that have provided insight into the biosynthetic pathways and associated genetics that control LPS expression. Nonetheless, recent work has shown that these R-type LPS are more complex than originally thought, and significant heterogeneity is still observed, primarily in their phosphorylation states. In order to investigate the structures of LPS and LOS in a more rapid fashion, we have determined the precise molecular weights of LOS (and LPS) preparations from various Haemophilus, Neisseria, and Salmonella species by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. The LOS (or LPS) were first O-deacylated under mild hydrazine conditions to remove O-linked esters primarily from the lipid A portion. Under negative-ion conditions, the O-deacylated LOS yield abundant multiply deprotonated molecular ions, (M-nH)n-, where n refers to the number of protons removed and therefore determines the absolute charge state, n = z. Mass spectra from different LOS and LPS preparations have provided detailed information concerning the structural basis for LOS (and LPS) heterogeneity and corresponding saccharide compositions. The identification of sialic acid in the LOS of Haemophilus and Neisseria species and the variable phosphorylation of the core of S. typhimurium LPS have afforded insights into the biosynthetic pathways used by these organisms. Information of this type is important for understanding the underlying genetic and environmental factors controlling LOS and LPS expression.
TI  - Loracarbef. A review of its antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic efficacy.
AB  - Loracarbef is an orally administered member of a new synthetic class of beta-lactam antibiotics, the carbacephems, which is characterised by enhanced chemical stability. At low concentrations (< 2 mg/L) in vitro, it inhibits Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, beta-haemolytic streptococci groups B, C and G. Proteus mirabilis and Moraxella catarrhalis, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. At therapeutic plasma concentrations it is also active in vitro against most strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. saprophyticus, Escherichia coli and beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains of Haemophilus influenzae. Like other beta-lactams, loracarbef is inactive against methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus. When administered at dosages of 200 to 400 mg twice daily, the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of loracarbef is comparable with that of amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in patients with upper or lower respiratory tract infections, and comparable with that of cefaclor in treating infections of the lower respiratory tract, skin and skin structures and urinary tract. Loracarbef and phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V) were equally effective in treating streptococcal pharyngitis and tonsillitis. Loracarbef is generally well tolerated by all age groups and causes less diarrhoea than amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. It is administered twice daily. It offers a suitable alternative to other orally administered antibiotics for the treatment of mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible organisms.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of aspoxicillin of fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - The Antimicrobial activity of aspoxicillin (ASPC) in terms of minimum inhibitory  concentration (MICs) was compared with those of other penicillin antibiotics (PCs) against clinical isolates sent to us from medical institutions throughout Japan in 1988, 1990 and 1992 and strains isolated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections. 1. The MIC80's of ASPC against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis group were almost the same as those against these isolates in 1985 to 1986. 2. A trend for increasing susceptibility to PCs including ASPC was observed in the isolates of S. aureus and Haemophilus influenzae. This trend in S. aureus was attributed to the appearance of non beta-lactamase producing strains associated with the development of highly resistant strains among the methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) as well as to a tendency toward yearly decreasing frequency of MRSA. The trend for the increased susceptibility in H. influenzae was related to the decrease in the number of beta-lactamase production strains. 3. The frequency of the strains highly resistant to PCs including ASPC increased. 4. No PCs-resistant strains were observed among the so-called beta-streptococci, while among alpha-streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae there was a trend for decreasing frequency of strains with lower susceptibility to PCs or those with resistant to PCs. These strains may be variants which were also resistant to cephems and had penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Meanwhile, a high frequency of highly PCs-resistant strains were noted among Enterococcus faecium. In view of the fact that the PCs-resistance of E. faecium is known to be related to PBPs, the pattern of the susceptibility of the recent clinical isolates to beta-lactams is considered to be multimodal.
TI  - Serological cross-reactions between Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis and other oropharyngeal bacteria.
AB  - Oropharyngeal bacteria belonging to different species were tested for serological cross-reactions with Moraxella catarrhalis using sera from immunized rabbits. Sera were tested using immunofluorescence, an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and immunoblotting. On immunofluorescence, significant cross-reactions were demonstrated with beta-hemolytic streptococci group A and group G, as well as with streptococci of the viridans group. Some cross-reactions were also noted with Neisseria meningitidis. In the EIA, strong cross-reactions were demonstrated with beta-hemolytic streptococci. No cross-reactions were obtained with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae or common oral Neisseria. The results are of importance for the interpretation of serological tests to detect infections with Moraxella catarrhalis, and for the development of methods for detection of antigens in samples from the respiratory tract.
TI  - Correlating infectious outcome with clinical parameters of 1130 consecutive febrile infants aged zero to eight weeks.
AB  - The study objectives were to characterize the infectious outcomes and associated  clinical parameters of a large group of febrile young infants who received outpatient sepsis evaluation. This retrospective review of consecutive cases during a seven-year period was set in an urban pediatric emergency department. Febrile infants, aged zero to eight weeks, were the participants. All received a standard evaluation for sepsis, including complete blood count/blood culture, lumbar puncture/cerebrospinal fluid culture, and urinalysis/urine culture. Of 1130 patients, 447 (42%) were aged zero to four weeks, and 683 (58%) were aged four to eight weeks. In 96 cases (8.5%), a bacterial pathogen was isolated by culture of cerebrospinal fluid, blood, urine, or stool; 58% were aged zero to four weeks and 42% were aged four to eight weeks. The rate of positive cultures per patient age was doubled in those aged zero to four weeks (12%) compared with those aged four to eight weeks (6%). The 49 cases of invasive bacterial infections (bacterial meningitis/bacteremia) were most commonly associated with lower degrees of fever, as slightly over one half (25/49) had temperature < 39 degrees C. The most common pathogens of invasive bacterial infection were group B streptococcus and Escherichia coli, accounting for 33 of 49 cases (67%); the most common pathogens of invasive bacterial infection in older children (Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were relatively underrepresented, accounting for only five of these 49 (10%) cases.
TI  - High-molecular-weight proteins of nontypable Haemophilus influenzae mediate attachment to human epithelial cells.
AB  - Nontypable Haemophilus influenzae are Gram-negative bacilli that represent a common cause of human disease. These organisms initiate infection by colonizing the upper respiratory tract. Despite the essential role of colonization, the bacterial determinants of this process remain poorly defined. We recently identified a family of surface-exposed high-molecular-weight proteins of nontypable H. influenzae that are related to filamentous hemagglutinin, a critical adherence factor of Bordetella pertussis. The genes encoding the two such high-molecular-weight proteins (HMW-1 and HMW-2) expressed by a prototypic nontypable H. influenzae strain have now been cloned and sequenced. In this study we examined the role of the HMWs in adherence to human epithelial cells. We found that loss of expression of HMW-1 by the prototypic strain and a HMW-1-like protein in a heterologous nontypable H. influenzae strain markedly decreased the capacity to adhere. The absence of expression of both HMW-1 and HMW-2 in the prototypic strain or their homologs in the second strain was associated with a further decrease in adherence. Expression of either HMW-1 or HMW-2 in nonadherent laboratory strains of Escherichia coli resulted in acquisition of the adherence phenotype. These results indicate that both HMW-1 and HMW-2 and the homologous proteins from a second strain can mediate attachment. We speculate that these proteins and the related proteins in other nontypable H. influenzae isolates are important colonization factors.
TI  - The NodL and NodJ proteins from Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium strains are similar  to capsular polysaccharide secretion proteins from gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The NodL and NodJ nodulation proteins have been described in different Rhizobium  and Bradyrhizobium species. The nodLJ genes belong to the nod regulon. Other genes from this regulon are involved in the biosynthesis and modification of lipo-oligosaccharide molecule(s) which are morphogenic signals when acting on legume roots. It has been proposed that the NodL and NodJ proteins belong to a bacterial inner membrane transport system of small molecules. Nucleotide sequencing of Mudll PR13 insertions in the nodulation region of the symbiotic plasmid from a Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. phaseoli strain CE3 has revealed the presence of nodL and nodJ-related sequences downstream of nodC. Computer nucleotide sequence analysis of the entire NodL and NodJ sequences from R. leguminosarum bv. viciae and Bradyrhizobium japonicum strains show that both proteins are similar to the KpsT and KpsM proteins from Escherichia coli K1 and K5 strains, to the BexB and BexA proteins from Haemophilis influenzae and to the CtrD and CtrC proteins from Neisseria meningitidis, respectively. Except for the NodL and NodJ proteins, all of them have been involved in the mechanism of secretion of polysaccharides in each of their harbouring species. On the basis of the similarity found, we propose that the NodL and the NodJ proteins could be involved in the export of a lipo-oligosaccharide.
TI  - Efficacy of fleroxacin versus amoxicillin in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - In a multicenter study the efficacy and safety of oral fleroxacin at 400 mg once  a day and amoxicillin at 500 mg three times daily for 7 days were compared for the treatment of patients with acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to drug-susceptible bacteria. A total of 194 patients were enrolled, 102 in the fleroxacin group and 92 in the amoxicillin group. Of those enrolled, 22 in the fleroxacin group and 30 (29 for clinical efficacy) in the amoxicillin group were included in the efficacy analysis. All were included in the safety analysis. Clinical success was noted in 21 (95%) of 22 fleroxacin-treated patients and 22 (76%) of 29 amoxicillin-treated patients. Bacteriologic cure was obtained in 21 (95%) of 22 of the fleroxacin group and 18 (60%) of 30 of the amoxicillin group. One Haemophilus parainfluenzae strain persisted with fleroxacin. Persisting organisms with amoxicillin included Haemophilus influenzae (four), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (three), Escherichia coli (two), Streptococcus pneumoniae (one), Neisseria species (one), and Proteus mirabilis (one). Adverse events were reported by 41% of 102 patients receiving fleroxacin and 15% of 92 patients receiving amoxicillin. Insomnia, dizziness, and nausea occurred more frequently with fleroxacin. Fleroxacin may be indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial infection in chronic bronchitis known to be due to Haemophilus species and Moraxella catarrhalis. The 92% incidence of resistance among the S. pneumoniae isolates recovered from all enrolled patients suggests that fleroxacin may not be useful for such infections.
TI  - The ClpE protein involved in biogenesis of the CS31A capsule-like antigen is a member of a periplasmic chaperone family in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The putative chaperone-like protein ClpE, required for biogenesis of the Escherichia coli capsule-like antigen CS31A, was compared with ten known periplasmic chaperones from E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae and Yersinia pestis. The amino acid sequence alignment was superimposed onto the three-dimensional structure of the PapD chaperone of uropathogenic E. coli, and amino acid residues involved in maintaining the structure integrity of the suggested binding site were found identical in most of the 11 chaperones. Construction of a phylogenetic tree to investigate the relationship within the chaperone family has revealed interesting degrees of relatedness between the different proteins.
TI  - Bacterial infection complicating varicella infection: A 10-year review of hospitalized children.
AB  - An increased incidence of Streptococci pyogenes (group A streptococcus [GAS]) infections and rheumatic fever has been reported over the past decade. The present study was conducted to determine whether a similar increase in such infections was observed after varicella, an infection previously shown to be associated with a high incidence of streptococcal infections. The charts of all children admitted with chickenpox to the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Ontario from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 1989 were reviewed. Immunocompromised children and those hospitalized for another reason who had an incidental diagnosis of chickenpox were excluded. Twenty-five cases with bacterial infection complicating chickenpox were compared with 103 patients without secondary infection. No statistically significant differences were observed for age, gender, duration of illness prior to hospitalization or duration of hospitalization in the two groups. GAS was the most frequent isolate in the cases, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae. The types of infection were significantly different for GAS compared with other organisms, with a predominance of skin infections in the former group (chi(2) analysis, P<0.05). No increase in the incidence of GAS infections was observed over time. This study confirms the importance of GAS infections in patients with varicella, but no increase was observed in hospitalized children during the 10-year study period.
TI  - Diversity of immunoglobulin light chain usage in the human immune response to Haemophilus influenzae type b capsular polysaccharide.
AB  - The response to the capsular polysaccharide of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib PS) has been used to determine the molecular basis of antibody gene diversity in humans. In contrast to the relatively restricted nature of anti-Hib PS heavy-chain variable region gene expression, a variety of light-chain variable region genes may encode this antibody (Ab) response. Light-chain variable region gene usage appears to determine the expression of certain Ab idiotypes and fine antigen specificity. To further define the role of light-chain variable region gene usage in important anti-Hib PS Ab subgroups, we have cloned and sequenced a number of immunoglobulin light-chain variable region genes (IgVL) from human monoclonal IgA anti-Hib PS Ab generated in response to Hib PS-protein conjugate vaccines. Three of these Ab are encoded by unusual variable segments. One kappa-Ab is encoded by the "predominant" V kappa II A2 germline gene but, in contrast to a previously reported A2-encoded IgVL sequence, differs from the A2 germline sequence. The IgVL sequence of a second Ab is the only sequence of a kappa-Ab that cross-reacts with the structurally related antigen Escherichia coli K100 polysaccharide reported to date. This IgVL is encoded by a V kappa III-segment most closely homologous to the Humhv328/L16 germline gene, whereas previous reports suggested V kappa III-encoded anti-Hib PS Ab might be exclusively encoded by the germline gene Humhv325/A27.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Antibacterial activity of cefcanel.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentration of cefcanel, a new oral cephalosporin, has been determined for 182 clinical isolates, of which 84 were from the family Enterobacteriaceae, 45 were from the genus Streptococcus, 18 were nonfermentative rods, 25 were Haemophilus influenzae and 10 were Branhamella catarrhalis. In general, cefcanel was more active than the other cephalosporins against the species Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes and Proteus mirabilis. Among the genus Streptococcus only the enterococci were resistant to cefcanel. H. influenzae and B. catarrhalis showed also a reasonable susceptibility towards cefcanel. Oxidative rods were highly resistant to cefcanel.
TI  - Decimal assay for additivity of drugs permits delineation of synergy and antagonism.
AB  - Although there are many in vitro tests for drug interactions, few possess a linear, predictable dose-dependent end point or have a precise definition for additivity. Therefore, a new test with both of these features, the decimal assay for additivity, was developed. This test is based on a disk diffusion assay and the strict linear relationship between drug mass and size of the inhibition zone. When the decimal assay for additivity was applied to combinations known on a mechanistic basis to be additive, synergistic, or antagonistic, results of the new test always reflected the expected drug interaction. For example, synergy between trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole was detected in tests with Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae, as was antagonism between cefoxitin and cefotaxime in tests with Enterobacter cloacae. Quinolones plus chloramphenicol appeared to be antagonistic. In addition to correctly identifying the drug interaction, the decimal assay for additivity identified the drug ratio producing the maximal drug interaction. These results suggest that the decimal assay for additivity should prove very useful in future studies of drug interactions.
TI  - [Sulbactam/ampicillin in comparison with cefuroxime for infections of the lower respiratory tract. Results of a prospective, randomized comparative study].
AB  - In a randomized prospective study, ampicillin (AMP) in combination with the beta-lactamase-inhibitor, sulbactam (SBT) was compared with cefuroxime (CXM) in 73 hospitalized patients with lower respiratory tract infections. 36 patients received SBT/AMP 1 g/2 g t.i.d. and 37 patients received CXM 1.5 g t.i.d.--both in the form of i.v. infusion. The duration of treatment ranged from five to twelve days, with a median of eight days in each group. 23 patients (64%) of the SBT/AMP group had pneumonia, while 13 (36%) had acute purulent bronchitis; 13 of the patients (36%) received artificial respiration. 23 patients (62%) of the CXM group had pneumonia and 14 (38%) acute purulent bronchitis; eight patients (22%) required artificial respiration. In 54 patients (SBT/AMP: 26; CXM: 28) initial culture yielded bacterial pathogens, mainly Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and pneumococci. 35 patients in each group were clinically evaluable. 31 patients (89%) responded to treatment with SBT/AMP, and 28 patients (80%) to treatment with CXM. Four patients (11%) who received SBT/AMP failed to respond, as did seven patients on CXM. The bacteriological efficacy was assessed in 26 patients of the SBT/AMP group: in 22 cases (84%) baseline pathogens were eradicated, while in two patients (8%) each, there was persistent infection and a superinfection, respectively. In 23 patients (82%) of the CXM group (28 patients evaluated) the pathogens were eradicated, while three cases (11%) had persistent infection, and two (7%) superinfection. Apart from a case of exanthema under CXM, no adverse drug reactions were reported. No statistically significant differences were to be seen between the two groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Global surveillance of bacterial susceptibility to cefaclor: 1988-1990.
AB  - In vitro data on bacterial susceptibility to cefaclor were collected from clinical trials conducted in 15 European countries, South Africa, Canada, and the United States. Among the respiratory pathogens, 94% of Haemophilus influenzae, 98.6% of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 98.8% of Streptococcus pyogenes, and 98.1% of Moraxella catarrhalis were susceptible to cefaclor. Over 90% of the tested isolates of the most common urinary tract pathogen, Escherichia coli, were susceptible to cefaclor. Virtually all of the pathogens that may infect skin and soft tissues, S pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains), were cefaclor susceptible. These data confirm that the major pathogens in bacterial infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract, of the skin and related structures, and of the urinary tract remain susceptible to cefaclor after more than 13 years of widespread clinical use.
TI  - Comparison of empiric aztreonam and aminoglycoside regimens in the treatment of serious gram-negative lower respiratory infections.
AB  - An open-label, controlled, randomized study was performed to assess the efficacy  and safety of combination regimens using either aztreonam or an aminoglycoside control regimen as empiric therapy for suspected aerobic gram-negative bacillary pneumonia or purulent bronchitis. Eighty-four patients, 42 in each arm of the study, were randomly assigned to one of two treatment regimens. The combination aztreonam regimen included aztreonam, 2 gm every 8 hours (q8h), plus either clindamycin, 600 to 900 mg q8h, or nafcillin, 1.5 gm to 2 gm every 6 hours (q6h). The control regimen was one of the following depending on the combination therapy that was designated standard at each of the three study institutions: amikacin, 5 mg/kg q8h, plus cefazolin, 1 gm q8h; amikacin, 500 mg every 12 hours plus mezlocillin, 4 gm q6h; or kinetically dosed tobramycin plus ticarcillin, 3 gm to 4 gm q4h. The two groups were well matched in terms of demographics and clinical characteristics. Among the 84 patients, organisms from the Enterobacteriaceae family accounted for the largest proportion of isolates (44%) including Escherichia coli (13%), Klebsiella species (14%), and Serratia species (9%). Other commonly identified organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19%), Haemophilus influenzae (15%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (12%), and Staphylococcus aureus (8%). Results of this trial included clinical response rates of 83% in both groups (P = 0.951) and a microbiologic cure rate of 75% in the aztreonam group and 63% in the control group (P = 0.291). In the 59 patients with documented aerobic gram-negative pneumonia, microbiologic eradication rates were 72% in the aztreonam group versus 57% in the control group (P = 0.359). Duration of treatment tended to be shorter in the aztreonam group than in the control group, with a median 10 days of therapy versus 12 days of therapy (P = 0.095), respectively. In addition, the percentage of patients requiring nonstudy antimicrobial agents tended to be lower in the aztreonam group than the control group, involving 21% of patients in the aztreonam group compared with 36% of patients in the control group (P = 0.086). All regimens were well tolerated, and no patient was withdrawn because of adverse reactions to the study medications. Two patients, both in the control group, required dose reduction, which was necessitated by possible aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity. This trial shows that aztreonam is an effective agent with an excellent safety profile when used in combination regimens for the empiric treatment of pneumonia. A well-controlled trial is needed to verify the trend toward shorter hospital stays and a reduced need for additional antimicrobial agents seen with the aztreonam regimen when compared with those receiving aminoglycoside-combination regimens.
TI  - [Cefuzonam penetration into cerebrospinal fluid].
AB  - We studied the penetration of cefuzonam (CZON) into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 20 patients with neurosurgical diseases. Influences of the presence of meningeal reaction and the intensity of brain damage on CSF penetration of CZON were also examined. Concentrations of CZON in serum and CSF were determined using the thin-layer cup method before and 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after 2 g of CZON was administered intravenously. The serum concentration at 1 hour was 60.4 +/- 31.3 (mean +/- S.D.) microgram/ml, then rapidly decreased to 2.1 +/- 2.3 micrograms/ml at 6 hours. In contrast, the CSF concentration gradually increased, reached a peak level of 0.319 +/- 0.313 micrograms/ml at 4 hours and then slowly decreased to 0.273 +/- 0.249 micrograms/ml at 6 hours. The CSF penetration ration: CZON ([CSF]/[serum]) was 5.6% at 4 hours. The peak CSF concentration in patients with meningeal reaction (0.465 +/- 0.364 micrograms/ml at 2 hours) was about 2-fold higher than that in those without the reaction (0.249 +/- 0.223 micrograms/ml at 4 hours). The peak CSF concentrations in patients with slight, moderate, and severe brain damage were 0.231 +/- 0.133 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, 0.270 +/- 0.232 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, and 0.680 +/- 0.467 micrograms/ml at 2 hours, respectively. CSF penetration of CZON was augmented in patients with meningeal reaction or severe brain damage. These findings indicate that the concentration of CZON in CSF after intravenous administration is sufficient for treatment of meningitis or infections after neurosurgical operations caused by such bacteria as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Treatment recommendations for respiratory tract infections associated with aging.
AB  - Age-related changes, for example reduced elasticity and earlier airways collapse, predispose the elderly to respiratory infection. Other factors such as a lifetime of smoking, the use of hypnotics, or the development of stroke also predispose. Pneumonia becomes increasingly common with advancing age, and both morbidity and mortality increase with associated disease burden. Diagnosis of pneumonia may be more difficult in the aged because of physiological changes. However, careful physical examination with accurate, regular recording of body temperature will usually reveal the characteristic features of pneumonia, which should be confirmed by chest radiograph. In the frail elderly, the onset of impaired function, such as confusion, immobility, falling or incontinence, should raise suspicion of infection. Pneumonia is classified as community-acquired, nursing home-acquired or nosocomial, which helps in the empirical choice of antibiotics. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common organism in the community, then Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis. Gram-negative organisms like Klebsiella and Escherichia coli are more common in nosocomial infections. Nursing home patients with pneumonia tend to be more frail than those in the community. Treatment is directed at eradication of the organism with the appropriate antibiotic, maintaining hydration and oxygenation, as well as managing impaired mobility, faecal loading, urinary incontinence and confusion. Influenza vaccination is strongly recommended for the frail elderly. Tuberculosis remains an important diagnosis in the frail elderly and should always be considered, especially in patients with respiratory infection who fail to respond to conventional therapy.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
AB  - An agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. Among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. Enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Haemophilus influenzae with an MIC90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, and Legionella pneumophila with an MIC of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin inhibited Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Norfloxacin and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (MIC90) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and some other Gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. The results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against Gram-negative and Gram-positive species.
TI  - Experimental immunoglobulin A nephropathy induced by gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A study was conducted to determine whether intraperitoneal and oral administration of formalin-fixed gram-negative bacteria induced immunohistologically and ultrastructurally evident glomerular deposition of IgA and C3 in C3H/HeN mice. Separate treatments with strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and two kinds of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were used. Two mice in each treatment group were sacrificed at 10, 20 and 30 weeks of age to examine sequential glomerular changes. In addition to the intraperitoneal administration (IP) groups receiving whole formalin-fixed bacterial cells, cell precipitate and supernatant fractions of each bacterial strain after sonication were injected intraperitoneally once a week, and the mice were sacrificed at 30 weeks of age. Sequential quantitation or IgG, IgA or IgM in serum and the isotypes specific for each of the bacterial strains or LPS administered was performed by ELISA. The incidence of immunofluorescence positivity for glomerular IgA and C3 was 37-71 and 37-66.7%, respectively, in the IP groups that had received bacterial cells of each strain, which was significantly higher than that in the IP groups given LPS or in the controls. These results suggest that cell wall components common among gram-negative bacteria, other than LPS, play a major role in the glomerular deposition of IgA and C3. This is the first use of gram-negative bacteria to establish an active model of IgA nephropathy.
TI  - The antibacterial effect of halothane.
AB  
TI  - Pharmacokinetics and tissue penetration of a single dose of ceftriaxone (1,000 milligrams intravenously) for antibiotic prophylaxis in thoracic surgery.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics and tissue penetration of ceftriaxone after a single intravenous injection of 1,000 mg to 17 patients for antibiotic prophylaxis in thoracic surgery were studied. The patients were scheduled for elective noncardiac thoracic surgery. Adequate levels in serum (higher than or equal to the MIC for 90% of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were found for all patients throughout the surgical procedures. Mean maximal (5-min) and final (24-h) ceftriaxone levels in serum were 157 +/- 42 and 8.6 +/- 4.5 mg/liter, respectively. The beta-phase elimination half-life was 8.6 +/- 3 h, the plasma clearance was 18.4 +/- 6.25 ml/min, and the apparent volume of distribution at steady state was 0.21 +/- 0.07 liters/kg. At the time of the thoracotomy, the ceftriaxone concentrations were 13.5 +/- 7.8 micrograms/g in thoracic wall fat and 27 +/- 9 micrograms/g in lung tissue. At the time of closure, the ceftriaxone concentration was 15 +/- 9 micrograms/g in thoracic wall fat. During the different steps of the surgical procedures, 100% of patients had adequate levels in tissue (higher than or equal to the MIC for 90% of isolates of Streptococcus spp., E. coli, H. influenzae, and K. pneumoniae). For S. aureus, 90 to 100% of patients had adequate tissue ceftriaxone levels.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of a gene encoding a 21-kilodalton outer membrane protein  from Bordetella avium and expression of the gene in Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - Three gene libraries of Bordetella avium 197 DNA were prepared in Escherichia coli LE392 by using the cosmid vectors pCP13 and pYA2329, a derivative of pCP13 specifying spectinomycin resistance. The cosmid libraries were screened with convalescent-phase anti-B. avium turkey sera and polyclonal rabbit antisera against B. avium 197 outer membrane proteins. One E. coli recombinant clone produced a 56-kDa protein which reacted with convalescent-phase serum from a turkey infected with B. avium 197. In addition, five E. coli recombinant clones were identified which produced B. avium outer membrane proteins with molecular masses of 21, 38, 40, 43, and 48 kDa. At least one of these E. coli clones, which encoded the 21-kDa protein, reacted with both convalescent-phase turkey sera and antibody against B. avium 197 outer membrane proteins. The gene for the 21-kDa outer membrane protein was localized by Tn5seq1 mutagenesis, and the nucleotide sequence was determined by dideoxy sequencing. DNA sequence analysis of the 21-kDa protein revealed an open reading frame of 582 bases that resulted in a predicted protein of 194 amino acids. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of the gene encoding the 21-kDa outer membrane protein with protein sequences in the National Biomedical Research Foundation protein sequence data base indicated significant homology to the OmpA proteins of Shigella dysenteriae, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. coli, and Salmonella typhimurium and to Neisseria gonorrhoeae outer membrane protein III, Haemophilus influenzae protein P6, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa porin protein F. The gene (ompA) encoding the B. avium 21-kDa protein hybridized with 4.1-kb DNA fragments from EcoRI-digested, chromosomal DNA of Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella bronchiseptica and with 6.0- and 3.2-kb DNA fragments from EcoRI-digested, chromosomal DNA of B. avium and B. avium-like DNA, respectively. A 6.75-kb DNA fragment encoding the B. avium 21-kDa protein was subcloned into the Asd+ vector pYA292, and the construct was introduced into the avirulent delta cya delta crp delta asd S. typhimurium chi 3987 for oral immunization of birds. The gene encoding the 21-kDa protein was expressed equivalently in B. avium 197, delta asd E. coli chi 6097, and S. typhimurium chi 3987 and was localized primarily in the cytoplasmic membrane and outer membrane. In preliminary studies on oral inoculation of turkey poults with S. typhimurium chi 3987 expressing the gene encoding the B. avium 21-kDa protein, it was determined that a single dose of the recombinant Salmonella vaccine failed to elicit serum antibodies against the 21-kDa protein and challenge with wild-type B. avium 197 resulted in colonization of the trachea and thymus with B. avium 197.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefprozil granules in the pediatric field].
AB  - Cefprozil (CFPZ), a newly developed oral cephalosporin in a fine granular form for pediatric use, was administered to children with bacterial infections. MICs were determined for 6 drugs including CFPZ, cephalexin (CEX), cefaclor (CCL), ampicillin (ABPC), methicillin (DMPPC) and cloxacillin (MCIPC) against the following 84 strains isolated from cases to which CFPZ was administered; 55 strains of Gram-positive cocci (GPC) including 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 49 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 4 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 29 strains of Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) including 10 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 18 strains of Escherichia coli, and 1 strain of Proteus mirabilis. MIC determination of these strains was done with an inoculum size of 10(6) CFU/ml. In pharmacokinetic studies, serum concentrations, urinary concentrations and urinary recovery rates were investigated using bioassay and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). CFPZ was orally administered 30 minutes before meals to 9 children with ages ranging from 7 years and 1 month to 12 years and 3 months. Three groups of 3 children were tested with doses of 4.0, 7.5 and 15.0 mg/kg, respectively. In addition to the above, clinical and bacteriological studies were performed in a total of 160 cases consisting of children with ages ranging 5 months to 12 years and 5 months. A mean dose of 8.6 mg/kg in 3-4 divided doses (130 cases of t.i.d. and 30 cases of q.i.d.) was administered for an average of 7 days. The 160 cases included 34 cases of pharyngitis, 5 cases of tonsillitis, 8 cases of acute bronchitis, 8 cases of pneumonia, 52 cases of scarlet fever, 4 cases of acute purulent otitis media, 47 cases of urinary tract infection, 1 case of purulent lymphadenitis and 1 case of posthitis. Adverse reactions and abnormal clinical laboratory test results were also examined in 166 cases, including 6 cases excluded from the evaluation of clinical efficacy. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. With regard to GPC, MICs of CFPZ against 2 strains of S. aureus were 0.78 or 1.56 micrograms/ml and CFPZ showed the second highest activity to MCIPC. MICs of CFPZ against 49 strains of S. pyogenes were all less than 0.025 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - beta-Lactam resistance in gram-negative bacteria: global trends and clinical impact.
AB  - Microbial drug resistance is an inescapable consequence of the utilization of antimicrobial agents in a given environment. Nowhere is the importance of resistance more evident than among agents of the beta-lactam family. Trends toward increased resistance can be seen among fastidious gram-negative bacteria like Haemophilus influenzae, where ampicillin resistance varies from 1% to 64% globally. For Escherichia coli, ampicillin resistance has risen to > or = 50% in high-risk populations, and resistance to third-generation cephalosporins is now being seen in certain areas. Inducible beta-lactamases have been responsible for increasing multiple beta-lactam resistance among certain Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and this has been associated with increased use of newer cephalosporins. Xanthomonas maltophilia with its two inducible beta-lactamases is becoming an increasingly important nosocomial pathogen, especially in areas of heavy imipenem utilization. Only through the recognition of factors associated with increasing resistance and the mechanisms responsible can strategies be designed for minimizing beta-lactam resistance.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefprozil in pediatric  patients].
AB  - Cefprozil (CFPZ, BMY-28100), a new oral cephem antibiotic, was studied for its antibacterial activities, absorption and excretion upon administration. Its clinical efficacies were also studied in pediatric patients with infections. A study on antibacterial activities of CFPZ against 11 clinical isolates including 6 species found that its activities against Staphylococcus aureus, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus, Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae were equal or superior to those of CCL. When CFPZ was given to patients orally at 15 mg/kg, maximum serum concentration was obtained between 1 to 2 hours after administration and urinary excretion rate in the first 6 hours was 33.8 +/- 17.6%. Clinical evaluation was done in a total of 25 patients with various infections. Responses were excellent in 15 cases and good in 10 cases, hence the efficacy rate was 100%. As side effect, soft stool was found in 1 case, and eosinophilia in 2 cases and elevation of GOT and GPT in 1 case were found as abnormal laboratory test results, but none of them was serious. It appears that CFPZ is an effective and safe antibiotic in the field of pediatrics.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on cefprozil in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies on cefprozil (CFPZ, BMY-28100), a new cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. Serum concentrations, urinary concentrations and urinary recovery rates of CFPZ were determined upon oral administration of CFPZ after meal at doses of 4 mg/kg granules in a case, 7.5 mg/kg granules in 2 cases and 15 mg/kg granules in one. Peak serum levels of CFPZ were obtained at an hour in 3 cases and at 2 hours in 1 case after administration of the drug with a range of 2.7-8.6 micrograms/ml with half-lives of 0.69-0.95 hours. Urinary recovery rates in the first 6 hours after administration ranged from 59.4-71.3%. 2. MICs of CFPZ against 36 clinical isolates (Staphylococcus aureus 4 strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae 5, Streptococcus pyogenes 5, Escherichia coli 5, Haemophilus influenzae 12, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 4, and Branhamella catarrhalis 1) were compared with those of cefaclor (CCL) and ampicillin (ABPC). The antibacterial activity of CFPZ was superior to those of CCL against Gram-positive cocci, and to those of ABPC against E. coli, and was equal to those of CCL and inferior to those of ABPC against H. influenzae. 3. Thirty-seven pediatric patients with acute infectious diseases (pharyngitis/tonsillitis 17, bronchitis 7, pneumonia 3, skin and soft tissue infection 2, and urinary tract infection 8) were treated with CFPZ at daily doses of 10-47 mg/kg t.i.d. as a rule. The efficacy rates were 100% clinically and 56% bacteriologically. 4. Side effects or abnormal laboratory test values were not observed except for an increased platelet count in 1 case and elevated GOT, GPT values in 2 cases.
TI  - [Clinical study on cefprozil in pediatrics].
AB  - Clinical efficacy and safety of cefprozil (CFPZ, BMY-28100), a newly developed oral cephalosporin, were studied in our pediatric department. Clinical effectiveness, bacteriological effectiveness and side effects were studied in 116 pediatric patients with ages ranging 4 months to 11 years. CFPZ was given 4.6-14.1 mg/kg daily in 3 times for 3-10 days. Clinical efficacies were evaluated in 112 patients, and the therapeutic effectiveness were excellent in 1 and good in 6 for 7 patients with acute pharyngitis, excellent in 24 and good in 26 for acute purulent tonsillitis, excellent in 3, good in 8 and fair in 1 for acute bronchitis, excellent in 21, good in 7, fair in 1 and poor in 1 for acute pneumonia, excellent in 1 acute purulent parotitis, excellent in 2 and good in 7 for acute UTI, good in 1 impetigo, fair in 1 periproctal abscess and good in 1 acute enteritis. The effectiveness rate was 96.4%. Bacteriologically, 4 strains of Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase producing strains), 1 strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis (beta-lactamase producing strain), 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, 4 strains of beta-Streptococcus, 1 strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae (beta-lactamase producing strain) and 1 strain of Salmonella C2 were all disappeared, and of 22 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 20 strains were disappeared, 1 was decreased and 1 was unknown, of 5 strains of Escherichia coli (3 beta-lactamase producing strains), 4 were disappeared and 1 was decreased, of 29 strains of Haemophilus influenzae (14 beta-lactamase producing strains), 14 were disappeared, 11 were decreased, 3 persisted and 1 was unknown and of 2 strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae (1 beta-lactamase producing strain), 1 was disappeared and 1 persisted. The bacteriological eradication rates for Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria were 97.1% and 56.8%, respectively, and the drug was especially effective against Gram-positive bacteria. No side effects nor refusal of ingestion were observed. As abnormalities in laboratory test results, 3 cases of elevation of eosinophil counts and 1 of elevation of platelet counts were observed. In conclusion, CFPZ was considered to be a safe and highly effective antibiotic in pediatric infections.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of a new oral cephem, cefprozil in children].
AB  - Cefprozil (CFPZ, BMY-28100) was evaluated for its efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics in children. CFPZ was effective against streptococcal pharyngitis, pneumococcal lower respiratory tract infections, staphylococcal skin infections and Escherichia coli urinary tract infections, but was less effective against lower respiratory tract infections and otitis media due to Haemophilus influenzae. No adverse reactions were encountered in 46 cases treated with CFPZ. With a premeal administration of 7.5 mg/kg, the Cmax was approximately 3.2 micrograms/ml and the T 1/2 beta was 1.4 hours. From the present study, CFPZ appears to be safe and effective against community-acquired childhood infections.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of ceftazidime on fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (CAZ) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout Japan in 1989 and 1991. Those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. The results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, MIC90 of CAZ in 1991 were markedly higher against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Also, among other bacteria such as Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Xanthomonas maltophilia, and Bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to CAZ were observed in high proportions. However, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of CAZ on Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella spp, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Haemophilus influenzae and Anaerobic GPC (Gram-positive cocci). 2. Among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli of Enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. It appears therefore, that CAZ failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. Antimicrobial activities of CAZ on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. However, it was also demonstrated that CAZ maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. When it is additionally taken into account that CAZ is one of those limited drugs with activity against P. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that CAZ still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.
TI  - A periplasmic protein disulfide oxidoreductase is required for transformation of  Haemophilus influenzae Rd.
AB  - The mutated gene in JG16, a Haemophilus influenzae strain deficient in competence-induced DNA binding and uptake, was cloned and the wild-type allele was sequenced. The gene was shown by Northern analysis to be constitutively expressed on a 1.7-kilobase transcript. The gene product was identified as a 20.6-kDa protein targeted to the periplasm. The protein contains the sequence Cys-Pro-His-Cys (CPHC) and is highly similar to two other periplasmic CPHC motif-containing proteins: DsbA, an Escherichia coli protein (45% identity, 87% homology) and TcpG, a Vibrio cholerae protein (32% identity, 74% homology). Both DsbA and TcpG promote disulfide bond formation in periplasmic proteins, are required for pilus biogenesis, and, like thioredoxin, are capable of reducing insulin in vitro. The Haemophilus protein was shown to complement an E. coli mutation in DsbA and was named Por (periplasmic oxidoreductase). In JG16 the competence-dependent redistribution of inner membrane proteins did not occur. These findings suggest that Por is required for the correct assembly and/or folding of one or more disulfide-containing cell envelope protein involved either in competence development or in the DNA-binding and -uptake machinery.
TI  - Use of chromosomal gene fusions to investigate the role of repetitive DNA in regulation of genes involved in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis in Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The lic3 locus of Haemophilus influenzae consists of four open reading frames. The derived amino acid sequences of orf2 and orf4 exhibit homology to Escherichia coli GalE and AdK, respectively. The functions of orf1 and orf3 remain unknown. orf1 contains multiple tandem repeats of the tetrameric DNA sequence CAAT near the 5' end. Two possible translational starts (ATG1 and ATG2) lie upstream. We have used lacZ fusions to investigate whether changes in the number of CAAT repeats in conjunction with differential usage of the upstream frames control the expression of lic3-orf1. Phase-variable expression of lacZ was observed for individual colonies and could be related to variable numbers of CAAT repeats. Of the three possible upstream frames, only one, containing the more downstream of the two possible ATG start codons (ATG2), is used for strong expression of lacZ. Utilization of the more upstream ATG (ATG1) or ATG2 was observed with medium-level expression, while utilization of any of the three possible frames was observed when lacZ was expressed at low to undetectable levels, indicating that other mechanisms may affect expression. To investigate this, lacZ was fused in frame with ATG2 of lic3-orf1, with concomitant deletion of the repeats. Phase-variable expression was still observed, supporting the view that an alternative level of control operates in conjunction with the repeat mechanism.
TI  - A new subfamily of bacterial ABC-type transport systems catalyzing export of drugs and carbohydrates.
AB  - Sequence comparison studies revealed that the drug resistance transporter of Streptomyces peucetius (DrrAB) and two nodulation gene products (NodIJ) of Rhizobium leguminosarum are homologous to proteins encoded by three sets of genes that comprise capsular polysaccharide export systems in gram-negative bacteria: KpsTM of Escherichia coli, BexABC of Haemophilus influenzae, and CtrDCB of Neisseria meningitidis. These five systems comprise a new subfamily within the family of ATP binding cassette (ABC)-type transporters. We have termed this subfamily the ABC-2 subfamily. For three of the systems comprising this subfamily (Drr, Nod, and Kps) only one integral membrane constituent has been identified, whereas for the other two systems (Bex and Ctr) two dis-similar integral membrane constituents have been found. This observation suggests that the transmembrane channels of ABC-2-type transporters can be formed of homo- or heterooligomers as is true of several other classes of transport systems.
TI  - Generation of lipooligosaccharide mutants of Haemophilus influenzae type b.
AB  - We previously reported the analysis of recombinant plasmids from Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) that lead to modifications of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Y. Abu Kwaik, R. E. McLaughlin, M. A. Apicella, and S. M. Spinola, Mol. Microbiol. 5:2475-2480, 1991). The modified LPS species are recognized by monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) 6E4 and 3F11. MAb 6E4 binds to a stable 2-keto-3-deoxyoctulosonic acid epitope, while MAb 3F11 binds to a Gal beta 1-4GlcNac epitope that phase varies in Hib at a frequency of 2 to 5%. The internal EcoRI fragment containing most of the DNA required for LPS modification in E. coli was used as the target for transposon mutagenesis. Plasmids containing minitransposon m-Tn3(Cm) randomly inserted into the target fragment were transformed into the isogenic Hib strain, and transposon integration into the Hib chromosome was verified by colony hybridization. The lipooligosaccharides of 36 transformants were phenotypically and antigenically characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and reactivity with a variety of MAbs that recognize both stable and phase-varying lipooligosaccharide epitopes. The majority of the mutants had altered reactivity with MAb 6E4. With one exception, these mutants retained the ability to express phase-varying epitopes. Analysis of the transformants suggested that the 6E4 epitope was contained on an oligosaccharide chain separate from that of phase-varying epitopes and appeared to be assembled in at least three separate steps.
TI  - In vitro activity of T-3761, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of T-3761, a new fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agent which  has an oxazine ring structure with a cyclopropyl moiety at C-10, was compared with those of other agents against 2,854 clinical isolates. T-3761 had a broad spectrum of activity and had potent activity against gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The MICs of T-3761 against 90% of the methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Clostridium spp. tested were 0.39 to 6.25 micrograms/ml. Its activity was comparable to those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin and four- to eightfold greater than those of norfloxacin and fleroxacin, but its activity was two- to eightfold less than that of tosufloxacin. Some isolates of ciprofloxacin-resistant S. aureus (MIC of ciprofloxacin, greater than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml) were still susceptible to T-3761 (MIC of T-3761, less than or equal to 0.78 micrograms/ml). The MICs of T-3761 against 90% of the streptococci and enterococci tested were 3.13 to 100 micrograms/ml. Its activity was equal to or 2- or 4-fold greater than those of norfloxacin and fleroxacin, equal to or 2- or 4-fold less than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and 4- to 16-fold less than that of tosufloxacin. The activity of T-3761 against gram-negative bacteria was usually fourfold greater than those of norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and fleroxacin. Many isolates which were resistant to nonfluoroquinolone agents, such as minocycline- or imipenem-resistant S. aureus, ceftazidime-resistant members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, gentamicin- or imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, were susceptible to T-3761. The MBCs of T-3761 were either equal to or twofold greater than the MICs. The number of viable cells decreased rapidly during incubation with T-3761 at one to four times the MIC. At a concentration of four times the MIC, the frequencies of appearance of spontaneous mutants resistant to T-3761 against S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, and P. aeruginosa were 2.2 x 10(-8) to less than or equal to 1.2 x 10(-9). The 50% inhibitory concentrations of T-3761 for DNA gyrases isolated from E. coli and P. aeruginosa were 0.88 and 1.9 micrograms/ml, respectively.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of a new quinolone, OPC-17116, possessing potent  activity against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of OPC-17116, a new fluoroquinolone, against  a wide variety of clinical isolates was evaluated and compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin. OPC-17116 showed potent broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The activity of this compound against gram-positive bacteria was higher than those of other quinolones, and its activity against gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria was roughly comparable to those of other quinolones. OPC-17116 had potent activity against important pathogens of respiratory tract infections such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis. The MICs of this compound against 90% of these organisms, except for methicillin-resistant S. aureus, ranged from less than or equal to 0.006 to 3.13 micrograms/ml. OPC-17116 at more than one-half the MICs was bactericidal against clinical isolates of S. aureus, Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa. The activity of OPC-17116 was decreased by several culture conditions such as acidic pH, high concentration of Mg2+ ions, and inoculum size of 10(7) CFU/ml. OPC-17116 inhibited the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrases from E. coli KL-16 and S. aureus SA113 (50% inhibitory concentrations, 0.19 and 23.0 micrograms/ml, respectively). The amount of OPC-17116 accumulation was higher than that of other quinolones in S. aureus.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of AM-1155, a new 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
AB  - AM-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. AM-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis; its MICs for 90% of strains tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. The activity of AM-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against Xanthomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Campylobacter jejuni, AM-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. At a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, AM-1155 inhibited 90% of Bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Development of resistance to AM-1155 in S. aureus and S. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. In the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, AM-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. The efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of AM-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. Against experimental pneumonia with Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, AM-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. AM-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa. These results suggest that AM-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.
TI  - Construction of chimaeric genes for mapping a surface-exposed epitope on the pilus of non-typable Haemophilus influenzae strain M37.
AB  - A murine monoclonal antibody (mAb), designated 3H12, reacts with a surface-exposed conformational epitope on the pilus of non-typable Haemophilus influenzae strain M37. This antibody does not recognize the related pilus from H. influenzae type b, strain MinnA. Although mAb 3H12 does not recognize strain M37 pilin on Western blots, mAb 3H12 recognizes the recombinant M37 pilin protein expressed by Escherichia coli. In order to map the epitope recognized by mAb 3H12, we constructed a series of chimaeric genes. The chimaeric genes were expressed in E. coli and the chimaeric proteins characterized with respect to their reactivity with mAb 3H12. Residues between 37 and 100 of the M37 pilin protein are essential for the expression of the mAb 3H12 epitope. Residues in the carboxyl half of the M37 protein enhance the reactivity of mAb 3H12 when expressed in the presence of residues 37-100. Construction of chimaeric genes may provide a general methodology for mapping of conformational epitopes expressed by one of a related pair of proteins.
TI  - [Bacteriological examination of bronchial aspirates obtained via fiberoptic bronchoscopy].
AB  - We present the bacteriological findings in 329 aspirates from fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Quantitative cultures were not performed. 92 of the patients had radiologically confirmed pneumonia, 58 possibly had infectious bronchitis or pneumonia which was not verified radiologically, 154 had other pulmonary diseases and 25 had no verified pulmonary disease. 13% of aspirates contained no bacterial isolates and 33% revealed growth of multiple bacteria, classified as "normal pharyngeal flora". Among the 54% with specified bacterial findings the most frequent bacteria were viridans streptococci, staphylococci, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The differences in bacterial flora between the patient groups were only minimal. Klebsiella and Escherichia coli were the only bacteria indicating presence of pneumonia. S pneumoniae were found more frequently among patients with no signs of infection. Bronchial aspirates obtained with a fiberbronchoscope may give false positive results and are of limited value in diagnosing pneumonia. However, the presence of gram negative intestinal rods may indicate bacterial respiratory infection in hospitalized patients. Improving sampling and culture techniques can possibly improve the value of bacteriological findings.
TI  - Effect of administration of diethylcarbamazine on experimental bacterial and fungal infections in mice.
AB  - Other researchers have found that diethylcarbamazine (DEC) is effective treatment for filariasis despite a lack of demonstrated in vitro antifilarial activity. The results of our previous investigations using feline and murine leukemia virus models encouraged us to investigate the use of DEC with other infections. In the current experiments, DEC treatmentS was associated with (a) increased survival and decreased brain Streptococcus pneumoniae levels following S. pneumoniae challenge in previously immunized mice; (b) increased serum antibody levels to S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Haemophilus influenzae following inoculation of live bacteria; and (c) lower brain fungal levels following intravenous injection of Aspergillus fumigatus or increasing numbers of Cryptococcus neoformans organisms, and lower brain and kidney levels of Candida albicans following intravenous injection of increasing numbers of C. albicans.
TI  - Cloning, characterization, and DNA base sequence of the high-level streptomycin resistance gene strA1 of Haemophilus influenzae Rd.
AB  - The high-level streptomycin resistance strA1 gene of Haemophilus influenzae Rd was cloned in plasmid pAT4 as a 2.1-kbp EcoRI insert. It was later replaced in pAT4 by the wild-type strA+ gene. Plasmid pAT4 carrying the strA+ gene is highly unstable and renders chromosomally resistant recipients sensitive to streptomycin. The strA+ gene and the instability factor both reside on a 500-base HindIII-EcoRI subfragment. The two biological activities are also expressed in Escherichia coli. Both wild-type (strA+) and mutant (strA1) genes were sequenced. They show considerable nucleotide homology with the E. coli strA+ gene and its product.
TI  - The phototoxicity of 8-methoxythionepsoralen and 6-methylthionecoumarin.
AB  - The phototoxicity of 8-methoxythionepsoralen (8-MOTP) and 6-methylthione coumarin (6-MTC) when activated by UV-A has been investigated using a variety of Escherichia coli strains, Haemophilus influenzae transforming DNA and Escherichia coli pBR322 plasmid DNA. The results demonstrate that 8-MOTP is a strictly oxygen independent photosensitizer that is about 500-fold less efficient in forming lesions leading to equivalent lethality than is the parent compound from which it is derived (8-MOP). As is true for 8-MOP, 8-MOTP is capable of inducing histidine independent mutations in E. coli and inactivating transforming DNA consistent with DNA being a target for lesions induced by this molecule in the presence of UV-A. 6-MTC is a strongly oxygen dependent photosensitizer activated by UV-A when tested with either E. coli cells or transforming DNA in contrast to the parent compound (6-methylcoumarin; 6-MC) which is not phototoxic when treated with UV-A. These results imply that the membrane may be an important target leading to lethality. 6-MTC in the presence of UV-A can inactivate pBR322 plasmid and Haemophilus influenzae transforming DNA activity in vitro suggesting that DNA is a potential target for this molecule when activated by UV-A.
TI  - Plasma bactericidal activity of a new C-5 methyl fluoroquinolone after oral doses of 400 and 800 mg.
AB  - The plasma bactericidal activity of a new C-5 methyl fluoroquinolone, OPC-17116,  was determined after once-daily oral ingestion of 400 mg and 800 mg in normal, healthy volunteers. OPC-17116 at a 400-mg dose produced plasma bactericidal titers greater than or equal to 1:16 at 12 hours against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. OPC-17116 bactericidal titers against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 1:2 or 1:4 at 6 and 12 hours. The plasma bactericidal titers against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 1:4 or greater, but bactericidal titers against Staphylococcus aureus were 1:2 at 12 hours and less than 1:2 at 24 hours. The 800-mg dose of OPC-17116 produced bactericidal titers of at least 1:32 at 12 hours for the Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus, and Moraxella, and 1:4 for S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae, but bactericidal titers against S. aureus were 1:2. These data would suggest that an 800-mg dose of OPC-17116 taken orally once daily would provide adequate concentrations to treat infections due to the pathogens examined in this study.
TI  - Blood-brain barrier damage in patients with bacterial meningitis: association with tumor necrosis factor-alpha but not interleukin-1 beta.
AB  - Brain damage after meningeal infection could result from impairment of cerebral endothelial cell functions and disruption of blood-brain barriers. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) produce many of their effects by acting on endothelial cells. This study correlates levels of TNF alpha and IL-1 beta in paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples with the degree of blood-brain barrier damage, as manifested by CSF to serum albumin quotient, in 48 patients with bacterial meningitis and 66 controls. CSF levels of TNF alpha and IL-1 beta in bacterial meningitis were significantly higher than in controls. Intrathecal levels of TNF alpha, but not IL-1 beta, correlated with albumin quotient (P less than .001), with degree of blood-brain barrier disruption (P less than .001), and with disease severity and indices of meningeal inflammation. Sequential CSF samples demonstrated that IL-1 beta and TNF alpha disappear from the CSF within 24 h of antibiotic treatment. Data presented here suggest that TNF alpha is related to blood-brain barrier damage in bacterial meningitis and that its effect could be dissociated from that of IL-1 beta.
TI  - Presence of RNA from yeast inhibits the photoreactivation of UV-irradiated DNA by Phr A photolyase from Escherichia coli.
AB  - Photoreactivation of UV-irradiated DSNA with phr A photolyase from Escherichia coli was studied in the presence of yeast RNA. Mixing of RNA with UV-irradiated DNA before its treatment with photolyase inhibited the photoreactivation of DNA. Denatured (by sonication) RNA was found to be more effective in blocking photolyase action. Agarose gel electrophoresis experiments suggest that this inhibition of photoreactivation is due to interference in the binding of photolyase with UV-irradiated DNA by yeast RNA.
TI  - In vitro activity of MC-352, a new 16-membered macrolide.
AB  - The in vitro activity of MC-352, 3,4'-dideoxy-5-O-mycaminosyltylonolide, was compared with those of erythromycin, clarithromycin, and rokitamycin. The MC-352 MIC90 (MIC for 90% of isolates) for erythromycin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, similar to those of the other agents. The MC-352 MIC50 for erythromycin-resistant S. aureus was 2 micrograms/ml, similar to that of rokitamycin. The MC-352 MIC90 (0.12 micrograms/ml) for Streptococcus pyogenes was similar to those of erythromycin and clarithromycin and superior to that of rokitamycin, and the MC-352 MIC90 for group B, C, and G streptococci was 0.25 microgram/ml. MC-352 and clarithromycin had an MIC90 of 0.12 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae. Erythromycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis was inhibited by MC-352 at 1 microgram/ml, but the MIC for constitutively erythromycin-resistant isolates was greater than 16 micrograms/ml. Legionella pneumophila was inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. MC-352 was the most active agent against Bacteroides fragilis, with an MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml, and was more active than the other agents against Haemophilus influenzae, with an MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. Moraxella spp. were inhibited by MC-352 at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. The MIC90 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia spp. was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. MC-352 was bactericidal for S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae, and its activity was not altered by human serum.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of ticarcillin alone and ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid against beta-lactamase producing and non-producing microorganisms.
AB  - A total of 818 clinical bacterial isolates were tested for the production of beta-lactamase by rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method and for the susceptibility to ticarcillin alone and in combination with clavulanic acid (2 micrograms/mL) by agar dilution method. These included 83 strains of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), 31 of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 49 of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 58 of Haemophilus influenzae, 112 of Escherichia coli, 118 of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 58 of Proteus mirabilis, 30 of Proteus vulgaris, 60 of Serratia marcescens, 113 of Enterobacter cloacae, 60 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 46 of Bacteroides fragilis. The results revealed that 46.6% of P. mirabilis, 53.4% of H. influenzae, 57.1% of N. gonorrhoeae, 80% of P. vulgaris, 83.9% of MRSA, 85.6% of MSSA, 87.5% of E. coli, 91.7% of S. marcescens, 95.7% of B. fragilis, 98.2% of E. cloacae, and 100% of K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa strains produced beta-lactamase. In general, beta-lactamase nonproducers were more susceptible to ticarcillin than beta-lactamase producers. The ranges of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ticarcillin for beta-lactamase nonproducers of MSSA, MRSA, H. influenzae, E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. marcescens, E. cloacae, B. fragilis and beta-lactamase producers of MSSA, H. influenzae strains were all within the in vitro susceptible range. The presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the antibacterial activity of ticarcillin against beta-lactamase producers of MRSA, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris and B. fragilis strains. Clavulanic acid had no synergistic activity for ticarcillin against S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa and E. cloacae.
TI  - Ferric-ion-photosensitized damage to DNA by hydroxyl and non-hydroxyl radical mechanisms.
AB  - Iron(III) and UVA (320-400 nm) light strongly diminished the transforming activity of Haemophilus influenzae DNA in the presence of oxygen. Iron(III) alone in the absence of light had no measurable effect on the transforming activity. The chelating agent ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) conferred virtually complete protection, but hydroxyl radical scavengers (mannitol, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and dimethyl sulfoxide) inhibited only a small fraction of the inactivation. Treatment of plasmid DNA (pBR322) with iron(III) results in the conversion of the covalently closed circular form of the plasmid to open circles and ultimately to the linear form. Concomitant with the alteration in the conformation of the plasmid, the ability to transform Escherichia coli was reduced. In model systems, iron(III) photoreacted with the DNA backbone causing nicking and double-strand breakage. The results are consistent with a mechanism involving a preliminary complexation of iron(III) by DNA followed by the generation of reactive free radicals other than .OH. We suggest that bound iron, or other UV-absorbing transition metal complexes, may be chromophores capable of causing DNA damage in the long-wave near-UV region.
TI  - Inhibition of lymphoproliferation by middle ear effusion in experimental otitis media.
AB  - In this study, experimental otitis media was created in the chinchilla by direct  middle ear challenge with Escherichia coli endotoxin, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The effusions recovered from the chinchillas in all four challenge groups were shown to inhibit the lymphoproliferative response of chinchilla peripheral blood lymphocytes to stimulation with phytohemagglutinin. The effect was dose dependent, and for effusions of infectious origin, the degree of inhibition was directly related to the duration of infection. Presence of the inhibitor in plasma was undocumented, suggesting a local production within the middle ear. Lymphocytes from middle ears infected with bacteria but not middle ears challenged with endotoxin were hyporesponsive or nonresponsive to stimulation with phytohemagglutinin. These results confirm the presence of an inhibitor of the lymphoproliferative response in experimental otitis media of different etiologies.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of ceftriaxone against clinically isolated strains].
AB  - Antibiotic activities (MICs) of ceftriaxone (CTRX) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of other cephems. 1. When compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated MIC90s of CTRX: Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Providencia spp. No changes were observed in MIC90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Peptostreptococcus spp. 2. The MIC90 of CTRX to S. pneumoniae was high because a large number of benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP) was present among this species. The MIC80 to Bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant B. fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. Other oxime-type cephems also had high MICs against the above mentioned bacteria. Therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as CTRX against PISP and B. fragilis group. 3. Sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), cephamycin-resistant as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. Some of there resistant bacteria are also CTRX-resistant, and CTRX had insufficient activities against them. 4. With regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with CTRX-resistance from year to year, the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989 and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "Subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. It appears that those strains resistant to cephems including CTRX are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. CTRX, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. Furthermore, considering that CTRX is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that CTRX is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of LJC 10,627.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LJC 10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and gentamicin. LJC 10,627 inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Hafnia alvei, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas cepacia, salmonellae, shigellae, aeromonas, and yersiniae at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Haemophilus influenzae was inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml, and moraxellae were inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml. LJC 10,627 was twofold more active than imipenem against aerobic gram-negative organisms and inhibited ceftazidime-, cefotaxime-, and gentamicin-resistant members of the genera Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Xanthomonas maltophilia strains were resistant to the drug. Imipenem was two- to fourfold more active than LJC 10,627 against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. LJC 10,627 did not inhibit most methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. LJC 10,627 inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 and 0.12 microgram/ml, respectively. Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides spp. were inhibited by 0.5 microgram of LJC 10,627 per ml. Serum (50%) did not affect the MICs. LJC 10,627 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of Bush types 2b, 2b', TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, TEM-7, TEM-9, and SHV-1; the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Bush type 1; P-99; a Morganella enzyme; or a Citrobacter freundii enzyme. The Bush type 2c and 2d enzymes OXA-1, OXA-2, PSE-1, PSE-2, and PSE-4 did not hydrolyze LJC 10,627, nor did the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella spp., Bacteroides fragilis, and Proteus vulgaris. The beta-lactamase of Xanthomonas hydrolyzed LJC 10,627, albeit at approximately one-third the rate that imipenem was hydrolyzed.
TI  - The bactericidal activity and postantibiotic effect of trospectomycin.
AB  - Trospectomycin sulfate (trospectomycin, TRS) is a novel, broad-spectrum, aminocyclitol antibiotic that is being developed clinically for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections, bacterial vaginosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and gonorrhea. This study investigated the bactericidal activity (by time-kill kinetics) and the postantibiotic effect (PAE) of TRS. Species-dependent bacteriostatic/bactericidal activity was observed for TRS; the antibiotic was bacteriostatic for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Escherichia coli, and bactericidal for Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Bacteroides fragilis (one of two test strains). When TRS was tested at four times its minimum inhibitory concentration or at a maximum test concentration of 32 micrograms/ml, with a 1-hr exposure period, the following PAE values were recorded: S. epidermidis 30032, 1.8 hr, En. faecalis ATCC 29212, 1.6 hr, E. coli UC 311, 1.5 hr, E. coli UC 9451, 1.5 hr, H. influenzae 30063, greater than 4.0 hr, B. fragilis ATCC 25285, 5.2 hr, and B. fragilis UC 12199, 6.7 hr. The broad-spectrum PAE that was observed for TRS is somewhat unique compared with other antibiotics.
TI  - In vitro activity of loracarbef and effects of susceptibility test methods.
AB  - Loracarbef is a new oral antimicrobial of the carbacephem class with in vitro activity against the common pathogens associated with skin infections, otitis media, sinusitis, bronchopulmonary infections, and urinary tract infections. A review of the literature shows the following ranges for 90% minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) values (microgram/mL) against the organisms that commonly cause these illnesses: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.25-2.0; Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive), 0.5-8.0; M. catarrhalis (beta-lactamase negative), 0.12-0.25; Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive), 0.5-16.0; H. influenzae (beta-lactamase negative), 0.25-8.0; Escherichia coli, 2.0-25; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.25-8.0; Proteus mirabilis, 1.0-8.0; Streptococcus pyogenes, less than or equal to 0.06-1.0; Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase positive), 8.0; S. aureus (beta-lactamase negative), 1.0-2.0. The in vitro activity of loracarbef against these common outpatient pathogens is similar to that of other oral antimicrobials such as cefaclor, cefuroxime axetil, cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The results of in vitro susceptibility tests with any antimicrobial, including loracarbef, are somewhat dependent on the specific test method that is employed in the laboratory. This is particularly true with H. influenzae. Furthermore, the results of loracarbef susceptibility tests are of uncertain value in predicting therapeutic outcome.
TI  - Review of the in vitro antibacterial activity of cefprozil, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - Cefprozil is a newer oral cephalosporin with a spectrum of activity against organisms that include gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. A review of published data shows that cefprozil is active (susceptibility, less than or equal to 8 micrograms/mL; moderate susceptibility, 16 micrograms/mL; resistance, greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/mL) against gram-positive species such as streptococci, methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, and Listeria monocytogenes; it may have marginal activity against some enterococci. Among the gram-negative species, cefprozil has activity against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. For anaerobic species, cefprozil has activity against clostridial species, including Clostridium difficile, peptostreptococci, and possibly Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Eubacterium. The activity of cefprozil is generally greater than that of cephalexin and generally similar to that of cefaclor. In these reports, cefprozil showed more in vitro activity than cephalexin and cefaclor against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, penicillin-resistant viridans streptococci, beta-lactamase-positive methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and C. difficile, although the clinical significance of some of these differences has yet to be studied.
TI  - Distinct plasmid profiles of Pasteurella haemolytica serotypes and the characterization and amplification in Escherichia coli of ampicillin-resistance plasmids encoding ROB-1 beta-lactamase.
AB  - Thirty-five isolates of Pasteurella haemolytica from cattle or sheep were screened for the presence of plasmids and for resistance to a range of antibiotics. Eight strains (four of serotype A1, three of serotype A2 and one untypable) contained plasmid DNA and isolates of the same serotype had similar plasmid profiles, which were different from those of the other serotypes. All but one of the plasmid-bearing strains were isolated from pneumonic animals or from animals in contact with pneumonic cattle or sheep. In A2 and untypable strains, there was no obvious correlation between antibiotic resistance and the presence of a specific plasmid. In contrast, all plasmid-bearing A1 strains exhibited ampicillin resistance (ApR), which was shown by transfer studies to be plasmid-mediated. Plasmid DNA prepared from E. coli transformants was not routinely detected on ethidium-bromide-stained agarose gels, but could be amplified to detectable levels by treatment of cultures with chloramphenicol (Cm) or by modifying the growth conditions. The ApR plasmids from P. haemolytica were identical by restriction enzyme analysis. Restriction analysis and hybridization data indicated that these plasmids were closely related to the prototype ROB-1 beta-lactamase-encoding plasmid, originally isolated from Haemophilus influenzae. From substrate profiles and isoelectric focusing data, the beta-lactamases encoded by the P. haemolytica plasmids were indistinguishable from the ROB-1 beta-lactamase.
TI  - [Bacteriological and clinical studies on meropenem in the pediatric field].
AB  - Bacteriological and clinical studies have been performed on meropenem (MEPM, SM-7338), a newly developed carbapenem antibiotic, in the pediatric field. 1. Antibacterial activities of MEPM against 24 clinical isolates were determined. MEPM showed excellent activity against Gram-positive bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacteria, especially Escherichia coli and Branhamella catarrhalis. Against Haemophilus influenzae, MEPM had a higher activity than imipenem and flomoxef, but had a lower activity than piperacillin and cefoperazone. 2. Clinical efficacies of MEPM were evaluated in 32 cases with bacterial infections. A poor efficacy was observed in 1 patient with phlegmon but excellent or good efficacies were obtained in other 31 patients with tonsillitis (1), pneumonia (17), UTI (12), or SSSS (1). The overall efficacy rate was 96.9%. All strains except 1 of S. aureus were eradicated by the administration of MEPM, and a high eradication rate of 95.8% (23 out of 24 strains) was obtained. 3. No side effects were observed in 35 evaluated cases. As abnormal laboratory test results, elevated GOT, elevated GPT, eosinophilia and neutropenia were noted in 4, 4, 4 and 2 patients, respectively. 4. Influences on blood coagulation parameters were studied. PIVKA II was elevated upon administration of MEPM in some cases, but no changes in ATT, TT, HPT or Fbg were observed during the treatment. Based on the above results, it has been concluded that MEPM is a safe and effective drug to use in the treatment of pediatric infections. The usual recommended dosage and administration should be 10 to 20 mg/kg of MEPM at a time, using intravenous drip infusion, 3 times a day.
TI  - [Clinical and pharmacokinetic evaluation of meropenem and its effect on fecal flora in children].
AB  - Forty-five children were treated with meropenem (MEPM) and the clinical efficacy  and side effects were evaluated. The ages of the patients ranged from 1 month to 9 years and their body weights from 5.2 to 25 kg. Doses given were 17.2-45.5 mg/kg every 6 to 8 hours for 2 to 24.5 days. Those patients who responded to the MEPM treatment included 15 children with pneumonia, 7 with pharyngitis, 3 with cervical lymphadenitis, 3 with cellulitis, 10 with urinary tract infections and 4 with other infections. Among 42 children, the results were excellent in 29, good in 12 and fair in 1. The drug was well tolerated, although slightly elevated serum concentrations of transaminases occurred in 5 patients, eosinophilia in 2 patients, and neutropenia in 1 patient among 45 patients examined. The pharmacokinetic studies on MEPM were done in 6 patients. Their ages ranged from 2 to 9 years and body weights from 14.5 to 23.2 kg. In 4 patients, plasma concentrations at the end of 30 minutes drip infusion of 20 mg/kg were 29.28 +/- 10.29 micrograms/ml and those 3 hours later were 0.49 +/- 0.26 micrograms/ml. Serum elimination half-lives of the drug were 0.66 +/- 0.12 hours in these patients. Excretion rates of this drug into urine in the first 6 hours after initiation of drug administration were 53 and 40% in 2 of these patients. In 2 patients with 35 and 44 mg/kg of drug administration, plasma concentrations were higher than those given 20 mg/kg of the drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies with meropenem in the pediatric field. Pediatric Study Group of Meropenem].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluations in pediatrics were made on meropenem (SM-7338, MEPM), a new parenteral dehydropeptidase-1 stable carbapenem used without any inhibitors, at 33 medical institutions. The results are summarized as follows. 1. Pharmacokinetic studies. MEPM at a dose of 10, 20, or 40 mg/kg was administered to 53 children by 30-minute drip infusion. Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax's) and plasma half-lives (T1/2's) of these doses were 28.5, 47.2 and 130.0 micrograms/ml, and 0.80, 0.93 and 0.94 hours, respectively. A clear dose response was observed in Cmax's and T1/2 values were quite similar to those observed in adults. In the first 6 hours after administration, 54.4 to 68.1% of the administered drug was recovered in urine. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of MEPM in patients with purulent meningitis were 0.13 microgram/ml at a dose of 6 mg/kg, and 0.64 to 4.22 micrograms/ml at a dose of 29 to 44 mg/kg within day 4 of onset. The penetration rate of MEPM showed an intermediate value among those for other cephalosporin antibiotics. 2. Clinical study. Clinical efficacies of MEPM were evaluated in 389 cases. The most common doses used were 10 to 20 mg/kg/once, 2 to 3 times a day. The maximum dose was 173 mg/kg/day q.i.d. MEPM gave "excellent" or "good" responses in 242 (97.6%) out of 248 cases in which causative organisms were documented and in 134 (95.0%) out of 141 cases in which causative organisms were not identified. Clinical efficacy rates were 100% in 11 patients with purulent meningitis, 85.7% in 7 with septicemia, 98.8% in 173 with pneumonia, and 100% in 65 with UTI. Bacteriologically, 260 strains (96.7%) out of 269 strains were eradicated by MEPM treatment. Eradication rates were 89.2% for Staphylococcus aureus (37 strains) and 100% for Streptococcus pneumoniae (35 strains). The overall eradication rate for Gram-positive bacteria was 94.6%. Among Gram-negative bacteria, 98.3% out of 172 strains were eradicated. The eradication rate of Haemophilus influenzae (73 strains) was 98.6% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11 strains) was 90.9%, and all of Branhamella catarrhalis (15 strains), Escherichia coli (42 strains), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6 strains) were eradicated. Out of 84 cases for which previous antibiotic therapies of 3 days or longer were not successful, MEPM gave "excellent" or "good" responses in 77 cases (91.7%) and excellent bacteriological responses (95.7%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Cloning and analysis of lipooligosaccharide synthesis genes of Haemophilus influenzae type b that assemble or expose a 2-keto-3-deoxyoctulosonic acid epitope in Escherichia coli.
AB  
TI  - Fimbria-mediated adherence and hemagglutination of Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The gram-negative bacterium Haemophilus influenzae expresses morphologically and  functionally distinct types of fimbriae, of which the LKP fimbriae mediate hemagglutination and adherence to human epithelial cells but hamper mucosal invasion. Therefore, the both in vivo and in vitro observed fimbrial phase variation may contribute to the pathogenesis of the infection. The existence of greater than 14 LKP serotypes hampers vaccine development based on fimbriae, since a monovalent fimbria vaccine confers protection against only the homologous strain. Cloning of the fimbrial genes in Escherichia coli results in the expression of morphologically intact fimbriae. Analysis of the cloned DNA indicates that a fimbrial gene cluster is necessary for formation of complete fimbriae and for fimbria-mediated adherence. The gene encoding the subunit is highly conserved among H. influenzae and belongs to the family of E. coli fimbriae. The phase variation is transcriptionally regulated by variation of the length of the reiterated sequence that forms the promoter region of the subunit gene.
TI  - The hbpA gene of Haemophilus influenzae type b encodes a heme-binding lipoprotein conserved among heme-dependent Haemophilus species.
AB  - A membrane-associated lipoprotein of Haemophilus influenzae type b has previously been shown to bind heme in vitro and to promote binding of this compound by Escherichia coli recombinants expressing this protein. The H. influenzae type b heme-binding protein A (HbpA) was found to be highly conserved with respect to both antigenicity and apparent molecular weight among heme-requiring Haemophilus species pathogenic for humans. To further the characterization of the structure and function of HbpA, the complete nucleotide sequence of its gene, hbpA, was determined. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed a single large open reading frame of 1,638 bp encoding a protein of 546 amino acid residues, with a molecular weight of 60,695. The sequence of the amino-terminal end of this protein contained a potential site for lipid acylation and for cleavage by signal peptidase II, consistent with earlier biochemical evidence which indicated that HbpA is a lipoprotein. A search of GenBank for proteins with amino acid sequence similarity to HbpA revealed that the periplasmic dipeptide transport protein of E. coli, DppA, has 53% sequence identity to HbpA.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefquinome, a new cephalosporin, compared with other cephalosporin antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a C-3 bicyclic pyridinium group, was compared with ceftazidime, cefpirome, and cefepime. Cefquinome inhibited members of the Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Salmonella Shigella, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella, and Providencia. Although most Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae were inhibited by less than 2 micrograms/ml, some strains resistant to ceftazidime were resistant, [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) greater than 16 micrograms/ml]. Serratia marcescens were inhibited by less than 1 microgram/ml and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by 8 micrograms/ml similar to the activity of cefepime. The majority of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by less than 0.25 microgram/ml. Most enterococci had cefquinome MICs of 4-8 micrograms/ml. Cefquinome was extremely active against group-A streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae with MICs less than 0.12 microgram/ml. 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus 90% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. Overall, the in vitro activity of cefquinome was comparable with aminothiazolyl cephalosporins. It inhibited some Enterobacter and Citrobacter freundii resistant to ceftazidime as did cefpirome and cefepime. Cefquinome was not destroyed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Klebsiella, Branhamella, and Pseudomonas, but it was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-5, and TEM-9. Its activity was not adversely decreased in different medium or protein, and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) for most species except for Enterobacter were within a dilution of MICs.
TI  - Production and characterisation of mouse monoclonal antibodies reactive with the  lipopolysaccharide core of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to the core antigen region of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were produced from mice immunised with whole cells of heat-killed rough mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa expressing partial or complete core LPS. MAbs were screened in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against three different antigen cocktails: S-form LPS from three P. aeruginosa strains, R-form LPS from six P. aeruginosa strains and, as a negative control, R-form LPS from Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli. Selected MAbs were subsequently screened against a range of extracted LPS and whole cells from both reference strains and clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa. The antibodies were also screened in ELISA against whole-cell antigens from other Pseudomonas spp. as well as strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria subflava and Staphylococcus aureus. Five MAbs reacting with the core component of P. aeruginosa LPS were finally selected. Two of these, MAbs 360.7 and 304.1.4, were particularly reactive in immunoblots against unsubstituted core LPS, including that from O-antigenic serotypes of P. aeruginosa. The MAbs also reacted with some of the other Pseudomonas spp., but not with P. cepacia or Xanthomonas (Pseudomonas) maltophilia. Cross-reactivity with whole cells from other bacterial species was minimal or not observed. Reactivity of MAbs with some Staph. aureus strains was observed, and binding to the protein A component was implicated. The reactivity of the MAbs was investigated further by flow cytometry and immunogold electronmicroscopy. The suitability of the MAbs for an immunological assay for detection of P. aeruginosa in respiratory secretions from CF patients is discussed.
TI  - Performance of Haemophilus Test Media prepared with 12 different lots of Mueller-Hinton agar from four manufacturers.
AB  - Haemophilus Test Media (HTM) were prepared from 12 different lots of Mueller-Hinton agar. When tested with Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247, most lots were initially rejected because of small zones of inhibition for cefaclor, cefuroxime, and cefamandole disks, whereas five other drugs performed satisfactorily on the 11 lots that supported growth of the control strain. At the same time, tests of Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 documented the acceptability of these agar media, with or without HTM supplements. The current control limits for cefaclor, cefuroxime, and cefamandole appear to be unrealistic. Because the beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant control strain of H. influenzae (ATCC 49247) has altered penicillin-binding proteins, it is resistant to ampicillin and is probably also resistant to cefaclor, cefuroxime, and cefamandole. Consequently, media that produce no or very small zones of inhibition with those three drugs might be clinically correct and should not be rejected. One manufacturer provided three lots of Mueller-Hinton agar that gave unusually large zones of inhibition with all beta-lactams. The three other manufacturers provided eight Mueller-Hinton agars that were satisfactory for the preparation of HTM agar, provided that small zones of inhibition with cefaclor, cefuroxime, and cefamandole disks are accepted as the preferred result.
TI  - RU 29 246, the active compound of the cephalosporin-prodrug-ester HR 916. I. Antibacterial activity in vitro.
AB  - The aminothiazolyl-cephalosporin RU 29 246 is the active metabolite of the prodrug-pivaloyl-oxyethyl-ester HR 916. RU 29 246 in vitro activity includes a wide range of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens. Against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococci RU 29 246 (MIC90 of 0.25 approximately 2 micrograms/ml) was clearly more active than cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, cefixime and ceftibuten, but slightly less active than cefdinir. RU 29 246 inhibited hemolytic Streptococci of the serogroups A, B, C and G as well as penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations similar to cefdinir, cefpodoxime and cefuroxime (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.13 micrograms/ml), but less than the other oral cephalosporins investigated (cefixime, cefaclor and ceftibuten). MIC90s of RU 29 246 against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Proteus mirabilis and Haemophilus influenzae were less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. Only RU 29 246 and cefdinir demonstrated moderate activity against Acinetobacter baumannii (MIC90 greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml). Most strains of Pseudomonas spp., Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter spp., Hafnia alvei and Bacteroides spp. were resistant to RU 29 246. RU 29 246 killed Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus at a rate of 99% to 99.9% at concentrations of two times MIC. The pH value of the medium (range 5.5 to 8.5) and the inoculum size (range 10(5) to 10(7) cfu/ml) had no or only low influence on the antibacterial activity of RU 29 246. RU 29 246 is a broad spectrum cephalosporin including in its activity both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens and therefore--depending on the bioavailability of its prodrug--looks promising as to its therapeutic perspective.
TI  - Treatment of severe infectious purpura in children with human plasma from donors  immunized with Escherichia coli J5: a prospective double-blind study. J5 study Group.
AB  - To evaluate the efficacy of anti-J5 serum in the treatment of severe infectious purpura, 73 children were randomized to receive either anti-J5 (40) or control (33) plasma. Age, blood pressure, and biologic risk factors were similar in both groups. At admission, however, tumor necrosis factor serum concentrations were 974 +/- 173 pg/ml compared with 473 +/- 85 pg/ml (P = .023) and interleukin-6 serum concentrations were 129 +/- 45 compared with 19 +/- 5 ng/ml (P = .005) in the control and treated groups, respectively. The duration of shock and the occurrence of complications were similar in both groups. The mortality rate was 36% in the control group and 25% in the treated group (P = .317; odds ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.46-1.26). This trend disappeared after correction for unbalances in risk factors at randomization using a logistic regression model. These results suggest that anti-j5 plasma did not affect the course or mortality of severe infectious purpura in children.
TI  - Protein D, the immunoglobulin D-binding protein of Haemophilus influenzae, is a lipoprotein.
AB  - Protein D is an immunoglobulin D-binding membrane protein exposed on the surface  of the gram-negative bacterium Haemophilus influenzae. Results reported here indicate that protein D is a lipoprotein. The protein is apparently synthesized as a precursor with an 18-residue-long signal sequence modified by the covalent attachment of both ester-linked and amide-linked palmitate to the cysteine residue, which becomes the amino terminus after cleavage of the signal sequence. Globomycin inhibited maturation of protein D in H. influenzae, implying that protein D is exported through the lipoprotein export pathway. A mutant expressing a protein D lacking the cysteine residue was constructed by oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis. The mutated protein D molecule was not acylated and partitioned in the aqueous phase after Triton X-114 extraction of intact bacteria, unlike native and recombinant protein D, which partitioned in the detergent phase. The nonacylated protein D molecule was localized to the periplasmic space of Escherichia coli. The hydrophilic protein D molecule will be used in investigations concerning its ability to function as a vaccine component.
TI  - Lipooligosaccharides (LOS) of some Haemophilus species mimic human glycosphingolipids, and some LOS are sialylated.
AB  - The lipooligosaccharides (LOS) of strains of Haemophilus ducreyi, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Neisseria lactamica contain epitopes that are antigenically and structurally similar to carbohydrates present in human glycosphingolipids. LOS from strains of Haemophilus influenzae and H. influenzae biogroup aegyptius were tested for the binding of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that bind to human glycosphingolipids possessing Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc (MAb 3F11) and Gal alpha 1-4Gal beta 1-4Glc (MAb anti-Pk). In solid-phase radioimmunoassays, the LOS of 18 of 19 H. influenzae type b (Hib), 8 of 19 nontypeable H. influenzae, and 10 of 20 H. influenzae biogroup aegyptius strains bound MAb anti-Pk. The LOS of 13 of 19 Hib, 10 of 16 nontypeable H. influenzae, and 2 of 18 H. influenzae biogroup aegyptius strains bound MAb 3F11. Neuraminidase treatment of the strains increased the binding of MAb 3F11 by more than twofold in 47% of the H. influenzae strains, suggesting that sialic acid occluded the LOS structure recognized by MAb 3F11. The material released from neuraminidase-treated Hib LOS was confirmed to be sialic acid by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography. A recombinant plasmid containing genes involved in Hib LOS biosynthesis directed the expression (assembly) of the 3F11 epitope in Escherichia coli. These studies demonstrate that H. influenzae and H. influenzae biogroup aegyptius express at least two LOS epitopes that are similar to those present in human glycosphingolipids. Sialic acid was present on the LOS of some H. influenzae strains and prevented the binding of MAb 3F11 to its epitope. The oligosaccharide portion of sialylated LOS may also resemble sialylated oligosaccharides present in human glycosphingolipids (gangliosides).
TI  - Conserved immunoglobulin-like features in a family of periplasmic pilus chaperones in bacteria.
AB  - Detailed structural analyses revealed a family of periplasmic chaperones in Gram-negative prokaryotes which are structurally and possibly evolutionarily related to the immunoglobulin superfamily and assist in the assembly of adhesive pili. The members of this family have similar structures consistent with the overall topology of an immunoglobulin fold. Seven pilus chaperone sequences from Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae and Klebsiella pneumoniae were aligned and their consensus sequence was superimposed onto the known three-dimensional structure of PapD, a representative member of the family. The molecular details of the conserved and variable structural motifs in this family of periplasmic chaperones give important insight into their structure, function, mechanism of action and evolutionary relationship with the immunoglobulin superfamily.
TI  - Genome maps of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli.
AB  - Little information concerning the genome of either Campylobacter jejuni or Campylobacter coli is available. Therefore, we constructed genomic maps of C. jejuni UA580 and C. coli UA417 by using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The genome sizes of C. jejuni and C. coli strains are approximately 1.7 Mb, as determined by SalI and SmaI digestion (N. Chang and D. E. Taylor, J. Bacteriol. 172:5211-5217, 1990). The genomes of both species are represented by single circular DNA molecules, and maps were constructed by partial restriction digestion and hybridization of DNA fragments extracted from low-melting-point agarose gels. Homologous DNA probes, encoding the flaAB and 16S rRNA genes, as well as heterologous DNA probes from Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Haemophilus influenzae, were used to identify the locations of particular genes. C. jejuni and C. coli contain three copies of the 16S and 23S rRNA genes. However, they are not located together within an operon but show a distinct split in at least two of their three copies. The positions of various housekeeping genes in both C. jejuni UA580 and C. coli UA417 have been determined, and there appears to be some conservation of gene arrangement between the two species.
TI  - Cross-reactive proteins of Borrelia burgdorferi.
AB  - The specificity of serological tests for Lyme borreliosis is impaired by cross-reacting antibodies. In order to select antigens for more specific tests, specific and cross-reactive proteins of Borrelia burgdorferi must be identified. Therefore, to analyze cross reactions of Borrelia burgdorferi with other bacteria, rabbit immune sera against heterologous bacteria (Borrelia hermsii, Treponema pallidum, Treponema phagedenis, Leptospira interrogans (serogroup grippotyphosa), Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Yersinia enterocolitica (serotypes O3 and O9), Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes O1, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri and Legionella micdadei) were examined by Western blot using Borrelia burgdorferi as antigen. Broad cross reactivity was shown for Borrelia proteins of the 60-75 kDa range. Other broadly cross-reacting proteins were at the level of p40, p33 and two proteins in the range of 20 kDa. Some of the cross reactions were eliminated by absorption of the sera with Treponema phagedenis. The absorbed antibodies were directed mainly against bands at the level of p33 and bands of the 60 to 75 kDa range. Showing the lowest potential for cross reactivity, p100, p41, OspA and pC seem to be the most suitable antigens for serodiagnosis. In contrast to p100 and OspA, however, p41 and pC showed cross reactivity with immune sera against bacteria not belonging to the genus Borrelia.
TI  - Identification of a genetic locus of Haemophilus influenzae type b necessary for  the binding and utilization of heme bound to human hemopexin.
AB  - The mechanism(s) used by Haemophilus influenzae to acquire the essential nutrient heme from its human host has not been elucidated. The heme carried by the high-affinity serum protein hemopexin is one potential source of this micronutrient in vivo. A colony-blot assay revealed that heme-human hemopexin-binding activity was shared among most capsular serotype b strains of H. influenzae but was uncommon among other strains. We have identified a recombinant clone binding heme-human hemopexin from a H. influenzae type b (Hib) genomic library expressed in Escherichia coli. Both the Hib strain and the heme-hemopexin-binding clone expressed a polypeptide of approximately 100 kDa that bound radiolabeled heme-hemopexin. Oligonucleotide linker insertion mutagenesis of the plasmid DNA from this recombinant clone was used to confirm that expression of the 100-kDa protein correlated with the heme-hemopexin-binding activity. Exchange of one of these mutant alleles into the Hib chromosome eliminated expression of both the 100-kDa protein and the heme-hemopexin-binding activity. Furthermore, this Hib mutant was unable to utilize heme-human hemopexin as a heme source.
TI  - The gene encoding cAMP receptor protein is required for competence development in Haemophilus influenzae Rd.
AB  - The Haemophilus influenzae Rd strain JG87 contains a single mini-Tn10kan insertion that causes a deficiency in the development of competence for genetic transformation. The DNA fragment containing this insertion mutation, as well as the wild-type locus, was cloned, mapped, and sequenced. The sequence contained an open reading frame for a protein of 224 amino acids with a predicted Mr of 25,152. The deduced protein sequence showed strong similarity to the Escherichia coli cAMP receptor protein. The E. coli crp gene cloned on a multicopy plasmid was shown to fully complement the competence-deficient phenotype of the mutant strain; thus, the H. influenzae gene was named crp. These results suggest that H. influenzae cAMP-cAMP receptor protein complex functions to regulate one or more promoters essential for the development of competence in H. influenzae Rd. Features of a gene upstream of H. influenzae crp that is homologous to the E. coli ttk gene are also described.
TI  - Immunoglobulin light chain variable region gene sequences for human antibodies to Haemophilus influenzae type b capsular polysaccharide are dominated by a limited number of V kappa and V lambda segments and VJ combinations.
AB  - The immune repertoire to Haemophilus influenzae type b capsular polysaccharide (Hib PS) appears to be dominated by certain light chain variable region genes (IgVL). In order to examine the molecular basis underlying light chain bias, IgVL genes have been cloned from a panel of heterohybridomas secreting human anti-Hib PS (antibody) (anti-Hib PS Ab). One hybridoma, representative of the predominant serum clonotype of anti-Hib PS Ab in older children and adults following immunization or Hib infection, uses a V kappa II segment identical to the germline gene A2, and a JK3 segment. A second kappa hybridoma uses a member of the V kappa I family and a JK4 segment. Four lambda antibodies, all cross-reactive with the structurally related antigen Escherichia coli K100 PS, use V lambda VII segments which are 96-98% homologous to one another, and may originate from a single germline gene. Two additional lambda antibodies, not K100-cross-reactive, are encoded by members of the V lambda II family. All lambda antibodies use highly homologous J lambda 2 or J lambda 3 segments. The VJ joints of all lambda antibodies and the V kappa II-encoded antibody are notable for the presence of an arginine codon, suggesting an important role in antigen binding. Although more complex than heavy chain variable region gene usage, a significant portion of serum anti-Hib PS Ab is likely to be encoded by a limited number of V kappa and V lambda segments and VJ combinations, which may be selectively expressed during development, or following antigen exposure.
TI  - [Bacteriological and clinical studies of panipenem/betamipron in pediatrics].
AB  - We carried out bacteriological and clinical studies of panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP), a newly-developed carbapenem antibiotic, in pediatrics, and the following results were obtained: 1. When antibacterial activities of panipenem (PAPM) were determined, it was found that MICs against such Gram-positive cocci as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae and against such Gram-negative rods as Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Branhamella catarrhalis were all sufficiently low. 2. PAPM showed better MIC-correlated antibacterial activities against 215 subcultured strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) than imipenem. 3. Clinical efficacies were evaluated to be excellent in 23 of 34 patients treated with PAPM/BP, excluding 3 patients from the efficacy evaluation. In addition, good responses were obtained in 10 patients but poor response in one, showing the overall efficacy rate of 97.1%. As for bacteriological efficacies, the eradication rate was also determined to be high, 92.6%. 4. As for side effects, rash appeared in 2 patients, and soft stool and diarrhea occurred in one each. The overall incidence of side effects was calculated to be 10.8%. As for abnormal laboratory findings, increases of eosinophiles in 4 patients, thrombocytes in 2, total bilirubin in 1, and GOT in 1 were observed. From these results, PAPM/BP was thought to be a highly useful drug in pediatrics.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies on panipenem/betamipron in children].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies were performed on panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) in children. The results are summarized as follow: 1. Twelve patients with various bacterial infectious diseases were treated with PAPM/BP. Each dose was 20 mg/20 mg/kg, administered 3 times daily, in 30-minute intravenous drip infusion. Treatments were continued for 5-22 days. Clinical efficacies of PAPM/BP in 12 patients with bacterial infections (1 with suspected sepsis, 5 with pneumonia, 1 with acute maxillary sinusitis, 2 with acute otitis media, 1 with cervical abscess and 2 with urinary tract infection complexed type) were evaluated as excellent in 7, good in 4 and fair in 1, with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. Seventeen causative organisms found in 10 patients (Haemophilus influenzae in 4, Branhamella catarrhalis in 3, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2, Staphylococcus aureus in 1, alpha-Streptococcus in 1, Corynebacterium sp. in 1, Peptostreptococcus micros in 1 and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 2) were eradicated except 2 strains (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa) from 1 patient (patient No. 2). No adverse reactions were observed in any of the 12 patients. 2. MICs of PAPM were examined against 22 clinical isolates (H. influenzae 5, B. catarrhalis 3, alpha-Streptococcus 3, S. pneumoniae 2, Corynebacterium sp. 2, S. aureus 1, P. aeruginosa 1, P. micros 1, Enterobacter cloacae 1, Escherichia coli 1, Group D Streptococcus 1 and Staphylococcus epidermidis 1) from children with bacterial infections. PAPM showed a good antibacterial activity comparable to the activity of cefoperazone (CPZ) against S. pneumoniae strains relatively tolerant to penicillins. However, the activity of PAPM against H. influenzae was somewhat weaker than that of CPZ. 3. Pharmacokinetic studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Tn916 insertion mutagenesis in Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae type b following conjugative transfer.
AB  - Transposon Tn916 was shown to be capable of direct conjugative transfer in broth  and membrane matings between strains of Escherichia coli K12 and between E. coli K12 and Haemophilus influenzae type b. Only Tn916 was transferred, but Tn916 donor ability was not itself inheritable by the recipients and seemed to be associated with the presence of Tn916 on a non-conjugative pBR322-derived vector in the original donor strain. Transfer of Tn916 by conjugation was found to be an efficient method for producing insertion mutations in the chromosome of recipient cells. Although such insertions were unstable when the cells were grown under non-selective conditions, it was possible to show that over 40% of the isolated Tn916 insertions in the chromosome of E. coli K12 were in gene(s) concerned with histidine biosynthesis, implying that there is a partial hot-spot for Tn916 insertion on the E. coli K12 chromosome. When a strain of H. influenzae type b was used as a recipient, out of approximately 1500 transconjugants tested, two mutants were isolated with insertions in genes controlling the expression of iron-regulated transferrin-binding proteins. These mutants constitutively produced major 76 kDa and minor 90 kDa proteins which bound transferrin, even when grown under iron-sufficient conditions. Tn916 insertion mutagenesis, following transfer by conjugation, is a convenient method for isolating mutations in genes concerned with iron acquisition by this important human pathogen.
TI  - [Evaluation of the so-called basic cephalosporins using the serum bactericidal test].
AB  - The serum bactericidal activity (SBA) was studied one hour and four hours after intravenous administration of 1 g and 2 g cefotiam, 1.5 g cefuroxime and 2 g cefazolin to six volunteers. The 136 clinical isolates tested included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Haemophilus influenzae. One hour after administration no significant differences in the activity against staphylococci were noted in the antibiotics tested. Four hours after administration of cefazolin 96% of the Staphylococcus aureus strains were killed at a serum dilution of 1:8, whereas only one strain was killed by cefuroxime and none by cefotiam under the same conditions. The highest SBA-titers against Haemophilus influenzae were achieved with cefotiam at a dosage of 2 g. SBA-titers against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were higher after administration of 1 g cefotiam than after administration of 1.5 g cefuroxime and 2 g cefazolin, respectively.
TI  - A lipoprotein of Yersinia enterocolitica facilitates ferrioxamine uptake in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A cloned fragment of Yersinia enterocolitica DNA complemented the defect in ferrioxamine B uptake of an Escherichia coli fhuE mutant lacking the outer membrane high-affinity transport protein FhuE. Subcloning revealed that a 13.7-kDa outer membrane protein was required for complementation. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence showed extensive homology to PCPHi, an outer membrane lipoprotein of Haemophilus influenzae. We therefore termed this protein PCPYe. Plasmid-encoded pcpY mediated a low-affinity uptake of ferrioxamine B which may be caused by changes in the permeability of the outer membrane due to an overexpression of this outer membrane protein. A transposon insertion mutant in the plasmid-encoded pcpY gene was transferred into the chromosome of Y. enterocolitica. The resulting mutation had no effect on the high-affinity uptake of ferrioxamine B in Yersinia cells. Using the antibiotic ferrimycin we were able to isolate a Y. enterocolitica mutant lacking the high-affinity outer membrane receptor for ferrioxamine uptake, termed FoxA.
TI  - Antigenic diversity in Haemophilus ducreyi as shown by western blot (immunoblot)  analysis.
AB  - The antigenic diversity within a panel of 63 Haemophilus ducreyi isolates was examined by Western blot (immunoblot) analysis with a pool of 238 well-characterized human antisera. When a serum pool adsorbed on a mixture of Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, and H. parahaemolyticus was used, the immunoprofiles suggested that prominent antigenic proteins involved in the human immune response have apparent molecular masses of 63, 42, 34 to 30, and 28.5 to 28 kDa. Preliminary subcellular localization revealed that these antigens are associated with the cellular membrane. Two subsets of antigens were discriminated by detergent extraction. There was no evidence that the antigen composition is altered by changing the growth conditions. With a serum pool adsorbed on the Haemophilus spp. mixture supplemented with Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Pasteurella ureae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Escherichia coli, antigenic determinants more specific for H. ducreyi were identified. An immunodominant 28.5- to 28-kDa protein was expressed by all H. ducreyi isolates. In the range from 34 to 30 kDa, 56 isolates revealed a dominant protein with variable molecular mass. By using both proteins (28.5 to 28 kDa and 34 to 30 kDa) as immunotypic markers, seven different immunopatterns were identified. Antigenic diversity among isolates from different geographical origins as well as from a single area was observed.
TI  - [A study on in vitro antibacterial activity and clinical usefulness in respiratory tract infections of panipenem/betamipron, a newly synthesized carbapenem antibiotic].
AB  - Panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) is a combination drug of PAPM, a new parenteral carbapenem antibiotic and BP, an amino acid derivative at a weight ratio of 1:1. Its in vitro antibacterial activities against clinically isolated respiratory pathogenic bacteria were determined. It was superior to imipenem (IPM) in the in vitro antibacterial activities against Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli. PAPM had antibacterial activities almost equal to those of IPM against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus spp. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, its antibacterial activity was about 1/4 that of IPM. The clinical usefulness of PAPM/BP was studied by dissolving it in a solution containing lactate and administering the solution by intravenous drip infusion to 12 cases of respiratory tract infections. Out of 11 cases with respiratory tract infections excluding cytomegalovirus pneumonia, the efficacy rate was 90.9%, with 4 cases of excellent and 6 cases of good responses. In terms of its bacteriological efficacies, eradication of pathogenic bacteria including super-infection were observed in 2 out of 4 strains, but 2 strains of P. aeruginosa remained unchanged. Six strains appeared as superinfected bacteria during and after administration of this preparation substituting original pathogens. Side-effects were not observed in the 12 cases, and in laboratory tests, slight transient increases of S-GOT and S-GPT were found in 1 case. In conclusion, PAPM/BP is a very useful parenteral antibiotic against respiratory tract infections and can be one of the drugs of the first choice.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the investigational oral and parenteral cephalosporin BK-218.
AB  - BK-218 is a novel cephalosporin with a dual route of administration and spectrum  of activity most similar to that of second-generation cephalosporins. BK-218 was active against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis but strains resistant to penicillins had higher MICs. BK-218 had greater activity (8-fold) than cefuroxime or cefaclor against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus spp. Moderate BK-218 activity was observed against Neisseria gonorrhoeae and commonly isolated Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli (MIC90, 1 mg/l), Klebsiella spp. (MIC90, 2 mg/l), and Proteus mirabilis (MIC90, 2 mg/l). The following organisms were generally BK-218-resistant (MIC90, greater than 16 mg/l): Bacteroides fragilis, Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., Xanthomonas maltophilia, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., indole-positive Proteus, Serratia spp., enterococci and oxacillin-resistant staphylococci.
TI  - Cefetamet pivoxil: a review of its microbiology, toxicology, pharmacokinetics and clinical efficacy.
AB  - Cefetamet pivoxil is an oral, third-generation cephalosporin whose broad spectrum of antibacterial activity and favorable pharmacokinetic profile make it particularly suitable for the treatment of a wide range of infectious diseases. Cefetamet has high in vitro activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria that cause a number of respiratory tract and urinary tract infections. These include penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus spp, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus spp., Klebsiella spp. and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It is not active against staphylococci, enterococci, Pseudomonas spp. or Bacteroides fragilis but does inhibit most bile-sensitive (oral) Bacteroides spp. Animal toxicology studies indicate that neither cefetamet pivoxil nor the active compound cefetamet have significant teratogenic, mutagenic, photogenic or allergenic potential. Cefetamet is eliminated unchanged in the urine with a half-life of 2.2 h. Volume of distribution approximates the extracellular fluid space (0.3 1/kg), protein binding is minima (22%) and oral bioavailability of cefetamet pivoxil is approximately 50% when taken with food. No significant drug interactions have been noted to date. The efficacy and tolerability of cefetamet pivoxil have been evaluated in the treatment of gram-positive and gram-negative infections in almost 5,000 patients. In comparative studies, cefetamet pivoxil was at least as effective, and in many cases clinically superior, to most currently recommended antibiotics for the treatment of urinary tract infections including gonorrhea and complicated infections in high risk patients. Efficacy has also been demonstrated in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, pneumonia and infections of the ear, nose and throat. Clinical trials have shown that a 7 day treatment period with cefetamet pivoxil is as effective as a 10 day course of phenoxymethylpenicillin in the treatment of pharyngotonsillitis. Cefetamet pivoxil has been well-tolerated in clinical trials with only 1.2% of patients on standard doses discontinuing therapy prematurely. The most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting) which occur in less than 10% of patients. Many current antibiotic treatment regimens involve the administration of three or more daily doses. However, standard doses of cefetamet pivoxil 500 mg twice daily provide unbound plasma concentrations of cefetamet which generally exceed the MIC(90) for susceptible organisms throughout the dosing interval and have been demonstrated to be clinically effective. This should result in good compliance with therapy in out-patients. Dosing regimens for cefetamet pivoxil should be adjusted in patients with impaired renal function while standard doses can be given to elderly patients and those with liver disease. Standard doses in children are 10 mg/kg or alternatively, children may receive a dose reduced in proportion to the ratio of their body surface area to that of an adult.
TI  - [Purification, amino acid composition and N-terminal sequence of the major protein (protein H) of the outer membrane of Pasteurella multocida].
AB  - The major protein (protein H) of the outer membrane of Pasteurella multocida was  purified by size-exclusion chromatography after selective extraction with detergents. The protein forms homotrimers which are stable in the presence of SDS at room temperature. Upon treatment at 100 degrees C, the protein is fully dissociated by the detergent into monomers exhibiting an apparent molecular mass of 37 kDa as estimated by electrophoresis. The amino acid composition of protein H is characterized by a low hydropathy index (HI = -0.40) and is strongly related to the compositions of bacterial porins, notably porins P2 (Haemophilus influenzae), PIA (Neisseria gonorrhoeae) and Cl.2 ("class 2 porin" of N. meningitidis). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of protein H shares a strong homology with those of porins OmpC (Escherichia coli) and P2. These data indicate that protein H of P. multocida is a porin belonging to the superfamily of the non-specific porins of Gram-negative eubacteria outer membrane.
TI  - Photosensitization by 2-chloro-3,11-tridecadiene-5,7,9-triyn-1-ol: damage to erythrocyte membranes, Escherichia coli, and DNA.
AB  - The natural product 2-chloro-3,11-tridecadiene-5,7,9-triyn-1-ol (1) photosensitized the inactivation of Escherichia coli in the presence of near-ultraviolet light (320-400 nm; NUV) under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. A series of E. coli strains differing in DNA repair capabilities and catalase proficiency exhibited indistinguishable inactivation kinetics following treatment with the chemical plus NUV. The presence of carotenoids did afford some protection to E. coli against inactivation under aerobic conditions, consistent with the involvement of singlet oxygen. The photosensitized hemolysis of human erythrocytes occurred more rapidly in the absence than in the presence of oxygen. Aerobically, the onset of hemolysis was partially inhibited by NaN3 and by 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT) but not by superoxide dismutase (SOD). The aerobic lipid peroxidation observed in the membranes of erythrocyte ghosts was completely inhibited by BHT, and partially by NaN3, but not by SOD. These results suggest that either lipid peroxidation of the membrane is not the main cause of photohemolysis or that BHT has insufficient access to intact erythrocyte lipids to protect them. Aerobically, crosslinking of membrane proteins was also observed; it was not affected by SOD, but was partially inhibited by BHT and NaN3. The anaerobic photosensitized hemolysis of erythrocytes was more rapid; a radical mechanism was suggested since BHT inhibited the hemolysis to a greater extent than under aerobic conditions. Neither lipid peroxidation nor protein crosslinking was observed under conditions believed to be anaerobic. A light-dependent electron transfer to cytochrome c was obtained under argon but not under oxygen. Although induced mutations were not observed in the experiments with E. coli, 1 was capable of damaging both supercoiled pBR322 and Haemophilus influenzae transforming DNA in a manner that seemed to be equivalent under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In conclusion, 1 can behave as typical photodynamic molecule under aerobic conditions but, in contrast to most photodynamic molecules, it is also phototoxic under anaerobic conditions. The extent to which the radical reactions detected under anaerobic reactions compete with the photodynamic processes when oxygen is present is not known.
TI  - Comparative activity of meropenem (SM-7338) against major respiratory pathogens and amikacin-resistant nosocomial isolates.
AB  - Meropenem, a new broad-spectrum carbapenem antibiotic, demonstrated excellent in  vitro activity against major respiratory pathogens including Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of meropenem for Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae isolates were frequently less than those of imipenem. For nosocomial amikacin-resistant gram-negative bacilli, meropenem had eightfold lower MIC90 values compared to imipenem against strains of Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli; it was 32-fold more active than imipenem against Proteus mirabilis isolates. Activity was similar to that of imipenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. Overall, meropenem showed excellent activity against common community-acquired pathogens as well as amikacin-resistant nosocomial pathogens.
TI  - Changes in lymphocyte subpopulations in patients treated with cefodizime for acute lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - The influence of cefodizime (CDZ) on CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes was investigated in  patients with lower respiratory tract infection and underlying respiratory diseases. Ten men and one woman were treated with CDZ 1 g i.m. b.i.d. for ten days. The infecting organisms were Haemophilus influenzae (5), Streptococcus pneumoniae (2) and Escherichia coli (1). No adverse events were reported. Nine patients were clinically cured; two required further antibiotic therapy. Leucocyte counts decreased significantly during treatment. Lymphocyte counts and CD4 cells both increased significantly in absolute and relative numbers, while there was a much smaller increase in CD8 cells. This resulted in a significant increase in the CD4/CD8 ratio. These effects of CDZ might be of benefit for immunocompromised patients with bacterial infections.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetics and clinical effects of cefdinir 10% fine granules in pediatrics].
AB  - Cefdinir (CFDN), a newly developed oral cephalosporin in a 10% fine granular form, was administered to 8 children and concentrations of the drug in plasma and urine and urinary recovery rates of the drug were determined. The subjects were divided into 2 groups of 4 children each; one group received 3 mg/kg of CFDN at 1 hour before meal (in the fasting state), and the other, at 30 minutes after meal. To study clinical and bacteriological effects of this drug, a mean dose of 4.8 mg/kg t.i.d. was administered for 8 days on the average to 9 children with various infections; tonsillitis (3 cases), acute bronchitis (1), pneumonia (1), acute purulent otitis media (1), urinary tract infection (2), and impetigo (1). MICs were determined for 6 drugs including CFDN, cefaclor, cefixime (CFIX), methicillin, cloxacillin, amoxicillin (AMPC) against 4 strains freshly isolated from children receiving CFDN. An inoculum size of 10(6) cfu/ml was used in the MIC-determinations. Adverse reactions and abnormal laboratory findings attributable to this drug were also examined in these children. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Mean plasma peak levels of CFDN were observed at 2 hours after administration in the before-meal group and 4 or 5 hours after administration in the after-meal group mean peak values of 0.88 and 0.50 micrograms/ml, respectively. Mean half-lives were 1.61 hours in the before-meal group and 2.54 hours in the after-meal group, and mean AUCs were 4.24 in the former and 3.59 micrograms.hr/ml in the latter. 2. Mean urinary peak concentrations of CFDN were observed during 2-4 hours after dosing in the before-meal group and during 6-8 hours in the after-meal group with values of 93.3 and 44.8 micrograms/ml, respectively, in cases for which plasma concentrations of drugs were determined. Mean urinary recovery rates during the first 8 hours after administration in the before- and after-meal groups were 16.6 and 13.4%, respectively. 3. Good clinical effects were obtained with an efficacy rate of 100% in 9 patients with 6 diseases due to bacterial infections. 4. Good bacteriological effects were also obtained against 2 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 2 strains of Escherichia coli and 1 strain of Haemophilus influenzae with an eradication rate of 100%. In 3 cases of these and another case (normal flora), strains present before the study were replaced by other strains.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of 5% and 10% granules of  cefdinir in the pediatric field].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefdinir (CFDN, FK482),  a new oral cephalosporin, 5% and 10% granules, were performed in the field of pediatrics. The results are summarized below. 1. Antibacterial activities Antibacterial activities of CFDN against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were studied in comparison with those of cefaclor (CCL), cefixime (CFIX) and amoxicillin (AMPC). MIC80's of CFDN against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, H. influenzae, B. catarrhalis, K. pneumoniae and E. coli were 0.78, 0.20, less than or equal to 0.025, 0.39, 0.10, 0.20 and 0.10 micrograms/ml, respectively. These results show that CFDN has high antibacterial activities against these organisms. MIC80's of CFDN against Gram-positive bacteria were similar to those of AMPC, and was lower than those of CCL and CFIX. As for antibacterial activities against Gram-negative bacteria (GNB), the MIC80 of CFIX against H. influenzae was 0.05 micrograms/ml, which was slightly lower than that of CFDN. THe MIC80's of CFDN against other GNB were similar to those of CFIX. 2. Absorption and excretion Blood concentrations and urinary excretion rates of CFDN 5% and 10% granules and 100 mg capsule were determined. The data on CFDN 10% granules were similar to those on CFDN 5% granules. At a dose of 3 mg/kg, peak blood concentrations (Cmax's) of CFDN ranged from 0.20 to 2.12 micrograms/ml with 5% granules and from 0.50 to 1.15 micrograms/ml with 10% granules at 2 to 3 hours after dosing. At a dose of 6 mg/kg, peak concentrations were 0.66-2.06 micrograms/ml and 0.70-1.52 micrograms/ml with 5% granules and with 10% granules, respectively. At 8 hours after dosing, blood concentrations were 0.04-0.54 micrograms/ml at 3 mg/kg and 0.06-0.27 micrograms/ml at 6 mg/kg. Blood half-lives were 1.33-4.36 hours at 3 mg/kg and 1.14-3.27 hours at 6 mg/kg. AUC's were 1.7-11.0 micrograms.hr/ml with 3 mg/kg and 2.4-8.7 micrograms.hr/ml with 6 mg/kg. With administration of single 100 mg capsule, Cmax's, blood concentrations after 8 hours, T1/2's and AUC's were 0.79-1.88 micrograms/ml, 0.20 micrograms/ml, 1.54-2.72 hours, and 5.2 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. Urinary recovery rates in the first 8 hours ranged from 6.85 to 39.2% with 3 mg/kg and 6.08-25.5% with 6 mg/kg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Problems and dilemmas of antimicrobial resistance.
AB  - An important obstacle to the long-term efficacy of an antimicrobial agent is the  appearance and spread of resistance to the agent. The fact that many antimicrobials are produced by microorganisms in nature may provide long-term selective pressure for the emergence of resistance in antibiotic-producing as well as -nonproducing organisms. Indeed, the rapidity with which many resistances have appeared after the introduction of a new antibiotic suggests that these resistance genes were already present somewhere in nature prior to clinical use. In the hospital setting, the most recent worrisome resistance traits to emerge include plasmid-mediated resistance to imipenem and to third-generation cephalosporins among nosocomial gram-negative bacteria, and the acquisition of resistance to vancomycin by enterococci. Methicillin-resistant staphylococci continue to be a problem and are increasingly resistant to numerous other agents such as rifampin and the newer fluoroquinolones. The most important resistances seen in community-acquired organisms include beta-lactam resistance in pneumococci and combined ampicillin and chloramphenicol resistance in Haemophilus influenzae. Shigellae resistant to essentially all commonly used oral agents are also a problem, particularly in developing countries. No end is in sight to the problem of antimicrobial resistance, and thus new strategies to prevent infections and control resistant organisms continue to be necessary.
TI  - Bactericidal activity and postantibiotic effect of cefdinir (Cl 983, FK 482) against selected pathogens.
AB  - The bactericidal activity and the postantibiotic effect (PAE) of cefdinir (Cl 983, FK 482) (CDR), were determined against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis and Escherichia coli (5 strains each) in comparison to erythromycin (E), cotrimoxazole (SXT) and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AMC). Kinetic studies of kill showed that CDR was rapidly bactericidal at concentrations 2 and 4 times the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC): a reduction of 99.9% in CFU values was observed after 6-8 h for many of the isolates tested. As expected, a PAE was observed when S. aureus was treated with CDR at MIC (range of individual values for 5 strains 0.8-1.5 h) and 4 x MIC (range 1.1-1.4 h). Moreover, CDR showed a significant PAE at both its MIC and 4 x MIC against S. pneumoniae (range 0.5-1.0 h and 0.9-1.1 h), H. influenzae (range 0.4-0.7 h and 0.4-0.8 h), B. catarrhalis (range 0.5-0.7 h and 0.65-0.95 h) and E. coli (range 0.5-0.6 h and 0.5-0.7 h). The good bactericidal activity and the significant PAE of CDR against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (including respiratory pathogens) are a promising indication for the clinical efficacy of this cephalosporin in several bacterial infections.
TI  - Copper-zinc superoxide dismutase of Haemophilus influenzae and H. parainfluenzae.
AB  - Copper-zinc superoxide dismutase ([Cu,Zn]-SOD) is widely found in eukaryotes but  has only rarely been identified in bacteria. Here we describe sodC, encoding [Cu,Zn]-SOD in Haemophilus influenzae and H. parainfluenzae, frequent colonists and pathogens of the human respiratory tract. In capsulate H. influenzae, sodC was found in only one division of the bacterial population, and although the protein it encoded was clearly [Cu,Zn]-SOD from its deduced sequence, it lacked enzymatic activity. In H. parainfluenzae, in contrast, active enzyme was synthesized which appeared to be secreted beyond the cytoplasm when the gene was expressed in Escherichia coli minicells. The origin of gene transcription differed between the Haemophilus species, but protein synthesis from cloned genes in vitro was comparable. A C-T transition was found in the H. influenzae sequence compared with the H. parainfluenzae sequence, leading to a histidine, known to be crucial in eukaryotic [Cu,Zn]-SOD for copper ion coordination and so for enzymatic activity, to be changed to tyrosine. This is speculated to be the cause of inactivity of the H. influenzae enzyme. Secreted SODs have only been described in a few bacterial species, and this is the first identification of [Cu,Zn]-SOD in a common human upper respiratory tract colonist. The role of secreted bacterial SODs is unknown, and we speculate that in Haemophilus species the enzyme may confer survival advantage by accelerating dismutation of superoxide of environmental origin to hydrogen peroxide, disruptive to the normal mucociliary clearance process in the host.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents, 1989. A study mainly focused on imipenem. The Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibilities of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1989. The susceptibility testing was carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: (+++), (++), (+) and (-). IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Bacteroides fragilis and had rather strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Achromobacter xylosoxidans, but was less active to Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Xanthomonas maltophilia. IPM has been found to have activities superior to those of other antibiotics tested against E. faecalis, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa and B. fragilis. No antibiotics tested showed good activities against MRSA except minocycline.
TI  - New macrolides: expanded horizons for an old class of antibiotics.
AB  
TI  - Interaction of imipenem with erythromycin and tetracycline assessed by microdilution checkerboard techniques.
AB  - Microdilution methodology was used to study the interaction of imipenem with erythromycin and tetracycline, a combination therapy that might be used for the treatment of serious pelvic inflammatory disease. The combination of imipenem and erythromycin showed no antagonism for Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae but was antagonistic for Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and group B streptococci; the combination of imipenem and tetracycline was antagonistic for all strains except H. influenzae. Correlation between the results of kill curves and the measurement of fractional bactericidal concentration (FBC) indices was good, although FBC indices showed less antagonism than kill curves. Fractional inhibitory concentration indices showed poor correlation, rarely showing antagonism, and indeed showed synergy in three cases. If erythromycin or tetracycline is considered necessary in addition to imipenem in the treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease, it is probably more effective when given after the course of imipenem has been completed.
TI  - Ampicillin/sulbactam in lower respiratory tract infections: a review.
AB  - The pathophysiology and microbiology of lower respiratory tract infections are outlined and diagnostic and therapeutic problems considered. The use of sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of these infections is evaluated. The two drugs have similar pharmacokinetic characteristics; predictable and dose-dependent peak serum concentrations of both agents are achieved after parenteral administration. More than 90% of strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella sp, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter sp were inhibited by ampicillin/sulbactam concentrations of 16/8 micrograms/ml. Serum concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam were 18 to 28 micrograms/ml and 13 micrograms/ml, respectively, after intramuscular administration of 1 gm/0.5 gm of ampicillin/sulbactam and 58 micrograms/ml and 30 micrograms/ml, respectively, after intravenous administration of the same dose. Good distribution of ampicillin/sulbactam into lung tissue, sputum, and bronchial fluid has been demonstrated. In over 2,250 patients treated with ampicillin/sulbactam, the rate of discontinuance of treatment because of side effects was less than 1%. Satisfactory clinical and bacteriologic outcome has been reported in over 80% of patients treated with ampicillin/sulbactam. The cost of ampicillin/sulbactam treatment is generally lower than that of other comparable antibiotic regimens.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical evaluations of flomoxef sodium in neonates].
AB  - Flomoxef sodium (FMOX) was evaluated experimentally and clinically in neonates. 1. Serum concentrations and urinary excretions of the drug were examined after a bolus intravenous injection at 20 mg/kg to 22 neonates 1-30 days after birth (durations of pregnancy 31-43 weeks, weights at birth 1,650-4,040 g) and 5 infants 50-95 days after birth (durations of pregnancy 33-40 weeks, weights at birth 1,720-3,308 g). Serum concentrations were 10.8-67.6 micrograms/ml (mean 32.7 +/- 2.8 micrograms/ml) and 25.1-52.0 micrograms/ml (mean 38.9 +/- 4.3 micrograms/ml) in the neonates and the infants, respectively, at their peaks (0.5 hour value), decreased thereafter with half-lives of 0.96-5.59 hours (mean 2.20 +/- 0.26 hours value), and 0.97-1.54 hours (mean 1.22 +/- 0.12 hours value), respectively. Serum levels decreased to 0.2-17.1 micrograms/ml (mean 2.9 +/- 0.6 micrograms/ml) and N.D. -1.1 micrograms/ml (mean 0.4 +/- 0.2 micrograms/ml) after 8 hours, respectively. The urinary recovery rates of the drug in the first 8 hours after administration were 15.0-96.0% (mean 53.7 +/- 4.9%) and 29.9-73.3% (mean 62.4 +/- 9.4%) in the neonates and in the infants, respectively. 2. FMOX was administered to 78 neonates (durations of pregnancy 31-42 weeks, weights at birth 1,420-3,860 g) in whom bacterial infections were established or suspected, and clinical, bacteriological, and side effects were evaluated. In 47 neonates examined (1 with sepsis, 3 with acute upper respiratory infections, 18 with acute pneumonia, 1 with umbilical infection, 1 with impetigo, 4 with acute urinary tract infections, 1 with acute otitis externa, 1 with periproctal abscess, and 17 with intrauterine infections), the treatment was markedly effective in 41, and effective in 6, with an overall efficacy rate of 100%. The bacterilogical effects of the drug on 3 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 1 strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 strain of Streptococcus agalactiae, 9 strains of Escherichia coli, and 2 strains of Haemophilus influenzae which were responsible for these infections were all rated as "eradicated". Moreover, the drug, administered with or without prophylactic intentions showed complete prophylactic effects in all 27 cases tested. No side effects were observed in any of the patients. Concerning abnormal clinical laboratory results, increases in GOT were noted in 2, eosinophilia in 1, and thrombocytosis in 1, but these abnormalities were invariably mild and the normalized in 1 patient without treatment. The results suggest that FMOX is useful and safe also in neonates.
TI  - Direct identification of bacterial isolates in blood cultures by using a DNA probe.
AB  - This study involved the rapid, direct identification of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterococcus sp., and Streptococcus agalactiae from positive blood culture bottles (BACTEC, Johnston Laboratories, Inc.) by using the AccuProbe (Gen-Probe, San Diego, Calif.) culture confirmation test. This method uses a chemiluminescent DNA probe that detects the rRNA of the target organisms. The manufacturer's instructions were modified to use a pellet of bacteria made directly from positive blood culture broth rather than a colony from an agar plate. Two separate procedures of selective centrifugation were employed in order to obtain the pellet. The first utilized a routine clinical centrifuge and a large volume of broth (10 to 12 ml) from the blood culture bottle. The second method used a microcentrifuge and less volume (1 to 1.5 ml). A total of 196 clinical specimens taken directly from positive blood culture broths were correctly identified by AccuProbe from pellets made by using the clinical centrifuge technique, while 166 clinical specimens used as negative controls failed to show hybridization. The microcentrifuge technique for obtaining pellets was performed on 105 patient specimens, and all were correctly identified. When combined with the microcentrifuge technique for pellet preparation, the AccuProbe test has several advantages: (i) direct identification of bacteria from blood culture broths, (ii) rapid turn-around time (30 min), (iii) simplicity of the procedure, and (iv) relative low cost.
TI  - Clinical results of a multicenter study with sulbactam/ampicillin for the treatment of patients with lower respiratory and urinary tract infections.
AB  - A total of 124 patients with lower respiratory tract (44) or urinary tract infections (80) were enrolled in an open, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sulbactam/ampicillin, administered at the dosage of 3 g/die by intramuscular route. Pretreatment pathogens from patients with lower respiratory tract infections included: Streptococcus alpha-haemolyticus in 8 cases, Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus in 2 cases, Staphylococcus albus in 7 cases, Haemophilus influenzae in 7 cases, Staphylococcus aureus in 6 cases, Klebsiella oxytoca in 5 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 cases, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 3 cases, Escherichia coli in 2 cases; in one subject (2.75%), no microorganisms were isolated. In vitro, 36 isolates (84%) were sensitive to SA and 7 (16%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, all the causative pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated. In patients with urinary tract infections, pretreatment pathogens were: E. coli in 40 cases, S. albus in 16 cases, Proteus mirabilis in 8 cases, Enterobacter agglomerans in 6 cases, Proteus vulgaris in 3 cases, Streptococcus faecalis in 3 cases, Streptococcus liquefaciens in 2 cases, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2 cases. In vitro, 64 isolates (80%) were sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin and 16 (20%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, 63 out of the 64 pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated; in one case the therapy was interrupted due to adverse effect. Clinical efficacy: in subjects with lower respiratory tract infections, sulbactam/ampicillin cured 32 patients (72.72%) and ameliorated the clinical status of 8 patients (18.18%); efficacy rate: 90.9%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefdinir fine granules  in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - The Pharmacokinetics and clinical effectiveness of cefdinir (CFDN, FK482) were examined in pediatric patients. The results are summarized as follows. 1. Plasma concentrations and urinary excretions of CFDN after administration of 5% fine granules were investigated on 4 children at a dose level of 6 mg/kg. Average plasma concentrations peaked at 4 hours after administration at 0.99 micrograms/ml with a half-life of 2.12 hours. The first 24-hour urinary recovery rates of CFDN in 3 children averaged 22.0%. 2. CFDN was given to 24 children (11 with pharyngitis, 3 with tonsillitis, 8 with scarlet fever, 1 with urinary tract infection and 1 with enteritis due to Salmonella); 15 were treated with 5% fine granules and 9 with 10% fine granules at daily doses of about 10 mg/kg in 2 to 3 divided portions. Clinical effects were excellent in 16, good in 7 and not evaluable in 1, with an overall efficacy rate of 100%. 3. Identified causative organisms were 12 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 4 of Haemophilus influenzae, 5 of Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 1 of Escherichia coli, and 1 of Salmonella. Bacteriological effects were rated as "eradicated" for 19 strains, "unchanged" for 4 with an eradication rate of 82.6%. 4. No side effects were observed. As for abnormal laboratory test results, a transient decrease of white blood cells was observed in 1 patient. 5. The CFDN fine granule preparations were preferably accepted by the children. 6. The fine granular preparations of CFDN, a new oral antibiotic, were useful for the treatment of bacterial infections in pediatrics.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefdinir 5% fine granules in pediatrics].
AB  - Clinical evaluation in pediatrics on cefdinir (CFDN, FK482) (5% fine granules), a new oral cephem, was performed. 1. CFDN was administered to 112 pediatric patients with ages between 1 month to 13 years with various infections. Dose levels used were 3.0-8.9 mg/kg (mean 5.1 mg/kg) t.i.d. for 3-14 days (mean 6.7 days). The studied patients included 2 patients with scarlet fever, 6 with acute pharyngitis, 6 with acute rhinopharyngitis, 52 with acute purulent tonsillitis, 8 with acute bronchitis, 24 with acute pneumonia, 7 with acute urinary tract infections, 1 with acute vaginitis, and 6 with impetigo. Total doses ranged from 0.6 to 4.05 g. One hundred eleven of the 112 patients were evaluated for clinical efficacy and all the patients were evaluated for safety. 2. Clinical effects were excellent in 51 cases, good in 57, and fair in 3 with an extremely high efficacy rate of 97.3%. Efficacy rates were 100% in scarlet fever, acute pharyngitis, acute purulent tonsillitis, acute bronchitis, acute vaginitis and impetigo, and 83.3%, 95.7%, 85.7% in acute rhinopharyngitis, acute pneumonia, and acute urinary tract infections, respectively. Good clinical effects were observed regardless of diseases. 3. Causative organisms were identified in 79 cases, of which 71 were found to be monobacterial infections and 8 were found to be multi-bacterial infections. In mono-bacterial infections, clinical efficacies were 100% for those caused by Staphylococcus aureus/Streptococcus pyogenes/Streptococcus pneumoniae/beta-Streptococcus except those in A and B groups with an overall efficacy of 100% against Gram-positive cocci (GPC) and they were 89.5%, 100%, 100% for those caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and Escherichia coli, respectively, with an overall efficacy of 90.3% in Gram-negative rods (GNR). In multi-bacterial infections also, a clinical efficacy of 100% was obtained. 4. Bacteriological effects were studied for 89 strains in the 79 cases. The eradication rate for a few strains of S. pneumoniae was low, 25%, but it was 100% for S. aureus, with the same results for S. pyogenes, and beta-Streptococcus. The eradication rate on GPC was high 94.1%. Among GNR, 66.7% of E. coli, 50.0% of H. influenzae, and 71.4% of H. parainfluenzae was eradicated. The overall eradication rate for GNR was 55.3%, lower than that for GPC. Microbial substitutions were observed in 13 cases, with Haemophilus sp. replacing other bacteria. 5. Diarrhea and soft stools were noted in 4 and 2 patients, respectively. The severity of these side effects, however, was slight and it was possible to continue the CFDN treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Analysis of Haemophilus influenzae type b lipooligosaccharide-synthesis genes that assemble or expose a 2-keto-3-deoxyoctulosonic acid epitope.
AB  - We recently isolated a recombinant phage from a Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) library that assembles an oligosaccharide with an apparent molecular weight of 1400 (1.4 K) on a 4.1 K Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) structure, producing a 5.5 K LPS species that contains a KDO (2-keto-deoxyoctulosonic acid) epitope. Subcloning and deletional analysis of the 14 kb Haemophilus insert showed that three overlapping restriction fragments contained within a 7.2 kb Pstl-BamHl fragment sequentially modified an E. coli 4.1 K LPS structure, generating novel species of 4.5 K, 5.1 K and 5.5 K. Only the 5.5 K species contained the KDO epitope. We confirmed the relationship between the cloned genes and Hib lipooligosaccharide (LOS) biosynthesis by constructing a mutant that expressed an altered LOS. Thus, the Hib 7.2 kb Pstl-BamHl restriction fragment contained a cluster of at least three genetic loci whose products acted sequentially in LOS biosynthesis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.
AB  - Tazobactam (YTR 830), a new beta-lactamase inhibitor, was evaluated for its effect in combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum, but beta-lactamase sensitive, penicillin, against 14 common bacteria. A total of 1,086 clinical isolates from different clinical specimens were tested for beta-lactamase production by the rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method. Their susceptibilities to piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam in a ratio of 8:1 by the agar dilution method were evaluated. The percentage of beta-lactamase producing strains ranged from 14.5% to 100% in these tested species. In general, the beta-lactamase producers were more resistant to piperacillin than the beta-lactamase nonproducers with higher minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). For the beta-lactamase producers, tazobactam decreased the MICs of piperacillin prominently in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Salmonella species and Bacteroides fragilis, with a 4-fold or greater decrease in MIC50, MIC90 and the geometric mean of MIC. For Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MICs did not change after adding tazobactam. For other species, there was a moderate decrease in MICs. We conclude that tazobactam is an effective beta-lactamase inhibitor for increasing the antimicrobial activity of piperacillin against beta-lactamase producing strains of many species of bacteria.
TI  - Lack of emergence of significant resistance in vitro and in vivo to the new azalide antibiotic azithromycin.
AB  - In vitro experiments were performed in which 6 to 12 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae and Enterobacteriaceae were passaged nine times in sub-lethal concentrations of azithromycin or control antibiotics. Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus quickly became resistant to rifampin as the MIC90 increased from 0.1 to greater than 50 micrograms/ml for both species. The MIC90 of azithromycin, erythromycin, amoxicillin and cefaclor increased by three dilutions for Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC values of azithromycin for Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae and Enterobacteriaceae strains did not change significantly. However, for Haemophilus influenzae and the Enterobacteriaceae strains, the MIC values of erythromycin and oral cephalosporins increased four-fold. In the in vivo experiments, mice infected with Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli contaminated sutures were administered azithromycin for three days, and on day 6 viable bacterial cells were recovered from the infection site. The sustained tissue concentrations of azithromycin indicated that the organisms would have been continuously exposed to azithromycin at the site of infection. Colonies isolated from azithromycin-treated and non-treated mice were cultured and their susceptibility to azithromycin compared. The azithromycin MIC values for Staphylococcus aureus cultures from treated and non-treated animals were identical. The azithromycin MICs for Escherichia coli recovered from treated animals were on average, less than one dilution higher than for control cultures. Emergence of significant resistance to azithromycin in the laboratory was not observed with the pathogens tested.
TI  - [Beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations for oral administration].
AB  - Beta-lactamase inhibitors are compounds which are able to bind many beta-lactamase and to inactivate them irreversibly ("suicide inactivators"). Their intrinsic antimicrobial activity is weak. However, in combination with aminopenicillins they exhibit marked synergism both in vitro and in vivo against many beta-lactamase producing bacterial strains. At the achievable serum and tissue concentrations after oral administration, various aminopenicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations are active against many strains of beta-lactamase producing Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Bacteroides fragilis and staphylococci. At levels achievable in the urine, they are also active against many strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus spp. and Klebsiella spp. Clinically, they have been shown to be effective in the treatment of various human infections of the urinary tract, airways, skin, soft tissues, ear and sinuses. Mild gastrointestinal disturbances are the most commonly encountered side effects. Aminopenicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations may be a suitable therapeutic option in treating mild to moderately severe infections, i.e. in an outpatient setting.
TI  - Microbiology of chronic sinusitis in children.
AB  - To better understand the factors involved in chronic sinusitis in childhood, we cultured the sinuses, middle meatus, and nasopharynx in 39 children requiring surgical intervention. Sixty-nine percent of these patients had other medical problems, including asthma (49%) and immunologic compromise (18%). We cultured coagulase-negative staphylococcus in 18 patients, Streptococcus viridans in 14 patients, normal flora in 10 patients, Staphylococcus aureus in nine patients, group D streptococcus in five patients, Corynebacterium in five patients, Haemophilus influenzae in three patients, Neisseria in three patients, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca, Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces, and an anaerobic gram-negative bacillus in one patient each. Cultures yielded no growth in nine patients. A strong association between cultures of the middle meatus obtained ipsilaterally and cultures of the maxillary (83%) and ethmoid sinuses (80%) occurred. A poor correlation was found between cultures of the nasopharynx and maxillary (45%) and ethmoid sinuses (49%). All seven patients who had both maxillary and ethmoid sinus cultures showed the same organisms in both sinuses. Only 41% of organisms were found on both sides when procedures were performed bilaterally. Cultures of the middle meatus appear to be sensitive and specific for organisms within sinuses. The presence of predominantly nonvirulent organisms in low titers suggests that additional factors other than bacterial overgrowth contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic sinusitis in children.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of ofloxacin against recent isolates from patients with community-acquired infections].
AB  - In order to survey antibacterial activities of ofloxacin (OFLX) against 1,440 bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired infections in 1987 and 1990, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the drug as well as those of other new quinolones and oral cephems were determined. The following conclusions were reached. 1. Comparison of the MIC distribution for strains isolated in 1987 with those in 1990 suggested a tendency toward an increase in the frequency of OFLX-resistant isolates with the passage of time of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella ssp., Enterobacter spp., Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Most common elevations of MIC values against these bacteria were observed in MIC80 and MIC90 values, while no significant alteration was observed in MIC50 values. However, MIC50's of OFLX against Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were relatively high for strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. Most of the OFLX-resistant strains of S. aureus seemed to be methicillin-resistant (MRSA). Furthermore, MIC80 of OFLX against coagulase-negative staphylococci was high in strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. 2. Susceptibility of Streptococcus spp. was evaluated only in strains isolated in 1990. The results were comparable to those reported by others in the early 1980s. 3. Bacteria which showed no or infrequent emergence of OFLX-resistant strains even in 1990 were Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Campylobacter spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. 4. Recently isolated strains from patients with community-acquired infections showed a tendency toward an increase of the frequency of OFLX-resistant strains among many bacteria. However, the bacteria which contained high percentages of OFLX-resistant strains except for MRSA were so-called less-virulent bacteria, and in the other bacteria elevations of MIC values were only observed in MIC80 and MIC90. These results suggested that OFLX preserved a potent antibacterial activity against bacteria which were major causative pathogens in community-acquired infections.
TI  - Cefpodoxime: comparative antibacterial activity, influence of growth conditions,  and bactericidal activity.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime, the active metabolite of the new cephalosporin ester cefpodoxime proxetil, in comparison to cefixime, cefotiam, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime was determined against a broad spectrum of freshly isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. Cefpodoxime was demonstrated to be inhibitory at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 90% of strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli (beta-lactamase- negative strains), Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia spp., and Salmonella spp. This antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was generally superior to that of cefuroxime and similar to that of cefixime. Cefpodoxime was active at less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 50% of the members of beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter spp., and Morganella morganii. Cefpodoxime proved to be highly inhibitory against group A, B, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 less than 0.015 mg/l). The MICs of cefpodoxime and those of the other cephalosporins were less than 2 mg/l for greater than or equal to 90% of the strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with the exception of cefixime which had no activity with MICs below 8 mg/l against these bacteria. Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., and Enterococcus spp. were resistant to cefpodoxime. The antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime was only to a minor degree influenced by different growth conditions with the exception of high inoculum sizes against some beta-lactamase producing strains of gram-negative bacilli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The e (P4) outer membrane protein of Haemophilus influenzae: biologic activity of anti-e serum and cloning and sequencing of the structural gene.
AB  - Outer membrane proteins of nontypeable (NT) Haemophilus influenzae are among the  major candidates for inclusion in vaccines against these organisms. This article reports the purification of the e (P4) lipoprotein of H. influenzae and the subsequent production of antiserum directed against this protein. The anti-e polyclonal serum cross-reacted with e protein in multiple clinical NT H. influenzae isolates. Monoclonal antibody analysis of e protein showed at least one surface-exposed epitope to be conserved among NT H. influenzae strains. Anti-e serum also had bactericidal activity against multiple clinical isolates of NT H. influenzae. These results are in contrast to previous reports in the literature that purified P4 protein did not elicit biologically active antibodies. Anti-e antibodies exhibited synergistic bactericidal activity directed against NT H. influenzae when mixed with antibodies directed against another Haemophilus lipoprotein, PCP. This bactericidal synergy was observed against a variety of NT clinical isolates. We also report the cloning of the Haemophilus e lipoprotein, or hel, gene encoding the e protein and its expression and processing in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequence of the gene and deduced amino acid sequence of the protein are given. These results demonstrate that e protein is a viable candidate to be a component of a vaccine against NT H. influenzae.
TI  - Identification of two genes, kpsM and kpsT, in region 3 of the polysialic acid gene cluster of Escherichia coli K1.
AB  - The polysialic acid capsule of Escherichia coli K1, a causative agent of neonatal septicemia and meningitis, is an essential virulence determinant. The 17-kb kps gene cluster, which is divided into three functionally distinct regions, encodes proteins necessary for polymer synthesis and expression at the cell surface. The central region, 2, encodes products required for synthesis, activation, and polymerization of sialic acid, while flanking regions, 1 and 3, are thought to be involved in polymer assembly and transport. In this study, we identified two genes in region 3, kpsM and kpsT, which encode proteins with predicted sizes of 29.6 and 24.9 kDa, respectively. The hydrophobicity profile of KpsM suggests that it is an integral membrane protein, while KpsT contains a consensus ATP-binding domain. KpsM and KpsT belong to a family of prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins involved with a variety of biological processes, including membrane transport. A previously described kpsT chromosomal mutant that accumulates intracellular polysialic acid was characterized and could be complemented in trans. Results of site-directed mutagenesis of the putative ATP-binding domain of KpsT are consistent with the view that KpsT is a nucleotide-binding protein. KpsM and KpsT have significant similarity to BexB and BexA, two proteins that are essential for polysaccharide capsule expression in Haemophilus influenzae type b. We propose that KpsM and KpsT constitute a system for transport of polysialic acid across the cytoplasmic membrane.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the internal medicine].
AB  - Fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. There were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9 with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with fever of unknown origin. Forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. The overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. The efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), other Gram-positive coccus (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Serratia marcescens (3), Escherichia coli (3), Branhamella catarrhalis (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Enterobacter sp. (1), and Peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. P. aeruginosa (3) and Acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. S. aureus (1), S. epidermidis (1), P. aeruginosa (5), and S. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. The eradication rate was 83.7%. Six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of S-GOT 2. But all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. These findings indicate that IPM/CS is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.
TI  - Sequence and transcriptional regulation of com101A, a locus required for genetic  transformation in Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - A 2.8-kb EcoRI-BglII fragment cloned from the wild-type Haemophilus influenzae Rd chromosome is shown to increase the transformability of the Com-101 mutant through trans complementation. Deletion and sequence analyses indicate that the active region of the clone carries a 687-bp open reading frame. A 0.3-kb insertion in the corresponding EcoRI-BglII fragment of the Com-101 chromosome is shown to be a partial (331-bp) duplication of this open reading frame. The wild-type sequence produces a peptide of a size that is consistent with the sequence data when this sequence is expressed in Escherichia coli with a T7 promoter-based transcription vector. RNA hybridization analysis using a DNA probe derived from the open reading frame suggests that the sequence is transiently expressed during competence development. On the basis of these observations, it is proposed that the open reading frame corresponds to the com101A gene.
TI  - Role of lipooligosaccharides in experimental dermal lesions caused by Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - The mouse and rabbit intradermal injection models have been used to define factors that may be important in Haemophilus ducreyi pathogenesis. We used H. ducreyi strains with diverse geographic origins and phenotypic characteristics to evaluate the experimental models. Injection of live and heat-killed bacteria caused skin abscesses in both models. Semiquantitative cultures of skin injected with live bacteria showed that H. ducreyi failed to replicate in animal tissue. These data suggested that the experimental lesions were caused by a heat-stable substance such as lipooligosaccharide (LOS). In mice, injection of H. ducreyi and Haemophilus influenzae LOS and Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide caused mild to moderate inflammation. In rabbits, injection of H. ducreyi LOS caused intradermal abscesses that were histologically similar to those caused by live and heat-killed bacteria. H. ducreyi and Neisseria gonorrhoeae LOS caused significantly larger lesions than equivalent amounts of H. influenzae LOS and E. coli lipopolysaccharide in the rabbit model. We conclude that the intradermal injection models are not valid models to study the growth of H. ducreyi in vivo. However, these data indicate that H. ducreyi LOS may play an important role in the pathogenesis of chancroid and that the rabbit model should be useful in studying H. ducreyi LOS toxicity at the cellular level.
TI  - Cloning, genetic analysis, and nucleotide sequence of a determinant coding for a  19-kilodalton peptidoglycan-associated protein (Ppl) of Legionella pneumophila.
AB  - A genomic library of Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires  disease in humans, was constructed in Escherichia coli K-12, and the recombinant clones were screened by immuno-colony blots with an antiserum raised against heat-killed L. pneumophila. Twenty-three clones coding for a Legionella-specific protein of 19 kDa were isolated. The 19-kDa protein, which represents an outer membrane protein, was found to be associated with the peptidoglycan layer both in L. pneumophila and in the recombinant E. coli clones. This was shown by electrophoresis and Western immunoblot analysis of bacterial cell membrane fractions with a monospecific polyclonal 19-kDa protein-specific antiserum. The protein was termed peptidoglycan-associated protein of L. pneumophila (Ppl). The corresponding genetic determinant, ppl, was subcloned on a 1.8-kb ClaI fragment. DNA sequence studies revealed that two open reading frames, pplA and pplB, coding for putative proteins of 18.9 and 16.8 kDa, respectively, were located on the ClaI fragment. Exonuclease III digestion studies confirmed that pplA is the gene coding for the peptidoglycan-associated 19-kDa protein of L. pneumophila. The amino acid sequence of PplA exhibits a high degree of homology to the sequences of the Pal lipoproteins of E. coli K-12 and Haemophilus influenzae.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of amoxicillin alone and in combination with clavulanic  acid correlated with beta-lactamase production.
AB  - Amoxicillin, a beta-lactam antibiotic, was tested for its effect in combination with clavulanic acid, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, against 9 species of bacteria isolated from clinical specimens. A total of 698 strains of bacteria were tested for beta-lactamase production by the rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method. Their susceptibilities to amoxicillin alone and in combination with clavulanic acid were tested by the agar dilution method. The percentage of beta-lactamase producing strains ranged from 46.6% in Proteus mirabilis to 100% in Klebsiella pneumoniac. In general, beta-lactamase nonproducers were more susceptible to amoxicillin than beta-lactamase producers. For beta-lactamase producers, clavulanic acid decreased the MICs of amoxicillin prominently in strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae and Bacteroides fragilis, when combining clavulanic acid with amoxicillin in the ratio of 1:2. Their MIC50s, MIC90s and geometric means of MICs all decreased 4 folds or greater. For beta-lactamase non-producing strains, the MICs did not show significant differences by adding clavulanic acid in most species we tested, including methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, N. gonorrhoeae, H. influenzae, Proteus vulgaris and E. cloacae.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ceftibuten, a new oral third generation cephalosporin.
AB  - Ceftibuten, a new oral third generation cephalosporin, was found to be the most active beta-lactam drug tested against members of the Enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting most strains at less than 4 micrograms/ml. All isolates of Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria spp. were highly susceptible to ceftibuten. Penicillin-sensitive pneumococci and pathogenic beta-hemolitic streptococci were also killed by ceftibuten. The antibacterial activity of this new drug, which results in rapid lysis of susceptible cells, was not significantly affected by serum, pH, inoculum size, media composition and growth conditions. Ceftibuten is characterized by a remarkable resistance to inactivation by most beta-lactamases synthetized by common gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. The potent in vitro activity of ceftibuten in conjunction with its favorable pharmacokinetic profile render this new molecule an attractive candidate for the treatment of respiratory and urinary tract infections sustained by susceptible pathogens.
TI  - Characterization of a Legionella pneumophila gene encoding a lipoprotein antigen.
AB  - A prominent 19 kDa surface antigen of Legionella pneumophila, cloned in Escherichia coli, was found to be intimately associated with peptidoglycan. The DNA region encoding this antigen was mapped on an 11.9 kb plasmid by means of deletion analysis and transposon mutagenesis. PhoA+ gene fusions, gene-rated by TnphoA insertions into this region, confirmed the presence of a gene encoding a secreted protein. PhoA+ transposon insertions were also associated with loss of the 19 kDa antigen in immunoassays using a monoclonal antibody (mAb1E9) and the replacement of the 19 kDa antigen with larger fusion proteins in immunoblots using Legionella immune serum. A 1540bp PstI fragment carrying the gene was sequenced, and the open reading frame encoding the antigen was identified. The gene encodes a polypeptide 176 amino acid residues long and 18913Da in size. The presence of a signal sequence of 22 amino acids with a consensus sequence for cleavage by signal peptidase II indicates that the antigen is a lipoprotein, and striking similarity with peptidoglycan-associated lipoproteins (PALs) from E. coli (51% amino acid homology) and Haemophilus influenzae (55% homology) is noted. We conclude that the 19kDa antigen of L. pneumophila is the structural equivalent of the PAL found in other Gram-negative species and suggest that its post-translational acylation may explain its potency as an immunogen.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefcanel versus other oral cephalosporins.
AB  - Cefcanel is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. Its activity was compared with that of cefuroxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, and cefixime against gram-positive and negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Cefcanel had excellent activity against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, MIC90 1 micrograms/ml, superior to the other oral cephalosporins. However, methicillin-resistant staphylococci were resistant, MIC greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.015-1 micrograms/ml, concentrations comparable to other cephalosporins. Clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.25 micrograms/ml, 8- to 128-fold lower concentrations than were found for other agents, but the MICs were greater than 64 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides spp. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 1 micrograms/ml, similar to cefuroxime but 16-fold greater than the MICs of cefixime. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia which were high beta-lactamase producers were resistant, MICs greater than 64 micrograms/ml, and 50% of Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii were resistant. Cefcanel was hydrolyzed by TEM-1, TEM-3 and Moraxella Bro-1 beta-lactamases. Escherichia coli containing TEM-1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 had cefcanel MICs of greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Although cefcanel inhibited gram-positive species as well as or at lower concentrations than other cephalosporins, it lacked activity against gram-negative species that produced common plasmid beta-lactamase although it inhibited Haemophilus influenzae carrying TEM-1.
TI  - Sequence of a PAL-related lipoprotein from Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - The sequence of a small Bacillus subtilis lipoprotein is reported. The gene encodes a protein of 124 amino acids, which shows a low but statistically significant homology to the peptidoglycan-associated lipoproteins (PAL) of Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae. Although the functions of these proteins have not been confirmed, they are obviously structural proteins. In E. coli the gene for the peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein appears to be essential.
TI  - [Role of cefuroxime-axetil in the treatment of respiratory tract infections. Bacteriological and pharmacological data].
AB  - Cefuroxime-axetil, the 1-acetoxyethyl ester of cefuroxime, is a prodrug for oral  administration. The indication of this new formulation in the treatment of community acquired RTI required an updating of its activity against respiratory pathogens. A total of 260 isolates were included in a study using MIC determination (agar dilution technique): the mode MICs for Haemophilus spp., Branhamella catarrhalis, streptococci, S. pneumoniae ranged from 0.016 to 0.5 mg/l; no difference was noted between beta-lactamase producers and non producers in Haemophilus and B. catarrhalis; coagulase positive staphylococci, E. coli, K. pneumoniae isolated from RTI exhibited mode MICs not exceeding 4 mg/l (except for methicillin-R staphylococci mode MIC greater than 128 mg/l). Simultaneously the pharmacokinetic parameters were determined in healthy volunteers after a loading dose (500 mg) of the drug: 7 consecutive samples collected after a light meal provided the following data: Cmax = 7.77 +/- 2.2 mg/l; Tmax = 2.33 +/- 0.23 hrs; t1/2 beta = 1.18 +/- 0.19 hrs; AUC = 22.17 +/- 6.4 h.mg/l. Cmax and AUC were half of these values after administration of 250 mg. These results, together with the known intrinsic beta-lactamase stability of cefuroxime, should ensure sufficient in vivo concentrations and effective in vivo antibacterial activity against most respiratory pathogens after oral administration of cefuroxime-axetil.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefpodoxime against bacterial isolates obtained from patients with cancer.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefpodoxime, an oral cephalosporin ester, against 792 bacterial isolates representing 36 species was evaluated in comparison to that of ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). Cefpodoxime inhibited the majority of Streptococcus spp., Haemophilus influenzae and Proteus mirabilis at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml. It was also active against Citrobacter diversus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus isolates. Overall, cefpodoxime appeared to be less active than ciprofloxacin and TMP/SMX against many pathogens common in cancer patients.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on cefpirome in pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpirome (HR 810, CPR), a new cephem antibiotic, was investigated for its experimental and clinical studies in pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Plasma and urinary levels of CPR were determined in 2 children (age 5 and 7 years) after the one shot intravenous injection of the drug at 20 mg/kg. Average plasma levels of the drug were 44.7 micrograms/ml, 28.5 micrograms/ml, 10.5 micrograms/ml, 4.6 micrograms/ml and 1.5 micrograms/ml at 1/2 hour, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours and 6 hours, respectively, and the average half life was 1.57 hours. Average urinary levels of the drug were 1,785 micrograms/ml, 545 micrograms/ml and 198 micrograms/ml at 0-2 hours, 2-4 hours, 4-6 hours, respectively and the average urinary elimination rate was 52.0%. The results were nearly equivalent to those in adults except for urinary elimination rate which tended to be slightly lower than that in adults. 2. Cerebrospinal fluid levels in 3 cases of purulent meningitis treated with CPR were investigated. Cerebrospinal fluid levels in a case of Neisseria meningitidis were 11.5-23.1 micrograms/ml at 1 hour and 0.94 microgram/ml at 5 hours after intravenous injection of 44.4 mg/kg, 4 times a day. Cerebrospinal fluid levels in a case of Streptococcus pneumoniae were 1.01-4.23 micrograms/ml at 1 hour after intravenous injection of 49.0 mg/kg, 6 times a day, and in the other case with Streptococcus pneumoniae, the levels were 16.8-37.1 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, 11.3 and 3.60 micrograms/ml at 3 and 4 hours after intravenous injection 52.2 mg/kg, 6 times a day. These results are not inferior to those with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. These levels appear to be higher than MIC90 values against Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae which are the major pathogens of these diseases. 3. CPR was given to 62 patients and clinical efficacy, bacteriological response and adverse reactions were evaluated. Evaluated cases for clinical efficacy included 3 cases of purulent meningitis, 1 case of acute purulent otitis media, 2 cases of acute purulent tonsillitis, 1 case of acute bronchitis, 49 cases of acute pneumoniae, 1 case of scarlet fever, 1 case of acute osteomyelitis, 1 case of acute enterocolitis, and 2 cases of acute UTI, totalling 61 cases. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 38 cases, good in 22 cases and fair in 1 case with an efficacy rete of 98.4% (excellent + good).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Incidence and prognostic significance of positive blood cultures in neonatal and pediatric intensive care].
AB  - The incidence and prognostic importance of positive blood cultures were evaluated over a two-year period (1986/87) in 1371 admissions to a multi-disciplinary neonatal and pediatric intensive care unit (ICU). Blood cultures were performed in 439 patients of which 80 cultures were positive. Septicemia was confirmed in 70 cases, the 10 remaining cases being classified as contamination or bacteremia. The incidence of nosocomial, ICU-acquired septicemia was low (7/70). The major causative organisms of sepsis were those commonly encountered in neonatal and pediatric infections, including Haemophilus influenzae (37), Escherichia coli (11, Neisseria meningitidis (9) and group B streptococci (3). Typically nosocomial organisms were rare. In the group of 70 septicemic cases, multiple organ system failure was diagnosed in 23 patients. Nine died, most often due to irreversible septic shock (13% mortality). In order to avoid a selection bias, all admissions were examined for the presence of sepsis syndrome (clinical signs of sepsis with negative blood cultures). Out of 21 such patients, three died. The results suggest that in comparison to intensive care in adults the following conclusions may be drawn: (1) sepsis with positive blood cultures plays a minor role at our unit; (2) the rate of ICU-acquired septicemia is low (10% of all cases of sepsis with positive blood culture); and (3) the prognostic bearing of a positive blood culture in patients with septic signs is not too unfavourable (87% survival rate).
TI  - Enzymatically deacylated Neisseria lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inhibits murine splenocyte mitogenesis induced by LPS.
AB  - Acyloxyacyl hydrolase is a leukocyte enzyme that selectively removes the secondary acyl chains from the lipid A moiety of gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). As predicted by the reported contribution of secondary acyl chains to the bioactivities of lipid A analogs, enzymatic deacylation of Salmonella typhimurium Rc LPS substantially reduces its potency in the dermal Shwartzman reaction and in several in vitro assays that measure responses of human endothelial cells and neutrophils, whereas the potency of this LPS for inducing murine splenocyte mitogenesis is affected much less. In the experiments described here, we studied the impact of acyloxyacyl hydrolysis on the bioactivities of several LPS that differ from Salmonella LPS in carbohydrate and lipid A structures. Deacylated LPS from Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, and S. typhimurium were similarly reduced in potency in the Limulus lysate test (30- to 60-fold reduction in potency relative to the corresponding mock-treated LPS), and the ability of all of these deacylated LPS to stimulate neutrophil adherence to human endothelial cells was reduced by a factor of 100 or more. For LPS from E. coli, H. influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the impact of deacylation on spleen cell mitogenesis was also similar to that observed for S. typhimurium LPS: deacylation reduced potency by less than 15-fold. Unexpectedly, the potency of Neisseria LPS in the murine splenocyte mitogenicity test was reduced over 100-fold by deacylation, and deacylated Neisseria LPS could block the mitogenic activity of Neisseria and Salmonella LPS. These studies indicate that the contribution of secondary acyl chains to the bioactivities of a given LPS cannot be predicted with confidence from the reported structure-activity relationships of lipid A or from the behavior of other deacylated LPS.

TI  - Infantile meningitis in England and Wales: a two year study.
AB  - A two year prospective study identified 1922 cases of meningitis in children under 1 year of age. A further 201 cases were identified from other sources. The annual incidence of meningitis during the first year of life was 1.6/1000; during the first 28 days of life it was 0.32/1000, and among postneonatal infants it was 1.22/1000. The male:female ratio was 1.4:1. The overall case fatality rate was 19.8% for neonates and 5.4% for postneonatal infants. Two thirds of deaths identified in the study, 50% of all deaths, were not attributed to meningitis by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys. Group B beta haemolytic streptococci (28%), Escherichia coli (18%), and Listeria monocytogenes (5%) were most frequently isolated from neonates and Neisseria meningitidis (31%), Haemophilus influenzae (30%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (10%) from postneonatal infants. At 2-6 months of age N meningitidis meningitis was most common, and at 7-12 months H influenzae predominated. Meningitis caused by group B beta haemolytic streptococci occurred up to 6 months of age and had a consistent mortality of 25%. Neonatal meningitis due to Gram negative enteric rods had a mortality of 32%. Low birth weight was a significant predisposing factor for both neonates and postneonatal infants. In both groups mortality was significantly higher among children admitted in coma. There was no seasonal variation in incidence in either group. Neonates were treated with either group. Neonates were treated with either chloramphenicol (50%) or gentamicin (48%) usually in combination with a penicillin; 40% received a third generation cephalosporin. Of the 1472 postneonatal infants treated 84% received chloramphenicol with a penicillin and 10% received a third generation cephalosporin. Relapse occurred in 49 patients and three died. Eighteen babies coned as a result of raised intracranial pressure, including four neonates, and four died. Mortality among the 133 (7%) children who received steroids was significantly higher than in the rest of the study group.
TI  - Molecular analysis of a complex locus from Haemophilus influenzae involved in phase-variable lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis.
AB  - A chromosomal locus, lic3, one of several involved in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis by Haemophilus influenzae, was cloned and its DNA sequence determined. lic3 comprises four closely apposed open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 includes tandem repeats of the tetramer CAAT and two start codons out of frame with each other are found upstream of the repeats. ORF1 encodes a protein with no known homologues. ORF2 encodes the UDP-galactose-4-epimerase (galE) gene. ORF3 encodes a hydrophobic protein with no known homologues. ORF4 encodes the adenylate kinase (adk) gene. A deletion/insertion mutation lacking the 3' end of ORF1, all of galE, and the 5' end of ORF3 was constructed in the parent Hib strain (RM7004). These mutants had a galE phenotype, as evidenced by galactose sensitivity, altered LPS when grown in the absence of exogenous galactose, and reduced virulence in infant rats.
TI  - New shuttle vectors for Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli: P15A-derived plasmids replicate in H. influenzae Rd.
AB  - With the aim of identifying new plasmids useful for molecular cloning in Haemophilus influenzae, several P15A-derived plasmids were tested for their ability to transform H. influenzae Rd. The four plasmids tested, pACYC177, pACYC184, pSU2718, and pSU2719 were all able to establish in H. influenzae Rd. The plasmids were stable, could be purified by standard protocols, and were compatible with a plasmid carrying the RSF0885 origin of replication.
TI  - [Combined antibacterial activity of aztreonam and clindamycin against clinically  isolated strains].
AB  - It has been reported in some studies that the combination of aztreonam (AZT) and  clindamycin (CLDM) have high clinical effectiveness in the treatment of intractable infections. We, therefore, studied combined in vitro antibacterial activity of these 2 compounds using many freshly isolated strains. 1. AZT and CLDM in combination had synergistic effects on Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae, which are sensitive or quasi-sensitive to CLDM, in the presence of CLDM at MIC or sub-MIC. 2. For Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are not sensitive to CLDM, the 2 drugs in combination showed synergistic effects on some species and additive or slightly additive effects on most species in the presence of CLDM at those concentrations which are usually maintained in blood. 3. The 2 drugs showed no antagonism.
TI  - Differentiation of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacteroides and Haemophilus species in gram-stained direct smears.
AB  - The accuracy of examination of the Gram-stained direct smear to classify presumptively Gram-negative rods into three morphotype groups, that is, (a) Enteric bacteria, (b) Pseudomonas, and (c) Bacteroides or Haemophilus, was evaluated. Randomly selected clinical strains (4-9) each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Ps. aeruginosa, B. fragilis, and H. influenzae were used to produce peritonitis or subcutaneous abscesses in mice. A Gram-stained direct smear was prepared from exudate collected from each animal. The direct smears were examined to classify bacteria observed into one of the three morphotype groups. The percent accuracy was 82, 56, and 95, respectively, and 76 overall. The assumption was made that classification was based primarily on differences in length and width of the organisms. To test this hypothesis, we prepared scanning electron photomicrographs from each specimen of exudate and measured the lengths and widths of bacteria. Examination of the Gram-stained direct smear was more accurate for classification of enteric bacteria, H. influenzae, or B. fragilis. Electron microscopy was more accurate for classification of Ps. aeruginosa. The higher length-width radio should be helpful in recognizing Ps. aeruginosa in direct smears.
TI  - Evidence for a common molecular origin of the capsule gene loci in gram-negative  bacteria expressing group II capsular polysaccharides.
AB  - Capsular polysaccharides of Gram-negative bacteria contribute to a large extent to the pathogenicity of these organisms. We show here that the molecular organization of the capsule gene loci in different serogroups of Neisseria meningitidis is similar to that of Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli. A common molecular origin of the mechanisms of encapsulation is indicated by strong homology of the genes involved in transport of the capsular polysaccharides to the cell surface in all these organisms. The proteins involved in capsular polysaccharide transport fit the characteristics of ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters. Furthermore, by sequence comparison of the sialytransferases of N. meningitidis B and E. coli K1, the capsule of which is composed of alpha 2,8-linked polyneuraminic acid, a significant degree of homology was observed, indicating that the capsular polysaccharide type itself has the same evolutionary origin in these two pathogens.
TI  - Pelvic inflammatory disease: guidelines for prevention and management.
AB  - This report provides comprehensive guidelines to aid practitioners and decision makers in achieving PID prevention and management objectives. The main focus of this document is PID related to STD. These guidelines for the prevention and management of PID were established by staff of CDC in consultation with a group of outside experts. Current data regarding the efficacy of prevention strategies and management approaches form the basis for the guidelines. Because data are incomplete, however, certain aspects of these guidelines represent the current consensus judgment of the consulted experts. Recommendations in this document should be considered a source of guidance to health practitioners.
TI  - [Neonatal conjunctivitis in a nursery and a neonatal unit].
AB  - After Crede prophylaxis was abandoned at our hospital in 1984 scrupulous clinical surveillance of all neonates for conjunctivitis, and bacterial cultures from purulent eye discharge, have become routine. During the two-year period 1 March 1987 to 28 February 1989, testing for Chlamydia trachomatis (EIA-technique) was added in all infants with clinical conjunctivitis. During the period concerned there were 332 cases of conjunctivitis among 4,520 live born infants, an incidence of 7.3%. The incidence was higher for infants staying in the nursery (8.2%) than for those admitted to the neonatal unit (3.5%) (p less than 0.01). 90% of the infections were diagnosed during the first week of life. 468 isolates were identified by routine bacteriological investigation, 452 gram-positives (96.6%), and 16 gram-negatives (3.4%). The following strains were found: Staphylococcus aureus 171 (51.5% of the patients), Staphylococcus epidermidis 153 (46.1%), Streptococcus viridans 106 (31.9%), diphteroids 11 (3.3%), beta-hemolytic streptococci seven (2.1%), Streptococcus pneumoniae two (0.6%), enterococci two (0.6%), Hemophilus influenzae six (1.8%), Escherichia coli five (1.5%), Proteus two (0.6%) and Branhamella catarrhalis one (0.3%). Not a single case of gonococcal ophthalmia was diagnosed. Positive tests for Chlamydia were found in 13 infants (3.9% of all infants with conjunctivitis), an incidence of 0.3% for the whole population of live born infants. Six of the chlamydia infections (46%) occurred within the first week of life. Expenses for chlamydia testing were estimated to be NOK 1,020 per positive test. Preventing conjunctivitis in our nursery and neonatal unit calls for strategies to protect newborn infants from colonization with pathogenic bacteria, especially S. aureus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro and in vivo evaluation of Ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with high antipseudomonal activity.
AB  - Ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with a catechol moiety attached at position 7 of the cephalosporin ring, showed high in vitro activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Streptococcus pyogenes, with MICs for 90% of strains tested (MIC90s) of less than or equal to 0.39 micrograms/ml. Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Citrobacter freundii, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited with MIC90s of less than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml. Serratia marcescens was less susceptible to Ro 09-1428, with a MIC90 of 25 micrograms/ml. The most distinctive feature of Ro 09-1428 was its potent activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, with MIC90s of 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Most of the ceftazidime-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, and C. freundii were inhibited by Ro 09-1428, while those of S. marcescens were resistant at a concentration of 12.5 micrograms/ml. Ro 09-1428 was more active than ceftazidime against staphylococci. PBP 3 was the most sensitive target in E. coli and P. aeruginosa. The response to ferric iron in growth medium suggests that Ro 09-1428 may be taken up by transport mechanisms similar to those of other catechol cephalosporins. In accordance with its in vitro activity, Ro 09-1428 activity was equal to or greater than ceftazidime activity in efficacy against experimental septicemias in mice. The results indicate that Ro 09-1428 is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with advantages over ceftazidime in its activity against P. aeruginosa, staphylococci, and ceftazidime-resistant strains of C. freundii and E. cloacae.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefpirome in pediatrics and a study on the penetration into cerebrospinal fluid].
AB  - Cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new cephem antibiotic, was investigated for its penetration into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and its clinical efficacy against bacterial infections. 1. CSF concentrations of CPR following intravenous injection was investigated in 2 patients with purulent meningitis. In one of them, the concentrations were 2.11 micrograms/ml and 1.31 micrograms/ml on 3 and 8 days, respectively, after start of administration. In the other patient, they were 24.2 micrograms/ml, and 1.35 micrograms/ml on 2 days and 7 days after administration, respectively. 2. Antibacterial activities of CPR against clinical isolates, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, except those against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were clearly superior to those of ceftazidime. 3. Clinical efficacies evaluated in 15 patients were "excellent" in 9, "good" in 5 and "unknown" in 1. The overall efficacy rate was 93.0%. 4. Clinical efficacies were "excellent" in 1 patient with bacteremia, "excellent" in 6 and "good" in one of 7 patients with pneumonia, and "good" in both of the 2 patients with purulent meningitis. Clinical efficacies against other diseases were "excellent" or "good", in 1 patient with pyothorax, 1 patient with purulent lymphadenitis, and 2 patients with facial cellulitis. In 1 patient with biliary tract infection, the results of treatment with CPR were "unknown" due to insufficient clinical data. 5. No adverse reactions were observed except in 1 patient who showed an increase in platelet count.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefpirome in the field  of pediatrics].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized below. 1. Antibacterial activities of CPR against clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae were superior to those of ceftazidime. 2. Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of CPR at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 2 cases each were determined. Mean peak plasma concentrations of CPR at these dose levels were 33.9, 62.9 and 96.0 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes with plasma half-lives of 1.58, 1.69, and 2.13 hours, respectively. Mean cumulative urinary excretion rates in the first 8 hours after administration were 51.2, 78.0 and 74.9%, respectively. 3. Ten patients with bacterial infections (pneumonia 5 cases, urinary tract infection 5 cases) were treated with CPR at a daily dose of 16-79 mg/kg/day. The overall clinical efficacy and bacteriological eradication rates were both 100%. 4. No adverse reactions were observed except in 1 case of mild pain in blood vessels. Abnormal laboratory test results were also mild, slight elevation of GOT, GPT and thrombocytosis in 1 case and eosinophilia in 1 case.
TI  - [Bacteriological and clinical studies of cefodizime in pediatrics].
AB  - Bacteriological and clinical studies on cefodizime (CDZM, THR-221), a new cephem  developed by Hoechst AG and Roussel Uclaf, were carried out and the results are summarized below: 1. Against Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae, antibacterial activities of CDZM were similar to those of cefotaxime (CTX), cefazolin, cefotiam and piperacillin. Against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia sp., antibacterial activities of CDZM were similar to that of CTX, and superior to those of other tested antibiotics. Especially against Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis, it showed an excellent antibacterial activity. 2. Although the clinical efficacy was poor in 1 patient with sepsis caused by Salmonella marcescens and in another with cervical lymphadenitis, in 5 patients with upper respiratory tract infection, 4 patients with bronchitis, 6 patients with bronchopneumonia, 18 patients with pneumonia, 5 patients with urinary tract infection and 1 patient with enteritis, the clinical efficacy was excellent or good and the efficacy rate was 95.1% (39/41) including excellent efficacies in 25 cases. 3. Bacteriologically, all identified causative bacteria were eradicated except for 1 case of Salmonella sp., thus the eradication rate was 97.4% (38/39). Especially S. pneumoniae in 10 cases, H. influenzae in 12 cases and B. catarrhalis in 3 cases were eradicated totally. 4. Adverse reactions were studied in 46 cases, and digestive symptoms were observed in 9 cases (diarrhea 5 cases, loose stools 4 cases). Eruption and vascular pain were observed in 1 case each. As digestive symptoms in 9 cases were mild, the treatment were not suspended. In laboratory test values, elevation of GOT, elevation of GPT, elevation of bilirubin, and eosinophilia were observed in 1 case each. Influences on blood coagulation parameters were studied. No change was observed between the beginning and the end of the treatment. From above results, we have concluded that CDZM is a useful and safe antibiotic in pediatrics, administered at a daily dose of 20 mg/kg divided into 3 or 4 doses and administered intravenously.
TI  - Molecular cloning, partial purification, and characterization of a haemin-binding lipoprotein from Haemophilus influenzae type b.
AB  - A library of genomic DNA fragments from Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) DL42  was constructed in plasmid pBR322, transformed into Escherichia coli strain RR1, and screened for recombinant clones with haemin-binding activity by plating onto haemin-containing agar. Expression of haemin-binding activity by clones correlated with the expression of a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 51,000 (51K) that was also recognized by anti-Hib strain DL42 serum in immunoblots. One recombinant clone, designated pHM2, with the smallest DNA insert (3.62 kb) was characterized further. Ethanol inhibition of expression of pHM2 in minicells revealed that the 51K protein was the result of a processing event involving a larger precursor. E. coli RR1(pHM2) adsorbed haemin in liquid suspensions as well as from solid media. Subcloning of a 2.6 kb fragment of pHM2 into a shuttle vector permitted the construction of a recombinant Hib clone, DL42(pHM1002), which overexpressed the 51K haemin-binding protein. This 51K protein appears to be peripherally associated with the inner, and possibly outer, membranes of Hib. Affinity chromatography on haemin-agarose was utilized to purify the haemin-binding protein from both E. coli RR1(pHM2) and Hib DL42(pHM1002) to near homogeneity. The use of the antibiotic globomycin in a minicell expression system and radioimmunoprecipitation analysis of Hib proteins intrinsically radiolabelled with [3H]-palmitate indicated that the 51K haemin-binding protein is a lipoprotein.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetical and clinical study of cefpirome in children].
AB  - This study describes the pharmacokinetic characteristics and clinical usefulness  of cefpirome (CPR) in children. Mean half-lives of 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg of CPR injected intravenously in one shot were 1.18 and 1.34 hours, respectively, and their mean recovery rates into urine were 69.8 and 72.2%, respectively. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of CPR against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae were the same as or lower than those of ceftazidime. CPR was clinically effective in 14/15 of patients with bacterial infections; 8/9 of pneumonia, 2/2 of bronchitis, 1/1 of pharyngitis, 1/1 of tonsillitis, 1/1 of osteomyelitis, 1/1 of urinary tract infection. No clinically overt side effects of CPR were found, while an increase of eosinophils in blood was observed in 2 cases, and an increase of platelet in blood in 1 case and an elevation of serum GPT activity in 1 case were also observed. These findings indicate that CPR is useful for the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome in pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic, was studied for its pharmacokinetics, bacteriological and clinical effects in the field of pediatrics. 1. CPR was very active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae among Gram-positive cocci. Antibacterial activities of CPR were also strong against Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa among Gram-negative rods. 2. The plasma concentration 15 minutes after a bolus intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg was 80.4 micrograms/ml, and the T 1/2 (beta) was 1.03 hours. Plasma concentrations after intravenous drip infusion over 30 minutes of 20 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg were 48.3 and 117 micrograms/ml at the end of infusion, and T 1/2 (beta) for these dosage were 1.14 and 1.45 hours. 3. The urinary recovery rates over 6 hours after administration were 45.2-63.9% for CPR. 4. Clinical efficacies of CPR were excellent in 31 patients and good in 30 patients with an efficacy rate of 98.4%. In bacteriological examinations, causative organisms were eradicated with an eradication rate of 95.7%. 5. As side effects, diarrhea was observed in 5 patients and loose stool in 1 patient with an incidence of 8.2%. Abnormal values were found in some patients in clinical laboratory tests for eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and an elevation of GOT, GPT and triglyceride. These findings indicate that CPR will be useful against bacterial infections in pediatrics.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of GR69153, a new long-acting cephalosporin.
AB  - GR69153, a new parenteral cephalosporin, inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, shigellae, and salmonellae at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml (MIC90). It had activity comparable to those of ceftazidime, cefpirome, cefepime, and E-1040. Against cephalosporinase-producing Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens, MICs ranged from 0.12 to greater than 32 micrograms/ml, and cefpirome and cefepime were the most active agents against these species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly susceptible to GR69153, and for this organism the MIC90 was less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, which was similar to the E-1040 MIC90, but most Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia isolates were resistant. GR69153 inhibited Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella branhamella at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. For Staphylococcus aureus GR69153 MICs were similar to those of ceftazidime and E-1040. Enterococci and listeriae were resistant to GR69153, but Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml. The activity of GR69153 was not affected by serum. GR69153 was not inactivated by the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, and BRO-1, but it was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-9, and morganellae. GR69153 had overall activity comparable to those of commercially available parenteral cephalosporins or those found in clinical investigations. It is more active against bacteroides than most available aminothiazolyl parenteral cephalosporins are. GR69153 is hydrolyzed by the new plasmid beta-lactamases, and thus, its primary value may be related to its pharmacological properties.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics and antibacterial efficacy of cefpirome (HR 810) in experimental Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis.
AB  - Cefpirome (HR 810) is a new cephalosporin related to cefotaxime that has potent bactericidal activity against a broad spectrum of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. The pharmacokinetics and bacteriological efficacy of cefpirome administered as a single intravenous dose were assessed in rabbits with experimental Haemophilus influenzae type b and Escherichia coli K1 meningitis. The mean penetrations into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in relation to the amount of drug in serum of animals infected with H. influenzae and E. coli were 25 and 54%, respectively. The median CSF bactericidal titers were 1:128 against both organisms at 1 h of uninfected animals, the mean penetration was 4.5%. There was a significant reduction in the concentrations of bacteria in CSFs of both groups of animals treated with cefpirome compared with that in untreated groups. Mortality was also significantly lower in treated animals than it was in untreated animals. Intravenous administration of dexamethasone before the cefpirome dose did not compromise penetration, bactericidal titers, or antibacterial activity of cefpirome in CSF.
TI  - Contribution of a 28-kilodalton membrane protein to the virulence of Haemophilus  influenzae.
AB  - A Haemophilus influenzae b (Hib) membrane protein with a molecular mass of 28 kDa bound polyclonal antisera raised against a highly purified Hib fimbrial subunit. We cloned the gene encoding this protein and found that the gene was expressed in Escherichia coli. DNA sequence analysis identified an 843-bp open reading frame which predicted a 26.78-kDa protein with an amino-terminal signal sequence and a mature protein with 70% similarity to the 28-kDa lipoprotein of E. coli (F. Yu, S. Inouye, and M. Inouye, J. Biol. Chem. 261:2284, 1986). Colony blot hybridization analysis with an intergenic probe of the cloned gene demonstrated that 29 of 32 H. influenzae strains hybridize with this gene. Insertion of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene into the open reading frame inactivated expression of the 28-kDa protein in E. coli. Isogenic Hib strains were derived by marker exchange mutagenesis to generate mutants which no longer expressed the 28-kDa protein as recognized with Western immunoblot analysis. There was no difference in the rate of nasopharyngeal colonization of infant rats or monkeys by the isogenic mutants which lacked the 28-kDa protein compared with colonization by the wild-type strain. In contrast, the frequency of invasion and density of bacteremia in infant rats caused by the isogenic mutants were reduced relative to those caused by the wild-type Hib strain. We conclude that this 28-kDa outer membrane protein aids transepithelial invasion of type b strains but is not essential.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefpirome in pediatric field].
AB  - We conducted a study on the pharmacokinetics and clinical application of cefpirome (CPR) in children. 1. A single intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg of CPR was given to a two-month-old boy, and the concentration of the drug in the blood was measured. Fifteen minutes after administration, the concentration was 53.3 micrograms/ml, and it gradually decreased thereafter, reaching a level of 5.18 micrograms/ml after 8 hours with a half-life in the plasma of 2.36 hours. 2. A single intravenous injection of 700 mg (50 mg/kg) of CPR and that of cefotaxime (CTX) were given to a girl with suppurative meningitis (3 years old, 14 kg, causative bacteria, Haemophilus influenzae), and concentrations of the drugs in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid after 1 hour were measured. On the second day of illness, the concentration of CTX in the plasma was 39.4 micrograms/ml and the concentration of desacetyl-CTX (D-CTX) was 25.2 micrograms/ml, while concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid were 6.22 micrograms/ml (15.8%) for CTX and 3.94 micrograms/ml (15.6%) for D-CTX. On the third day of illness, concentration of CPR in the plasma was 59.3 micrograms/ml, while its concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid was 7.44 micrograms/ml (12.5%). 3. CPR was intravenously administered in daily dosages of 37.7-75.0 mg/kg in 2-3 portions for periods of 4-15 days to 2 patients with septicemia (causative bacteria, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 1 case and Escherichia coli in the other), 1 patient with bronchitis (K. pneumoniae), 9 patients with pneumonia (1 case of Staphylococcus aureus, 3 cases of H. influenzae, 2 cases of Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 1 case of K. pneumoniae + Pseudomonas cepacia, 2 cases of H. influenzae + Branhamella catarrhalis), 2 patients with cellulitis (1 case of S. aureus, 1 case, causative agent unknown), 1 patient with suppurative lymphadenitis (causative agent, unknown), 1 patient with staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, 1 patient with renal abscess (causative agent, unknown), and 1 patient with a urinary tract infection (E. coli), for a total of 18 patients, with excellent results in 9 cases and good results in 9 cases, hence an efficacy rate of 100% was obtained. 4. As an accompanying side-effect, eruption was observed in 1 of the 18 patients, but when administration was discontinued, the symptom gradually receded, and it disappeared by the 4th day.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro studies with Bay V 3522, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activities of Bay v 3522, cefaclor, cephalexin, cefuroxime, cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate (2:1) and reference penicillins were compared against 314 clinical isolates of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and nine strains of Escherichia coli that differed in their outer membrane proteins in agar dilution tests with an inoculum of 10(4) cfu/spot. The beta-lactamase stabilities of the cephalosporins were also evaluated by spectrophotometric assay using 21 different beta-lactamases. Bay v 3522 was the most potent cephalosporin overall against Gram-positive pathogens, but slightly less active than amoxicillin/clavulanate. In addition to being highly active against streptococci (MIC90 = 0.25 micrograms/ml) and methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC90 = 1.0 micrograms/ml), Bay v 3522 was markedly more active than the other cephalosporins against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 = 4 micrograms/ml). Bay v 3522 was less potent against Gram-negative pathogens, especially nosocomial isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC90 greater than 64 micrograms/ml), but was active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, and beta-lactamase-negative Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC90 = 1.0 micrograms/ml0. Hydrolysis of Bay v 3522 by most beta-lactamases examined was significantly less than that observed for cephalothin and cefaclor; similar to that observed with cephalexin; and less than that observed with cefixime and cefuroxime. None of the beta-lactamases examined hydrolysed Bay v 3522 at a rate greater than 20 nmol/min/mg. The in vitro potency of Bay v 3522 against Gram-positive and fastidious Gram-negative pathogens and its resistance to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases produced by them support further investigation of this cephalosporin as a new oral therapeutic agent.
TI  - Open randomized controlled parallel study of ofloxacin versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment of lower respiratory tract and urinary infections.
AB  - A total of 60 patients with lower respiratory tract or urinary tract infections were enrolled in an open, randomized, controlled, parallel study comparing 300 mg ofloxacin (OFX) b.i.d. with trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole (TMP 800 mg + SMX 160 mg), 1 tablet, b.i.d. The signs and symptoms of low respiratory tract infection were cured in 12 patients (80%) of the OFX group and improved in 2 other patients (13%); at the end of therapy, the 2 germs that persisted were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Branhamella catarrhalis. Clinical cure was achieved in 13 patients (86%) in the TMP-SMX group, while 2 patients were considered as failures (14%); after therapy, the 3 organisms that persisted were 2 S. pneumoniae and 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa. As far as urinary tract infections are concerned clinical cure and complete eradication of bacteria were achieved in 14 patients in the OFX group (93%); the germ that persisted was Escherichia coli (100,000 CFU), but the patient was asymptomatic. In patients of the TMP-SMX group the urinary infections were cured in 11 subjects (73%); the germs that persisted were 2 E. coli and 1 Proteus mirabilis. Adverse effects were reported for 3 patients (10%) in the OFX group and 4 patients (13%) in the TMP-SMX group. The measurement of serum and intracellular (polymorphonuclear cells and lymphocytes) levels of OFX and TMP-SMX and the assessment of the host's immunocompetence ruled out the possibility of any immunotoxicological side effect.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluations of cefpirome sulfate in the pediatric field. Pediatric Study Group of Cefpirome].
AB  - A research group was organized with the purpose of making basic and clinical studies on cefpirome sulfate (HR810, CPR), a newly developed cephalosporin antibiotic, in the pediatric field. Through meetings a joint research was done involving 19 key institutions and their related facilities throughout Japan. The obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. Antibacterial Activities Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined against 71 Gram-positive and 110 Gram-negative bacteria in the present clinical trials. CPR showed antibacterial activities 2-16 times higher than those of ceftazidime (CAZ) against Staphylococcus aureus and other Gram-positive bacteria including MRSA. Against Gram-negative bacteria, CPR showed a somewhat broad range of distribution in MIC against Branhamella catarrhalis, while the antibiotic inhibited the growth of all the strains of Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae at concentrations no more than 0.10 and 0.20 micrograms/ml, respectively. 2. Blood Concentrations and Urinary Excretion Rates The pharmacokinetics in pediatric patients was investigated with a dose of 20 mg/kg in most cases via one shot intravenous injection or 30- and 60-minute intravenous drip infusion. Mean blood concentrations of CPR at 15 minutes after one shot intravenous injection of 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg were 51.2, 70.5, and 123.5 micrograms/ml, with half-lives of 1.21, 1.39, and 1.53 hours, respectively. Urinary excretion rates in 6 hours were 63.6, 66.0 and 71.6%, respectively for the 3 dose levels. After 30- and 60-minute intravenous drip infusions at the same dose, the pharmacokinetic parameters observed were similar to those obtained with one shot injections. 3. Concentration in the Cerebrospinal Fluid CPR penetrated well into the cerebrospinal fluid in patients with purulent meningitis and levels of 1.85-24.2 micrograms/ml 45-60 minutes were achieved after intravenous injection at a dose of 40-80 mg/kg, the penetration rate of CPR was at an intermediate degree compared with other cephalosporin antibiotics. 4. Clinical Results Clinical efficacies of CPR on infectious diseases were analyzed in 454 plus 3 cases which were complicated with other infectious diseases, hence totaling 457 cases out of 499 cases originally chosen for clinical evaluation. The remaining 45 cases were excluded from the clinical evaluation. As for the clinical efficacy, CPR was found to be effective (good or excellent) in 430 (94.1%) of the 457 cases. CPR was found to be effective in 243 (95.3%) of 255 cases for which causative bacteria were identified. The efficacy rate was 92.6% (187 of 202) in those cases in which causative bacteria were not identified.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Ceftibuten and bactericidal kinetics. Comparative in vitro activity against Enterobacteriaceae producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  - Ceftibuten, compared to cefixime, cefetamet, cefpodoxime, loracarbef, cefprozil,  cefuroxime, cefaclor, and cefadroxil, was the most active oral cephalosporin derivative against Enterobacteriaceae producing plasmid-encoded broad spectrum beta-lactamases. In a pharmacodynamic model, ceftibuten was bactericidal for Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations simulating human serum levels following 200 mg, p.o., b.i.d.
TI  - Intravenous ciprofloxacin versus ceftazidime for treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection.
AB  - Intravenous ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were compared for efficacy in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection (UTI). Patients with nosocomial pneumonia were randomized to receive ciprofloxacin (as the lactate salt) 300 mg i.v. every 12 hours or ceftazidime (with sodium carbonate) 2 g i.v. every eight hours. Patients with UTI were randomized to receive ciprofloxacin 200 mg i.v. every 12 hours or ceftazidime 1 g i.v. every eight hours. Sputum and urine specimens were collected before, during, and after therapy. For patients with pneumonia, the organisms most frequently isolated before treatment began were Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Of the 17 pneumonia patients who completed ciprofloxacin treatment, 15 (88%) had resolution of signs and symptoms or improvement. Of the 15 ceftazidime-treated pneumonia patients, 13 (87%) had resolution or improvement. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus species, Acinetobacter species, and K. pneumoniae infections persisted for the ciprofloxacin treatment failures. Infections by Enterobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter species persisted for the ceftazidime treatment failures. For UTI patients, E. coli was the organism most frequently isolated before treatment. All 14 UTI patients who completed treatment showed resolution or improvement. In the ciprofloxacin group two patients were superinfected by Enterococcus species, and in the ceftazidime group there were two superinfections by Enterococcus species and one by Enterobacter cloacae. Intravenous ciprofloxacin was as effective as ceftazidime in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection. Caution should be exercised when treating serious infections by streptococci or staphylococci.
TI  - Primary sequence of the Escherichia coli fadL gene encoding an outer membrane protein required for long-chain fatty acid transport.
AB  - The fadL gene of Escherichia coli encodes an outer membrane protein (FadL) that plays a central role in the uptake of exogenous long-chain fatty acids. The nucleotide sequence of the fadL gene revealed a single open reading frame of 1,344 bp encoding a protein with 448 amino acid residues and a molecular weight of 48,831. The transcriptional start, analyzed by primer extension, was shown to be 95 bp upstream from the translational start. Apparent -10 and -35 regions were found at -12 and -37 bp upstream from the transcriptional start. Three regions with hyphenated dyad symmetry (two between the transcriptional start and the translational start and one upstream from the -10 and -35 regions) were identified that may play a role in the expression of fadL. The protein product of the fadL gene contained a signal sequence and signal peptidase I cleavage site similar to that defined for other E. coli outer membrane proteins. The N-terminal sequence of mature FadL protein was determined by automated amino acid sequencing of protein purified from the outer membrane of a strain harboring fadL under the control of a T7 RNA polymerase-responsive promoter. This amino acid sequence, Ala-Gly-Phe-Gln-Leu-Asn-Glu-Phe-Ser-Ser, verified the signal peptidase I cleavage site on pre-FadL and confirmed the N-terminal amino acid sequence of FadL predicted from the DNA sequence. Mature FadL contained 421 amino acid residues, giving a molecular weight of 45,969. The amino acid composition of FadL deduced from the DNA sequence suggested that this protein contained an abundance of hydrophobic amino acid residues and lacked cysteinyl residues. The hydrophobic amino acids within FadL were predicted to contribute to at least five regions of the protein with an overall hydrophobic character. The amino acid sequence of FadL was used to search GenBank for other proteins with amino acid sequence homology. These data demonstrated that FadL and the heat-modifiable outer membrane protein P1 of Haemophilus influenzae type b were 60.5% conserved and 42.0% identical over 438 amino acid residues.
TI  - Analysis of the immunoglobulin A protease gene of Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - The amino acid sequence T-P-P-T-P-S-P-S is tandemly duplicated in the heavy chain of human immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1), the major antibody in secretions. The bacterial pathogen Streptococcus sanguis, a precursor to dental caries and a cause of bacterial endocarditis, yields IgA protease that cleaves only the Pro-Thr peptide bond in the left duplication, while the type 2 IgA proteases of the genital pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae and the respiratory pathogen Haemophilus influenzae cleave only the P-T bond in the right half. We have sequenced the entire S. sanguis iga gene cloned into Escherichia coli. A segment consisting of 20 amino acids tandemly repeated 10 times, of unknown function, occurs near the amino-terminal end of the enzyme encoded in E. coli. Identification of a predicted zinc-binding region in the S. sanguis enzyme and the demonstration that mutations in this region result in production of a catalytically inactive protein support the idea that the enzyme is a metalloprotease. The N. gonorrhoeae and H. influenzae enzymes were earlier shown to be serine-type proteases, while the Bacteroides melaninogenicus IgA protease was shown to be a cysteine-type enzyme. The streptococcal IgA protease amino acid sequence has no significant homology with either of the two previously determined IgA protease sequences, that of type 2 N. gonorrhoeae and type 1 H. influenzae. The differences in both structure and mechanism among these functionally analogous enzymes underscore their role in the infectious process and offer some prospect of therapeutic intervention.
TI  - Protein D, an immunoglobulin D-binding protein of Haemophilus influenzae: cloning, nucleotide sequence, and expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The gene for protein D, a membrane-associated protein with specific affinity for  human immunoglobulin D, was cloned from a nontypeable strain of Haemophilus influenzae. The gene was expressed in Escherichia coli from an endogenous promoter, and the gene product has an apparent molecular weight equal to that of H. influenzae protein D (42,000). The complete nucleotide sequence of the gene for protein D was determined, and the deduced amino acid sequence of 364 residues includes a putative signal sequence of 18 amino acids containing a consensus sequence, Leu-Ala-Gly-Cys, for bacterial lipoproteins. The sequence of protein D shows no similarity to those of other immunoglobulin-binding proteins. Protein D is the first example of immunoglobulin receptors from gram-negative bacteria that has been cloned and sequenced.
TI  - Acute osteomyelitis in children. Reassessment of etiologic agents and their clinical characteristics.
AB  - One hundred thirty-five children with acute osteomyelitis were identified by chart review during a 7-year period, January 1, 1980, through December 31, 1986. Bacteriologic causes were detected in 75 (55%) of the patients. Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were identified in 34 (25%), 16 (12%), and eight (6%) children, respectively. Staphylococcus aureus occurred in all age groups, H influenzae type b occurred only in children younger than 3 years and was the number one cause of disease in this group. Pseudomonas aeruginosa occurred exclusively in children older than 9 years. Children with H influenzae type b had clinical and laboratory findings that were almost indistinguishable from a matched group of children with osteomyelitis due to other known bacteria, although children with H influenzae type b tended to have more joint effusions (63% vs 27%), less lower extremity disease (22% vs 70%), and fewer positive cultures from bone or joint aspirates (41% vs 89%). Unlike most pediatric cases of osteomyelitis, the ones due to P aeruginosa did not represent the hematogenous route of infection; penetrating injury to the foot was present in every case. Children with P aeruginosa infections were older than 9 years (100%), predominantly male (88%), often afebrile (83%), and never bacteremic. These data provide guidelines for the initial work-up and management of osteomyelitis in children.
TI  - Haemophilus influenzae: an important cause of maternal and neonatal infections.
AB  - Although Haemophilus influenzae is recognized as a major pathogen of infants, its role in maternal and neonatal infections is not as well appreciated. We analyzed the records of all mothers and neonates infected with H influenzae over a 10-year period. Twenty-eight mother/neonate sets were identified in which at least one had documented infection with H influenzae. Of the 18 mothers with documented infection, 13 had chorioamnionitis, endometritis, or both, and two of these mothers were bacteremic with H influenzae. Of the 23 infected neonates, 15 presented with early sepsis and/or pneumonia and nine had conjunctivitis. During the period of the study, only group B streptococci and Escherichia coli were more common as causes of early neonatal bacteremia. Under the conditions of this retrospective study, maternal infection predicted neonatal infection. However, prospective studies in which asymptomatic patients are cultured will be required to determine how well maternal colonization/infection with H influenzae predicts neonatal infection.
TI  - Fleroxacin combined with rifampin.
AB  - We determined the effect of the combination of rifampin and fleroxacin against Enterobacteriaceae and streptococcal species. None of the 65 isolates tested by checkerboard assay demonstrated synergy, 12% of isolates showed an additive effect; 86.7% were indifferent, and only 1 isolate showed antagonism. The mean FIC was 1.2. When using 2 and 8 micrograms/ml of rifampin, fleroxacin MICs of 285 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, staphylococci, streptococci, Bacteroides, and Clostridium were not increased, but synergy was not demonstrated. Time-kill studies against Escherichia coli, P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis failed to show increased killing when the two agents were present at one-half the MBC. The fleroxacin-rifampin interaction is one of indifference but provides coverage for species not adequately inhibited by fleroxacin.

TI  - Spontaneous remission from acute exacerbation of chronic adult T-cell leukemia.
AB  - Spontaneous remission without any anti-cancer therapy in a 57-year-old woman with adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is reported. The patient was referred to our department because of persistent cough and appearance of abnormal lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, and she was diagnosed as having chronic ATL. Eight months later, she was re-admitted because of cystitis, watery diarrhea and worsening of respiratory symptoms with an increase of ATL cells (WBC 31 x 10(9)/l with 56% ATL cells). Acute exacerbation of ATL was diagnosed. Interestingly, antibiotic therapy for the pulmonary and urinary tract infections brought about spontaneous reduction of the ATL cell count. Spontaneous remission of ATL continued for one year without chemotherapy. The role of infection as a trigger of acute exacerbation and spontaneous remission of ATL is discussed.
TI  - Nucleotide sequences of genes encoding the type II chloramphenicol acetyltransferases of Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae, which are sensitive to inhibition by thiol-reactive reagents.
AB  - Sensitivity of enzymes to inhibition by thiol-reactive reagents is often presented as evidence for the possible involvement of cysteine residues in substrate binding and catalysis or to highlight possible important differences in structure and mechanism between closely related enzymes. The primary phenotypic distinction between the enterobacterial type II chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CATII; typified by the enzyme encoded by the incW transmissible plasmid pSa) and the CATI and CATIII variants is the greatly enhanced susceptibility of CATII to inactivation by thiol-specific modifying reagents. Determination of the nucleotide sequence of the gene, catII, present on pSa and that of a related determinant, catIIH, isolated from Haemophilus influenzae indicates that sensitivity to such reagents cannot be due to the presence of additional reactive cysteine residues in CATII. Comparative analysis of the inactivation of CATII and CATIII by 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), 4,4'-dithiodipyridine (DTDP) and methyl methanethiosulphonate (MMTS) suggests that (i) inactivation occurs as a result of chemical modification of the same residue (Cys-31) in each enzyme, (ii) reagents that inactivate via a pseudo-first-order process (DTNB and DTDP) appear to bind with a greater affinity to CATII, and (iii) the intrinsic reactivity of Cys-31 in CATII greatly exceeds that of the corresponding residue in CATIII. The results lead to the conclusion that a striking difference in chemical reactivity of a unique and conserved thiol group between closely related enzyme variants may not be easily explained even when a high-resolution tertiary structure is available for one of them. Plausible explanations include more favourable access of reagents to Cys-31 in CATII or an enhanced reactivity of its thiol group imposed by the side chains of residues that are not in immediate contact with it.
TI  - Utilization of enterobactin and other exogenous iron sources by Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and H. paraphrophilus.
AB  - The ability of Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and H. paraphrophilus to utilize iron complexes, iron-proteins and exogenous microbial siderophores was evaluated. In a plate bioassay, all three species used not only ferric nitrate but also the iron chelates ferric citrate, ferric nitrilotriacetate and ferric 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate. Each Haemophilus species examined also used haemin, haemoglobin and haem-albumin as iron sources although only H. influenzae could acquire iron from transferrin or from haemoglobin complexed with haptoglobin. None of the haemophili obtained iron from ferritin or lactoferrin or from the microbial siderophores aerobactin or desferrioxamine B. However, the phenolate siderophore enterobactin supplied iron to both H. parainfluenzae and H. paraphrophilus, and DNA isolated from both organisms hybridized with a DNA probe prepared from the Escherichia coli ferric enterobactin receptor gene fepA. In addition, a monospecific polyclonal antiserum raised against the E. coli 81 kDa ferric enterobactin receptor (FepA) recognized an iron-repressible outer membrane protein (OMP) in H. parainfluenzae of between 80 and 82 kDa (depending on the strain). This anti-FepA serum did not cross-react with any of the OMPs of H. paraphrophilus or H. influenzae. The OMPs of each Haemophilus species were also probed with antisera raised against the 74 kDa Cir or 74 kDa IutA (aerobactin receptor) proteins of E. coli. Apart from one H. parainfluenzae strain (NCTC 10665), in which an OMP of about 80 kDa cross-reacted with the anti-IutA sera, no cross-reactivity was observed between Cir, IutA and the OMPs of H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae or H. paraphrophilus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Osteomyelitis in patient with sickle cell disease].
AB  - From 1977 to 1989, 23 children with sickle cell disease were identified as having 21 episodes of acute and 3 episodes of chronic osteomyelitis, respectively. The responsible organisms were found in 17 cases: Salmonella (12 cases), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (3 cases). Haemophilus influenzae (1 case), Escherichia coli (1 case). The mean age was 7 7/12 years. In 15 patients, osteomyelitis occurred in 1 bone; osteomyelitis of more than one bone was recorded in 9 cases. The most commonly affected bone was the femur (7 episodes); 5 episodes of hand-foot syndrome with osteomyelitis occurred in children in the first 2 years of life (mean age 16 months). Two patients had a Salmonella vertebral osteomyelitis. Incision and drainage were performed in 5 cases and bone aspiration in 9 cases. Etiologic agents were obtained with these two procedures in respectively 5 and 3 cases. Radionuclide scans were used in 7 episodes: uptake on bone scan was increased in 5 cases and normal in 2. In all cases, the outcome was satisfactory. Differentiation from acute bone infarcts in difficult. An extensive workup is required to confirm the diagnosis of infection: early scintigraphy, bone aspiration or surgical biopsy in patients with negative blood cultures should be performed. Until the results of cultures, the antimicrobial regimen chosen for initial therapy should be broad enough to treat the likely etiologic agents including Salmonella.
TI  - [Survey on clinical isolates from 13 hospitals in Akita Prefecture--changes in frequency and susceptibility of isolates by scale of hospital. Survey Group for Clinical Isolates, Chemotherapy Research Committee of Akita Prefecture].
AB  - Isolates from various clinical materials in 13 hospitals in Akita prefecture and  their drug susceptibility were investigated by the Chemotherapy Research Committee of Akita Prefecture during the period from Dec., 1987 to Feb., 1988. The results were as follows: 1. The total number of isolates was 8,387, including Staphylococcus aureus (18.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.9%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.3%) and Enterococcus faecalis (6.6%). S, aureus and P. aeruginosa were detected more frequently in the larger hospitals. 2. The detection frequency of S. aureus from the sputum, throat swab and pus exudate was also very high. There was a diversity in isolates from the urine and the frequency of Escherichia coli was low. More than half of the isolates from the blood were S. epidermidis and S. aureus. Many kinds of bacteria were detected from pleural fluid and ascites, but the isolate showed no particular tendency. 3. The susceptibility of S. aureus to oxacillin were variable in hospitals, and the susceptibility to cefazolin were even lower. Low susceptibility were also seen with norfloxacin. S. aureus showed the highest susceptibility to minocycline. The susceptibility was lower for inpatients than for outpatients. P. aeruginosa showed low susceptibility to cefsulodin. The number of ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae isolates tended to decrease. Enterobacter cloacae showed a low susceptibility for cephems. Serratia marcescens showed low susceptibility to many drugs. Based on the above results, we concluded that attention should be paid to S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and Enterobacter in clinical practice.
TI  - Antigenic similarities in lipopolysaccharides of Haemophilus and Neisseria and expression of a digalactoside structure also present on human cells.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies raised against Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were used to investigate similarities or differences in the lipopolysaccharide antigens of pathogenic and commensal strains of several Gram-negative bacteria indigenous to mucosal surfaces of humans. In immunoblotting experiments, 20 of 36 monoclonal antibodies showed cross-reactions between species of Neisseria and Haemophilus. The common epitopes were present on N. gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, N. lactamica, H. influenzae including biogroup aegyptius, and occasionally H. parainfluenzae. No other commensal Neisseria or Gram-negative organisms tested reacted with the monoclonal antibodies with one exception; a single strain of pathogenic Escherichia coli was recognised by a N. gonorrhoeae-specific monoclonal antibody. One monoclonal antibody, raised against N. gonorrhoeae lipopolysaccharide, reacted with N. gonorrhoeae (32 of 59 strains), N. meningitidis (9 of 26 strains), H. influenzae (6 of 16 strains). An epitope expressed by H. influenzae and implicated in its virulence was also present on 14 of 59 strains of N. gonorrhoeae and was shown to comprise a digalactoside structure, alpha-galactosyl-1,4-beta-galactose (Gal alpha 1,4Gal beta), also found on human cells.
TI  - [Prosthesis-endocarditis in the aortic position in a 22-year case load. Surgical  versus conservative treatment].
AB  - During the period 1965-1986, a total of 852 patients underwent isolated aortic valve replacement. With 4,875 patients-years at risk, 24 patients developed prosthetic valve endocarditis (PE; 0.49% per patient-year). The five, ten and fifteen year cumulative freedoms from PE were 98.2%, 95.4% and 93.0%, respectively. PE was unrelated to pre- or intraoperative data. No patients submitted to operation for acute/subacute bacterial endocarditis of the native aortic valve developed PE. Out of the 12 episodes of PE within two years of the operation, seven (58%) were caused by Staphylococcus albus compared with two out of 12 (17%; p less than 0.05) subsequent episodes of PE. Seven of the nine infections with Staphylococcus albus were caused by a highly resistant nosocomial variant. Ten of the PE patients underwent replacement of the prosthesis while 14 were treated conservatively. The two therapeutic groups were comparable, although the surgically treated patients tended to be younger and to have more impaired cardiac status. All surgically treated patients and all patients treated conservatively and in whom post mortem verification was possible had paravalvular defects, annular abscesses and/or vegetations on the prosthesis. The thirty-day, one year and ten year cumulative survivals were 80%, 80% and 50%, respectively, after replacement of the prosthesis and 64%, 21% and 7%, respectively, after conservative treatment (p = 0.02). A Cox regression analysis identified conservative treatment, infection with Escherichia coli or Haemophilus influenzae and the need to intensify digitalis/diuretic treatment for congestive heart failure as independent risk factors. It is concluded that replacement of the prosthesis early in the course of the disease should be considered as the treatment of choice.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - Efficacy of intravenous ofloxacin: a French multicentre trial in 185 patients.
AB  - The efficacy of intravenous ofloxacin therapy (200 mg 12-hourly) followed, when appropriate, by oral administration of the same dose was evaluated in an open multicentre trial involving 185 patients in 31 French hospitals. Dosage adjustment was made for patients in renal failure. Infection was hospital-acquired in 35 cases, 53 patients required admission to an intensive care unit. The infections comprised septicaemia (n = 56), pneumonia (n = 18), bronchitis (n = 10), urinary tract (n = 78), female pelvis (n = 8), bone and joint (n = 5), skin and soft tissues (n = 10). The causative pathogens were: Staphylococcus spp. (n = 23), Streptococcus spp. (n = 11), Escherichia coli (n = 85), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 9), Klebsiella, Enterobacter or Serratia spp. (n = 21), Salmonella spp. (n = 22), Chlamydia spp. (n = 3), Legionella spp. (n = 1), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n = 1) and miscellaneous Gram-negative bacilli (n = 17). All were ofloxacin-susceptible. Mean duration of therapy was 8.06 ( +/- 2.6) days for the i.v. and 14.8 ( +/- 14.39) days for the oral preparation. Clinical cure was achieved in 173 patients (93.5%). It is concluded that iv ofloxacin is an effective treatment for a range of infections due to susceptible organisms.
TI  - Molecular analysis of the Escherichia coli K5 kps locus: identification and characterization of an inner-membrane capsular polysaccharide transport system.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence has been determined of a region of the Escherichia coli K5 antigen gene cluster postulated to encode functions for the translocation of capsular polysaccharide across the inner membrane. This revealed two genes, designated kpsM and kpsT, organized in a single transcriptional unit. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of the KpsM and KpsT proteins indicates that they may function as dual components in a polysaccharide export system analogous to the periplasmic binding protein-dependent transport systems of Gram-negative bacteria. We propose that the KpsT protein acts as an energizer, coupling ATP hydrolysis to the transport process mediated by the KpsM protein. Extensive sequence homology between the KpsM and KpsT proteins and the products of the bexB and bexA genes present in the capsulation (cap) locus of Haemophilus influenzae, indicates that a common mechanism for the export of polysaccharide across the inner membrane may exist in these two micro-organisms.
TI  - The bex locus in encapsulated Haemophilus influenzae: a chromosomal region involved in capsule polysaccharide export.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a 5.1 kb region in the Haemophilus influenzae type b capsulation locus has been determined and found to contain four open reading frames: bexD, bexC, bexB, and bexA. Comparison of the deduced products of bexC, bexB, and bexA to known proteins, and TnphoA mutagenesis, suggests that they form components of an ATP-driven polysaccharide export apparatus. Furthermore, close sequence similarity between BexA and BexB and products of the kpsT and kpsM genes at the Escherichia coli K5 capsulation locus (Smith et al., 1990--accompanying paper) suggests that capsulation genes in these organisms may have a common ancestry.
TI  - In vitro activity of tosufloxacin, a new quinolone, against respiratory pathogens derived from cystic fibrosis sputum.
AB  - By using broth microdilution methods, the in vitro activity of tosufloxacin (A-64730), a new quinolone, was compared with those of other agents, including five quinolones, against geographically diverse cystic fibrosis sputum isolates obtained from 26 cystic fibrosis centers in the United States. These included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, conventional as well as especially resistant (ceftazidime, aztreonam, gentamicin, and/or tobramycin) isolates: Escherichia coli; Pseudomonas cepacia; Staphylococcus aureus; and Haemophilus influenzae. Tosufloxacin MICs for 50 and 90% of isolates of standard P. aeruginosa were 0.5 and 2.0 mg/liter, for resistant P. aeruginosa they were 4.0 and greater than 16.0 mg/liter, for E. coli they were less than or equal to 0.016 mg/liter, for P. cepacia they were 4.0 and 8.0 mg/liter, for S. aureus they were 0.063 and 0.063 mg/liter, and for H. influenzae they were less than or equal to 0.016 and 0.032 mg/liter, respectively. Tosufloxacin activities against standard and resistant strains of P. aeruginosa were similar to those of comparative quinolones. Against E. coli, tosufloxacin activity was similar to those of other quinolones. Against S. aureus, tosufloxacin activity was similar to those of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and cephalexin, but tosufloxacin was more active than other agents. Against H. influenzae, tosufloxacin activity was similar to those of other quinolones. There was minor diminution of activity at pH 8.2 but major diminution of activity at pH 5.2 and at inoculum sizes of greater than or equal to 10(7) CFU/ml. Activity was unaffected by sputum but was enhanced by serum and by the omission of cation supplementation. Tosufloxacin has consistent activity against common cystic fibrosis pathogens. Its high degree of activity against S. aureus with activity maintained against P. aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacteria of interest suggests that further in vitro studies and assessment of activity in in vivo models of cystic fibrosis pulmonary infections are warranted.
TI  - Light-dependent cytotoxic reactions of anthracene.
AB  - Anthracene is a photodynamic compound in vitro. In the presence of oxygen, it is  known to generate singlet oxygen and participate in Type II reactions. In aqueous solution, it also participates in Type I reactions, such as in the photoreduction of cytochrome c, which can be suppressed by superoxide dismutase. In argon, direct photoreduction of cytochrome c also takes place. Anthracene induces the photodynamic hemolysis of human erythrocytes and inactivates Escherichia coli cells photodynamically. By using a series of E. coli strains differing in DNA repair capabilities and catalase proficiency, sensitivity to inactivation by anthracene plus NUV was correlated with catalase deficiency rather than with particular repair deficiencies. The fact that carotenoid genes cloned and expressed in E. coli offered partial protection suggests that the membrane may be one possible target for inactivation by anthracene plus NUV. Anthracene plus NUV inactivated Haemophilus influenzae transforming DNA and led to nicking of supercoiled pBR322 DNA in vitro. In vivo, therefore, anthracene is a phototoxic molecule whose cytotoxicity could be the result of damage to more than one target.
TI  - Influence of subinhibitory concentrations of loracarbef (LY 163892) and daptomycin (LY 146032) on bacterial phagocytosis, killing and serum sensitivity.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate whether pre-exposure of bacteria to a subinhibitory concentration (sub-MIC) of loracarbef (LY 163892) or daptomycin (LY 146032) could modify bacterial susceptibility to serum bactericidal activity and to phagocytosis and killing by murine peritoneal macrophages and by human polymorphonuclear leucocytes. Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae type b and Staphylococcus aureus grown in the presence of one quarter the MIC of loracarbef, and S. aureus exposed to one quarter the MIC of daptomycin were phagocytosed and killed in numbers significantly higher than non-exposed bacteria. Pre-exposure to loracarbef resulted in increased susceptibility of E. coli and H. influenzae type b to the bactericidal activity of antiserum, but exposure to loracarbef or daptomycin did not modify serum sensitivity of S. aureus. Loracarbef treatment and antiserum enhanced phagocytosis and killing of E. coli and H. influenzae type b to a greater extent than either antibiotic treatment or antiserum alone. These data indicate that loracarbef and daptomycin at sub-MIC enhance the susceptibility of bacterial pathogens to cellular and host defence mechanisms.
TI  - Sequence and uptake specificity of cloned sonicated fragments of Haemophilus influenzae DNA.
AB  - Our data support the conclusion that all tight binding of DNA by competent cells  of Haemophilus influenzae is due to 9 base pairs (bp) of the 11-bp motif 5'-AAGTGCGGTCA or its inverse complement, TGACCGCACTT. Sonicated chromosomal DNA of H. influenzae was absorbed and extracted from competent cells to prepare a subpopulation of uptake fragments enriched for single uptake (binding) sequences. This DNA was inserted into the plasmid pUC18 and cloned into Escherichia coli. Whole sonicated chromosomal DNA was also cloned in pUC18 as a population of control fragments. Seventy-one plasmids were labeled with 3H and tested for DNA binding, and the inserts of 28 of them were sequenced. The control plasmid pUC18 was absorbed to competent H. influenzae cells at low levels of 5 to 10% of DNA added. The plasmids containing uptake inserts were mostly absorbed at levels of 70 to 80%, but a significant number contained inserts with an intermediate level of binding, 20 to 30%. The inserts of 15 plasmids were excised and tested for DNA uptake to demonstrate good agreement between uptake of these plasmids and their insert fragments. Sequencing of inserts revealed that the presence of 9 bp of the 11-bp motif was associated with tight binding. Some inserts with intermediate levels of binding had no significant similarities to the 9-bp sequence. The 9-bp sequence appeared to account for most of the binding to competent cells, but appreciable binding occurred with fragments without 9-bp homology. About one-third of the 9-bp uptake sequences were found as inverted repeats that could form strong stem-loop structures. It has been suggested by Goodman and Scocca (Proc. Nal. Acad. Sci. USA 85:6982-6986, 1988) that in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, uptake sequences occur as palindromes and act as transcription terminators. Although consistent, the data are insufficient to make this conclusion for uptake sequence palindromes in H. influenzae.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of a new quinolone, fleroxacin, against respiratory pathogens from patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - We evaluated fleroxacin, a newer fluoroquinolone, against isolates from sputum from patients with cystic fibrosis. These isolates included rough and mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Escherichia coli. Selected isolates were tested by the broth microdilution method to examine the influence of various pHs, inoculum sizes, and biological fluids (serum or sputum from patients with cystic fibrosis). Fleroxacin MICs for 50 and 90% of isolates of P. aeruginosa were 2.0 and 4 micrograms/ml, those for P. cepacia were 2 and 16 micrograms/ml, those for S. aureus were 0.5 and 1 microgram/ml, those for H. influenzae were 0.06 and 0.06 micrograms/ml, and those for E. coli were 0.01 and 0.03 micrograms/ml, respectively. Fleroxacin activity against mucoid P. aeruginosa was similar to the activities of enoxacin and ofloxacin but eightfold lower than that of ciprofloxacin. It was twofold more active than norfloxacin and enoxacin but was twofold less active than ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and nafcillin against S. aureus. Fleroxacin inhibitory activity against P. cepacia was two- to fourfold lower than that of ciprofloxacin but eightfold greater than those of the other quinolones tested. Alterations in pH, diluent, and inoculum size did not significantly affect fleroxacin activity. These results, combined with available pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution data, support the need for clinical evaluation of fleroxacin in pulmonary infections in patients with cystic fibrosis.
TI  - Monoclonal antibody-coated latex agglutination assay for identification of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to lipopolysaccharide of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strain Y4 (serotype b) and eight MAbs to a serotype b-specific polysaccharide antigen of strain Y4 were obtained. Latex particles sensitized with an MAb to the Y4 lipopolysaccharide produced a positive agglutination with whole cells of all three serotypes of A. actinomycetemcomitans, but not with Haemophilus aphrophilus, Haemophilus paraphrophilus, Haemophilus influenzae, Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis, "Bacteroides" intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Escherichia coli. On the other hand, latex particles sensitized with an MAb to the serotype b-specific polysaccharide antigen agglutinated with whole cells of serotype b A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis, but not with heated and trypsinized cells of P. gingivalis. The simple and rapid latex agglutination assay using MAbs may be useful for the identification of A. actinomycetemcomitans.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Antigenic conservation of the 15,000-dalton outer membrane lipoprotein PCP of Haemophilus influenzae and biologic activity of anti-PCP antisera.
AB  - A gene from Haemophilus influenzae encoding an outer membrane lipoprotein of about 15,000 daltons and which comigrates with the peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (PAL) of H. influenzae on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis has been previously reported and designated pcp gene, and its product has been designated PCP. in order to obtain specific immunologic probes for the analysis of PCP expression, cellular location, and antigenic conservation in H. influenzae, pcp was fused to the lac polylinker region of plasmid pUC19 and the hybrid gene was expressed in Escherichia coli. PCP purified from these cells was used to generate rabbit and mouse polyclonal antisera and mouse monoclonal antibody against PCP. Western immunoblot analysis with anti-PCP monoclonal antibody demonstrated that PCP is present and antigenically conserved in 30 tested strains of H. influenzae, including 27 clinical nontypeable strains. Polyclonal antiserum against PCP killed 9 of 11 clinical H. influenzae strains in a complement-mediated bactericidal assay, and bactericidal activity was additive with bactericidal activity of antisera against PAL. These results indicate that PCP is a potentially valuable component for a subunit vaccine against nontypeable H. influenzae disease, especially in combination with PAL or other components.
TI  - Deacylation of structurally diverse lipopolysaccharides by human acyloxyacyl hydrolase.
AB  - Acyloxyacyl hydrolase, a leukocyte enzyme previously has been shown to catalyze the hydrolysis of secondary (acyloxyacyl-linked) fatty acyl chains from the nonreducing glucosamine of the lipid A region of rough Salmonella typhimurium lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We describe here the activity of this enzyme toward smooth S. typhimurium LPS and LPS from Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Acyloxyacyl hydrolase released the secondary acyl chains from all of these lipopolysaccharides, regardless of the location of the acyloxyacyl linkage on the diglucosamine backbone or the structure of the acyl chains. The two acyloxyacyl linkages present in each LPS molecule apparently were hydrolyzed separately, so that free fatty acids released from the different sites accumulated at different rates. The purified enzyme also removed greater than 90% of the secondary acyl chains in each LPS, indicating that the enzyme acts not only on intact LPS but also on LPS molecules that have only one secondary acyl chain. The enzyme did not release the glucosamine-linked 3-hydroxyacyl chains. The specificity and versatility of the enzyme for cleaving acyloxyacyl linkages suggest that it may be a useful reagent for studying the structure and bioactivities of lipopolysaccharides with diverse carbohydrate and lipid A structures.
TI  - Tumor necrosis factor-alpha production of influenza A virus-infected macrophages  and potentiating effect of lipopolysaccharides.
AB  - Influenza A virus infections are commonly associated with symptoms that suggest involvement of TNF-alpha. In this study, we exposed human monocytes, rat alveolar macrophages, and murine PU5-1.8 macrophages to influenza A virus, strain Puerto Rico 8. We observed a productive infection that was accompanied by TNF-alpha mRNA accumulation, TNF-alpha release and subsequent cell death. TNF-alpha production was dependent on exposure to live virus, in contrast to IFN release that was also induced by UV-inactivated virus. Most strikingly, low amounts of LPS (1 to 10 ng/ml) from Escherichia coli or Haemophilus influenzae were capable of strongly potentiating TNF-alpha production from virus-infected macrophages. The potentiating effect of LPS was neither due to increased survival of macrophages nor to altered virus multiplication, enhanced TNF-alpha gene expression, discharge of intracellular TNF-alpha stores, or shifts in the kinetics of TNF-alpha release. Thus, low amounts of LPS, which could easily be present in vivo, may serve as a potent trigger signal for TNF-alpha production from macrophages that have been primed by influenza A virus infection. These data suggest that the frequently observed serious complications of combined influenza A virus and bacterial infections may be partially due to a high TNF-alpha production.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to estimate effective administrative dose of minocyclin. Reevaluation of in vitro MIC break points in disc susceptibility test].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of minocycline (MINO) against various clinical isolates, 270 strains obtained in 1988, were determined and the reliability of the MINO disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied. Clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the disc tests, which is widely used in Japan, and that of a 3 category system used in the USA and Europe, were also evaluated to determine which system would be more suitable for the evaluation of proper dose levels of administration. In this study, MICs were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. MIC80 values of MINO against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae were all less than or equal to 0.78 micrograms/ml. Those against Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris were 0.39, 6.25, 3.13, 25, 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. MIC80 values against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter spp., and Citrobacter spp. were 50, 100, 50 and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. The inhibition zones obtained with the disc method were compared with MICs. The results of MINO disc susceptibility test either with 200 micrograms disc (Showa) or 30 micrograms disc (prepared in this laboratory) were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disc method in estimating approximate values of MICs. In the 4 category classification system currently used, break points in MIC values proposed are ( ) MIC less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 2-10 micrograms/ml, (+) greater than 10-50 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 50 micrograms/ml. The results obtained with 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs showed false positive in 26.6% and 20.5% of the samples, and false negative in 5.8% and 23.6% of the samples, respectively. The disc results of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. pneumoniae, etc. were relatively well classified, but those of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Proteus spp. were not, showing more false positive results. Changing the lower 2 MIC break points in the 4 category system to: ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, the false positive results with both 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs were reduced to 12% and 6.2%, respectively. The false negative results were 5.8% and 23.6%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Studies on respiratory infections in primary care clinic (IV). Antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in the Tohoku District of Japan].
AB  - We determined the MICs of ampicillin, methicillin, cefaclor, cefixime, cefteram,  ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against a total of 1,448 strains from 11 species: 464 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 306 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 114 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 37 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, 329 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 32 strains of Escherichia coli, 66 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 26 strains of Enterobacter cloacae, 20 strains of Serratia marcescens, 12 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 42 strains of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, isolated from the throat swab and the sputum of 2,539 patients with respiratory infections who visited 21 private clinics in Tohoku district of Japan during the period from January to April in 1989. Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were more active against S. aureus, B. catarrhalis, P. aeruginosa and A. calcoaceticus than other antibiotics. Ampicillin and cefteram were more active against S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes than other antibiotics. New-quinolones and cephems of new-generation were active against H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae and S. marcescens. Of 30 strains of S. aureus which were resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml) to ampicillin, only one strain was resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml) to methicillin. Twenty strains (6.5%) of S. pneumoniae and 49 strains (14.9%) of H. influenzae were resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml) to ampicillin. Of 101 strains of H. influenzae of which their beta-lactamase activity was determined by Nitrocephin-method, 27 (26.7%) were beta-lactamase-positive strains. The above results indicated that MRSA is only rarely found in primary care clinics but the incidence of ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae in primary care clinics is almost the same as that of the intensive care clinic, i.e. medical school-affiliated hospitals. Therefore caution should be exercised as regards antibiotic resistance of the causative organism even in primary care clinics.
TI  - [Studies on respiratory infections in primary care clinic (III). Distribution of  bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in the Tohoku District of Japan].
AB  - The bacteriology of the isolates from the throat swab and the sputum respectively of 2,539 patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in Tohoku district of Japan during the period from January to April in 1989 was documented. Of the 2,539 patients, 1,694 had an acute upper respiratory infection, 609 had acute bronchitis, 46 had acute pneumonia, 84 had acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory infections and 106 had respiratory infections without diagnosis registered. 1887 (74.3%) strains of potential pathogens were recovered from 1507 (59.4%) of the 2539 cases. The rate of recovery of potential pathogens was very high in patients of the younger age. These patients had elevated body-temperature. There were statistically significant differences in recovery rate when classified by diagnosis, prefecture and the period of investigation. Of the 1,887 strains, 996 (52.8%) were gram-positive and 891 (47.2%) were gram-negative bacteria. The rate of recovery of gram-negative bacteria was high in patients who were less than 10 years old and more than 51 years old, in patients with pneumonia and chronic respiratory infections, and in patients with fever. Of the 1,887 strains, those which exceeded 100 were Staphylococcus aureus (481 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (340 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (329 strains), Streptococcus pyogenes (117 strains) and Acinetobacter spp. (100 strains). Species other than those mentioned above had less than 100 strains. In this group there were 39 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, 32 strains of Escherichia coli, 97 strains of Klebsiella spp., 40 strains of Enterobacter spp., 25 strains of Serratia spp., 12 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 43 strains of Pseudomonas putida. There was a remarkable difference in recovery rate of each species when classified by diagnosis, age class, prefecture and the period of investigation, respectively. The above results indicated that gram-positive bacteria are more frequent than gram-negative bacteria, that enterobacteriaceae and glucose-non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria are only rarely found in primary care clinics, and that the bacteriology in primary care clinic is different from that of medical school-affiliated hospitals.
TI  - A three year survey of clinical isolates in the United Kingdom and their antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  - A United Kingdom national survey of clinical isolates and their antimicrobial susceptibility was performed, with 61 participating hospital laboratories, between 1986 and 1989. Each centre used Microbe Base, a commercial suite of micro-computer programs which can record and analyse antimicrobial susceptibility data Informative on 366,853 bacterial isolates and their antimicrobial susceptibility was received from hospital and domiciliary specimens; Candida spp. accounted for a further 9121 isolates. The sites of origin were urine 51%, skin and soft tissue 21%, lower respiratory tract 8%, genital tract 7%, ear, nose and throat 6%, eye 3%, blood 1.5% and faeces 1%. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 242,307 isolates, the main species were Escherichia coli 48%, Proteus spp. 9%, Pseudomonas spp. 7%, Haemophilus influenzae 6% and Klebsiella spp. 4%. Gram-positive bacteria numbered 124,546 with a predominance of Staphylococcus aureus 42%, beta-haemolytic streptococci 20%, Enterococcus spp. 12%, coagulase negative staphylococci 10% and Streptococcus pneumoniae 5%. All pneumococci were sensitive to penicillin, and methicillin resistant in Staph. aureus was only 2%. Twelve per cent of H. influenzae strains were resistant to ampicillin. There were no significant levels of gentamicin resistance in Gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new oral cephalosporin Bay  v 3522.
AB  - The activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. Bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to MICs of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. It was more active against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. Groups B, C and G streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the MI"90 for Streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. Clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most Bacteroides spp. were resistant. The MIC90 for beta-lactamase positive Escherichia coli (producing primarily TEM-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. The MIC90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for Haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. Bay v 3522 was destroyed by TEM-1, SHV-1, TEM-3 and P99 beta-lactamases.
TI  - Interaction of integration host factor from Escherichia coli with the integration region of the Haemophilus influenzae bacteriophage HP1.
AB  - The specific DNA-binding protein integration host factor (IHF) of Escherichia coli stimulates the site-specific recombination reaction between the attP site of bacteriophage HP1 and the attB site of its host, Haemophilus influenzae, in vitro and also appears to regulate the expression of HP1 integrase. IHF interacts specifically with DNA segments containing the att sites and the integrase regulatory region, as judged by IHF-dependent retardation of relevant DNA fragments during gel electrophoresis. The locations of the protein-binding sites were identified by DNase I protection experiments. Three sites in the HP1 attP region bound IHF, two binding sites were present in the vicinity of the attB region, and one region containing three partially overlapping sites was present in the HP1 integrase regulatory segment. The binding sites defined in these experiments all contained sequences which matched the consensus IHF binding sequences first identified in the lambda attP region. An activity which stimulated the HP1 site-specific integration reaction was found in extracts of H. influenzae, suggesting that an IHF-like protein is present in this organism.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of nicotinamide riboside analogs against Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Exogenous NAD, nicotinamide mononucleotide, or nicotinamide riboside is required  for the growth of Haemophilus influenzae. These compounds have been defined as the V-factor growth requirement. We have previously shown that the internalization of nicotinamide riboside is energy dependent and carrier mediated with saturation kinetics. Thionicotinamide riboside, 3-pyridinealdehyde riboside, 3-acetylpyridine riboside, and 3-aminopyridine riboside were prepared from their corresponding NAD analogs. These compounds and several other nicotinamide riboside analogs were evaluated for their ability to support the growth of H. influenzae and for their ability to block the uptake of [carbonyl-14C]nicotinamide riboside by H. influenzae. 3-Aminopyridine riboside blocked the uptake of [carbonyl-14C]nicotinamide riboside and inhibited the growth of H. influenzae when NAD, nicotinamide mononucleotide, or nicotinamide riboside served as the V factor. The antibacterial activity of 3-aminopyridine riboside was found to be specific for H. influenzae but had no effect on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli. In additional experiments by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, it was determined that whole cells of H. influenzae degrade 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide to 3-aminopyridine riboside, which is then internalized. Inside the cell, 3-aminopyridine riboside has the ability to interfere with the growth of H. influenzae by an undetermined mechanism.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of six new oral cephem antibiotics.
AB  - Six newly developed oral cephem antibiotics, which included 5 with an aminothiazolyl side chain, viz., cefixime, cefotiam hexetil, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefteram pivoxil, ceftibuten, and one with a conventional side chain design, BMY 28100, were tested for their antimicrobial activities. Three traditional oral beta-lactam antibiotics, ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor, were used as reference antibiotics. The 5 aminothiazolyl cephems were more active than the reference drugs against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. All 6 new drugs showed poor activity against clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococci. They were better than cephalexin and cefaclor, but slightly poorer than or the same as ampicillin in activities against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Cefotiam hexetil, BMY 28100, and cefpodoxime proxetil were also more active than cephalexin against Staphylococcus aureus. Although the 6 tested new oral cephems demonstrated little difference in their activities against different bacteria, they all showed greater antimicrobial activity than the traditional oral antibiotics now in clinical use.
TI  - Cloning, nucleotide sequence, and expression of the HincII restriction-modification system.
AB  - Two genes, coding for the HincII from Haemophilus influenzae Rc restriction-modification system, were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli RR1. Their DNA sequences were determined. The HincII methylase (M.HincII) gene was 1,506 base pairs (bp) long, corresponding to a protein of 502 amino acid residues (Mr = 55,330). The HincII endonuclease (R.HincII) gene was 774 bp long, corresponding to a protein of 258 amino acid residues (Mr = 28,490). The amino acid residues predicted from the R.HincII and the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme found by analysis were identical. These methylase and endonuclease genes overlapped by 1 bp on the H. influenzae Rc chromosomal DNA. The clone, named E. coli RR1-Hinc, overproduced R.HincII. The R.HincII activity of this clone was 1,000-fold that from H. influenzae Rc. The amino acid sequence of M.HincII was compared with the sequences of four other adenine-specific type II methylases. Important homology was found between tne M.HincII and these other methylases.
TI  - Accumulation of trospectomycin by strains of Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia  coli and Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Trospectomycin, unlike aminoglycosidic aminocyclitols, is accumulated by a nonsaturable, energy-independent, diffusional process in Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae. A deep rough mutant of S typhimurium was more susceptible and accumulated the drug faster, and F porin deficient mutants of E coli were more resistant than parental strains. Trospectomycin likely uses both porin and nonporin pathways to cross the outer membrane. An E coli strain effectively accumulated the drug anaerobically, explaining its anaerobic activity. An H influenzae strain accumulated trospectomycin at concentrations below those for which detectable uptake could be observed with E coli or S typhimurium strains, consistent with greater activity in Haemophilus species.
TI  - In vitro activity of E-1040, a 3-substituted cephalosporin, against pathogens from cystic fibrosis sputum.
AB  - On the basis of preliminary in vitro data, we evaluated E-1040, a new cephalosporin, against 188 cystic fibrosis (CF) sputum isolates obtained from 26 CF centers in the United States. These isolates included mucoid and nonmucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Escherichia coli. In addition to MICs measured under standard conditions, selected isolates were tested at various pH values, inoculum sizes, and diluent (CF serum and sputum) conditions. E-1040 activities (MICs for 50 and 90% of the strains) against the isolates were as follows: P. aeruginosa (mucoid and nonmucoid), 1 and 4 micrograms/ml; P. cepacia, 4 and 16 micrograms/ml; S. aureus, 8 and 8 micrograms/ml; H. influenzae, 1 and 4 micrograms/ml; and E. coli, less than or equal to 0.12 and less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml. E-1040 activity against mucoid P. aeruginosa was 4-fold greater than that of aztreonam, 16-fold greater than that of ceftazidime, and 32-fold greater than that of piperacillin. E-1040 was similar to other broad-spectrum cephalosporins against S. aureus, H. influenzae, and E. coli. Bactericidal activity was less than or equal to 1 dilution of MIC for 88% of the strains, although kinetic studies with mucoid strains of P. aeruginosa demonstrated effective killing only at eight times the MIC. Variations in pH from 5 to 8, in inoculum size from 10(3) to 10(7) CFU/ml, and in diluent (CF serum or CF sputum) did not affect E-1040 activity.
TI  - [Synergy between sulbactam and ampicillin or cefoperazone in antimicrobial activity against beta-lactamase producing microorganisms. Results with the use of microdilution broth method].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of sulbactam (SBT) with ampicillin (ABPC) or with cefoperazone (CPZ), in other words, the effects of SBT, an beta-lactamase inhibitor, against beta-lactamase producing strains of clinical isolates, were studied using microdilution broth method. 1. beta-Lactamase producing strains such as Staphylococcus aureus, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae decompose benzylpenicillin (PCG) which is one of substrates of the acid-metry disc method and show a strong reaction, while they do not decompose cefazolin (CEZ), another substrate, showing no or weak reaction. Thus, it is suspected that beta-lactamases produced by these organisms are mainly penicillinase (PCase). MIC-distributions of ABPC and CPZ against these clinical isolates which seemed to produce PCase shifted to lower MIC ranges with MIC's reduced to 1/4 or below when 0.025 to 0.39 microgram/ml of SBT was added. 2. It appears that beta-lactamase produced by Proteus vulgaris may be oxyiminocephalosporinase (CXase), because P. vulgaris showed strong reaction on CEZ, but moderate reaction on PCG in the acid-metry disc method. MIC-distribution of ABPC and CPZ against P. vulgaris shifted to a lower range with MIC's of 1/4 or below when 0.20 to 0.39 microgram/ml of SBT was added. 3. All the test strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed strong reaction on CEZ but only 56% of the test strains showed reaction on PCG. It appears that the beta-lactamases which showed strong reaction on CEZ is cephalosporinase and is encoded in chromosome, while those beta-lactamase that showed strong reaction on PCG is encoded in a plasmid which was acquired secondarily by P. aeruginosa. MIC-distribution of CPZ against P. aeruginosa shifted to a lower range with MIC values of 1/2 or below with the addition of SBT at 1.56 micrograms/ml. 4. It appears that the synergy of SBT with ABPC or with CPZ against the PCase or CXase producing strains may occur in the presence of SBT at a concentration far less than that reported previously.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime proxetil in a pharmacokinetic in-vitro model.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime proxetil was studied in an in-vitro model simulating doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg. Strains of Klebsiella spp. Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Haemophilus influenzae were effectively reduced by a dose of 200 mg. While for Esch. coli no dose-activity relationship was observed--the maximal effect was achieved with a simulated dose of 100 mg--Staphylococcus aureus could be reduced effectively only by a simulated dose of 400 mg. The lower doses showed stepwise lower activities. Apart from broad spectrum beta-lactamases like SHV 2 or TEM 5 the presence of plasmid coded beta-lactamases in Esch. coli and H. influenzae did not affect the antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime proxetil. The results show that cefpodoxime was more active against Gram-negative bacteria than amoxycillin, and comparable activity to intramuscular cefotiam in the in-vitro model.
TI  - Sequence analysis and evolutionary perspectives of ROB-1 beta-lactamase.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the ROB-1 beta-lactamase gene from Haemophilus influenzae plasmid RRob was determined. The structural gene encodes a polypeptide of 305 amino acids, with an estimated molecular mass of 30,424 for the mature form of the protein. The ROB-1 gene showed low homologies with other beta-lactamases at the nucleic acid level. By using two statistical computer methods, assessment of the extent of similarity between ROB-1 and other known beta-lactamase amino acid sequences suggested that ROB-1 is a class A enzyme. Alignment of class A beta-lactamases with ROB-1 identified conserved residues. The use of a mutation matrix for detecting distance relationships indicated that ROB-1 has higher values and homologies with beta-lactamases of gram-positive bacteria, giving insight into its ancestry and divergence.
TI  - Expression in Escherichia coli of a high-molecular-weight protective surface antigen found in nontypeable and type b Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - An Escherichia coli clone producing a high-molecular-weight surface antigen of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) was isolated from a library of Hib DNA fragments cloned as lysogens in a lambda replacement vector. The antigen is found in sarcosyl-insoluble outer membrane protein preparations and was produced by all 36 H. influenzae isolates tested. Absorption studies indicated that the antigen is a surface determinant on all isolates tested. Antibodies to the antigen (D15) were found in eight of nine convalescent-phase sera from children with invasive Hib infection. Affinity-purified antibodies prepared against the cloned antigen gave protection against the development of bacteremia in a rat pup model.
TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of a Haemophilus influenzae type b lipooligosaccharide synthesis gene(s) that encodes a 2-keto-3-deoxyoctulosonic acid epitope.
AB  - The composition of lipooligosaccharide (LOS) can modify the virulence of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). A genomic library of Hib strain A2 was constructed in the lambda bacteriophage EMBL3. Twenty-six phage clones expressed a Hib LOS oligosaccharide epitope in Escherichia coli that was detected by the monoclonal antibody (MAb) 6E4. None of the clones bound a polyclonal sera specific for Hib A2 LOS or an anti-H. influenzae lipid A MAb. One clone, designated EMBLOS-1, assembled an oligosaccharide with an apparent molecular weight of 1,400 (the 1.4K oligosaccharide) on a 4.1K lipopolysaccharide (LPS) species in E. coli LE392 and produced a novel 5.5K LPS that bound 6E4. Binding of 6E4 to the 5.5K EMBLOS-1 LPS band was abolished by treatment with sodium metaperiodate but was not affected by digestion with proteinase K, confirming the carbohydrate nature of the epitope. The EMBLOS-1 Haemophilus insert hybridized to similar restriction fragments in type b and nontypeable strains regardless of whether they expressed the 6E4 epitope. The 6E4 epitope did not undergo phase variation in Hib strain A2 at a frequency of greater than 10(-3). The oligosaccharide of the Salmonella minnesota Re mutant and 2-keto-3-deoxyoctulosonic acid (KDO) inhibited binding of 6E4 to Hib A2 LOS. We conclude that a gene(s) encoding an enzyme(s) that assembles a stable Hib LOS epitope containing KDO is conserved in H. influenzae and that the cloned Hib LOS synthesis gene products assemble a Hib LOS epitope on an E. coli K-12 LPS core.
TI  - [Bacteriological and clinical studies on norfloxacin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Bacteriological and clinical studies on norfloxacin (NFLX) were carried out in the field of pediatrics, and the results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. The MICs of NFLX against clinically isolated organisms were determined to compare with MICs of nalidixic acid, amoxicillin, cefaclor, erythromycin and fosfomycin. NFLX had low MICs against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and, particularly, showed higher antimicrobial activity to Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae and Campylobacter jejuni than any other drugs tested. 2. Seventeen pediatric patients (11 cases of enteritis, 4 cases of urinary tract infections, 1 case of tonsillitis and 1 case of pyoderma) were treated orally with NFLX in daily doses ranging from 3.1 to 16.7 mg/kg t.i.d. for 6-14 days. Rates of clinical effectiveness and bacterial elimination were 94.1% and 58.8%, respectively. 3. None of the treated children showed clinical symptoms indicating the occurrence of side effects nor abnormal laboratory findings except 1 patient with eosinophilia. These results indicate the usefulness of NFLX in the treatment of bacterial infections in the pediatric field.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of norfloxacin in children].
AB  - Oral new quinolone, norfloxacin (NFLX, AM-715), was evaluated for its safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics in children. 1. NFLX was effective in 88.0% of 25 cases infected with Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, and other bacteria. 2. After single oral administration of 50 mg and 100 mg NFLX tablet at fasting, mean peak values of serum concentration were 0.35, 0.48 microgram/ml and T1/2 values were 2.2, 2.7 hours, respectively. 3. No adverse reactions suggestive for arthropathy were encountered with NFLX therapy with daily doses of 4.6-35.7 mg/kg (maximum 600 mg per day) and duration of 3 to 19 days. From these preliminary data, NFLX seems to have a place in the treatment of pediatric infectious diseases.
TI  - Therapeutic studies of cefepime (BMY 28142) in murine meningitis and pharmacokinetics in neonatal rats.
AB  - Cefepime (BMY 28142) was compared with ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and moxalactam for efficacy in treating experimental meningitis in mice and neonatal rats. Mice were infected intracranially with Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and treated intramuscularly. Five- to eight-day-old neonatal rats were injected intracisternally with Haemophilus influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and S. agalactiae and treated intraperitoneally. Cefepime was found to be the most active compound against induced meningitis in mice infected with S. agalactiae. Cefepime was as active as cefotaxime against Staphylococcus aureus meningitis, slightly more active than cefotaxime against S. pneumoniae and E. coli, and as active as ceftazidime against K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa meningitis. Cefepime was found to be the most active compound against S. pneumoniae and S. agalactiae meningitis in neonatal rats. Against H. influenzae, cefepime was as active as moxalactam and cefotaxime. Ceftazidime was the least active compound. The pharmacokinetics of cefepime in neonatal rats were similar to those of ceftazidime. Both compounds penetrated well into cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissues of uninfected neonatal rats. Relative concentrations were twice as high as those of cefotaxime and moxalactam.
TI  - Sensorineural hearing loss in children recovered from purulent meningitis: a study in Thai children at Ramathibodi Hospital.
AB  - Hearing loss is one of the serious complications of bacterial meningitis. Conventional audiometry and auditory brainstem response (ABR) methods were used to detect this complication in eighteen children who recovered from bacterial meningitis treated at Ramathibodi Hospital from January 1983 to December 1987. Six patients (33%) were found to have persistent bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Among them, the causes of meningitis were: Hemophilus influenzae (3 patients), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 patient), Streptococcus agalactiae (1 patient) and Escherichia coli (1 patient). Various clinical and demographic factors were examined in relation to the hearing loss, but no significant correlation was observed. Since meningitis often affects small children and makes conventional audiometry tests difficult, ABR was found to be a more effective method for testing this group of patients.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in general practice.
AB  - With the addition of several new oral antibiotics to those already available, there is the implication that bacterial resistance has become a significant problem in general practice. To test this hypothesis it is worth examining the susceptibilities of the major bacterial pathogens isolated from community based infections.

TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of LKP pilus genes from a nontypeable  Haemophilus influenzae strain.
AB  - Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae HF0295, isolated by aspiration from the middle ear of a patient with otitis media, expresses long, thick, and hemagglutinating pili of a single serotype (LKP1) on its surface. An intact pilus vaccine consisting of the LKP1 serotype protected chinchillas against experimental otitis media (C. C. Brinton, Jr., M. J. Carter, D. B. Derber, S. Kar, J. A. Kramarik, A. C. C. To, S. C. M. To, and S. W. Wood, Pediatr. Infect. Dis. J. 8:554-561, 1989; R. B. Karasic, D. J. Beste, S. C. M. To, W. J. Doyle, S. W. Wood, M. J. Carter, A. C. C. To, K. Tanpowpong, C. D. Bluestone, and C. C. Brinton, Jr., Pediatr. Infect. Dis. J. 8:562-565, 1989). The genes encoding LKP1 pili were cloned from a genomic library of the clinical strain as a 12.5-kilobase insert on a plasmid vector and inserted into Escherichia coli K-12. Transposon mutagenesis and deletion constructs mapped the pilus-coding region within a 7-kilobase region of insert DNA. The recombinant bacteria were found by electron microscopy to express pili morphologically similar to LKP1 pili. Purified pilus rods from the recombinant and its parental strain were composed of a single detectable protein with an apparent molecular weight of 27,500. Antibodies raised against LKP1 pili purified from H. influenzae immunologically reacted with pili from the recombinant bacteria. Pili from both strains also adhered to human erythrocytes and buccal cells with the same specificity.
TI  - Serious pediatric infections.
AB  - Third-generation cephalosporins are important additions to the range of antibiotics available for treating children with serious bacterial infections. They are highly active against the common pathogens, which cause bacterial meningitis in children. Strains of Haemophilus influenzae type b resistant to both ampicillin and chloramphenicol, and Streptococcus pneumoniae relatively resistant to penicillin remain susceptible to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter diversus, as well as the other more common gram-negative bacilli isolated from neonates and children are susceptible to these agents. However, Listeria monocytogenes is not cephalosporin-sensitive. Ceftazidime is the only third-generation cephalosporin useful for treating serious infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in children. As with other beta-lactam antibiotics, the clearance of cephalosporins is prolonged in neonates, particularly premature babies. Cefotaxime and ceftriaxone are equivalent to ampicillin and chloramphenicol for the treatment of bacterial meningitis in children over two to three months of age with respect to neurologic outcome and safety, despite the in vitro activity of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone being much greater than the standard antibiotics for the meningeal pathogens. Cefotaxime and ceftriaxone are effective in the treatment of serious gram-negative infections in children. In many instances, ceftriaxone can be administered once daily, which allows for more convenient therapy, particularly on an outpatient basis. Although controversial, ceftazidime has been used as single-agent therapy for empiric treatment of neutropenic immunocompromised children with fever.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of cefpodoxime: a comparison with other oral cephalosporins.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of cefpodoxime was studied in 529 clinical isolates and compared with the activity of other oral beta-lactams. Amongst the Enterobacteriaceae cefpodoxime was very active (MIC90 less than or equal to 1 mg/l--other than genera commonly possessing chromosomal beta-lactamases). Against these strains cefpodoxime was comparable in activity to cefixime and about eight-fold more active than cefuroxime and 8-16-fold more active than cefaclor and cephalexin. Staphylococcus aureus strains were moderately susceptible (MIC90 4 mg/l) to cefpodoxime in comparison with cefixime (16 mg/l). The respiratory pathogens, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Branhamella catarrhalis were susceptible to less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l cefpodoxime. An increase in inoculum from 10(4) to 10(6) cfu had little effect upon activity. Studies in beta-lactamase hydrolysis of cefpodoxime showed it to be stable to TEM-1, SHV-1 and BRO-1 enzymes but with high affinity for the P99 enzyme. The primary target of cefpodoxime is PBP3 (I50 1 mg/l) in Escherichia coli K12. The protein binding of the agent to human serum was 14.3-18.3% at 1 and 5 mg/l respectively.

AB  - In a five-year prospective study of blood culture-positive septicaemia in a Hong  Kong teaching hospital there were 2211 clinically-significant episodes, of which 16% occurred in children less than 15 years old. The microbiology and clinical features were broadly similar to those seen in Europe and North America, but with some important differences. Two-thirds of episodes were community-acquired. The most common organism isolated from community-acquired septicaemias was Escherichia coli and the source, most commonly, the urinary tract. However, the biliary tract was the second most common source of community-acquired infection (25%), reflecting the frequency of liver disease in Hong Kong. Three per cent of community-acquired septicaemias were associated with endocarditis; half of these were with viridans streptococci, usually in patients with rheumatic heart disease, and 40% were in drug addicts with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. The commonest organisms causing community-acquired childhood infections were Salmonella spp. (27%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (22%), whereas pneumococci accounted for only 3% of adult community-acquired micro-organisms. Haemophilus influenzae infections were uncommon and there was no case of meningococcal or gonococcal septicaemia. The commonest cause of hospital-acquired septicaemia was Staph. aureus (24%), of which 46% were methicillin-resistant. The characteristics of septicaemia in Hong Kong are influenced by the patient population structure, endemic disease patterns, local medical practice and socio-economic factors, but the rarity of Str. pneumoniae in adults and of H. influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis in children is unexplained.
TI  - Bacterial counts in cerebrospinal fluid of children with meningitis.
AB  - Eighty-five cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from the same number of pediatric patients with meningitis were examined to determine the bacterial count and the relationship of this count to the microscopy results, the ages of the patients and the bacterial species isolated. Bacterial counts ranged from 2 x 10 to 4 x 10(9) CFU/ml CSF. Twenty-five percent of the 85 CSF specimens positive for Haemophilus influenzae type b, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli K1 and group B streptococci had counts of 10(7) CFU/ml or higher. Children between 1 and 6 months of age had significantly higher counts (p less than 0.05) than the other age groups. The three patients who had positive CSF cultures 24 h after the start of therapy all had initial bacterial counts of 10(7) CFU/ml or higher. The detection limit for Gram stain/microscopy was 10(5) CFU/ml. No correlation was found between bacterial count and the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
TI  - The emergence of bacterial resistance in hospitals--a need for continuous surveillance.
AB  - The antibiotic sensitivities of a total of 220,000 isolates from 44 hospitals collected over 2.5 years were monitored by computer. Gram-negative organisms account for 63% of the total, the most common being Escherichia coli (43%). Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated Gram-positive organism (44%). The organism most commonly isolated from blood was E. coli; this organism was susceptible to ceftazidime (100%), ampicillin (47%), gentamicin (99%) and co-trimoxazole (85%). The organism most frequently isolated from sputum was Haemophilus influenzae; this organism was susceptible to ceftazidime (99%), cefuroxime (99%), ampicillin (89%) and erythromycin (78%). A 15-fold increase in the use of ceftazidime over the past 4 years has not been accompanied by increased resistance in common pathogens. Analysis shows that the susceptibility of E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to ceftazidime has remained constant throughout the duration of this survey. The data collected from this type of survey can be used to determine local trends in antibiotic susceptibility and hence aid the rational use of antibiotics in hospitals.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a pilin specific for Brazilian purpuric fever-associated Haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegyptius (H. aegyptius) strains.
AB  - Brazilian purpuric fever (BPF) is a recently described fatal pediatric disease caused by systemic infection with Haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegyptius. Previous studies have shown that all H. influenzae biogroup aegyptius strains isolated from BPF cases and case contacts share several unique phenotypic and genotypic characteristics that differentiate them from other H. influenzae biogroup aegyptius strains isolated from conjunctivitis cases in Brazil. One key characteristic of this BPF clone is reactivity in a BPF-specific monoclonal antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We have purified and partially characterized a pilin, referred to as the 25-kilodalton (kDa) protein. Aggregates of this protein contain a heat-labile epitope which is recognized by a monoclonal antibody used in the BPF-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The protein has a molecular weight of approximately 25,000, is insoluble in most detergents, and fractionates with outer membrane vesicles after LiCl extraction. Biochemical analysis of the 25-kDa protein shows it to have an amino acid composition similar but not identical to that of the H. influenzae type b pilin. The sequence of 20 N-terminal amino acids of the 25-kDa protein shows almost complete homology with the N terminus of the H. influenzae type b pilin and the types 1 and P pilins of Escherichia coli. Transmission electron microscopic analysis of the purified protein shows the presence of filamentous structures similar in morphology to those of H. influenzae pili. Reactivity between the 25-kDa protein and the BPF-specific monoclonal antibody is demonstrated by Western blotting (immunoblotting) and colloidal gold-enhanced immunoelectron microscopy. Hemadsorption analysis shows that expression of this protein is associated with increases in piliated cells and enhanced binding of these cells to human erythrocytes. These studies indicate that expression of the 25-kDa protein is a characteristic unique to the BPF clone and suggest that this protein plays a role in the pathogenesis of BPF.
TI  - Cloning, expression, and sequence analysis of the Haemophilus influenzae type b strain M43p+ pilin gene.
AB  - By using antiserum against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) strain M43p+ denatured pilin, we screened a genomic library of Hib strain M43p+ and identified a clone that expressed pilin, but not assembled pili, on its surface. Southern blot analysis revealed the presence of one structural gene, which was also present in strain M42p-, a nonpiliated variant. Five exonuclease III deletion mutants, two of which had deletions that extended into the structural gene and failed to express pilin, were used to obtain the nucleotide sequence of the structural gene. The amino acid sequence of the open reading frame agrees with 38 of 40 amino acids from the published sequence of purified Hib M43p+ pilin. The pilin gene coded for a mature protein of 193 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 21,101 daltons. Comparison of the Hib M43p+ pilin amino acid sequence with those of pilins of other bacteria revealed strong conservation of amino- and carboxy-terminal regions in M43p+ and Escherichia coli F17, type 1C, and several members of the P pili family, as well as Klebsiella pneumoniae type 3 MR/K, Bordetella pertussis serotype 2, and Serratia marcescens US46 fimbriae.
TI  - Construction of an efficient overproducer clone of HinfI restriction endonuclease using the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - We describe the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique to alter transcriptional and translational signals surrounding a gene so as to achieve overexpression in Escherichia coli. By changing the ribosome-binding site sequence preceding the hinfIR gene to match the consensus E. coli signal and by adding a transcription terminator sequence immediately following the gene, the yield of HinfI was increased about tenfold over that obtained from the natural Haemophilus influenzae signals. The addition of the positive retroregulator stem-loop sequence derived from the crystal protein-encoding gene of Bacillus thuringiensis downstream from the hinfIR gene further increased yields by twofold to a level of 13% of the total cellular protein.
TI  - [Clinical and pharmacokinetic studies on aztreonam in neonates].
AB  - Clinical and pharmacokinetic studies on aztreonam (AZT) were performed in neonates. The results are summarized as follows: A total of 6 cases consisting of 5 mature and 1 low-birth-weight infants was clinically evaluated. AZT 20 mg/kg was administered 2-3 times daily, via 1 hour intravenous drip infusion for 6-21 days. Concomitantly, vancomycin (VCM) 15 mg/kg was administered to 1 case 3 times daily, via 1 hour intravenous drip infusion for 3 days and ampicillin (ABPC) 20-50 mg/kg to 3 cases 3 time daily via 30 minutes intravenous drip infusion for 2-6 days. Of the 6 bacterial infection cases (1 with sepsis and purulent meningitis, 2 with sepsis, 2 with urinary tract infection and 1 with perirectal abscess), clinical effects of AZT were evaluated in 4 cases (2 each with sepsis and urinary tract infection) as "excellent" in all the cases. All of the causative organisms (Escherichia coli in 3 and Enterobacter cloacae in 1) were eradicated by the treatment with AZT. Neither clinical side effect nor abnormal laboratory test value caused by AZT was observed. MICs of AZT against 10 clinical isolates (Staphylococcus aureus 1, E. coli 4, Klebsiella pneumoniae 1, E. cloacae 1, Haemophilus influenzae 1 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2) from neonatal patients with bacterial infections were examined. As results, AZT showed very good antibacterial activity comparable or even superior to cefoperazone, cefotaxime, latamoxef; however, the activity against P. aeruginosa was inferior to imipenem.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Interpretive criteria and quality control limits for ceftibuten disk susceptibility tests. Collaborative Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing Group.
AB  - In vitro studies were undertaken to evaluate susceptibility tests with 30-micrograms ceftibuten disks. The following interpretive criteria were proposed: less than or equal to 17 mm for resistance (MIC, greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml) and greater than or equal to 21 mm for susceptibility (MIC, less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml). A multilaboratory quality control study led to the conclusion that Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 should provide zones 29 to 35 mm in diameter.
TI  - Role of protonated and neutral forms of macrolides in binding to ribosomes from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Erythromycin binds to a single site on the bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit and perturbs protein synthesis. However, erythromycin contains desosamine and thus exists in both protonated (greater than 96%) and neutral (less than 4%) forms at physiological pH because of the pKa of the dimethylamino group. We therefore examined the relative roles of both forms in binding to ribosomes isolated from two species each of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. We developed a system to directly measure the forward (association) rate constant of formation of the macrolide-ribosome complex, and we have measured both the forward and reverse (dissociation) rate constants as a function of pH. Forward rate constants and binding affinity did not correlate with pH when the interaction of erythromycin with ribosomes from both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was examined, demonstrating that the protonated form of this macrolide binds to ribosomes. Conversely, the neutral form of macrolide cannot be the sole binding species and appears to bind with the same kinetics as the protonated form. Forward rate constants were 3- to 4-fold greater at physiological pH, and binding affinity calculated from rate constants was 5- to 10-fold greater than previously estimated. Similar results were obtained with azithromycin, a novel 15-membered macrolide that contains an additional tertiary amine in the macrolide ring. Ribosome- and macrolide-specific kinetic parameters were demonstrated at neutral pH and may be related to the potency of the two macrolides against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Capsulation in distantly related strains of Haemophilus influenzae type b: genetic drift and gene transfer at the capsulation locus.
AB  - Among natural populations of capsulate Haemophilus influenzae, clones of strains  with type b capsular polysaccharide are found in each of two widely separated phylogenetic divisions. The chromosomal capsulation locus found in strains from either division has a three-segment organization, with serotype-specific DNA nested between elements common to all serotypes, but pairwise comparison of the segments between the divisions suggests that they have distinct phylogenetic histories. Genes clustered in one of the non-serotype-specific segments appear to have diverged from an ancestral element, reflected in 12% nucleotide sequence divergence in one homologous pair. In contrast, genes conferring the capacity to produce type-specific polysaccharide exhibit no such divergence, and we speculate that these have been subject more recently to horizontal transfer within the bacterial population. Clinically important capsulate gram-negative bacteria share a common organization of their capsulation loci, arguing convergence on a successful arrangement of genes. In H. influenzae this appears to have allowed the occasional exchange of serotype-specific capsulation genes between strains, a event of potential clinical importance in this major bacterial pathogen.
TI  - Molecular analysis of the Haemophilus influenzae type b pilin gene.
AB  - A Haemophilus influenzae DNA library was prepared in the vector lambda EMBL3, and recombinant phage were screened for the pilin gene (pil) using a synthetic oligonucleotide. Southern blot analysis of the positive clones revealed a 2.5kb PstI/PvuI fragment that hybridized with the oligonucleotide probe. This fragment was subcloned into pBR322 and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence disclosed an open reading frame of 653 bases. The deduced amino acid sequence corresponded with the known amino acid sequence of the purified pilin protein. Primer extension analysis using total RNA from piliated H. influenzae cells delineated a start site for the gene, -10 and -35 promoter regions, and a ribosome-binding site. No transcripts were seen with the RNA derived from a non-piliated strain. Southern blots of DNA from a number of H. influenzae strains revealed homology with the pil structural gene. DNA from a non-piliated strain of H. influenzae also hybridized with the pil probe. Transcriptional and translational studies were performed in Escherichia coli with plasmids containing: (i) the pil gene on the 2.5 kb PstI/PvuI fragment, (ii) the pil gene fused to the phoA gene, and (iii) the pil gene present on a 12.2 kb insert containing extensive H. influenzae DNA flanking the pil gene. The results suggest that the H. influenzae pil gene is expressed in Escherichia coli, but from a promoter other than the one used in H. influenzae.
TI  - Improved plasmid shuttle vectors for Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli.
AB  - In vitro deletion and transposon mutagenesis experiments were performed to localize the region essential for plasmid RSF0885 replication to a 1.7-kb sequence downstream from the beta-lactamase gene. This locus was named rep, for replication. Plasmid RSF0885 can replicate in both Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli. Replication in E. coli depended on transcription run-off from the beta-lactamase promoter into the rep locus. Insufficient transcription into the rep locus could account for the instability of this plasmid in an E. coli background, a property which reduced its usefulness as a shuttle vector. Therefore, four improved shuttle vectors for H. influenzae and E. coli were constructed. They possess the Co1E1 replication origin for maintenance in E. coli and the plasmid RSF0885 rep locus for maintenance in H. influenzae. Together, they provide twelve unique restriction sites for cloning by insertional inactivation of drug-resistance genes.
TI  - Multicenter in vitro comparison of piperacillin and nine other antibacterials against 1,629 clinical isolates.
AB  - The antibacterial spectrum of activity of piperacillin was compared with that of  other antibiotics against isolates of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, Enterococcus sp, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides bivius, and Clostridium difficile obtained from laboratories at hospitals in St. Louis, in Memphis, and in Newark, New Jersey. Of the 1,629 isolates tested, 91% were susceptible to piperacillin, 90% to mezlocillin, 87% to ticarcillin/clavulanate and imipenem, 83% to ceftazidime, 81% to cefoperazone, 80% to ciprofloxacin, 77% to ceftriaxone, 71% to aztreonam, and 51% to cefoxitin.
TI  - Model simulation of a single oral dose of cefuroxime axetil and the related in-vitro kill kinetics against four bacterial species.
AB  - An in-vitro model was shown to be capable of simulating a cefuroxime serum profile equivalent to that observed in human volunteer studies, following a single dose of 250 mg cefuroxime axetil. The model was used to carry out kill kinetic studies and showed cefuroxime to lyse the four bacterial test strains, time of onset of lysis being related to the sensitivity of the respective organisms. The more sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae strains were subject to a higher absolute kill and showed no regrowth over the duration of the simulated serum profile. In contrast, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli showed regrowth after 4 and 5 h respectively. The kill kinetic profiles of the respective organisms are discussed in relation to the pharmacokinetic analysis of the cefuroxime serum profile.
TI  - Relationship of high tissue concentrations of azithromycin to bactericidal activity and efficacy in vivo.
AB  - Measurement of killing kinetics of azithromycin against strains of Streptococcus  pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae in vitro showed that it had a limited bactericidal activity (greater than 90% kill) for the first eight hours of incubation, but developed complete bactericidal activity (greater than 99.9% kill) by 24 h incubation. Since high and sustained tissue levels of azithromycin occur in animals and humans, it was proposed that it might produce a bactericidal effect in vivo. This was demonstrated in a lung infection model in mice, designed to mimic the in-vitro killing studies. A 25 mg/kg dose of azithromycin given 24 h before intranasal challenge reduced the recoverable Str. pneumoniae population by greater than 99.9%, in comparison with untreated controls. Erythromycin did not produce a bactericidal effect at 100 mg/kg, and roxithromycin only reduced the viable count by 96%, at a dose of 50 mg/kg. Against a K. pneumoniae lung infection, a 50 mg/kg dose of azithromycin reduced the bacterial count by 99%. The bactericidal effect was correlated with lung tissue concentrations of azithromycin. In a proliferating Escherichia coli paper disc infection model, extravascular fluid concentrations of azithromycin were correlated with a 99.9% reduction in bacterial count, while corresponding serum concentrations were always less than the MIC. Dosing with azithromycin eradicated Haemophilus influenzae from the bulla (middle ear) of gerbils, as was not the case with erythromycin and roxithromycin. This effect was correlated with the antibiotic concentration in bulla lavage.
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1987)].
AB  - Since 1981, in cooperation with research institutions across the nation, Ikemoto, et al. have been collecting clinical isolates from patients with respiratory tract infections and conducting an annual retrospective survey of patients' background factors and of isolated strains and their sensitivities to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics. In the period from October, 1987 to September, 1988, 17 institutions participated in the survey and a total of 706 strains which were demonstrated to be causative organisms were isolated from 562 patients with respiratory tract infections. Strains were mostly isolated from the sputum. The taxonomic breakdown of these strains was: Staphylococcus aureus (69 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (120), Haemophilus influenzae (170), Mucoid-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa (42), Non-mucoid-producing P. aeruginosa (87), Escherichia coli (11), Klebsiella pneumoniae (35), Brahamella catarrharis (72), etc. Of these strains, 629 were used to determine MICs of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics for susceptibility analyses. Relationships between patient backgrounds and diagnoses and between infections diseases and causative organisms were also investigated. Most of the major causative organisms, such as H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa, showed no substantial changes from previous years, with regard to their sensitivities to antibiotic agent, but S. aureus, particularly methicillin/cephem-resistant strains of S. aureus (MCRSA) showed somewhat lower sensitivity to beta-lactams, and as in recent years, to ofloxacin, a new quinolone drug, as well. Regarding background factors of patients, the age distribution was heavily concentrated in age brackets of 50 years and older, thus patients in these age group accounted for 75.2% of all the patients, which was comparable to 73.5% in 1985 and 77.9% in 1986. Among infections encountered, bacterial pneumonia was most frequent at 28.3%, followed by chronic bronchitis (27.2%) and bronchiectasis (16.0%). Bacterial pneumonia was actually the most frequent, throughout the entire age groups accounting for 34.3% of patients up to 29 years, 26.6% in the group of 30-69 years and 30.7% in patients aged 70 years and older. Chronic bronchitis was next most frequent and accounted for 20.0%, 26.4% and 30.7% among the three age groups, respectively. Breaking down clinical isolates by diagnosis, H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa were isolated frequently from most of the infectious diseases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Genetics of capsular polysaccharide production in bacteria.
AB  
TI  - Bacterial agents associated with bronchopulmonary disorders in eastern Nigeria.
AB  - Altogether 16,539 sputum specimens were examined microbiologically from 1980 to 1984. Out of these 12,588 were screened by Ziehl-Neelsen's staining technique and 782 were (6.3%) found AFB-positive. Age and sex distributions of the AFB-positive individuals were statistically significant (at 0.05), incidence being most prevalent among those 20 years and above (90.2%) and among males (61.2%). From other specimens cultured, non-AFB organisms were isolated at the following frequencies: coliform-like organisms (15.1%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (55.5%). Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.3%), Streptococcus pyogenes (3.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.4%), Haemophilus influenzae (3.0%). Proteus Spp. (0.7%) and Escherichia coli (0.5%). The antibiogram of these isolates revealed a high incidence of multiple antibiotic resistance, a situation that has most probably arisen from the high degree of antibiotic misuse in Nigeria.
TI  - [Broncho-alveolar lavage in HIV-1 seropositive children].
AB  - Sixteen bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) were performed in 15 children with HIV1 seropositivity, 12 of them being infected by HIV1. BAL was performed during episodes of acute pneumonitis with respiratory distress (group I: three cases) or without severity (group II: five cases), or in the presence of asymptomatic radiological pulmonary abnormalities (group III: seven cases). A specific diagnosis of infection was obtained in five cases of acute pneumonitis and 12 micro-organisms were identified by BAL: three cytomegaloviruses, three respiratory syncytial viruses, two Pneumocytis carinii, one Haemophilus influenzae, one Herpes simplex virus type 1, one Escherichia coli and one group A streptococcus. In three cases two micro-organisms were simultaneously identified. Cytological examination showed a high proportion of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in cases of acute pneumonitis (group II) and alveolar lymphocytosis in clinically asymptomatic children with radiological pulmonary abnormalities (group III). BAL appears to be a reliable tool for the investigation of pulmonary infections in children with HIV1 seropositivity. In addition it has the advantage of revealing latent cytological abnormalities in these patients.
TI  - Reaction products of chloramphenicol acetyltransferases from enterobacteria and Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The reaction products of Types I, II and III chloramphenicol acetyltransferases (CATs) from reference strains of Escherichia coli and Type II CATs from clinical isolates of Haemophilus influenzae were examined by HPLC. Types I and III CATs produced 1, 3 diacetylchloramphenicol at pH 6.8 and 7.8 whereas Type II enzymes failed to produce this diester at either pH. All the CATs produced monoacetylchloramphenicol at both pH values. Neither mono- nor di-acetylchloramphenicol was stable. Breakdown of enzymically-produced mono- and di-esters proceeded more rapidly at pH 7.8 than at pH 6.8. Similar breakdown behaviour was observed with synthetically manufactured 1, 3 diacetylchloramphenicol.
TI  - [Clinical studies on cefixime in pediatrics].
AB  - Clinical usefulness of cefixime (CFIX), a new oral cephalosporin antibiotic, in pediatric field was investigated. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. The clinical efficacy of CFIX was investigated in a total of 138 children including 49 with upper respiratory tract infections (RTI), 22 with acute bronchitis, 18 with pneumonia, 19 with scarlet fever and 21 with urinary tract infections (UTI). 2. Clinical effectiveness was excellent in 58, good in 60, fair in 14 and poor in 3, with an overall efficacy rate of 87.4%. The efficacy rate classified according to types of infection were 85.7% in upper RTI, 89.5% in acute bronchitis, 94.4% in pneumonia, 78.9% in scarlet fever, and 90.5% in UTI. 3. Out of the suspected causative organisms, 43 strains of a total of 50 strains isolated were eradicated. The bacteriological eradication rate was 86.0%. (Haemophilus influenzae 100%, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 100%, Streptococcus pyogenes 88.5%, Escherichia coli 85.7%). 4. One hundred forty four children were analyzed for side effect. Side effects were observed in 2 children (1.4%) with diarrhea in 1 and anorexia in another. Abnormal laboratory test results were recorded in 4 children (3.3%). The above results suggest that CFIX is a very useful new oral cephalosporin for the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of KT3777, a new orally active carbacephem.
AB  - KT3777 is a novel carbacephem antibiotic structurally identical to cefaclor (CCL), except that the sulfur atom of position 1 of the cephem nucleus has been replaced by carbon. KT3777 was investigated for in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities in comparison with CCL, cephalexin (CEX) and amoxicillin. The MIC50 of KT3777 ranged from 0.2 to 3.13 micrograms/ml for clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. KT3777 possessed an antibacterial spectrum and potency similar to that of CCL. However, against E. coli and K. pneumoniae, KT3777 was about twice as active as CCL. KT3777 was more active than CEX against all strains tested. Killing-curve studies demonstrated bactericidal activity of KT3777 at concentrations above the MIC. KT3777 showed good affinity for penicillin-binding proteins 1A, 1Bs, 3 and 4 of E. coli NIHJ JC-2. The protective effect of KT3777 against systemic infections in mice was comparable to that of CCL with a few exceptions and about 3 to 7 times greater than that of CEX. KT3777 also proved effective against localized infections such as acute pneumonia and ascending urinary tract infections in mice.
TI  - Intravenous ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime in serious infections. A prospective, controlled clinical trial with third-party blinding.
AB  - Oral ciprofloxacin has been shown to be effective in the treatment of infections  due to gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods. The efficacy and safety of intravenous ciprofloxacin was compared with that of intravenous ceftazidime in the treatment of 59 patients with well-documented serious infections in a prospective, controlled, randomized study with a third-party blinding. Thirty-three patients were treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin (200 mg every 12 hours, plus a daily extra placebo dose); 26 patients were treated with ceftazidime (1 g every eight hours). The severity of the infections, underlying diseases, and demographic features were comparable in both groups, although there were more men in the ciprofloxacin group. For ciprofloxacin/ceftazidime treatments, respectively, the evaluated infections were: pyelonephritis (16 patients/nine patients), pneumonia (three/five), soft-tissue infections (four/zero), spontaneous peritonitis (five/two), primary bacteremia (three/eight), and other (two/two). Isolated pathogens included: Escherichia coli (22/12), Klebsiella sp. (five/four), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (two/three), Haemophilus influenzae (one/one), Proteus mirabilis (two/zero), Proteus vulgaris (one/zero), Salmonella sp. (zero/two), Plesiomonas shigelloides (one/zero), and others (one/four). The clinical responses were cure or improvement in 31 ciprofloxacin cases/21 ceftazidime cases; failure, zero/four; and indeterminate, two/one. The bacteriologic responses were eradication in 28 ciprofloxacin cases/22 ceftazidime cases; persistence, one/three; and indeterminate, four/one. Mild intolerance occurred in three ciprofloxacin cases and two ceftazidime cases. A mild increase in serum hepatic enzymes was observed in two patients in each group. Superinfections occurred in five patients: enterococcal septicemia (zero/two) and urinary tract infections (one/two). The results presented suggest that intravenous ciprofloxacin is an effective and safe antimicrobial agent for the treatment of serious infections, with an efficacy comparable with that of ceftazidime, a broad-spectrum cephalosporin. An additional advantage seems to be a lower rate of superinfections.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin in patients with bacteremic infections. The Spanish Group for the Study of Ciprofloxacin.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of 68 episodes of bacteremia were studied. Patients were treated intravenously (30 cases), orally (13 cases), or with sequential intravenous/oral therapy (25 cases). Intravenous doses ranged from 200 to 400 mg per day and oral doses ranged from 1,000 to 1,500 mg per day. According to the criteria of McCabe and Jackson, 39 cases had nonfatal and 29 had ultimately fatal underlying diseases. The clinical condition of patients at the start of therapy was critical or poor in 40 cases and fair or good in 28. Sixty-four of the 68 episodes of bacteremia were monomicrobial and the remaining four were polymicrobial. The causative micro-organisms were: Escherichia coli (18 episodes), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 episodes), Acinetobacter sp. (10 episodes), Salmonella sp. (seven episodes), Enterobacter sp. (six episodes), Proteus sp. (four episodes), Serratia sp. (four episodes), Haemophilus influenzae (three episodes), Klebsiella sp. (three episodes), Staphylococcus aureus (2 episodes), and Morganella morganii (two episodes). Overall clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin was 94 percent (64 of 68 patients). Bacteremia persisted in four patients (failure rate of 6 percent). Five organisms persisted: Acinetobacter sp. (two patients), P. aeruginosa (one patient), Enterobacter sp. (one patient), and Serratia sp. (one patient). Side effects were phlebitis associated with intravenous administration (four cases), dizziness (four cases), and superinfection (six cases). Superinfecting organisms and sites were as follows: Enterococcus faecalis, wound (2 cases); Candida sp., urinary tract infection (one case); Acinetobacter anitratus (ciprofloxacin resistant), urinary tract infection (one case); Staphylococcus epidermidis, blood (one case); and Clostridium perfringens, blood (one case). Ciprofloxacin administered either intravenously, orally, or intravenously followed by the oral route is effective therapy in the treatment of severe bacteremic infections.
TI  - 3-Sulfonyl-1-carba-1-dethiacephems.
AB  - The stability of the 1-carba-1-dethiacephalosporin framework has allowed the synthesis of a range of 3-sulfonyl-1-carba-1-dethiacephems unavailable for a variety of reasons in the cephem arena. The known p-nitrobenzyl 7 beta-(phenoxyacetamido)-3-[[(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]oxy]-1-carba -1- dethia-3-cephem-4-carboxylate served as a precursor to this series of compounds. Displacement of the enol triflate with various sulfinates in acetonitrile or DMF and deprotection of the intermediates led to 7 beta-[(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)(methoxyimino)acetyl]amino]- 3-[alkyl(aryl)sulfonyl]-1-carba-1-dethia-3-cephem-4-carboxyl ic acids. The 3-sulfonyl-1-carba-1-dethiacephems display potent activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The following MIC's (microgram/mL) for the 3-cyclopropyl sulfone are representative: Staphylococcus aureus = 4, Streptococcus pyogenes = 1, Haemophilus influenzae = 0.25, Escherichia coli = 0.03, Enterobacter cloacae = 0.25, Proteus rettgeri = 0.25. The excellent in vitro antibacterial activity of this series indicates the potential of the carbacephalosporin framework for exploring substituents which are unknown or which produce unstable cephems.
TI  - Ticarcillin/clavulanic acid combination. Treatment of bacterial infections in hospitalized children.
AB  - Eighteen patients 2 months to 11 years of age with culture proven bacterial infections were treated with parenteral ticarcillin/clavulanic acid in a noncomparative study. Seven patients had pneumonia, two had tracheobronchitis, three had soft tissue abscess, two had periorbital cellulitis, three had urinary tract infection and one had purulent bursitis. Four of the 18 were bacteremic. Organisms treated included Staphylococcus aureus (6), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), Haemophilus influenzae (2), Branhamella catarrhalis (2), Escherichia coli (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Streptococcus pyogenes (1) and Serratia marcescens (1). Thirteen of 15 (87%) organisms tested were beta-lactamase positive. Therapy was given intravenously in six doses per day at 310 mg/kg. Duration of treatment ranged from 5 to 28 (mean 11) days, with an average time of 4 days to clinical improvement. Seventeen patients (94%) were clinically cured. One patient with recurrent aspiration pneumonia due to mixed infection with multiple gram-negative enteric bacilli failed therapy. Adverse effects were minimal and transient. Notably, mild to moderate thrombocytosis occurred in four (22%) patients that resolved uneventfully. We conclude that ticarcillin/clavulanic acid is safe and effective therapy for serious infections in hospitalized children.
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1986)].
AB  - Enlisting the help of various research institutions across the nation, Ikemoto et al. have been pooling cultures of clinical isolates of respiratory tract infections and mapping out the correlations between patient backgrounds and the causative bacteria and the changes in the sensitivity spectra of the bacteria to various antibacterial and antibiotic agents annually since 1981. The following is a report of the 1986 findings. During the period from September, 1986 to March, 1987, 558 cases of respiratory infections were reported at 17 institutions across the nation and a total of 657 apparent causative strains were isolated from sputum samples. Of these strains, 75 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 108 of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 150 of Haemophilus influenzae, 107 of Pseudomonas aeruiginosa (non-mucoid production type), 21 of P. aeruginosa (mucoid production type), 32 of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 of Escherichia coli, and 55 of Branhamella catarrhalis were subjected to MIC determination of various antibacterial and antibiotic agents to map drug sensitivities. In addition, diagnoses, age distributions by diagnoses, frequencies of infectious diseases, types of isolated bacteria, and usage statuses of the antibacterial and antibiotic agents the times of at isolation were also investigated. MIC determinations were carried out to investigate susceptibilities of causative organisms of respiratory tract infections to various antibacterial and antibiotic agents. From the 558 cases of respiratory tract infections, 657 strains were detected at concentrations not less than 10(4-6)/ml and identified to be the causative organisms. Of these strains, 603 could be used for MIC determination. An overwhelming majority of major causative bacteria, inclusive of H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae, showed sensitivity patterns similar to the sensitivity patterns found a year earlier, P. aeruginosa alone, however, showed some increase in its susceptibility to penicillin and cephem antibiotics. Regarding patient backgrounds, the age distribution was heavily biased towards the higher end of the scale, which patients with ages of 50 or higher accounting for 77.9%, compared to 73.5% in 1985. When the patients were classified by diagnoses, chronic bronchitis, bacterial pneumonia and bronchiectasis accounted for the majority of the infections: 28.7%, 23.3%, and 19.0%, respectively. The percentages of chronic bronchitis and bacterial pneumonia 28.7% and 23.3%, respectively, were somewhat higher in 1986 than in 1985. The disease which was comparatively frequent in all age groups was bronchiectasis, which accounted for 44.0% in patients with ages 29 years or lower, 18.4% in patients between 30 years and 69 years, and 16.7% in patients with ages 70 years or higher. The next most frequent infection was bacterial pneumonia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Cefoperazone therapy of bacterial meningitis: a clinical trial.
AB  - Sixteen hospitalized patients, aged between 10 and 76 years (mean: 34.3 years), with bacterial meningitis were treated i.v. with cefoperazone at daily doses of 4.5 g to 9 g. In two cases ampicillin was given in combination with cefoperazone during the last four days and the first five days of treatment, respectively. The following organisms were isolated: Neisseria meningitidis (n = 9), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 3), Escherichia coli (n = 2), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 2). Fourteen patients completely recovered from infection and the pathogens were eradicated; the treatment failed in only two patients and both were cured with alternative treatment. Furthermore, in 11 patients cefoperazone serum and CSF levels were determined four times during the first week of treatment (1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th days). No important side effects were recorded.
TI  - [Determination of the MIC of cefotetan against freshly isolated gram-negative bacilli].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities (MICs) of cefotetan (CTT) against 575 strains of 16 spp. of Gram-negative bacilli isolated in 1988 were determined to investigate distribution of MICs in comparison with those of cefmetazole (CMZ), cefoxitin (CFX), latamoxef (LMOX) and cefazolin (CEZ). The change in frequencies of incidence of cephem-resistant strains in the latter half of the 1980 was also investigated. Distribution of MIC of CTT varied with test strains. No or very few MICs were at or higher than 12.5 micrograms/ml at an inoculation of 10(6) cfu/ml, thus rates of CTT-resistant strains were low among Escherichia coli, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., Providencia spp., and Haemophilus influenzae. High rates of resistance to CTT were observed, however, among Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, and Bacteroides fragilis. 2. Most CTT-resistant strains of C. freundii, Enterobacter spp. and S. marcescens were also resistant to LMOX. These resistant strains were considered to be multi-resistant strains to antibiotics including oxime type cephalosporins and monobactams. 3. Cephem-resistant E. coli was confirmed to be resistant to 22% of CEZ, 14% of CFX, 10% of CMZ and 2% of CTT tested. The incidence of cephem-resistant E. coli unconditionally showed an increasing tendency. 4. The incidence of resistant strains against cephamycins including CTT is discussed with regard to the mechanism of resistance against all beta-lactam antibiotics, and the problem of the appearance of resistant strains is close and inseparable from social background.
TI  - Efficacy of clavulanate-potentiated antibiotics against Bacteroides species and artificially associated cultures of aerobes and anaerobes.
AB  - Clavulanic acid is known to potentiate the activity of amoxycillin and ticarcillin against beta-lactamase-producing Bacteroides species. In order to assess the usefulness of the clavulanate antibiotics in mixed infections with aerobes and anaerobes, artificially associated cultures of clinically significant Bacteroides species and facultative anaerobes (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp.) were tested. The minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of amoxycillin and ticarcillin, singly and in combination with clavulanate, were determined for the individual species in the associated culture and for the associated culture as a whole. In the absence of clavulanate, association experiments showed that the MBCs of susceptible strains increased in the presence of beta-lactamase-producing species, whereas the addition of clavulanate to the test systems led to MBCs which were mostly comparable to values as determined in single strain testing.
TI  - Ticarcillin/clavulanate in severe infections in patients with varying renal function.
AB  - The therapeutic efficacy of ticarcillin/clavulanate was assessed in 71 patients with severe infections: 38 acute pyelonephritis, 16 septicaemia and 19 miscellaneous infections. The patients were classified according to their renal function in: Group A, normal (16 cases); B, mild renal impairment (RI) with creatinine clearance (Clcr) between 80 and 40 ml/min (18 cases); C, moderate RI with Clcr between 40 and 15 ml/min (12 cases); D, severe RI with (Clcr) between 15 and 5 ml/min (13 cases) and E, terminal with (Clcr) less than 5 ml/min (12 cases). A total of 105 microorganisms (48.6% resistant to ticarcillin): 31 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18 Escherichia coli, 21 other Enterobacteriaceae, 2 Haemophilus influenzae, 10 Bacteroides spp., 14 enterococci, 8 staphylococci and 1 streptococcus, were isolated. All except six Ps. aeruginosa were sensitive to ticarcillin/clavulanate, using 75:10 microgram discs. Bacteriological eradication was obtained in 97% of the cases on the third day and at the end of treatment, and in 82% of the cases after one month. In all the assessable cases, the clinical symptoms disappeared on the third day except in one patient who developed a resistant strain (Klebsiella oxytoca). The wide range of bacteria assessed and the clinical-bacteriological success rates demonstrated that the ticarcillin/clavulanate combination had an efficacy/safety profile that could be considered excellent. Tolerance was good and side effects were not observed. This study confirms the practical efficacy of the recommended dosages derived from our previous kinetic studies in RI.
TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of Haemophilus influenzae fimbrial genes establishes adherence to oropharyngeal epithelial cells.
AB  - In this report the first example of functional expression of a fimbrial gene cluster of a non-enteric human pathogen in Escherichia coli is described. This is shown for Haemophilus influenzae fimbriae which mediate adherence to oropharyngeal epithelial cells. A genomic library of H.influenzae type b, strain 770235f+bo, was constructed using a cosmid vector and screened with a synthetic oligonucleotide probe derived from the N-terminal sequence of the fimbrial subunit of H.influenzae. Four cosmid clones were found which hybridized to this oligonucleotide probe. Escherichia coli strains harbouring these clones expressed the H.influenzae fimbriae at their cell surface, as was demonstrated in a whole-cell ELISA and by immunogold electron microscopy using a monoclonal antibody specific for the H.influenzae fimbriae. Surface expression could be maintained during subcloning until a minimal H.influenzae DNA insert of approximately 8.1 kb was obtained. Escherichia coli strains harbouring the 8.1 kb H. influenzae DNA were able to cause a mannose-resistant adherence to oropharyngeal epithelial cells and a mannose-resistant haemagglutination of human AnWj-positive erythrocytes. The nucleotide sequence of hifA, the gene encoding the major fimbrial subunit, was determined. The predicted amino acid sequence shows a significant homology with a number of E.coli fimbrial subunits.
TI  - Studies to optimize the in vitro testing of piperacillin combined with tazobactam (YTR 830).
AB  - The combination of piperacillin and the beta-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam (formerly YTR 830) was studied to determine optimal disk concentrations and dilution testing conditions. In addition, the potency of the combination was compared to that of piperacillin alone. The spectrum of piperacillin was greatly expanded by the addition to tazobactam principally against beta-lactamase producing strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Shigella spp., Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Staphylococcus spp. Tazobactam was active alone against Branhamella catarrhalis (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] 50, less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml), gonococci (MIC 50, 0.5-4 micrograms/ml), and N. meningitidis (MIC 50, less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml). Studies with beta-lactamase-producing type strains showed tazobactam to have high affinity for plasmid-mediated enzymes (TEM-1 and 2, SHV-1, HMS-1, and some CARB or OXA types) and not chromosomal beta-lactamases. Piperacillin/tazobactam inhibited 93% of fluoro-quinolone resistant strains at less than or equal to 64/8 micrograms/ml but failed to suppress the growth of 15 strains producing stably depressed cephalosporinases. Comparisons of piperacillin/tazobactam results determined with 100/10-, 100/20-, and 100/30-micrograms disks established the 100/10-micrograms disk as most usable. Among five different MIC combinations the ratio of eight parts piperacillin to one part tazobactam or fixed concentration tests at greater than or equal to 4 micrograms tazobactam/ml were preferred, each producing very low occurrences (less than or equal to 1.6%) of false-resistance or -susceptibility when compared to disk test results. MICs determined by agar and broth microdilution methods were essentially the same. The recommended breakpoints for piperacillin/tazobactam MICs were identical to those now found in the NCCLS susceptibility testing standards with the following exceptions: (1) for tests with H. influenzae and Staphylococcus spp.--susceptible at greater than or equal to 21 mm (MIC less than or equal to 16/2 micrograms/ml) and resistant less than or equal to 20 mm (MIC less or equal to 32/4 micrograms/ml); and (2) all remaining nonspeudomonas isolates would be interpreted by the NCCLS piperacillin enteric bacilli susceptibility criteria. This newer beta-lactamase inhibitor combination appears to be worthy of further in vivo trials guided by these or similar tentative in vitro susceptibility testing parameters.
TI  - A plasmid carrying mucA and mucB genes from pKM101 in Haemophilus influenzae and  Escherichia coli.
AB  - The plasmid pMucAMucB, constructed from the Haemophilus influenzae vector pDM2, and a similar plasmid, constructed from pBR322, increased the survival after UV irradiation of Escherichia coli AB1157 with the umu-36 mutation and also caused UV-induced mutation in the E. coli strain. In H. influenzae, pMucAMucB caused a small but reproducible increase in survival after UV irradiation in wild-type cells and in a rec-1 mutant, but there was no increase in spontaneous mutation in the wild type or in the rec-1 mutant and no UV-induced mutation.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FK482, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin with a C-3 vinyl group. Its activity was compared with those of cephalexin, cefuroxime, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. FK482 inhibited 90% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates at 1 micrograms/ml and 90% of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates at less than or equal to 0.012 micrograms/ml, superior to cephalexin and cefuroxime and similar to cefixime. It did not inhibit oxacillin-resistant S. aureus. FK482 inhibited 90% of Enterococcus faecalis isolates at 8 micrograms/ml. Although 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, and Shigella species isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, FK482 was less active than cefixime against Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Morganella, Serratia, and Providencia species, with MICs for many isolates of greater than 8 micrograms/ml. FK482 inhibited Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations comparable to that of cefixime and superior to those of cephalexin and cfaclor. Bacteroides and Pseudomonas species were resistant. FK482 was not hydrolyzed by the TEM-1 and TEM-2 beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and the Proteus vulgaris enzyme. It had a high affinity for chromosomal beta-lactamases.
TI  - Concentrations of ofloxacin in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of patients without  meningitis receiving the drug intravenously and orally.
AB  - The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration of ofloxacin given orally or or intravenously was studied in cancer patients without meningitis. Each patient was assigned to a different sampling time to assess the relation between time and penetration. Ofloxacin was measured in serum and CSF by high-pressure liquid chromatography and bioassay. In addition, the bactericidal titers were measured in CSF and serum against a set of relevant bacteria. Concentrations measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography and bioassay were well correlated. Peak concentrations in CSF (0.4 to 1 microgram/ml) were observed 2 to 4 h after infusion or oral administration. Peak concentrations in serum were observed just after infusion (2 to 3.5 micrograms/ml) or 1 to 2 h after oral administration (1.7 to 4 micrograms/ml). Measured bactericidal titers were well correlated with the titers expected from the MBC and concentration. High CSF bactericidal titers were observed against Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Escherichia coli, whereas low or no bactericidal titers were obtained against Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - The light-dependent cytotoxicity of benzo[a]pyrene: effect on human erythrocytes, Escherichia coli cells, and Haemophilus influenzae transforming DNA.
AB  - In vitro, the photodynamic compound benzo[a]pyrene (BAP) generates singlet oxygen efficiently when irradiated in organic solvents. It also photogenerates superoxide anion radical in water and can act as a photoreducing agent in the absence of oxygen. In vivo, the hemolysis of human erythrocytes, the inactivation of Escherichia coli cells representing a series of strains differing in excision repair and catalase proficiency, and the inactivation of Haemophilus influenzae transforming DNA activity were used to characterize the phototoxicity of BAP in the presence of near-UV light (290-400 nm). The results are consistent with BAP behaving as a photosensitizer that generates both superoxide and singlet oxygen, and that damages chiefly membranes. DNA does not seem to be a major target in the phototoxic reactions investigated.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the new oral penem ALP-201 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new penem derivative ALP-201 against 226 aerobic and 350 anaerobic clinical bacterial isolates was determined using agar dilution techniques. For comparison amoxicillin, cefaclor, ceftazidime, doxycycline, erythromycin, imipenem and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were also tested with aerobic bacteria, and cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, imipenem, metronidazole and piperacillin with anaerobic bacteria. ALP-201 was found to be highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, Propioni-bacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Clostridium difficile were resistant to ALP-201. When tested against aerobic bacteria using a high inoculum or using the broth dilution technique, the activity of ALP-201 showed little dependence on inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to the inhibitory activity. Further investigations are warranted with ALP-201, which is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the immunoglobulin A1 protease gene (iga) of Haemophilus influenzae serotype b.
AB  - Secretion of immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1) proteases is a characteristic of Haemophilus influenzae and several other bacterial pathogens causing infectious diseases, including meningitis. Indirect evidence suggests that the proteases are important virulence factors. In this study, we cloned the iga gene encoding immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1) protease from H. influenzae serotype b into Escherichia coli, in which the recombinant H. influenzae iga gene was expressed and the resulting protease was secreted. Sequencing a part of a 7.5-kilobase DNA fragment containing the iga gene revealed a large open reading frame with a strongly biased codon usage and having the potential of encoding a protein of 1,541 amino acids and a molecular mass of 169 kilodaltons. Putative promoter and terminator elements flanking the open reading frame were identified. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of this H. influenzae IgA1 protease with that of a similar protease from Neisseria gonorrhoeae revealed several domains with a high degree of homology. Analogous to mechanisms known from the N. gonorrhoeae IgA protease secretion, we propose a scheme of posttranslational modifications of the H. influenzae IgA1 protease precursor, leading to a secreted protease with a molecular mass of 108 kilodaltons, which is close to the 100 kilodaltons reported for the mature IgA1 protease.
TI  - IgA subclasses of human colostral antibodies specific for microbial and food antigens.
AB  - The distribution of total and antigen-specific IgA1 and IgA2 antibodies in human  colostrum was determined by ELISA using subclass-specific monoclonal reagents. In 18 samples of colostrum the mean ratio of total IgA1 to IgA2 was found to be 53:47, respectively, but significant individual variations were observed. In two samples we found unusually low levels of IgA1, while IgA2 was in the normal range. IgA1 and IgA2 antibody activities were determined against the following antigens: bovine gamma-globulin and beta-lactoglobulin, tetanus toxoid, protein antigen I/II of Streptococcus mutans, influenza virus vaccine, polysaccharides of pneumococcal, meningococcal and Haemophilus influenzae type b origin, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli K235. The IgA antibody activity directed against the polysaccharides was almost equally distributed between the two subclasses. However, antibody activity specific for protein antigens was found predominantly in the IgA1 subclass while anti-LPS activity was mostly of the IgA2 subclass.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefteram pivoxil granule in the pediatric field].
AB  - Cefteram pivoxil (CFTM-PI), the pivaloyloxymethyl ester of cefteram (CFTM) in which aminothiazol was also introduced into the 7 position of cephem nucleus, is a new oral cephem antibiotic. CFTM-PI was absorbed through the intestines and hydrolyzed to CFTM by esterases in the intestinal wall and existed in the body fluids as CFTM. A tablet form of this drug has been released in Japan and now a granular form for pediatric patients has been developed. We have determined MICs of 5 drugs (CFTM, cephalexin (CEX), cefaclor (CCL), ampicillin (ABPC), erythromycin (EM], against stock strains and MICs of 6 drugs (CFTM, CEX, CCL, ABPC, methicillin, cloxacillin) against fresh strains from patients received to CFTM-PI, with an inoculum size of 10(6) cfu/ml. A total of 149 strains included Gram-positive cocci i.e. Staphylococcus aureus (11), Streptococcus pyogenes (85), Streptococcus agalactiae (16) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (4), and Gram-negative rods i.e. Haemophilus influenzae (11), Bordetella pertussis (11), Escherichia coli (9), Proteus mirabilis (1) and Morganella morganii (1). The granular form of CFTM-PI was administered to 9 boys (age: 8 years 3 months approximately 10 years 10 months) to determine serum and urinary concentrations of the drug and its urinary recovery rates using bioassay. Doses of 1.5, 3.0 and 6.0 mg/kg were given orally 30 minutes after meal to 3 boys, respectively. Urinary concentrations and its urinary recovery rates of T-2525A, a main metabolite of CFTM, were determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). To study clinical and bacteriological effects of this drug, a mean daily dose of 3.3 mg/kg divided 3-4 times a day (3 times: 133 cases, 4 times: 9 cases) was administered for 8 days on the average to a total of 142 cases with pharyngitis (22), tonsillitis (12), acute bronchitis (3), pneumonia (11), pleurisy (1), scarlet fever (28), acute purulent otitis media (16), impetigo (13), abscess (2), purulent lymphadenitis (1) and urinary tract infection (33). Adverse reactions and abnormal effects on laboratory test values attributable to this drug were studied in patients. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. With regard to Gram-positive cocci, MICs of CFTM against 11 fresh strains of S. aureus ranged from 3.13 to 6.25 micrograms/ml except for 1 strain, thus CFTM was equally effective to CEX, but less active than the other drugs tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical studies of cefteram pivoxil in pediatrics].
AB  - The clinical efficacy and the safety of cefteram pivoxil granule (CFTM-PI, T-2588), a newly prepared drug for pediatric use, were performed. A total of 60 patients with ages between 6 months and 14 years 3 months with pediatric infections were medicated with CFTM-PI at dose levels of 3.2-9.9 mg/kg 3 times daily for 3-11 days. Clinical responses to the drug were excellent in 3 of 3 patients with acute pharyngitis, excellent in 14, good in 5 and poor in 2 of 21 patients with acute purulent tonsillitis, excellent in 1 and good in 2 of 3 patients with acute bronchitis, excellent in 16 and good in 8 of 24 patients with acute pneumonia, excellent in 3 and good in 1 of 4 patients with acute urinary tract infection and excellent in 2 of 2 patients with acute purulent lymphadenitis, hence the overall clinical efficacy rate was 96.5% in a total of 57 patients. Bacteriological responses to the drug were as follows: Eradicated, 8 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 3 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 19 strains of Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive; 7, beta-lactamase negative; 12), 1 strain of Haemophilus parainfluenzae (beta-lactamase positive) and 4 strains of Escherichia coli (beta-lactamase positive; 1, beta-lactamase negative; 3), decreased, 1 strain of S. pyogenes, hence the eradication rate was 97.2%. No side effects were encountered in any of the patients but for 3 who had diarrhoea and 1 who had loose stool, though these changes were slight. As abnormal laboratory test data, elevation of GOT was noted in 1 case, thrombocytosis and elevation of GPT in another. Also, none of the patients refused or complained of difficulty in intaking of the drug via oral route. In conclusion, CFTM-PI appeared to be a safe and highly effective antibiotic against pediatric infections.
TI  - [Clinical studies on cefteram pivoxil granules in pediatrics].
AB  - A newly developed cephalosporin, cefteram pivoxil (CFTM-PI, T-2588), was evaluated clinically in 40 patients. A pharmacokinetic study was also performed with 8 patients. CFTM-PI was administered as granules. One patient was given CFTM-PI at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg, each of 3 patients was given the drug at a dose of 3 mg/kg and each of 4 patients at a dose of 6 mg/kg. In most cases, serum concentrations of CFTM were determined at 2, 3, 4, and 6 hours after dosing. Urinary concentrations of CFTM were measured for urinary samples collected during periods of 0-2, 2-4, 4-6 and 6-8 hours after dosing. CFTM was assayed using the disk or the cup method using Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 10031 as the test organism. The clinical evaluation was conducted in 40 children including 13 patients of acute tonsillitis, 10 of acute lacunar tonsillitis, 10 of scarlet fever, 2 of acute bronchitis, 2 of pneumonia, and 1 each of pneumonia with enteritis, phlegmon and urinary tract infection. The patients were from 4 months to 13 years old. Daily doses were from 8.7 to 12 mg/kg. After CFTM-PI administration in doses 1.5 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg, peak serum concentrations of CFTM were 0.38 microgram/ml, 0.73-2.25 micrograms/ml and 1.2-2.9 micrograms/ml, respectively, and half-lives were 1.55, 0.95-2.30 and 0.80-2.72 hours, respectively. Urinary excretion rates up to 6 or 8 hours after dosing were 10.8-24.7%. Clinical efficacies of CFTM-PI in 40 patients were "excellent" in 27 children, "good" in 12 children and "fair" in 1 with an efficacy rate of 97.5%. Twenty seven strains of causative organisms, including 15 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 1 of Escherichia coli, 1 of Salmonella 04, 6 of Haemophilus influenzae, 1 of Haemophilus parainfluenzae and 3 of Branhamella catarrhalis, were isolated. After treatment all strains except 1 strain of B. catarrhalis (unchanged), Salmonella 04 (unknown) and 1 strain of H. parainfluenzae (unknown) were eradicated. Side effects observed clinically were only 1 case of diarrhea. Eosinophilia was observed in 1 case.
TI  - In-vitro activity of meropenem against clinical isolates obtained in Canada.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, gentamicin and, where appropriate, other antibiotics against recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. MICs were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. Meropenem inhibited 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens and Providencia stuartii at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l and was four- to 16-fold more active than imipenem against these species. Against the enteric pathogens Salmonella typhi, Shigella sonnei, Yersinia enterocolitica and Campylobacter jejuni, meropenem was four- to eight-fold more active than imipenem, inhibiting all isolates at less than or equal to 0.03 mg/l. Meropenem was also more active than imipenem against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) but had similar activity against the Bacteroides fragilis group (MIC90 0.25 mg/l), against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 2 mg/l) and against streptococci. Imipenem was four-fold more active than meropenem against Acinetobacter spp. and two- to eight-fold more active against all species of staphylococci tested. Both meropenem and imipenem were inactive against Ps. (Xanthomonas) maltophilia.
TI  - Treatment of childhood bacterial meningitis.
AB  - One hundred and eighty-seven children with identified bacterial meningitis were treated with intravenous cefotaxime: 15 patients were neonates, 79 infants, and 93 were aged from 1 to 14 years. Causative organisms were: Neisseria meningitidis in 80 cases, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 41, Haemophilus influenzae in 40, enteric gram-negative bacilli in 20 and Staphylococcus spp. in six. Enteric gram-negative bacilli included: Salmonella spp. in 14 cases, Klebsiella pneumoniae in two, and Escherichia coli, Enterobacter sakazakii and Acinobacter calcoaceticus in one each; in one case the organism was not specified. Daily dose of cefotaxime was 150 to 300 mg/kg. Concomitant treatment with an aminoglycoside was used in seven cases. One hundred and seventy-two patients (92.0%) were cured. Fever persisted for a mean of five days and meningeal signs for a mean of four days. Fifteen (8.0%) patients died: most [13] of them were admitted in coma, and two in shock. Death occurred in the first 48 h in ten cases. Sterilization of CSF was achieved in the first 72 h of treatment in 155 (90.1%) of the cured patients. Cefotaxime was well tolerated. CSF penetration of cefotaxime was evaluated in seven patients: concentrations ranged from 0.499 mg/l to 2.829 mg/l. Based on this clinical study, cefotaxime is an effective and safe drug for the treatment of childhood bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Characterization of a multiple antibiotic resistance plasmid from Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - Plasmid pLS88 from a clinical isolate of Haemophilus ducreyi encoded resistance determinants for sulfonamides and streptomycin related to those of RSF1010 and for kanamycin related to Tn903 but lacked the inverted repeats of the transposon. Its host range included Haemophilus influenzae, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, and Escherichia coli; and it was compatible with pDM2 and RSF1010.
TI  - Randomized comparative study of ampicillin/sulbactam vs. ceftriaxone for treatment of soft tissue and skeletal infections in children.
AB  - In a prospective study 105 children hospitalized with soft tissue infection, 11 children with suppurative arthritis and 9 children with osteomyelitis were treated with either parenterally administered ampicillin/sulbactam or ceftriaxone. Treatment was randomized using a computer-generated table in a 2:1 fashion: 84 patients received ampicillin/sulbactam and 41 patients received ceftriaxone. Organisms isolated from wound site or blood cultures included Staphylococcus aureus (33), Streptococcus pyogenes (19), Haemophilus influenzae (9) including 4 beta-lactamase-positive organisms, Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (3) and 9 other organisms. Clinical and bacteriologic response was satisfactory in 100% of the ampicillin/sulbactam-treated patients and in 93% of the ceftriaxone-treated patients. Two patients with S. aureus infections treated with ceftriaxone had a delayed response and required change in therapy to parenterally administered oxacillin. Ampicillin/sulbactam represents a potentially useful single agent for the treatment of cellulitis and bone or joint infections in pediatric patients.
TI  - Circulating immune complexes, antibodies to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and pulmonary status in cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Serum samples from 37 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), whose lungs were colonized by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were tested in a 1 yr prospective study to examine a possible relationship between levels of circulating immune complexes (CIC) and the following parameters: level of specific antibodies to P. aeruginosa; relative importance of P. aeruginosa mucoid and non-mucoid strains isolated from sputum; the forced expiratory volume (FEV1; percentage predicted); the chest X-Ray score (Brasfield system) and the clinical score (Shwachman system). Reactivity of CIC against P. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli antigens were also assayed. We found that the FEV1, the chest X-Ray and the clinical scores were significantly lower in patients with high levels of CIC than in those with normal levels of CIC (p less than 0.001 for each). We also found that the level of IgG antibodies against P. aeruginosa was significantly higher (p less than 0.001) in patients with high levels of CIC than in those with normal levels of CIC. 78% of patients with high levels of CIC had predominantly mucoid P. aeruginosa isolates whereas only 21% of patients with normal levels of CIC had also predominantly mucoid P. aeruginosa isolates. Specific antibodies to P. aeruginosa were detected in all CIC isolated by polyethylene glycol precipitations from CF patients exhibiting both high levels of CIC and inferior pulmonary status. Our findings support the hypothesis that a high level of CIC in association with an aggressive humoral response to P. aeruginosa correlates with defective pulmonary status in cystic fibrosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on cefteram pivoxil in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies on cefteram pivoxil(cefteram) a new cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. Serum concentrations, urinary concentrations and urinary recovery rates of cefteram (CFTM) were determined upon oral administration after meal of cefteram pivoxil (CFTM-PI) at doses of 3 mg/kg granules in 2 cases and 6 mg/kg granules in 2. Peak serum levels of CFTM were obtained at 3 hours in 2 cases and 4 hours in 2 cases after administration of the drug with a range of 0.74-2.2 micrograms/ml with half-lives of 0.77-3.62 hours. Urinary recovery rates in 8 hours after administration ranged from 9.6-23.0%. 2. MICs of CFTM against 22 clinical isolates (Streptococcus pyogenes 4 strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae 4, Staphylococcus aureus 2, Branhamella catarrhalis 1, Haemophilus influenzae 8, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 1, and Escherichia coli 2) were compared with those of cefaclor (CCL), cephalexin (CEX), and ampicillin (ABPC). The antibacterial activity of CFTM was superior to those of CCL and CEX, and was superior against Gram-negative rods and equal against Gram-positive cocci to those of ABPC. 3. Twenty-six pediatric patients with acute infectious diseases (scarlet fever 3 cases, tonsillitis 7, epiglottitis 1, bronchitis 5, pneumonia 5, urinary tract infection 3, cervical lymphadenitis 2) were treated with CFTM-PI at daily doses of 9.3-15.3 mg/kg t.i.d. as a rule. The efficacy rates were 100% clinically and 70% bacteriologically. 4. Side effects or abnormal laboratory test values were not observed except for an increased platelet count in 1 case.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of QA-241, a new tricyclic quinolone derivative.
AB  - The in vitro susceptibilities of 1,310 clinical isolates to QA-241, a novel tricyclic quinolone, were evaluated in comparison with susceptibilities to norfloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, and ciprofloxacin. The MICs of QA-241 for 90% of staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis isolates, and streptococcal species ranged from 1.56 to 6.25 micrograms/ml, and the activity of QA-241 was similar to those of norfloxacin and enoxacin but two to four times less potent than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. At the concentration of less than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml, QA-241 inhibited 90% of Haemophilus influenzae, Bordetella pertussis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and gram-negative enteric bacteria except for Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter freundii. QA-241 was moderately active (MIC for 90% of strains tested, 6.25 to 12.5 micrograms/ml) against S. marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Xanthomonas maltophilia, and Bacteroides fragilis. The antibacterial activity of QA-241 was roughly comparable to that of enoxacin but two to four times less potent than that of ofloxacin. In systemic infections in mice with gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods, the efficacy of QA-241 was generally greater than that of norfloxacin and similar to those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. In urinary tract infections in mice with Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, QA-241 was as active as ofloxacin and more active than norfloxacin but less active than ciprofloxacin. In pulmonary infections in mice with Klebsiella pneumoniae, the effectiveness of QA-241 was similar to that of ofloxacin.
TI  - Demonstration of a functional variant of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase in Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Seven clinical isolates of chloramphenicol-resistant Haemophilus influenzae were  studied. The products of chloramphenicol inactivation by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) were identified by high performance liquid chromatography. The sole product in H. influenzae is a single monoacetyl compound, whereas variants of CAT isolated from other chloramphenicol-resistant bacteria usually produce both monoacetyl and diacetyl chloramphenicol metabolites. The chloramphenicol resistance gene was found to reside on a 65-kb plasmid which, in five of the six cases studied, appeared to be integrated into the host cell chromosome.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of piperacillin-tazobactam and ticarcillin-clavulanate.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ticarcillin, piperacillin, clavulanic acid, tazobactam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, and piperacillin-tazobactam against 819 bacterial isolates were compared. The two beta-lactamase inhibitors, clavulanic acid and tazobactam, had little useful antibacterial activity but enhanced the activities of the penicillins against beta-lactamase-producing strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus; all strains were susceptible to both combinations. Both enzyme inhibitors also enhanced the activities of the penicillins against most strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Citrobacter diversus, Proteus spp., Providencia spp., and Bacteroides spp. and against occasional strains of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., and Serratia marcescens. Clavulanic acid frequently enhanced the activity of ticarcillin against Xanthomonas maltophilia, and tazobactam frequently enhanced the activity of piperacillin against Morganella morganii. Enhancement was observed primarily with strains relatively resistant to the penicillins. In general, clavulanic acid was more effective than tazobactam in enhancing penicillin activity against Klebsiella spp., C. diversus, X. maltophilia, and Bacteroides spp., whereas tazobactam was more effective against Escherichia coli and Proteeae. There was little or no enhancement of activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, or Acinetobacter anitratus. Clavulanic acid occasionally antagonized the activity of ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, but those strains were still considered susceptible to the combination. Tazobactam never antagonized the activity of piperacillin. In a direct comparison of the activities of ticarcillin-clavulanate and piperacillin-tazobactam, the two were equally active against H. influenzae, B. catarrhalis, and S. aureus; the latter was more active against E. faecalis. For relatively susceptible strains of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, neither combination was predictably more active than the other, but relatively resistant strains were generally more susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. Piperacillin-tazobactam was more active than ticarcillin-clavulanate against A. hydrophila, P. aeruginosa, and P. cepacia, similar in activity against A. anitratus, and less active against X. maltophilia and Bacteroides spp.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and expression of the gene for the site-specific integration  protein from bacteriophage HP1 of Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the leftmost 2,363 base pairs of the HP1 genome, which includes the attachment site (attP) and the integration region, was determined. This sequence contained an open reading frame encoding a 337-residue polypeptide, which is a member of the integrase family of site-specific recombination proteins as judged by sequence comparison. The open reading frame was located immediately adjacent to the att site and was oriented so that initiation of translation would begin distal to the att site and end in its immediate vicinity. Expression of this DNA segment in Escherichia coli provided extracts which promoted site-specific recombination between plasmids containing cloned HP1 attP and Haemophilus influenzae attB sites. This recombination was directional, since no reaction was observed between plasmids containing attR and attL sites. The reaction was stimulated by the accessory protein integration host factor of E. coli. Evidence was also obtained that the integration host factor influenced the levels of HP1 integrase expression. The deduced amino acid sequence of HP1 integrase has remarkable similarity to that deduced for the integrase of coliphage 186.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR, CS-807), a newly developed oral cephem, were carried out in the treatment of infectious diseases in the field of pediatrics. 1. Since CPDX demonstrates very powerful antimicrobial actions against such Gram-negative bacilli as Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia sp., such Gram-positive cocci as Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-lactamase producing Branhamella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae, this drug was thought to be useful for the treatment of pediatric infectious diseases when main causative bacteria in the field of pediatrics were taken into account. 2. When changes in blood and urine concentrations of CPDX following the administration of this drug at 3.7 mg/kg before meal were determined, Cmax and T1/2 were found to be 2.98 micrograms/ml at 2-hour and 1.73 hours, respectively; an urinary excretion rate in the first 6 hours and a maximum urine concentration were 32.5% and 52 micrograms/ml, respectively. 3. Clinically, 8 of 8 patients with the upper respiratory tract infections (100%), 28 of 29 patients with bronchitis and/or pneumonia (96.6%), 3 of 4 patients with otitis media (75%), 2 of 2 patients with sinusitis (100%), 3 of 3 patients with the skin soft tissue infections (100%), 1 of 1 patient with bacterial enteritis (100%) and 11 of 14 patients with urinary tract infections (78.6%) responded well to the treatment with CPDX-PR, showing a 91.8% efficacy rate in all the patients treated. 4. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, B. catarrhalis, H. influenzae, E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium were all eradicated from 5, 1, 4, 6, 1, 5, 5, 11 and 1 patient, respectively. An eradication rate in all the patients examined was 97.5% (39/40). 5. Gastrointestinal symptoms appeared as side effects in 2 of 71 patients (vomiting in 1 and diarrhea in 1), hence, an incidence of side effects was 2.8% (2/71). As for abnormal laboratory findings, eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and increases in GOT and GPT were observed in 3 of 39 patients examined (7.7%), 1 of 39 patients (2.6%) and 2 of 34 patients (5.9%), respectively. In addition, we also examined the effect of the drug on the hemostatic system, but found no changes upon the treatment. Based on these results, it appeared that CPDX-PR was a useful and safe drug in treatment of infectious diseases in the field of pediatrics when administered 2-3 times a day at a dose of 3-6 mg/kg.
TI  - Intravenous sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of pediatric infections.
AB  - A total of 82 patients involving 83 episodes of proven or presumed bacterial infection were treated with sulbactam/ampicillin. These included 36 cases of soft tissue infection or abscess, four cases of joint or bone infection, 20 cases of respiratory tract infection (17 cases of pneumonia, two of otitis media, and one of tonsillitis), 15 urinary tract infections, three cases of enterocolitis, one case of infective endocarditis, two cases of septicemia, and two of peritonitis. The causative pathogen was isolated in 48 cases (49 infections). These pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus 13 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis one, Streptococcus pyogenes two, Streptococcus pneumoniae two, Viridans group streptococcus two, peptostreptococcus one, Haemophilus influenzae one, Escherichia coli 12, Enterobacter cloacae three, Proteus mirabilis one, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus one, Salmonella spp. two, Shigella sonnei one, Bacteroides fragilis one, and polymicrobial infections of various combinations in five cases. No bacterial pathogens were isolated in 34 infections, 14 cases of pneumonia and 15 soft tissue infections. Sulbactam/ampicillin was given by intravenous bolus in a dosage range of 75-450 mg/kg/day in four divided doses for variable periods of time depending on the type and severity of the infection. Of a total of 83 episodes of infections, 80 (96.4%) cases were either cured or improved. Bacteriologic eradication also occurred in 46 (93.9%) of 49 infections. Side effects were diarrhea in two patients, acute hemolytic anemia in one patient, and transient elevations in SGOT and leukopenia in one patient. Side effects disappeared upon completion of treatment. Sulbactam/ampicillin is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of common pediatric infections.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil dry syrup in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR, CS-807) is a new oral cephem derivative drug in which carboxylic acid was esterified to the 4-position of CPDX (oxime type cephem antibiotic). CPDX-PR is hydrolyzed mainly with esterase in intestinal wall and CPDX exists as an active form in body fluid. While there are numerous study reports using CPDX-PR in tablet forms in Japan, the dry syrup formula for pediatric use was newly developed. The dry syrup of CPDX-PR was orally administered 20 minutes after meal to the 6 boys of ages from 8 years and 1 month to 10 years and 10 months, with doses of 3 and 6 mg/kg, respectively, for 3 cases each. Serum concentrations and urinary concentrations and recovery rate of the drug were investigated. In addition to the above, the clinical and bacteriological studies were performed in a total of 105 cases consisting of children with ages ranging from 2 months to 11 years and 8 months, upon administering an average dose of 3.4 mg/kg, 3 to 4 times per day (96 cases of 3 times and 9 cases of 4 times). The 105 cases included 13 cases of pharyngitis, 21 cases of tonsillitis, 4 cases of acute bronchitis, 6 cases of pneumonia, 1 case of pleurisy, 13 cases of scarlet fever, 41 cases of urinary tract infection, 3 cases of posthitis and 3 cases of bacillary dysentery. Drug sensitivity test was performed for the following strains: (i) Strains retained by our department; 52 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 18 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, and 11 strains of Bordetella pertussis, and (ii) strains isolated from cases to which CPDX-PR was administered; 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 8 strains of S. pyogenes, 2 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 10 strains of Escherichia coli, and 1 strain of Proteus mirabilis. Drug sensitivities of the strains retained by our department were tested with the inoculum sizes of 10(8) and 10(6) cfu/ml for R-3746 (Na-salt of CPDX), cefaclor (CCL), cephalexin (CEX), amoxicillin (AMPC), and methicillin (DMPPC), and those against strains separated from the cases to which CPDX-PR was administered were tested with the same inoculum sizes for R-3746, CCL, CEX, cefadroxil, ampicillin (ABPC), DMPPC and cloxacillin (MCIPC). Adverse reactions and abnormal clinical laboratory test results were also examined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of a new quinolone, AM-1091.
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new quinolone, AM-1091 [7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-8-chloro-1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro- 4-oxo- 3-quinoline carboxylic acid hydrochloride], was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, beta-lactams, and gentamicin. AM-1091 inhibited 90% of the isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml. For many species AM-1091 was 2-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and 2- to 32-fold more active than ofloxacin. It inhibited Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Klebsiella species resistant to ceftazidime and gentamicin. Ninety percent of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, so for this species AM-1091 was twofold less active than ciprofloxacin. AM-1091 was more active against Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia, inhibiting isolates resistant to imipenem and gentamicin. Most Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Branhamella catarrhalis isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml. The MICs for 90% of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecalis isolates were 0.06, 0.06, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. AM-1091 inhibited hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.25 micrograms/ml and was more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against gram-positive species. AM-1091 inhibited 90% of the Bacteroides species at 0.5 micrograms/ml. The frequency of spontaneous resistance was less than 10(-10) for most organisms, but resistant strains could be selected by repeated subculturing. Although AM-1091 had lower in vitro activity at pH 5.5 and in the presence of high concentrations of Mg2+, it still inhibited most organisms at </= 0.5 micrograms/ml under these conditions. AM-1091 rapidly killed Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa and had a prolonged postantibiotic suppressive effect on these bacteria.
TI  - Penetration of newer cephalosporins into cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - A review of the world literature on the penetration (ratio of concentrations of cerebrospinal fluid to concentrations of serum) and attainable antibiotic concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid in humans for cefuroxime, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefmenoxime, cefamandole, cefoperazone, moxalactam, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone indicates that, with the exceptions of cefamandole and cefoperazone, all agents appear equivalent. We conclude that the choice of cephalosporin for the treatment of acute bacterial meningitis should depend mainly on the potency of the agent for the specific meningeal pathogens in question. For the treatment of common meningeal pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis) and for gram-negative bacilli, mainly Escherichia coli and Klebsiella (excluding Pseudomonas aeruginosa), the cefotaxime-ceftriaxone group of cephalosporins has accrued the most clinical experience and the most pharmacokinetic data, while for P. aeruginosa the major interest has centered on ceftazidime.
TI  - In vitro activity of sulbactam in combination with various beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - Forty-three strains (beta-lactamase positive and negative) from the species of Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumanii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied for synergy between sulbactam and several beta-lactam antibiotics. Using a checkerboard method, synergy was observed with 10 to 55% of the beta-lactamase negative strains. Synergy was more frequent with the strains producing beta-lactamase. Using the killing curve method, synergy was also observed between sulbactam and beta-lactam antibiotics against some beta-lactamase negative strains. In addition, the regrowth of a resistant subpopulation was prevented by sulbactam.
TI  - [Clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil dry syrup in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR, CS-807) dry syrup was administered orally to 31 patients with various infections at daily dose levels between 5.4 and 10.9 mg/kg divided into three doses. 1. The subjects were 3 patients with urinary tract infections, 25 with tonsillitis and 1 patient each with bronchitis, pneumonia, and cervical lymphadenitis. Clinical effects were excellent in 16 cases, good in 14, and fair in 1 (tonsillitis), with an overall efficacy rate of 96.8%. 2. Organisms suspected as pathogens were 32 strains (6 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 of Streptococcus pyogenes, 1 of Enterococcus faecalis, 15 of Haemophilus influenzae, 5 of Haemophilus parainfluenzae and 3 of Escherichia coli). Bacteriologically, eradication of pathogens were observed in 30 strains, decrease in one (H. parainfluenzae), and no change in another (E. faecalis), thus the eradication rate was 93.8%. 3. Side effect was observed in 1 case (slight eruption) but it was possible continue the treatment. Abnormal laboratory test values were observed in 1 case of a slight prolongation of prothrombin time and eosinophilia, but they were not serious. Diarrhea was not observed in any patients. 4. All the medication was done on schedule. No refusal of the drug occurred due to its taste or odor.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil in the pediatric field].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR, CS-807), a new oral cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Antibacterial activities of R-3746 (Na-salt of cefpodoxime (CPDX] against clinically isolated strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Haemophilus influenzae were compared with those of cefaclor, cephalexin and cefadroxil. R-3746 is superior to other antibiotics against S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, B. catarrhalis and Gram-negative rods. 2. Serum concentrations of CPDX after administration of CPDX-PR at doses of 3 mg/kg (fasting), 6 mg/kg (non-fasting) and 6 mg/kg (fasting) were determined. Mean AUC (area under curve)'s of CPDX obtained were 9.60, 31.35 and 17.89 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively for the 3 dosages. The mean half-lives of CPDX were 3.35, 1.88 and 1.76 hours, respectively. The mean urinary recovery rate within 8 hours after administration of CPDX-PR at a dose of 3 mg/kg (fasting) was 39.2%. 3. CPDX-PR was administered to 37 pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (pyelonephritis 9, cystitis 4, pneumonia 7, acute bronchitis 3, otitis media 2, tonsillitis 10, subcutaneous abscess 1 and purulent lymphadenitis 1). The overall clinical efficacy rate was 91.9% and the overall bacteriological eradication rate was also 91.9%. 4. No adverse reactions were observed. Abnormal laboratory findings were moderate, eosinophilia in 2 and slight elevation of GOT and GPT in 1. The taste and the odor of the CPDX-PR preparation was sufficiently tolerable. From the above results we have concluded that CPDX-PR is a useful oral antibiotic in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - Transposon mutagenesis, characterization, and cloning of transformation genes of  Haemophilus influenzae Rd.
AB  - A plasmid library of PstI fragments of Haemophilus influenzae Rd genomic DNA was  mutagenized in Escherichia coli with mini-Tn10kan. The mutagenized PstI fragments were introduced by transformation into the H. influenzae chromosome, and kanamycin-resistant transformants were screened for the transformation-deficient phenotype by a cyclic AMP-DNA plate method. Fifty-four mutant strains containing 24 unique insertions that mapped to 10 different PstI fragments were isolated. Strains carrying unique insertions were tested individually for DNA uptake, transformation efficiency, UV sensitivity, and growth rate. The transformation frequencies of these mutants were decreased by factors of 10(-2) to 10(-6). Five of the mutants had normal competence-induced DNA uptake, and the rest were variably deficient in competence development. Three strains were moderately UV sensitive. All strains but one had doubling times within 50% of that of the wild type. Mutated genes were cloned into an H. influenzae-E. coli shuttle vector, and wild-type loci were recovered by in vivo recombinational exchange. Hybridization of these clones to SmaI genomic fragments separated in pulsed-field gels showed that these insertions were not clustered in a particular region of the chromosome.
TI  - Clonal characterization of the human IgG antibody repertoire to Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide. II. IgG antibodies contain VH genes from a single VH family and VL genes from at least four VL families.
AB  - To define the V gene family repertoire of human IgG anti-Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide antibodies, we purified six IgG1 and nine IgG2 anti-Hib-PS antibodies to monoclonality from immune serum of six individuals and performed N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. Of the 15 clonal antibodies we examined, all H chain V regions were of the VHIII family. In contrast, the L chains of these antibodies were clearly from at least four different VL families; VKI, VKII, VKIII, and V lambda. Interestingly. VL family expression correlated with the cross-reactivity of these antibodies to the capsular carbohydrate of Escherichia coli K100. VKII antibodies did not cross-react, whereas antibodies expressing V lambda, VKI, or VKIII generally cross-reacted. We conclude that L chain V regions are very important contributors to the limited heterogeneity in this antibody repertoire.
TI  - [Meningitis as cause of prelingual deafness].
AB  - In an examination of 624 prelingual deaf children in the Christian Institute for  deaf children 'Effatha' in Voorburg special attention was paid to deafness caused by meningitis. This diagnosis was made in 70 persons. In 41 of these the pathogen of meningitis could be traced. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the main causative organism of meningitis and subsequent deafness (60%). Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and Neisseria meningitidis follow with 12, 9 and 7% respectively. We emphasize the timely audiologic control of all children who suffered a meningitis.
TI  - [Clinical and pharmacokinetic evaluation of cefodizime in children].
AB  - Cefodizime (CDZM, THR-221), a new cephem antibiotic, was investigated for its clinical efficacy and pharmacokinetics in children. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Antimicrobial activities Antimicrobial activities of CDZM against clinically isolated organisms were determined. MICs of CDZM against 1 strain each of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were 0.05 micrograms/ml to 0.10 micrograms/ml. Especially, MIC against all 6 strains of Haemophilus influenzae was less than or equal to 0.024 micrograms/ml. This MIC value was lower than those of other antibiotics such as cefotaxime, cefotiam, cefazolin, piperacillin. 2. Pharmacokinetics CDZM was given to 1 case at a dose of 20 mg/kg by a 60-minute intravenous drip infusion. The peak value of serum concentration of CDZM was 207.80 micrograms/ml at the end of the infusion. The half-life was 2.15 hours. The mean urinary excretion rate was 68.5% in the first 4 hours, 79.2% in 6 hours and 76.5% in 8 hours after the 30-minute drip infusion. 3. Clinical efficacy CDZM was given to a total of 27 patients, 13 with pneumonia, 1 with bronchitis, 2 with acute pharyngitis, 1 with purulent tonsillitis, 5 with urinary tract infection, 1 each with retrograde cholangitis, acute enteritis, pericementitis, phlegmon and inguinal lymphadenitis. Overall clinical efficacies were excellent in 5 cases, good in 17 and the efficacy rate was 81%. Bacteriological effects were investigated in 13 cases and the eradication rate was 85%. No adverse reactions were observed in any case. As abnormal laboratory findings, elevated GOT, GPT, A1-P, LAP and gamma-GTP, were noted in 1 out of the 28 cases examined.
TI  - [Clinical and pharmacokinetic study on cefodizime, a new cephalosporin antibiotic, in the pediatric infections].
AB  - Cefodizime (THR-221, CDZM), a new cephalosporin antibiotic, was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in 27 children with various bacterial infections. The episodes of infections included pneumonia (6 cases), bronchopneumonia (11 cases), lung abscess (1 case), acute pharyngitis (2 cases), cervical lymphadenitis (1 case), infected cephalohematoma (1 case), urinary tract infection (1 case), sepsis (2 cases) and purulent meningitis (2 cases). CDZM was effective in all but one, and its efficacy rate was 96.3%. The main etiologic pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii and Branhamella catarrhalis. The elimination rate was 92.3%. As adverse reactions or abnormalities, diarrhea was encountered in 4 cases. A slight elevation of serum transaminases or eosinophils was observed in 4 cases. The serum half-life was approximately 1.8-1.9 hours in children after intravenous bolus injections. Concentrations of CDZM in cerebrospinal fluids were well above MIC values of CDZM against those organisms responsible for the infections. The data suggest that CDZM is a safe and effective antibiotic when used in children with bacterial infections including purulent meningitis.
TI  - In vitro activity of YTR 830.
AB  - YTR 830, now known as tazobactam, is a new penicillanic acid sulfone beta-lactamase inhibitor. The in vitro activity of YTR 830 combined with various penicillins was determined and compared to that of clavulanate and sulbactam combined with the same agents. Combined with ampicillin or amoxicillin, all three inhibitors were active against beta-lactamase producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella, Citrobacter diversus, and all anaerobes except for Bacteroides fragilis homology group II. YTR 830 was also effective against Escherichia coli and indole-positive Proteus. The inhibitors had no effect against Enterobacter or Serratia. Overall, the activity of YTR 830 was comparable to that of clavulanate, and superior to that of sulbactam.
TI  - Quality control parameters and interpretive criteria for in vitro susceptibility  tests with the macrolide azithromycin. Collaborative Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing Group.
AB  - Quality control parameters for broth microdilution and disk diffusion susceptibility tests were defined and the interpretive criteria for disk diffusion tests reviewed. For interpretation of tests with 15 micrograms azithromycin disks, the following criteria are recommended: greater than or equal to 19 mm for the susceptible category (MIC less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml) and less than or equal to 15 mm for the resistant category (MIC greater than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml). Using these criteria, there was 97% overall agreement between broth dilution and disk diffusion tests; Haemophilus influenzae isolates were susceptible to azithromycin by both methods. The quality control strain Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 gave zones of 21 to 26 mm in diameter in a six-laboratory collaborative study. In azithromycin broth microdilution tests the following MIC control limits are recommended: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, 2.0-8.0 micrograms/ml; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, 0.25-1.0 micrograms/ml; and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, 1.0-4.0 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Intervertebral disc space infection and osteomyelitis due to Hemophilus species:  report of two cases and review.
AB  - Vertebral osteomyelitis and intervertebral disk space infections in adults are most often caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli. Despite an increasing number of cases caused by other gram-negative bacteria, documented spinal infections with Hemophilus species remain exceedingly rare. All prior cases have involved the lumbar spine between the L2 and L4 levels. None has required surgical decompression or stabilization. We report two adult patients with intervertebral disk space infections and osteomyelitis outside the lumbar region. One patient, who had a Hemophilus influenzae infection of the T9-T10 disk space, was successfully treated with intravenous antibiotics and external bracing. Another patient, who had a Hemophilus aphrophilus infection that destroyed the C5-C6 disk space and adjacent vertebral bodies, required surgical debridement and stabilization in addition to antibiotic therapy and halovest immobilization. Neither patient had a significant underlying illness or extra-spinal source of infection. The clinical features and spinal levels affected in these two patients have expanded our knowledge of the spectrum of disease caused by Hemophilus species.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinical isolates to aztreonam].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activities of 9 antibiotics including aztreonam (AZT) against clinically isolated Gram-negative bacteria were determined using MIC-2000 plus system. Bacteria were isolated from clinical materials in Saga Medical School during a period from May 1987 to March 1988. Summarized results were as follows: 1. AZT showed excellent antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus sp. and Haemophilus influenzae, and MIC80 values of AZT against these organisms were lower than 0.20 microgram/ml. 2. Antibacterial activities of AZT were superior to cephem antibiotics compared against Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens. 3. The MIC50 and MIC80 of AZT against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 12.5 micrograms/ml and 25 micrograms/ml, respectively. 4. AZT did not show any antibacterial activity against Acinetobacter sp. and Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of a new fluorinated 4-quinolone, QA-241.
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new quinolone, QA-241, 9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-5-methyl-8(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl) -1,7-dioxo-1 H,5H-benzo[ii]quinolizine-2-carboxylic hydrochloride, was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, ceftazidime, imipenem, and gentamicin. QA-241 inhibited 90% of isolates of Enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. It was two-fold and four- to 16-fold less active than ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. QA-241 was less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas species than ciprofloxacin. Most Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.03 microgram/ml. The MIC for 90% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, was 1 microgram/ml, as was that for S. epidermidis. For streptococci, including Streptococcus faecalis, the MIC90 was 4 micrograms/ml. QA-241 had minimal activity against anaerobic species. The frequency of spontaneous resistance was less than 10(-9) for members of the Enterobacteriaceae. However, resistant strains could be isolated by repeated subculture. Similar to other quinolones, its activity was less at an acid pH and in the presence of high Mg2+ concentrations. QA-241 showed a good postantibiotic suppressive effect on Escherichia coli.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of cefteram comparison with other oral antibiotics].
AB  - Antimicrobacterial activities of cefteram (CFTM) against clinical isolates collected in 1988 were compared with those of new beta-lactams. 1. Antibacterial activities of CFTM against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis isolated from acute respiratory tract infections were 8- to 16-fold higher than those of cefaclor (CCL). 2. Activities of cefixime (CFIX) were superior to those of CFTM against B. catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, but were inferior to CFTM against S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Staphylococcus aureus. 3. Activities of cefuroxime were superior to those of CCL against each of the 4 tested bacterial species from acute respiratory tract infection and S. aureus by 4-fold, but were inferior to CFTM and CFIX against most of Gram-negative rods. 4. Sultamicillin (SBTPC) is considered to have an activity to inhibit beta-lactamase, but its MICs did not exceed the MICs of ampicillin by itself. SBTPC showed poor antibacterial activities against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Considering these observations, it is apparent that we are faced with a variety of factors in selecting antibiotics for best results.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on imipenem/cilastatin sodium in neonates].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) were performed in neonates. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Plasma levels and urinary excretion of IPM and CS sodium were determined in 7 neonates with ages between 7 and 26 days (gestation periods were 37 to 41 weeks and birth weights were 2,410 to 3,890 g) upon 1 hour drip intravenous infusion of IPM/CS at 10 mg/10 mg/kg, or 20 mg/20 mg/kg. Mean plasma concentrations of IPM reached their peaks at the end of infusion with levels of 12.7 +/- 3.0 micrograms/ml for the group given 10 mg/10 mg/kg, and 19.1 +/- 4.1 micrograms/ml for 20 mg/20 mg/kg. The concentration of IPM in plasma showed a dose-response to the 10 mg/10 mg/kg and 20 mg/20 mg/kg dosages. Concentrations decreased with half-lives of 1.87 +/- 0.71 hours and 1.97 +/- 0.21 hours for the low and the high dosages, and plasma levels at 8 hours after administration were 0.3 +/- 0.1 microgram/ml and 0.8 +/- 0.3 microgram/ml, respectively. Mean urinary recovery rates in 8 hours after administration were 37.6 +/- 11.8% and 26.8 +/- 17.2% for the low and the high dosages. While, mean plasma concentrations and mean urinary recovery rates of CS were higher than those of IPM, mean plasma half-lives of CS were similar to IPM. 2. IPM/CS was administered to 11 neonatal patients (with ages between 1 and 26 days) of various bacterial infections, and clinical effectiveness, bacteriological efficacy and adverse reactions were evaluated. Clinical efficacies in cases including 7 with acute pneumonia and 1 each with suspected septicemia, intrauterine infection, acute urinary tract infection and periproctal abscess were judged excellent in 10 and good in 1 case, and the efficacy rate was 100%. Causative organisms isolated from these patients included 3 strains of Escherichia coli and 1 strain each of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae Enterococcus faecalis and Haemophilus influenzae. All the organisms were eradicated by IPM/CS, thus the bacteriological eradication rate was 100%. No adverse reactions were observed, but decreased platelet in 1 patient and increased GOT in 2 patients were found as abnormal laboratory test values. These changes, however were transient, and returned to normal after discontinuation of IPM/CS. It was concluded that the clinical results of IPM/CS are indicative of excellent efficacy, safety and usefulness of the drug in the treatment of infections in neonates.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - Activities and sources of beta-lactamase in sputum from patients with bronchiectasis.
AB  - beta-Lactamase activity was measured in secretions from patients with bronchiectasis. Of 28 sputum samples, 23 contained measurable amounts of activity; values were significantly higher (P less than 0.01) in purulent samples than in mucoid or mucopurulent samples. beta-Lactamase activity was usually present in saliva collected before and between sputum expectorations, although values for sputum were higher than for either group of saliva samples (P less than 0.025 and P less than 0.005, respectively). This difference suggests that at least part of sputum beta-lactamase activity originates in the bronchial tree. Detailed microbiological study of a further eight specimens (seven were beta-lactamase positive) led to the isolation of Haemophilus influenzae from six, although only two of these isolates were beta-lactamase positive. Several other beta-lactamase-producing organisms were also isolated, including Staphylococcus aureus (n = 3), Escherichia coli (n = 1), Proteus spp. (n = 1), and Bacteroides spp. (n = 3). Size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography of the sputum showed several peaks of beta-lactamase activity which usually coeluted in fractions similar to those of their beta-lactamase-positive isolates. Therefore, sources of sputum beta-lactamases are often bacteria not considered truly pathogenic or not isolated during routine bacteriological assessment. These observations should be considered when embarking on antimicrobial therapy in bronchiectatic patients and suggest that increased dosages of penicillins are indicated.
TI  - Amplification of DNA at a prophage attachment site in Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The Escherichia coli plasmids pBR322 and pBR327 can be taken up by Haemophilus influenzae but do not replicate in this organism; however, integration of pBR into the H. influenzae chromosome was achieved by ligation to a fragment of the Haemophilus phage S2 that carried a phage attachment site (attP). Once these sequences were integrated, they could serve as sites of recombination and amplification for homologous (pBR or phage) DNA. Amplification appeared to occur in one of two prophage sites (attB) present in the H. influenzae chromosome. The extent of amplification was different in different cells and reflected the ability of these sequences to undergo rearrangement leading to the formation of a DNA ladder. The ladder was obtained by treatment of DNA with restriction enzymes that cut outside of the inserted DNA, i.e., did not cut in the repeat sequence, and represented different numbers of repeat elements. Reversed-field gel electrophoresis was instrumental in resolving amplified structures. Inasmuch as single-cell isolates gave rise to the same ladder structure, it was assumed that amplification was under regulatory control and that it reproduced the same equilibrium of repeat structures. Transformation of E. coli with the amplified H. influenzae DNA resulted in precise excision and replication of the original monomeric plasmids. This excision was independent of the recA and recBC genes.
TI  - Review of the in-vitro spectrum and characteristics of cefmetazole (CS-1170).
AB  - The in-vitro antimicrobial qualities of cefmetazole are summarized from a review  of over 30 publications. Cefmetazole, a 7 alpha-methoxy cephalosporin, is shown to have an antimicrobial spectrum closely resembling cefoxitin's. However, cefmetazole is approximately two- to eight-fold more active than cefoxitin against commonly isolated species such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, pyogenic streptococci, pneumococci, and Haemophilus influenzae. Cefmetazole is also active against anaerobic pathogens, Neisseria spp., Citrobacter diversus, indole-positive Proteus spp. and Branhamella catarrhalis. Cefmetazole is bactericidal against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens. Its MICs and MBCs are minimally influenced by high inoculum concentrations. beta-Lactamases failed to hydrolyze cefmetazole significantly and cefmetazole is considered the most stable of the cephamycin drugs. Some Bacteroides strains produce beta-lactamases that are uniquely inhibited by cefmetazole. In-vitro tests with cefmetazole have been evaluated and interpretive criteria established for NCCLS methods: susceptible greater than or equal to 18 mm (less than or equal to 8.0 mg/l) and resistant less than or equal to 14 mm (greater than or equal to 32 mg/l). The consistent cross-resistance and -susceptibility observed between cefmetazole and cefoxitin requires the testing of only one of these agents routinely. Quality control guidelines for cefmetazole disc diffusion (30 micrograms disc) and dilution tests are summarized in this review.
TI  - Primary structure of the porin protein of Haemophilus influenzae type b determined by nucleotide sequence analysis.
AB  - Sequencing techniques for single- and double-stranded DNA were used to determine  the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding P2, the major outer membrane (porin) protein of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). The open reading frame encoding the P2 protein comprised 361 amino acid codons. Comparison of the inferred amino acid sequence with data obtained by amino acid sequencing of the N terminus of the mature or fully processed P2 protein revealed that this protein has a signal peptide composed of 20 amino acids. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of tryptic peptides derived from purified P2 allowed direct identification of 158 of the 341 amino acids in the fully processed P2 protein; there was 100% correlation between these amino acid sequences and that inferred from the nucleotide sequence. The amino acid sequence of Hib P2 protein had 23 to 25% homology with the sequence of the OmpF porin of Escherichia coli and with that of the Neisseria gonorrhoeae porin P.IA. Codon usage in the Hib P2 gene was significantly different from that observed for a gene encoding a porin of E. coli. DNA hybridization studies indicated that there is a single copy of the P2 gene in the Hib chromosome. The availability of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences for the Hib P2 protein will facilitate investigation of the antigenic characteristics and structure-function relationship of this porin.
TI  - Opsonic activity of a new intravenous immunoglobulin preparation: Pentaglobin compared with sandoglobulin.
AB  - Standard preparations of immunoglobulin for intravenous use consist predominantly of IgG (greater than 95%). We have compared the ability of a standard preparation (Sandoglobulin) with that of a new preparation (Pentaglobin, containing 12% IgM and 12% IgA) to improve the opsonic activity of antibody-deficient human sera in vitro. Panhypogammaglobulinaemic sera were poorly opsonic for five of six organisms tested, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pneumoniae, but opsonized Staphylococcus aureus almost normally. Both immunoglobulin preparations significantly improved the opsonic activity of the antibody-deficient sera for most organisms. The major difference between the two preparations was the ability of Pentaglobin to supply opsonins for P. aeruginosa, E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, while Sandogloblin was significantly more potent in opsonins for Haemophilus influenzae. Pentaglobin demonstrates significant in vitro opsonic activity, particularly for enterobacteria (coliforms) and P. aeruginosa. Its content of IgM antibodies appears to confer special properties on Pentaglobin not seen with standard preparations of immunoglobulin for intravenous use. Its place in clinical practice remains to be determined but it may have a possible role in augmenting host defence mechanisms in Gram-negative septicaemia.
TI  - Coumamidines, new broad spectrum antibiotics of the cinodine type. III. Microbiologic activity of coumamidine gamma 1.
AB  - The coumamidines are novel antibiotics with activity against a wide spectrum of aerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. All microbiological studies were performed on coumamidine gamma 1. The MIC90s (micrograms/ml) of coumamidine are as follows: Staphylococcus aureus 1.0, Streptococcus pyogenes 8, Enterobacteriaceae 2.0, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 8, Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli 1, Legionella pneumophila 8, Haemophilus influenzae 0.5, Neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.5. Coumamidine had MICs ranging from 8 to greater 0.5, Neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.5. Coumamidine had MICs ranging from 8 to greater than 64 for most anaerobes, except some Peptostreptococcus strains. The aminoglycoside super-sensitive strain, P. aeruginosa BMH 10, was also super-sensitive to coumamidine (MIC 0.2 micrograms/ml). Coumamidine was rapidly bactericidal for S. aureus. The viable bacterial count in logarithmic phase cultures was reduced to less than 10 cfu within 2 hours after exposure to 4 times the MIC (3.12 micrograms/ml) of coumamidine. The frequency of resistance development was less than 1 X 10(-9) for Escherichia coli and S. aureus when selected at 4 and 8 times the MIC. The Cmax in mouse serum after a single subcutaneous dose of 25 mg/kg of coumamidine was 4.5 micrograms/ml and t1/2 was 1 hour. Coumamidine is stable in serum. In mouse protection tests against S. aureus NCTC 10649 the ED50 was less than 0.6 mg/kg/day when it was administered subcutaneously at 1 and 5 hours after infection. Coumamidine was not absorbed after oral administration. The antibacterial spectrum, bactericidal activity, stability in serum and low frequency of resistance make this an interesting new class of antibiotics.
TI  - Clonal characterization of the human IgG antibody repertoire to Haemophilus influenzae type B polysaccharide. Demonstration of three types of V regions and their association with H and L chain isotypes.
AB  - The antibody response to Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide (Hib-PS) is pauciclonal but can vary between different individuals. To estimate the size of this antibody repertoire we examined the constant and V regions of human IgG anti-Hib antibodies from 14 individuals at the clonal level using various serologic and IEF methods. Examination of H chains showed that 11 of 14 individuals produced both IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies, two individuals produced only IgG2 and one individual produced only IgG1 antibody. All 14 individuals produced kappa-containing antibody clones and three persons also produced significant lambda-containing antibody clones. V region heterogeneity was examined by comparing cross-reactivity of anti-Hib-PS antibodies to the capsular polysaccharide of Escherichia coli K100 carbohydrate (K100 CHO). These studies showed that clones of IgG anti-Hib-PS antibodies cross-reactive with K100 CHO were present in 5 of 14 (36%) individuals and also revealed at least three types of V regions among these antibodies. The first type has no cross-reaction with K100 CHO and was found in 13 of the 14 individuals. The second type, found in three of 14 individuals, cross-reacts with K100 CHO and uses a lambda L chain V region. The third type, found in 2 of 14 individuals, cross-reacts with K100 CHO and uses a kappa L chain V region. Although the lambda type V region was found only in association with IgG2, the other two V region types associate with both IgG1 and IgG2. Thus, five IgG antibody clones are serologically discernable. An individual generally responds to Hib-PS by expressing several clones selected from these discernable antibody clones. Indeed, we can observe six individual response patterns among these 14 individuals and conclude that considerable variability in individual responses to Hib-PS can be achieved with very few V regions.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a mutant of Haemophilus influenzae type b deficient in outer membrane protein P1.
AB  - The gene for outer membrane protein P1 of Haemophilus influenzae type b has been  previously cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. To investigate the physiologic role of the P1 protein, the cloned P1 gene was insertionally inactivated with the Tn5 derivative Tn5tac1, and an isogenic P1-deficient Haemophilus mutant was then generated by transformation with linearized plasmid DNA containing the insertionally inactivated gene. The P1-deficient strain grew normally in vitro and induced bacteremia in the infant rat model.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical evaluation of sulbactam/ampicillin in pediatrics].
AB  - The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) were evaluated in 21 children with a variety of infections. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Pharmacokinetics in 4 children, each receiving a single dose of 60 mg/kg, were evaluated. The average half-life of SBT was 1.03 hours and that of ABPC was 0.83 hour. 2. In vitro antimicrobiol activity (MIC) of SBT/ABPC in which SBT and ABPC are combined at a ratio of 1:2 was stronger than ABPC alone and was quite effective against Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae, but activity against Escherichia coli was relatively low. Antimicrobial activity of SBT/ABPC against S. aureus was almost equal to those of piperacillin (PIPC), cefazolin (CEZ) and cefmetazole (CMZ), but against H. influenzae was stronger than those of CEZ and CMZ. Activity against E. coli was lower than those of PIPC, CEZ and CMZ. 3. A total of 21 patients including 3 with pharyngitis, 10 with bronchitis, 5 with pneumonia, 1 each with acute enteritis, pyelonephritis and suspected sepsis were treated with SBT/ABPC. The clinical efficacy rate for these patients was 95.2% (20/21). The bacteriological eradication rate was 80% (8/10). 4. There were 4 instances of side effects, 1 case each of eruption, diarrhea, thrombocytosis and eosinophilia, but all symptoms were transient.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of sulbactam/ampicillin in the pediatric field].
AB  - The usefulness of sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) in the treatment of pediatric infections was evaluated. 1. Twenty pediatric patients with infection were treated with SBT/ABPC and an intravenous dosage of 27.8-47.4 mg/kg, 3 to 4 times a day. Clinical efficacies in 18 patients excluding 2 patients of Mycoplasma pneumonia (9 cases of pneumonia, 6 urinary tract infection, 1 tonsillitis, 1 maxillary sinusitis and 1 osteomyelitis) were judged to be excellent in 13 patients and good in 5. There was no case of failure. 2. Bacteriological efficacies against 16 strains (1 Staphylococcus aureus, 3 Enterococcus faecalis, 4 Haemophilus influenzae, 2 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 5 Escherichia coli and 1 Serratia sp.) isolated from 13 of the 18 patients were rated as "eradicated" for 13 strains, "decreased" for 1 and "unchanged" for 2 with an eradication rate of 81.3%. Of 13 strains eradicated, 3 were those with high beta-lactamase productivity. 3. Rash as a side effect developed in 1 patient and eosinophilia and elevated GOT and GPT were observed in 7 patients but none of them were serious. 4. Blood levels of the drug following an intravenous dose of 30 mg/kg were determined in 2 pediatric patients. Blood levels of SBT and ABPC at 30 minutes after intravenous administration were 19.0 and 29.2 micrograms/ml in one patient and 21.0 and 31.6 micrograms/ml in another, respectively, and those at 4 hours were 0.48 and 0.62 microgram/ml in one patient and 0.59 and 0.89 microgram/ml in another, respectively. The half-lives of SBT were 0.67 and 0.70 hour and those of ABPC were 0.64 and 0.69 hour in the 2 patients, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Studies on sulbactam/ampicillin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) were carried out in the field of pediatrics. 1. Absorption and excretion Serum levels and urinary excretion of SBT/ABPC were studied in 4 children with ages 6 to 8 years. The mean serum concentration of SBT at 15 minutes following a single intravenous injection of 30 mg/kg of SBT/ABPC was 27.4 +/- 2.2 micrograms/ml and that of ABPC was 42.8 +/- 3.9 micrograms/ml, and their concentrations declined with mean half-lives of 1.06 +/- 0.15 hours and 0.84 +/- 0.05 hour, respectively, and at 6 hours were 0.3 +/- 0.2 microgram/ml and 0.2 +/- 0.1 microgram/ml on the average, respectively. The urinary recovery rates of SBT and ABPC at 6 hours after the injection were 59.0 +/- 22.4% and 58.4 +/- 25.3% on the average, respectively. 2. Clinical study SBT/ABPC was used for the treatment of a total of 36 pediatric patients with ages ranging 2 months to 11 years and it's clinical effectiveness, bacteriological efficacy and adverse effects were evaluated. Clinical efficacies in 5 patients with acute purulent tonsillitis, 26 with acute pneumonia and 1 with acute pyelonephritis were judged to be excellent in 27 cases and good in 5 cases with an overall efficacy ratio of 100.0%. Clinical efficacies in 6 patients whose infections were caused by beta-lactamase producing strains were judged to be excellent in all cases. Bacteriological efficacies of SBT/ABPC were assessed on 1 strain of Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase producing strain), 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 16 strains of Haemophilus influenzae (5 beta-lactamase producing strains and 11 non-beta-lactamase producing strains), 1 non-beta-lactamase strain of Haemophilus parainfluenzae and 2 strains of Escherichia coli (non-beta-lactamase producing strains). All strains except 1 strain of H. influenzae (beta-lactamase producing strain) which decreased in number were eradicated with a bacteriological eradication rate of 95.5%. Only 1 patient complained of diarrhea which was suspected to be related to the drug. No other side effect was reported. Elevations of GOT and GPT were observed in only 1 patient. The above results suggested that SBT/ABPC was a useful drug with preferable safety profile in the treatment for pediatric patients with infectious disease caused by beta-lactamase producing strains as well as those by non-beta-lactamase producing strains.
TI  - [Clinical studies on sulbactam/ampicillin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - During 8 months from October 1986 to May 1987, the clinical efficacy of sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) was evaluated in 63 pediatric inpatients with various infections. Clinical efficacies were evaluable in 58 patients among them (consisting of 2 patients with sepsis, 3 with tonsillitis, 12 with bronchitis, 6 with bronchopneumonia, 24 with pneumonia, 1 with phlegmon, 2 with lymphadenitis, 1 with impetigo and 7 with urinary tract infection) and were excellent in 40 patients and good in 17 with an overall efficacy rate of 98.3%. Bacteriological efficacies were assessed in 25 patients and 27 strains of organisms (consisting of 3 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 Streptococcus pyogenes, 2 beta-Streptococcus, 1 Gram-positive cocci, 5 Escherichia coli, 1 Enterobacter aerogenes, 7 Haemophilus influenzae, 2 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 1 Branhamella catarrhalis, 1 Proteus mirabilis and 1 Salmonella subgenus I). Bacteriological eradication rates were 88.9% for Gram-positive organisms, 66.7% for Gram-negative organisms and 74.1% overall. No superinfection was observed in any of patients treated. Side effects and clinical laboratory parameter abnormalities observed consisted of diarrhea in 7 (11.1%) of the 63 patients, eosinophilia in 2 (3.3%) of 61 tested, thrombocytosis in 3 (5.5%) of 55, elevation of direct bilirubin in 1 (3.3%) of 30, elevation of total bilirubin in 1 (3.1%) of 32, elevation of GOT in 4 (6.8%) of 59 and elevation of GPT in 1 (1.7%) of 59 patients tested. As an effect on the hemostatic mechanism of this drug, PIVKA II was detected in 1 patient (4.2%) of 24 tested, but findings of other coagulation tests were normal and none of patients showed bleeding tendency or inhibition of platelet aggregation. From the above results, it appears that SBT/ABPC is an efficacious and safe drug in the treatment of bacterial infections of pediatric patients.
TI  - Site-specific recombination between cloned attP and attB sites from the Haemophilus influenzae bacteriophage HP1 propagated in recombination-deficient Escherichia coli.
AB  - Plasmids were constructed which contain both attP and attB DNA segments derived from the insertion sites of the lysogenic bacteriophage HP1 and its host, Haemophilus influenzae. Similar plasmids containing the two junction segments (attL and attR regions) between the phage genome and the lysogenic host chromosome were also prepared. The formation of recombinant dimer plasmids was observed when attP-attB plasmids were propagated in Escherichia coli HB101 (recA), while plasmids containing the junction segments did not form recombinant dimers. Deletion of the phage DNA segment adjacent to the attP site from the attP-attB constructions eliminated detectable recombination, suggesting that this sequence contains the gene encoding the HP1 integrase. No plasmid recombination was observed in strains of E. coli defective in integration host factor. This suggests that integration host factor is important in the expression or activity of the system which produces the site-specific recombination of sequences derived from HP1 and H. influenzae. Further, it suggests that a protein functionally analogous to E. coli integration host factor may be present in H. influenzae.
TI  - A clinical evaluation of sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of pediatric infections.
AB  - We have treated 42 episodes of pediatric infections with sulbactam/ampicillin since 1987. Included were 9 cellulitis, 9 urinary tract infections, 5 cervical lymphadenitis, 4 meningitis, 2 thoracic empyema, 2 osteomyelitis, 2 sepsis, 1 furuncle, 1 perianal abscess, 1 dental abscess, 1 peritonsillitis, 1 salmonellosis, 1 shigellosis, 1 peritonitis, 1 suppurative thyroiditis, 1 infective endocarditis. Responsible pathogens were Escherichia coli in 8, Staphylococcus aureus in 6, Hemophilus influenzae in 2, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 3, Streptococcus viridans in 2, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 1, Bacteroides fragilis in 1, Salmonella D1 in 1, Shigella sonnei in 1, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 1, Enterobacter agglomerans in 1, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus in 1, Enterobacter cloacae in 1, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus in 1, and polymicrobial infection in 4 cases. Thirty-nine out of 41 (95%) clinically evaluable patients cured and all (34/34) bacteriologically evaluable patients eradicated their pathogens after treatment with sulbactam/ampicillin. Side reactions were seen in five patients; one maculopapular skin rash, one hemolytic anemia, two diarrhea, and one liver function impairment plus leukopenia. All these reactions were transient and did not require interruption of therapy. These results indicate that sulbactam/ampicillin is safe and effective in the treatment of common pediatric infections beyond the neonatal period.
TI  - [The ratios and kinds of clinical bacteria isolated in Taiwan's large-size hospitals].
AB  - The prevalence of clinical bacteria, as isolated from Linko Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital (2,300 beds) in the period January 1985 to December 1986 and from Taipei Veterans General Hospital (2,300 beds) during the period January 1986 to December 1986, was analyzed with the following findings: (i) The isolation ratio of anaerobic and aerobic or facultative bactria during the period of investigation were 7.8% (5,513/70,799) and 92.2% (65,286/70,799), respectively. (ii) Of the total aerobic or facultative isolates from the two hospitals, 32.9% (21,510/65,286) were Gram positive cocci and bacilli, 67.1% (43,776/65,286) were Gram negative cocci and bacilli. (iii) Of these Gram-negative bacilli, 65.2% (28,490/43,675) were Enterobacteriaceae were Enterobacteriaceae and glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli, 32.0% (13,984/43,675) were glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, and 2.7% (1,200/43,675) were fastidious Gram negative bacilli. (iv) The more common species among the members of Enterobacteriaceae were Escherichia coli 35.7% (10,163/28,490), and Klebsiella pneumoniae 18.2% (5,186/28,490). The other common species included Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii and Proteus vulgaris. The frequencies of Salmonella species and Shigella species in these two large hospitals were up to 1.6% (456/28,490) and 0.5% (149/28,490), respectively. The most common isolate among other glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli was Aeromonas hydrophila 3.0% (843/28,490). The finding of 0.1% (11/28,490) Vibrio alginolyticus was considered as clinically significant in Taiwan. (v) Of these glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, 69.4% (9,704/13,984) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18.9% (2,637/13,984) Acinetobacter species, 10.8% (1,516/13,984) Pseudomonas species. (vi) The most common bacteria among fastidious Gram negative bacilli was Haemophilus influenzae, 96.2% (1,154/1,200). (vii) Of these Gram negative cocci, 59.4% (60/101) was Neisseria gonorrhoeae and 6.9% (7/101) N. meningitidis. (viii) The more common isolates of Gram positive bacilli included Bacillus species and Corynebacterium species (diphtheroids). (ix) Of these Gram positive cocci, the isolation rates of Staphylococcus species and Streptococcus species were 54.6% (10,838/19,827) and 45.4% (9,002/19,847), respectively. The most common isolate among Gram positive cocci was Staphylococcus aureus, 30.2% (5,994/19,847); the next, enterococcus, 24.9% (4,936/19,847); then S. epidermidis, 22.2% (4,390/19,847). The less common isolates were Streptococcus pyogenes 1.1% (212/19,847) and S. pneumoniae, 1.7% (329/19,847).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Broncho-alveolar lavage by fibroscopy in immunodepressed children].
AB  - Thirty broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) were performed in order to investigate 30 infectious episodes in immunocompromised children. Twenty patients were previously treated by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation and 6 other patients by conventional methods. A specific etiologic diagnosis was obtained in 16 of 30 episodes (56%), 22 microorganisms were identified by BAL. The most frequently involved microorganism was Candida albicans and the other agents were as follows: 3 cytomegalovirus, 2 Pneumococcus, 2 Pneumocystis carinii, 1 Aspergillosis, 1 syncytial respiratory virus, 1 myxovirus, 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 1 Haemophilus influenzae and 1 Escherichia coli. In 5 cases, more than 2 agents were involved. This study emphasizes the diagnostic interest of BAL for infectious diseases of the immunocompromised child. BAL appears to be a non invasive, rapid and reproducible method, and a useful therapeutic approach in the treatment of infectious episodes occurring in grafted children where several microorganisms could be involved at the same time.
TI  - Aztreonam in the treatment of aerobic, gram-negative bacillary infections in pediatric patients.
AB  - Aztreonam was administered to 20 children diagnosed as having any of the following infections: urinary tract infection, pneumonia, meningitis, and abscess of the appendix. Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of aztreonam for these bacteria ranged from 0.03 to 0.5 micrograms/ml. All patients were clinically and bacteriologically cured within 5-16 days of treatment. Six months after completion of therapy, patients who had had meningitis appeared to be free of any neurologic sequelae. The antibiotic was well tolerated by all patients.
TI  - [Loading of polystyrene solid phases with microbial agents and their polysaccharide antigens for the screening of monoclonal antibodies].
AB  - Before screening monoclonal antibodies using enzyme immuno assays, it is necessary to prove that the coating of the solid phases occurs efficiently. The adhesion of whole cells of group B streptococci, Escherichia coli K1, Haemophilus influenzae type b and Candida albicans as well as B-Streptococcus group antigen, H. influenzae type b capsular antigen, and C. albicans cell wall antigen to polystyrene solid phases was studied and detected by the following methods: Peroxidase competition procedure, scintillation measurement of 32phosphate-labelled germs, and reactions with monoclonal antibodies.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of dactimicin in vitro compared with that of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of dactimicin, a pseudo-disaccharide aminoglycoside antibiotic, was compared with those of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin using clinical isolates of four Gram-positive and sixteen Gram-negative bacteria. Dactimicin was more active than the reference amino-glycosides against Serratia marcescens, especially gentamicin-resistant Serratia sp., Proteus vulgaris, P. rettgeri and Klebsiella oxytoca, but less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. mirabilis. Dactimicin was equally active as the references excepting netilmicin against Gram-positive bacteria and some Gram-negative bacteria including Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogens, E. cloacae, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Campylobacter jejunii. Dactimicin was active against resistant strains possessing various aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes including AAC(3)-1, by which dactimicin was acetylated.
TI  - Ceftriaxone monotherapy for severe bacteremic infections. Spanish Ceftriaxone Study Group.
AB  - We tested the efficacy of a single daily dose of ceftriaxone (active ingredient of Rocephin) for the treatment of severe bacteremic infections in 125 non-neutropenic adult patients. A single daily dose of ceftriaxone ranging from 1 to 4 g was given. Surgical procedures were performed if needed. Seventy-six (60.8%) were males and bacteremia was nosocomially acquired in 45 (36%). Microbiologically proven bacteremia was demonstrated in all patients. The most common microorganisms isolated were Escherichia coli (46 episodes), Streptococcus pneumoniae (17 episodes), Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella sp., and Staphylococcus aureus (9, 7, 6, 6, respectively). The urinary tract was the source of the bacteremia in 45 cases (36%), and the lower respiratory tract in 33 (26.4%). Mean duration of treatment was 10.8 days (range 3-21 days). One hundred and six patients (84.8%) recovered completely, 11 (8.8%) improved, but needed an alternative antibiotic treatment. An alternative treatment was also given to a patient whose condition had initially deteriorated. Seven patients (5.6%) died. Death was directly related to the infection in 2 cases. Three patients (2.4%) developed a superinfection, and 5 (4%) a severe (1 case) or mild (4 cases) adverse effect. In summary, a single daily dose of ceftriaxone proved to be useful for the treatment of selected severe bacteremic infections.
TI  - Molecular cloning, expression, and primary sequence of outer membrane protein P2  of Haemophilus influenzae type b.
AB  - The structural gene for the porin of Haemophilus influenzae type b, designated outer membrane protein P2, was cloned, and the DNA sequence was determined. An oligonucleotide probe generated by reverse translation of N-terminal amino acid sequence data from the purified protein was used to screen genomic DNA. The probe detected a single EcoRI fragment of approximately 1,700 base pairs which was cloned to lambda gt11 and then into M13 and partially sequenced. The derived amino acid sequence indicated that we had cloned the N-terminal portion of the P2 gene. An overlapping approximately 1,600-base-pair PvuII genomic fragment was cloned into M13, and the sequence of the remainder of the P2 gene was determined. The gene for P2 was then reconstructed under the control of the T7 promoter and expressed in Escherichia coli. The N-terminal sequence of the purified protein corresponds to residues 21 through 34 of the derived amino acid sequence. Thus, the protein is synthesized with a 20-amino-acid leader peptide. The Mr of the processed protein is 37,782, in good agreement with the estimate of 37,000 from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
TI  - Cloning of the HhaI and HinPI restriction-modification systems.
AB  - The genes for the HhaI (Roberts et al., 1976) and HinPI (Roberts, 1987) restriction-modification (R-M) systems have been cloned in pBR322. The HhaI system was isolated on a 9-kb PstI fragment, and the HinPI system was isolated on two PstI fragments of 1.5 and 4.6 kb in length. The clones were isolated by selecting for recombinant molecules that had protectively modified themselves. The HhaI and HinPI R-M systems recognize the same sequence, GCGC, but hybridization between the DNA fragments encoding them does not take place.

TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. It displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (CFIX), cefaclor (CCL) or cephalexin (CEX) against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococci including Staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the Streptococcus group. Moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, FK482 had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of CFIX but superior to that of CCL or CEX. However, it was clearly inferior to CFIX in activity against Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strains of S. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to FK482. All tested strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to CCL and CEX were susceptible to FK482, as were all the strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (AMPC). FK482, like CFIX, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except Bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of CCL or CEX. The antibacterial activity of FK482 against CSH2 strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. FK482 showed higher affinity for the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) (3, 2 and 1) of S. aureus than did CFIX, CCL and CEX. FK482 also showed very high affinity for the PBPs (2 and 3) of E. faecalis and PBPs (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of E. coli. The bactericidal activity of FK482 against S. aureus was almost as strong as that of AMPC and superior to that of CCL or CEX. Against Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis, FK482 was similar to CFIX and superior to CCL and CEX in bactericidal activity.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies of sultamicillin fine granule in pediatric field].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on sultamicillin (SBTPC) fine granule were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Antibacterial activities of SBTPC against clinically isolated strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Escherichia coli were compared with those of ampicillin (ABPC). SBTPC was superior to ABPC especially against beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae, E. coli, S. aureus, and B. catarrhalis. 2. Serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates of sulbactam (SBT) and ABPC after administration of SBTPC fine granule at a dose level of 10 mg/kg in 2 cases were determined. Mean half-lives of SBT and ABPC in the serum following oral administration were about 1.33 and 1.61 hours respectively. Mean urinary recovery rates of SBT and ABPC in 6 hours after oral administration at a dose of 10 mg/kg were 58.7% and 49.6% respectively. 3. SBTPC fine granule was administered to 20 pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (pneumonia 8 cases, bronchitis 2, pharyngitis 2, tonsillitis 4, subcutaneous abscess 1 and urinary tract infection 3). The overall clinical efficacy rate was 100% and the overall bacteriological eradication rate was 75%. 4. No adverse reactions were observed except 1 case of loose stool. No abnormal laboratory test values were observed. These results indicate the usefulness of SBTPC fine granule in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefixime, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activities of cefixime and seven comparative oral antimicrobials were studied. MIC90S of cefixime were 0.015-1 micrograms/ml for Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus, Providencia, Aeromonas hydrophila and Streptococcus. MIC90S for other Enterobacteriaceae were greater than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml; 44% of those strains were inhibited by less than or equal 1 microgram/ml. Staphylococcus, Psuedomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis were resistant to cefixime.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of monobactams against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - Antibacterial activities of monobactam antibiotics (carumonam (CRMN) and aztreonam (AZT] against Gram-negative bacilli isolated from inpatients in the latter half of 1987 were investigated using penicillin (PC: piperacillin (PIPC], cephems (CEPs: ceftazidime (CAZ), cefotaxime (CTX), latamoxef (LMOX), cefsulodin (CFS], carbapenem (imipenem (IPM] and pyridonecarboxylic acids (norfloxacin (NFLX) and ofloxacin (OFLX] as reference antibiotics. A total of 400 strains of 13 species, i.e. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae, were used as test strains. 1. CRMN and AZT, both monobactam antibiotics, were roughly comparable in their activities and no resistant strain to these antibiotics were found among isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., M. morganii, P. rettgeri or H. influenzae and few resistant strains were observed among isolates of S. marcescens. On the other hand, isolates of C. freundii, Enterobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa included rather numerous strains resistant to the monobactam antibiotics. Among these cases, whereas R strains, i.e. resistant strains showing MICs greater than or equal to 50 micrograms/ml, accounted for a large proportion of strains resistant to PC and CEPs, I strains, i.e. intermediately resistant strains showing MICs between 12.5 and 25 micrograms/ml, accounted for a large proportion of strains resistant to the monobactam antibiotics. 2. Strains resistant to PIPC, a PC, were detected with high and more or less uniform frequencies over the entire spectrum of the isolates examined. 3. Antibacterial activities of CEPs varied against different bacterial species. While strains resistant to CTX, CAZ and LMOX were commonly detected with high frequencies among isolates of C. freundii, Enterobacter spp. and S. marcescens, large percentages of LMOX-resistant strains of C. freundii and Enterobacter spp. were of the I type. CTX-resistant strains were also found among isolates of P. vulgaris and M. morganii. Proportions of CEP-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa were 28% for CFS and 12% for CAZ. 4. No or few strains among the isolates of 13 species investigated were resistant to IPM, a carbapenem antibiotic, which showed the most stable antibacterial activity, but it was less active than monobactam antibiotics and CEPs against Klebsiella spp., P. mirabilis and H. influenzae.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Cloning and sequencing the HinfI restriction and modification genes.
AB  - The HinfI restriction and modification genes were cloned on a 3.9-kb PstI fragment inserted into the PstI site of plasmid pBR322. Both genes are confined to an internal 2.3-kb BclI-AvaI subfragment. This subfragment was sequenced. Two large open reading frames (ORF's) are present. ORF1 codes for the methylase [predicted 359 amino acids (aa)] and ORF2 codes for the endonuclease (predicted 262 or 272 aa).
TI  - DNA probe technology for rapid detection of Haemophilus influenzae in clinical specimens.
AB  - In a previous study, we reported that a 5-kilobase Haemophilus influenzae DNA fragment involved in penicillin-binding protein expression could be used as a probe for specific detection of H. influenzae strains (F. Malouin and L. E. Bryan, Mol. Cell. Probes 1:221-232, 1987). Here, we report the ability of this probe to detect H. influenzae in clinical specimens. In a bacterial dot experiment, there was strong hybridization of the 32P-labeled probe to nonencapsulated and serotype a through f H. influenzae strains. The detection of H. influenzae in body fluids was then evaluated by using pooled human serum, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and sputum as dilution media for H. influenzae, Haemophilus aegyptius, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and Escherichia coli cells. At 65 degrees C, the probe hybridized to H. influenzae and H. aegyptius (greater than or equal to 10(5) cells) in all fluids. There was no hybridization with the E. coli negative control, and H. parainfluenzae hybridized when greater than or equal to 10(7) cells were used. Experiments performed at 73 and 80 degrees C permitted elimination of H. parainfluenzae hybridization. The detection of H. influenzae in 232 sputa from patients with respiratory tract infections was very specific (96 to 97%) and sensitive (74 to 100%) when the total time of the procedure was sufficient (6 to 24 h) and when the experiments were performed at 80 degrees C. In addition, the probe detected three of three and four of four H. influenzae-infected cerebrospinal fluids and blood cultures, respectively, and did not react with pneumococcus- or streptococcus-infected cerebrospinal fluids. Finally, by using a small-scale procedure, the probe rapidly detected H. influenzae in cerebrospinal fluid and sputum specimens (4 and 8 h, respectively). These results imply prompt diagnosis of H. influenzae infections caused by nonencapsulated and serotype a through f strains.
TI  - Cloning of the gene encoding the major outer membrane protein of Haemophilus influenzae type b.
AB  - The major outer membrane protein (P2) of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) with an apparent molecular weight of 37,000 to 40,000 has been previously shown to function as a porin and also as a target for antibodies protective against experimental Hib disease. The gene encoding the Hib P2 protein was cloned by using a shuttle vector capable of replication in both Escherichia coli and H. influenzae. The amino acid sequence of the amino terminus of the Hib P2 protein was determined and used to design an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the first 20 amino acids of this protein. This oligonucleotide probe was used to identify Hib chromosomal DNA fragments containing the Hib P2 gene. These DNA fragments were ligated into the plasmid vector pGJB103 and then used to transform a rec-1 mutant of H. influenzae Rd. Recombinant clones expressing the Hib P2 protein were identified in a colony blot-radioimmunoassay by using a monoclonal antibody specific for a surface epitope of the Hib P2 protein. The gene encoding this Hib protein was present on a 10-kilobase Hib DNA insert in the recombinant plasmid. Transformation experiments involving the recombinant plasmid suggested that unregulated synthesis of Hib P2 is a lethal event in E. coli. The recombinant Hib P2 protein was exposed on the surface of the recombinant H. influenzae strain. This recombinant strain was used to develop a system for detecting polyclonal serum antibodies directed against surface determinants of the Hib P2 protein. The availability of the gene encoding the Hib P2 protein should facilitate investigation of both the immunogenicity and the structure-function relationship(s) of this major outer membrane protein.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of cefoperazone. Evaluation of disc susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  - To interpret of the cefoperazone (CPZ) disc susceptibility test, a 4 category system is used in Japan, but a 3 category system is used in the U.S.A. and Europe. In the 4 category interpretation system of Showa CPZ disc the following classification is used: ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3 approximately 15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15 approximately 60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. In the 3 category system the classification used is as follows: susceptible MIC less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible MIC greater than 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, resistant MIC greater than 32 micrograms/ml, or susceptible MIC less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible MIC greater than 32 approximately 64 micrograms/ml, resistant MIC greater than 64 micrograms/ml, depending on dose levels, 1 or 2 g. Reliability of the CPZ disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate MICs by classifying the test results into 4 categories was studied using discs containing 1, 2, 5, 10, 30 and 75 micrograms. The MICs were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. A good negative correlation was observed between inhibitory zone diameters and MICs, showing reliability of the test using these discs. The results obtained with discs containing 30 or 75 micrograms of CPZ were well categorized into the 4 groups mentioned above. Some strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis, however, showed false positive results. When different break points of inhibitory zone diameters than those used for other bacteria were used for P. aeruginosa, and E. faecalis was excluded from the test, an excellent correlations were obtained. With 30 or 75 micrograms discs, it was unable to subclassify strains against which MICs of CPZ were below 3 micrograms/ml. However, with discs containing 1 to 10 micrograms, it was possible to separate the strains against which MICs were less than 0.5 microgram/ml. The fact that most frequent values of MICs of CPZ against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes etc. were less than 0.5 microgram/ml supports the usefulness of low dose discs. According to recently ongoing concepts on the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics and their penetration into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding appear to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. Only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except into hepatic biliary system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of cefuzonam. Evaluation of disc susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  - In vitro activities of cefuzonam (CZON) against 273 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of MIC's and the results of disc susceptibility test. The MIC's were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6)CFU/ml. The MIC80's of CZON against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Haemophilus influenzae and Citrobacter spp. were less than 0.20 microgram/ml. The MIC80's against Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes were both 6.25 micrograms/ml, and that against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 100 micrograms/ml. The MIC80's against Staphy-lococcus epidermidis were 25 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Approximately 70% of strains of S. aureus were inhibited at concentrations less than 1.56 microgram/ml. For the interpretation of the CZON Showa 30 micrograms disc susceptibility test a 4 category system was used. In the 4 category system for Showa disc containing CZON, the following classification inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed: ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC less than 60 micrograms/ml. Reliability of the CZON disc tests in estimating approximate MIC values was studied using Showa 30 micrograms discs and discs prepared in this laboratory containing 1-10 micrograms CZON. A good negative correlation was observed between inhibitory zone diameters and MIC's, showing the reliability of the disc method. The results of the test using Showa 30 micrograms disc against various clinical isolates were accurately classified into the 4 groups except those against P. aeruginosa. Some strains of P. aeuruginosa showed false positive results, exhibiting relatively larger inhibitory zone diameters compared with MIC's against these organisms. As CZON is not effective against P. aeruginosa a much better overall correlation between MIC's and the disc test would result when P. aeruginosa was excluded. With Showa 30 micrograms discs of various cephalosporins, sub-classification of strains with MIC less than 3 micrograms/ml cannot be achieved. In this study, however, it was demonstrated that differentiation of strains with MIC's less than 0.5-1.56 micrograms/ml was possible when discs containing 1-10 micrograms of CZON were used. According to recent concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Efficacy and safety of cefpirome (HR810).
AB  - Sixty adult patients with suspected systemic bacterial infections were treated with cefpirome 1 g or 2 g twice daily for 5-22 days. Forty-seven patients were evaluable for clinical efficacy. Diagnoses in evaluable patients were urinary tract infections (20), pneumonia (10), soft tissue infections (17), and bone and joint infections (4); four patients had two infections each. Nine patients were bacteraemic and all were cured; the responsible bacteria were Escherichia coli (6), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), and Haemophilus influenzae (1). One patient with a soft tissue infection failed to respond clinically to cefpirome. Bacteriologically, 41 of 48 isolated pathogens (85%) were eradicated. In wound cultures, three strains of Staphylococcus aureus and one each of Ps. aeruginosa and Str. faecalis persisted. One Enterobacter sp. relapsed in urine. Of isolated strains, only Str. faecalis and methicillin resistant Staph, epidermidis were resistant to cefpirome. Staph, aureus strains were inhibited in vitro by 0.25 to 2 mg/l of cefpirome in agar dilution. Adverse effects, probably or possibly related to cefpirome, were skin reactions (3), fever (1), Clostridium difficile diarrhoea (2), and disturbed taste sensation (1). Tolerance was good. Cefpirome is suitable for large-scale comparative trials.
TI  - In vitro activity of florphenicol.
AB  - Florphenicol was active at a lower concentration than chloramphenicol against over half of 234 recent clinical bacterial isolates. The majority (98%) of the isolates were inhibited by florphenicol at a concentration of 8 mg/l or less. Florphenicol was particularly effective against chloramphenicol resistant strains of Haemophilus influenzae. Klebsiella aerogenes and Bacteroides spp. Florphenicol was bacteristatic for salmonellae and Escherichia coli but bactericidal for Haemophilus influenzae. Florphenicol was slightly more active than chloramphenicol against Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma hominis and Mycoplasma pneumoniae but less active against Ureaplasma urealyticum.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of a new oral carbacephem, LY163892.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of a new oral carbacephem, LY163892, was compared with cefaclor, cephalexin, cephradine, cefadroxil and selected penicillins against 529 bacterial isolates. LY163892 exhibited greater activity in vitro than all four cephalosporins against Haemophilus influenzae, beta-lactamase producing Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus mirabilis. LY163892 had equivalent potency to cefaclor against non-beta-lactamase producing B. catarrhalis, streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. Group D beta-haemolytic streptococci, Proteus vulgaris, and methicillin-resistant staphylococci were universally resistant to LY163892 and the four cephalosporins. Broth dilution experiments indicated that LY163892 was bactericidal against a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms and suggested that the antibiotic had a similar degree of stability to the beta-lactamases of H. influenzae, B. catarrhalis and Staph. aureus as did cefaclor. The susceptibility of 16 strains of H. influenzae to LY163892 and cefaclor were equivalent when estimated using three different commercially available agar media. Addition of carbon dioxide to the incubation atmosphere significantly reduced the potency of both drugs.
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of fleroxacin, a new fluorinated quinolone.
AB  - The in-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activities of fleroxacin were compared with those of other new quinolones including NY-198. Fleroxacin showed potent activity against most members of the Enterobacteriaceae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae, and good activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococci. Against these bacteria, the activity of fleroxacin was roughly comparable to that of norfloxacin, enoxacin, NY-198, and ofloxacin, but slightly less than that of ciprofloxacin. Fleroxacin strongly inhibited DNA supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase purified from Escherichia coli which may explain its high antibacterial activity. The protective effects of a single oral dose of fleroxacin in mice were greater than those of norfloxacin and comparable to or greater than that of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and NY-198 against systemic infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Esch. coli and Ps. aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens.
TI  - Comparative, multicenter studies of cefixime and amoxicillin in the treatment of  respiratory tract infections.
AB  - A total of 560 patients were treated in two double-blind, randomized multicenter  studies to compare the safety and efficacy of cefixime (400 mg administered once daily) and amoxicillin (250 or 500 mg administered three times daily) for the treatment of bacterial respiratory tract infections. Eighty percent of the 244 patients treated in the lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) study had acute bronchitis. Streptococcus pneumoniae (13 percent), Haemophilus influenzae (28 percent), and Escherichia coli (10 percent) were the pathogens most frequently isolated from sputum in these patients. Among evaluable patients with positive bacterial culture results at baseline, a favorable clinical response (cured or improved) was obtained in 100 percent of the cefixime-treated patients (22 of 22) and in 96 percent of the amoxicillin-treated patients (23 of 24). Bacteriologic eradication rates were 100 percent and 83 percent for cefixime and amoxicillin, respectively. In the upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) study, 316 patients with pharyngitis (80 percent) or tonsillitis (14 percent) were treated. Group A, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (69 percent) and H. influenzae (8 percent) were the pathogens most frequently isolated from the throat culture specimens of these patients. Favorable clinical results were obtained in 99 percent of the evaluable cefixime-treated group (n = 73) and in 98 percent of the amoxicillin-treated group (n = 66). The bacteriologic eradication rates were 93 percent and 100 percent, respectively. The adverse experiences reported during both studies were similar in nature and frequency to those reported for other beta-lactam antibiotics with the exception of a higher incidence of altered bowel movement (diarrhea and stool changes) with both drugs. These episodes usually resolved without remedial medication when the treatment was withdrawn. No significant adverse laboratory findings were observed. Results of these trials demonstrate that cefixime at a dosage of 400 mg once daily is an effective and safe oral antibiotic for the treatment of acute respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Once-daily administration of ceftriaxone for the treatment of selected serious bacterial infections in children.
AB  - Ceftriaxone treatment (50 to 80 mg/kg once daily) was given to 201 children between 1 month and 18 years of age. There were 201 serious bacterial infections, including epiglottitis, pneumonia, cellulitis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, pyelonephritis, sepsis, and meningitis. The common pathogens responsible for pediatric infections isolated from these patients included Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. The overall clinic cure rate was 94%. Ten patients were clinically improved but not cured. There were two clinical failures. Bacteriologic failure occurred in six patients. The overall bacteriologic cure rate was 97%. Twenty patients (10%) experienced adverse effects; none required discontinuation of therapy. The efficacy, safety, spectrum, and convenience of ceftriaxone monotherapy make this antimicrobial agent a candidate for the treatment of choice of selected serious pediatric infections.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of ME1207, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - ME1207 (pivaloyloxymethyl ester of ME1206) is a new oral cephalosporin. ME1206 is (6R,7R)-7-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(methoxyimino)- acetamido]-3-[(Z)-2-(4-methylthiazol-5-yl)-ethyl]-cephem-4-carboxy lic acid. The susceptibilities of about 1,600 clinical isolates to ME1206 were determined by the agar dilution method. ME1206 showed a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. ME1206 was more active than cefaclor, T-2525, and cefixime against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of ME1206 was comparable with that of T-2525, but ME1206 was less active than cefixime. Against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, ME1206 had high activity (MIC, less than or equal to 0.05 microgram/ml). ME1206 was stable against various beta-lactamases, except beta-lactamases from Providencia rettgeri, Pseudomonas cepacia, and Escherichia coli W3630 (Rms213). The 50% effective doses of ME1207 after oral administration against systemic infections in mice were comparable with those of T-2588 against gram-negative bacteria and about one-fourth that of T-2588 against Staphylococcus aureus Smith.
TI  - An in vitro evaluation of HRE 664, a novel penem antibiotic.
AB  - HRE 664 is a novel parenteral penem with a broad antimicrobial spectrum. In this  study, HRE 664 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml, oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci at less than or equal to 0.13 microgram/ml, oxacillin-resistant staphylococci at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml, enterococci at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml, and streptococci at less than or equal to 0.13 microgram/ml. All strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant (MICs were greater than 32 micrograms/ml). HRE 664 exhibited a minimal inoculum effect and good bactericidal activity with all organisms tested except an oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. With the latter, there was a marked inoculum effect and no on-scale bactericidal endpoints. No measurable hydrolysis of HRE 664 occurred with any of the five Gram-negative bacterial beta-lactamases tested. When stored at -20 degrees C, HRE 664 showed no significant loss of activity for up to 6 wk, but detectable deterioration occurred thereafter. At -60 degrees C, no loss in HRE 664 potency was observed for up to 12 wk. Proposed HRE 664 MIC quality control parameters are: 0.03-0.13 microgram/ml for S. aureus ATCC 29213, 0.25-1.0 micrograms/ml for Escherichia coli 25922, and 2.0-8.0 micrograms/ml for Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212.
TI  - In vitro activities of PD 117,596 and reference antibiotics against 448 clinical  bacterial strains.
AB  - The in vitro activity of PD 117,596, a new fluoroquinolone antibiotic, was tested against 448 bacterial isolates (15 genera) by agar dilution (inoculum, 10(4) CFU per spot). The activity of PD 117,596 was compared with that of 15 antibiotics against 327 gram-negative strains and with that of 8 other antibiotics against 121 gram-positive strains. PD 117,596 demonstrated the best activity against Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, and Branhamella catarrhalis (MICs for 90% of the isolates [MIC90S], 0.008 to 0.25 microgram/ml). PD 117,596 (MIC90, 0.25 microgram/ml) was at least twofold more active than ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas spp. PD 117,596 and ciprofloxacin were similar in activity against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Legionella pneumophila, and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC90, 0.002 to 0.125 microgram/ml). PD 117,596 was more active than ciprofloxacin against streptococcal groups A, B, C, and G, S. pneumoniae, and enterococci (MIC90S, 0.06 to 0.125 microgram/ml). Against Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant isolates, PD 117,596 (MIC90S, 0.03 to 0.06 microgram/ml) was 4- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and was most active against Corynebacterium spp. PD 117,596 appears to be the most active fluoroquinolone to date, with excellent activity against gram-positive bacteria and enhanced activity against gram-negative aerobic-facultative bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of LY163892, an orally administered 1-carbacephem.
AB  - LY163892 was found to be similar to cefaclor and slightly superior to cephalexin  in antimicrobial activity and spectrum. Bacteria with MIC50 less than or equal to 8.0 mg/l included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, pathogenic Neisseria spp., oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci, and Streptococcus spp. Strains that produced plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases generally remained susceptible to LY163892. LY163892 was found to be bactericidal in general, but its MICs for some bacterial strains were adversely affected by increased inocula.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of tigemonam, a new monobactam.
AB  - The in-vitro activity against Gram-negative aerobic bacterial pathogens of a new  oral monobactam, tigemonam, was compared with those of amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, aztreonam, cefaclor, ceftazidime, cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin, co-trimoxazole and gentamicin, by an agar-dilution method. Tigemonam inhibited 90% of strains tested of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., Salmonella spp., Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis at concentrations of 0.25 mg/l or below. The MIC90 for Enterobacter spp. was 16 mg/l and for Citrobacter 4 mg/l. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant to tigemonam but susceptible to aztreonam. In comparison with the other oral antibiotics tested, tigemonam was generally more active. Tigemonam showed minimal inoculum dependence, between 10(2) and 10(6) cfu per spot. It is concluded that tigemonam is a candidate for clinical trials in patients with infections caused by Gram-negative aerobes other than pseudomonas and acinetobacter.
TI  - Mechanism of action and in vitro and in vivo activities of S-6123, a new oxazolidinone compound.
AB  - The in vitro activity of S-6123, a synthetic antimicrobial compound of the new oxazolidinone series, was compared with those of other orally administered agents against 328 clinical isolates. The compound was moderately active (MICs, 16 to 64 micrograms/ml) against 90% of staphylococci, nonenterococcal streptococci, and Haemophilus influenzae, including strains resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. S-6123 was minimally active against enterococci and facultative gram-negative bacilli. Nevertheless, the compound had significant activity in a lethal rat Escherichia coli peritonitis model at serum concentrations of one-tenth the MIC against the infecting organism. The drug demonstrated only bacteriostatic activity against susceptible organisms. Studies to define the mechanism of antibacterial action revealed that S-6123 inhibited ribosomal protein synthesis without inhibiting DNA or RNA synthesis. This compound represents a new series of antibacterial agents not related to any other antibacterial compound of natural or synthetic origin.
TI  - Characterization of the rec-1 gene of Haemophilus influenzae and behavior of the  gene in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The rec-1 gene of Haemophilus influenzae was cloned into a shuttle vector that replicates in Escherichia coli as well as in H. influenzae. The plasmid, called pRec1, complemented the defects of a rec-1 mutant in repair of UV damage, transformation, and ability of prophage to be induced by UV radiation. Although UV resistance and recombination were caused by pRec1 in E. coli recA mutants, UV induction of lambda and UV mutagenesis were not. We suggest that the ability of the H. influenzae Rec-1 protein to cause cleavage of repressors but not the recombinase function differs from that of the E. coli RecA protein.
TI  - Purification, cloning, and sequence of outer membrane protein P1 of Haemophilus influenzae type b.
AB  - Outer membrane protein P1 from Haemophilus influenzae type b MinnA was purified and partially characterized. Antiserum was generated against the purified protein and was used to immunologically screen a lamba EMBL3 genomic library prepared from strain MinnA DNA. A 4.2-kilobase-pair EcoRI-BamHI fragment containing the P1 gene was subcloned into pBR322. The recombinant protein was synthesized by Escherichia coli K-12, in which it localized to the outer membrane. The N-terminal sequence of the purified protein was determined and found to correspond to residues 23 through 36. The 22-amino-acid leader peptide had a typical structure, with two lysine residues near the amino terminus, a stretch of hydrophobic residues, and alanine residues at positions 20 and 22. The Mr of the processed protein was 47,752, which is in good agreement with the estimate of 50,000 from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Putative -35 and -10 promoter sequences were identified upstream from the translational start site. Codon usage was examined and determined to be substantially different than the codon preference in E. coli.
TI  - Many pulmonary pathogenic bacteria bind specifically to the carbohydrate sequence GalNAc beta 1-4Gal found in some glycolipids.
AB  - Pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death from infectious disease in the United States. To examine the possible role of carbohydrates as adhesion receptors for infection, several pulmonary pathogenic bacteria were studied for binding to glycosphingolipids. Radiolabeled bacteria were layered on thin-layer chromatograms of separated glycosphingolipids, and bound bacteria were detected by autoradiography. The classic triad of infectious bacteria found in cystic fibrosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus, along with other bacteria commonly implicated in typical pneumonia, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and certain Escherichia coli, bind specifically to fucosylasialo-GM1 (Fuc alpha 1-2Gal beta 1-3GalNAc beta 1-4Gal beta 1-4Cer), asialo-GM1 (Gal beta 1-3GalNAc beta 1-4Gal beta-1-4Galc beta 1-1Cer), and asialo-GM2 (GalNAc beta 1-4Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1Cer). Bacteria maintained in nutrient medium bind better than the same cells suspended in buffer. They do not bind to galactosylceramide, glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, trihexosylceramide, globoside, paragloboside, Forssman glycosphingolipid, or several other glycosphingolipids tested, including the gangliosides GM1, GM2, GM3, GD1a, GD1b, GT1b, and Cad. The finding that these pathogens do not bind to lactosylceramide suggests that beta 1-4-linked GalNAc, which is positioned internally in fucosylasialo-GM1 and asialo-GM1 and terminally in asialo-GM2, is required for binding. beta-N-Acetylgalactosamine itself, however, is not sufficient for binding, as the bacteria did not bind to globoside, which contains the terminal sequence GalNAc beta 1-3Gal. These data suggest that these bacteria require at least terminal or internal GalNAc beta 1-4Gal sequences unsubstituted with sialyl residues for binding. Other bacteria, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Salmonella species, and some E. coli, do not bind to the GalNAc beta 1-4Gal sequence. The biological relevance of these data is suggested by our finding that substantial amounts of asialo-GM1 occur in human lung tissue.
TI  - In-vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of LY163892.
AB  - LY163892 is a new orally absorbed carbacephem. It inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Str. pneumoniae at less than or equal to 1 mg/l, but was less active against group B streptococci and groups C, F, G and bovis streptococci with MICs of 1 to 2 mg/l for most but as high as 8 mg/l for some isolates. MIC90 of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus was 8 mg/l, but greater than 128 mg/l for methicillin-resistant staphylococci. LY163892 had activity similar to cefaclor and cephalexin with MIC90 values of 16 mg/l for Escherichia coli, 8 mg/l for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Yersinia enterocolitica, but was more active against Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis. It had no activity against Enterobacter, Providencia, Serratia, and Pseudomonas and Bacteroides spp. LY163892 was more rapidly lytic than cephalexin. It was hydrolyzed by a number of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. For TEM-1, the Km = 354.7 microM, Vmax = 2.5 microMoles/min/mg of protein, P99 Km = 24.3 microM, Vmax = 28.9 microM/min/micrograms of protein, Staph. aureus PC Km = 47.4 microM, Vmax = 2.7 microMoles/min/mg of protein. Overall it had beta-lactamase stability similar to cefaclor, less than cephalexin, and markedly less than cefuroxime.
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo activities of T-3262, a new pyridone carboxylic acid.
AB  - T-3262[p-toluenesulfonic acid salt of dl-7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-6-fluoro-1, 4-dihydro-4-oxo-1, 8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid monohydrate] is a new pyridone carboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The activity of T-3262 against most Enterobacteriaceae was comparable with that of ciprofloxacin except Proteus spp. and Providencia rettgeri and exceeded that of ofloxacin and norfloxacin. The activity of T-3262 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was comparable with that of ciprofloxacin, and T-3262 was more active than the other new quinolones against Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Branhamella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae, and also against staphylococci, streptococci, and Bacteroides fragilis. The protective effects of a single oral dose of T-3262 on systemic infection in mice were greater than norfloxacin. T-3262 was as effective as ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against systemic infections in an animal model with Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and more active against Ps. aeruginosa infections. T-3262 showed excellent activity against staphylococcal and streptococcal infections.
TI  - [Comparative antibacterial activity of fleroxacin: selection frequencies and outer membrane proteins of resistant mutants].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of fleroxacin was evaluated in 427 gram-positive and gram-negative strains, all isolated recently from clinical specimens and compared to that of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and co-trimoxazole. The activity of fleroxacin resembled to that of ofloxacin; its excellent activity against Haemophilus influenzae on the one hand and its lack of activity against beta-hemolytic streptococci on the other hand have to be mentioned. Selection frequencies for resistant clones were evaluated for clinical E. coli and Serratia marcescens isolates and the quinolones. With respect to clinical E. coli and Serratia marcescens isolates selection frequencies ranged from 10(-7) to 10(-9) in the presence of 2-fold or 8-fold the MIC. The outer membrane proteins of E. coli and Serratia marcescens wild-type strains were compared with those of their quinolone-resistant mutants. No discrepancies could be observed in E. coli, whereas some of the resistant Serratia marcescens mutants exhibited an increased expression of 31 kdal protein linked with a decrease of a 37 kdal major outer membrane protein. As these alterations could not be observed in each of the resistant mutants, it cannot be decided at present whether such alterations may provide an explanation for the resistance observed.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the new oral macrolide azithromycin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new oral macrolide azithromycin was compared with that of erythromycin against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Ninety percent of hemolytic streptococci groups A and B, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml. Activity of azithromycin was similar to that of erythromycin; erythromycin-resistant staphylococci and streptococci were not inhibited. Azithromycin was more active than erythromycin against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 1 microgram/ml) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It inhibited Campylobacter spp. and Pasteurella multocida, and had an MIC50 of 8 micrograms/ml for Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp. and Yersinia enterocolitica compared to an erythromycin value of greater than 64 micrograms/ml.
TI  - rRNA gene restriction patterns of Haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegyptius strains associated with Brazilian purpuric fever.
AB  - The rRNA gene restriction patterns of 92 isolates of Haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegyptius, associated with conjunctivitis or Brazilian purpuric fever in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, were studied with 16 + 23S rRNA from Escherichia coli as a probe. All strains were classified into 15 patterns. Isolates from Brazilian purpuric fever cases were seen only in patterns 3 (most frequently) and 4 (rarely), whereas isolates from conjunctivitis were found in all 15 patterns. The study demonstrated that rRNA from E. coli can serve as a probe for molecular epidemiology.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein from  Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - We have purified to homogeneity a peptidoglycan-associated protein from Haemophilus influenzae. Our purification process used differential extraction of cell envelopes with nondenaturing detergents. Solubilization of this protein was accomplished by heating a peptidoglycan-enriched subcellular fraction in the presence of one of several nondenaturing detergents at 55-60 degrees C. The purified protein migrated as a single band, with a Mr approximately 15,000, following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This protein contains covalently linked fatty acids, is rich in tyrosine, but lacks methionine and tryptophan. Amino acid analysis also revealed the presence of glycerylcysteine, which has been shown to be the site of fatty acylation in other bacterial lipoproteins. Over 87% of the primary structure has been determined by sequencing high pressure liquid chromatography purified fragments derived from several endoproteinase digests. This protein belongs to a family of proteins, known as peptidoglycan associated lipoproteins, which appear to be components of the outer membranes of most Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activity of U-76,252 (CS-807), a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - U-76,252 is the prodrug of U-76,253. MICs of U-76,253 were 0.015 to 0.06 microgram/ml for greater than or equal to 90% of the strains of Streptococcus spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Proteus mirabilis; 0.25 to 1 microgram/ml for Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Citrobacter diversus; 1 to 8 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus spp.; and 2 to greater than 16 micrograms/ml for other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Aeromonas hydrophila; for 72% of the latter group, MICs were less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. MICs for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis were greater than 16 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Contribution of Haemophilus influenzae type b lipopolysaccharide to pathogenesis  of infection.
AB  - The mechanism(s) by which the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Haemophilus influenzae  type b may contribute to the virulence of this organism is unclear. Purified LPS of Haemophilus influenzae type b or phosphate buffered saline was administered intranasally to infant rats prior to the intranasal instillation of approximately 2-20 x 10(6) cfu of Hib two or three times per day for three consecutive days. The preadministration of 2.0 micrograms Hib LPS resulted in a significantly greater incidence of bacteremia (P = 0.0006) than PBS 30 min after the completion of the intranasal inoculation. Four days following completion of intranasal Hib inoculation the incidence of bacteremia was greater (P = 0.017) in the animals pretreated with LPS at 2.0 micrograms compared to the PBS pretreated animals. Preadministration of 0.2 micrograms LPS had no effect on the incidence of bacteremia or meningitis. There were no differences in the histology of the nasal cavities or turbinates of infant rats inoculated intranasally only with LPS or PBS. There were no differences in the frequency or density of bacteremia following intranasal administration of LPS from either Hib or E. coli. Although the mechanism is unknown, our findings suggest that the LPS of Hib may contribute to the ability of H. influenzae type b to invade the nasal mucosa in this infant rat model.
TI  - Studies on P6, an important outer-membrane protein antigen of Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - P6, a 16,600-dalton outer-membrane protein of Haemophilus influenzae, possesses many characteristics desired of a vaccine candidate. The protein is present in all strains of H. influenzae tested by analyses of outer-membrane protein profiles and with a monoclonal antibody. P6 is surface-exposed, as demonstrated by immunostaining techniques. Studies using monoclonal and polyclonal antisera indicate that P6 is a highly conserved antigen on the outer membrane of H. influenzae. Finally, experiments using affinity chromatography and normal human serum establish that P6 is a target of human bactericidal antibodies. The gene encoding P6 has been isolated and cloned into Escherichia coli, an accomplishment that will facilitate molecular analysis of the role of P6 in human immunity to H. influenzae.
TI  - Rapid method for the differentiation of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria  on membrane filters.
AB  - Microfiltration has become a popular procedure for the concentration and enumeration of bacteria. We developed a rapid and sensitive method for the differentiation of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, utilizing a polycarbonate membrane filter, crystal violet, iodine, 95% ethanol, and 6% carbol fuchsin, that can be completed in 60 to 90 s. Gram reactions of 49 species belonging to 30 genera of bacteria were correctly determined by the filter-Gram stain. The sensitivities of the filter-Gram stain and conventional slide-Gram stain were compared by testing dilutions of Escherichia coli, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae suspensions in the presence and absence of whole human blood. The filter-Gram stain was approximately 100-fold more sensitive than the slide-Gram stain. The filter-Gram stain detected 2 to 100 bacteria, whereas the slide-Gram stain failed to detect less than 1,000 bacteria. The sensitivities of the methods were not significantly altered by the addition of whole human blood to the dilutions of bacteria tested. The filter-Gram stain could be a useful tool for the examination of body fluids with very low numbers of bacteria.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a UV-sensitive mutator (mutB1) mutant of Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The mutB1 mutant of Haemophilus influenzae is very sensitive to UV radiation but  only slightly sensitive to methylmethane sulfonate or N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. Cultures of mutB1 cells contain high numbers of spontaneous mutants and show hypermutability after exposure to the latter mutagen. Normally high-efficiency transforming markers, as well as low-efficiency ones, transform mutB1 recipients at similarly low efficiencies. Significant host cell reactivation was observed when mutB1 cells were exposed to UV-damaged phage; however, these mutants showed a decrease in phage recombination. This mutant did not degrade its DNA following exposure to UV. It is speculated that the mutB1 mutation is similar to the Escherichia coli uvrD mutation.
TI  - [Comparison of in vitro activity of 4 oral beta-lactams on microorganisms responsible for broncho-pulmonary infections in children].
AB  - MIC 90 and MBC 90 of amoxicillin, cefaclor, cefadroxil and cefuroxime axetil have been determined by the microdilution method against 48 organisms responsible of acute respiratory tract infections in children: 17 E. coli, 15 K. pneumoniae, 16 H. influenzae. An inoculum effect and an inhibitory index in blood and bronchial secretions were determined. An inoculum effect was more important for amoxicillin and cefadroxil than for cefuroxime axetil and cefaclor. Against H. influenzae, cefuroxime axetil and cefaclor have a similar activity. Against Enterobacteria, cefuroxime axetil has the lowest MIC 90 and MBC 90 and the highest inhibitory index.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of a new fluorinated 4-quinolone, T-3262 (A-60969).
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new quinolone, T-3262 [A-60969; DL-7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-6-fluoro-1-, 4-dihydro-4-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid monohydrate], was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, ceftazidime, imipenem, and gentamicin. T-3262 inhibited 90% of isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. It was two to four times more active than ofloxacin and similarly or slightly less active than ciprofloxacin. Ninety percent of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited at 0.5 micrograms/ml. It was 4- to 8-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and 8- to 16-fold more active than ofloxacin against Pseudomonas cepacia and Pseudomonas maltophilia, which were resistant to imipenem and gentamicin. Most Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Branhamella catarrhalis isolates were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml. The MIC for 90% of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, was 0.12 micrograms/ml; that for Staphylococcus epidermidis was 0.5 micrograms/ml, as was that for Enterococcus faecalis. It inhibited 90% of Bacteroides fragilis isolates at 2 micrograms/ml, considerably more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. The frequency of spontaneous point mutational resistance was less than 10(-10) for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp. Resistant strains could be selected by repeated subculture. Similar to other quinolones, its activity could be affected by culture conditions. T-3262 showed a postantibiotic suppressive effect on Escherichia coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus.
TI  - In vitro activity of an oral iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, R-3746.
AB  - The in vitro activity of R-3746, an iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a CH2OCH3 moiety at position 3, was compared with those of other antibiotics. R-3746 inhibited the majority of hemolytic streptococci (groups A, B, C, F, and G) and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than 0.06 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the activity of amoxicillin, 2- to 8-fold more active than cefixime, and 16- to 64-fold more active than cefaclor and cephalexin. Ninety percent of beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited at a concentration 0.25 micrograms/ml, but it was less active against Branhamella spp. It did not inhibit (MIC, greater than 16 micrograms/ml) enterococci, viridans group streptococci, or methicillin-resistant staphylococci. The MICs of R-3746 for 90% of strains tested for Escherichia coli; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Citrobacter diversus; Proteus mirabilis; and Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia spp. were less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. It was two- to eightfold less active than cefixime but was markedly superior to cefaclor, cephalexin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. R-3746 inhibited 50% of Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Morganella spp., Providencia spp., Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens at less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. Pseudomonas spp. were resistant. Fifty percent of Clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, but MICs for Bacteroides spp. were greater than 128 micrograms/ml. R-3746 was not appreciably hydrolyzed by most chromosomal and plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases.
TI  - [Clinical and fundamental studies on intravenous drip infusion of gentamicin in the pediatric field. Pediatric study group of gentamicin].
AB  - A multiclinic study of gentamicin (GM) given by intravenous drip infusion was carried out by the Gentamicin Pediatric Study Group. The results are summarized as follows: 1. Upon intravenous drip infusion of GM at a dose range of 2.0-2.5 mg/kg over a period of 0.5-1 hour, therapeutically effective serum concentrations of 4-12 micrograms/ml were obtained. These values are similar to reported values in previous studies using GM intramuscular injection. 2. High urinary concentrations were observed up to 6 hours after administration, and the urinary recovery rate was approximately 60%. 3. Of a total of 142 cases collected, 117 cases were evaluated. Efficacy rates by diseases were: 100% in pneumonia (30/30), 98.3% in urinary tract infections (59/60), and 92.3% in other infections (skin and soft tissue) (12/13), with an overall efficacy rate of 94.9% (including 77 "excellent" cases). 4. Bacteriological examinations showed high eradication rates with the use of GM; i.e., 80% with Staphylococcus aureus (8/10), 60% with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3/5), 100% with Haemophilus influenzae (7/7) and 97.8% with Escherichia coli (44/45), achieving an overall eradication rate of 92.4%. In mixed infections, the eradication rate was 85.7% (6/7). 5. No ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity or allergic reactions was observed. Abnormal laboratory findings observed were: GOT elevation in 3.1% of cases, GPT elevation in 3.9%, platelet increase in 1.5% and eosinophil increase in 0.8%, thus an overall rate of the appearance of abnormality was 5.6%. The above results indicate that an intravenous drip infusion of GM is a useful method for treating infections in pediatrics.
TI  - In vitro activity of lomefloxacin (SC-47111; NY-198), a difluoroquinolone 3-carboxylic acid, compared with those of other quinolones.
AB  - Lomefloxacin (SC-47111; NY-198) is a new difluoroquinolone agent. It inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Aeromonas spp., Yersinia spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Lomefloxacin inhibited 90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 4 micrograms/ml. Lomefloxacin was equal in activity to norfloxacin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae but was twofold less active against Proteus spp., Providencia spp., Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp. Ofloxacin was generally 2- to 4-fold more active, and ciprofloxacin was 4- to 16-fold more active. Lomefloxacin inhibited Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant isolates, but MICs for 90% of streptococcal species tested were 8 micrograms/ml. In the presence of 9 mM Mg2+, MICs for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were increased, as they were when they were tested in urine. A single-step increase in resistance to eightfold above the MIC occurred at a frequency of less than 10(-10), but serial transfer of bacteria in the presence of the agent produced MIC increases. Lomefloxacin had activity and properties comparable to those of many of the new quinolones.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of aztreonam against pediatric purulent meningitis].
AB  - A monotherapy of aztreonam (AZT) was applied to 9 male and 3 female pediatric patients of ages ranging from 2 months to 8 years and 11 months with serious purulent meningitis. The results are summarized as follows: 1. Daily dosages of 134 to 400 mg/kg were given 3 to 4 times a day for 10 to 28 days. 2. The isolated pathogens were Neisseria meningitidis in 2 cases, Escherichia coli in 3 cases, Haemophilus influenzae in 6 cases, but the pathogen of the last case was unknown. In this case, the patient had myelomeningocele and suffered from recurrent purulent meningitis. 3. Clinical effect was "excellent" in 5 of 12 cases, "good" in 7 cases and efficacy rate was 100%. Microbiological tests were performed on 9 cases during the course of treatment and bacterial elimination rate was 100%. All the pathogens were eliminated in 72 hours. 4. One case of diarrhea was observed, but the diarrhea started before the administration of AZT and was stopped after the AZT treatment. A slight elevation of GOT value was observed in 1 case but the value returned to the initial level promptly after the treatment was completed. It is considered that AZT is highly useful for purulent meningitis caused by Gram-negative pathogens such as H. influenzae, E. coli and N. meningitidis.
TI  - Iron acquisition by Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The mechanisms for acquisition of iron by Haemophilus influenzae and their role in pathogenesis are not known. Heme and nonheme sources of iron were evaluated for their effect on growth of type b and nontypable strains of H. influenzae in an iron-restricted, defined medium. All 13 strains acquired iron from heme, hemoglobin, hemoglobin-haptoglobin, and heme-hemopexin. Among nonheme sources of protein-bound iron, growth of H. influenzae was enhanced by partially saturated human transferrin but not by lactoferrin or ferritin. Purified ferrienterochelin and ferridesferrioxamine failed to provide iron to H. influenzae, and the supernatants of H. influenzae E1a grown in iron-restricted medium failed to enhance iron-restricted growth of siderophore-dependent strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Arthrobacter terregens. Marked alterations in the profile of outer membrane proteins of H. influenzae were observed when the level of free iron was varied between 1 microM and 1 mM. Catechols were not detected in the supernatants of strain E1a; however, iron-related hydroxamate production was detected by two biochemical assays. We conclude that the sources of iron for H. influenzae are diverse. The significance of hydroxamate production and iron-related outer membrane proteins to H. influenzae iron acquisition is not yet clear.
TI  - Molecular cloning and mechanism of trimethoprim resistance in Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - We studied 10 trimethoprim-resistant (Tmpr) Haemophilus influenzae isolates for which agar dilution MICs were 10 to greater than 200 micrograms/ml. Trimethoprim resistance was transferred from two Tmpr H. influenzae isolates to a Tmps strain by conjugation or transformation. Wild-type Tmpr strains and Tmpr transcipients did not contain detectable plasmid DNA. The trimethoprim resistance gene was cloned into a cosmid vector, and recombinant plasmids were transduced into Escherichia coli. A 0.50-kilobase intragenic probe derived from a 12.9-kilobase fragment which encoded trimethoprim resistance hybridized with whole-cell DNA from Tmps and Tmpr strains. Southern blot analysis of restricted DNA from isogenic Tmps and Tmpr H. influenzae indicated that acquisition of trimethoprim resistance involved a rearrangement or change in nucleotide sequence. Hybridization was not seen with DNA derived from Tmpr E. coli containing dihydrofolate reductase I, II, and III genes or with Tmpr Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Pseudomonas cepacia. Southern hybridization with 12 multiply resistant encapsulated H. influenzae strains confirmed that the trimethoprim resistance gene was chromosomally mediated. Dihydrofolate reductase activity was significantly greater in cell sonicate supernatants of Tmpr strains in comparison with isogenic Tmps recipients. Differences were not found in the trimethoprim inhibition profile of dihydrofolate reductase activity in Tmps and Tmpr strains. We conclude that the mechanism of trimethoprim resistance in H. influenzae is overproduction of chromosomally located dihydrofolate reductase.
TI  - Determination of the structure of the Escherichia coli K100 capsular polysaccharide, cross-reactive with the capsule from type b Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The structure of the Escherichia coli K100 capsular polysaccharide, cross-reactive with that from type b Haemophilus influenzae, was determined by using a combination of chemical and spectroscopic techniques. The structure of the K100 repeating unit was found to be----3)-beta-D-Ribf-(1----2)-D-ribitol-5-(PO4----. The K100 polysaccharide is thus identical in composition to, but different in linkage from, the H. influenzae type b capsular polysaccharide, which has beta-D-Ribf-(1----1)-D-ribitol linkages.
TI  - A survey of clinical experience with ciprofloxacin, a new quinolone antimicrobial.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin is a new quinolone antimicrobial agent with activity against a broad spectrum of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci. The efficacy and safety results of 80 clinical studies of the oral form of ciprofloxacin are reported. Drug safety was assessed in 2236 courses in 2203 adult patients treated primarily in the United States. Data from 1676 courses were suitable for analysis of drug efficacy. The unit dose for most patients ranged from 250 mg to 750 mg (median, 500 mg), usually given every 12 hours. The duration of treatment ranged from 3 to 231 days (median, 10 days). Predominant among 1722 infections were those of the urinary tract (43%), skin structures (29%), and respiratory tract (19%); the remainder were bone and joint infections (5%), bacteremias (2%), and intra-abdominal (1%), gastrointestinal (1%), and pelvic infections (less than 1%). Signs and symptoms of infection resolved in 79% of all cases; a further 15% improved, and 5% failed to improve. Pathogens were eradicated in 89% of urinary tract infections and persisted in 5%; 80% of patients still had sterile urine at the 3-to 6-week follow-up. In 81% of nonurinary tract infections, pathogens were eradicated; they persisted in 11%, and superinfection occurred in less than 5%. After treatment, 89% of the 2253 causative organisms were eradicated and 2% were reduced to clinically insignificant counts; 8% persisted. Of 411 isolates of P. aeruginosa, 77% were eradicated, as were 97% of 421 Escherichia coli and 80% of 248 Staphylococcus aureus isolates. Also eradicated were 95% of 166 Klebsiella, 96% of 139 Proteus mirabilis, 100% of 20 other Proteus, 94% of 123 Enterobacter, 100% of 68 Haemophilus influenzae, 96% of 49 Citrobacter, 89% of 45 Serratia, 95% of 41 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 91% of 43 Salmonella, 100% of 38 Morganella morganii, and 100% of 35 Providencia isolates. Adverse reactions were judged probably or possibly drug-related in 14.8% of courses; drug treatment had to be stopped prematurely in 3.5%. The most frequent reactions were gastrointestinal complaints (chiefly nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting), metabolic disorders (elevated SGOT, SGPT, serum creatinine, or blood urea nitrogen), and nervous system effects (dizziness, light-headedness, restlessness, tremor, and headache). Crystalluria, judged to be related to ciprofloxacin, occurred in two patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro susceptibilities of common pediatric pathogens to LY163892.
AB  - LY163892 is a carbacephem antibiotic for oral administration with an antibacterial spectrum similar to that of cefaclor and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. It has greater stability than cefaclor and greater activity against beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli. LY163892 is less active than amoxicillin against streptococci and less active than amoxicillin-clavulanic acid against Branhamella catarrhalis but comparable against other pathogens.
TI  - Enoxacin: in-vitro and animal evaluation as a parenteral and oral agent against hospital bacterial isolates.
AB  - Enoxacin was evaluated in in-vitro tests and in studies of effectiveness and blood concentrations in the mouse. Enoxacin was active against both susceptible and multiresistant hospital isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and staphylococci. Less susceptible were streptococci and anaerobes. Of nine quinolones tested, only norfloxacin was equivalent in vitro. The MBCs of enoxacin were one- to twofold greater than the MICs, and enoxacin was rapidly bactericidal. No single-step resistant mutants could be detected at 10 mg/l against large inocula and six to 11 steps were required for selection of resistant clones. In systemic mouse infections, enoxacin was effective in a single oral or subcutaneous dose against one strain each of Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia rettgeri and Ps. aeruginosa, and two Staphylococcus aureus strains. Single oral and subcutaneous enoxacin doses (50 mg/kg) gave peak mouse blood levels of 4.9 and 9.5 mg/l and an elimination half-life of 1.8 h.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of trospectomycin (U-63366F), a novel spectinomycin analog.
AB  - Trospectomycin (U-63366F) is a novel spectinomycin analog with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. The in vitro activity of this analog was compared with that of spectinomycin and other reference antibiotics against 411 clinical isolates of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. MICs were determined by agar or broth dilution methods. The stability of trospectomycin in the presence of an enzyme extract derived from spectinomycin-resistant Escherichia coli was determined. Trospectomycin was more active than spectinomycin (4- to 32-fold) against strains of numerous bacterial species, including staphylococci, streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Proteus species, Bacteroides species, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium species, and Chlamydia trachomatis. Trospectomycin demonstrated a moderate level of activity (comparable to that of spectinomycin) for most species of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested and was generally cross resistant with spectinomycin. Trospectomycin was susceptible to inactivation by crude enzyme preparations from spectinomycin-inactivating strains of E. coli. Trospectomycin inhibited a variety of clinically important organisms, including agents of sexually transmitted diseases and pelvic inflammatory disease. Clinical studies with this novel aminocyclitol antibiotic are in progress.
TI  - Cloning of genes encoding a 15,000-dalton peptidoglycan-associated outer membrane lipoprotein and an antigenically related 15,000-dalton protein from Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - We have cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli a gene encoding a 15,000-apparent-molecular-weight peptidoglycan-associated outer membrane lipoprotein (PAL) of Haemophilus influenzae. The nucleotide sequence of this gene encodes an open reading frame of 153 codons with a predicted mature protein of 134 amino acids. The amino acid composition and sequence of the predicted mature protein agree with the chemically determined composition and partial amino acid sequence of PAL purified from H. influenzae outer membranes. We have also identified a second gene from H. influenzae that encodes a second 15,000-apparent-molecular-weight protein which is recognized by antiserum against PAL. This protein has been shown to be a lipoprotein. The nucleotide sequence of this gene encodes an open reading frame of 154 codons with a predicted mature protein of 136 amino acids and has limited sequence homology with that of the gene encoding PAL. Southern hybridization analysis indicates that both genes exist as single copies in H. influenzae chromosomal DNA. Both genes encode polypeptides which have amino-terminal sequences similar to those of reported membrane signal peptides and are associated primarily with the outer membrane when expressed in E. coli.
TI  - A broad-spectrum probe for molecular epidemiology of bacteria: ribosomal RNA.
AB  - We investigated the use of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) as a probe for molecular epidemiology of bacterial pathogens. The chromosomal DNA of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas cepacia, and nontypable Haemophilus influenzae was digested with EcoRI. Agarose gel electrophoresis, Southern blotting, and hybridization by 32P-labeled rRNA revealed eight to 13 bands. The P. cepacia and H. influenzae banding patterns, observed by using an E. coli rRNA probe, were identical to those produced with homologous rRNA probes. Polymorphism of several hybridization bands distinguished all E. coli isolates, nine of 10 H. influenzae isolates, and seven of eight P. cepacia isolates. Two to four bands were common to all P. cepacia and E. coli isolates. The banding patterns of H. influenzae isolates cultured from the trachea and blood of an infant and from the mother's cervix were identical. These data demonstrate that this method is a widely applicable system for determining the molecular epidemiology of genetically diverse gram-negative organisms.
TI  - A-61827 (A-60969), a new fluoronaphthyridine with activity against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - A-61827 (A-60969 is the hydrochloric salt of A-61827) is a new aryl-fluoronaphthyridine which is active against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The MICs of A-61827 for 90% of strains (MIC90) of staphylococci and streptococci were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml and were generally 1 to 4 twofold dilutions less than those of ciprofloxacin for these bacteria. The MIC90S of A-61827 for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were also less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. Ciprofloxacin was 1 to 3 twofold dilutions more active than A-61827 against these gram-negative bacteria. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Campylobacter jejuni, and Haemophilus influenzae were susceptible to less than 0.06 microgram of A-61827 per ml. The MIC90 of A-61827 for Legionella pneumophila was 0.25 microgram/ml. A-61827 was as potent or 1 to 2 twofold dilutions more potent than ciprofloxacin against these organisms. The MIC90 of A-61827 for all anaerobic bacteria was less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml compared with less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. In mouse protection tests, A-61827 was as active as ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, P. aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium and 5 to 10 times more active than ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. A-61827 was as active as ciprofloxacin against P. aeruginosa in a mouse pyelonephritis model and more active than ciprofloxacin and metronidazole in a mouse Bacteroides fragilis abscess model. After oral administration of 100 mg/kg to mice, the peak concentrations of A-61827 and ciprofloxacin in serum were 2.3 and 2.4 micrograms/ml and the half-lives in serum were 3.9 and 1.2 h, respectively.
TI  - Comparable evaluation of orally active beta-lactam compounds in ampicillin-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative rods: role of beta-lactamases on resistance.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of the recently developed cephems cefixime and cefetamet-pivoxyl was evaluated in 408 gram-positive and gram-negative rods, all isolated recently from clinical specimens, and compared to that of other orally active agents such as ampicillin, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime-axetil and to ceftriaxone. With regard to ampicillin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae ceftriaxone proved to be the most active agent, followed by cefixime and cefetamet, whereas cefuroxime was less active. Cefaclor and amoxycillin + claculanic acid were active against ampicillin-resistant Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus ssp. isolates. All beta-lactam compounds exhibited poor activity against Acinetobacter anitratus isolates, but were highly active against Haemophilus influenzae with the exception of cefaclor. Both cefixime and cefetamet were poorly active against Staphylococcus aureus, but highly active against beta-hemolytic streptococci. Moreover, both compounds remained unaffected by the production of plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases such as the TEM or OXA enzymes. Resistance to both agents was observed in Enterobacteriaceae that produced large amounts of chromosomally mediated enzymes; their affinity to the class I enzyme from Enterobacter cloacae was somewhat lower than that of other third-generation cephalosporins. However, in contrast with these agents breakdown of cefixime and cefetamet by a class IIIa enzyme form Proteus vulgaris was marginal. In methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates there was a complete cross-resistance between all beta-lactam compounds included in this study.
TI  - BMY-28100, a new oral cephalosporin: antimicrobial activity against nearly 7,000  recent clinical isolates, comparative potency with other oral agents, and activity against beta-lactamase producing isolates.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of BMY-28100 was tested against approximately 7,000 bacterial pathogens in a multicenter, multiphased collaborative investigation. The BMY-28100 spectrum and antimicrobial potency was most similar to that of cefaclor and superior to that of cephalexin among currently available cephalosporins. Species that had greater than or equal to 90% of clinical strains inhibited by BMY-28100 (less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml) were: Citrobacter diversus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus supp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. bovis, serogroup C and G streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes and gm-positive anaerobes. BMY-28100 inhibited 9% more of the 6286 fresh clinical isolates at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml than cefaclor at the same concentration. BMY-28100 was generally bactericidal, but MICs for some species were markedly increased when an inoculum concentration of 10(7) CFU/ml was used. Strains producing plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (TEM, OXA, SHV, HMS) were susceptible to BMY-28100, cefaclor, and cefuroxime. BMY-28100 was less active against strains producing chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases (Types I and IV). BMY-28100 was not hydrolyzed significantly by the tested plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but was destroyed by Type I cephalosporinases and Klebsiella K1 enzymes.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of Haemophilus influenzae outer membrane protein P6.
AB  - P6, a 16,600-dalton protein present in the outer membranes of both typeable and nontypeable strains, may be an important antigen in immunity to Haemophilus influenzae. The gene encoding P6 of a nontypeable strain of H. influenzae was cloned by using bacteriophage lambda gt11. Four recombinant phages were detected by screening plaques with monoclonal antibodies and a polyclonal antiserum. One recombinant phage, clone O, produced a full-length gene product which was expressed at a high yield. The DNA insert contained within this phage was cloned into the plasmid vector pUC18 to create the recombinant plasmid pBUD1. An Escherichia coli transformant containing this plasmid produced a protein which had an apparent molecular weight identical to that of H. influenzae P6, as determined by Western blot (immunoblot) analyses. Expression of the P6 polypeptide by both clone 0 and the transformant was independent of induction of the lac operon by isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, suggesting that transcription was from the promoter of the P6 gene. Immunoelectron microscopy using a monoclonal antibody with specificity for a P6 surface epitope detected the presence of P6 on the surface of the transformant. The insert in pBUD1 was cut down in size to approximately 800 base pairs. The resultant plasmid, pBUD5, also coded for a full-length gene product. DNA sequence analysis revealed that the P6 gene contains transcriptional and translational sequences resembling those recognized in E. coli and a signal sequence characteristic of procaryotic membrane proteins. In addition, the carboxy terminus of this signal sequence shares homology with a common sequence found in bacterial lipoproteins, suggesting that P6 is a lipoprotein. Posttranslational proteolytic cleavage of the signal sequence would result in a protein composed of 134 amino acids.
TI  - Bacteriological and clinical evaluation of cefotetan in the treatment of severe infections in hospitalized patients.
AB  - The authors studied 302 hospitalized patients, 164 males and 138 females aged 15-88 years (average 66 years), with severe infections. Cefotetan was administered to 278 of them at the dose of 1 or 2 g, b.i.d. or a single daily dose i.m. Other patients [24] were treated with a continuous intravenous infusion of cefotetan (3 g daily in 5% dextrose). Of these patients 121 were treated for urinary tract infections (UTI); 114 for respiratory tract infections (RTI); 41 for liver biliary duct infections (BDI); 17 for skin or skin structure infections (SKI); 6 for fever of unknown origin and 3 for sepsis. The following Gram-positive organisms [156] were isolated: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus group D; and the following Gram-negative organisms [122]: Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia spp., Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The overall eradication rate for Gram-positive organisms was 74% and for Gram-negative organisms it was 88%. The clinical response was satisfactory in 87.7% of patients (specifically, cefotetan was effective in 90% of UTI, 84.2% of RTI, 97.5% of BDI and 82.3% of SKI). The drug was well tolerated and side-effects (such as skin rash, diarrhoea, purpura and pain at the site of injection) occurred in only 4% of patients treated with cefotetan. In conclusion, cefotetan appears to be safe and highly effective for the treatment of severe infections in hospitalized patients.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - Ceftriaxone in the treatment of bacterial meningitis in adults.
AB  - Twenty-six adults with acute bacterial meningitis were enrolled in an open randomized comparative study. The organisms isolated from CSF were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi. 13 patients (group A) were treated once daily with intravenous ceftriaxone (Rocephin). The 13 patients in group B received ampicillin or ampicillin plus chloramphenicol in 4 doses/day. The mean duration of therapy in groups A and B was 9.9 and 12.3 days, respectively. This difference in the duration of therapy was statistically significant. All patients from group A showed clinical improvement and all were bacteriologically cured. In group B only 12 patients were clinically and bacteriologically cured; 1 patient had to be withdrawn from the therapy because CSF culture remained positive after 48 h of therapy. Ceftriaxone was well tolerated in all patients; ampicillin or ampicillin plus chloramphenicol were associated with diarrhea and skin rash in 6 patients.
TI  - Community-acquired pneumonia: etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
AB  - Pneumonia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. A variety of conditions that damage the airways and weaken host defense mechanisms increase the susceptibility of the individual to bacterial colonization of the pulmonary tree. Because the clinician frequently cannot determine the etiologic agent, pneumonia is often treated empirically. Cefonicid, a long-acting cephalosporin, is a useful and cost-effective antibiotic that is active against many of the common pathogens that cause community-acquired pneumonia, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. It is also active against less common community-acquired pathogens, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and some anaerobic mouth flora. Erythromycin is useful when Mycoplasma or Legionella species are suspected. Cefonicid's demonstrated safety and efficacy, its low cost, and its long half-life, permitting once-daily dosing, make this antibiotic an ideal parenteral choice for empiric therapy of community-acquired pneumonia.
TI  - Changes in expression of bacterial surface antigens induced by antibiotics and their influence on host defenses.
AB  - Concomitant with the discovery that a number of antibiotics were able to induce profound morphological changes (increased septation, thickened walls, filamentation) at low concentrations their ability to inhibit bacterial protein/polysaccharide synthesis was determined. In particular toxin and extracellular enzyme biosynthesis could be repressed by the lincosamines, fusidic acid, erythromycin and streptomycin in Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Several of these exoproducts act as antigens associated with microbial virulence and are therefore of importance in pathogenicity. Likewise structural components such as fimbriae in Escherichia coli, M protein in Streptococcus pyogenes, protein A in Staphylococcus aureus and capsule in Bacteroides fragilis and Haemophilus influenzae were not synthesised when the producer bacteria were grown in low concentrations of antibiotic. These products, through their importance as impedins of opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis by white blood cells, are important determinants in the host-parasite relationship. By their loss during drug exposure, potentiation of opsonophagocytosis occurred leading to more rapid killing of the pathogen. The immunogenicity of the antibiotic-damaged bacteria was also changed under these circumstances.
TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of the gene encoding the heat-modifiable major outer membrane protein of Haemophilus influenzae type b.
AB  - One major outer membrane protein (P1) of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), with an apparent molecular weight of 34,000 (34K) as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), has been shown to be heat modifiable. After heating at 100 degrees C for 5 min in 2% SDS, the P1 protein exhibits an apparent molecular weight of 49,000 (49K) in SDS-PAGE. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) reactive with P1 bound to the surface of Hib, and one of these MAbs had a protective effect against the development of Hib bacteremia in an animal model for invasive Hib disease. A 6-kilobase Hib DNA insert containing the gene encoding this P1 protein was cloned into Escherichia coli by using the gamma gt11 expression vector. Recombinant phage expressing P1 were identified by screening phage plaques with a MAb directed against the P1 protein. Expression of the P1 protein by an E. coli lysogen carrying the recombinant phage was independent of both vegetative phage growth and induction of lacZ gene-directed transcription of the Hib DNA insert. The Hib DNA insert encoding the P1 protein was subcloned into the plasmid vector pBR322, and a transformant containing the recombinant plasmid pFRG100 was identified with the P1 protein-directed MAb in a colony blot-radioimmunoassay. Western blot (immunoblot) analysis determined that the recombinant P1 protein possessed heat-modifiability characteristics identical to those of the native Hib protein. The P1 protein was expressed on the surface of both the E. coli lysogen containing the recombinant phage and the E. coli transformant containing pFRG100. Western blot analysis of acute- and convalescent-phase sera from infants with Hib meningitis showed that antibodies in the convalescent-phase sera recognized the P1 protein expressed by the E. coli transformant containing pFRG100. The availability of this cloned Hib DNA insert encoding the Hib P1 protein and the expression of this protein on the surface of recombinant E. coli should facilitate the investigation of P1 for both its vaccinogenic potential and its functional role in the outer membrane of Hib.
TI  - Spectrum and mode of action of azithromycin (CP-62,993), a new 15-membered-ring macrolide with improved potency against gram-negative organisms.
AB  - The macrolide antibiotic azithromycin (CP-62,993; 9-deoxo-9a-methyl-9a-aza-9a-homoerythromycin A; also designated XZ-450 [Pliva Pharmaceuticals, Zagreb, Yugoslavia]) showed a significant improvement in potency against gram-negative organisms compared with erythromycin while retaining the classic erythromycin spectrum. It was up to four times more potent than erythromycin against Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae and twofold more potent against Branhamella catarrhalis, Campylobacter species, and Legionella species. It had activity similar to that of erythromycin against Chlamydia spp. Azithromycin was significantly more potent versus many genera of the family Enterobacteriaceae; its MIC for 90% of strains of Escherichia, Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia was less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 16 to 128 micrograms/ml for erythromycin. Azithromycin inhibited the majority of gram-positive organisms at less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. It displayed cross-resistance to erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus and Streptococcus isolates. It had moderate activity against Bacteroides fragilis and was comparable to erythromycin against other anaerobic species. Azithromycin also demonstrated improved bactericidal activity in comparison with erythromycin. The mechanism of action of azithromycin was similar to that of erythromycin since azithromycin competed effectively for [14C]erythromycin ribosomebinding sites.
TI  - SIGNAL blood culture system for detection of bacteremia in neonates.
AB  - In the SIGNAL (Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, United Kingdom) blood culture system, gas produced by bacterial metabolism displaces medium from the culture bottle into an upper reservoir via a hollow needle. Displacement of media may provide a visual indication of the presence of both aerobic and anaerobic organisms in a single medium. The single-bottle SIGNAL system was compared with paired BACTEC 16B and 7D (Johnston Laboratories, Inc., Towson, Md.) radiometric system bottles by using bacterial inocula and conditions which simulated those found in neonatal and pediatric populations. The single SIGNAL bottle was a good as the combined BACTEC media for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, but was slower for Candida spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, group B streptococci, alpha-streptococci, and pneumococci. The SIGNAL system failed to detect four of five isolates of Neisseria meningitidis and four of eight anaerobic organisms. The SIGNAL system is not suitable for neonatal blood cultures at its present state of development.
TI  - Disk diffusion susceptibility testing and broth microdilution quality control guidelines for BMY-28100, a new orally administered cephalosporin.
AB  - The BMY-28100 30-micrograms-disk test was evaluated by using 615 clinical isolates. Regression analyses and error rates were determined, leading to the recommendation of greater than or equal to 18-mm zone diameters (MIC correlate, greater than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml) for susceptibility and less than or equal to 14-mm zone diameters (MIC correlate, greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml) for resistance. Nearly all false-susceptible disk test results were among the Providencia spp. and the beta-lactamase-positive Haemophilus influenzae strains. Susceptibility disk test results for these species should be interpreted with caution. The following broth microdilution MIC quality control guidelines were determined from results of a multilaboratory trial: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, 1.0 to 4.0 micrograms/ml; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, 4.0 to 16 micrograms/ml; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, 0.25 to 1.0 microgram/ml; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, greater than 32 micrograms/ml.
TI  - In vitro activity of a new broad spectrum, beta-lactamase-stable oral cephalosporin, cefixime.
AB  - Cefixime is a new orally absorbed iminomethoxy, aminothiazolyl cephalosporin. It  inhibits the majority, 90%, of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. It inhibits 90% of the other members of the Enterobacteriaceae at concentrations less than 1 microgram/ml, with the exception of some strains of Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii and Morganella morganii, Cefixime does not inhibit enterococci, Listeria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Bacteroides spp. or staphylococci. In general, cefixime has in vitro activity superior to cephalexin, cephradine, cefadroxil and cefaclor against all bacteria with the exception of staphylococci. Cefixime is not destroyed by most of the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases and its activity is not reduced by serum, blood or urine. Cefixime overall has excellent in vitro activity against the commonly encountered respiratory and urinary tract pathogens.
TI  - [Clinical studies on flomoxef in respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Flomoxef (FMOX, 6315-S) is a new oxacephem with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. We used FMOX for treatment of 13 patients with respiratory tract infections including 4 cases of pneumonia, 5 of lung abscess and 4 of exacerbation of the chronic airway diseases. FMOX showed excellent in vitro antimicrobial activities against clinical isolates including 4 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and each one strain of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Clinical responses were excellent in 3 cases, good in 7 and fair or poor in 3. No side effect was observed, but abnormal laboratory findings caused by FMOX administration were found in 2 cases; hypertransaminasemia and eosinophilia. However, neither of them was severe. From the above results, it is considered that FMOX will be useful for treatment of patients with respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Recovery of beta-lactamase producing bacteria in pediatric infections.
AB  - The presence of beta-lactamase producing bacteria (beta LPB) was investigated in  specimens obtained from 1469 children who presented with infections of the skin and soft tissue (648), upper respiratory tract (514), pulmonary sites (137), surgical sites (113), and other (57). Of 4989 bacterial isolates recovered, 910 (18%) were beta LPB, 492 (54%) aerobes, and 418 (46%) anaerobes. The beta LPB were recovered in 751 (51%) of the children. The most frequently recovered beta LPB was Staphylococcus aureus, which was recovered in 356 (47%) patients. Most isolates were recovered from patients with skin and soft-tissue infections (68% of patients), upper respiratory tract infections (49%), and pulmonary infections (35%). Bacteroides fragilis group was isolated in 35% of patients with beta LPB, mostly from surgical infections (98% of patients), pulmonary infections (36%), skin and soft-tissue infections (25%), and upper respiratory tract infections (20%). Twenty-five percent of the Bacteroides melaninogenicus group produced beta-lactamase. These organisms were recovered in 15% of patients with beta LPB. They were recovered in upper respiratory tract infections (38% of patients), pulmonary infections (22%), and skin and soft-tissue infections (7%). Other beta LPB were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8% of total patients with beta LPB), Escherichia coli (4%), Bacteroides oralis (3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), Haemophilus influenzae (2%), Proteus (1%), and Branhamella catarrhalis (1%). The role of beta LPB in the failure of penicillin to eradicate many of the infections is discussed.
TI  - Haemophilus influenzae immunoglobulin A1 protease genes: cloning by plasmid integration-excision, comparative analyses, and localization of secretion determinants.
AB  - Many bacteria which establish infections after invasion at human mucosal surfaces produce enzymes which cleave immunoglobulin A (IgA), the primary immunoglobulin involved with protection at these sites. Bacterial species such as Haemophilus influenzae which produce IgA1 proteases secrete this enzyme into their environment. However, when the gene encoding this protein was isolated from H. influenzae serotype d and introduced into Escherichia coli, the activity was not secreted into the medium but was localized in the periplasmic space. In this study, the IgA1 protease gene (iga) from an H. influenzae serotype c strain was isolated and the gene from the serotype d strain was reisolated. The IgA1 proteases produced in E. coli from these genes were secreted into the growth medium. A sequence linked to the carboxyl terminus of the iga gene but not present in the original clone was shown to be necessary to achieve normal secretion. Tn5 mutagenesis of the additional carboxyl-terminal region was used to define a 75- to 100-kilodalton coding region required for complete secretion of IgA1 protease but nonessential for protease activity. The iga genes were isolated by a plasmid integration-excision procedure. In this method a derivative of plasmid pBR322 containing a portion of the protease gene and the kanamycin resistance determinant of Tn5 was introduced into H. influenzae by transformation. The kanamycin resistance gene was expressed in H. influenzae, but since pBR322 derivatives are unable to replicate in this organism, kanamycin-resistant transformants arose by integration of the plasmid into the Haemophilus chromosome by homologous recombination. The plasmid, together with the adjoining DNA encoding IgA1 protease, was then excised from the chromosome with DNA restriction enzymes, religated, and reintroduced into E. coli. Comparisons between the H. influenzae protease genes were initiated which are useful in locating functional domains of these enzymes.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetics and clinical effects of aspoxicillin in pediatric patients].
AB  - Since the efficacy and the safety of aspoxicillin (ASPC, TA-058) have been established on adult patients and the need of ASPC use on pediatric patients was anticipated, we performed a 16 center study on the clinical utility of ASPC in pediatric patients. 1. Pharmacokinetics ASPC was intravenously administered to 45 patients at a dose of 10, 20 or 40 mg/kg by one shot. Serum concentrations of ASPC were dependent of dose levels, and maximum levels of 58.4-230.8 micrograms/ml and half-lives (beta) of 1.08-1.16 hours were observed. Urinary recovery rates were 62.7-67.2% in 6 hours. Results obtained upon drip infusions (0.5-1 hour) were similar to one shot injections. 2. Clinical results (1) Clinical effectiveness Of 318 evaluable patients including 175 boys and 143 girls, 18.2% were nurslings and 61% were young children under 4 years of age. One hundred eighty six patients from whom causative organisms were isolated were classified as A group. Among them were 5 patients suffered with sepsis, but the ASPC treatment eradicated all the bacteria but Salmonella java in 1 case. All of 4 patients with meningitis were cured and all causative organisms (3 cases with Haemophilus influenzae and 1 case with Gram-positive coccus) were eradicated. Cure rates were 90% for 130 patients with respiratory tract infection, 88.6% for 35 with urinary tract infection, 85.7% for 7 with skin soft tissue infection and 89.8% for all the A group patients. Meanwhile, no causative organisms were isolated from 132 patients (B group patients) but cure rate of 91.7% was obtained for this group. No statistical difference was observed between A and B groups. For all the patients (318), the cure rate was 90.6%. (2) Bacteriological effects Of 63 Gram-positive bacteria isolated as pathogens, 58 strains were eradicated. Of 117 Gram-negative bacterial, 101 were eradicated. The eradication rate on all 180 strains was 88.3%. Overall, ASPC showed excellent effects against Streptococcus. Among strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 18 of 20 strains were eradicated. Of 59 strains of H. influenzae, 52 were eradicated and 3 decreased. Among strains of Escherichia coli, 25 of 28 strains were eradicated. Of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2 strains were decreased and one was unchanged. (3) ASPC was effective in 93.3% of 30 patients with serious infections and 79.2% of 72 patients with underlying diseases. Cure rates for patients with and without underlying disease were significantly different statistically (chi 2: P less than 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Pharmacokinetics and bacteriological efficacy of ticarcillin-clavulanic acid (timentin) in experimental Escherichia coli K-1 and Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics and bacteriological efficacy of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid administered individually or in combination were assessed in rabbits with experimental Escherichia coli K-1 and Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis. The mean penetrations into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of infected animals after a single dose of ticarcillin-clavulanic acid were approximately 11 and 28% for ticarcillin and clavulanic acid, respectively. In continuous-infusion experiments, the mean penetrations into CSF were 14.6 and 35% for ticarcillin and clavulanic acid, respectively, in rabbits with E. coli meningitis and 6.1 and 24%, respectively, in rabbits with H. influenzae meningitis. In animals that received a continuous infusion of the two drugs alone or in combination, the median CSF bactericidal titers for E. coli were less than 1:2, less than 1:2, and 1:2 for ticarcillin, clavulanic acid, and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, respectively, and for H. influenzae the titers were less than 1:2, less than 1:2, and 1:4, respectively. The addition of clavulanic acid potentiated significantly the bacteriological efficacy of ticarcillin in reducing the number of bacteria in CSF of infected rabbits. Additional studies in animals and humans are required before recommendations can be made regarding the use of ticarcillin-clavulanic acid for treatment of meningitis.
TI  - Cephalosporin, carbapenem, and monobactam antibiotics.
AB  - Cephalosporin and related antibiotics are highly effective bactericidal agents of relatively low toxicity. The spectrum of activity varies with the drug but is usually broad. The first-generation cephalosporins, and especially cefazolin, are most active against sensitive staphylococci and streptococci. Most second-generation (except cefoxitin) and third-generation cephalosporins show substantial activity against Haemophilus influenzae. All cephalosporins (except cefsulodin) are active against Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis, whereas only the third-generation agents have pronounced activity against the other Enterobacteriaceae. Imipenem (a carbapenem) is active against essentially all pathogenic organisms, but aztreonam (a monobactam) is active against only aerobic gram-negative bacilli. Advantages associated with some of the new cephalosporins are once-daily administration and high cerebrospinal fluid levels. With the development of new cephalosporins, however, new toxicities have become apparent, and superinfections and induction of resistance have become greater problems. The cephalosporins are among the most expensive antibiotics in use today; thus, use of these expensive agents must be justified by lower toxicity, greater efficacy, or both in comparison with drugs of more reasonable cost.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinical bacterial isolates to aztreonam].
AB  - In vitro activities of 7 antimicrobial agents against organisms (474 strains) isolated from patients with various infections in Ehime University Hospital from May to July 1986 were investigated. Summarized results are as follows: 1. Aztreonam (AZT) showed potent activities against Escherichia coli, Citrobacter sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae. 2. Antimicrobial activities of AZT were especially superior against Proteus sp. to the third generation cephem antibiotics. 3. Enterobacter sp. seemed more susceptible to AZT than to cephem antibiotics, but minimum inhibitory concentrations of AZT against may isolates of Enterobacter sp. were in wide ranges.
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1985)].
AB  - It has been more than 4 years since third-generation cephems were introduced into clinical practice. The range of our drug selection definitely tends to increase, because we today have more antibiotics with wider spectrum, antibiotics with strong activities only against Gram-negative strains, such as monobactams, and those with tremendously high activities such as quinolone carboxylic acid derivatives, in comparison to those we had in the past. Among isolates obtained mainly from sputa of 567 patients with lower respiratory tract infections at 16 institutions throughout Japan between September of 1985 and March of 1986, 741 strains were determined to be causative organisms. MIC's of various antimicrobial agents were determined against 67 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 100 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 199 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 92 strains of non-mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 40 strains of mucoid P. aeruginosa, 29 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 10 strains of Escherichia coli and for 42 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis out of the above 741 strains to determine their drug sensitivities. As for types of lower respiratory tract infections found in 1981--1983, 57.9--64.5% of the infections were chronic respiratory infections; i.e., chronic bronchitis, chronic bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis. These chronic infections, including diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB), were found in 63.1% of lower respiratory tract infections in 1984. Their incidence dropped to 54.0% in 1985, even though DPB was included; i.e., the incidence of chronic bronchiolitis was 5.5%, that of DPB was 7.1%, and that of bronchial asthma associated with lower respiratory tract infections in 1985 was 8.8% which was twice as much as that found in 1981--1984. Although bacterial pneumonia was found in 24.8% of all the cases in 1981, its incidence was reduced to 11.0% in 1983, 15.1% in 1984, and 17.6% in 1985. This reduction seemed to have resulted from gradual decreases in the occurrence of bacterial pneumonia among the young population. As with usual years, a high incidence rate in a total lower respiratory tract infections in 1985 was found among older patients; namely, 73.5% was at the age of 50 or over (417/567). Next, we determined relationships between clinical isolates and isolates from respiratory infections, including chronic bronchitis, chronic bronchiolitis, bronchiectasis and DPB. H. influenzae was isolated from 50.5% of patients with these infections in 1981; however, the detection rate decreased by about 20% to 29.7% in 1985. P. aeruginosa was consistently isolated, between 24.1% and 30.4% every year.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro and in vivo evaluations of BMY-28100, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - A new semisynthetic oral cephalosporin, BMY-28100, was evaluated for in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities in comparison with cefaclor and cephalexin. BMY-28100 showed in vitro activity 3- and 10-fold more potent than that of cefaclor against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, respectively. BMY-28100 was slightly better than cefaclor and about 4 times more active than cephalexin against Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were comparably susceptible to BMY-28100 and cefaclor. The bactericidal activity of BMY-28100 against S. aureus, E. coli and P. mirabilis was equal to or twice as high as MIC value, which was similar to that of cefaclor. The stability of BMY-28100 against penicillinases was nearly comparable to that of cefaclor, whereas cefaclor was somewhat unstable to cephalosporinases. BMY-28100 was about twice as active as cefaclor against three Gram-positive bacterial infections. BMY-28100 was also more potent against infections of H. influenzae and P. mirabilis, but slightly less active against E. coli Juhl than cefaclor. Blood level parameters of BMY-28100 were significantly superior to those of cefaclor and slightly better than cephalexin in mice and rats. The urinary recovery of BMY-28100 was somewhat higher and comparable to that of cefaclor and cephalexin, respectively. BMY-28100 was more stable than cefaclor in human and calf sera at 37 degrees C.
TI  - [Clinical studies of flomoxef in the pediatric field].
AB  - Flomoxef (FMOX, 6315-S) was evaluated pharmacologically and clinically in its application to bacterial infections in children. 1. Pharmacokinetics: A bullous intravenous injection of FMOX at 20 mg/kg body weight gave a peak serum concentration of 114.6 +/- 34.4 micrograms/ml in 1 minute after the injection and T1/2 of beta-phase was 0.86 +/- 0.15 hours. 2. Bacteriological effectiveness: MIC of FMOX against Staphylococcus aureus except resistant strains (10(6) cells/ml) was below 0.39 micrograms/ml and against Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (10(6) cells/ml) were below 0.78 microgram/ml. 3. Clinical effectiveness: Clinical effectiveness of FMOX was excellent in 14 cases, good in 2 cases and fairly good in 1 case among 17 cases of bacterial infections examined. An increase in eosinophilic leukocytes was observed in 1 case but no other clinical adverse effects were detected. These findings indicate that FMOX is a useful and safe antibiotic as a first choice against bacterial infections in children.
TI  - [Bacteriological and clinical studies of flomoxef in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Bacteriological and clinical studies with flomoxef (FMOX, 6315-S), a new oxacephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics and the results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. The antimicrobial activity of FMOX against clinically isolated organisms was determined. FMOX had a good antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae and especially against Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin resistant S. aureus). 2. Mean serum concentrations of FMOX following intravenous bolus injection of 20 and 40 mg/kg (in 7 and 4 cases, respectively) were 35.3 and 77.7 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes after administration with mean serum half-lives (T1/2) of 0.75 and 0.95 hours and mean urinary recovery rates up to 6 hours after administration were 71.9 and 65.1%, respectively. 3. Twenty-five pediatric patients (19 cases of pneumonia, 1 case of pyothorax and 5 cases of urinary tract infection) were treated with FMOX in doses ranging from 50 to 138 mg/kg divided into 3 or 4 times a day. The rate of clinical effectiveness was 100% and the bacterial elimination rate was 90.6%. 4. No adverse reactions were observed. Abnormal laboratory findings were eosinophilia in 1, thrombocytosis in 2 and slight elevations of GOT and GPT in 3 patients. These results indicate the usefulness and the safety of FMOX in the treatment of bacterial infections in the pediatric field.
TI  - [The study of flomoxef in the pediatric field].
AB  - Flomoxef (FMOX; 6315-S), a new synthetic oxacephem antibiotic, was studied in the pediatric field and pharmacokinetic and clinical results obtained were summarized below. 1. The activity of FMOX against Staphylococcus aureus isolated from clinical patients, including latamoxef resistant strains was very high and MIC was approximately less than or equal to 0.39 microgram/ml. This MIC value was lower than other cephem antibiotics such as cefotaxime, cefotiam, cefmetazole, cefamandole. The distribution of MIC's of FMOX against Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. ranged from 0.05 to 0.78 microgram/ml and from 0.05 to 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. 2. Serum concentrations of FMOX after dosages of 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg with 1 hour intravenous drip infusion were 21.5-27.5 micrograms/ml, 6.00-7.81 micrograms/ml, 0.37-0.59 micrograms/ml at 1, 2, 5 hours after administration, respectively, and T1/2(beta) were 0.61-0.83 hour. Serum concentrations after one shot intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg FMOX were 56.7-90.2 and 0.20-0.26 micrograms/ml at 3-10 minutes and 6 hours after administration, respectively, T1/2(beta) was 1.22 hours and urinary excretion rate was 66.7-69.8% in 6 hours. 3. FMOX was administered to 32 cases (upper and lower respiratory tract infection, and purulent infections) at 3-4 times daily for 4-13 days. In these cases the daily dosage amounted to 41-119 mg/kg. Clinical effectiveness was 97% overall including resistance cases upon other cephem antibiotic treatment. All bacterial species identified including Branhamella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Haemophilus influenzae were eradicated upon the treatment with FMOX. 4. Only 3 cases of soft stool, 1 case of elevated GOT and GPT, and 1 case of elevated GPT were observed, and all of these adverse reactions were normalized after the completion of treatment.

AB  - Bacillus amyloliquefaciens cells were found to contain an exonuclease which catalyzes the sequential hydrolysis of mononucleotides from the 3'-termini of duplex DNA. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity and its molecular weight (as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate) is 29,000. The exonuclease possesses an additional catalytic activity, i.e., 3'-5' exonuclease specific for the RNA strand in an RNA--DNA hybrid duplex (RNase H activity). In terms of physical and catalytic properties the exonuclease of B. amyloliquefaciens is similar to exonucleases III from E. coli and Haemophilus influenzae and can thus be related to the same class of hydrolases, i.e., 3.1.11.2. However, in comparison with exo III from E. coli, the enzyme from B. amyloliquefaciens exhibits a more strict specificity for the structure of the substrate 3'-end.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of T-2588, a new oral cephalosporin, compared with those of other oral beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - T-2588, the pivaloyloxymethyl ester of T-2525, [6R, 7R]-7-[(z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-methoxyiminoacetoamido] -3- [(5-methyl-2H-tetrazol-2-yl)methyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid, is a new oral cephalosporin. T-2525 had a widely expanded antibacterial spectrum against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. T-2525 was more active in vitro than cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Branhamella catarrhalis. Moreover, it exhibited superior in vitro activity against Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. T-2525 was highly stable to various beta-lactamases, which were classified as Richmond and Sykes types Ia, Ib, Ic, III, IV, and Vc. It had high affinities for the lethal (essential) penicillin-binding proteins of Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, and Bacteroides fragilis. T-2588 had excellent therapeutic effect on systemic infections in mice with various species of gram-negative bacteria, including beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of CS-807, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - CS-807 is a new oral prodrug of R-3746, a cephalosporin derivative, with potent in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The susceptibility of about 1,200 clinical isolates to R-3746 was determined by the agar dilution method. Ninety percent or more of pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, indole-positive and indole-negative Proteus spp., Providencia rettgeri, and Haemophilus influenzae were inhibited at concentrations ranging less than or equal to 0.01 to 1.56 micrograms/ml. Furthermore, at a concentration of 3.13 micrograms/ml, 50% or more of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens strains were also inhibited. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Xanthomonas maltophilia were resistant to R-3746. The activity of R-3746 was scarcely influenced by several growth conditions. R-3746 was highly resistant to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases derived from various species of bacteria. Killing-curve studies demonstrated bactericidal activity of R-3746 at concentrations above the MIC. R-3746 showed high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins 1, 3, and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus and 1A, 1Bs, and 3 of Escherichia coli. Systemic infections in mice caused by various pathogens, including beta-lactamase-producing strains, responded well to therapy with oral doses of CS-807.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence comparisons of plasmids pHD131, pJB1, pFA3, and pFA7 and beta-lactamase expression in Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  - The sites of initiation for beta-lactamase mRNA transcription and the nucleotide  sequences of beta-lactamase plasmids derived from Haemophilus and Neisseria species were determined. In N. gonorrhoeae, transcription from plasmid pFA3 was initiated from two sites, one located about 20 base pairs (bp) and the other 210 bp upstream of the beta-lactamase initiating codon, whereas in H. influenzae, transcriptional initiation from plasmid pHD131 occurred at two different sites, approximately 150 and 170 bp upstream of the initiating codon. When these plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli, transcription was initiated at the 150- and 170-bp upstream sites in both plasmids. The nucleotide sequences of both plasmids within the noncoding region upstream of the transcriptional initiation site were identical and, except at two or three nucleotide positions, the sequences were also identical to the corresponding region of Tn3. At one of these positions there is a TA for CG substitution, which correlates in E. coli and Haemophilus sp. with the presence of two strong, overlapping beta-lactamase promoters, initiating transcription at the 150- and 170-bp upstream sites. Over a larger (875-bp) segment comprising most of the sequences of the tnpR and bla genes, the nucleotide sequences of both plasmids were also identical, and although this sequence differed from the corresponding Tn3 sequence at 18 sites, it was identical to that of Tn2, except at one site. The sequence of a second Haemophilus plasmid, pJB1, was identical to that of pHD131 in the same region, except at two nucleotides. All three plasmids were identical in nucleotide sequence in other TnA regions, as well as in regions flanking the TnA sequence, except that the Neisseria plasmid lacked a TnA segment of 3,298 bp [comprising the IR(L) and proximal sequences] together with approximately 273 bp of the non-TnA region adjacent to IR(L). The sequence of a second N. gonorrhoeae plasmid, pFA7, was identical to pFA3, except that the terminal, 3,299 TnA nucleotides were missing.
TI  - The time course of hydrolysis of a beta-lactam antibiotic by intact gram-negative bacteria possessing a periplasmic beta-lactamase.
AB  - An equation is derived from first principles for describing the change in concentration with time of a beta-lactam antibiotic in the presence of intact Gram-negative bacteria possessing a beta-lactamase located in the periplasmic space. The equation predicts a first-order decline in beta-lactam concentration of the form [S] = [Si]e lambda t, where [S] is the exogenous concentration of beta-lactam, [Si] is the value of [S] at time zero, t is the time from mixing of cells and antibiotic and lambda (less than 0) is the decay constant. The value of lambda is exactly described by the theory in terms of experimentally measurable quantities. Quantitative data concerning cephaloridine hydrolysis by intact cells of Haemophilus influenzae agreed well with the theory, as did data concerning the uptake of 2-nitrophenyl galactoside by intact cells of Escherichia coli. Cephalosporin C hydrolysis by intact cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa did not progress as predicted by the theory. The theory is applicable to any substrate which is acted on by an enzyme that is located solely in the periplasmic space and that obeys the Michaelis-Menten equation of enzyme kinetics.
TI  - Isolation of Haemophilus influenzae genes that suppress Escherichia coli polA mutations.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae was found to produce a DNA polymerase that was similar to  polymerase I of Escherichia coli. E. coli polA mutants were used as backgrounds for the selection of H. influenzae polA suppressor genes. Six different H. influenzae fragments were isolated that could suppress E. coli polA mutations. None of the suppressors appeared to encode the H. influenzae equivalent of the E. coli polA gene. One type of clone, represented by pGW41, caused a polymerase I activity to appear in a suppressed polA1 mutant. Plasmids from the pGW41 class contained two genes (pol-2 and pol-3) that were both required for polA suppression. Mutated nonsuppressing derivatives of the pGW41 class were used to create H. influenzae mutants that were deficient in polymerase I.
TI  - Characterization of fimbrial subunits from Bordetella species.
AB  - Using antisera raised against serotype 2 and 3 fimbrial subunits from Bordetella  pertussis, serologically related polypeptides were detected in Bordetella bronchiseptica, Bordetella parapertussis and Bordetella avium strains. The two B. pertussis fimbrial subunits, and three of the serologically related B. bronchiseptica polypeptides, were shown to be very similar in amino acid composition and N-terminal amino acid sequence. Homology was observed between the N-termini of these polypeptides, and fimbrial subunits from Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae and Proteus mirabilis. A synthetic oligonucleotide probe, derived from the N-terminal sequence of the B. pertussis serotype 2 fimbrial subunit, was used to identify fimbrial genes in genomic Southern blots. The results suggested the presence of multiple fimbrial subunit genes in B. pertussis, B. bronchiseptica and B. parapertussis. The DNA probe was used to clone one of the three tentative fimbrial subunit genes detected in B. pertussis.
TI  - Assembly of a chemically synthesized peptide of Escherichia coli type 1 fimbriae  into fimbria-like antigenic structures.
AB  - Escherichia coli type 1 fimbriae are composed of subunits, each of which comprises 158 amino acids. We synthesized a copy of a 13-residue peptide, located near the NH2 terminus of the fimbrial subunit, that assumed some of the properties of type 1 fimbriae. At pH 5.5 the synthetic peptide autoassembled into fibrillar structures that resembled type 1 fimbriae except that they appeared less rigid and rodlike. A quaternary structure-specific monoclonal antibody against type 1 fimbriae recognized the synthetic peptide in the assembled but not the unassembled state. Furthermore, when the synthetic peptide was injected in its fimbrial conformation into rabbits, it evoked antibodies that reacted with type 1 fimbriae isolated from E. coli.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies of cefuzonam in the field  of obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  - To study the transfer of cefuzonam (CZON, L-105) into female genital organs, concentrations of the compound in pelvic dead space exudate were measured in cases of radical hysterectomy due to cervical cancer and analyzed by the two-compartment model. When CZON 1 g was drip-infused intravenously, the concentration in the cubital vein blood was 46.95 micrograms/ml at 1 hour after the start of infusion. Concentrations in the pelvic dead space exudate reached the peak of 11.29 micrograms/ml at 2.44 hours after the start, were higher than 4 micrograms/ml after 8 hours and were higher than 1.7 micrograms/ml after 12 hours. The area under the concentration-time curve in the pelvic dead space exudate was 77.85 micrograms X hr/ml. From these results CZON was considered to be effective when administered at 1 g against infections of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and haemophilus influenzae, but increased dose levels seemed necessary against infections of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Bacteroides fragilis. In 3 cases of obstetric and gynecological infections the efficacy of CZON was good in 2 cases and unknown in the other case.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of cefadroxil, and the interpretation of disc-susceptibility testing.
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefadroxil were determined for 749 defined clinically-significant bacteria isolated in a London teaching hospital and for 63 strains from an international collection of Gram-negative bacilli. Assuming a breakpoint of 16 mg/l, for the hospital isolates 81.8% of Gram-negative bacilli and 83.4% of Gram-positive cocci were sensitive. No significant difference between in-patient, out-patient or community-acquired isolates was found. Ninety-five and a half per cent of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes (including gentamicin-resistant strains), Proteus mirabilis, and (with the exception of Streptococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) all Gram-positive cocci were sensitive. Of 41 strains of Enterobacter spp., were resistant. Most indole-positive Proteus, and all Serratia and Acinetobacter spp. were resistant, including 36 additional strains taken from an international collection. Of 30 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, only six had MICs of 16 mg/l or less. For disc susceptibility testing, the standard disc containing 30 micrograms of cefadroxil reliably gave zones of greater than 17 mm for organisms with MICs of less than 16 mg/l. A zone of less than 14 mm corresponded to MICs of greater than 64 mg/l. Despite a lack of controlled clinical trials, the results of this study (taken with favourable pharmacokinetics) suggest that cefadroxil has potential as an oral cephalosporin in hospital practice in the U.K.
TI  - An analysis of community and hospital-acquired bacteraemia in a large teaching hospital in the United Kingdom.
AB  - A total of 875 episodes of bacteraemia and fungaemia were analysed in patients admitted to University Hospital, Nottingham, and three smaller hospitals over a four-year period. In 814 episodes (93 per cent) a single organism was isolated, most commonly Escherichia coli (27.4 per cent), other enterobacteria (14.4 per cent), Staphylococcus aureus (11.2 per cent), Streptococcus pneumoniae (9.0 per cent), or Haemophilus influenzae (6.4 per cent). In 61 cases (7.0 per cent) bacteraemia was due to two or more species. In almost 60 per cent of cases, bacteraemia was considered to be community-acquired. The most common sources were the urinary (26.9 per cent), respiratory (14.6 per cent), gastrointestinal (11.6 per cent) and biliary (9.5 per cent) tracts, but in almost 10 per cent of cases the focus of infection was unknown. Polymicrobial bacteraemia was common when the biliary tract was the focus of infection. Shock was recorded in 19.5 per cent of cases, and was commoner in polymicrobial (42.9 per cent) than in monomicrobial (17.4 per cent) episodes. In monomicrobial episodes haemolytic streptococci were associated with the highest incidence of shock (30.0 per cent). Mortality directly related to bacteraemia (19.5 per cent) was higher with Gram-positive (23.5 per cent) than with Gram-negative (15.8 per cent) organisms; in polymicrobial (31.1 per cent) than in monomicrobial episodes (18.7 per cent); and in those who had multiple episodes (34.7 per cent) than in those who had a single episode of bacteraemia (20.3 per cent). Other factors influencing mortality included shock, failure to mount an adequate febrile response, leucopenia or granulocytopenia, and underlying disease. Mortality was markedly reduced by appropriate treatment; a single antimicrobial agent was as effective as combination therapy in bacteraemia caused by Gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Mobilization of Haemophilus influenzae chromosomal markers by an Escherichia coli F' factor.
AB  - Filter matings between E. coli K-12 strains carrying an F'::Tn5,Tn9 factor with H. influenzae Rd strains gave rise to kanamycin-chloramphenicol-resistant H. influenzae strains at a frequency of approximately 10(-6). Transfer of the F' factor to H. influenzae was verified by expression of unselected markers in H. influenzae (lac+ or cotransfer of the nonselected antibiotic resistance), physical presence of a high-molecular-weight plasmid in recipient H. influenzae cells, and detection by Southern hybridization analysis of DNA sequences specific for the F' factor replication and partition functions in recipient H. influenzae cells. H. influenzae (F' Tn5,Tn9) strains were capable of transferring kanamycin and chloramphenicol resistances to other H. influenzae strains and were capable of mobilizing H. influenzae chromosomal markers at a low frequency. Insertion of a Tn5 element in the H. influenzae genome near the novobiocin resistance gene increased the frequency of transfer of novobiocin resistance about 30-fold. Transfer of other chromosomal markers also increased, although to a lesser extent, and ordered transfer of chromosomal markers could be demonstrated. Gene transfer was insensitive to DNase I, and transfer of chromosomal (but not F' factor) markers was dependent on the H. influenzae rec-1 and rec-2 gene functions.
TI  - NTP Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of Ampicillin Trihydrate (CAS No. 7177-48-2) in F344/N Rats and B6C3F1 Mice (Gavage Studies).
AB  - Ampicillin trihydrate is a broad-spectrum semi-synthetic penicillin that is effective in the treatment of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections produced by Streptococcus, Bacillus anthracis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Escherichia coli. This antibiotic is used in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections, genital and urinary tract infections, and otitis media in children. Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of ampicillin trihydrate (97%-99% pure) were conducted by administering the chemical in corn oil by gavage to groups of 50 F344/N rats and 50 B6C3F1 mice of each sex, 5 days per week for 103 weeks. Male and female rats received doses of 0, 750, or 1,500 mg/kg, and male and female mice received doses of 0, 1,500, or 3,000 mg/kg. Doses selected for the 2-year studies were based on the lack of body weight effects and histopathologic effects at 2,400 mg/kg in the 14-day studies and 3,000 mg/kg in the 13-week studies. Clinical signs in the 13-week studies included diarrhea at 3,000 mg/kg in male and female rats and male mice. Corn oil suspensions containing more than 300 mg ampicillin trihydrate/ml were too viscous to be administered by gavage; therefore, a high dose of 1,500 mg/kg was selected for rats and a high dose of 3,000 mg/kg was selected for mice. During the 2-year studies, mean body weights of male and female rats were similar to or slightly increased over those of the corresponding vehicle control groups. Mean body weights of low dose and high dose male mice were similar to those of the corresponding vehicle group during year 1 of the study but were slightly below those of the vehicle control group during the last half of the study. Mean body weights of low dose and high dose female mice were greater than those of the vehicle controls throughout most of the study. No significant differences in survival were observed in groups of rats or mice of either sex. Clinical signs observed in dosed rats included diarrhea, excessive urination, and chromodacryorrhea and in dosed mice included increased salivation and decreased activity. In male rats, administration of ampicillin trihydrate was associated with an increased incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia (vehicle control, 5/50; low dose, 14/50; high dose, 13/50). Malignant lymphomas were observed in one additional vehicle control male rat and two low dose male rats. Lymphocytic leukemia was seen in one high dose rat. High dose male rats showed increased incidences of pheochromocytomas of the adrenal gland medulla (13/50; 12/50; 23/49). Malignant pheochromocytomas were observed in 1/50 vehicle control, 5/50 low dose, and 1/49 high dose male rats. The incidence of adrenal gland medullary hyperplasia was not increased in male rats (14/50; 10/50; 8/49). There were increased incidences of C-cellhyperplasia of the thyroid gland in low dose male and high dose female rats. High dose male rats showed increased incidences of hyperkeratosis and acanthosis of the forestomach. In male and female mice, ampicillin trihydrate administration was associated with increased incidences of forestomach lesions, including ulcers, inflammation, hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and evidence of fungal infection. Ampicillin trihydrate was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, or TA1537 in the presence or absence of Aroclor 1254-induced male Syrian hamster or male Sprague-Dawley rat liver S9 when tested according to preincubation protocol. Ampicillin trihydrate was not mutagenic in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells with or without metabolic activation. Ampicillin trihydrate did not cause chromosomal aberrations or sister-chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells with or without metabolic activation. An audit was conducted for these 2-year studies. Animal/carcass identification discrepancies were observed in rats and mice. The most common findings were the failure to clip some toes in rats and opened ear holes in mice. A review of the inlife data (including body weights, clinical observations, and dosing records) indicrecords) indicated that animals had not been interchanged among groups. The data are considered adequate to support the conclusions. Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenicity of ampicillin trihydrate for male F344/N rats as shown by increased incidences of pheochromocytomas of the adrenal medulla and by marginally increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia. There was no evidence of carcinogenicity for female F344/N rats receiving 750 or 1,500 mg/kg or for male and female B6C3F1 mice receiving 1,500 or 3,000 mg/kg per day. Nonneoplastic lesions of the forestomach were seen in male rats and male and female mice.

TI  - [Recent trend of childhood bacterial meningitis in Japan (1979-1984). Part 4. A classification of prognosis and antibiotic treatment based on causative agents].
AB  - Nine hundred seventy cases of childhood bacterial meningitis treated at 107 institutions in Japan from 1979 through 1984 were studied using questionnaire. The number of cases that underwent antimicrobial monotherapy remained nearly constant during the study period, but cases of therapies with beta-lactam combined with aminoglycosides (AGs) decreased in number and a gradual increase in the use of beta-lactam combined with non-AGs antibiotics including beta-lactam (Non AGs) was observed. A trend showing decrease in case fatality rate (CFR) was observed except that CFR for Gram-positive bacterial infections treated with beta-lactam + AGs remained at a same level. Cases treated with antibiotics were classified into 3 groups according to major etiological pathogens. Cases with Staphylococcus aureus gave a poor prognosis, among 27 total cases, CFR was 28.6% (2/7) with monotherapy, 50.0% (6/12) with beta-lactam + AGs and 37.5% (3/8) with beta-lactam + Non AGs (P less than 0.1). Among 100 cases of group B Streptococcus (GBS), CFR was 20.0% as a whole, 17.3% (9/52) for monotherapy and 34.5% (10/29) for beta-lactam + AGs (P less than 0.1). Among 198 cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae, CFR was 12.1% as a whole, and was 12.3% (18/146) with monotherapy. CFR for the cases treated with beta-lactam + AGs was 20.8% (5/24) and with beta-lactam + Non AGs was 3.6% (1/28) (P less than 0.1). CFR for 292 cases of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis was fairly low, and was 6.1% (9/148) with monotherapy, 7.4% (5/68) with beta-lactam + AGs and 3.9% (3/76) with beta-lactam + Non AGs, thus very slight differences were observed among the 3 groups of treatment. Among 111 cases of Escherichia coli, monotherapy and beta-lactam + Non AGs gave 6.5% (2/31) CFR, and 5.6% (1/18) CFR, respectively, whereas beta-lactam + AGs showed CFR of 19.4% (12/62), demonstrating a significant difference tendency (P less than 0.1). Similar tendencies were observed in the cases of Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis. Contrary to the high CFR observed with the beta-lactam + AGs treatment, significantly low CFR was frequently obtained in cases treated with a combination of penicillins with cephalosporins including latamoxef or beta-lactam with chloramphenicol. Infections with GBS, E. coli, and P. mirabilis occurred largely in the age between 0 to 6 months and CFR was especially high in the very young.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Differences in antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical isolates in Saudi Arabia and the United States.
AB  - In vitro antimicrobial susceptibilities of 3,530 clinical isolates at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center (KFSH), in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, were compared with those of 11,041 bacterial isolates at two hospitals of comparable size in the United States. The gram-negative bacteria, especially Escherichia coli, Proteus-Morganella group, Enterobacter sp, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were generally more resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, gentamicin, piperacillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole at KFSH than in the United States. A larger number of isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were more resistant to cephalosporin, chloramphenical, gentamicin, piperacillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole at one of the tertiary care hospitals in the United States. Hemophilus influenzae and gram-positive cocci exhibited similar susceptibilities toward commonly used antibiotics at all three institutions.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new monobactam, B0-1165.
AB  - B0-1165 is a 1-carboxy-1-cyclopropoxyamino,4-fluoromethyl monobactam. It inhibited the majority of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Yersinia enterocolitica, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Salmonella and Shigella species at less than or equal to 0.125 microgram/ml. Overall, its in vitro activity was similar to that of aztreonam, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime, with minor differences in the MICs for individual isolates. Enterobacter species and Citrobacter freundii which were derepressed for beta-lactamase production and had higher MICs of aztreonam and ceftazidime had MICs that ranged from 4 to 32 micrograms/ml. B0-1165 had activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa similar to that of aztreonam but lower than that of ceftazidime and carumonam. Pseudomonas maltophilia and other Pseudomonas species were resistant or had MICs of 32 micrograms/ml, as did Acinetobacter species. B0-1165 did not inhibit streptococcal, staphylococcal, or anaerobic species, such as Clostridium and Bacteroides species. B0-1165 was not hydrolyzed to any appreciable extent by common plasmid- and chromosomally Richmond-Sykes type 1a-, 1c-, and 1d-mediated beta-lactamases. It inhibited the Enterobacter cloacae P99 and inducible Pseudomonas aeruginosa beta-lactamases. B0-1165 was a poor inducer of beta-lactamase, but exposing E. cloacae and C. freundii to B0-1165 selected for resistant isolates. Overall, B0-1165 had in vitro properties similar to those of other monobactams currently available or under investigation.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefuzonam in pediatrics and a study on the penetration into cerebrospinal fluid].
AB  - Studies were carried out on the penetration of cefuzonam (L-105, CZON), a new synthetic cephalosporin antibiotic, into cerebrospinal fluid, and on the clinical efficacy against bacterial infections. The results are summarized as follows: Concentrations of CZON in cerebrospinal fluid at 1 hour after intravenous administration of 100 mg/kg in cases of furunculosis of the external canal, encephalitis and mumps meningitis were 0.56 micrograms/ml, 1.44 micrograms/ml and 0.33 micrograms/ml, respectively. Concentrations of CZON in cerebrospinal fluid at 1 hour after intravenous administration of 100 mg/kg in 3 cases of purulent meningitis were 2.80-6.40 micrograms/ml at the acute stage and 0.56-1.45 micrograms/ml even at the recovering stage. Sensitivities of clinically isolated strains to CZON were determined and expressed as MIC. MICs of CZON on Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae were similar to MIC's of cefmenoxime (CMX), and lower than those of cefoperazone (CPZ), cefmetazole (CMZ), cefatiam (CTM) and Cefazolin (CEZ). The MIC of CZON on Staphylococcus aureus was similar to those of CEZ, CMZ and CTM, and lower than those of CMX and CPZ. Clinical responses of CZON were good in 2 cases of purulent meningitis, good in 2 cases of pyothorax, excellent in 1 case of septicemia, excellent in 3 cases of urinary tract infections, excellent in 7 cases and good in 3 cases out of 10 cases of pneumonia. Clinical responses of other diseases were excellent in 4 cases of bronchitis, good in 1 case of furunculosis of the external canal, excellent in 1 case of tonsillitis. No side effects nor abnormal laboratory findings were observed except 2 cases of mild diarrhea out of 24 cases.
TI  - [Evaluation of cefuzonam in the pediatric field].
AB  - Cefuzonam (L-105, CZON) was studied in pediatric infections. A summary of the results it as follows: For recently isolated Staphylococcus aureus strains, Peak MICs of CZON were distributed between 0.39 and 0.78 micrograms/ml showing a greater susceptibility of S. aureus to CZON than to cefoperazone (CPZ), latamoxef (LMOX), and cefmenoxime (CMX). Peak MICs of CZON for Escherichia coli were 0.10-0.20 micrograms/ml, similar to those of CPZ, LMOX, and CMX. Ampicillin (ABPC)-resistant strains were also susceptible to CZON. MICs for Salmonella were similar to those for E. coli. Peak MICs of CZON for Vibrio parahaemolyticus were 0.20-0.39 micrograms/ml. The susceptibility of the bacteria to CZON was far greater than to ABPC, and was similar to CPZ, LMOX, and CMX. With 20 mg/kg drip infusion, serum concentrations reached their peaks at the end of administration with values of 20.6-68.7 micrograms/ml, which decreased to 0.43-1.70 micrograms/ml after 2 hours. Half-lives of CZON in serum were 0.68-1.2 hours. With 50 mg/kg drip infusion, serum concentrations reached their peaks at the end of administration with levels of 69.0-82.0 micrograms/ml, and at after 2 hours 1.85-3.45 micrograms/ml. Thus, an apparent dose response was observed. Half-lives of CZON in serum were 0.63-0.99 hours. Urinary recovery rates in 6 hours were 39.9-80.5%. A total of 44 cases of 10 different types of acute pediatric infections was treated by CZON intravenous drip infusion as the main therapeutic procedure. The efficacy rate was 93.2%, and the compound was effective on purulent infections, acute urinary tract infection, etc. with pathogens such as ABPC-resistant S. aureus, E. coli, and Enterococcus faecalis. Dosage levels per day were 50 to 80 mg/kg in most cases. In infections with S. aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (3 strains), E. faecalis (1 strain), Haemophilus parahaemolyticus (1 strain), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (2 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (11 strains), Bordetella pertussis (1 strain), E. coli (3 strains), a total of 30 strains, bacterial elimination was noted with an exception of 1 strain of S. aureus. The compound was used for 4 to 15 days, but side effects observed clinically were only 1 case of diarrhea and 1 case of thrombocytosis.
TI  - Comparative antibacterial activity of a new oral cephalosporin, BMY-28100.
AB  - BMY-28100 is a new oral cephalosporin which had in vitro activity superior to that of cephalexin and cefaclor against staphylococci, beta-hemolytic streptococcal species, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. It inhibited beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 50% of Streptococcus faecalis isolates, Listeria monocytogenes, and 50 to 75% of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species at less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, but high producers of beta-lactamase were resistant. Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Morganella, Providencia, and Pseudomonas species and Bacteroides fragilis were resistant. BMY-28100 was more stable than cefaclor against hydrolysis by beta-lactamases.
TI  - Etiology and diagnosis of neonatal conjunctivitis.
AB  - Chlamydia trachomatis was isolated from the most inflamed eye of 13 of 107 (12%)  infants with neonatal purulent conjunctivitis and from none of 100 healthy infants (p less than 0.01). Staphylococcus aureus was recovered from 49 (46%) inflamed eyes and from 8 (8%) healthy eyes (p less than 0.01). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated from very few infants with conjunctivitis but not from controls. No organisms could be recovered from 23 (22%) infants with conjunctivitis and from 60 (60%) healthy infants (p less than 0.01). The incidence of neonatal purulent conjunctivitis was 107 (2%), of 5,924 births. Eyes infected with C. trachomatis were significantly more inflamed than eyes from which S. aureus or no organisms could be isolated. Furthermore, conjunctival "pseudomembranes" were associated with C. trachomatis. The age at onset of the chlamydial conjunctivitis was higher compared to the age at onset of conjunctivitis in which S. aureus or no organisms were isolated.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefuzonam in pediatrics].
AB  - Cefuzonam (L-105, CZON), a new injectable cephalosporin, was used in 12 pediatric patients with infections. The following is a summary of the results: The 12 cases included 3 cases of tonsillitis (pathogen: Haemophilus parainfluenzae in 1 case, Haemophilus influenzae in 2 cases), 4 cases of pneumonia (Staphylococcus aureus in 1 case, pathogen unknown in 3 cases), 2 cases of nephropyelitis (Escherichia coli in 2 cases), 1 case of purulent lymphadenitis (pathogen unknown), 1 case of purulent thyroiditis (mixed infection of Streptococcus milleri, Haemophilus aphrophilus and anaerobes), and 1 case of vulvar abscess (E. coli). Dose levels of CZON were 42.9 approximately 93.3 mg/kg/day divided into 3 or 4 times and the drug was intravenously injected for 6 to 12 days. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 4 cases, good in 5 cases, and poor in 3 cases, with the efficacy rate of 75.0%. The 3 cases with poor efficacy consisted of 1 case each of pneumonia complicated with chronic granulomatosis, purulent thyroiditis associated with piriform recess fistula, and purulent lymphadenitis of armpit developed after surgical operation of congenital heart disease. In the first 2 cases satisfactory efficacy was not obtained by chemotherapy alone, and complete cure was seen after surgical operation. Side effects were not observed clinically. One case each of slight prolongation of prothrombin time and transient elevations of GOT and GPT values were noted but no severe abnormalities were found in laboratory tests.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam (L-105, CZON), a newly semisynthesized cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics and the following results were obtained. Antibacterial activities of CZON against clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and H. influenzae were compared with those of cefmenoxime (CMX), latamoxef (LMOX), cefoperazone (CPZ), cefmetazole (CMZ), cefotiam (CTM) and cefazolin (CEZ). CZON was nearly as active as CEZ against S. aureus and S. epidermidis and superior to other antibiotics against other Gram-positive cocci. Against Gram-negative rods, CZON was as active as CMX and superior to other 5 antibiotics compared. Serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of CZON at doses of 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 1, 5 and 4 cases, respectively, were determined. Mean serum concentrations of CZON at these dose levels were 11.0, 43.8 and 111.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes, 2.4, 10.3 and 30.3 micrograms/ml at 1 hour and 0.17, 0.72 and 1.28 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, with serum half-lives of 1.79, 0.88 and 1.19 hours, respectively. Mean cumulative urinary excretion rates within 6 hours after administration were 47.9, 56.3 and 40.3%, respectively. Thirty-four pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (tonsillitis 2, acute bronchitis 1, pneumonia 14, pyothorax 1, sepsis 1, suppurative lymphadenitis 1, UTI 13 and enteritis 1) were treated with CZON at a daily dose of 40-94 mg/kg t.i.d. or q.i.d.. The overall clinical efficacy rate was 94.1%. No adverse reactions were observed except 2 cases with mild diarrhea. Abnormal laboratory findings were also mild; slight elevation of GOT and GPT in 2, eosinophilia in 1 and thrombocytosis in 1. These results clearly indicate the usefulness of CZON in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefuzonam in children].
AB  - Cefuzonam (L-105, CZON), a new parenteral cephalosporin, was evaluated for its efficacy and safety in 22 children with bacterial infections (Table 1). The results obtained are summarized below. MICs of CZON to 26 strains of isolated organisms are shown in Table 2. MICs to all 14 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 6 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae were less than 0.05 microgram/ml. The MIC to 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus was 0.39 microgram/ml and that to another was 0.78 microgram/ml. Two strains of Escherichia coli showed MICs of less than 0.05 and 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. The MIC to 1 strain of Enterococcus faecalis was 6.25 micrograms/ml. The CZON was administered in 3 or 4 divided doses at a daily dosage ranging from 58.5 to 85.7 mg/kg by 30-minute drip infusion or intravenous injection to 22 patients (9 cases of pneumonia, 9 cases of tonsillitis, 2 cases of bronchitis, 1 case each of suppurative parotitis and acute pyelonephritis) and the following clinical results were obtained; excellent: 12 cases; good: 7 cases; fair: 3 cases. The overall efficacy rate was 86% (Table 4). Diarrhea was observed in four patients, and was resolved with or without discontinuation of the medication within a week. Anemia was noted in 2 cases. Leucopenia and neutropenia was observed in 1 case. There were a moderate rises in S-GOT and S-GPT activities in 1 patient (Table 4), and they necessitated the cessation of the CZON therapy. The S-GOT and S-GPT activities became normal after the drug treatment was stopped.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Cloning and expression of genes responsible for altered penicillin-binding proteins 3a and 3b in Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - A Haemophilus influenzae strain (T-1,3) possessing clinical beta-lactam resistance due to altered penicillin-binding protein 3 was used to construct a recombinant cosmid gene bank in Escherichia coli. Three of the recombinant cosmids were capable of transforming a susceptible H. influenzae strain (Rdnov) simultaneously to moxalactam resistance and altered the binding of penicillin-binding proteins 3a and 3b to [35S]penicillin G. Restriction endonuclease mapping of one of the recombinant cosmids, pLB100, was performed to facilitate subsequent subcloning of the gene(s) responsible for the altered penicillin-binding protein 3 (a and b) binding phenotype. Subcloning of individual fragments derived from pLB100 indicated that two adjacent fragments of DNA were both capable of transforming a susceptible Haemophilus strain to moxalactam resistance and altered penicillin-binding protein 3 binding. Expression of plasmid-coded proteins in minicells indicated that one fragment coded for a major 55,000-molecular-weight polypeptide and that the second contained a C-terminal coding region that expressed a 28,000-molecular-weight polypeptide when fused to the N-terminal region of the tetracycline resistance gene. Initial attempts at labeling the plasmid-coded proteins expressed in minicells with [35S]penicillin G were unsuccessful.
TI  - In vitro activity of CGP 31608, a new penem.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CGP 31608, a semisynthetic penem derivative, was compared with that of Sch 34343, imipenem, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, and ceftazidime and other beta-lactams, when appropriate, against 628 recent isolates and other beta-lactam-resistant strains. The MICs of CGP 31608 against 90% of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria spp., Bacteroides spp., Clostridium spp., staphylococci, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were between 0.25 and 8 micrograms/ml. The susceptibility of beta-lactamase-producing strains and known porin mutants of the Enterobacteriaceae suggests that CGP 31608 is resistant to many important beta-lactamases (including the mutationally derepressed chromosomal enzymes) and is not excluded from the bacterial cell in strains expressing these known porin mutations. Generally, CGP 31608 was less active than imipenem, Sch 34343, and the cephalosporins, except against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The activity of CGP 31608 against Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains) was greater than that of the cephalosporins. The major target site in Escherichia coli K-12 for CGP 31608 was penicillin-binding protein 2. The serum protein binding of 5 micrograms of CGP 31608 per ml was 14%, and serum had little effect on activity.
TI  - Vaccines against encapsulated bacteria: a global agenda.
AB  - The World Health Organization (WHO) asked the authors to create a comprehensive program for the development of vaccines against encapsulated bacteria as a guide for the WHO Programme on Vaccine Development. The goal is a new generation of safe, inexpensive, and easily administered vaccines that are immunogenic in infancy and provide prolonged immunity in the vaccinate, secondary immunization to community members not reached in the initial application, and/or herd immunity. The approach is to capitalize on advances in molecular biology, biochemistry, and immunology, and the agenda developed addresses the five genera that cause most morbidity in less-developed areas of the world: Neisseria, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Haemophilus, and Pseudomonas. Three strategic areas for study are emphasized: existing polysaccharide vaccines, natural immunity and pathogenesis, and evaluation of new or speculative alternative approaches. It is hoped that this agenda will stimulate the widest possible participation in this global initiative.
TI  - Nucleotide sequences and properties of the sites involved in lysogenic insertion  of the bacteriophage HP1c1 genome into the Haemophilus influenzae chromosome.
AB  - Bacteriophage HP1c1 lysogenizes its host Haemophilus influenzae Rd by inserting its genome into the bacterial chromosome. The DNA segments corresponding to the integration regions on the phage and host chromosomes and the two junctions formed between phage and host sequences on lysogenic insertion were isolated and propagated in Escherichia coli HB101 as hybrid plasmids by using pBR322 as the vector. The nucleotide sequences in the vicinity of the point of recombinational insertion were determined. Phage and host DNA shared an extensive, nearly identical, segment that was 183 base pairs long. This segment consisted of 93 identical residues and a 27-residue portion containing 6 mismatches, followed by 63 identical residues. Recombinational insertion occurred within the 63-residue identical segment and involved neither duplication nor deletion of any residues. Short inverted repeats consisting of clustered A-T base pairs were present within the two 27-residue segments. Two additional sites on the host chromosome showed significant hybridization to the phage-host homology region.
TI  - Efficacy and tolerance of oral ofloxacin in treating various infections.
AB  - 66 patients were given daily doses of ofloxacin between 400 and 800 mg for 10 days to 6 months. They were suffering from exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (15), soft tissue phlegmon (11), complicated urinary tract infections (7), bronchopneumonia (7), chronic osteomyelitis in exacerbation (8), chronic prostatitis in exacerbation (5), lower urinary tract infections (3), chronic otitis media (3), acute otitis (3), acute bronchitis (1), lung abscess (2) or liver abscess (1). Pathogens included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (24), Haemophilus influenzae (16), Proteus mirabilis (6), Escherichia coli (6), Enterobacter cloacae (6), Providencia stuartii (2), Serratia marcescens (2), Citrobacter diversus (1), Salmonella enteritidis (1), Acinetobacter anitratus (1), Staphylococcus aureus (1) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1). In 35 patients (53%), several aggravating factors coexisted. MICs of ofloxacin ranged from less than or equal to 0.06 to 2 mg/L. Clinically, 65% of the patients were considered as cured, 17% improved and 18% failed to respond. Bacteriologically, pathogens were eradicated in 62%, persisted in 16% and relapsed in 22%. Adverse reactions included gastrointestinal disturbances (4), rash plus facial oedema (1), abnormal liver function (2) and leucopenia (1).
TI  - Microbiological perspectives of co-trimoxazole.
AB  - Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in vitro activity was compared with ampicillin, tetracycline, sulfonamide and trimethoprim against isolates of 24 gram-negative and 11 gram-positive species. The incidence of more than 10% of strains with minimal inhibitory concentrations above 32 mg/l was restricted to Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia rettgeri, Morganella morganii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Occasionally, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae strains with MICs above 32 mg/l were identified. Co-trimoxazole in vitro activity was superior to the comparative drugs for the majority of species. Co-trimoxazole remains an active combination against major pathogens of infections of the upper and lower respiratory, urinary tract and enteric infections with a still low incidence of resistant organisms.
TI  - Cephalosporins in the treatment of meningitis.
AB  - The synthesis of new cephalosporin antibiotics has provided agents which can effectively be used to treat most of the different forms of meningitis. None of the first generation cephalosporins can be considered acceptable as agents to treat meningitis. Cefuroxime can be used to treat meningitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis in children. Agents such as cefotaxime and ceftriaxone are appropriate for neonatal meningitis due to Escherichia coli and group B streptococci, but not Listeria monocytogenes. Cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftizoxime and ceftazidime have all proved effective as therapy of meningitis in children and adults when the pathogens are pneumococci, H. influenzae or N. meningitidis, but they have not been shown to yield an improved mortality or lower morbidity in spite of much greater cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) bactericidal titres. Cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime have been effective as therapy of meningitis due to E. coli, K. pneumoniae and Proteus species, but failures have occurred with all of the cephalosporins when used to treat meningitis due to Enterobacter spp. and Serratia marcescens. Only ceftazidime yields adequate CSF concentrations to treat meningitis due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Overall, the cephalosporins can now be considered a major component of the therapy of acute bacterial meningitis irrespective of the age group to be treated.
TI  - Septicemia in a university pediatric hospital: a five-year analysis of the bacterial and fungal isolates and outcome of the infections.
AB  - A 5-year analysis comprising all positive blood culture isolates from a 222-bed university pediatric hospital in Helsinki revealed 369 bacteremic but only 8 fungemic cases. Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus, 19% of the total material each, were the most common pathogens isolated, followed by S. epidermidis (11%), Escherichia coli (8%), pneumococci (8%), and group B beta-hemolytic streptococci (6%). Remarkable differences in distribution of the pathogens were observed in different hospital units. However, 5 most common microorganisms covered 62-86% of the spectrum in each unit. Two bacteria, H. influenzae in the unit for infectious diseases and S. aureus in the hematology-oncology unit were significantly (p less than 0.001 or less than 0.01, respectively) more common than any other organism in those units. The average case fatality rate was 14% with a range from 1.5% to 40%, depending upon the causative agent isolated. Also, the mortality was much higher in neonates than in other age groups. We conclude that by monitoring the blood isolates separately in each unit one can find remarkable differences in the same hospital. On the other hand, characteristics of an individual hospital may vary significantly from those described in textbooks. These characteristics should be recognized and taken into account in the antimicrobial policy.
TI  - Efficacy of oral immunization against non-typable Haemophilus influenzae in man.
AB  - An oral polybacterial vaccine containing 1.5 X 10(9) killed Haemophilus influenzae per tablet stimulated salivary IgA anti H. influenzae antibody compared to placebo control groups according to statistical analysis using parameter estimates for the logistic model of best fit. Significant antibody secretion could only be demonstrated when three-monthly courses were taken, and when the H. influenzae were combined in a polybacterial mix. This latter form of H. influenzae is functionally defined as adjuvenated. Increasing the immunising dose 60 fold in the absence of the non H. influenzae bacterial species did not stimulate a detectable increase in salivary antibody.
TI  - Protein sources of heme for Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Although Haemophilus influenzae requires heme for growth, the source of heme during invasive infections is not known. We compared heme, lactoperoxidase, catalase, cytochrome c, myoglobin, and hemoglobin as sources of heme for growth in defined media. The minimum concentration of heme permitting unrestricted growth of strain E1a, an H. influenzae type b isolate from cerebrospinal fluid, was 0.02 micrograms/ml. Using molar equivalents of heme as lactoperoxidase, catalase, cytochrome c, myoglobin, and hemoglobin, we determined that myoglobin and hemoglobin permitted unrestricted growth at this concentration. To determine the ability of host defenses to sequester heme from H. influenzae, we used affinity chromatography to purify human haptoglobin and hemopexin, serum proteins which bind hemoglobin and heme. Plate assays revealed that 12 strains of H. influenzae acquired heme from hemoglobin, hemoglobin-haptoglobin, heme-hemopexin, and heme-albumin. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of outer membrane proteins of strain E1a grown in heme-replete and heme-restricted conditions revealed a heme-repressible outer membrane protein with an apparent molecular mass of 38 kilodaltons. These results demonstrated that, unlike Escherichia coli, H. influenzae may acquire heme from hemoglobin-haptoglobin. H. influenzae also may acquire heme from hemopexin and albumin, which have not been previously investigated. The role of outer membrane proteins in the acquisition of heme is not yet clear.
TI  - Phototoxic effects of fluoranthene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, on bacterial species.
AB  - Fluoranthene, a non-carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, inactivates Escherichia coli cells in the presence of near-ultraviolet light (NUV; 300-400 nm). E coli cells carrying defects in the uvrA6 or katF genes are sensitized to inactivation by the simultaneous treatment with fluoranthene and NUV, suggesting that DNA is a target and that hydrogen peroxide is generated. Haemophilus influenzae transforming DNA can be inactivated by the simultaneous treatment with fluoranthene and NUV confirming DNA as a target. Using the photooxidation of imidazole and histidine as probes, fluoranthene was found to generate singlet oxygen in organic and aqueous media. In water, it participated in electron transfer reactions, reducing nitro blue tetrazolium as well as ferricytochrome C. This reduction took place both in the presence of air, where superoxide anion was formed, and under argon. Simultaneous treatment with fluoranthene and NUV was incapable of inducing histidine-independent mutations. Simultaneous treatment with fluoranthene and NUV was incapable of inducing the uvrA gene product as evidenced by the absence of the induction of beta-galactosidase in an E coli operon fusion strain [uvrA215::Mud(Ap,lac)].
TI  - Osteoarticular infections in children with sickle cell disease.
AB  - Thirteen children with sickle cell disease were identified as having 14 episodes  of osteoarticular infection in a review of 27 years' experience. There were eight episodes of osteomyelitis or osteoarthritis and six of suppurative arthritis alone. The etiologic agents in osteomyelitis or osteoarthritis were Salmonella sp in four cases, Escherichia coli in one, Enterobacter aerogenes in one, Staphylococcus aureus in one, and Haemophilus influenzae type b in one. Five of the cases with infection limited to the joint were caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae; the sixth was caused by H influenzae type b. Fever (greater than or equal to 38.3 degrees C) was present in all children and the temperature was in excess of 39 degrees C in 62%. The mean duration of pain before admission was 4.5 days. The initial total white blood cell count ranged from 5,200 to 29,700/microL (mean 19,436/microL) and the total band neutrophil count ranged from 0 to 5,103/microL (mean 1,660/microL). The ESR was greater than 20 mm/h in eight of the ten patients who were tested. Management consisted of antibiotic therapy in all. Needle aspiration was performed in two patients with osteomyelitis and in three with suppurative arthritis. Incision and drainage was performed in two cases of osteomyelitis and in four with suppurative arthritis. The outcome was satisfactory in all except one patient who had several complications as a consequence of femoral neck osteomyelitis. Recurrence was reported in only one patient.
TI  - The comparison of myocardial dysfunction in three forms of experimental septic shock.
AB  - A rabbit model of septic shock was used to determine if myocardial dysfunction is a common component of shock due to diverse neonatal pathogens, and prostaglandins modulate septic myocardial dysfunction. The infusion of heat-killed Escherichia coli (group I), Haemophilus influenzae (group II), or Staphylococcus epidermidis (group III) produced significant decreases in the first derivative of left ventricular pressure with respect to time (p less than 0.05). Each organism also produced significant changes in mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, and heart rate, while pulmonary artery pressure was altered in groups I and III. Saline-infused control animals (group IV) exhibited no significant changes in any hemodynamic variable. Blood gas variables were not significantly changed in any group. These cardiovascular changes appeared dependent on arachidonic acid metabolism since indomethacin pretreatment prevented the cardiovascular changes induced by bacterial infusion. These results suggest that septic myocardial dysfunction is a common component of gram-negative and gram-positive septic shock, and that myocardial dysfunction is modulated by prostaglandin products.
TI  - Evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin against nosocomial infections and multiresistant pathogens.
AB  - Thirty-five patients suffering from soft tissue infections (12), upper UTIs (6),  bronchopneumonia (6), septicaemia (2), chronic osteomyelitis (2), intra-abdominal abscess (2), liver abscess (1), lung abscess (1), acute cholangitis (1), thoracic empyema (1) and chronic prostatitis (1) were given imipenem/cilastatin for 6-21 days. In 22 patients several aggravating factors coexisted, while infection in 16 patients was polymicrobial. The following pathogens were implicated: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21), Escherichia coli (15), Enterobacter cloacae (6), Proteus spp. (3), Klebsiella pneumoniae(3), Citrobacter freundii (1), Salmonella enteritidis (1), Acinetobacter spp. (4), Haemophilus influenzae (2), Bacteroides fragilis (1) and Peptococcus saccharolyticus (1) with MICs to imipenem ranging between 0.5 and 8 mg/l. A successful clinical response was observed in 91.4% of the patients, while pathogens were eradicated in 75.9%, persisted in 24.2% and recurred, in 9.1% of patients, with development of resistance to imipenem in two Ps. aeruginosa strains. Against 150 multiresistant strains of Ps. aeruginosa, 40% of which were resistant to amikacin, 86.4% and 88.9% were found sensitive to ceftazidime and imipenem respectively. It is concluded that imipenem provides the possibility of treating successfully multiresistant and polymicrobial infections with a single antimicrobial.
TI  - Oral ciprofloxacin therapy of infection caused by multiply resistant bacteria other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Of 125 patients treated with ciprofloxacin at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, New York, 34 had infections due to bacteria other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The mean age of the patients was 50 years (19-88 years) and most had significant underlying disease. There were nine lower respiratory infections, eight urinary tract infections, eight soft tissue infections, three osteomyelitis, and three intra-abdominal infections. The pathogens were: Escherichia coli, 7 (mean MIC 0.07 mg/l); Serratia marcescens, 6 (0.2 mg/l); Enterobacter spp., 5 (0.1 mg/l); Klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 (0.1 mg/l); Proteus mirabilis, 3 (0.06 mg/l); Cutrobacter freundii, 2 (0.06 mg/l), Staphylococcus aureus, 3 (0.5 mg/l); and one each of Acinetobacter anitratus. Haemophilus, influenzae, Salmonella enteritidis, Flavobacterium meningosepticum, and Streptococcus faecalis. Of these organisms 81% were resistant to ampicillin, 70% to carbenicillin, 22% to gentamicin, 49% to cefazolin and cephalexin, and 25% to cotrimoxazole. Ten patients had concomitant Ps. aeruginosa infections. Patients were treated orally with 500 mg or 750 mg ciprofloxacin every 12 h. The overall clinical response rate was 88%, and the bacteriological response 76%, and 65% if Ps. aeruginosa is included. Resistance to ciprofloxacin developed in one Staph. aureus and one Ser. marcescens (MIC greater than 2 mg/l). Toxicity was minor. Ciprofloxacin was effective and safe therapy of infections due to Gram-negative bacteria resistant to many of the currently available oral and parenteral agents.
TI  - Aztreonam therapy for serious gram-negative infections in children.
AB  - Fifty-nine children were enrolled in an open trial of aztreonam, a monocyclic beta-lactam, therapy for serious gram-negative infections. Thirty-six infections were microbiologically evaluable and received five or more days of therapy. Patients' ages ranged from 3 days to 12 years, and diagnoses included pyelonephritis or cystitis (20), deep soft tissue or joint infection (seven), septicemia (four), pneumonia (three), peritonitis, and epiglottitis. Causative bacteria included Escherichia coli and other Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae. The standard regimen was 30 mg/kg every six or eight hours intravenously. All isolates were aztreonam-susceptible and were eradicated during therapy. Two patients had microbiologic relapses: a patient with Salmonella choleraesuis meningitis who was initially treated for only ten days and a patient with E coli pyelonephritis. Clinical cure was achieved in 31 of 36 children. Pharmacokinetic studies performed in six children demonstrated no difference in serum concentrations or pharmacokinetic variables between day 1 and day 7 of therapy. Although several patients had transient eosinophilia (eight), elevated levels of aminotransferase (seven), or thrombocytosis (ten), no clinically significant adverse effects were noted. In this initial, uncontrolled study, aztreonam was effective and safe in the treatment of a variety of serious gram-negative infections in children.
TI  - [Treatment of bronchopulmonary infections in patients during artificial respiration with imipenem/cilastatin].
AB  - In an open prospective study the efficacy and tolerance of imipenem/cilastatin was investigated in 24 critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation with nosocomial respiratory tract infection. Nine patients had previously received antibiotic therapy which had failed. Imipenem was given in a dose of 1-3g/24 h over 5-37 (mean 11) days. Seven patients were additionally treated with aminoglycosides, one patient with erythromycin. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Hemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli were the most frequently isolated pathogens from tracheobronchial secretions. 91% of the infections without and 77% with involvement of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were successfully treated. All of the gram-positive and 85% of the gram-negative pathogens (Pseudomonas not included) were eliminated in the course of therapy. By contrast, 64% of the isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa persisted; half of these became imipenem-resistant. Nine patients showed adverse reactions including one case of pseudomembranous colitis which were reversible. Imipenem/cilastatin proved highly effective and was relatively well tolerated; limitations in the efficacy were seen in cases of infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Activity of sulbactam/ampicillin in screening and discriminative animal models of infection.
AB  - The efficacy of sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of mice with fatal systemic infections produced by ampicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Proteus vulgaris strains is well established. In this paper the demonstrations of efficacy for sulbactam/ampicillin have been extended to a number of clinically relevant models, including bacteremia and meningitis produced by H. influenzae in infant rats, experimental staphylococcal endocarditis in rabbits, localized lesions in mice, urinary tract infections in rats, and prophylaxis in a surgical wound model in mice. In these models, in which ampicillin-resistant organisms were used, sulbactam/ampicillin was either more effective than or as effective as appropriate control agents. Neither sulbactam nor ampicillin used separately displayed significant activity. The results of supportive pharmacokinetic studies, in which differential bioassays were used, demonstrated that sulbactam and ampicillin generally were delivered with equal efficiency to plasma and to extravascular fluids obtained by sampling the contents of implanted cylinders.
TI  - Opsonic activity and composition of five intramuscular gammaglobulin preparations.
AB  - The opsonic activity of five immunoglobulin preparations for intramuscular and subcutaneous substitution therapy was investigated. Various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, group B streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were used. In addition, the concentration of unsplit IgG molecules, IgG fragments and IgG aggregates in these preparations was determined. With the exception of H. influenzae, all preparations opsonised the bacteria studied almost as well as inactivated serum. All preparations contained an appreciable amount of aggregates, but IgG fragments were not found.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in infants two to six weeks old.
AB  - We reviewed our experience with bacterial meningitis in older neonates (2 to 6 weeks of age) during a five-year period. Seventeen patients with bacterial meningitis were diagnosed and treated. Bacteria recovered from the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) included pneumococci (29%), E. coli and meningococci (23% each), group B streptococci (12%), Enterobacter and H. influenzae (6% each). There were no cases of Listeria monocytogenes. The mean duration of symptoms before admission was 3.1 days. The mortality rate was high (30%), and 36% of the patients had significant neurologic residua. Our study shows that this specific age group is different from newborns or older infants. Therefore, the initial selection of antibiotics for the treatment of meningitis in this age group should include antibiotics that are effective across this spectrum of potential pathogens.
TI  - Bacteremia in sickle hemoglobinopathies.
AB  - We analyzed 178 episodes of bacteremia that occurred during 13,771 patient-years  of follow-up of 3451 patients with sickle hemoglobinopathies. Age-specific incidence rates of bacteremia were calculated for patients with sickle cell anemia (SS) and sickle cell-hemoglobin C (SC) disease. The incidence rate was highest among children with SS and SC younger than age 2 years. Children with SC showed an abrupt decrease after age 2 years, whereas children with SS had a gradual decline in rate from 2 to 6 years of age. The predominant pathogen in patients younger than 6 years was Streptococcus pneumoniae (66%); gram-negative organisms were responsible for 50% of bacteremias in patients 6 years and older. Urinary tract infection was present during 73% of Escherichia coli bacteremias, and 77% of Salmonella bacteremias were associated with osteomyelitis. In contrast, no focus of infection was present in 52% of pneumococcal bacteremias. The incidence of pneumococcal bacteremia in children with SS younger than age 3 years was 6.1 events/100 patient-years; the case fatality rate for pneumococcal sepsis in this age group was 24%. No hematologic or demographic variables were associated with occurrence of pneumococcal bacteremia in young children. Retrospective analysis of pneumococcal bacteremia suggests that the prophylactic use of penicillin may decrease the incidence in children younger than 3 years of age.
TI  - [Throat culture isolation and Haemophilus influenzae cross reactions of Escherichia coli serotypes].
AB  - 73 strains of Escherichia coli were isolated from throat cultures of patients examined in the clinics of Children's Hospital of Hacettepe Medical Faculty. 11 of them were serotype 075:Kq5:H5, 8, 07:K1:05 and 1, 07:K1:H--. These 20 strains were tested for the presence of cross-reacting antigens with the Haemophilus influenzae type b. 6 strains gave precipitation zones in the agar and found to be positive. 4 of them were 07:K1:H--, 1, 075:Kq5:H5 and 1, 07:K1:H5.
TI  - Non-neonatal meningitis due to less common bacterial pathogens, the Netherlands,  1975-83.
AB  - In the Netherlands, case histories of 160 patients aged more than 1 month, with meningitis due to bacteria other than Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were reviewed in order to look for associations between the bacteriological data and the course of disease. The incidence of such cases was about 0.8/100,000/year. Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes each accounted for about 15% of the cases. The case-fatality rate was 18.8% (Gram-negative bacteria, 25%; Gram-positives, 15%) and sequelae occurred in 13.3% of the surviving patients (14 and 13% Gram-negative and Gram-positive, respectively). Hearing loss was the most prevalent sequela (5.0%). Predisposing factors were present in 70% of patients (69 and 71% respectively), especially in meningitis due to enteric Gram-negative bacteria (except for salmonella) and due to staphylococci. Surveillance is important because the incidence of meningitis due to these micro-organisms is likely to increase and because the problems in antibiotic treatment have not yet been solved.
TI  - Chloroalanyl antibiotic peptides: antagonism of their antimicrobial effects by L-alanine and L-alanyl peptides in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A large number of structurally diverse di- and tripeptides containing the alanine racemase inactivator beta-chloro-L-alanine (beta-Cl-LAla) have been synthesized, and their antibacterial properties in vitro have been evaluated. The dipeptides 1, 3-6, and 8-17 and the tripeptide 20 are all broad-spectrum antibacterial agents with considerable potency against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative species, but none of these peptides improves dramatically on the antibiotic efficacy of the previously described beta-Cl-LAla-beta-Cl-LAla, 9 (Cheung, K. S.; Wasserman, S. A.; Dudek, E.; Lerner, S. A.; Johnston, M. J. Med. Chem. 1983, 26, 1733). Gram-negative microorganisms, such as Escherichia coli, Hemophilus influenzae, Shigella flexneri, and Enterobacter species are consistently resistant to any haloalanyl peptide containing an alanyl residue, such as the dipeptide LAla-beta-Cl-LAla (2) and the tripeptides LMet-LAla-beta-Cl-LAla (7), LAla-LAla-beta-Cl-LAla (18), and LVal-LAla-beta-Cl-LAla (19). Correspondingly, these same organisms are protected from the bactericidal effects of 9 by supplementation of the growth medium with LAla or LAla-LAla. Escherichia coli JSR-O exposed to 9, but protected from lysis by sucrose stabilization, has only about 10% the normal level of intracellular alanine racemase activity. But when these cells are cultured in the presence of 9 with LAla supplementation, or in the presence of 2 with no supplementation, the alanine racemase levels are only about 20-30% below control values. These findings suggest that the resistance of Gram-negative species to chloroalanyl peptides containing alanyl units arises from the ability of LAla to protect the targeted racemase from inactivation by beta-Cl-LAla in vivo, an event which otherwise leads to cell death and lysis. Inactivation of alanine racemase in Gram-positive organisms appears not to be the cellular event that confers sensitivity of these species to a haloalanyl peptide.
TI  - Paediatric meningitis in the western Cape. A 3-year hospital-based prospective survey.
AB  - Between July 1981 and June 1984 1223 cases of meningitis were seen in the Department of Paediatrics, Tygerberg Hospital. The commonest form in each population group was aseptic meningitis. Positive viral cultures were obtained from the CSF in 108 cases. The median age of white children with aseptic meningitis, 64 months, was significantly greater than that of coloured children, 45 months (P greater than 0.0001), and black children, 26 months (P greater than 0.014). The commonest cause of confirmed bacterial meningitis was Neisseria meningitidis (140 cases; 11.5%), which continues to affect mainly young coloured children (median age 16.9 months). Resistance to sulphonamides was found among 21% of 114 N. meningitidis isolates. Among white children Haemophilus influenzae was responsible for 9 of the 18 cases of confirmed bacterial meningitis. Tuberculosis was responsible for 62 cases of meningitis (5%) and was a commoner cause of meningitis than either H. influenzae (47 cases) or Streptococcus pneumoniae (34 cases). Thirty-four confirmed cases of bacterial meningitis were seen in children less than 1 month old. Klebsiella species were responsible for 8 cases (24%), Escherichia coli for 6 cases (12%), group B beta-haemolytic Streptococcus for 5 cases (15%) while 4 cases each were due to N. meningitidis and Strept. pneumoniae.

TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of two oral cephalosporins, ceftetrame (Ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (Ro 15-8074).
AB  - Ceftetrame (Ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (Ro 15-8074), two new orally administered aminothiazolyl imimomethoxy cephalosporins, inhibited hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml but were less active against staphylococci than were cephalexin and cefaclor. They did not inhibit S. faecalis, S. faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Corynebacterium JK species, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, including ampicillin-resistant isolates, were inhibited at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml. Both agents inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, Shigella species, Citrobacter diversus, and Aeromonas hydrophila resistant to ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, although many isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime were not inhibited by these agents. A marked inoculum effect was noted for Enterobacteriaceae carrying the Richmond-Sykes type 1A chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, but plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases did not hydrolyze the compounds. Both drugs inhibited the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of E. cloacae, P99.
TI  - Establishment of beta-hydroxy fatty acids as chemical marker molecules for bacterial endotoxin by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
AB  - Selected ion-monitoring gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used for detection of beta-hydroxy fatty acids as an independent assay for the presence or absence of endotoxin in materials claimed to induce nonspecific activation of Limulus amoebocyte lysate. To this end, suspensions of gram-negative and -positive bacteria, one fungal species, cerebrospinal fluid, and hollow-fiber hemodialyzer rinses were assayed for endotoxin by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and the Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay. Good qualitative agreement was shown for both methods when suspensions of test organisms were assayed. Two false-negative results were obtained by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry assays of cerebrospinal fluid and were shown to be a result of insufficient endotoxin in the cerebrospinal fluid specimens for detection by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Hemodialyzer rinses were Limulus assay positive; however, no beta-hydroxy fatty acids were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. These data were compared with data obtained from USP rabbit pyrogen tests of the rinse materials (nonpyrogenic) and chemical characterization of the Limulus assay-reactive rinses, which showed the rinses to be cellulosic in nature. It is suggested that beta-hydroxy fatty acids, as assayed by selected ion-monitoring gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, be used as chemical marker molecules for the presence or absence of endotoxin in materials reported to cause nonspecific activation of Limulus amoebocyte lysate.

TI  - Sepsis and cholestasis: the in vitro effects of bacterial products on 14C-taurocholate uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.
AB  - Bacterial endotoxins are known to be an important cause of cholestasis, yet not all organisms that cause cholestasis produce endotoxins. In order to determine whether bacterial products other than endotoxins may be involved in the cholestasis process, 14C-taurocholate (TC) uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes was measured in the presence of mid-log, stationary and mid-death phase bacterial broth supernatants from eight common bacterial pathogens. The results were then correlated with a quantitative assessment of endotoxin production by each organism. Supernatants from Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumonia demonstrated a striking inhibitory effect on bile salt uptake (77.2 +/- 6.7, 46.9 +/- 6.5 and 32.9 +/- 7.1% maximum inhibition of 14C-TC uptake, respectively) when compared to sterile broth controls. Streptococcus faecalis (Enterococcus), Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacteroides fragilis products, on the other hand, had relatively minor effects (12.3 +/- 5.2, 12.0 +/- 7.5, 8.4 +/- 6.7 and less than 5.0% inhibition respectively), while those from Proteus mirabilis had an intermediate effect (18.5 +/- 8.3% inhibition). Bile salt efflux rates (16.0 +/- 2.7 and 25.1 +/- 4.2 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, mean +/- SEM) were similar in bacteria demonstrating marked uptake inhibition (Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) when compared to those with only minor inhibitory effects (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis) (14.3 +/- 1.1 and 18.4 +/- 2.6 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, respectively, p greater than 0.05). 14C-TC uptake inhibition did not correlate with the amount of endotoxin produced by each organism (r = 0.251). The results of this study indicate that bacteria produce a factor other than endotoxin that significantly inhibits bile salt uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Emergence of beta-lactamase producing anaerobic bacteria in the tonsils during penicillin treatment.
AB  - The emergence of beta-lactamase producing bacteria in the microflora in the oropharyngeal cavity was studied in ten healthy volunteers treated with 1 g phenoxymethylpenicillin b.i.d. for ten days. Beta-lactamase activity in saliva was also investigated. A significant increase in the number of beta-lactamase producing strains of Bacteroides species and Fusobacterium nucleatum was observed. One beta-lactamase producing Staphylococcus aureus strain was recovered in one of the volunteers before the penicillin administration started and three Staphylococcus aureus strains produced beta-lactamase after ten days of antibiotic treatment. Beta-lactamase-production in Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae or Branhamella catarrhalis was not observed before, during or after the antibiotic treatment. Beta-lactamase activity was noted in the broth cultures from one volunteer colonized with a beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli strain. Beta-lactamase activity in saliva was observed in all volunteers, the activity increasing significantly in parallel to the increase of beta-lactamase producing bacterial strains. Beta-lactamase activity in saliva was completely inhibited in vitro by clavulanic acid and p-chloromercurbenzoate and about 70-80 per cent of the activity was inhibited by cefoxitin. The increase of beta-lactamase producing bacteria in the oropharynx as a consequence of penicillin treatment raises doubt as to whether penicillin is the drug of choice in the treatment of tonsillitis caused by group A streptococci when previous treatment has failed.
TI  - Application of multilocus enzyme gel electrophoresis to Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis was adapted to the study of Haemophilus influenzae. Protein extracts from sonicated whole bacteria were subjected to starch gel electrophoresis. After staining with substrates, the position of each isoenzyme (electromorph) was registered. Each isolate was assigned an electrophoretic type (ET) by the combination of electromorphs for the enzymes stained. Twenty-seven enzymes were tested; 12 were expressed in H. influenzae. Six enzymes were selected for subsequent study: malate dehydrogenase (MDH), phenylalanylleucine peptidase (PE2), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PG), adenylate kinase (AK), glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P), and phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI). They were polymorphic and occurred in all isolates. Six electromorphs were found for PE2, G6P, and PGI, five for MDH, four for 6PG, and three for AK. PE2, G6P, and PGI contributed most of the ET resolution (48 of 49 ETs). Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis showed several advantages over previous typing techniques. An ET could be assigned to both typable and nontypable (NT) isolates. The technique was powerful in resolving differences among isolates. The 94 isolates comprised 49 ETs, five biotypes, and six capsular types and NT isolates. Strains known to be related expressed the same ET, e.g., RAB b+ and b-, ET12; Ma a+ and a-, ET1. ET variability among type b isolates was low; 26 of 28 clinical isolates expressed ET14; 2 of 28 expressed ET13 and ET15, differing from ET14 by one electromorph each. In contrast, the 47 NT isolates comprised 38 different ETs. No ETs were shared between non-type b capsulated strains and type b or NT strains. Interestingly, five NT isolates expressed the same ET as type b strains. (iv) Strains of the same capsular type but different biotypes expressed different ETs. ET determinations will thus be useful in studying the epidemiology and evolution of H. influenzae.
TI  - Difference in structure between type b and nontypable Haemophilus influenzae populations.
AB  - The extent of chromosomal genetic variability and the genetic structure of Haemophilus influenzae populations was analyzed. A total of 119 isolates from humans in Goteborg, Sweden, and Birmingham, Ala., and 16 strains from a type culture collection were characterized for capsular type, biotype, outer membrane protein profile, and enzyme electrophoretic type (ET). The results of this study indicate that the bacteria identified as H. influenzae are a genetically extremely variable array of organisms. For the six enzymes studied, the estimated mean genetic diversity was 0.57 (approximately 20% higher than the corresponding estimate for Escherichia coli). Two lines of evidence indicate that despite its ability to recombine by transformation, H. influenzae maintains a largely clonal population structure. Although there is considerable potential for generating different genotypes, there were only 88 distinct ETs among the 135 strains, and isolates of the same ET and biotype were recovered at frequencies greater than would be anticipated at random. This evidence for a clonal population structure holds for uncapsulated as well as capsulated strains. However, these data also suggest that the stability of H. influenzae clones (clone persistence time) may be less than that of the nontransforming species E. coli. The ET data indicate that there is somewhat less variability among H. influenzae strains that express the same capsular antigens, biotype, and outer membrane proteins than among randomly chosen isolates. Nevertheless, there is substantial genetic variation among isolates within each of these classes and combinations thereof. There is also variation in these typing characteristics among strains of the same ET. These observations and those on genetic variability and population structures have implications for the characterization of H. influenzae isolates in clinical and epidemiological studies.
TI  - Penicillin-binding proteins and the antibacterial effectiveness of beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - It is currently believed that both the antibacterial potency and the nature of the antibacterial effects of beta-lactam antibiotics are ultimately dependent on the inhibition (acylation) of one or more of the bacterial penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Nevertheless, bacterial factors (e.g., autolysins) that do not directly react with the antibiotic molecule also profoundly influence the fate (inhibition of growth or lysis) of the antibiotic-treated bacterial cell. The quantitative relationship between the minimal inhibitory concentration of a beta-lactam antibiotic and its reactivity with certain PBPs is not well understood. Also poorly understood is the mechanism by which inhibition of PBP function causes triggering of suicidal autolytic activity. Much remains to be done before the structural basis of the highly selective PBP affinities observed with some beta-lactam antibiotics is understood. A new form of antibiotic resistance involving mutational alteration of PBPs (in the direction of lower antibiotic affinity) has emerged among clinical isolates of most of the major human pathogens.
TI  - Molecular cloning of DNA coding for outer membrane proteins of Haemophilus influenzae type b.
AB  - DNA from Haemophilus influenzae type b was cloned in Escherichia coli with a vector lambda gt11 Amp1. Clones producing antigens reactive with hyperimmune rabbit antisera were identified by colony radioimmune assay. A second screening with hyperimmune serum adsorbed with intact H. influenzae type b bacteria was used to identify those clones producing surface-exposed outer membrane proteins. The proteins expressed in E. coli were coupled to Sepharose and used to affinity purify antibodies which were tested for reactivity with outer membrane vesicles. It was found by Western blotting that the clones were producing antigens corresponding to Mr 49,000, 39,500, and 35,000 major outer membrane protein or antigens of H. influenzae type b. Additional clones could be detected by human serum, but their reactivity was not removed when serum was adsorbed with intact bacteria. One of these studied in more detail was found to produce an antigen present in H. influenzae type b lysate but not in outer membrane vesicle preparations.

TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of AM-833, a new quinolone derivative.
AB  - AM-833 showed potent activity against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Neisseria spp., and Haemophilus influenzae and good activity against staphylococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Branhamella catarrhalis. Against these bacteria, its activity was roughly comparable to that of norfloxacin and ofloxacin but was slightly less potent than that of ciprofloxacin. This compound also showed good activity against drug-resistant strains such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and gentamicin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The protective effects of a single oral dose of AM-833 on systemic bacterial infections in mice were greater than those of norfloxacin. AM-833 was as effective as ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against systemic infections with Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and it showed somewhat higher activity against staphylococcal infections than did the other quinolones. AM-833 exhibited good prophylactic activity against E. coli infections. AM-833 also proved effective against localized infections such acute pneumonia and ascending urinary tract infections in mice. The excellent therapeutic efficacy of AM-833 against these systemic and local infections may be a result of its good oral absorption and high levels in tissues.
TI  - Once daily ceftriaxone for central nervous system infections and other serious pediatric infections.
AB  - Ceftriaxone has a very long serum half-life and enhanced in vitro activity against common pediatric pathogens. Therefore we evaluated the efficacy and safety of once daily ceftriaxone therapy in 57 children with serious infections including: meningitis (26 patients); ventriculitis (3); pyelonephritis (7); osteomyelitis (6); abscess (4); septic arthritis (3); sepsis (2); and miscellaneous infections (6). The most common isolates were Haemophilus influenzae (23), Escherichia coli (9) and Staphylococcus aureus (8). Ceftriaxone was given intravenously or intramuscularly in a dose of 50 mg/kg for non-central nervous system (CNS) infections. Patients with CNS infections received an initial dose of 100 mg/kg followed by 80 mg/kg 12 hours later and once daily thereafter. In a limited number of patients no major differences in serum ceftriaxone concentrations were found after intravenous or intramuscular injection. Of 57 patients with pathogens isolated 55 were completely cured; in one patient with Klebsiella pneumoniae ventriculitis, intraventricular gentamicin was briefly added to the regimen. Another patient with an anaerobic liver abscess recovered after metronidazole was administered. In three patients a delayed response to ceftriaxone was noted. One patient with previous recurrent infections had a second episode of H. influenzae meningitis 22 days after cessation of therapy. Clinical side effects were noted in 10 of 71 patients (including 14 treated patients who had negative cultures). Seven patients had diarrhea, one each had fever or rash and one had fever, rash and arthralgia. Laboratory side effects in 16 of 71 patients included eosinophilia (7), thrombocytosis (7), elevated liver enzymes (4) and leukopenia and neutropenia (2).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In-vitro activity of ticarcillin with and without clavulanic acid against clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of ticarcillin with and without clavulanic acid was investigated against 285 freshly isolated clinical strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by the agar-dilution technique on Mueller-Hinton-agar. Clavulanic acid had an excellent or moderate potentiating effect on the in-vitro activity of ticarcillin against staphylococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter spp., Acinetobacter, Haemophilus influenzae and Bacteroides spp. No effect was seen against enterococci, indole-positive Proteus spp., Ent. cloacae, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The effect of clavulanic acid was dose- and inoculum-dependent.
TI  - An infant with simultaneous beta-lactamase-positive Haemophilus influenzae meningitis and beta-lactamase-negative H. influenzae septicemia, Escherichia coli pyelonephritis and herpes encephalitis.
AB  - We describe an infant with meningitis and septicemia due to infection with two different strains of Haemophilus influenzae, with a urinary tract infection due to Escherichia coli and in whom herpes virus encephalitis was diagnosed within three days. Acinetobacter calcoaceticus septicemia developed three weeks later. No immunological deficiency could be demonstrated in the patient who recovered finally, albeit with sequelae due to encephalitis.
TI  - Quantitative and qualitative analyses of serum antibodies elicited in adults by Haemophilus influenzae type b and pneumococcus type 6A capsular polysaccharide-tetanus toxoid conjugates.
AB  - Covalent binding to immunogenic proteins increases the immunogenicity of the capsular polysaccharides of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and pneumococcus type 6A (Pn6A). Conjugates composed of Hib, Pn6A, or the cross-reacting Escherichia coli K100 covalently bound to tetanus toxoid (TT) were injected into young adult volunteers. Local reactions were common and were probably due to Arthus reactivity mediated by the preexisting antibodies reacting with the TT component of the conjugates. Fever occurred in about 10% of the volunteers after the first injection; no volunteers had fever after the second injection. Similar levels of Hib or Pn6A antibodies were elicited by either 50- or 100-micrograms doses or by concurrent injection of two different conjugates (Hib-TT and Pn6A-TT or Hib-TT and K100-TT). The Hib-TT elicited about a 180-fold increase in Hib antibodies, and the Pn6A-TT conjugate elicited about an 8-fold increase in Pn6A antibodies after one injection. Booster reactions were not elicited in adults; similar levels of antibodies in the five experimental groups suggested that the responses elicited by the conjugates were maximal. A one-way cross-reaction was noted as Pn6A conjugates elicited rises of Hib antibodies in 13 of 20 volunteers; only 4 of 59 volunteers immunized with Hib-TT had increases in Pn6A antibodies. The preimmunization Hib antibodies were composed of immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgA, and IgG. The postimmunization sera showed an increase in all three isotypes; the elevation of the IgG was the highest of the three isotypes. Conjugate-induced antibodies to both the polysaccharide and TT exerted biological activities that have been correlated with immunity. Adsorption of the Hib-TT onto aluminium hydroxide resulted in higher levels and an earlier Hib antibody response in infant rhesus. These results encourage the evaluation of Hib and Pn6A conjugates in human children and infants.
TI  - Morphologic alterations of the blood-brain barrier with experimental meningitis in the rat. Temporal sequence and role of encapsulation.
AB  - The cerebral capillary endothelium is unique and functions as an effective blood-brain barrier (BBB) owing to its intercellular tight junctions and rare pinocytotic vesicles. To assess how bacterial meningitis alters the BBB, rats were inoculated intracisternally with three encapsulated meningeal pathogens (Escherichia coli K1+, Streptococcus pneumoniae type III, Haemophilus influenzae type b) and an unencapsulated mutant strain (H. influenzae Rd). After defined infection durations, the morphologic alterations of the cerebral capillary endothelium were quantitatively assessed by transmission electron microscopy. Results revealed a significant increase in pinocytotic vesicle formation (P less than 0.001) early after meningitis induction (4 h) that was sustained with longer infection durations (10 h, 18 h) for all encapsulated strains tested. In addition, there was a progressive increase in completely separated intercellular junctions with increasing infection duration, (P less than 0.05). 4 h after induction of meningitis with H. influenzae Rd, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) bacterial concentrations, cerebral capillary morphologic changes, and functional BBB permeability to circulating 125I-albumin were similar to those observed with H. influenzae type b. However, prolonging the H. influenzae Rd infection to 18 h allowed for CSF clearance of the organism, thereby precluding the significant increase in separated junctions or progression of functional BBB permeability seen with the encapsulated H. influenzae type b. These data suggest a uniform morphologic explanation for altered BBB permeability in meningitis with a reproducible temporal sequence. Encapsulation does not appear essential for BBB injury, but may facilitate its progression by allowing the organism to evade host clearance.
TI  - Variation in the potentiation of beta-lactam antibiotic activity by clavulanic acid and sulbactam against multiply antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - Using a broth microdilution method, we studied 120 strains of beta-lactamase-producing clinical isolates to determine the potentiating effect of clavulanic acid and sulbactam (both beta-lactamase inhibitors) on the antibacterial activity of a variety of beta-lactam antibiotics. All antibiotics were tested alone and in combination with each inhibitor simultaneously using low (10(5) cfu/ml) and high (10(7) cfu/ml) inocula. Against the strains of Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae the addition of both inhibitors significantly potentiated the activity of most antibiotics at the low inoculum. At the high inoculum, however, this effect was abrogated against E. coli and most strains of H. influenzae. Antibiotic activity was significantly enhanced by the inhibitors at both inoculum sizes with Bacteroides fragilis. Antibiotic resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was little affected by the inhibitors. Among methicillin-resistant staphylococci, antibiotic potentiation by the inhibitors was more significant for Staphylococcus aureus than the coagulase-negative staphylococci.
TI  - [Elimination of Klebsiella pneumoniae and humoral immunity in immunization with the IS-4 immunostimulating mixture].
AB  - The present investigation has revealed that in mice, immunized with preparation HC-4 (an immunostimulating agent consisting of water-soluble antigenic complexes obtained from 4 opportunistic microorganisms: Klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus, Proteus and Escherichia coli K-100 having a common antigen with Haemophilus influenzae) and challenged with K. pneumoniae culture on day 7 after immunization, the complete elimination of K. pneumoniae from the blood occurs within 24 hours. The subcutaneous immunization of rabbits with the above preparation leads to a significant increase in antibody titers, determined in the passive hemagglutination test with Klebsiella diagnosticum. The test of the passive protection of mice from Klebsiella sepsis has revealed a rise in the preventive activity of the sera of rabbits immunized with this preparation.
TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of a gene encoding nonenzymatic chloramphenicol resistance from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - High-level chloramphenicol resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa may be due to enzymatic inactivation, ribosomal mutation, or a permeability barrier. We investigated the nonenzymatic resistance mechanism encoded by Tn1696, a transposon found in P. aeruginosa. A 1-megadalton DNA fragment from Tn1696 was cloned which mediated expression of chloramphenicol resistance in Escherichia coli. Comparison of the effects of chloramphenicol on in vitro translation revealed no difference between the susceptible recipient strain and the resistant transformant containing the cloned gene. The rate of chloramphenicol uptake was slower in the resistant strain, suggesting a permeability barrier to the antibiotic. In addition, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of outer membranes demonstrated the absence of a 50,000-dalton protein in the resistant strain. DNA homology was evident between Tn1696 and chloramphenicol-resistant isolates of Haemophilus influenzae possessing altered outer membrane permeability. We conclude that chloramphenicol resistance encoded by Tn1696 is due to a permeability barrier and hypothesize that the gene from P. aeruginosa may share a common ancestral origin with these genes from other gram-negative organisms.

AB  - Haemophilus influenzae type b (HIB) and Escherichia coli J5 (J5) lipopolysaccharides (LPS) were examined to explore the basis of previously observed cross-protection. HIB-LPS and J5-LPS contained ketodeoxyoctonate, glucose, glucoheptose and glucosamine as common carbohydrate moieties, and laurate, myristate, beta-hydroxymyristate and palmitate as common fatty acids, although in different ratios. J5-LPS was five times more lethal than HIB-LPS for chick embryos. Weak serological cross-reactivity was observed by haemagglutination and two-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis. No significant cross-reactivity was demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent or toxicity-neutralisation assays. The cross-reactivity observed between HIB-LPS and J5-LPS was probably due to common components in the core glycolipid.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of A-56619 (difloxacin) and A-56620: new aryl-fluoroquinolones.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial potencies of A-56619 and A-56620, two new aryl-fluoroquinolones, were compared with the potency of norfloxacin against a broad spectrum of organisms. Cefotaxime, aztreonam, piperacillin, imipenem, penicillin, and gentamicin were also tested for reference purposes. The MICs required to inhibit at least 90% of the strains tested ranged from 0.25 to 4 micrograms/ml for A-56619 and from 0.06 to 0.5 microgram/ml for A-56620 for members of the Enterobacteriaceae. A-56619 was generally twofold less potent and A-56620 was twofold more potent than norfloxacin against most aerobic gram-negative bacilli, including members of the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against indole-positive Proteus, Morganella, Providencia rettgeri, and Serratia strains, A-56619 was at least 8- to 16-fold less potent than norfloxacin. A-56619 and A-56620 were four- to eightfold more potent than norfloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus and equally potent to fourfold more potent against Streptococcus species, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The MICs of A-56619 and A-56620 were only slightly affected by increased inoculum size or by the addition of various cations at physiologic concentrations. A-56619 was three- to fivefold less active at pH 8.0 than at pH 6.5 or 7.2. A-56620 was twofold less active at pH 6.5 than at pH 8.0 or 7.2 against members of the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; similar pH variations did not affect A-56620 activity against gram-positive cocci. The potencies of A-56619, A-56620, and norfloxacin were less in urine than in Mueller-Hinton broth; however, this effect was more pronounced with norfloxacin. Human serum at a concentration of 50% caused a 4- to 64- fold decrease in the potency of A-56619 and an average 4-fold decrease in the potency of A-56620, compared with no effect on the potency of norfloxacin. A-56619, A-56620, and norfloxacin were bactericidal and, at four times the MIC, reduced the viable cell counts of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by approximately 99.9% within 2 h. A-56619, A-56620, and norfloxacin showed no significant synergistic activity and no antagonism when they were aminoglycoside or beta-lactam antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Genes involved in Haemophilus influenzae type b capsule expression are part of an 18-kilobase tandem duplication.
AB  - Encapsulated Haemophilus influenzae type b produce nonencapsulated variants at high frequency (0.1-0.3%). Cosmid cloning was used to investigate the genetic mechanism responsible for this instability. Analysis of three independently derived cosmid clones showed that the b+ parental strain contains an 18-kilobase tandem duplication of genes involved in type b capsule expression. Loss of one complete copy of the 18-kilobase tandem duplication occurred following transformation of the cosmid clones into Rec+, but not Rec-, Escherichia coli, and in H. influenzae strains that had spontaneously lost capsule expression. These results suggest that high-frequency loss of type b capsule expression is due to rec-dependent recombination between the two copies of the 18-kilobase tandem repeat. This is further supported by our finding that introduction of the H. influenzae rec-1 mutation stabilized type b capsule expression.
TI  - An analysis of blood culture isolates from 7 South African teaching hospital centres.
AB  - The data on blood culture isolates for 1983 and January - July 1984 reported by the Antibiotic Study Group of South Africa have been analysed to determine national and regional prevalences of different micro-organisms and resistance to certain antibiotics. Although there are significant differences in isolation frequencies between the various centres, overall the five most frequent isolates are Staphylococcus aureus (1983 - 15%; 1984 - 14%), Escherichia coli (13%), Klebsiella spp. (11%; 10%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (9%), and Salmonella typhi (7%; 13%). Staph. aureus ranks first in most centres for 1983 but is displaced in some in 1984 by enteric Gram-negative bacilli. In Durban S. typhi is the most common isolate for the entire period. Methicillin resistance among Staph. aureus is common (approximately 30% overall), especially in the Transvaal. Gentamicin resistance among certain Gram-negative bacilli is a problem in many centres and is especially disturbing in the case of Klebsiella spp., of which over 30% of total isolates are resistant. Ampicillin resistance for Haemophilus influenzae varies from nil to over 30% in different centres, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci are still encountered (nil to over 10%).
TI  - Current state and tendencies of antibiotic resistance in Hungary.
AB  - This survey is based on data for 245 903 isolates reported by Public Health Network laboratories in 1983. Facultatively pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria comprised two-third of the isolates, and--except Escherichia coli--were resistant in a high percent to the most frequently used antibiotics. Oxacillin and vancomycin were the most effective against Staphylococcus aureus being in 94.7% resistant to penicillin. In contrast to other streptococci, all Streptococcus pyogenes strains were sensitive to penicillin. The majority of the Gram-positive strains were resistant to tetracycline. A comparison to results reported earlier (1974 to 1983) showed an increasing resistance rate mainly to ampicillin, carbenicillin, co-trimoxazole and gentamicin, which were introduced in therapy during this period. Resistance rate of almost all species has increased to gentamicin, e.g. that of Proteus mirabilis has risen tenfold. Emergence of Haemophilus influenzae resistant to ampicillin, and increasing resistance rates of P. mirabilis and Streptococcus pneumoniae to almost all drugs are remarkable findings. The increasing or variable usage of drugs that have been used for a long time did not influence resistance markedly. In some instances the resistance rates even diminished, e.g. the tetracycline resistance of agents associated with enteric diseases. A restricted use of chloramphenicol reflected in a decreased resistance of some species. Multiresistant Gram-negative strains--which are resistant to all drugs frequently used in Hungary--were isolated in 12.7% from a representative clinical material. The frequent occurrence of multiresistant P. mirabilis and Acinetobacter isolates is a new phenomenon. Surprisingly, the percentage of multiresistant E. coli strains was very low. Amikacin and netilmicin were found to be the most effective against multiresistant isolates.
TI  - [Treatment of respiratory tract infections with imipenem/cilastatin in critical patients with respiratory insufficiency].
AB  - In an open prospective study the efficacy and tolerance of imipenem/cilastatin was investigated in 24 critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation with nosocomial respiratory tract infection. Nine patients had previously received antibiotic therapy, eight of them with various other beta-lactam antibiotics which had failed. Imipenem was given in a dose of 1-3 g/24 h over 5-37 (mean 11) days. Seven patients were additionally treated with aminoglycosides, one patient with erythromycin. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 14), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 4), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 4) and Escherichia coli (n = 3) were the potential pathogens most frequently isolated from tracheo-bronchial secretions. All of the isolates were susceptible to imipenem. 91% of the infections without and 77% with involvement of P. aeruginosa were successfully treated. Two patients who had not responded to previous treatment succumbed to the consequences of progressive respiratory distress syndrome. All of the gram-positive and 85% of the gram-negative pathogens (Pseudomonas not included) were eliminated in the course of therapy. By contrast, 64% of the isolates of P. aeruginosa persisted; half of these became imipenem-resistant. Nine patients showed adverse reactions including one case of pseudomembranous colitis or laboratory abnormalities which were all reversible. Imipenem/cilastatin proved highly effective and was relatively well tolerated; it is suitable as a single agent for the initial treatment of nosocomial respiratory tract infections in ventilated patients, although only with limitations in cases of infection due to P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Ceftriaxone therapy in otolaryngological and pulmonary infections.
AB  - The efficacy of ceftriaxone, 1 g given intramuscularly once daily, was evaluated  in 38 patients with pneumonia (n = 11), pulmonary empyema (n = 2), bronchitis (n = 4), tonsillitis (n = 9), sinusitis (n = 7), and otitis (n = 5). Causative organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 11), viridans type streptococcus (n = 1), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 6), group A streptococcus (n = 10), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 3), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1), Escherichia coli (n = 2), Proteus mirabilis (n = 1), and Proteus vulgaris (n = 1). Sterilization of infected foci was obtained in 89.4% of those treated, with clinical recovery in 86.8%. The ceftriaxone regimen was well tolerated.
TI  - Comparative activity of ofloxacin with reference to bacterial strains isolated in in-patients and out-patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new quinolone derivative, was compared to that of other agents commonly in use against pathogens isolated in the community and in the hospital. None of the community or hospital strains isolated from urinary tract infection showed resistance to ofloxacin, while variable resistance was demonstrable with all other oral agents. Similar results were obtained with pathogens isolated from infected wounds originating in the community and in the hospital. Among pathogens isolated from the respiratory tract, ofloxacin was most active against Haemophilus influenzae, but less active than the penicillin-cephalosporin group against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Ofloxacin was active against all but one (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) blood culture isolates. Of 112 strains isolated from community-acquired infections, only one strain was ofloxacin-resistant while resistance to sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim, ampicillin and doxycycline was 34%, 42% and 30%, respectively. Among 219 pathogens originating from nosocomial infections, 3.2% were resistant to ofloxacin compared to 56% for cefazolin, to 7.2% for cefotaxime, 15.8% for piperacillin and 22.3% for gentamicin. These results suggest that ofloxacin has great therapeutic potential for the therapy of bacterial infections originating both in the community and in the hospital.
TI  - Kill kinetics of bacteria under fluctuating concentrations of various antibiotics. II. Description of experiments.
AB  - Differences in kill kinetics and regrowth patterns of bacteria under the influence of various antibiotics are frequently not represented by their MIC values. The area under the concentration curve represents antimicrobial activity more accurately than the peak concentration. Readministration of antibiotics should occur prior to bacterial regrowth for optimal efficacy. When administering antibiotics in combinations nonsimultaneous dosing is superior to simultaneous administration.
TI  - Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of antibacterial phosphonopeptides incorporating (1-aminoethyl)phosphonic acid and (aminomethyl)phosphonic acid.
AB  - Phosphonodipeptides and phosphonooligopeptides based on L- and D-(1-aminoethyl)phosphonic acids L-Ala(P) and D-Ala(P) and (aminomethyl)phosphonic acid Gly(P) at the acid terminus have been synthesized and investigated as antibacterial agents, which owe their activity to the inhibition of bacterial cell-wall biosynthesis. A method for large-scale synthesis of the potent antibacterial agent L-Ala-L-Ala(P) (1, Alafosfalin) is described. Structure-activity relationships in the dipeptide series have been studied by systematic variation of structure 1. L stereochemistry is generally required for both components. Changes in the L-Ala(P) moiety mostly lead to loss of antibacterial activity, but the phosphonate analogues of L-phenylalanine, L-Phe(P), and L-serine, L-Ser(P), give rise to weakly active L-Ala-L-Phe(P) and L-Ala-L-Ser(P). Replacement of L-Ala in 1 by common and rare amino acids can give rise to more potent in vitro antibacterials such as L-Nva-L-Ala(P) (45). Synthetic variation of these more potent dipeptides leads to decreased activity. Phosphonooligopeptides such as (L-Ala)2-L-Ala(P) have a broader in vitro antibacterial spectrum than their phosphonodipeptide precursor, but this is not expressed in vivo, presumably due to rapid metabolism to 1. Stabilized compounds such as Sar-L-Nva-L-Nva-L-Ala(P) (46) have been developed that are more potent in vivo and have a broader in vivo antibacterial spectrum than the parent phosphonodipeptide.
TI  - Clinical and bacteriological evaluation of Branhamella catarrhalis in respiratory infections.
AB  - The clinical significance of Branhamella catarrhalis in respiratory infections is evaluated. 175 strains were isolated, mainly from the sputum, in 71 patients with respiratory infections. B. catarrhalis was most frequently isolated in mixed infections with Haemophilus influenzae (38.3%), H. influenzae plus Streptococcus pneumoniae (10.3%) or S. pneumoniae (9.7%). The rate of isolation of B. catarrhalis alone was as low as 5.1% and from mixed infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter and/or Klebsiella species it was 36.6%. More than 10(7) cfu/ml of B. catarrhalis were isolated from 71.4% of cases. In 29 cases the organism was determined to be causative according to our criteria, most often in secondary infections in patients with complicated pneumoconiosis, chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis. 29 of 47 strains (61.7%) produced beta-lactamase of the penicillinase type. Against these strains, penicillin antibiotics and first and second generation cephalosporin antibiotics (except cefroxadine) showed weak activity compared with their activity against non-beta-lactamase-producing strains. The third generation cephalosporins showed a uniform spectrum of activity against both groups of organisms.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ofloxacin and its mode of action.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae was comparable to norfloxacin and enoxacin, and far exceeded the activity of pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid. The activity of ofloxacin was two to eight times less than that of ciprofloxacin. Ofloxacin was more active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acinetobacter spp., Legionella spp., and Bacteroides fragilis, than norfloxacin, enoxacin, pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid, and the activity of ofloxacin was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin. Ofloxacin was two to seven times more effective than norfloxacin in systemic infections in mice with S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens and P. aeruginosa. Ofloxacin strongly inhibited DNA supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase purified from E. coli KL-16. There is a parallel relationship between antibacterial activity of ofloxacin and its inhibitory action against DNA gyrases from ofloxacin-susceptible and ofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates of E. coli. These results indicate that the high bactericidal action of ofloxacin and the related new quinolone agents can be explained by their potent inhibitory activities against DNA gyrase in bacterial cells.
TI  - Susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria to the synergistic bactericidal action of serum and polymyxin B nonapeptide.
AB  - Polymyxin B nonapeptide was able to sensitize Escherichia coli strains and strains of Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae to the bactericidal action of fresh normal human serum. The degree of sensitization varied significantly within the strains. Strains of Proteus mirabilis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and N. meningitidis remained resistant.
TI  - Enhancement of growth of aerobic and facultative bacteria in mixed infections with Bacteroides species.
AB  - The potential for mutual enhancement of growth of the Bacteroides fragilis and B. melaninogenicus groups and the aerobic and facultative organisms commonly isolated with them in mixed infections was evaluated. Enhancement was studied by measuring the relative increase in CFU of the two bacterial components inducing subcutaneous abscesses in mice. Of the 42 combinations between three isolates each of the B. fragilis and B. melaninogenicus groups and seven aerobic or facultative organisms, Bacteroides spp. were enhanced in only 8 and inhibited in 4. The aerobic and facultative bacteria were enhanced in 31 of the 42 combinations and depressed in 2. The organisms uniformly enhanced by all of the Bacteroides spp. were group A streptococci and Escherichia coli (all six instances), followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae (five of six instances), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (four instances), group D streptococci (in three instances only by the B. fragilis group), and Haemophilus influenzae (one instance). It is apparent that the growth rate of facultative and aerobic bacteria is enhanced much more in mixed infections with Bacteroides spp. than that of their anaerobic counterparts.
TI  - [Clinical studies on aztreonam in various infections in obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  - Aztreonam (AZT) was administered to 10 patients with obstetric and gynecologic infections to evaluate its clinical effect. Two-four grams of AZT per day (b.i.d.) were administered for the treatment for 4-15 days by intravenous drip infusion or intravenous injection. AZT was effective for 3 cases of pelvic peritonitis, 1 case of pyoovarium and 2 cases of Bartholin's abscess. For 2 cases of intrauterine infection, AZT was effective for 1 case, and the other case could not be judged. For 2 cases of local infection, AZT was effective for 1 case and ineffective for 1 case. Efficacy rate was 89% for the 9 cases excluding the 1 unevaluable case. Microbiological effect was determined for 4 out of 10 cases. Two strains of Haemophilus influenzae and one each of Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis and Streptococcus intermedius were isolated, but all of them were eliminated for a elimination rate of 100%. Neither abnormal laboratory findings in hepatic or renal functions, etc. nor side effects were recognized.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ticarcillin in the presence of clavulanate potassium.
AB  - The antibacterial effects produced by ticarcillin disodium plus clavulanate potassium, a combination of the broad-spectrum penicillin ticarcillin, and the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid as the potassium salt, have been measured in vitro and in experimental infection studies. The presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the activity of ticarcillin against a wide range of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. These included ticarcillin-resistant strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, and the anaerobe Bacteroides fragilis. In addition, beta-lactamase-producing isolates of Hemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ticarcillin and clavulanate. Clavulanic acid did not influence the activity of ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible bacteria. The bactericidal effects of the antibiotic combination were measured in an in vitro kinetic model in which the drug concentrations were varied to simulate those measured in humans after intravenous dosing with ticarcillin (3.0 g) and clavulanate potassium (100 mg clavulanic acid). In these tests, ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid had pronounced bactericidal activity against ticarcillin-resistant bacteria. The protection of ticarcillin by clavulanic acid from inactivation by bacterial beta-lactamases in vivo was demonstrated in experimental infection models in which the efficacy of the ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid combination against infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing bacteria was correlated with the presence of effective concentrations of both antibiotic and inhibitor at the site of infection.
TI  - The pharmacokinetic and bactericidal characteristics of oral cefixime.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of cefixime (FK 027), a broad-spectrum cephalosporin, were assessed in 12 normal subjects after single oral doses of 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg. Mean peak serum concentrations were 1.02, 1.46, 2.63, and 3.85 micrograms/ml after the four respective doses. Respective mean serum levels at 12 hours were 0.16, 0.33, 0.72, and 1.13 micrograms/ml. Volumes of distribution averaged 0.1 L/kg body weight, and the elimination t1/2 was 3 hours for all doses. The AUC was 7.01, 11.4, 22.5, and 36.4 micrograms X hr/ml for the four doses, respectively. Serum clearance averaged 0.4 mg/min/kg and mean 24-hour urinary recovery was 21%, 19%, 20%, and 16% for the four respective doses. Serum bactericidal titers at 4 hours exceeded 1:16 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Hemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis. Urine bactericidal titers exceeded 1:8 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae resistant to the available oral cephalosporins.
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacteria isolated from lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1983)].
AB  - Bacterial isolates from the patients with pulmonary infections have been collected over these 3 years, in collaboration with investigators at 13 hospitals in various parts of Japan for the study on frequency of isolation of pathogens among the patients and their drug susceptibilities. Possible causative pathogens mainly isolated from sputum in patients with lower respiratory tract infections during period from September 1983 to March 1984, were collected. The frequency of bacterial isolates from the sputum and their drug susceptibility on H. influenzae among the various pathogens are discussed. The kinds of bacterial species isolated from the patients with respiratory tract infections associated with chronic bronchitis, chronic capillary bronchitis or bronchiectasis and their relative frequency of isolation were as follows; Total numbers of bacterial isolates collected from various hospitals were 220 strains in 1981, 168 strains 1982 and 258 strains in 1983. H. influenzae was always isolated with highest frequency of 50.5% in 1981, 45.8% in 1982 and 40.7% in 1983, and followed by P. aeruginosa (24.1%), S. aureus (8.2%), S. pneumoniae (7.3%) and K. pneumoniae (5.9%) and E. coli (4.1%) in 1981; P. aeruginosa (30.4%), S. pneumoniae (11.9%), S. aureus (4.8%), K. pneumoniae (3.0%) and E. coli (1.8%) in 1982; P. aeruginosa (26.7%), S. pneumoniae (10.1%), S. aureus (7.8%), K. pneumoniae (3.5%) and E. coli (3.5%) in 1983. The drug susceptibility test of H. influenzae to ampicillin (ABPC), piperacillin (PIPC), mezlocillin (MZPC), sulbenicillin (SBPC), gentamicin (GM), amikacin (AMK), cefotiam (CTM), cefmetazole (CMZ), cefoperazone (CPZ), cefotaxime (CTX), ceftizoxime (CZX), cefmenoxime (CMX) and latamoxef (LMOX) was done by using agar micro-broth dilution methods. H. influenzae was most markedly susceptible to cephems of the third generation, especially to CMX, CZX and CTX by which about 95% of H. influenzae tested were inhibited the growth under the concentration with less than or equal to 0.10 microgram/ml of the drugs. Furthermore, annual changes in susceptibility of H. influenzae to various antibiotics was analyzed over the period from 1981 to 1983. The frequency of S. pneumoniae isolated from patients with chronic bronchitis or bronchiectasis was about 10% in this survey. However, in the case of respiratory infections associated with bacterial pneumonia, the frequencies were as follows; 24.8% (77 cases/311 cases) in 1981, 17.7% (44 cases/248 cases) in 1982, and 11.0% (39 cases/355 cases) in 1983. The frequency of isolation of S. pneumoniae decreased every year.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Comparison of aztreonam and tobramycin in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections caused by gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - A comparison of aztreonam and tobramycin was carried out in 49 hospitalized patients with lower respiratory tract infections caused by gram-negative bacilli. Patients were randomly assigned to the treatment drug. Clindamycin was given concomitantly until the pathogen was identified and the presence of a gram-positive microorganism was ruled out. Samples of sputum were obtained for culture from the lung parenchyma by deep expectoration or transtracheal aspiration. A pathogen was defined as an organism that showed heavy growth and predominated in the culture. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated pathogen, followed by Haemophilus influenzae and Proteus mirabilis. A variety of less common pathogens were represented. Thirty-five patients were treated with intravenous aztreonam (1-2 g every 8 hr) and 14 with intravenous tobramycin (3-5 mg/kg per day) until they were afebrile and sputum cultures had been free of the pathogen for 48 hr. The minimum duration of treatment was five days. In the aztreonam group, only two (5%) of the 37 gram-negative pathogens--one P. aeruginosa and one Escherichia coli--persisted. In the tobramycin group, seven (50%) of the 14 pathogens persisted. Clinical response paralleled microbiologic response. Adverse effects in both treatment groups were minor and transient. In this trial aztreonam was effective and safe for treatment of lower respiratory tract infections caused by P. aeruginosa and a variety of other gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of aztreonam in therapy for experimental bacterial meningitis and cerebritis.
AB  - Aztreonam (SQ 26,776), a new monocyclic beta-lactam agent, was compared with several frequently used antibiotics in therapy for three types of experimental meningitis in rabbits and for experimental Escherichia coli cerebritis in rats. Aztreonam was highly active against common gram-negative meningeal pathogens in vitro (all minimal bactericidal concentrations less than or equal to 0.125 microgram/ml), including ampicillin-sensitive and ampicillin-resistant strains of Haemophilus influenzae, E. coli, and meningococci. In both rabbits and rats, serum concentrations of all antibiotics evaluated closely approximated concentrations found in humans receiving standard parenteral regimens. The percent penetration of aztreonam into purulent rabbit cerebrospinal fluid was 23%. In experimental meningitis, aztreonam was more rapidly bactericidal than ampicillin in meningitis due to ampicillin-sensitive H. influenzae, than ampicillin or chloramphenicol in meningitis due to ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae, and than gentamicin in meningitis due to E. coli. Aztreonam also reduced concentrations of E. coli in rat brain as rapidly as did gentamicin during therapy for experimental cerebritis, the early stage of brain abscess formation.
TI  - Aztreonam: antibacterial activity, beta-lactamase stability, and interpretive standards and quality control guidelines for disk-diffusion susceptibility tests.
AB  - In vitro activity of aztreonam was compared with that of ceftazidime, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, piperacillin, and ticarcillin against 656 representative bacterial pathogens. Aztreonam was not active against gram-positive cocci but was as active as the third-generation cephalosporins against the Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Additional data for 5,262 gram-negative bacilli isolated in four separate medical centers documented the low incidence of resistance to aztreonam; 97.2% of 4,312 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and 79% of 854 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms of aztreonam/ml. Additional studies confirmed the stability of aztreonam in the presence of seven different beta-lactamases. For disk-diffusion susceptibility tests, 30-micrograms disks are recommended, with interpretive breakpoints of less than or equal to 15 mm for resistance (MIC greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml), 16-21 mm for intermediate susceptibility (MIC, 16 micrograms/ml), and greater than or equal to 22 mm for susceptibility (MIC less than 8.0 micrograms/ml). For quality control of tests with 30-micrograms disks, zone-size limits for Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) should be 28-36 mm and those for P. aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) should be 23-29 mm.
TI  - Imipenem/cilastatin for the treatment of infections in hospitalized children.
AB  - Imipenem is the first of a new class of beta-lactam antimicrobial agents with potent in vitro activity against most bacterial pathogens that cause infections in children. We studied, prospectively, the clinical efficacy and toxicity of imipenem/cilastatin in 40 children with proved or suspected bacterial infection. A dose of 100 mg/kg/day of imipenem was given to children younger than 3 years of age, while children older than 3 years of age received 60 mg/kg/day. Twenty-nine organisms were isolated from 26 patients. Infections treated included cellulitis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, lymphadenitis, renal infections, wound infections, and pneumonia. Bacteria isolated included Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All patients responded favorably to treatment, with defervescence and improvement of symptoms. All of the infecting bacteria were susceptible to imipenem. Imipenem/cilastatin was well tolerated, with no serious side effects, and appeared to be an effective and safe antimicrobial agent in the treatment of the population studied.
TI  - Genes from plasmid pKM101 in Haemophilus influenzae: separation of functions of mucA and mucB.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae, normally not mutable by UV, became UV mutable with a recombinant plasmid insertion. A 7.8-kilobase-pair (kbp) fragment of the plasmid pKM101 containing the mucA and mucB genes was ligated to the shuttle vector pDM2, and a Rec- strain of H. influenzae was transformed with the ligated mixture. All of the transformants, unlike the parent Rec- strain, were resistant to UV, could carry out postreplication repair and Weigle reactivation, showed greatly increased spontaneous mutation, and contained a plasmid carrying an insert of only 1.2 rather than 7.8 kbp. This plasmid in a umuC mutant strain of Escherichia coli complemented a pKM101 derivative lacking mucA function but with an intact mucB gene, although there was no complementation with a mucA+ mucB- plasmid, suggesting that the newly constructed plasmid coded for the mucA protein; this is in accord with the restriction analysis and hybridization between the plasmid and a probe containing all of the mucA gene but only a small fraction of mucB. When one of the H. influenzae Rec- transformants lost the plasmid, the resistance to UV was retained but the high spontaneous mutation and UV mutability were not. The fact that there was hybridization between the chromosome of the "cured" strain and a probe containing both muc genes but none when almost no mucB was present suggested that at least part of the mucB gene had been integrated into the Rec- chromosome. Five different postreplication repair-proficient strains became UV mutable and had high spontaneous mutation rates caused by the putative mucA plasmid, indicating that these strains already possessed a chromosomal equivalent of the mucB gene.
TI  - Reliability of cefaclor, cefazolin, cefamandole, and cephalothin disks to predict susceptibility of Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus species, and Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Interpretive zone-size standards currently used for cephalothin and cefamandole disk tests also may be applied to tests with disks containing 30 micrograms of cefaclor or cefazolin. Against 627 representative isolates, susceptibility to cefaclor and cefazolin could be predicted by testing cephalothin. However, cefazolin is more active than cephalothin against isolates of Escherichia coli with a TEM beta-lactamase plasmid. The expanded spectrum of cefamandole continues to necessitate separate testing. Against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, cefaclor disks were more reliable than cephalothin or cefamandole, but false-susceptible results were seen with all four disks. For testing Haemophilus influenzae, the cefazolin disks were not reliable; cephalothin or cefaclor disks could predict susceptibility to either drug.
TI  - Low frequency of bacterial resistance to enoxacin in vitro and in experimental pneumonia.
AB  - The tendency for bacteria to develop resistance to enoxacin (Cl-919, AT-2266), a  new oxyquinolone derivative, was investigated in vitro and in vivo. The mutation frequencies of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., and Haemophilus influenzae to enoxacin, norfloxacin, nalidixic acid, tobramycin, cephalexin, cefotaxime, ampicillin, azlocillin, oxacillin, and ticarcillin were determined by plating large numbers of organisms onto antibiotic-containing agar. Enoxacin resistance developed infrequently. For example, the mutation frequency of Ps. aeruginosa in the presence of enoxacin was 1 in 2.8 X 10(9) cells as compared to 1 in 1.1 X 10(6) for nalidixic acid. The increase in MIC after serial transfer through increasing concentrations of enoxacin ranged from 8-fold for Ps. aeruginosa and Staph. aureus to 256-fold for H. influenzae. Rats with chronic Ps. aeruginosa pneumonia were given subtherapeutic doses of enoxacin daily for ten weeks. Two rats were sacrificed weekly and the homogenized lungs were cultured on agar containing 5 mg/l of enoxacin and on antibiotic-free agar. No organisms resistant to 5 mg/l of enoxacin were recovered. No increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration of enoxacin for the infecting organism was seen.
TI  - Mutations affecting gyrase in Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Mutants separately resistant to novobiocin, coumermycin, nalidixic acid, and oxolinic acid contained gyrase activity as measured in vitro that was resistant to the antibiotics, indicating that the mutations represented structural alterations of the enzyme. One Novr mutant contained an altered B subunit of the enzyme, as judged by the ability of a plasmid, pNov1, containing the mutation to complement a temperature-sensitive gyrase B mutation in Escherichia coli and to cause novobiocin resistance in that strain. Three other Novr mutations did not confer antibiotic resistance to the gyrase but appeared to increase the amount of active enzyme in the cell. One of these, novB1, could only act in cis, whereas a new mutation, novC, could act in trans. An RNA polymerase mutation partially substituted for the novB1 mutation, suggesting that novB1 may be a mutation in a promoter region for the B subunit gene. Growth responses of strains containing various combinations of mutations on plasmids or on the chromosome indicated that low-level resistance to novobiocin or coumermycin may have resulted from multiple copies of wild-type genes coding for the gyrase B subunit, whereas high-level resistance required a structural change in the gyrase B gene and was also dependent on alteration in a regulatory region. When there was mismatch at the novB locus, with the novB1 mutation either on a plasmid or the chromosome, and the corresponding wild-type gene present in trans, chromosome to plasmid recombination during transformation was much higher than when the genes matched, probably because plasmid to chromosome recombination, eliminating the plasmid, was inhibited by the mismatch.
TI  - Cross-reactivity of rabbit antibodies to lipopolysaccharides of Escherichia coli  J5 and other gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Antiserum to rough gram-negative mutants such as Escherichia coli J5 and Salmonella minnesota Re595 is thought to neutralize the toxic effects of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs). To verify that such antisera are capable of binding heterologous endotoxins, we examined IgG and IgM class antibodies induced in rabbits to a variety of LPSs. Immunization with rough mutants or lipid A induced high IgG antibody responses to the homologous purified LPS and relatively low but significant responses to heterologous LPSs. Increases in IgM antibodies were also primarily to homologous LPS. Immunization with smooth organisms induced little or no antibody to heterologous LPSs. Soluble LPS, outer membrane vesicles, and whole bacteria produced strong homologous inhibition but little or no heterologous inhibition in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Cross-adsorption of antisera to rough mutants suggested that the IgG and IgM antibodies induced to heterologous LPS were adsorbed by the heterologous LPS and not by the core LPS used to immunize the animals. Rabbit antibody directed to J5 or Re595 LPS fails to bind to any substantial degree to heterologous LPS. Immunization with whole bacterial vaccines, particularly the rough mutants and lipid A, does increase antibody to a wide variety of antigens. The possibilities that the protective effects of antisera to rough mutants are due to a polyclonal antibody response or to the induction of as yet unidentified factor(s) deserve further investigation.
TI  - An avidin-biotin based ELISA for quantitation of antibody to bacterial polysaccharides.
AB  - A solid phase immunoassay utilizing avidin-biotin binding has been developed for  measuring anticapsular polysaccharide antibodies. Capsular polysaccharides of Escherichia coli K1, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Staphylococcus aureus types 5 and 8, and levan from Aerobacter levanicum have been biotinylated through -OH or COOH groups with retention of antigenicity. Polysaccharides were immobilized on avidin-coated microtiter wells for use in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect antibody. Two preparations of biotinylated S. aureus type 8 polysaccharide were equivalent as antigens in ELISA. Specificity was demonstrated by absorption of antisera, by competitive inhibition with purified antigens, and by reaction with specific monoclonal or myeloma antibodies. Reproducibility of the assay for H. influenzae type b and S. aureus type 8 antibody was demonstrated by replicate titrations of high and low level antisera.
TI  - Cloning and surface expression in Escherichia coli of a structural gene encoding  a surface protein of Haemophilus influenzae type b.
AB  - Recombinant DNA technology was used to clone a gene coding for a surface protein  of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) into Escherichia coli. Chromosomal DNA from a clinical isolate of Hib was cleaved with EcoRI and ligated into plasmid vectors containing three different translational reading frames. E. coli carrying recombinant plasmids were screened in a colony blot-radioimmunoassay system by using murine monoclonal antibodies (mabs) directed against cell surface-exposed proteins of Hib. mab 7B2, which is specific for a Hib surface protein with an apparent molecular weight of 27,000 (27K), reacted with several recombinant strains of E. coli. Restriction analysis revealed the presence of a 9.1-kilobase DNA insert in each of these recombinant plasmids and also determined that both transcription and translation of the Hib gene(s) coding for the 7B2-reactive antigen were not dependent on the lac operator and promoter of the vectors. Radioimmunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses showed that the antigenic determinant recognized by mab 7B2 in these recombinant E. coli was present in a 27K protein. In addition, this 27K protein was shown to be both localized on the surface of these E. coli cells and accessible to antibody.
TI  - Isoelectric focusing of human antibody to the Haemophilus influenzae b capsular polysaccharide: restricted and identical spectrotypes in adults.
AB  - Serum antibody to the capsular polysaccharide of Haemophilus influenzae b of human adults was analyzed by isoelectric focusing. Restricted antibody spectrotype patterns were commonly observed with as few as one spectrotype in some subjects after immunization with the isolated capsular polysaccharide. Some patterns were as restricted as human hybridoma antibody. There was no correlation of antibody titer and heterogeneity of patterns. The dominant spectrotype persisted unchanged for over 2 yr after immunization, and the pattern detected in preimmunization serum samples persisted unchanged after immunization. Indistinguishable patterns were commonly observed in genetically unrelated adults. Adults immunized with conjugate vaccines, which were composed of oligosaccharides prepared from the capsular polysaccharide that were covalently linked to protein carriers, also produced restricted serum antibody spectrotype patterns. Immunization with the cross-reactive polysaccharide of E. coli K100 induced a spectrotype pattern that was restricted but different from that induced by the H. influenzae b capsular polysaccharide.
TI  - [Immunostimulating activity of combined antigens of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus, Proteus and Escherichia coli and separate components in cross infection].
AB  - Experiments on mice have revealed that the combined preparation of K. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus, Proteus and E. coli antigens possesses pronounced immunostimulating activity against the microorganisms whose antigens make up this combined preparation, as well as against Haemophilus influenzae, type b. Cross protection between the antigens making up the preparation was observed, as well as of each of its components with respect to H. influenzae, type b. The activity of the combined antigenic preparation has been shown to exceed that of its monocomponents, as manifested under the conditions of cross infection. These experimental data may serve as a prerequisite for the development of an immunostimulant for the treatment of patients with chronic pyoinflammatory diseases.
TI  - Ceftriaxone: a beta-lactamase-stable, broad-spectrum cephalosporin with an extended half-life.
AB  - Ceftriaxone is an aminothiazolyl-oxyimino cephalosporin. It possesses the typical in vitro activity of a third-generation cephalosporin with excellent activity against many gram-negative aerobic bacilli: Escherichia coli; species of Proteus, Klebsiella, Morganella, Providencia and Citrobacter; and Enterobacter agglomerans. Ceftriaxone also has outstanding bactericidal action against pneumococci, group B streptococci, meningococci, gonococci and Hemophilus influenzae. In healthy volunteers, it has an exceptionally long serum half-life of 5.8-8.7 (mean 6.5) hours. It distributes well throughout all body spaces, including cerebrospinal fluid in the presence of inflammation. Dosage modification is necessary only when there is combined hepatic and renal dysfunction. Adverse reactions characteristic of cephalosporins have been observed with the administration of ceftriaxone. No unique toxicities have been identified, and hypoprothrombinemic bleeding is not part of the adverse reaction profile. Ceftriaxone has been used to treat serious bacterial infections in neonates, infants, children and adults. Bacteriologic and clinical success rates have consistently exceeded 90%. The drug has also been used as single-dose chemoprophylaxis in coronary artery bypass, biliary tract, vaginal hysterectomy and prostatic surgery. Efficacy and safety were similar to multiple-dose cefazolin. Ceftriaxone warrants special consideration because its extended half-life allows for less frequent dosing than other antimicrobials. Significant cost savings can be realized with proper use of this antibiotic.
TI  - Bacterial infection in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome of children.
AB  - We have followed 46 children with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related complex. Twenty-six patients had at least one episode of serious bacterial infection. Twenty-seven episodes of sepsis were documented in 21 patients. Soft tissue infection was common in both the presence and the absence of documented bacteremia. Urinary tract infection commonly presented as worsening diarrhea in the absence of sepsis. Organisms commonly isolated included Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Salmonella sp. Staphylococcal infection accompanied episodes of cellulitis/abscess. Escherichia coli commonly caused urinary tract infection in the absence of sepsis. Enteric and nosocomial sepsis was limited to hospitalized, instrumented patients or to individuals who had received prior antibiotic therapy as outpatients. We conclude that bacterial infection causes serious morbidity in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related complex and may be further evidence for altered humoral immunity in the disorder.
TI  - Alteration of the cell wall of Haemophilus influenzae type b by transformation with cloned DNA: association with attenuated virulence.
AB  - A virulent strain of Haemophilus influenzae type b was used to construct a lambda library of chromosomal DNA in Charon 4, amplified in Escherichia coli. From this library a recombinant (I-69) phage was isolated that contained a 10.2-kilobase-pair fragment of DNA eliciting H. influenzae transformants whose colonies had a distinctive opaque phenotype. Compared with their H. influenzae parent strains the opaque I-69 transformants had two defined cell wall alterations: one in the lipopolysaccharide (greater mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and one in the outer membrane proteins. The I-69 transformant of virulent type b strain Rd-/b+ had stable expression of type b capsule. In contrast to strain Rd-/b+, the Rd-/b+/I-69 transformant was serum sensitive in vitro and avirulent in vivo in rats. Thus the potential of H. influenzae type b organisms to cause invasive infection can be substantially attenuated by altering the expression of one or more genes that affect the cell wall composition.
TI  - Role of cephalosporins in the treatment of bacterial meningitis in adults. Overview with special emphasis on ceftazidime.
AB  - Experience with the use of first-generation cephalosporins in bacterial meningitis has been disappointing; low concentrations were obtained in the cerebrospinal fluid, and therapeutic failures were encountered. Of the second-generation cephalosporins cefamandole, cefuroxime, and cefoxitin, only cefuroxime has proved efficacy in meningitis caused by meningococci, pneumococci, or Hemophilus influenzae. The third-generation cephalosporins offer new advantages in the treatment of meningitis because they are active at the cerebrospinal fluid concentrations obtainable. Cefotaxime has produced high cure rates in patients with meningitis caused by meningococci, pneumococci, or H. influenzae. Several controlled comparative studies indicate that ceftriaxone is as effective as conventional treatment in therapy for neonatal or childhood meningitis caused by Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, or H. influenzae. Moxalactam has been found in uncontrolled studies to be effective when the cause was enteric gram-negative bacilli. Ceftazidime is a new cephalosporin with a high degree of beta-lactamase stability and a broad antibacterial spectrum, which includes Pseudomonas aeruginosa that enters the cerebrospinal fluid. Data from 29 patients who received ceftazidime as monotherapy for bacterial meningitis showed an overall cure or improvement rate of 75.9 percent. Therapy failed in three patients with meningitis caused by gram-positive organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. agalactiae), and in three with gram-negative organisms. Of 14 patients with Pseudomonas meningitis, 11 showed a cure, as did six of six patients with meningitis caused by Enterobacter, Serratia, or Acinetobacter. More, preferably controlled, studies of the efficacy of ceftazidime in the treatment of meningitis should be undertaken.
TI  - Therapy for lower respiratory tract infections with imipenem/cilastatin: a review of worldwide experience.
AB  - The worldwide experience with imipenem/cilastatin as of November 7, 1983, in the  intravenous therapy for severe and moderately severe infections of the lower respiratory tract is reviewed. Of 204 assessable patients treated in 77 studies conducted by 70 investigative groups (43 in the United States, 27 in other countries), 173 (85%) were cured of their infections or showed improvement. Imipenem was tested against 289 of 303 bacterial pathogens isolated before therapy, and 284 (98%) were found to be susceptible. Principal pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. A total of 76% of infecting pathogens were eradicated during therapy. Of 54 imipenem-susceptible infecting strains of P. aeruginosa, however, 57% were eradicated, 19% acquired resistance to imipenem, and 17% were replaced by new resistant strains of P. aeruginosa. Higher doses of imipenem/cilastatin and/or combined therapy with an aminoglycoside may improve these results. Imipenem/cilastatin compares well with the most active agents available for therapy for lower respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Recovery of blood-borne bacteria from human urine.
AB  - Recovery from the urine of organisms causing bacteraemia may depend on the bacterial species involved. The survival of the more common species of bacteria which cause bacteraemia was examined in human urine, serum and normal saline. All species survived well or grew in serum. Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus sanguis and group A streptococci were killed in all urine samples. The number of colony-forming units of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and group B streptococci either remained the same or increased in the urine, while the numbers of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae increased rapidly. These data suggest that the observed differences in recovery from urine of these bacterial species that cause bacteraemia are related to the viability of the species in human urine.
TI  - Pneumonia treated with imipenem/cilastatin.
AB  - In an open, prospective, multicenter trial the efficacy and tolerance of imipenem/cilastatin for the treatment of bacterial pneumonia was investigated. Forty-three adults were studied: 29 with nosocomial and 14 with community-acquired infections. Significant underlying disease was present in 91 percent of patients. Nosocomial infection was frequently associated with endotracheal intubation (48 percent), prior antibiotic therapy (48 percent), and recent surgery (31 percent). Most frequent sputum isolates included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10, all nosocomial), Hemophilus influenzae (10), Escherichia coli (eight), Staphylococcus aureus (seven), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (six). Treatment with imipenem/cilastatin was associated with clinical cure in 93 percent of patients. Two of three failures and one superinfection occurred in association with isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to imipenem. Overall, six of 10 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated prior to therapy developed resistance to imipenem after an average of 10 days of therapy. Adverse effects occurred in nine patients (21 percent) and included one case of pseudomembranous colitis. Monotherapy with imipenem/cilastatin of serious lower respiratory tract infections was relatively safe and highly effective with the exception of disease associated with P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Treatment of purulent meningitis in the child using Cefotaxime].
AB  - Cefotaxime has a good meningeal diffusion and is effective at low concentrations  on many bacteria, especially ampicillin resistant Enterobacteriaceae and Hemophilus influenzae. We have therefore used cefotaxime (150 mg/kg/24 h, continuous infusions lasting 30 minutes q. 6 h.) in meningitis due to gram negative bacilli. Twenty eight infants and children have been treated within 4 years. The 13 Hemophilus influenzae meningitis (including 2 beta-lactamase producers) have been cured without immediate sequelae. The duration of treatment could be reduced from 3 weeks to 2 weeks. The 7 infants with Enterobacteria meningitis (6 E. coli and 1 Serratia) have been cured of their infection with a 21 to 28 days treatment. The C.S.F. was sterile 2-3 days after treatment except a case of E. coli persisting during 7 days in C.S.F. contrasting with a normal ventricular fluid. A case of relapse with E. coli remaining sensitive was cured with a new course of the same treatment. Five meningitis complicated with hydrocephalus needed external drainage: the fluid was sterile 1 day after treatment in 4 of them. Two superinfections of ventriculo-peritoneal shunt due to Enterobacteriaceae have been cured. To obtain a good result, the need for a careful drug monitoring must be emphasized.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of Sch 34343, imipenem, cefpirome and cefotaxime.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of Sch 34343 was compared with that of imipenem, cefpirome  and cefotaxime against clinical isolates of important bacterial pathogens. Sch 34343 was very stable to changes in media, human serum concentration, pH and inoculum size. Enterobacteriaceae, including strains resistant to aminopenicillins and established cephalosporins, were susceptible to Sch 34343. In the case of Acinetobacter spp., imipenem was the only highly active antibiotic. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (and most other Pseudomonas spp.) were insensitive to Sch 34343. Activity against Haemophilus influenzae was greater than that of imipenem but less than that of cefotaxime and cefpirome. Sch 34343 activity against Gram-negative anaerobic rods was greater than that of cefoxitin and comparable to imipenem. All methicillin-sensitive staphylococci were inhibited by 1 mg/l of Sch 34343, 0.5 mg/l of imipenem, 2 mg/l of cefpirome and 8 mg/l of cefotaxime. Activity of all four against methicillin-resistant staphylococci was low. Streptococcus faecalis was inhibited by 16 mg/l of Sch 34343 and 2 mg/l of imipenem. The activity of Sch 34343 was not affected by a beta-lactamase inactivating third generation cephalosporins.
TI  - Sch 34343: in-vitro antibacterial activity and susceptibility to beta-lactamases.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of the penem Sch 34343 was assessed in comparison with third-generation cephalosporins, aztreonam and imipenem. Sch 34343 was active, with MICs generally 2 mg/1 or less, against a broad spectrum of organisms amongst which were staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), streptococci (though enterococci were less susceptible with Sch 34343 MICs mostly 4-8 mg/1), anaerobes (including the Bacteroides fragilis group), Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It was also active against the Enterobacteriaceae though Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia spp. were somewhat less susceptible than other members of this group. Sch 34343 lacked useful activity against most species of Pseudomonas (including Ps. aeruginosa) but was active against Ps. acidovorans and some isolates of Ps. cepacia. Sch 34343 showed a high degree of resistance to plasmid-determined and most chromosomally-determined beta-lactamases; however, it was hydrolysed rapidly by enzymes from some isolates of Aeromonas hydrophila and more slowly by enzymes from Ps. maltophilia and Bact. melaninogenicus subspecies intermedius. We did not observe any reduction in sensitivity to Sch 34343 for most beta-lactamase-producing organisms, including strains of Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii that were resistant to most other beta-lactams.
TI  - [Serum levels and sputum levels of cefmenoxime in respiratory tract infections].
AB  - In 11 patients with respiratory tract infections, the concentrations of cefmenoxime (CMX) in serum and sputum after 1 hour intravenous administration of 2 g of CMX were investigated. The peak serum level of CMX was 102.2 +/- 11.4 micrograms/ml after 1 hour drip infusion, then declined and was 3.51 +/- 0.55 micrograms/ml after 5 hours. Sputum level of CMX was lower than serum level but it was able to cover enough for MIC of Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae and the peak sputum level of CMX was 0.77 +/- 0.17 micrograms/g after from 2 hours to 4 hours. Among the 11 patients with respiratory tract infections, 2 patients showed excellent, 6 patients good, 3 patients poor results (isolated organisms of sputum were normal flora) and no side effects observed.
TI  - Deposition of C3b and iC3b onto particulate activators of the human complement system. Quantitation with monoclonal antibodies to human C3.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies were used to determine the number and molecular form of C3  bound to particulate activators of the complement (C) system by human serum. Sheep erythrocytes (E) coated with IgM (EIgM) and IgG (EIgG) were used to study activation of the classical pathway (CP). Yeast (Y), rabbit erythrocytes (ER), and five species of bacteria (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Hemophilus influenzae type b) were used to study activation of the alternative pathway (AP). The deposition of C3b onto EIgM and EIgG incubated in C7-deficient human serum was dependent on the serum concentration. At all serum concentrations tested, there was complete conversion of C3b to iC3b. Kinetic analysis of C3b deposition and conversion to iC3b indicated that these events occurred almost simultaneously; the reaction was completed by 15 min. The deposition of C3 onto the AP activators ER and Y was also dependent on serum concentration, and ER, but not Y, required the presence of Mg-EGTA and thus the activation of only the AP. C3b deposition and conversion to iC3b on Y was complete in 15 min, with 82% of bound C3 converted to iC3b. For ER, maximum C3 deposition required 30 min in both the presence and absence of Mg-EGTA. However, after 1 h of incubation, 74% of bound C2 was iC3b in the absence of Mg-EGTA, compared with only 52% in the presence of Mg-EGTA. Thus, even on AP activators, a large portion of C3b may be converted to iC3b, and this conversion is probably controlled by elements on the particle's surface. Studies with the five species of bacteria yielded similar results. Approximately 3-5 X 10(4) molecules of C3 were bound per microorganism, with opsonization being completed in 30 min. Remarkably, only 16-28% of bound C3 was in the form of iC3b, even after 2 h of incubation. The presence or absence of Mg-EGTA, or the addition of purified CR1 to the reaction mixture, did not significantly effect the ratio of C3b to iC3b. Finally, SDS-PAGE and autoradiography of particle-bound 125I-C3 fragments confirmed that there was no conversion of iC3b to C3d,g or C3d. The data obtained about the opsonization of bacteria suggest that the predominant form of C3 that is encountered by inflammatory phagocytes may be C3b.
TI  - Early detection of bacteremia in an outpatient clinic.
AB  - A total of 570 patients, aged less than 24 months, who were seen in the emergency room at Texas Children's Hospital for evaluation of acute febrile illness had a WBC count, differential count, and a blood culture obtained. Bacteremia occurred in 7.7% (n = 44) (22 Haemophilus influenzae; 17 Streptococcus pneumoniae; three Escherichia coli; one group B Streptococcus; one Staphylococcus aureus). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of morphologic changes (vacuolization and toxic granulation) of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (segmented neutrophils plus band cells), WBC count greater than or equal to 15,000/microL and band cells greater than or equal to 500/microL were examined. Additionally, abnormalities in three of four tests (WBC count greater than or equal to 15,000/microL, band cells greater than or equal to 500/microL, segmented neutrophils greater than or equal to 10,000/microL, and/or total polymorphonuclear neutrophils greater than or equal to 10,500/microL) were evaluated. Morphologic changes of polymorphonuclear neutrophils were noted frequently in patients with culture-proven bacteremia (63% and 51% positive predictive value for vacuolization and toxic granulation, respectively) and were more predictive of bacterial infection than traditional tests. If both vacuolization and toxic granulation were present, the positive predictive value increased to 76%. Examination of the peripheral blood smear may provide important adjunctive information for the presence of bacteremia prior to bacteriologic confirmation.
TI  - [Cefminox concentration in tissues and clinical efficacy of cefminox in acute peritonitis].
AB  - Cefminox sodium (CMNX, MT-141), a new semisynthetic cephamycin, having marked resistance to beta-lactamase, and a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacterial species, including Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter freundii, CMNX has higher activity in vivo than in vitro. For therapeutic purpose, CMNX was given in a daily dose of 0.5 g (0.5 g X 1) to 2 g (1 X 2) by intravenous drip infusion for 4 to 8 days to 24 cases with acute peritonitis (17 cases with acute appendicitis, 1 with localized peritonitis after gastrectomy, 1 with diffuse peritonitis due to perforative duodenal ulcer and 5 with panperitonitis due to intestinal obstruction). The clinical response was rated excellent in 9 cases, good in 14 cases and fair in 1 case and poor in none. No adverse effect was observed. There were 29 strains isolated organisms included 12 Escherichia coli, some Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These isolated organisms were eradicated after CMNX treatment, except a strain of E. faecalis was decreased. In 19 cases of them, 16 cases with acute peritonitis due to acute appendicitis and 3 cases with acute panperitonitis due to intestinal obstruction, CMNX was administered intravenously in a dose of 1 g (1 case was 0.5 g) before or during the operation, and tissue specimens and body fluids samples were taken during the operation. CMNX concentration was determined to a bioassay with Escherichia coli NIHJ or Vibrio vercolans ATCC 8461 as the test organisms. CMNX concentrations in purulent ascites were 47.2 +/- 38.5 micrograms/ml (n = 23), those in infected appendix wall were 32.2 +/- 21.7 micrograms/g (n = 16), that in pus in appendix were 22.1 +/- 24.3 micrograms/ml (n = 8) and that in other non infected tissues were 24.3 +/- 22.0 micrograms/g (n = 8). CMNX concentrations in infected tissues were higher than the non infected tissues. In the 3 cases with empyemic appendicitis, CMNX levels in pus in appendix were more higher than that in appendix wall itself. Therefore, CMNX sodium appears to be a very useful drug when used for chemotherapy on acute peritonitis.
TI  - [Comparison of the growth curves of Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae subjected to ampicillin and amoxicillin].
AB  - Results of conventional techniques indicate that most non-beta-lactamase producing Haemophilus influenzae strains are "susceptible" to ampicillin and amoxicillin. A previous study of growth curves established using the MS-2 system has demonstrated a faster bacteriolytic activity on Escherichia coli of amoxicillin as compared to ampicillin. A similar study on Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 9795 showed a) significant residual growth subsequent to contact of cultures with antibiotics in concentrations approximating minimal inhibitory concentrations; b) persistent residual growth for all concentrations from 1 to 500 micrograms/ml, with little concentration-dependency. Concentrations of amoxicillin needed to achieve identical inhibition of Haemophilus growth curves were twice those of ampicillin.
TI  - Comparison of a new, rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with latex particle  agglutination for the detection of Haemophilus influenzae type b infections.
AB  - A new, rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of polyribosylribitol phosphate of Haemophilus influenzae type b was compared with a commercially available latex particle agglutination (LPA) system (Bactigen; Wampole Laboratories, Cranbury, N.J.). By adding specimens and the anti-polyribosylribitol phosphate immunoglobulin-enzyme conjugate to the solid phase in a single step, it was possible to complete the ELISA procedure in 30 min. The ELISA was capable of detecting 0.3 ng of polyribosylribitol phosphate per ml in cerebrospinal fluid, 0.6 ng/ml in urine, and 1.2 ng/ml in serum; the in vitro sensitivity of LPA in these body fluids was 0.6, 0.3, and 0.3 ng/ml, respectively. Both procedures detected polyribosylribitol phosphate in specimens from 25 patients with bacteriologically confirmed H. influenzae type b infections. The specificity of ELISA appeared to be superior to that of LPA. ELISA was positive in only one of seven patients who had a positive LPA test and a clinical illness that was not compatible with haemophilus infection. Moreover, five patients with bacteriologically confirmed infections due to other pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae type 14 [two patients], Neisseria meningitidis group C, Escherichia coli K100, and Staphylococcus aureus) had false-positive LPA tests; only two (E. coli and S. aureus) were positive by ELISA. A total of 108 samples from 61 patients who had no evidence of haemophilus infections were negative by both procedures. The ELISA is a rapid, sensitive, and specific alternative to LPA for the detection of haemophilus polyribosylribitol phosphate.
TI  - Aztreonam therapy in experimental meningitis due to Haemophilus influenzae type b and Escherichia coli K1.
AB  - The penetration of aztreonam into cerebrospinal fluid was 7 to 15% and 9 to 25%,  respectively, in experimental Haemophilus influenzae type b and Escherichia coli K1 meningitis. Aztreonam was effective in reducing the number of organisms in cerebrospinal fluid after single-dose and continuous infusion administration, and the median bactericidal titers in cerebrospinal fluid were 1:32 against both meningeal pathogens.
TI  - In vitro studies on the antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. The compound was highly active against the common members of the Enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. YM-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, and Providencia stuartii. The activity of YM-13115 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. Against Haemophilus influenzae YM-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. YM-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The concentrations of YM-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78 and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit Streptococcus faecalis. YM-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. YM-13115 is extremely active against P. aeruginosa and members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of DN-9550, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - DN-9550 [(6R, 7R)-7-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(1H-imidazol-4-yl) methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(1-pyridinio)methyl]-8-oxo-5-thia -1-azabicyclo methyl]-8-oxo-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylate hydrochloride] is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The activity of DN-9550 against most species of the family Enterobacteriaceae was roughly comparable to that of ceftazidime, slightly lower than that of cefotaxime, and far exceeded that of cefoperazone. Against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia marcescens, DN-9550 was more active than ceftazidime and cefotaxime. DN-9550 and ceftazidime were significantly more active than cefotaxime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but DN-9550 and cefotaxime were clearly more active than ceftazidime against staphylococci and streptococci. Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were also highly susceptible to DN-9550, but Bacteroides fragilis was generally not susceptible to the compound. DN-9550 was stable to various types of beta-lactamases and had high affinities for penicillin-binding protein 3 of both Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa. When DN-9550 was administered subcutaneously to mice experimentally infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, its efficacy well reflected its in vitro potency.
TI  - Binding of polymyxin B nonapeptide to gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The binding of the outer membrane-disorganizing peptide polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN) to gram-negative bacteria was studied by using tritium-labeled PMBN. Smooth Salmonella typhimurium had a binding capacity of ca. 6 nmol of PMBN per mg (dry weight) of bacteria, which corresponds to ca. 1 X 10(6) to 2 X 10(6) molecules of PMBN per single cell. The binding was of relatively high affinity (Kd, 1.3 microM). The isolated outer membrane of S. typhimurium bound ca. 100 nmol of PMBN per mg of outer membrane protein (Kd, 1.1 microM), whereas the cytoplasmic membrane bound 9 to 10 times less. Other bacteria which are susceptible to the action of PMBN (Escherichia coli strains, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae) also bound large amounts of PMBN. The S. typhimurium pmrA mutant, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Proteus mirabilis (all known as resistant to polymyxin and PMBN) bound 3.3, 4, and 12 times less than S. typhimurium, respectively. The binding of PMBN to S. typhimurium was effectively inhibited by low concentrations of polymyxin B, compound EM49 (octapeptin), polylysine, and protamine. Spermine, Ca2+, and Mg2+ also inhibited the PMBN binding although they were ca. 160, 700, and 2,400 times less active (based on molarity) than polymyxin B, respectively. No binding inhibition was found at the tested concentrations of streptomycin, tetralysine, spermidine, or cadaverine.
TI  - [Therapeutic effects of cefminox in the treatment of various infections of infants and children].
AB  - The therapeutic effects of cefminox (CMNX, MT-141), a new synthetic cephalosporin antibiotic, were examined in the treatment of various pediatric infections. Patients treated were infants and children ranging from 12 days after birth to 12 years old suffering from bronchopneumonia in 10 cases, urinary tract infection in 6 cases, pharyngitis in 2 cases, cervical lymphadenitis in 2 cases, suppurative meningitis, cervical abscess, mastoiditis, peritonitis, bronchitis in 1 case each, total of 25 cases. As regards method of administration, CMNX from a vial was dissolved in physiological saline or distilled water for injection, and the solution was administered by 3 to 5 minutes one shot intravenous injection (15 cases), or CMNX was diluted with large volume parenteral product and administered by 30 to 60 minutes drip infusion (10 cases). The dosage of the drug was 21.3 to 165.5 mg/kg/day. The administration was continued for 3 to 13 days except 1 case. As regards clinical efficacy, good or excellent results were obtained in all cases except 3 cases, 1 case was urinary tract infection with cerebral palsy and vesicoureteral reflux, and 1 case was bronchopneumonia with Down syndrome and endocardial cushion defect, the other was suppurative meningitis. Total effective rate was 88%. No clinical side effects nor abnormal laboratory findings obviously attributable to CMNX were observed.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on cefminox in the pediatric field].
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies were performed as follows on cefminox (CMNX, MT-141), a new cephamycin antibiotic. Pharmacokinetics Serum concentrations of CMNX were measured in 4 patients given CMNX for prophylactic purpose during cardiac catheterization. In 2 patients given 20 mg/kg of CMNX by intravenous bolus injection, the average of peak serum concentration was 178.9 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes. The mean urinary recoveries in these 2 cases was 66.9% within 6 hours after injection. In 2 patients given 20 mg/kg of this drug by 1 hour drip infusion, the peak serum concentration was obtained at the time drip was completed, and the average value was 68.3 micrograms/ml. Clinical efficacy CMNX was administrated intravenously to 13 patients in dose of 52.9 approximately 96.0 mg/kg t.i.d. or q.i.d. for 4 approximately 7 days; 3 with tonsillitis, 6 with bronchitis, 1 with bronchopneumonia, 1 with UTI, 1 with lymphadenitis and 1 with enterocolitis. The overall efficacy rate was 92.3%, i.e., efficacy was excellent in 12, and poor in 1. Bacteriological efficacy was excellent, i.e., 3 of 3 strains disappeared. Side effects were observed in 3 cases, i.e., 1 case of eruption, 1 case of diarrhea and 1 case of transient eosinophilia. The above results suggest that CMNX is a useful antibiotic for treating pediatric bacterial infections.
TI  - [Clinical studies on cefminox in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - A new antibiotic of cephamycin group, cefminox (CMNX, MT-141), was evaluated clinically in the treatment of bacterial infections in children. The following results were obtained. One case of lacunar tonsillitis (due to H. influenzae) and 5 cases of urinary tract infections (due to E. coli in 2 cases, mixed infection due to E. coli and E. faecalis in 1 case, due to K. pneumoniae in 1 case and causative organism was unknown in 1 case) were treated intravenously with CMNX at daily doses ranging from 58.1 to 122.7 mg/kg in 3 divided doses. One case in which the treatment was discontinued after 1 day because of rashes was excluded from assessment of efficacy. Among the remaining 5 cases, CMNX was found ineffective for 1 case of mixed infection due to E. coli and E. faecalis. However, in all of the other 4 cases excellent results were obtained. As side effects, rashes developed in 1 case and slight elevation in GOT in 1 case out of 6 cases. Blood levels following bolus intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg of CMNX were 68, 45, 27, 10.2 and 3.1 micrograms/ml at 1/2, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours, respectively, with T 1/2 of 1.27 hours. The urinary recovery rate within the first 6 hours was 78.6%.
TI  - Bacteraemia at the University Hospital of the West Indies--a report of 222 cases.
AB  - A total of 222 cases of septicaemia was recorded at the University Hospital of the West Indies between June 1982 and June 1983. This gave an overall incidence of 16.1 per 1000 admissions. The 233 bacterial strains isolated comprised 100 Gram-positive and 133 Gram-negative organisms with Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus being the most frequent. Highest rates of septicaemia were recorded in patients less than 1 year and over 50 years of age. Septicaemia caused by Gram-positive organisms was predominantly a disease of children whereas that caused by Gram-negative organisms arose more often in neonates and in patients over 50 years of age. A predisposing factor was noted in 104 patients of whom 42 had neoplastic disease. The most frequently identified initial sites of infection were the respiratory tract, the gastro-intestinal tract and the meninges. Most blood stream infections were community-acquired, three quarters of all septicaemic patients being admitted to the departments of medicine or paediatrics. There were 11 cases of polymicrobial septicaemia caused predominantly by Gram-negative organisms in patients with underlying disease. Appropriate antimicrobial drugs were administered to 57% of septicaemic patients whereas 17% received superfluous antimicrobial therapy. In those patients who received inappropriate antimicrobial therapy there was a marked increase in mortality. Forty of 61 deaths were attributed to septicaemia. Mortality from septicaemia caused by Gram-negative organisms was 21% compared with 13% for that caused by Gram-positive organisms. The organisms associated with the highest case fatality rates were Escherichia coli, 53%; Enterobacter sp., 27%; and beta-haemolytic streptococci 24%. There were no deaths from septicaemia caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Salmonella sp. or Serratia sp. The highest mortality rates were associated with neoplastic disease, diabetes, polymicrobial septicaemia, urinary tract infections and old age.
TI  - The pharmacokinetics and serum and urine bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin is an investigational quinolone agent possessing an impressive antibacterial spectrum. Its pharmacokinetics were studied in six volunteers after 250-mg and 500-mg single oral doses, and its bactericidal activity compared to that of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole given to the same volunteers. Mean peak serum levels were 1.45 micrograms/mL and 2.46 micrograms/mL for 250-mg and 500-mg doses, and time to peak was 1 and 1.3 hours. The 12-hour levels were 0.12 micrograms and 0.22 microgram. Half-life (T1/2)alpha were 0.32 and 0.43 with T1/2 beta were 3.97 and 4.15 and volume of distribution (area) were 80L and 90L, respectively. Area under the concentration curve (AUC) was 5.65 h X micrograms/mL and 10.37h X micrograms/mL. Serum clearance was 23L for both doses. Approximately 49% of the 250-mg dose and 43% of the 500-mg dose was recovered in the urine. Bactericidal levels were determined against clinical isolates. Sera at 1.5 hours after the 500-mg dose averaged bactericidal levels of 1:20 or better for an Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and beta-lactamase producing Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis. Urinary bactericidal levels at eight to 12 hours were greater than or equal to 1:157 for E coli, K pneumoniae, gentamicin-piperacillin resistant P aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and 1:20 for Streptococcus faecalis. Serum bactericidal levels were superior, and urine bactericidal levels were superior or equal to the bactericidal levels obtained with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Treatment of gram-negative infections with aztreonam.
AB  - Twenty-one patients with serious gram-negative infections were treated with aztreonam. Twenty of these were clinical and microbiologic cures; there was one clinical improvement with microbiologic persistence. No bacteria became resistant. Cure rates were: bone and joint (11 of 11); skin and soft tissue (six of six); pneumonia (two of two); perinephric abscess (one of one); and intra-abdominal abscess (zero of one). The bacteria responsible for these infections included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12), Serratia marcescens (two), Enterobacter gergoviae (three), Enterobacter aerogenes (two), Escherichia coli (one), Citrobacter diversus (one), and Hemophilus influenzae (one). Aztreonam was well tolerated. Significant serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase/serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase elevations developed in three patients, but none was symptomatic and all resolved after therapy was stopped. Two patients in whom a rash developed were receiving other antibiotics (vancomycin and metronidazole), making the cause of the rash unclear. Diarrhea developed in a single patient with Pseudomonas osteomyelitis, who also was receiving cefazolin for Staphylococcus aureus superinfection of his decubitus ulcer. Aztreonam was highly effective against gram-negative bacilli, including P. aeruginosa. The only clear-cut side effect was an asymptomatic rise in serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase/serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase levels in three patients.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - [Experimental and clinical evaluation of the BRL 25000 (clavulanic acid-amoxicillin) granules in the pediatric field].
AB  - BRL 25000 granules containing 2 parts amoxicillin and 1 part potassium clavulanate were administered to children suffering from acute infections at a daily dose of 50 mg/kg in 3 or 4 divided doses for at least 3 days. Infections included acute airway infections (81), scarlet fever and suspected scarlet fever (4), urinary tract infections (4), impetigo contagiosa (1) and acute colitis (1). Bacteria were eradicated in 91.3% (63/69) of cases treated with the BRL 25000 granules, with only 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 of Escherichia coli, 1 of Haemophilus influenzae and 1 of Streptococcus pneumoniae remaining. Eight beta-lactamase producing strains were detected amongst the 49 clinical isolates studied and of these, 6 were eradicated after administration of the BRL 25000 granules. Good clinical efficacy was obtained in 97.8% of cases (89/91), with 1 case of acute tonsillitis and 1 of acute colitis showing no improvement. Adverse reactions were limited to 1 case of vomiting and 3 of diarrhea, and no abnormal laboratory findings were detected.
TI  - Dynamics of resistance to cephalosporins.
AB  - Bacterial susceptibility to various cephalosporins of nine of the most frequently isolated organisms were analyzed for the five-year period 1980 to 1984. The disk diffusion susceptibility to cephalosporins of 1,640,031 strains of bacteria isolated from 242 hospitals in the United States were compared. No significant change has occurred in the susceptibility of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, or Streptococcus faecalis for this period; Enterobacter aerogenes showed a slight decrease in susceptibility to moxalactam, cephalothin, cefoxitin and cefamandole. Slight increases in susceptibility were observed with Pseudomonas aeruginosa to cefotaxime and moxalactam and for Bacteroides fragilis to cefoxitin and cefamandole. Staphylococcus aureus showed slight decreases in susceptibility to cefoperazone and ceftizoxime and slight increase to moxalactam.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of Ro 17-2301, a new monobactam, compared with other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The susceptibility of 554 recent clinical isolates and known resistant bacterial  strains to the new monocyclic beta-lactam Ro 17-2301 were studied and compared to that to other beta-lactams (including aztreonam and temocillin) and gentamicin. Ro 17-2301 had a high degree of activity against the Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l) being similar or slightly more active than aztreonam and ceftazidime. Strains of Acinetobacter spp. (MIC90 16 mg/l). Haemophilus influenzae strains (including beta-lactamase producers) were more susceptible (MIC90 0.5 mg/l) than those of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC90 4 mg/l); against these latter two groups of isolates aztreonam was more active (MIC90 0.12 mg/l). Both aztreonam and Ro 17-2301 had little activity against Gram-positive cocci with the exception of Streptococcus pneumoniae for which the MIC90 of RO 17-2301 was 16 mg/l. Ro 17-2301 had modest activity against Bacteroides fragilis. The MBC of Ro 17-2301 was very similar to the MIC and the addition of human serum had little effect on the amount of the compound. The mean serum protein binding was 26.3%. A study of the penicillin binding protein affinity of Ro 17-2301 in a strain of Escherichia coli showed PBP 3 to be the primary target. The morphological response to exposure to Ro 17-2301 was filamentation followed by lysis after prolonged exposure.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of the effect of cefotaxime in senile pneumonia caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - 66 patients with predominantly community-acquired pneumonia were treated with cefotaxime. The group consisted of 45 males and 21 females, aged 56 to 90 years, 43 of the patients belonging to the age groups 65-80 years. Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated in 21 of the 34 patients with gram-positive pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus in six, Staphylococcus epidermidis in five and Streptococcus faecalis in two. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the predominant pathogen in gram-negative pneumonia (eight patients), followed by Enterobacter (n = 6), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 5), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 4), Escherichia coli (n = 3), Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter (two cases each). The in vitro activity of cefotaxime against the isolates was compared to the activity of other beta-lactam antibiotics. Characteristically, the classical signs and symptoms of pneumonia were absent or discrete in some of the elderly patients. There was a delayed clearance of pulmonary infiltrates. 55 of 66 patients responded to cefotaxime within four weeks of treatment; the symptoms were aggravated or remained unchanged in seven patients. Patients with a delayed clinical response displayed decreased peripheral lymphocyte counts and T cell functions in PHA stimulation tests, as well as low immunoglobulin levels. A combination of cefotaxime and gamma-venin cleared the symptoms in some of these patients.
TI  - Ceftriaxone administered once or twice a day for treatment of bacterial infections of childhood.
AB  - Twenty-six children received a single daily intravenous dose of ceftriaxone, 50 mg/kg, for a variety of bacterial infections including abscess (5), cellulitis (5), periorbital cellulitis (5), bacteremia without focus (4), osteomyelitis (2), pneumonia (2), pyelonephritis (2) and otitis media (1). Organisms isolated from infectious foci were Staphylococcus aureus (9), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), Streptococcus pyogenes (3), Escherichia coli (2); and Haemophilus influenzae type b, nontypable H. influenzae, Group B streptococcus, Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and satelliting streptococcus (1 each). Microbiologic cure was achieved in 20 of 22 (91%) infections and clinical cure in 25 of 26 (96%). Fifteen possible adverse reactions occurred in 34 patients evaluable for drug safety; most were mild and self-limited. Neutropenia developed in two patients necessitating discontinuation of ceftriaxone in one, followed by prompt resolution. Seventeen children received ceftriaxone, 75 mg/kg/day, in two divided doses for a similar variety of infections. Bacteriologic and clinical cure rates of 100 and 94%, respectively, were demonstrated. Leukopenia developed in one patient and resolved when ceftriaxone was discontinued. Once a day dosing of ceftriaxone in pediatric patients provides greater ease of administration combined with efficacy equal to that achieved with a divided dosage schedule.
TI  - Detection of beta-lactamase activity with nitrocefin of multiple strains of various microbial genera.
AB  - The production or presence of beta-lactamase(s) was studied by the rapid method utilizing the chromogenic cephalosporin compound nitrocefin in cultures of multiple strains belonging to the same genus as well as groups of microorganisms. The genera were: Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, rare Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. With this sensitive and rapid assay for beta-lactamase, it was possible to verify and separate the beta-lactamase producing cultures from the non-producers and include the useful strains to on-going research, such as beta-lactam screen, beta-lactamase inhibitory study and lytic properties of beta-lactams. The data also provide evidence for the possible role of beta-lactamase(s) in the physiology, biochemistry and pathogenicity of bacterial strains. The nitrocefin method was found a very specific and extremely useful procedure for the detection and estimation of beta-lactamase activity.
TI  - [Lack of specificity of protected distal bronchial samples in the bacteriological diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia caused by gram negative bacilli].
AB  - Lower respiratory tract secretions (LRS) were sampled during a two year period in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation using a method previously described by Matthew et al. Only those LRS positive for gram-negative bacilli were reported in this study. The patients were separated in two groups: those with nosocomial pneumonia due to gram-negative bacilli (NP+ group) and those without (NP- group). The species most often isolated from LRS were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (25%), Proteus (20%), Escherichia coli (18%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10%), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (8%) and Haemophilus influenzae (7%). The spectrum of gram-negative species was not statistically different in either group of patients. The numbers of gram-negative bacilli isolated from each LRS were more important in the NP+ group (p less than 0.001), but so was the duration of mechanical ventilation before each LRS (p less than 0.01). In this group also, a specific bacteriological diagnosis with only one species was possible in 3 out of the 13 cases; a tentative diagnosis only was possible in 10 cases: in 6 cases, the responsibility of two (or more) species was suggested. The susceptibility to antibiotics of gram-negative bacilli isolated from LRS was moderate. A third generation cephalosporin together with amikacin seemed to be the best choice of antibiotics when no specific bacteriological diagnosis could be made with the LRS.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cefmenoxime against clinical isolates. Comparative study].
AB  - Antibacterial activity of cefmenoxime (CMX) against clinically isolated organisms was examined in comparison with that of 4 other antibiotics and concluded as follows: Antibacterial activity of CMX was markedly stronger than those of cefazolin (CEZ), cefmetazole, latamoxef and ampicillin against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, H. influenzae, P. mirabilis and indole positive Proteus. But the MIC level of CMX against S. aureus was higher than that of CEZ.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of norfloxacin and other agents against ocular pathogens.
AB  - 302 clinical isolates representing 16 bacterial species most often implicated in  ocular infections were tested in vitro against norfloxacin and a panel of antibacterial agents. On the basis of the 90% minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC90) data, norfloxacin was 4-32 times more active than the next best antimicrobial tested against Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with overall MIC90 less than or equal to 1 mg/l. Norfloxacin was equal in activity to polymyxin B against Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC90 = 1 mg/l), and it ranked second to both polymyxin B against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and cotrimoxazole against Staphylococcus aureus, (MIC90 = 2 mg/l in each case). Along with neomycin and cotrimoxazole, norfloxacin (MIC90 = 1 mg/l) ranked second to gentamicin and tetracycline against Moraxella species. Compared to erythromycin (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l), norfloxacin (MIC90 less than or equal to 16 mg/l) was considerably less active against streptococci. Overall, norfloxacin was the most active agent in both potency and antibacterial spectrum against the test organisms. These results suggest the potential use of norfloxacin in the treatment of superficial bacterial infections of the eye.
TI  - In-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to enoxacin, norfloxacin, gentamicin and new beta-lactams.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of pefloxacin was compared with that of norfloxacin, enoxacin, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and, where appropriate, other beta-lactams against a total of 363 recent clinical isolates. An agar dilution procedure was used to determine MICs and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. Pefloxacin inhibited 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Shigella sonnei, Salmonella typhi, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae at less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l. Serratia marcescens and Providencia stuartii were somewhat more resistant, 2 mg/l of pefloxacin being required to inhibit 90% of isolates of these species. Pefloxacin inhibited 90% of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 4 mg/l and 90% of isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group at 16 mg/l. The activity of enoxacin was similar to that of pefloxacin, with enoxacin being four-fold less active against Staph. aureus, two-fold less active against the Bacteroides fragilis group and most species of the Enterobacteriaceae, and two-fold more active against Ps. aeruginosa. Pefloxacin showed good activity against gentamicin-resistant Ps. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae and against methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus. Strains with decreased susceptibility to norfloxacin tended to be less susceptible to both pefloxacin and enoxacin.
TI  - Bordetella adenylate cyclase: host toxicity and diagnostic utility.
AB  - Two toxins from Bordetella pertussis, pertussis toxin and Bordetella adenylate cyclase, cause profound disruptions of cAMP metabolism in mammalian cells. While the role of each toxin in the whooping cough syndrome is unknown, it is highly likely that together they confer on the organism an important proliferative advantage. Intact B. pertussis cells express large amounts of adenylate cyclase activity on their exterior surface. In a presently unknown fashion, this enzyme can enter human phagocytes, elevate cellular cAMP and impair host defense. We reasoned that this unusual enzyme might serve to signal the presence of B. pertussis in nasopharyngeal swabs from infected persons. Here we report a series of in vitro experiments which confirm the feasibility of such an approach. We find that calcium alginate swabs containing as few as 100 B. pertussis organisms produce readily detectable amounts of cAMP in our assay. Nasopharyngeal secretions swabbed from healthy volunteers, however produced no detectable cAMP alone and did not affect the production of cAMP by B. pertussis. We have also tested pure cultures of four common bacterial pathogens (Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli) which may be co-isolated in clinical whooping cough and find that none interferes with the detection of B. pertussis. We conclude that the unique adenylate cyclase of B. pertussis might be a valuable diagnostic device.
TI  - Purification and characterization of Haemophilus influenzae pili, and their structural and serological relatedness to Escherichia coli P and mannose-sensitive pili.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae pili were purified, and their physical and serological properties were examined. The solution properties of the pili were determined, and then a purification scheme involving repeated cycles of precipitation and solubilization was developed. The purified pili from one type b isolate (A02) were found to consist of multiple copies of a 25,000 mol wt subunit. Amino-terminal sequence analysis of A02 pili was carried out to 40 amino acid residues, and a remarkable degree of sequence homology was found with E. coli P and mannose-sensitive (MS) pili (27.5 and 25% homology, respectively). Purified A02 pili were found to be highly immunogenic, and serological analysis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and whole piliated cell agglutination revealed significant cross-reactivity between A02 pilus antiserum and the pili of seven other H. influenzae strains tested (heterologous titers = 2-100% of the homologous titer). Cross-reactivity was also observed between the H. influenzae pili (five of eight strains tested) and the P pili from E. coli strains HU849 and 3669; no cross-reactivity was detected with MS pili from E. coli strain H10407 and C94. The structural similarities between H. influenzae and E. coli P and MS pili suggest a common gene ancestry.
TI  - Cefmenoxime: clinical evaluation.
AB  - Cefmenoxime was evaluated in an open trial consisting of 41 patients. Forty infections in 36 patients could be evaluated. Thirteen patients had pyelonephritis due to Escherichia coli (two bacteremic), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Streptococcus faecalis; all improved and 12 of 13 were clinically cured, but one relapse (S. faecalis) occurred at two weeks. Six patients with cystitis due to E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, P. aeruginosa, or S. faecalis all improved, but relapse or reinfection, or both, occurred in five due to P. aeruginosa, S. faecalis, C. fruendii, or E. coli. Neurogenic bladder or other complications were present in five of 13 patients with pyelonephritis and five of six with cystitis. Ten patients with pneumonia and one with tracheobronchitis due to Hemophilus influenzae, S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, or Neisseria meningitidis all improved and seven had resolution without relapse, but P. aeruginosa emerged in two patients, one of whom died. Eight soft tissue infections due to Staphylococcus aureus, Peptococcus prevotti, Streptococcus species, or infections of mixed origin resolved in six. Sterility of blood cultures was obtained in one patient with endocarditis due to S. anginosus, but other therapy was substituted. Clinical resolution of the toxic shock syndrome and subsequent negative endocervical cultures for S. aureus occurred in one. Granulocytopenia of unverified cause in four (with less than 1,500 mm3) and two (with less than 2,000 mm3) was reversible. Headache during treatment occurred in six patients and a possible disulfiram-like effect in three. Elevations of serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase and alkaline phosphatase occurred in five, Coombs' positivity in two, and diarrhea in three. Clinical efficacy of cefmenoxime was significant. Possible side effects require further study.
TI  - Cefmenoxime efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics in critical care patients with nosocomial pneumonia.
AB  - Nephrotoxicity frequently complicates the use of aminoglycosides in severely compromised acute care patients. Therefore, an open clinical trial was initiated to determine if cefmenoxime alone is useful in serious nosocomial pneumonias. Thirty consecutive patients were entered in the trial, and 28 patients with an average age of 66 years were evaluable. Most were malnourished at entry, with serum albumin averaging 2.8 g/dl and prognostic nutritional index values over 70 percent (normal less than 40 percent). One-half the patients had severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 68 percent required ventilators. Fifty-seven percent had concomitant cardiac disease, and 79 percent had previously been treated with antibiotics. Pneumonia was proven to be present by new infiltrate on chest x-ray, new fever, elevated white blood cell count, and gram-negative rods on gram stain and in cultures of tracheal aspirates or sputum. Patients were given cefmenoxime 1 to 2 g every six hours an average of 12 days. Cefmenoxime peak (one hour) and trough concentrations were measured by high pressure liquid chromatography and averaged 58 and 7 micrograms ml, respectively. Pharmacokinetic data in 18 patients were determined from serum profiles. Gram-positive organisms, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and Hemophilus influenzae were usually eradicated. Persistence was noted for some Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, Serratia, and Acinetobacter. Persistence in patients with good clinical response was considered colonization rather than superinfection. Overall, a satisfactory clinical response rate was noted in 78.6 percent of evaluable patients, whereas four patients responded satisfactorily with recurrence and two treatments had an unsatisfactory response. No serious adverse effects were observed. Cefmenoxime is a promising agent in the treatment of susceptible pneumonias in critical care patients.
TI  - In vitro activity of CGP 31523A, a broad-spectrum cephalosporin, in comparison with those of other agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CGP 31523A, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was compared with those of cefoxitin, cefuroxime, moxalactam, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, and other beta-lactams, when appropriate, against 533 recent clinical isolates and known resistant strains of bacteria. The MICs of CGP 31523A required to inhibit 90% (MIC90S) of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. Of Staphylococcus aureus (excluding methicillin-resistant strains) and Haemophilus influenzae, 90% were susceptible to 0.5 micrograms/ml. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Lancefield group D streptococci were resistant to CGP 31523A (MIC90, greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml). The activity against Bacteroides fragilis was modest (MIC90, 32 micrograms/ml). The susceptibility of known beta-lactamase-producing strains suggested that CGP 31523A was resistant to many beta-lactamases (but not those of Bacteroides fragilis). The serum protein binding of CGP 31523A was about 73%. The primary target site of CGP 31523A in Escherichia coli appeared to be penicillin-binding protein 3.
TI  - Conjugally-acquired antibiotic resistance: are plasmids always present?
AB  
TI  - [Value of cefotaxime in gram-negative bacterial meningitis. Apropos of 3 developmental forms in neonates and infants].
AB  - Three cases of meningitis with E. coli and H. influenzae are reported. They illustrate the recrudescence and relapse in bacterial meningitis. After the failure of initial antibiotic therapy, the treatment by Cefotaxime allowed a good outcome in all the cases. On account of the bacteriological, pharmacological and clinical data the authors advise using Cefotaxime in first purpose in meningitis with common gram negative bacilli.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in Johannesburg--1980-1982.
AB  - A 2-year retrospective study of aetiology, age distribution, seasonal variation and antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of bacteria isolated from patients with meningitis in five Johannesburg hospitals for White, Black, Coloured and Asian patients was performed. Neisseria meningitidis was isolated most frequently, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus group B. In the Black population 73% of the meningococcal infections occurred in patients over 3 years of age, and the majority of these infections were caused by serogroup A organisms. Virtually all (93%) of the H. influenzae infections occurred in children of less than 3 years of age. Of the isolates tested, 16% of the meningococci, 4,5% of the H. influenzae and 47% of the pneumococci were resistant to sulphadiazine, ampicillin and penicillin respectively.
TI  - The use of penicillins in orthopaedic surgery.
AB  - The main use of the penicillins in orthopedic surgery is in the treatment of infections due to Hemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Group D streptococci (enterococci). Penicillins have antimicrobial activity and have a characteristic pharmacodynamic action, including side effects. The tissue penetration characteristics of the penicillins into synovial fluid and human bone are significant. Semisynthetic penicillins, antistaphylococcal penicillins, and the antipseudomonal penicillins are used for treatment of septic arthritis and osteomyelitis. Oral penicillin therapy can be useful in treatment of osteomyelitis.
TI  - Effectiveness of cefotaxime in gram-negative meningitis.
AB  - We treated 12 adult patients who had gram-negative bacillary meningitis with cefotaxime administered intravenously at a dose of 2 g every 4 hours. The etiological organisms included Haemophilus influenzae (3 cases), Serratia marcescens (3 cases), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3 cases), Escherichia coli (2 cases), and Enterobacter (1 case). The infection followed a neurosurgical procedure in 6 cases. The mean inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of cefotaxime for the isolates ranged from 0.125 to 0.25 microgram/ml. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of cefotaxime ranged from 5.0 to 15.2 micrograms/ml, and the CSF bactericidal titers were 1:64 to 1:128. The CSF in all patients was sterilized within 96 hours. All 12 patients recovered, and there were no relapses.
TI  - Rationale for clinical trials evaluating ceftriaxone in the therapy of bacterial  meningitis.
AB  - Ceftriaxone is a promising antimicrobial agent in the therapy of bacterial meningitis. The rationale for the clinical evaluation of ceftriaxone in patients with meningitis is based on the following favorable characteristics: ceftriaxone has excellent in vitro activity (MBC90 0.25 microgram/ml or less) against the major meningeal pathogens including meningococci, pneumococci, group B streptococci, Hemophilus influenzae, and Escherichia coli, but it is inactive against Listeria monocytogenes; ceftriaxone is rapidly bactericidal within purulent cerebrospinal fluid in experimental animal models of meningitis induced by pneumococci, group B streptococci, H. influenzae, and E. coli; against most of the major meningeal pathogens, the activity attained in cerebrospinal fluid in human subjects with bacterial meningitis is high (1:512 or greater) and active concentrations of ceftriaxone persist in cerebrospinal fluid for prolonged periods compared with those of other cephalosporins; the results of clinical trials reported to date in patients with meningitis are encouraging. Ceftriaxone deserves further clinical evaluation in the treatment of bacterial meningitis; the optimal dose, frequency of administration, and duration of therapy remain to be determined.
TI  - Antimicrobial agent susceptibility patterns of bacteria in hospitals from 1971 to 1982.
AB  - Bacterial susceptibility to 16 commonly used antibiotics was analyzed for a 12-year period (from 1971 to 1982, inclusive). Susceptibilities of 5,828,243 strains isolated from a mean of 242 hospitals nationwide and of 194,575 strains isolated at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Mass., and the Bronx Lebanon Hospital Center, New York, N.Y., were compared. Strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed virtually the same susceptibilities to antibiotics throughout the 12-year period, whereas Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis showed significant increases in resistance to most antibiotics. The close similarity between antibiotic susceptibilities shown at both the 242 hospitals and the 2 individual hospitals suggests that this analysis accurately reflects trends of bacterial resistance to antibiotics in U.S. hospitals. Since most of the species analyzed produce serious disease and high mortality, their susceptibility to antibiotics is relevant both to physicians treating infectious diseases and to epidemiologists.
TI  - [MICs and MBCs of cefotaxime, desacetylcefotaxime and ceftriaxone against four principal bacteria causing meningitis].
AB  - The MICs and MBCs of cefotaxime (CTX), desacetylcefotaxime (Des-CTX) and ceftriaxone (CTRX) were determined in relation to 4 of the principal bacterial species which cause meningitis, i.e., S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, H. influenzae and E. coli. These tests were performed using final inocula of 10(8) cells/ml and 10(6) cells/ml. Comparison was made with the MIC and MBC values of benzylpenicillin (PCG) and ampicillin (ABPC). 1. Against 25 strains of S. pneumoniae, the MIC 90 values with inocula levels of 10(8) and 10(6) cells/ml were as follows: CTX, 0.05 and 0.024 micrograms/ml; Des-CTX, 0.39 and 0.20 micrograms/ml; CTRX, 0.10 and 0.05 micrograms/ml, respectively; and PCG, less than 0.012 micrograms/ml at both size. Similarly, the MBC 90 values were: CTX, 0.01 and 0.05 micrograms/ml; Des-CTX, 0.78 and 0.39 micrograms/ml; CTRX, 0.20 and 0.10 micrograms/ml; and PCG, 0.024 and 0.012 micrograms/ml, respectively. It is thus apparent that PCG showed the lowest values for both the MIC and MBC, followed by CTX, CTRX and then Des-CTX. Against 25 strains of S. agalactiae, the MIC 90 values with inocula of 10(8) and 10(6) cells/ml were as follows: CTX, 0.05 and 0.05 micrograms/ml; Des-CTX, 0.39 and 0.20 micrograms/ml; CTRX, 0.10 and 0.05 micrograms/ml; and PCG, 0.39 and 0.20 micrograms/ml, respectively. Similarly, the MBC 90 values of Des-CTX were 0.78 and 0.39 micrograms/ml, while the other 3 antibiotics showed the same values with both the 10(8) and 10(6) cells/ml inocula: 0.10 micrograms/ml for CTX, 0.20 micrograms/ml for CTRX and 0.39 micrograms/ml for PCG. Accordingly, CTX showed the lowest values, followed by CTRX and then PCG being about the same as Des-CTX. Against 25 strains of H. influenzae, the MIC 90 values with inocula levels of 10(8) and 10(6) cells/ml were as follows: CTX, 0.10 and 0.05 micrograms/ml; Des-CTX, 0.39 and 0.39 micrograms/ml; CTRX, 0.10 and 0.05 micrograms/ml; and ABPC, 50 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Similarly, the MBC 90 values were: CTX, 0.20 and 0.10 micrograms/ml; Des-CTX, 1.56 and 1.56 micrograms/ml; CTRX, 0.39 and 0.20 micrograms/ml; and ABPC, greater than 100 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. Accordingly, in terms of the MIC 90, CTX and CTRX showed the same values, but in terms of the MBC 90 CTX was superior. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Treatment of 160 cases of acute bacterial meningitis with cefotaxime.
AB  - One hundred and sixty cases of acute bacterial meningitis were treated with cefotaxime. Patients were between 9 days and 79 years old: 7 new borns, 37 infants, 43 children, 19 adolescents and 54 adults. Fifty-eight patients (36%) were in coma when admitted. Aetiology was determined in 110 patients (68.8%): Neisseria meningitidis in 42, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 36, Haemophilus influenzae in 16, Salmonella spp. in 7, Staphylococcus aureus in 2, Enterobacter spp. in 2 and Haemophilus parainfluenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella pneumoniae in one patient each. All isolates were sensitive to cefotaxime, with MIC's for 26 strains ranging from 0.01 to 0.50 mg/l. One hundred and fifty-six of the 160 patients were treated with cefotaxime alone and the four others with cefotaxime in association with an aminoglycoside in three and rifampicin in one. Cefotaxime was administered by intravenous infusion, in a daily dose 100 to 300 mg/kg. Duration of treatment ranged from 8 days to 6 weeks, with a mean of 15 days. One hundred and forty-nine patients (93.1%) were cured, two after a relapse. Three patients had sequelae. Most (88.5%) had sterile CSF within 72 h after starting treatment. Eleven patients (6.9%) died, eight within the first 48 h. The only side-effects observed were mild transient eosinophilia in some patients and rash and leukopenia in 2 each. The study demonstrates that cefotaxime is effective in the treatment of acute bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FR 17027, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FR 17027, a new orally absorbed cephalosporin ester, inhibited group A and B streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.1 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the inhibition concentration of amoxicillin and cefaclor, and was more active than cephalexin. It was less active (MIC, 25 micrograms/ml) against staphylococci than was cephalexin, and it did not inhibit Streptococcus faecalis or Listeria monocytogenes. FR 17027 inhibited beta-lactamase-producing isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis at less than 0.1 micrograms/ml and was more active than cefaclor or cephalexin against these bacteria. FR 17027 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Providencia stuartii, Providencia rettgeri, and Citrobacter diversus at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, including isolated resistant to amoxicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor, but it was less active than ceftizoxime. Some strains of Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter aerogenes were resistant (MIC, greater than 25 micrograms/ml). FR 17027 did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other Pseudomonas species, Acinetobacter species, or Bacteroides species. Activity was minimally affected by growth conditions. FR 17027 was not hydrolyzed by the common beta-lactamases present in many of the pathogens causing respiratory and urinary tract infections in outpatients.
TI  - Interaction of thermally aggregated human IgG with bacteria.
AB  - Ninety-three bacterial strains, representing 16 Gram-positive and Gram-negative species, were tested for quantitative binding of 125I-labelled monomeric and thermally aggregated human IgG. Aggregated IgG bound to all bacterial species studied, in contrast to monomeric IgG, which interacted only with S. aureus, group A, C and G streptococci, viz. bacteria possessing previously described IgG-Fc receptors. A positive correlation was observed between binding of monomeric IgG and the uptake of thermally aggregated IgG (r = 0.92). Monomeric IgG inhibited effectively the binding of monomeric IgG but only partially the uptake of aggregates. Absorption with bacteria revealed that only a fraction of aggregated IgG could interact with bacteria lacking specific IgG-Fc receptors. A human group G streptococcus strain (G-148), tested with increasing amounts of immunoglobulin, was capable of binding at least ten times as much aggregates as monomeric IgG, implying binding to separate binding sites. These data indicate that polymeric IgG produced by thermal aggregation of human polyclonal IgG can interact with bacterial surface components found in most pathogenic microorganisms. This interaction seems to be less specific than the binding to previously described IgG-Fc receptors.
TI  - Cefodizime, an aminothiazolylcephalosporin. I. In vitro activity.
AB  - Cefodizime possesses a broad antibacterial spectrum including staphylococci, streptococci and Enterobacteriaceae. Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae are also highly susceptible to cefodizime. Because of its beta-lactamase stability cefodizime is active against bacterial strains producing especially plasmid-coded enzymes. The MICs of cefodizime are slightly higher than those of cefotaxime, but with most Gram-negative bacteria they are lower than those of cefazolin, cefotiam and piperacillin. The in vitro activity of cefodizime is not dependent on inoculum size, or on the pH and composition of the test medium. Cefodizime did not induce in vitro resistance of Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli. Because of its binding properties to PBPs 1A/B and 3, cefodizime leads to filamentation of Gram-negative rods and, at only slightly higher concentrations, to bacteriolysis.
TI  - Third-generation cephalosporins: a critical evaluation.
AB  - Six third-generation cephalosporins--cefotaxime, moxalactam, cefoperazone, ceftizoxime, ceftriaxone, and cefmenoxime--are reviewed; covered are chemistry and structure-activity relationships, mechanism of action, spectra of activity, pharmacokinetics, clinical utility, adverse effects, and cost effectiveness. The third-generation cephalosporins have a similar mechanism of action to that of other beta-lactam antibiotics. None of the agents is particularly active against certain gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; the drugs are effective against gonococci, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. Several common gram-negative pathogens are susceptible to the third-generation cephalosporins, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus, and Morganella. About 50% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates are susceptible. Only moxalactam has good activity against Bacteriodes fragilis. The pharmacokinetic profiles of the six agents reveal some important differences. The half-life of ceftriaxone allows once-daily dosing in many patients; the half-lives of ceftizoxime and cefoperazone permit dosing every 8-12 hours. Cefoperazone and ceftriaxone are highly protein bound, but the clinical relevance of this is unknown. Generally, the agents penetrate most body tissues and fluids well. Moxalactam and cefotaxime and possibly ceftriaxone effectively penetrate into the cerebrospinal fluid well. The third-generation cephalosporins have become the accepted drugs of choice for the treatment of adult gram-negative bacillary meningitis; as more experience is gained, they are likely to become the drugs of first choice for neonatal (with ampicillin) and childhood (except for moxalactam) meningitis. Serious infections of Enterobacteriaceae can be treated with these agents, thereby avoiding use of the aminoglycosides. Moxalactam is comparable with combination therapy in treating intra-abdominal infections. Adverse effects associated with use of the third-generation cephalosporins are generally similar to those that occur with other beta-lactam antibiotics with the exception of coagulopathies and the disulfiram reaction seen with moxalactam and cefoperazone. Despite the relatively high cost of the third-generation cephalosporins, they are often cost effective because of their reduced dosing frequencies, broad spectra of activity, and effectiveness in serious infections for which more toxic antibiotics have been required in the past.
TI  - The effect of dilution during culture on detection of low concentrations of bacteria in blood.
AB  - The standard procedure for culturing blood is to inoculate 5 ml of blood into 50  ml of broth, resulting in a blood-broth ratio of 1:10. In infants, where only 0.5 to 1.0 ml of blood is available for culture, blood:broth ratios may be as dilute as 1:100. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a blood-broth ratio of 1:100 was as sensitive as a ratio of 1:10 for detecting low concentrations of bacteria in blood. Blood (0.5 ml) seeded with 2 to 30 organisms/ml of one of four common pediatric pathogens (Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Group B Streptococcus or Haemophilus influenzae type b) was inoculated into culture broth so as to provide blood-broth ratios of 1:10, 1:30 or 1:100. There were no differences in the ability to recover organisms or in the time-to-positivity of cultures with different blood-broth ratios. Cultures were positive in 24 of 40 (60%) bottles at a ratio of 1:10, 28 of 40 (70%) at 1:30 and 30 of 40 (75%) at 1:100. Common pediatric pathogens can be recovered without delay from volumes of blood as small as 0.5 ml cultured at blood-broth ratios up to 1:100.
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacteria isolated from lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1982)].
AB  - Two hundred seventy-six bacterial strains were isolated as possible causative pathogens mainly from sputum in 248 patients with lower respiratory tract infections at 12 medical institutions in various parts of Japan during the period from September 1982 to March 1983. Of these, 272 isolates including 28 Staphylococcus aureus strains, 38 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, 107 Haemophilus influenzae strains, 68 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 17 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 9 Escherichia coli strains and 5 strains of other species were tested in vitro for MICs of various antibiotics, and their drug sensitivity distributions determined. Data were also analyzed for distribution of cases by clinical entities, age and sex, interrelations between the types of infections and the species and frequency of isolation of organisms, and relations of the antimicrobial regimens at collection of clinical specimens to the species and frequency of isolation of the organisms. It engenders great interest that there was a significant increase in frequency of S. aureus isolation within 7 days after antibiotic therapy, compared to pretreatment isolation frequency, in the 1982 series. This seems to deserve further investigation in detail. The H. influenzae strains isolated with the highest frequency in 1981 and those in 1982 were examined as to susceptibility to several representative antibiotics, with interdrug comparisons: ABPC vs. SBPC, CTM vs. CMZ, and CMX vs. LMOX. The isolates demonstrated high degrees of susceptibility to these drugs and there was no conspicuous change in bacterial sensitivity to the drugs.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefodizime, a new cephalosporin antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefodizime (HR 221), a new  cephalosporin, were compared with those of other cephem antibiotics. HR 221 was highly active against Gram-negative bacteria. The compound inhibited growth of all tested Haemophilus influenzae strains at 0.10 microgram/ml and showed strong activity even against penicillin-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains, but it was less effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa than the other antibiotics tested. Against Gram-positive bacteria, HR 221 showed 100% inhibition of growth of Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.39 microgram/ml, and it was slightly less active against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90:12.5 micrograms/ml) than other antibiotics such as cefotaxime (CTX). The bactericidal activity of HR 221 against E. coli was dose-related and comparable to that of CTX, cefoperazone and latamoxef. The bactericidal activity of the compound at medium concentrations simulating human serum levels was higher than that of CTX and cefmetazole, and no cell regrowth was noted after beta-lactamase-induced inactivation of the compound. HR 221 was stable to most drug-inactivating enzyme preparations from various bacterial species.
TI  - Cefmenoxime in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonias in critical care patients.
AB  - Nephrotoxicity frequently complicates the use of aminoglycosides in severely compromised acute care patients. Therefore, we initiated an open clinical trial to determine if cefmenoxime alone is useful for serious Gram-negative pneumonias in this population. Thirty consecutive patients were studied. Average age was 66 years. Most were malnourished at entry, with serum albumin averaging 2.8 g/dl and prognostic nutritional index values over 70% (normal less than 40%). One-half of the patients had severe COPD and 67.9% were on ventilators. Fifty-seven per cent suffered concomitant cardiac disease, and 78.6% had been previously treated with antibiotics. Pneumonia was proven by new infiltrates on chest X-ray, new fever, elevated WBC count and Gram-negative rods on Gram's stain and in cultures of tracheal aspirate or sputum. Patients were given cefmenoxime 1-2 g every 6 h for an average of 12 days. Cefmenoxime peak (1 h) and trough concentrations were measured by HPLC and averaged 58 and 7 mg/l respectively. Gram-positive organisms, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Haemophilus influenzae were usually eradicated. Persistence was noted for Enterobacter, Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter spp. Persistence in patients with good clinical response was considered colonization rather than superinfection. Overall, satisfactory clinical response rate was noted in 78.6%, while four patients responded satisfactorily with recurrence, and two treatments were unsatisfactory. No serious adverse effects were observed. Cefmenoxime is a promising agent for treatment of susceptible pneumonias in critical care patients.
TI  - Interpretive criteria and tentative quality control limits for apalcillin disk susceptibility tests.
AB  - In vitro studies with 661 bacterial isolates were performed to establish interpretive criteria. In addition, a nine-laboratory study was performed to establish quality control limits for tests with 100-micrograms apalcillin disks and to confirm testing criteria for tests with 100-micrograms piperacillin disks. The two drugs were very similar, and nearly identical criteria were recommended for interpretation and for control of the two types of disks. Neither disk is recommended for testing Staphylococcus spp. or Haemophilus spp.; with other microorganisms, zone size limits of less than or equal to 13 mm (resistant) and greater than or equal to 18 mm (susceptible) are proposed for tests with 100-micrograms apalcillin disks.
TI  - Bacteremia in hospitalized black South African children. A one-year study emphasizing nosocomial bacteremia and bacteremia in severely malnourished children.
AB  - During a one-year period, 315 of 5,397 children admitted to the general pediatric wards of a hospital had bacteremia. The commonest causative organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella enteritidis, Hemophilus influenzae, and Escherichia coli. Most episodes of bacteremia were associated with gastroenteritis, pneumonia, or meningitis. Seventy-eight episodes occurred in children with severe protein-energy malnutrition, and 46 episodes were hospital acquired. The overall case fatality rate was 23.2%, being highest in children with severe malnutrition and in those with other underlying conditions. The high proportion of bacteremias due to S pneumoniae and S enteritidis possibly reflects infections occurring in a lower socioeconomic group living in a temperate climate in crowded conditions. The most appropriate antimicrobial therapy for children who have suspected bacteremia in association with gastroenteritis or severe malnutrition is a combination of ampicillin sodium and gentamicin sulfate.
TI  - Microbiological aspects of the 1980 national prevalence survey of infections in hospitals.
AB  - The records of the 1980 national prevalence survey of infection in hospitals were re-assessed from a microbiological point of view. Of 407 records of Escherichia coli, 71 per cent came from the urinary tract while the commonest source of Staphylococcus aureus was from skin infections. These yielded only 41 per cent of the 303 records. Proteus spp. were recorded 166 times, Pseudomonas spp. 115 times and Klebsiella spp. 101 times. These came mainly from the urinary tract but other sources were important. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the viruses were associated with community infections while E. coli, Proteus spp., Pseudomonas spp., Klebsiella spp., Str. faecalis and non-aureus staphylococci were associated with hospital-acquired infections. The prevalence of bacteraemia was re-assessed.
TI  - Current mechanisms of resistance to antimicrobial agents in microorganisms causing infection in the patient at risk for infection.
AB  - The mechanisms of resistance encountered in bacteria causing infection in the patient at risk for infection are diverse. Most resistance currently seen is the result of plasmid transfer rather than mutational events. However, extensive use of antimicrobial agents in the hospital has caused the selection of organisms resistant to many agents by virtue of chromosomally mediated mechanisms. Staphylococcus aureus resistant to beta-lactams due to altered penicillin-binding proteins has become a problem in certain patients such as narcotic addicts and chronic care facility patients exposed to many beta-lactam antibiotics. S. epidermidis has also proved to be a problem in patients with indwelling foreign devices, and altered penicillin-binding proteins also make these organisms resistant to available penicillins and cephalosporins. Streptococcus fecalis has become increasingly resistant to aminoglycosides, erythromycin, and tetracyclines due to plasmid-mediated enzymes. Hemophilus influenzae resistant to both penicillins and chloramphenicol by virtue of beta-lactamases and chloramphenicol transacetylase has been encountered. Beta-lactamase-mediated resistance of Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae to beta-lactam antibiotics has increased, and resistance of Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to aminoglycosides and penicillins is a widespread phenomenon. Mechanisms to reduce resistance will include not only careful attention to hygienic practices but also more appropriate use of antibiotics selecting the proper agent depending on the type of patient and environment in which the infection develops.
TI  - In vitro activity of fludalanine combined with pentizidone compared with those of other agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of fludalanine ( MK641 ) combined with pentizidone ( MK642  ) so as to give a fludalanine /D-cycloserine ratio of 1:1 was compared with the activities of ampicillin, ticarcillin, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, and trimethoprim against 452 recent isolates and known beta-lactam- and trimethoprim-resistant strains. In addition, the in vitro activity of fludalanine - pentizidone on four different media, including a defined medium ( DFN -2), was studied. The MIC of fludalanine - pentizidone against 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Providencia stuartii, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Staphylococcus aureus, and fecal streptococci was 4 micrograms or less per ml on DFN -2, and activity was somewhat reduced on the other media. Proteus spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (90% MIC, less than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml) and Bacteroides spp. (90% MIC, 16 micrograms/ml) were less susceptible. Generally, fludalanine - pentizidone was less active than ceftazidime and comparable in activity to cefuroxime. beta-Lactamase-producing and trimethoprim-resistant strains tended to be susceptible to fludalanine - pentidizone . In the absence of human serum, the MBC of fludalanine - pentizidone was similar to the MIC. In the presence of increasing concentrations of human serum, there tended to be a greater difference between the MIC and MBC.
TI  - Plasmid containing a DNA ligase gene from Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - A ligase gene from Haemophilus influenzae was cloned into the shuttle vector pDM2 . Although the plasmid did not affect X-ray sensitivity, it caused an increase in UV sensitivity of the wild-type but not excision-defective H. influenzae and a decrease in UV sensitivity of the rec-1 mutant.
TI  - Twice daily ceftriaxone therapy for serious bacterial infections in children.
AB  - The clinical efficacy and safety of ceftriaxone, a long half-life cephalosporin were evaluated in 48 children with a variety of serious bacterial infections. Clinical cure was achieved in 92% (44 of 48) of patients. Peak serum bactericidal titres for Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Str. pyogenes and Escherichia coli were greater than or equal to 1:1024. Mean peak and trough ceftriaxone levels were 173 and 42 mg/l, respectively. Mild and transient diarrhoea was observed in 10% of patients. Laboratory side effects encountered were eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and neutropenia in another 8%. Ceftriaxone is a useful antibiotic for common childhood infections. Its prolonged half-life allows twice daily administration which reduces problems related to intravenous therapy as well as the cost and personnel time.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dosage of cefmenoxime. Observation on the MICS and cefmenoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (CMX) was determined using agar dilution at  inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml against 333 clinical bacterial isolates. CMX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter aerogenes and Haemophilus influenzae and also Streptococcus Pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae with MIC values in the range of 0.024 to 3.13 micrograms/ml. Against Staphylococci and Serratia marcescens, CMX showed the antimicrobial activity with MIC90 6.25 micrograms/ml. However, CMX was not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter anitratus and exhibited no useful activity against Streptococcus faecalis. Reliability of CMX disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of the antimicrobial activity was also investigated, using 8 mm diameter disc (Showa) and 6 mm diameter disc (Wako), both of them containing 30 micrograms of CMX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, capable of utilizing CMX disc susceptibility test for the estimation of proper administrative dose of CMX. Using 6 mm diameter disc containing 30 micrograms CMX, FUCHS et al. have proposed the following tentative zone size break points: greater than or equal to 22 mm = MIC 8 micrograms/ml, susceptible; 15 to 21 mm = MIC 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (intermediate); and less than or equal to 14 mm = MIC greater than 32 micrograms/ml, resistant. In this investigation, the following zone size break points have preferred: greater than or equal to 25 mm = MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml (3+); 20 to 24 mm = MIC greater than 3 to 15 micrograms/ml (2+); 16 to 19 mm = MIC greater than 15 to 60 micrograms/ml (+) and less than or equal to 15 mm = MIC greater than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml (-). Based on CMX pharmacokinetic data currently available, MIC break points proposed, less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, would be useful for estimating the administrative dose of this antibiotic to obtain the effective blood level (e.g. the bacteriostatic activity in serum 1: greater than or equal to 8 for treatment of severe infection.
TI  - Evaluation of cefotaxime in bacterial infections.
AB  - Cefotaxime, a third generation cephalosporin antibiotic, was evaluated in 26 infants and children for the treatment of documented or suspected bacterial infections, including pneumonia (10 cases), soft tissue skin infection (13 cases), and urinary tract infection (3 cases). An average daily dose of 60 mg/kg in 3 to 4 divided doses was administered parenterally for an average of 7 days. In 14 of the cases, primary pathogens, including Haemophilus influenzae b (resistant to ampicillin), Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, were eradicated. Clinical recovery occurred in each case. Blood levels at different time intervals and biological half-life were similar to those reported for adults. Mild and transient side effects observed were elevation of SGOT in two cases, alkaline phosphatase in one, and eosinophilia in one case.
TI  - Significance of encapsulated Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bacteroides fragilis groups in mixed infections.
AB  - Organisms of the Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bacteroides fragilis groups are  often found mixed with facultatively anaerobic organisms in infections. The relative importance of these Bacteroides groups and facultative anaerobic pathogens in mixed infections was investigated in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. This was determined by observing the effect of antimicrobial therapy directed against one or both organisms present in the abscess. Clindamycin or metronidazole was used for treatment of infections caused by Bacteroides species, and either gentamicin, penicillin, ampicillin, or oxacillin was used for treatment of infections caused by facultative flora. In almost all instances the aerobic counterparts in the infection were more important than the unencapsulated Bacteroides species. On the other hand, encapsulated B. melaninogenicus group organisms were found to be more important in abscess formation than were group A streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus. Encapsulated B. fragilis group organisms were found to be more important than or as important as Escherichia coli and group D streptococci and less important than S. aureus, group A streptococci, and K. pneumoniae in induction of subcutaneous abscesses. This study demonstrates that encapsulated Bacteroides species are a factor that should be considered in the treatment of mixed infections with antibiotics.
TI  - In vitro and clinical evaluation of ceforanide.
AB  - Ceforanide, a new cephalosporin antibiotic with a long half-life (three hours), was evaluated for its antimicrobial activity, pharmacology, and clinical efficacy. Fifty-two patients with 56 infections due to susceptible organisms received ceforanide, 0.5 g, 1 g, or 2 g, intramuscularly or intravenously every 12 hours for four to 60 days (average: 14.1 days). The in vitro studies of our clinical isolates showed that 12.0 micrograms/ml or less of ceforanide inhibited all Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta hemolytic streptococci group A, B, F, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Hemophilus influenzae. After a 1 gram intramuscular dose, the mean peak serum concentration at one hour was 44.0 micrograms/ml, and at 12 hours was 3.8 micrograms/ml. After a 1 gram intravenous dose, the mean peak serum concentration was 65.0 micrograms/ml, and the mean trough serum concentration at 12 hours was 9.6 micrograms/ml. The infections treated included ten pneumonias, ten urinary tract infections, seven bacteremias, two osteomyelitis, and 35 skin-soft tissue infections. Of the 56 evaluable infections treated, 52 had a clinical cure with only four failures. Ceforanide was well tolerated, with no patients developing thrombophlebitis, or liver or renal abnormalities. Three patients developed abnormal Coombs' reactions and one had diarrhea.
TI  - In-vitro activity of enoxacin (CL-919), a new quinoline derivative, compared with that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of enoxacin (CI-919), a new synthetic quinoline derivative  was compared with that of three other quinolines ofloxacin, norfloxacin and nalidixic acid. In addition beta-lactams and gentamicin were also included when appropriate. The MICs of enoxacin for 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., Providencia stuartii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were less than 4 mg/l, for Haemophilus influenzae less than 0.25 mg/l and Neisseria gonorrhoeae less than 0.03 mg/l. Bacteroides fragilis and streptococci (including Streptococcus pneumoniae) were less susceptible, MIC90 16 mg/l. Against many of the common Enterobacteriaceae enoxacin displayed a similar degree of activity as gentamicin. Gentamicin-resistant strains of common bacterial pathogens were susceptible to enoxacin as were methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus. The protein binding of enoxacin (concentration 5 mg/l) was 18%.
TI  - Postsplenectomy pneumococcemia in a healthy vaccinated adult.
AB  
TI  - Uptake of heterologous DNA by Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - With the use of highly competent Haemophilus influenzae cells, it was possible to demonstrate the uptake of heterologous DNAs. However, these DNAs, as expected, were only 1% or less as effective when competing for uptake with Haemophilus DNA. Escherichia coli DNA was removed from solution by competent cells to the extent expected if all the E. coli DNA particles contained at least one uptake recognition signal. The data were consistent with a model in which there was one uptake signal per 20 X 10(6) to 30 X 10(6) daltons of E. coli DNA. Since H. influenzae DNA has many more recognition signals, approximately one per 2 X 10(6) daltons (Danner et al., Gene 77:311-318, 1980; K. Vogt and S. H. Goodgal, submitted for publication), it has been suggested that the slower rate of E. coli DNA binding and the so-called specificity of Haemophilus DNA binding are due to the number of recognition signals per molecule of DNA as well as the nature of the DNA receptor (Vogt and Goodgal, submitted for publication). The specificity of native H. influenzae DNA binding does not apply to the uptake of denatured DNA in the transforming system (low pH) for denatured DNA.
TI  - Quantitation of bacteria in cerebrospinal fluid and blood of children with meningitis and its diagnostic significance.
AB  - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from pediatric patients with meningitis were  examined for their concentration of microbes and the relationship of this count to the bacteremia levels, microscopy results, and polymorphonuclear leukocyte concentration. A total of 2,031 consecutive CSF specimens were analyzed, of which 63 (3.1%) were positive by culture from the same number of patients. We observed that 85% of the total CSF specimens positive for Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Neisseria meningitidis had counts in excess of 10(3) CFU/ml, with 56% of the specimens exceeding 10(5) CFU/ml. A correlation existed between the number of organisms present in the CSF and blood. For example, from a total of 22 patients who had counts of H. influenzae greater than 10(3) CFU/ml in the CSF, 16 or 73% had levels of bacteremia greater than 10(3) CFU/ml. It was also noted that the bacterial concentration had a profound effect on the sensitivity of microscopy. The percentage of positive results increased from 25% with less than or equal to 10(3) CFU/ml to 60% in the range of greater than 10(3) to 10(5) CFU/ml and to 97% at concentrations of greater than 10(5) CFU/ml. Furthermore, a significant correlation (P less than 0.01) was noted between the concentration of bacteria in the CSF and the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes observed on microscopy.
TI  - Treatment of bacterial meningitis with ceftizoxime.
AB  - Ceftizoxime was evaluated in the treatment of 18 patients (6 adults and 12 children) with bacterial meningitis. In seven patients Haemophilus influenzae was the causative agent, in three Neisseria meningitidis, in five Streptococcus pneumoniae, and in one each alpha-streptococcus and Escherichia coli; one case was culture negative. Ceftizoxime was administered intravenously in doses of 200 mg/kg per day. Clinical response was appropriate in all patients with a mean time of defervescence of 3.7 days, and sterile cerebrospinal fluid was obtained from all patients at 24 to 36 h after initiation of therapy. The mean concentration of ceftizoxime in 46 cerebrospinal fluid samples obtained during therapy was 8.53 micrograms/ml (range, less than 0.5 to 29.0 micrograms/ml). Ceftizoxime concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid samples were ten- to several hundredfold the bactericidal concentrations of the pathogens isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid. Ceftizoxime penetrates the meninges well during acute infection and appears to be an excellent candidate antibiotic in the treatment of bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Clavulanic acid in combination with ticarcillin: an in-vitro comparison with other beta-lactams.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of ticarcillin in combination with clavulanic acid was compared with that of ticarcillin alone, piperacillin, cefotaxime and, where appropriate, other beta-lactams against a total of 301 recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. An agar dilution procedure was used to determine MICs and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. MICs of the combination of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid were expressed as MICs of ticarcillin in the presence of 5 or 10 mg/l of clavulanic acid. Against most members of the Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii and Serratia marcescens), ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid was as active as or more active than piperacillin. Against Staphylococcus aureus. Haemophilus influenzae and the Bacteroides fragilis group the combination was considerably more active than piperacillin. Piperacillin was more active than the ticarcillin/clavulanic acid combination against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with a monoclonal antibody for detecting group  A meningococcal antigens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - Hybridomas were produced from spleen cells of BALB/c mice immunized with a membrane preparation from Neisseria meningitidis group A strain 4402 and S194/5.XXOBU.14 myeloma cells. The hybridomas were screened for secretion of antibodies suitable for an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) diagnostic for group A meningococcal meningitis. One hybridoma antibody, 3G7, was directed against the pilus protein. This antibody bound to all six lipopolysaccharide and protein group A meningococcal serotyping strains, as well as to meningococcal strains from serogroups C, W135, and Y, but not to a strain of Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae type b, or to two or more strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Salmonella typhi. The ELISA used on antibody, antigen, antibody-conjugate sandwich. Rabbit anti-meningococcal serum was the coating antibody for the antibody sandwich, cerebrospinal fluids contained the bacterial antigens, and 3G7-alkaline phosphatase conjugate was the detecting antibody. The monoclonal antibody conjugate ELISA system was able to detect group A meningococcal antigens in 21 of 25 cerebrospinal fluid specimens that were positive in an immune rabbit serum conjugate ELISA; cerebrospinal fluid samples from patients with Haemophilus meningitis served as the controls. Counterimmunoelectrophoresis detected meningococcal antigens in 16 of the same 25 cerebrospinal fluid samples.
TI  - Does the use of chloramphenicol in animals jeopardise the treatment of human infections?
AB  - It has been suggested that the therapeutic use of oral chloramphenicol in animals is liable to select resistance to antibiotics and that the resistance may jeopardise the treatment of infections in man. At present this risk appears minimal; resistance to chloramphenicol in animal bacteria may well be selected by the increasing use of semi-synthetic penicillins because of linkage between genes coding for production of beta-lactamase and resistance to chloramphenicol. Among salmonellae, the strains causing enteric fever have no animal reservoir and the few food poisoning incidents in man that require therapy can be treated with antibacterial agents such as trimethoprim. Chloramphenicol is not now the antibiotic of choice for any human infection except perhaps a few caused by Haemophilus influenzae. Resistance to antibiotics in 'human' cultures has largely been selected by the use of antibiotics in human medicine. Control of salmonellosis is essentially a public health, not a therapeutic problem.
TI  - Trends in the development of beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - In many ways it is ironic that the first description of a beta-lactamase occurred in 1940 with an enzyme isolated from Escherichia coli since in recent years there has been a major interest in Gram-negative species and the development of agents to overcome the hydrolytic action of beta-lactamases of Gram-negative species. There have been four distinctly different approaches to the development of new beta-lactam antibiotics. These have been the search for inhibitors of beta-lactamases and agents such as clavulanic acid and sulbactam are examples of compounds which by virtue of Kcat function act as suicide inhibitors and make old antibiotics new. There has been the modification of the penicillin and cephem nucleus to increase beta-lactamase stability or failing that to improve the ability of the compounds to pass through the cell wall and increase affinity for critical beta-lactam receptors, i.e. penicillin-binding proteins. There has been the development of carbapenem type of agents such as imipenem which would have broad activity including aerobic, anaerobic, Gram-positive and Gram-negative species. There has been the discovery of the monobactam agents of which aztreonam is an example of a compound with great beta-lactamase stability but with activity limited to Gram-negative aerobic species. Bacterial resistance has indeed been the major factor that has modified use of beta-lactams and influenced the development of the aforementioned types of drugs. The widespread presence of beta-lactamases in common pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacteroides fragilis has made it necessary to have beta-lactamase stable compounds for initial therapy of infection. It is possible to analyze structure-activity relations of beta-lactam compounds to determine changes which will be most advantageous in light of known and expected resistance patterns. But the increased realization in recent years of the importance of the pharmacokinetics of beta-lactam drugs has made it essential that the development of new compounds be based on an integration of microbiological and pharmacokinetic parameters. Interest in the prevention of resistant flora has also affected the development of new drugs since it is increasingly appreciated that alteration of intestinal flora contributes to selection of drug resistant microorganisms. Finally, new toxicities or adverse effects associated with the use of certain new agents has modified the development of certain compounds.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial properties of FK 027, a new orally active cephem antibiotic.
AB  - FK 027 was more active than cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin against stock strains of a wide variety of gram-negative bacteria, including such opportunistic pathogens as Citrobacter and Enterobacter species and Serratia marcescens. FK 027 was significantly more active than the three reference drugs against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, indole-positive and -negative Proteus species, Providencia species, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It was less active than cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin against staphylococci, but it was similar to cefaclor in its activity against streptococci. With few exceptions, FK 027 was active against strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis that were resistant to the reference agents. The bactericidal activity of FK 027 against various gram-negative bacteria, including Proteus species, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, and S. marcescens, was greater than that of cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin. The therapeutic activities of FK 027 in mice infected with gram-negative bacilli were far superior to the activities of cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin, but they were inferior to the activities of these reference drugs against infection with Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Capsular polysaccharide vaccines today.
AB  - Polysaccharide (PS) vaccines are a relatively new class of antibacterial vaccines that have special advantages but also special problems related to their character. Several of them have proven very effective in preventing bacteremic infections caused by encapsulated bacteria such as meningococci, pneumococci and Haemophilus influenzae type b. Protective activity shows excellent correlation with serum anti-PS. However, young children often respond poorly to PS antigens and this limits the use of these vaccines in childhood. Some PS are poor immunizing agents even in adults. The practical implications of these aspects for the use and development of PS vaccines are discussed.
TI  - The use of beta-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of septicaemia and endocarditis.
AB  - Despite the availability of numerous beta-lactam antibiotics, benzylpenicillin remains the most important beta-lactam antibiotic in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis. Penicillin alone and in combination with an aminoglycoside is effective in the treatment of endocarditis due to all streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus aprophilus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Listeria monocytogenes. Oral phenoxymethylpenicillin in combination with streptomycin is effective in treating endocarditis due to viridans streptococci. Ampicillin is effective in endocarditis due to Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, H. paraphrophilus, Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli. Oral amoxicillin with gentamicin has been used to treat enterococcal endocarditis. The penicillinase-resistant penicillins are effective in treating S. aureus endocarditis. Carbenicillin or ticarcillin in combination with tobramycin or gentamicin are used to treat endocarditis due to Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The use of piperacillin in combination with tobramycin against P. aeruginosa endocarditis has been associated with failure and increased resistance. The cephalosporins have been used to treat endocarditis caused by susceptible organisms. There have been few data on the efficacy of the newer cephalosporins in treating endocarditis. They have been used to treat septicaemia due to susceptible organisms with good results.
TI  - Antibacterial monoclonal antibodies and the dawn of a new era in the control of infection.
AB  - Literature reports concerned with monoclonal antibodies against bacteria, or their toxins, which are pathogens for man and animals were surveyed. These antibodies have important potential uses in human and veterinary pathology and medicine. They are likely to become key elements in a fast progression toward a more complete understanding and control of infectious diseases and of toxin poisoning. A new area of bacteriology relevant to sanitary engineering is also being advanced with the help of antibacterial monoclonal antibodies. This area involves bacteria that produce the biofuel methane, along with other molecules of nutritional value, through a process which brings about the recycling of organic wastes and thereby limits or controls microbial contamination of soil and water.
TI  - [Immunostimulation in an animal model using intestinal bacteria preparations].
AB  - The treatment of mice with an injection preparation consisting of killed R-tribes of non-pathogenous E. coli caused an increase in microbicidic activities in the animal's blood and effects a significant protection against consecutive infections with Salmonella typhimurium. The enhancement of the animal' resistance capacity appears to be non-specific, and connected with the activity of leucocytes. Oral application of preparations of intestinal bacteria led to increased resistance against consecutive infections with Salmonella typhimurium and Haemophilus influenzae. Three different oral vaccines have been used: Streptococcus faecalis and E. coli, a viable vaccine of non-pathogenous Streptococcus faecalis and a viable vaccine of E. coli. The enhancement of the resistance can be attributed to an induction of the chemotactic efficiency of the animal neutrophilic cells. The chemotactic response of these cells seems to be enhanced. The mode of action of both the other oral vaccines remains obscure.
TI  - Functional epidemiology of bacterial meningitis.
AB  - The epidemiological behaviour of bacterial meningitis is examined to find clues as to the determinants of the disease. Such an examination has shown that a very limited number of bacteria are able to cause the disease and has suggested some of the virulence characteristics thereof, most notably the presence of certain types of polysaccharide capsules, the predilection of the disease to the first years of life is partially explained by the gradual development of immunity, especially serum antibodies to the capsular polysaccharides. The varying proportion of asymptomatic carriers to those falling ill and the homogeneity of the bacteria in an epidemic speak for the existence of other, as yet unknown virulence factors.
TI  - Clinical experience with aztreonam in urinary and respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Twenty patients with severe infection, 10 of the urinary tract and the other 10 of the respiratory tract, were enrolled in a clinical trial of aztreonam, a new monobactam antimicrobial agent. For the urinary tract infections, the mean duration of treatment was 7 days, with doses ranging from 0.25 to 1.0 g aztreonam intravenously twice daily. Sustained clinical and microbiological cure was achieved in 9 of the 10 patients. In the group with respiratory infections, the mean duration of treatment was 9.3 days, patients receiving 1 g aztreonam intravenously 3-times daily. Initial clinical cure was achieved in 9 of the patients, the tenth showing an incomplete response. However, bacteriological recurrence, related to the persistent nature of the underlying disease, occurred in 6 of the 10 patients during the 1-month follow-up period. The only side-effects were mild, transient biochemical abnormalities which did not require drug withdrawal in any patient.
TI  - Multicenter clinical trials of cefoperazone in Japan.
AB  - The safety and clinical efficacy of cefoperazone were evaluated at 149 institutions in Japan. A total of 979 hospitalized patients were treated with cefoperazone alone for 1,059 infections. In the 984 infections evaluated, there was an overall satisfactory clinical response in 824 (83.7%). Cefoperazone was effective in 83.0% of the respiratory tract infections, 84.9% of urinary tract infections, and 89.6% of hepatobiliary tract infections. Clinical response was satisfactory in 90% or more of the cases in which Escherichia coli, Serratia sp, Haemophilus influenzae or Staphylococcus sp were isolated. Sixty percent to 90% of the infections with Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Proteus sp, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa responded satisfactorily to cefoperazone. Cefoperazone was effective in 76.2% of 260 evaluated cases that had failed to respond to prior treatment with other cephalosporins. The adverse reactions that occurred in 19 (1.9%) of the 979 patients included rash (1%), diarrhea (0.6%), and fever (0.4%). Cefoperazone appears to be extremely useful in the treatment of various infections in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Contribution of bacterial cell wall compounds to airway hyperreactivity.
AB  
TI  - Nucleotide sequence homology between the immunoglobulin A1 protease genes of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Isolated DNA fragments encoding the immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1) protease of Neisseria gonorrhoeae were used as hybridization probes to search for homologous sequences in whole cell DNA from Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae. Significant homology was detected. That the detected homology represented IgA1 protease-specific sequences was confirmed by the cloning of these sequences in Escherichia coli HB101 and demonstrating the expression of IgA1 protease by these transformed cells. Molecular probing of commensal Neisseria and Haemophilus species, which do not elaborate IgA1 protease activity, revealed that they were devoid of sequence homology with the cloned IgA1 protease gene DNA.
TI  - Efficacy of ceftizoxime administered twice daily in hospitalized patients with respiratory tract infections.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of ceftizoxime administered twice daily were evaluated in 215 hospitalized patients with documented lower respiratory tract infections. The majority of patients received 1 to 2 gm of ceftizoxime intramuscularly or intravenously every 12 hours; the mean dosage was 2 gm/day, and the mean duration of therapy was 8.9 days. Clinical cure was achieved in 204 (95%) of the 215 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. One hundred and thirty-eight patients were both clinically and bacteriologically evaluable. The clinical response rates, by organism, were: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100% (50/50); Haemophilus influenzae, 96% (25/26); gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, Pseudomonas sp, Klebsiella sp, Citrobacter sp, and Morganella morganii), 86% (32/37); and Staphylococcus aureus, 92% (12/13). In the other 77 patients with clinical symptoms, no pathogen was isolated or insufficient follow-up data were collected to assess bacteriologic response. Adverse reactions, which were infrequent, were similar to those reported in other US trials of the drug. The findings indicate that ceftizoxime, 1 to 2 gm BID, is effective and safe in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in hospitalized patients. This low-dose regimen can significantly reduce the cost of cephalosporin therapy.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of ceftriaxone.
AB  - Seventy-seven patients with acute bacterial infections were treated with ceftriaxone (1 gm administered intravenously every 12 hours). The 58 patients evaluable for efficacy had 60 infections, including 39 of the respiratory tract, 14 of the urinary tract, and seven of soft tissue. Five patients were bacteremic. The mean duration of ceftriaxone treatment was eight days for patients with respiratory and urinary tract infections and 13 days for patients with other types of infections. A satisfactory clinical response occurred in 56 (93%) of the infections. Eighty-four (94%) of the 89 pretherapy pathogens were bacteriologically eradicated. Included were all 19 isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, all 15 of Streptococcus pneumoniae, all 12 of Escherichia coli, 22 of the 23 isolates of other Enterobacteriaceae species, three of five isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and three of four isolates of Staphylococcus aureus. Two cases of superinfection (one with bacteremia) occurred with P aeruginosa. There were two cases each of reinfection and colonization with Streptococcus faecalis. One patient developed manifestations of culture-documented S pneumoniae meningitis eight hours after the first dose was administered. Peak and trough plasma levels of ceftriaxone were 142 and 64 micrograms/ml. Ceftriaxone achieved therapeutic levels in infected cerebrospinal fluid and in the abscess fluid of selected patients. Adverse effects, which were mild, included diarrhea in 4% of the patients and elevated transaminase levels in 10%.
TI  - Monoclonal antibodies against Neisseria meningitidis lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - A cell line producing monoclonal antibodies directed against a lipopolysaccharide component of Neisseria meningitidis group A has been established. These antibodies reacted with only one of three lipopolysaccharide serotyping strains of group A meningococci by coagglutination, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Western blotting techniques. A Western blot analysis showed that a NaOH digest of lipopolysaccharide was detectable by the serotype-specific antibody. The monoclonal antibodies cross-reacted with a group B meningococcal strain in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The immunoblotting analysis also showed that these antibodies reacted with the lipopolysaccharides of a group B meningococcus as well as Haemophilus influenzae type B, but not with the lipopolysaccharides of several strains of Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
TI  - Directional transport and integration of donor DNA in Haemophilus influenzae transformation.
AB  - DNA transport and integration in Haemophilus influenzae transformation was studied with a plasmid clone of homologous DNA (pCML6). Our results indicate that: (i) donor DNA enters specialized membranous extensions on the cell surface, which we have termed "transformasomes"; (ii) linear DNA undergoes degradation upon exiting transformasomes; and (iii) DNA without a free end remains within transformasomes and is not degraded. By comparing the fate of label from uniformly labeled versus middle-labeled DNA, it appears that donor DNA undergoes degradation from an end prior to recombining with the chromosome. Using donor DNA with covalently closed termini (hairpin ends) prevents efficient exit from transformasomes. When one hairpin is removed, exit of donor DNA is shown to be directional from the free end, with preferential homologous integration of the 3' strand from that end.
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacteria isolated from lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1981)].
AB  - During the period from September 1981 to March 1982, 363 bacterial isolates were  obtained as possible pathogens from 311 patients with lower respiratory tract infections at 12 medical institutions in Japan. Of these clinical isolates, mostly from the sputum, a total of 231 isolates including 19 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 33 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 90 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 65 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 17 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and 7 strains of Escherichia coli were tested in vitro for minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 17 antimicrobial agents, and their antimicrobial susceptibility distribution and cumulative percentages of inhibited isolates by increasing concentrations of drugs were determined. The data were further analyzed to investigate the interrelation between such parameters as the age-distribution of patients by diseases of the respiratory system, sex and types of infection and the species and frequency of isolation of the organisms, and also the relationship between the antimicrobial chemotherapy prior to collection of clinical specimens and the species and incidence of the bacterial isolates. In respiratory infections, it is frequently that chemotherapy should be instituted with an appropriate drug even before the causative organism can be identified and assessed for its antimicrobial susceptibility. The present data may provide valuable informations in selecting appropriate drugs in practical, clinical use.
TI  - Evaluation of aztreonam in experimental bacterial meningitis and cerebritis.
AB  - Aztreonam (SQ 26,776), a new monocyclic beta-lactam agent, was compared with ampicillin, ampicillin plus chloramphenicol, and gentamicin in rabbits with experimental meningitis induced by, respectively, ampicillin-susceptible Haemophilus influenzae, ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae, and Escherichia coli. Aztreonam was also compared with gentamicin in experimentally induced E. coli cerebritis in rats. Doses of the various agents were delivered that produced near-peak concentrations in serum comparable to those attained in humans on standard parenteral regimens. The percent penetration [( concentration in cerebrospinal fluid/concentration in serum] X 100) of aztreonam into purulent rabbit cerebrospinal fluid was 23% (versus 12, 27, and 21%, respectively, for ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and gentamicin). In experimental meningitis in vivo, aztreonam was more rapidly bactericidal than was ampicillin in ampicillin-susceptible H. influenzae meningitis, ampicillin or chloramphenicol in ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae meningitis, or gentamicin in E. coli meningitis. In the therapy of experimental cerebritis, the early stage of brain abscess formation, aztreonam reduced the numbers of E. coli in rat brain as rapidly as did gentamicin. Aztreonam deserves further evaluation in acute gram-negative bacterial infections of the central nervous system in both experimental animals and in humans.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in older neonates.
AB  - During a five-year period, 24 patients' conditions (age range, 2 to 6 weeks) were diagnosed, and they were treated for bacterial meningitis. Organisms recovered from the CSF included group B Streptococcus (n = 6), Escherichia coli (n = 5), Listeria monocytogenes (n = 5), Hemophilus influenzae (n = 4), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 2), and group D and group A Streptococcus (one each). Initial antimicrobial therapy must include antibiotics that are effective across this spectrum of potential pathogens. Symptoms and signs were often subtle. Six children (25%) experienced major neurologic residua, including five patients (21%) in whom hydrocephalus developed. Ultrasound examination of the head at the end of therapy was an effective technique for early assessment of neurologic sequelae.
TI  - Pathogenicity of encapsulated Bacteroides melaninogenicus group, B. oralis and B. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  - The pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the Bacteroides melaninogenicus (BM) group and four clinical isolates of B. oralis and B. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (SC) or intraperitoneal abscesses. Only 11 isolates of BM group and one B. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). When the other 23 isolates, however, were injected SC in combination with either Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. The Bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. Capsules also formed in Bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of K. pneumoniae or encapsulated Bacteroides sp. Once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.
TI  - A hemadsorption method for detection of colonies of Haemophilus influenzae type b expressing fimbriae.
AB  - Although fimbriated variants of Haemophilus influenzae type b have recently been  described, cultures of most clinical isolates contain only a small proportion of fimbriated forms. Because colonies of fimbriated and nonfimbriated cells are visually indistinguishable, a rapid, simple method was developed for the identification and quantitation of colonies of fimbriated H influenzae. This procedure, also applicable to other bacteria (for example, Escherichia coli), involves transferring the colonies from agar to nitrocellulose disks and incubating the disks in a suspension of red blood cells. Colonies that contain predominantly fimbriated bacteria bind the red blood cells and appear as red dots on the nitrocellulose. This nitrocellulose hemadsorption method is described, as well as its applicability for determining the proportion of fimbriated cells in a culture, the kinetics of enrichment of fimbriated forms during enrichment procedures, and the transition rate from the nonfimbriated to the fimbriated state.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of microbicidal cationic proteins 1 and 2, natural peptide antibiotics of rabbit lung macrophages.
AB  - Microbicidal cationic proteins 1 and 2, peptides derived from rabbit lung macrophages, were tested for bactericidal activity against various bacterial species. Both were highly active against diverse gram-positive and gram-negative organisms under conditions of near-neutral pH (between 7 and 8) and relatively low ionic strength. Susceptible species included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens. Streptococcus agalactiae, type 1A, was less susceptible than the aforementioned organisms or S. agalactiae, type 3. Bordetella bronchiseptica, a common commensal and pathogen of the rabbit respiratory tract, was completely resistant to both peptides.
TI  - Third-generation and investigational cephalosporins: II. Microbiologic review and clinical summaries.
AB  - In vitro susceptibility of Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Hemophilus influenzae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Neisseria gonorrhea to three new second-generation and eight third-generation cephalosporins is tabulated. In general, the newer cephalosporins have an extended spectrum of activity against gram-negative bacteria, including Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Neisseria gonorrhea. They also tend to be active against anaerobes, including Bacteroides fragilis. However, they generally have less activity against gram-positive bacteria when compared with the first- and second-generation cephalosporins. Clinical summaries are given for each of the cephalosporins, with emphasis on the results of comparative clinical trials. These cephalosporins may prove especially useful in nosocomial infections with resistant organisms, intraabdominal infections, febrile episodes in the granulocytopenic patient, and meningitis.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinical isolates in pediatrics to cefpiramide].
AB  - Cefpiramide (CPM, SM-1652) had broad-spectrum antibacterial activities against most of clinically isolated organisms to which are paid attention as pathogenic organism in the field of pediatrics. Antibacterial activities of CPM against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Bordetella pertussis and Proteus mirabilis were almost the same as those of cefoperazone (CPZ). Antibacterial activities of CPM against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were somewhat weaker than those of CPZ, but antibacterial activity of CPM against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was rather stronger than that of CPZ and almost the same as that of cefsulodin. Antibacterial activity of CPM has a tendency to decrease in beta-lactamase (PCase type) producing S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, H. Influenzae, etc. It is suggestive that the determination of not only the antibacterial activity of CPM against pathogenic organisms but also the beta-lactamase producing activity of them is important on the occasion of clinical use of CPM.
TI  - Characteristics of major outer membrane proteins of Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Several properties of Haemophilus influenzae outer membrane proteins were analyzed to define related proteins in various isolates. H. influenzae type b 760705 had six major outer membrane proteins with the following characteristics. Protein a (Mr, 47,000) demonstrated heat modifiability in sodium dodecyl sulfate; its apparent molecular weight was 34,000 at temperatures below 60 degrees C. This protein was extracted from cell envelopes by using Triton X-100-10 mM MgCl2; in cell envelope preparations, the protein was degraded by trypsin. Proteins b (Mr, 41,000) and c (Mr, 40,000) were insensitive to trypsin degradation, were not heat modifiable in sodium dodecyl sulfate, and were peptidoglycan associated in 0.5% Triton X-100-0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate. The amount of protein b was reduced in ultrasonically obtained cell envelopes. Protein d (Mr, 37,000) was heat modifiable in sodium dodecyl sulfate with an Mr of 28,000 at temperatures below 100 degrees C and was degraded by trypsin, leaving a membrane-bound fragment of Mr, 27,000. Both the intact and degraded proteins were immunologically cross-reactive with the heat-modifiable OmpA protein of Escherichia coli K-12. Protein d was absent in LiCl-EDTA extracts of cells. Protein e (Mr, 30,000), invariably present in all H. influenzae strains tested, was insensitive to trypsin and absent in LiCl-EDTA extracts of cells. Protein k (Mr, 58,000) was extracted from cell envelopes with 2% Triton X-100-10 mM MgCl2 and, in cell envelopes, appeared to be sensitive to trypsin degradation. Proteins with similar properties to those of proteins a to k were found in 10 other H. influenzae b strains, reference strains with serotype a, c, d, e, and f capsules, and 18 of 20 nonencapsulated strains. Their relative molecular weights, however, varied.

TI  - [Evaluation of in vitro antibacterial potencies of oral antibiotics against sputum isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility of 162 sputum isolates to oral antibiotics was measured by an agar dilution method. The sputum isolates included S. pneumoniae 25 strains, S. aureus 30 strains, H. influenzae 37 strains, K. pneumoniae 51 strains and E. coli 19 strains. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of cefaclor (CCL), cephalexin (CEX), ampicillin (ABPC) and minocycline (MINO) were measured for each strains. Eighty percent of S. pneumoniae strains were inhibited at 0.024 to 0.05 micrograms/ml of ABPC, 0.39 to 0.78 micrograms/ml of CCL, and 1.56 to 3.13 micrograms/ml of CEX and MINO. ABPC, CCL and CEX were considered to be effective clinically when they were used with the usual dosage. However, about 30% of strains were resistant to the usual dosage of orally administrated MINO. Eighty percent of S. aureus strains were inhibited at 0.20 to 0.39 microgram/ml of MINO and 3.13 to 6.25 micrograms/ml of the other 3 drugs. MINO is the most effective with the usual dosage. Twenty to 40% of strains showed resistance to CCL, CEX and ABPC. Eighty percent of H. influenzae strains were inhibited at 0.39 micrograms/ml of ABPC, 0.78 to 1.56 micrograms/ml of MINO, 3.13 micrograms/ml of CCL and 12.5 to 25 micrograms/ml of CEX. ABPC should be selected as the first choice antibiotic. However, there were 2 ABPC-resistant strains that were highly susceptible to CCL. Eighty percent of K. pneumoniae strains were inhibited at 0.39 to 0.78 micrograms/ml of CCL, 3.13 to 6.25 micrograms/ml of MINO and CEX, and 12.5 to 25 micrograms/ml of ABPC. CCL seemed to be only effective oral antibiotic for K. pneumoniae infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Bacterial meningitis--1982.
AB  - The etiologic agents in bacterial meningitis vary with time, geography, and patient age. Predominant pathogens are Escherichia coli, group B streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Approximately 70 percent of all cases occur in children under the age of five. The case-fatality rate in the United States in 1978 was 13.6 percent, but it is known that underreporting of cases, and therefore of case-fatalities, occurs. Prevention by vaccine appears to be the ultimate solution, but until a vaccine is developed emphasis should be on rapid diagnosis, improved management, and proper choice of antibiotic.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of Augmentin by broth microdilution and disk diffusion susceptibility testing: regression analysis, tentative interpretive criteria, and quality control limits.
AB  - Augmentin (Beecham Laboratories, Bristol, Tenn.), a combination drug consisting of two parts amoxicillin to one part clavulanic acid and a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor, was evaluated in vitro in comparison with ampicillin or amoxicillin or both for its inhibitory and bactericidal activities against selected clinical isolates. Regression analysis was performed and tentative disk diffusion susceptibility breakpoints were determined. A multicenter performance study of the disk diffusion test was conducted with three quality control organisms to determine tentative quality control limits. All methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and Haemophilus influenzae isolates were susceptible to Augmentin, although the minimal inhibitory concentrations for beta-lactamase-producing strains of both groups were, on the average, fourfold higher than those for enzyme-negative strains. Among the Enterobacteriaceae, Augmentin exhibited significantly greater activity than did ampicillin against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus vulgaris, and about one-third of the Escherichia coli strains tested. Bactericidal activity usually occurred at the minimal inhibitory concentration. There was a slight inoculum concentration effect on the Augmentin minimal inhibitory concentrations. On the basis of regression and error rate-bounded analyses, the suggested interpretive disk diffusion susceptibility breakpoints for Augmentin are: susceptible, greater than or equal to 18 mm; resistant, less than or equal to 13 mm (gram-negative bacilli); and susceptible, greater than or equal to 20 mm (staphylococci and H. influenzae). The use of a beta-lactamase-producing organism, such as E. coli Beecham 1532, is recommended for quality assurance of Augmentin susceptibility testing.
TI  - Induction of active immunity with membrane fractions from Haemophilus influenzae  type b.
AB  - Using Escherichia coli strain E-1 as a model, we developed procedures for the preparation of outer- and inner-membrane-enriched fractions as structural units. These procedures could be used to prepare relatively pure inner and outer membrane fractions as determined by succinate dehydrogenase activity, ketodeoxyoctonate levels, and polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis. The use of these procedures to fractionate membrane components from Haemophilus influenzae type b strains H-2 and H-E led to good separation of outer- and inner-membrane-enriched fractions as determined by succinate dehydrogenase and ketodeoxyoctonate levels but incomplete separation as determined by polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis. Although there were differences between the electrophoresis profiles of outer membrane fractions of strains H-2 and H-E, immunization with outer membrane of either strain led to the induction of a high degree of immunoprotection against challenge with the H-2 strain. Protection could also be elicited with inner membrane preparations, but such protection may be due to contamination with outer membrane. Extracted membrane protein induced levels of protection that were comparable to those induced by whole membrane fractions.
TI  - Evaluation of ceftazidime in the treatment of severe bacterial infection.
AB  - We investigated the clinical efficiency and safety of ceftazidime for treatment of 33 episodes of infection in 30 patients (17 males and 13 females), whose ages ranged from 9 to 92 years (mean 52.5). Fourteen patients had ultimately fatal disease and the remaining 16 had non-fatal diseases. The clinical condition of patients at the beginning of treatment was critical or poor in 16 cases. Episodes of infection treated were: 24 urinary tract infections (eight of them with concomitant bacteraemia), seven wound infections (one with concomitant bacteraemia and three with osteomyelitis), and two episodes of pneumonia. Twenty-nine episodes of infection were monomicrobial and the four remaining ones were polymicrobial. Significant organisms isolated were all aerobic or facultatively anaerobic Gram-negative rods and were responsible for the following episodes of infection: Escherichia coli (14), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12), Pseudomonas cepacia (1), Proteus mirabilis (5), Serratia marcescens (2), Klebsiella (2), Enterobacter aerogenes (1) and Haemophilus influenzae (1). Total dosage of ceftazidime ranged from 28 to 240 g (mean 82.4 g), and mean duration of therapy was 17 days (range 8 to 44 days). The overall rate of clinical response to ceftazidime was 91%. Local and general tolerance to the drug was excellent. Enterococcal and/or candida colonization occurred in 12 episodes (36%) and superinfections by the same micro-organisms occurred in three episodes. Ceftazidime seems to be an effective and safe single agent for therapy of many bacterial infections, including those caused by Ps. aeruginosa.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the BACTEC resin-containing blood culture bottle.
AB  - The BACTEC resin-containing blood culture bottle (16B; Johnston Laboratories) was designed to bind antibiotics and to support bacterial growth. However, only modest increases in the recovery rates of pathogens have been found in clinical studies. This in vitro study evaluated the ability of the 16B to recover organisms from human serum containing clinically achievable concentrations of antibiotics. Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, and a viridans streptococcus were added to serum containing antibiotic(s), and at various time intervals of antibiotic exposure, portions were removed and inoculated into both the 16B and the 6B (conventional aerobic) bottles. The studies of the kinetics of killing of the bacterial strains by the various antibiotics showed a good correlation between those combinations of bacteria-antibiotic(s) which produced slow killing and the combinations of bacteria-antibiotic(s) which were recovered preferentially in the 16B bottles. Low recovery rates were noted when the antibiotics killed the organisms rapidly. The indications for use of the resin-containing blood culture bottle should be limited to those situations in which the patient is receiving antibiotics and the bacteremia is suspected to involve a pathogen which is killed slowly by the administered drug(s) or when the bacteremia is continuous. The failure of the BACTEC 16B blood culture bottle to recover organisms may in part reflect the bactericidal activity of the antibiotics administered.
TI  - Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia requiring admission to hospital.
AB  - Patients who develop bacterial pneumonia in the community often require admission to acute-care hospitals. Knowledge of the incidence of pneumonia due to different pathogens that are brought into an institution from the community may play a role in determining the patterns of infecting organisms responsible for hospital-acquired pneumonia. For 1 year, we prospectively reviewed the records of patients admitted to our 1000-bed community hospital with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). Patients had clinical signs and symptoms, positive radiologic findings, and pure cultures of potential pathogens from sputum, blood, pleural fluid, lung aspirate, lung biopsy, or transtracheal aspirate. Pneumonia due to Legionella pneumophila was diagnosed by serum indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) titer greater than or equal to 1:256 and clinical signs and symptoms along with response to erythromycin. Of 204 patients with bacterial pneumonia, the following pathogens were implicated: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus species, L. pneumophila, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, oral anaerobic bacteria, Psuedomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and others. Most patients were more than 50 years of age and many had evidence of underlying pulmonary disease. The etiology of CABP may not be as predictable as in the past. Empiric antimicrobial therapy for CABP should include agents with activity against the pathogens prevalent in the community.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin in vitro.
AB  - Fosfomycin is a new bactericidal broad-spectrum antibiotic. In this study the minimum inhibiting concentration (MIC) was determined for 745 recent clinical isolates. Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, group A and B streptococci Streptococcus faecalis and pneumoniae as well as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens and Haemophilus influenzae were very sensitive to the new drug with essentially all strains inhibited at 64 mg/l or less. Klebsiella, Enterobacter, indole-positive proteus and Pseudomonas-aeruginosa were less sensitive with 96, 42, 66 and 58% inhibited at 64 mg/l of fosfomycin. Bacteroides fragilis was resistant.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide-mediated antagonism against serratia marcescens by Streptococcus mitis.
AB  - The alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus mitis strain no. 17-1, isolated from the oral cavity of an healthy female adult, antagonized the growth of all 24 test strains of Serratia marcescens examined; furthermore, this strain inhibited the growth of various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae. However, strans of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved refractory. The mechanism of microbial antagonism was due to production and release of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic atmospheric conditions, which was neutralized through incorporation of bovine liver catalase into the solid assay medium.
TI  - IgA1 proteases of Haemophilus influenzae: cloning and characterization in Escherichia coli K-12.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae is one of several bacterial pathogens known to release IgA1 proteases into the extracellular environment. Each H. influenzae isolate produces one of at least three distinct types of these enzymes that differ in the specific peptide bond they cleave in the hinge region of human IgA1. We have isolated the gene specifying type 1 IgA1 protease from a total genomic library of H. influenzae, subcloned it into plasmid vectors, and introduced these vectors into Escherichia coli K-12. The enzyme synthesized by E. coli was active and had the same specificity as that of the H. influenzae donor. Unlike that of the donor, E. coli protease activity accumulated in the periplasm rather than being transported extracellularly. The position of the protease gene in H. influenzae DNA and its direction of transcription was approximated by deletion mapping. Tn5 insertions, and examination of the polypeptides synthesized by minicells. A 1-kilobase probe excised from the IgA1 protease gene hybridized with DNA restriction fragments of all H. influenzae serogroups but not with DNA of a nonpathogenic H. parainfluenzae species known to be IgA1 protease negative.
TI  - Further studies on the immunogenicity of Haemophilus influenzae type b and pneumococcal type 6A polysaccharide-protein conjugates.
AB  - Conjugates were prepared by carbodiimide-mediated coupling of adipic acid hydrazide derivatives of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Escherichia coli K100, and pneumococcal 6A (Pn6A) polysaccharides with tetanus toxoid (TT), as an example of a "useful" carrier, and horseshoe crab hemocyanin (HCH), as an example of a "nonsense" carrier. These conjugates were injected into NIH mice, and their serum antibody responses to the polysaccharides and proteins were characterized. As originally reported, Hib conjugates increased the immunogenicity of the capsular polysaccharide and elicited greater than the estimated protective levels of anti-Hib antibodies in most recipients after one injection and in all after the third injection (Schneerson et al., J. Exp. Med. 152:361-376, 1980). Both Hib conjugates induced similar anti-Hib responses. The K100-HCH conjugate was more immunogenic than the K100-TT conjugate and elicited anti-Hib responses similar to the Hib conjugates after the third injection. Simultaneous injection of the K100 and the Hib conjugates did not enhance the anti-Hib response. The Pn6A-TT conjugate induced low levels of anti-Hib antibodies; when injected simultaneously with the Hib conjugates, the anti-Hib response was enhanced, as all mice responded after the first injection and with higher levels of anti-Hib than observed with the Hib conjugates alone (P < 0.05). The Pn6A conjugates were not as immunogenic as the Hib conjugates. Pn6A-TT was more effective than was Pn6A-HCH; it elicited anti-Pn6A (>100 ng of antibody nitrogen per ml) in 6 of 10 mice after the third injection. The addition of the Hib-HCH conjugate to the Pn6A-TT conjugate increased the anti-Pn6A response with a higher geometric mean antibody titer, and 9 of 10 mice responded after the third injection. A preparation of diphtheria toxoid, TT, and pertussis vaccine increased the anti-Hib antibody levels after the first injection only in mice receiving Hib-TT, but not in mice receiving Hib-HCH, suggesting that additional carrier protein (TT) enhanced the anti-polysaccharide response. Simultaneous injection of Hib and Pn6A conjugates with the same or different carriers resulted in an enhanced serum antibody response to each polysaccharide. The anti-tetanus toxin response reached protective levels (>0.01 U/ml) in most mice after the first injection and in all mice after the second and third injections of TT conjugates. A progressive increase in the anti-HCH response with each additional injection was noted in animals receiving HCH conjugates. Animals receiving the diphtheria toxoid-TT-pertussis vaccine preparation responded with a greater increase in anti-carrier antibody than those receiving the conjugates alone. This method of synthesis provided conjugates capable of inducing protective levels of antibodies to both the polysaccharides and carrier proteins.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies of T-1982 (cefbuperazone) in pediatric infectious diseases].
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies were carried out with T-1982 (cefbuperazone) in pediatric infectious diseases. Results were as follows. 1. The average serum concentrations of T-1982 following intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg were 35.3, 64.7 micrograms/ml at 30 minutes, 25.5, 41.5 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, 12.4, 21.8 micrograms/ml at 2 hours, respectively. Dose-response was observed. Urinary recovery rates of T-1982 during 6 hours after injection of 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg were 57.3% and 73.6%, respectively. 2. The antibacterial activity of T-1982 against clinically isolated organisms was determined. T-1982 was more active than cefazolin and cefmetazole against K. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and E. coli. It was also effective against ampicillin-resistant E. coli. 3. Thirty-seven patients received daily 30-69 mg/kg of T-1982 t.i.d. for 5-9 days. The rate of satisfactory clinical response was 91.9%. 4. Side effects were diarrhea in 4 cases, diarrhea and rash in 1 case and slight elevation of GOT and GPT in 1 case. But these were transient and mild.

TI  - [Clinical studies of T-1982 (cefbuperazone) in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - T-1982 (cefbuperazone), a new cephamycin antibiotic, was clinically and bacteriologically studied in 25 children with bacterial infections. The following results were obtained. 1. The antibacterial activity of T-1982 was determined against clinically isolated bacteria. T-1982 demonstrated excellent activity against Gram-negative bacilli, the MICs being less than 0.39 microgram/ml against E. coli and K. oxytoca, less than 1.56 microgram/ml against H. influenzae. 2. Clinical response was excellent or good in all 24 cases evaluated. The efficacy rate was 100%. 3. As for side effects associated with T-1982, slight and transient elevation of GOT, GPT and eosinophil, slight decrease of platelet and eruption were observed. From these results, T-1982 is considered to be a useful antibiotic for treating bacterial infections in children.

TI  - [Clinical experience with T-1982 (cefbuperazone) in the pediatric field].
AB  - T-1982 (cefbuperazone) was given intravenously to 21 children with the following  acute bacterial infections; 13 cases of bronchopneumonia, 2 cases of urinary tract infection, 1 case of subcutaneous abscess, 1 case of cervical purulent lymphadenitis and acute tonsillitis, and 4 cases of acute bronchitis. Clinical effectiveness was obtained in 20 cases out of 21 cases and bacteriological effectiveness in 7 cases out of 8 cases. As for the side effects, 1 patient had asymptomatic eosinophilia, but no other laboratory abnormalities were observed. Above results suggest that T-1982 is a useful antibiotic for treating pediatric patients with various kinds of bacterial infections.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of T-1982 (cefbuperazone) in the pediatric infections].
AB  - T-1982 (cefbuperazone) was evaluated in 25 children with a suspicion of bacterial infections, of the 21 confirmed bacterial infections, 18 were shown to be effective (efficacy rate, 85.7%). The diagnosis included pneumonia (4), bronchopneumonia (3), acute bronchitis (4), acute pharyngitis (1), acute laryngitis (1), acute epiglottitis (1), acute enterocolitis (3), cervical lymphadenitis (1), acute pyelonephritis (1) and suspected septicemia (2). The etiologic pathogens recovered were Haemophilus influenzae (4), Staphylococcus aureus (2), Salmonella typhimurium (1), Salmonella subgenus (1), and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (2). Among these strains, 7 strains were eradicated after treatment. A case of suspected septicemia and 2 cases of acute enterocolitis with Salmonella infection were not effectively treated with T-1982. The serum half-life of T-1982 was 1.2 hours after an intravenous bolus injection. No severe adverse reaction was encountered with the T-1982 therapy. The data suggest that T-1982 is an effective and safe parenteral antibiotic in the treatment of susceptible pediatric bacterial infections.
TI  - Effect of growth phase on the bactericidal action of chloramphenicol against Haemophilus influenzae type b and Escherichia coli K-1.
AB  - The bactericidal action of chloramphenicol against six Haemophilus influenzae type b isolates and six Escherichia coli K-1 isolates was compared. Cells were grown in antibiotic-free medium into the late-stationary and mid-exponential phases of growth, and inocula of 10(5) to 10(6) cells per ml were added to fresh media containing 1 or 10 micrograms of chloramphenicol per ml for H. influenzae isolates, 80 micrograms of chloramphenicol per ml for E. coli isolates, or no chloramphenicol (antibiotic free). Quantitative kinetic studies indicated that each chloramphenicol concentration killed H. influenzae cells in the stationary phase of growth significantly more rapidly than it did those in the exponential phase of growth (P less than 0.001; analysis of variance). E. coli in either the stationary or the exponential phase were killed at the same rate by 80 micrograms of chloramphenicol per ml (P greater than 0.05). These results suggest that chloramphenicol may kill these organisms by different mechanisms.
TI  - Selection of antimicrobial agents for initial treatment of suspected septicemia in infants and children.
AB  - Septicemia is relatively common in infants and children, and empiric antimicrobial therapy is frequently necessary. In immunocompetent children the most likely causative agents are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Salmonella species. Effective empiric therapy is often the combination of ampicillin and chloramphenicol. In immunocompromised children the etiologic possibilities in septicemia include a large number of opportunistic pathogens, the most common of which are Escherichia coli and other enteric bacilli, Pseudomonas species and other hospital-related bacilli, and Staphylococcus aureus. Empiric therapy often consists of an aminoglycoside, a penicillinase-resistant penicillin or cephalosporin, and carbenicillin or ticarcillin. The third-generation cephalosporins offer considerable promise in the empiric treatment of septicemia in children.
TI  - The isolation of thymidine-requiring Haemophilus influenzae from the sputum of chronic bronchitic patients receiving trimethoprim.
AB  - Two different strains of thymidine-requiring Haemophilus influenzae (thy-) were isolated from the sputum of two patients with chronic obstructive airways disease, during therapy with oral trimethoprim for the treatment of an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. Both patients responded clinically. Since trimethoprim levels in sputum and serum were very low the patients were probably non-compliant. Isolates of H. influenzae prototrophic for thymidine (thy+) were isolated from both patients in remission before, at the onset of exacerbation and also within two weeks of stopping therapy. Thy- and thy+ isolates from the same patient were of identical biotype but isolates from the two patients were of different biotypes. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of trimethoprim for the thy+ isolates obtained after therapy was significantly higher than the MIC for the isolates obtained at the onset of exacerbation. Thy- isolates were further investigated and a novel mechanism of low-level trimethoprim resistance is proposed.
TI  - Rapid method for screening large numbers of Escherichia coli colonies for production of plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases.
AB  - A rapid, simple assay for screening large numbers of Escherichia coli colonies for production of certain plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (including TEM-1, TEM-2, HMS-1, SHV-1, OXA-1, PSE-1, PSE-4, and CEP-2) is described. The technique, a modification of the method of Slack et al. for detection of beta-lactamase in limited numbers of Haemophilus influenzae clinical isolates (Lancet ii:906, 1977), uses filter paper impregnated with benzylpenicillin and a pH indicator dye (bromocresol purple) that changes color in the presence of beta-lactamase activity. The test paper is briefly applied to an agar surface containing bacterial colonies which are subsequently scored individually on the paper by color: yellow indicates the presence of beta-lactamase, dark green its absence, and variegation (yellow and dark green) a mixed population. Concordance of the results of this assay with those of replica plating for antibiotic resistance was over 99%. Hundreds of colonies per plate can be scored quickly and remain viable for further evaluation. The assay appears to be useful for studies of the stability of plasmids encoding beta-lactamases and in cloning with vectors such as pBR322 in which insertion of DNA fragments can be detected by inactivation of the beta-lactamase gene. Whenever the assay is to be used, results should always be confirmed initially by another method, such as replica plating, because the test paper assay does not detect three beta-lactamases (OXA-2, OXA-3, and PSE-2) and also would miss intrinsic penicillin resistance.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics and bacteriological effect of ceftazidime in experimental Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Escherichia coli meningitis.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics and bacteriological effect of ceftazidime were evaluated in  rabbits experimentally infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Escherichia coli K1. The mean penetration of ceftazidime into cerebrospinal fluid after single-dose or constant-infusion administration ranged from 7.8 to 14.9%. The median cerebrospinal fluid bactericidal titers were 1:64 against S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae and 1:128 against E. coli. The bacterial colony counts in cerebrospinal fluid were reduced by 58% to 100% (-2.3 to -3.9 log10 CFU/ml) in 3 h and by 100% (-3.2 to -5.1 log10 CFU/ml) in 9 h of constant infusion, whereas in untreated infected animals, bacterial counts increased from +1.4 to +2.1 log10 CFU/ml in 9 h. These data on ceftazidime compare favorably with those on penicillin, chloramphenicol, netilmicin, and moxalactam in this experimental meningitis model.
TI  - Specific immune response in the respiratory tract after administration of an oral polyvalent bacterial vaccine.
AB  - An oral killed polyvalent bacterial vaccine was assessed in a double-blind trial  involving healthy volunteers. Three courses of oral vaccine were given over a 2-month period; each course contained 10(10) Haemophilus influenzae and 7 X 10(9) Staphylococcus aureus organisms. Immunity was assessed by monitoring antibody in saliva and serum over a 3-month period. No evidence of a nonspecific effect on immune parameters (immunoglobulin levels and Escherichia coli antibody) was detected in saliva or serum. An increase in H. influenzae antibody in saliva was detected in 55% of subjects receiving the vaccine compared with 6.7% of the placebo group. Antibody was associated with immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgG, and IgM, but the greatest increases over preimmunization levels were detected in the IgA class. No increase in serum antibody levels was detected. Subjects with higher preimmunization levels of salivary antibody to H. influenzae were less likely to respond to the oral bacterial vaccine. No increase in S. aureus antibody was detected in saliva or serum.
TI  - Bacterial cell wall components decrease the number of guinea-pig lung beta-adrenoceptors.
AB  - Infections of the deeper respiratory airways can contribute to the progression of chronic asthmatic bronchitis. In the present report a number of microorganisms affecting the number of beta-adrenoceptors in guinea-pig lung homogenates are described. Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis and Escherichia coli O111B4 induced a significant decrease of the number of beta-adrenoceptors (by approximately 20%). Staphylococcus aureus, influenza A virus and Escherichia coli J5 were not active. These data point to a common factor shared by gram-negative bacilli; i.e. endotoxin. Purified endotoxin of E. coli O111B4 also decreased the number of beta-adrenoceptors, while E. coli J5-LPS did not. This suggests that neutral polysaccharides of bacterial cell walls, especially those in the 'O'-antigenic side chain of gram-negative endotoxins may be responsible for the decrease of beta-adrenoceptor number and therefore contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic asthmatic bronchitis. Intact endotoxin seems to be necessary since neither the isolated lipid nor the polysaccharide part of E. coli O111B4 LPS affected the number of beta-adrenoceptors in the lung.
TI  - Transtracheal aspiration in pulmonary infection in children with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Six transtracheal aspirations (TTA) and expectorated sputum specimens were collected from four children suffering from cystic fibrosis who had pulmonary infection. Specimens obtained from both sites were cultured for aerobic bacteria and TTA aspirates were also cultured for anaerobes. Differences in bacteria isolated in TTA and sputum aspirates were present in all instances. Six isolates were recovered in both sites (three Pseudomonas aeruginosa, two Staphylococcus aureus and one Aspergillus flavus). Five aerobic isolates were recovered only in the expectorated sputum and not in TTA aspirations (two Klebsiella pneumoniae and one each of P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis). Nine organisms were isolated only from the TTA (two each of Veillonella parvula and Alpha hemolytic streptococci, and one each of Bacteroides fragilis, B. melaninogenicus, Lactobacillus sp., Haemophilus influenzae and Gamma hemolytic streptococci). The recovery of anaerobic organisms from four of the six TTA specimens suggests a possible role for these organisms in the etiology of pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis. We found TTA to be helpful in the bacterial diagnosis and management of pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis.
TI  - Application of S. faecalis and E. coli oral vaccines in humans and animals.
AB  - Vaccines of non-pathogenic intestinal bacteria for oral administration have been  used in the therapy of chronic and recurrent infections by the German Medical Association for Microbiological Therapy for over three decades. Three different oral bacterial vaccines were used in particular: 1. A sterile autolysate of non-pathogenic S. faecalis and E. coli; 2. a viable non-pathogenic S. faecalis vaccine, and; 3. a viable non-pathogenic E. coli vaccine. Clinical studies indicate the safety and efficacy of these bacterial products, and suggest the stimulation of immune activities and competitive capacities of S. faecalis and E. coli as mode of action. In animal experiments, orally administered intestinal bacterial vaccines enhance the resistance of mice against subsequent challenge with lethal doses of Salmonella typhimurium and Haemophilus influenzae. Mice were allowed access to a viable suspension of either S. faecalis or E. coli for at least 3 weeks. They were then challenged with either of the two unrelated pathogens. Both pre-treatment procedures conferred significant protection of the animals. The mechanism of this protective action appears to involve modification of white blood cell kinetics in the mice. The peritoneal resident cell population in mice is significantly increased by S. faecalis treatment.
TI  - Bacterial plasmids--an overview.
AB  - Resistance to antimicrobial substances and various factors contributing to pathogenicity are only some of the bacterial traits that can be determined by plasmid genes. Not all plasmids are involved with resistance, nor is all resistance to antimicrobials plasmid-mediated. Nevertheless, the impact of R-plasmids on the choice of antimicrobial therapy is substantial, especially in hospital and when dealing with certain community pathogens, such as Haemophilus influenzae. The discovery of transposition elements has helped us to understand the rapidity with which certain resistance determinants develop and become disseminated among diverse microbial species. Similarly, not all determinants of microbial pathogenicity are plasmid encoded and the genes for many toxins, cellular attachment pili, iron sequestration systems, etc. are found on the bacterial chromosomes. In Yersinia, pathogenicity is even more complex in that plasmid determinants play an essential role, but only in concert with chromosomal genes. The particularly significant features of such pathogenicity-determined plasmid-mediated genes is not that they are found on extrachromosomal elements, but that they may possess greater genetic mobility. Another consequence of the presence of virulence genes on bacterial plasmids is that it makes them easier to study by the newer techniques of microbial genetics and molecular biology.
TI  - Clinical trial of bacampicillin in acute bacterial infections.
AB  - A clinical trial of bacampicillin was carried out in 20 patients. The antibiotic  was found to be effective in acute lobar pneumonia, pyogenic meningitis, acute and chronic bronchitis, acute pharyngitis, acute tonsillitis, cellulitis, furunculosis, and pyomyositis caused by such ampicillin-sensitive organisms as Neisseria meningitidis, Diplococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. Rash in three patients was the only side effect encountered. It is concluded that while bacampicillin may have overcome some of the disadvantages of ampicillin, it retains its main attributes and some shortcomings.
TI  - Laboratory evaluation of cefmenoxime: a new cephalosporin. In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities and pharmacokinetic properties.
AB  - Cefmenoxime is a new syn-methoxyimino cephalosporin antibiotic derived from cefotiam, which has been proved to be a very effective and useful antibiotic for the treatment of respiratory infections. This bacteriological and pharmacokinetic study was therefore performed in order to evaluate the potency of cefmenoxime in the treatment of respiratory infections. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of cefmenoxime against 179 isolates of respiratory pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae 53, Haemophilus influenzae 64, Klebsiella pneumoniae 43, Escherichia coli 9, Enterobacter spp. 10) were less than 0.20 micrograms/ml, and 43 (73%) of 60 Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml. In vitro antibacterial activity of cefmenoxime was superior to 18 other antibiotics, including cefotiam and cefotaxime tested in this study. Pharmacokinetic studies on tissue distribution in rats, serum levels and urinary excretion in 3 healthy volunteers, and penetration into bronchial secretes of 9 patients with respiratory infections, revealed that cefmenoxime has a higher penetration into the lung and bronchial secretes compared with cefotiam and cefotaxime. In 1 patient with chronic bronchiolitis, the concentration of cefmenoxime in the intra-bronchial secrete reached 12.5 micrograms/ml. From these results, it is concluded that cefmenoxime is a highly potent and useful antibiotic, and may be more effective in the treatment of respiratory infections than many other cephalosporins, including cefazolin, cefotiam and cefotaxime.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activity of DL-8280, a new oxazine derivative.
AB  - DL-8280, 9-fluoro-3-methyl-10-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-7-oxo-2,3-dihydro-7H- pyrido-(1,2,3-de)1,4-benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid, is a new nalidixic acid analog with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including obligate anaerobes. The activity of DL-8280 against Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Clostridium perfringens was roughly comparable to that of norfloxacin and far exceeded that of pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid. DL-8280 had greater activity against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Pseudomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter spp., and Bacteroides fragilis than did norfloxacin, pipemidic acid, and nalidixic acid. Nalidixic acid-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, ampicillin-resistant gonococci, and clindamycin-resistant obligate anaerobes were also susceptible to DL-8280. The activity of DL-8280 was affected very little by inoculum size, and its action was bactericidal at two times the minimal inhibitory concentrations at most. Administered orally to mice experimentally infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, or P. aeruginosa, DL-8280 was 2 to 7 times more effective than norfloxacin and 7 to more than 50 times more active than pipemidic acid.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies of cefmenoxime in pediatric infections].
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (CMX) against clinical isolated organisms was measured; CMX was more active than cefotiam and cefazolin against Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae. The serum concentrations of CMX following intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg were 25.6, 10.3, 3.0 micrograms/ml at 30, 60, 120 minutes after injection, respectively. CMX was excreted 60.9% in urine within 6 hours after injection. CMX was administered clinically to 22 pediatric patients with various infections (respiratory tract infection 16 including 1 pyothorax, urinary tract infection 4, tonsillitis with sinusitis 2) at the dose of 39 approximately 96 mg/kg/day for 4 approximately 9 days, and the following satisfactory results were obtained; excellent in 11, good in 9, and poor in 2. The rate of satisfactory clinical response was 90.9%. Eosinophilia 2 cases, slight elevation of transaminase 3 cases, slight elevation of BUN 1 case and transient diarrhea 1 case were observed. But no other serious side effects were observed.
TI  - [Clinical studies on cefmenoxime in pediatric field].
AB  
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefmenoxime in the pediatric infections].
AB  - Cefmenoxime (CMX) was evaluated in 25 children with a suspicion of bacterial infection. Of the 20 confirmed bacterial infections, 19 were cured by CMX therapy (effective rate, 95%). The diagnoses included acute pharyngotonsillitis (4), acute bronchitis (1), pneumonia (7), streptococcal dacryocystitis (1), infections accompanied with acute leukemia (4), and acute urinary tract infections (3). The etiologic pathogens were beta-hemolytic Streptococcus group A (1), and F (1), Staphylococcus aureus (4), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Escherichia coli (4), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2), etc. CMX was very effective for 2 children with respiratory infections due to ampicillin resistant H. influenzae type b. The half life of serum concentration of CMX was 0.76 +/- 0.17 hour after an intravenous bolus injection. A cerebrospinal fluid level of CMX was 5.2 mcg/ml 1 hour after intravenous injection of 1 g (23.8 mg/kg) in a child with inflamed meninges. However this level was not as high as those of cefotaxime, latamoxef, or ceftizoxime measured in the same case. No severe adverse reaction was encountered with CMX therapy. The data suggest that CMX is a safe and effective parenteral antibiotic when used in children with susceptible bacterial infections.
TI  - Comparison of cefoperazone with penicillin, ampicillin, gentamicin, and chloramphenicol in the therapy of experimental meningitis.
AB  - Cefoperazone was compared with penicillin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, gentamicin against Escherichia coli, and ampicillin and chloramphenicol against Haemophilus influenzae in the therapy of experimental meningitis in rabbits. Meningitis was produced by intracisternal inoculation into cerebrospinal fluid, and all antibiotics were administered intravenously over 8 h in dosages that would achieve serum levels comparable to those found in humans. The mean percent penetration into purulent cerebrospinal fluid, expressed as (cerebrospinal fluid concentration/serum concentration) x 100%, was 2.6% for penicillin, 22.0% for gentamicin, 12.1% for ampicillin, 23.8% for chloramphenicol, and 6.4% for cefoperazone. The mean cerebrospinal fluid antibiotic concentrations exceeded the minimum bactericidal concentration for the test strain in each experimental model, except for ampicillin in experimental meningitis due to the beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae. Cefoperazone produced a significantly faster bactericidal effect after 4 h of treatment when compared with penicillin (P = 0.037) and ampicillin (P = 0.01) in meningitis caused by S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae (ampicillin susceptible), respectively. In meningitis caused by E. coli, cefoperazone was significantly (P = 0.006) more rapidly bactericidal after 8 h of treatment when compared to gentamicin. In addition, cefoperazone was significantly more rapidly bactericidal than either ampicillin or chloramphenicol in experimental meningitis due to beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae. Cefoperazone deserves further evaluation in the therapy of bacterial meningitis in humans.
TI  - The latex agglutination test versus counterimmunoelectrophoresis for rapid diagnosis of bacterial meningitis.
AB  - A modified latex agglutination (LA) test was compared with Gram-staining and counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE) for the rapid detection in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of antigen to Haemophilus influenzae type b, Neisseria meningitidis groups A, B and C, Escherichia coli K1, Streptococcus pneumoniae and group B streptococci, seven frequent causes of bacterial meningitis in children. Of 50 CSF samples from patients with culture-proven bacterial meningitis 90% were correctly shown by the LA test to contain antigen of the responsible organism. Gram-staining revealed organisms in 80% of 45 of these samples. In 75% of the 40 samples that were of sufficient volume for CIE, positive results for the appropriate antigen were obtained. The concentration of antigen detected in the CSF by the LA test varied from undetectable to 800 000 ng/ml. Patients with a high concentration (more than 2000 ng/ml or a positive result at dilutions of CSF over 1/8) were significantly more likely to have a poor response to therapy (two died and two had persistent pleocytosis or bacteria in the CSF) than patients with a lower concentration (4/16 v. 0/18, P < 0.05). After appropriate therapy was begun the concentration of antigen fell dramatically, but measurable amounts of antigen persisted in the CSF for up to 6 days. The LA test detected bacterial antigen at concentrations 2 to 70 times below the lower limit detected by CIE. In seven additional patients who had received antibiotics before lumbar puncture was performed the LA test detected antigen from meningitis-causing bacteria even though cultures of the CSF were sterile. In another 145 patients who did not have meningitis the results of the LA test were negative. The LA test, done as described in this article, is easier to perform than CIE and should be a useful addition to the diagnostic tests carried out on the CSF of any patient suspected of having meningitis.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of temocillin.
AB  - Temocillin, a 6-alpha-methoxy penicillin, inhibited 90% of strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter, Proteus, Providencia, Salmonella, and Shigella at a concentration of less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoea were inhibited by less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. Changing the medium or pH of the cultures did not alter the minimal inhibitory concentrations, which were similar in broth and human serum, as were the minimal bactericidal concentrations. An increase in inoculum size from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units increased concentration required for inhibition. Temocillin inhibited strains resistant to ampicillin, ticarcillin, cefazolin, cefamandole, and cefoxitin. Most Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains and other Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp. were resistant, as were gram-positive organisms. Temocillin was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases but inhibited them. The resistance of certain gram-negative bacilli to temocillin seemed to be a result of failure of the molecule to enter through the cell wall, since combination of temocillin with EDTA made Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Enterobacter strains susceptible to low concentrations of the compound.
TI  - Treatment of gram-negative bacillary meningitis: role of the new cephalosporin antibiotics.
AB  - Results of the treatment of gram-negative bacillary meningitis have been disappointing: mortality is extremely high, and treatment with chloramphenicol has shown a high failure rate. This failure rate for chloramphenicol is consistent with the wide gap between minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration of this drug for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and other Enterobacteriaceae. Cefotaxime, a new cephalosporin, is cidal for most gram-negative bacteria at concentrations of less than 0.25 microgram/ml. By late 1981, 137 patients with meningitis due to a variety of bacteria had been treated with this agent. Bacteriologic cure rates were 93% for meningitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae and 88% for meningitis due to gram-negative bacteria (94.4% for meningitis due to E. coli and Klebsiella). This new antibiotic shows considerable promise in the treatment of these forms of meningitis.
TI  - Clinical trials of cefotaxime for the treatment of bacterial infections of the lower respiratory tract.
AB  - The efficacy of cefotaxime sodium for treatment of patients with lower respiratory infections was evaluated by three protocols in multicenter trials. The first trial studied cefotaxime alone; the second and third trials compared cefotaxime with cefazolin in observer-blind and single-blind randomized controlled studies, respectively. A total of 656 patients were entered in the three trials; 527 received cefotaxime. Overall rates of bacteriologic and clinical cure, analyzed by pathogen, for the cefotaxime treated patients were 89.9% and 93.9%, respectively. In the two comparative trials, overall rates of bacteriologic and clinical cure with cefotaxime, by pathogen, were greater than 94% and numerically exceeded those for cefazolin in each instance. The efficacies in the comparative studies, when analyzed by total patient responses, were significantly different only for clinical responses to cefotaxime in the single-blind randomized trial (P = 0.03). Favorable cure rates with cefotaxime were obtained in patients with infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli, and nearly comparable responses were obtained for infections due to Proteus, Enterobacter, and Klebsiella species. Cefotaxime was clinically effective in some of the infections due to Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but bacteriologic failures occurred in 67% and 61% of cases, respectively. All Serratia strains were highly susceptible in vitro to cefotaxime, but the range of minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefotaxime for Pseudomonas isolates was wide.
TI  - Comparative activity of cefotaxime and selected beta-lactam antibiotics against Haemophilus influenzae and aerobic gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - The activity of cefotaxime was compared with that of ampicillin, moxalactam, and  cefoperozone against 50 isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and with that of ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefamandole, cefazolin, and several other established and investigational beta-lactam antibiotics against several hundred isolates of gram-negative aerobic enteric bacilli. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of the drugs were determined by the agar plate dilution technique for H. influenzae and by the microtiter broth dilution technique for the other pathogens. Cefotaxime was the most active agent against H. influenzae; it was 20 times more active than ampicillin. It was also the most active agent against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, nontyphoid Salmonella species, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Cefotaxime was among the most active agents against Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter species, Shigella species, Proteus mirabilis, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. None of the new cephalosporins or penicillin inhibited greater than 90% of the isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at concentrations of less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml; these drugs were, however, more active than carbenicillin.
TI  - A plasmid cloning vehicle for Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli.
AB  - A new plasmid cloning vehicle (pDM2) was used to introduce a library of Haemophilus influenzae chromosomal fragments into H. influenzae. Transformants of the highly recombination-defective rec-1 mutant were more likely to contain exclusively recombinant plasmids after exposure to ligated DNA mixtures than was the wild type. pDM2 could replicate in Escherichia coli K-12.
TI  - Relationship between naturally occurring human mucosal and serum antibody to the  capsular polysaccharide of Haemophilus influenzae type b.
AB  - The prevalence of natural mucosal antibody to the capsular polysaccharide (polyribosylribitolphosphate [PRP]) of Haemophilus influenzae type b in adults at multiple secretory sites and the relationship between natural serum and mucosal antibodies with respect to their amount and fine binding specificity were examined. All of 16 lactating women had antibody to PRP in serum and mammary samples; 11 of 14 studied had nasal antibody and 12 of 14 had salivary antibody. The amount of serum antibody to PRP in an individual positively correlated with the amount of mucosal antibody at each of the three secretory sites examined, and the antibody amount between certain secretions were also positively correlated. Antibody to PRP that is cross-reactive with Escherichia coli K100 or Streptococcus pneumoniae type 6 capsular polysaccharides was detected in the secretions of seven and one subjects, respectively, but the amount was not correlated with serum cross-reactive antibody.
TI  - The history and background of Augmentin.
AB  - Bacterial resistance to the beta-lactam group of antibiotics is frequently due to the production of beta-lactamase which brings about the inactivation of the antibiotic. Clavulanic acid is a naturally occurring inhibitor of beta-lactamase which is capable of rendering penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant organisms sensitive. The compound is obtained by fermentation from Streptomyces clavuligerus. Clavulanic acid shows some structural similarity to the penicillins and cephalosporins and functions as a progressive inhibitor of a wide range of beta-lactamases including those found in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus species, Bacteroides fragilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Staphylococcus aureus. Clavulanic acid is well absorbed when given by mouth and a formulation with amoxycillin (Augmentin; Beechams) is now available for clinical use.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis. A follow-up study of 115 children.
AB  - The clinical and laboratory date on 115 pediatric patients with bacterial meningitis are presented. Sixty-one were less than 12 mo of age including 13 less than 1 mo of age. Thirty-nine children were treated prior to admission with antimicrobial agents which obscured accurate bacteriologic diagnosis in eight of them. Gram-negative enteric bacteria, mainly Escherichia coli, were recorded in 9 of 13 neonates. Hemophilus influenzae type B accounted for 56 (52%) of all isolated recorded in those greater than 2 mo of age, of which 35% were resistant to chloramphenicol. Seventy-eight patients (73%) recovered completely following 10 to 14 days of antimicrobial therapy. Fifteen patients died, most of whom were less than 1 yr of age, including five neonates. Major neurologic sequelae included subdural effusions, cerebral abscesses and recurrent convulsions. This study, which documents the infrequency of Streptococcus group B and H. influenzae as etiological agents of neonatal meningitis, indicates that treatment of this disease with ampicillin and an aminoglycoside is efficacious. Chloramphenicol may be the drug of choice in the postnatal period, since H. influenzae is partly resistant to ampicillin.
TI  - The unspecific antibody response to N. meningitidis group A capsular polysaccharide often seen in bacteraemic diseases.
AB  - When studying acute and convalescent phase sera of patients with bacteraemic diseases, an unexpected rise of antibody activity (measured as binding of radioactive antigen) towards the capsular polysaccharide of Neisseria meningitidis group A (MenA) was observed in 59 out of 292 patients whose infection was caused by other organisms (other groups of N. meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus). This non-specific reaction was not seen in non-bacteraemic diseases (Mycoplasma pneumonia, viral meningitis) or after immunization with H. influenzae type b capsular polysaccharide or Salmonella and cholera whole cell vaccines. The 'unspecific' anti-MenA antibodies were of all immunoglobulin classes A, G and M tested, and had lower avidity than did those in the specific response. They were clearly inhibitable by N-acetylmannosamine which inhibited the specific antibodies only marginally.
TI  - Gram-negative bacillary meningitis. New therapy and changing concepts.
AB  - Because the CSF is deficient in opsonic and phagocytic activity, optimal therapy  for meningitis mandates the use of antibiotics that are bactericidal at achievable CSF concentrations. This therapeutic principles is satisfied for the common meningeal pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis) but is not readily achieved for the pathogens causing Gram-negative bacillary meningitis (GNBM), such as Klebsiella and Escherichia coli. The antibiotics used to treat GNBM, chloramphenicol and aminoglycosides, are not bactericidal against enteric pathogens at achievable CSF levels. Two new beta-lactam antibiotics, moxalactam disodium and cefotaxime sodium, are suitable agents for the treatment of GNBM. These antibiotics possess potent bactericidal activity against most enteric pathogens and achieve high levels in the CSF (15 to 35 micrograms/mL for moxalactam disodium and 2 to 10 micrograms/mL for cefotaxime sodium). Recent clinical studies document an 85% cure rate when these agents are used to treat GNBM.
TI  - Rapid differentiation of bacterial meningitides by direct gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - Rapid identification of Haemophilus influenzae and other bacillary meningitides was attempted by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) of the metabolic by-products in broth cultures and in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples obtained from experimental meningitis produced in New Zealand White male rabbits. These results were correlated with the GLC of CSF of meningitis patients. A major peak with retention time of succinic acid was found in the broth cultures of all bacilli tested including H. influenzae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Listeria monocytogenes. Succinic acid was also found in the CSF of experimental meningitis and in the CSF of all patients with H. influenzae and Esch. coli meningitis. This peak was not detected in the blood samples of experimental animals. It was also absent in the broth cultures of all of the gram-positive and gram-negative cocci tested, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. Succinic acid, which appears to be a by product of fermentation, persisted as a clear cut marker in H. influenzae meningitis for at least 3 d after the initiation of treatment. In one patient, the succinic acid peak disappeared during treatment and reappeared with a clinical relapse. Clearly, the presence of succinic acid that can be rapidly detected by GLC in the CSF excludes pneumococcal or meningococcal meningitis and strongly suggests H. influenzae or other bacillary meningitides.
TI  - Induction of immunity against lethal Haemophilus influenzae type b infection by Escherichia coli core lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - Efforts to prevent Haemophilus influenzae type b (HIB) infections in infancy have been hampered by the low immunogenicity of capsular polysaccharide vaccines in children younger than 18 mos. In searching for alternate immunogens, we have studied the protective potential of polysaccharide-poor, lipid-rich endotoxin (LPS) core in experimental HIB infections. Because all gram-negative bacteria have similar LPS core structures, we were able to use as vaccine the J5 mutant of Escherichia coli 0111, the LPS of which consists only of core components, and thus to avoid problems in interpretation arising from vaccine contamination with non-LPS HIB immunogens. Mice were given graded inocula of HIB and developed lethal infection analogous to human HIB disease when virulence was enhanced with mucin and hemoglobin. After active immunization with heat-killed E. coli J5, 40/50 (80%) of infected mice survived, compared with 14/50 (28%) of saline-immunized controls (P less than 0.005). Passive immunization with rabbit antiserum against E. coli J5 prevented lethal HIB infection when administered 24 or 72 h before or 3 h after infection. This protection was abolished by adsorption of antiserum with purified J5 LPS, with survival reduced from 14/24 to 0/24 (P less than 0.005). Furthermore, rabbit antiserum to purified J5 LPS gave just as potent protection against death as antiserum to whole J5 cells. These studies demonstrate that immunity to core LPS confers protection against experimental murine HIB infection and provide the framework for a new approach to prevention of human disease from HIB.
TI  - Transfer of the gonococcal penicillinase plasmid: mobilization in Escherichia coli by IncP plasmids and isolation as a DNA-protein relaxation complex.
AB  - A 4.4-megadalton penicillinase plasmid, pWD2, from Neisseria gonorrhoeae was transformed into Escherichia coli. pWD2 was efficiently mobilized by IncP plasmids in E. coli but not by Flac, R1drd-19, or R64drd-11. pWD2 could be isolated as a DNA-protein relaxation complex with properties similar to the well characterized ColE1 complex. The host range of pWD2 was shown to include gonococci, Enterobacteriaceae, and Hemophilus influenzae, but not Acinetobacter calcoaceticus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These findings suggest that P-group plasmids could have played a role in the dissemination of the TEM beta-lactamase to pathogenic gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Cross-reactivity with Escherichia coli K100 in the human serum anticapsular antibody response to Haemophilus influenzae type B.
AB  - Escherichia coli K100 is known to induce antibodies cross-reactive with the capsular polysaccharide (CP) of Haemophilus influenzae b (Hib); the cross-immunogenicity is found consistently in a number of mammalian species including man. We have studied the reciprocal cross-immunogenicity of Hib or its purified CP in man. Of 25 adults and 13 children responding to systemic immunization with Hib CP, only four and four, respectively, made K100 CP cross-reactive antibody, determined by radioantigen-binding inhibition. The detection of preimmunization cross-reactive antibody was not statistically predictive of induction of postimmunization cross-reactive antibody. Cross-reactive antibody was detected in only one of 11 children making an anticapsular response to Hib systemic infection and two of four children responding to asymptomatic nasopharyngeal colonization. In contrast, cross-reactivity was detected in the naturally occurring anti-Hib-CP antibody of 27 of 42 children. Thus, humans responding to Hib or its CP often do not make antibody to the K100-cross-reactive determinant(s), implying that the cross-reactive natural antibodies frequently seen in children must have a stimulus other than Hib.
TI  - Efficacy of ceftriaxone in serious bacterial infections.
AB  - Ceftriaxone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with broad-spectrum in vitro activity and an unusually long serum half-life. The clinical efficacy of ceftriaxone was evaluated in 35 infections in 34 patients; 12 of these patients had skin and soft tissue infections, 10 had infections of the urinary tract, 8 had pneumonia, 2 had biliary tract infections, 1 had sinusitis, 1 had diverticulitis, and 1 had a retroperitoneal abscess. Of the 35 infections, 9 were bacteremic. The bacteria isolated included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, other streptococcal species, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides species, and anaerobic cocci. Improvement or cure occurred in 32 episodes, for a response rate of 91%. There were three treatment failures in patients with soft tissue infections. No serious drug toxicities were observed. At a dosage regimen of 1 g every 12 h the peak and trough serum antibiotic concentrations were well above the minimal inhibitory concentrations of most pathogens. Our findings suggest that ceftriaxone is a safe and effective antibiotic for therapy of serious bacterial infections.
TI  - Mobilization of nonconjugative antibiotic resistance plasmids in Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - A clinical isolate of Haemophilus ducreyi was found to harbor three plasmids: a 23.5-megadalton (Mdal) phenotypically cryptic plasmid, a 7.0-Mdal ampicillin resistance plasmid, and a 4.0-Mdal sulfonamide resistance plasmid. The two smaller plasmids were transferable by conjugation to Haemophilus recipients, but only if the donor cell harbored the 23.5-Mdal plasmid as well, indicating that this large plasmid had mobilizing capabilities. Transfer was also possible to Escherichia coli recipients. Haemophilus influenzae transconjugants which had acquired both the 23.5-Mdal plasmid and one of the R-plasmids could subsequently retransfer the R-plasmid to other Haemophilus recipients at higher frequencies. A derivative of the 23.5 Mdal plasmid was isolated which was shown by restriction endonuclease analysis to contain an ampicillin resistance transposon and to have retained its conjugative ability.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin against gram-positive  and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic species and its beta-lactamase stability.
AB  - The in vitro activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin was determined against 800 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and compared with the activity of cefoxitin, cefazolin, cefamandole, cefotaxime, moxalactam, ampicillin, cefoperazone, and gentamicin. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin inhibited the majority of organisms at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml. It inhibited methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus faecalis. It inhibited beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Unlike other new beta-lactams, it inhibited Listeria. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacters, Serratia, indole-positive Proteus, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacteroides resistant to other agents were inhibited. There was minimal effect of inoculum size and aerobic versus anaerobic conditions, and serum had no effect on activity. Most minimal bactericidal concentrations were two- or fourfold greater than the minimal inhibitory concentration. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin showed partial synergy with aminoglycosides against S. aureus, S. faecalis, and many Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae. It was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated and chromosomal beta-lactamases.
TI  - [Salmonella meningitis].
AB  - Cultures were done for 14.838 cerebro spinal fluid specimens (CSF) during 1977-1980. Positive results were obtained from 950 specimens. These were identified as 352 Klebsiella-Enterobacter (37.0%), 133 Pseudomonas (14.%), 96 Salmonella (10.1%), 65 Pneumococcus (6,9%), 51 Escherichia coli 5,4%), 50 Meningococcus (.3%), Haemophilus influenzae type B (1.0%) and 127 various miscellaneous bacteria. During the same period of time, total of Salmonella isolations from various sources were 865. These specimens were 488 stool (57.0%), 160 blood (18.6% 7) 96 CSF (11.2%) so forth. The majority of these Salmonella strains were of typhimurium serotype carrying a known antibiotic resistence plasmid. This plasmid, belonging to the fime compatibility group, present in the Salmonella typhimurium strains isolated in Middle-East countries like Iran, Israel and others, conferred resistance to the carrying strain against antibiotics like ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulphamide and tetracycline. As started to show up in Ankara too, addition of trimethoprim and gentamicin resistences to this markers were reported. These bacteria were also causing epidemics in pediatric wards of some South America countries which develops with hing rate of bacteremia and meningitis complications as it is in our hospital.
TI  - Augmentin: laboratory studies.
AB  - Clavulanic acid is a beta-lactam antibiotic which, although it has little intrinsic activity, is a potent inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases. When combined with amoxycillin its range of activity includes penicillinase-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus and many of the beta-lactamase-producing strains of Gram-negative bacilli. Bacteria sensitive to augmentin include amoxycillin-resistant strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli, in addition strains of Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Bacteroides fragilis are usually sensitive. The beta-lactamases produced by Enterobacter spp, Proteus morgani, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are less susceptible to clavulanic acid and these bacteria are usually resistant to augmentin (1).
TI  - Clinical efficacy of cefotaxime in serious infections.
AB  - Thirty-five patients underwent 38 treatment courses with cefotaxime. Documented infections included 11 bacteremias, 7 cases of nosocomial pneumonia, 6 surgical wound infections, 3 bone infections, 1 biliary infection, and 1 urinary tract infection. Granulocytopenic patients with fever received 15 courses of empiric cefotaxime therapy alone; in 8 courses, no definite site of infection or pathogen was isolated. Broad-spectrum antibiotics had been administered to 23 patients before cefotaxime. Thirty-seven bacterial pathogens were isolated from 25 patients. Three such pathogens were resistant to cefotaxime and required alternative therapies. Pathogenic isolates included 13 Serratia marcescens, 12 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 Escherichia coli, 2 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 Providencia stuartii, 1 Enterobacter cloacae, 1 Haemophilus influenzae, 1 Enterococcus, and 1 Staphylococcus aureus. Of the treatment courses, 25 of 38 resulted in a favorable response to cefotaxime, including 9 of 15 in granulocytopenic patients. Superinfection was seen in one patient. The emergence of resistance was documented in another patient. Of 15 patients with multiply resistant pathogens, 12 improved with cefotaxime. Of 12 patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 6 favorably responded. Possible complications of cefotaxime were observed in 14 of 42 treatment courses. Cefotaxime is most useful in treatment of infections due to multiply resistant, gram-negative pathogens other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of ceftizoxime in the pediatric infections (author's transl)].
AB  - Ceftizoxime (FK 749, CZX) was evaluated in 24 children with a suspicion of bacterial infection. Of the 17 confirmed bacterial infections, 16 were shown to be effective (effective rate, 94.1%). The diagnosis included acute pharyngitis (2), pneumonia (6), staphylococcal empyema (1), cervical purulent lymphadenitis (2), acute enterocolitis (2), acute pyelonephritis (1), SSSS (1) and suspected septicemia (2). The etiological pathogens recovered were Streptococcus anginosus (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Staphylococcus aureus (2), Haemophilus influenzae (3), enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (1) etc. A case of suspected Pseudomonas aeruginosa septicemia was not effectively treated with CZX. The serum half-life of CZX was 1.36 hours after intravenous bolus infection. A cerebrospinal fluid level of CZX was 6.2 mcg/ml 1 hour after intravenous bolus injection of 1 g (23.8 mg/kg) in a child with inflamed meninges. No severe adverse reaction was encountered with the CZX therapy. The data suggest that CZX is an excellent candidate for the first choice parenteral antibiotic in the pediatric infections.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin in comparison with cefotaxime, lamoxactam, cefoperazone, piperacillin gentamicin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin (MK 0787), a new stable derivative of thienamycin was compared with that of lamoxactam, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, piperacillin and gentamicin against 410 clinical isolates of common bacteria. In comparison with the other agents, MK 0787 was more or equally active against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., and Serratia spp. It inhibited all isolates at a concentration of 0.5 mg/l, but was less active than cefotaxime and lamoxactam against Proteus mirabilis and less active than cefotaxime, lamoxactam and cefoperazone against Beta-lactamase positive Haemophilus influenzae. Strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were more susceptible to N-formimidoyl thienamycin than to other antibiotics.
TI  - Distribution of IS5 in bacteria.
AB  - Four different strains of Escherichia coli and several other bacteria were examined by Southern analysis for the presence of the insertion element IS5 and IS5-like sequences. Variations in the copy number, degree of homology and restriction pattern of the IS5-like sequence were found among the different organisms. The number and distribution of IS5 sequences do not appear to correlate with the evolutionary relationship of the bacteria in which they occur.
TI  - Structural and immunological studies of the Haemophilus influenzae type d capsular polysaccharide.
AB  - Employing a combination of chemical and spectroscopic techniques, the structure of the Haemophilus influenzae type d capsular polysaccharide was found to be leads to 4)-beta-D-GlcNAc-(1 leads to 3)-beta-D-ManNAcA-(1 leads to. L-Alanine, L-serine, and L-threonine, in the molar ratios of approximately 1.0:1.0:0.3, were linked to C-6 of the D-mannosyluronic residue as amides; the (serine + alanine + threonine) to ManNAcA ratio was approximately 0.95:1.0. Removal of the amino acids by mild hydrolysis with sodium hydroxide resulted in a material that was cross-reactive with the native, type d polymer. The base-treated, type d polysaccharide was not observed to cross-react with either the H. influenzae type e or Escherichia coli K7 capsular polysaccharide, both of which are structurally similar to type d.

TI  - [Comparison of antibacterial activity of cefmenoxime with other cephalosporins against clinically isolated bacteria (author's transl)].
AB  - We examined the antibacterial activity of MX in comparison with those of other CEPs, using aerobic Gram-positive cocci, aerobic Gram-negative bacilli and anaerobic bacteria, 870 strains in total, all isolated from clinical specimens, in 1979 and 1980. Against Streptococcus, CMX showed superior antibacterial activity than those of CFX, CMZ, CXM and CTM. Against H. influenzae, CMX also showed superior antibacterial activity than those of CFX, CMX, CXM, CTM and CEZ. ABPC-and PIPC-resistant strains were sensitive to CMX. CTX, CPZ and CZX also showed antibacterial activities equivalent to that of CMX. Against enteric bacteria, E. coli, Klebsiella, E. cloacae, Serratia, C. freundii and Proteus, CMX showed superior antibacterial activity than those of CFX, CMZ, CXM, CTM and CEZ. Especially, against E. coli, Klebsiella, P. mirabilis, P. rettgeri and P. inconstans, CMX showed strong antibacterial activity. As to non-fermentation bacteria, CMX's antibacterial activity was relatively weak except P. putrefaciens, Alcaligenes and Comamonas. However, it was superior than that of CEZ. In comparison with other CEPs, the strength of CMX varied according to the kinds of bacteria. As to anaerobic bacteria, CMX showed strong antibacterial activity against Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Lactobacillus, Propionibacterium, C. perfringens, Veillonella and Fusobacterium. However, its antibacterial activity against Bacteroides was similar to those of other CEPs.
TI  - Otitis media in children.
AB  - Acute otitis media is one of the commonest diseases of childhood. Most cases are  due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and can be treated safely with penicillin. However, Hemophilus influenzae is also common, particularly under the age of five. In many areas it is increasingly resistant to ampicillin and should be treated with a trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole preparation (Bactrim, Septra). The new agent, cefaclor (Ceclor) may prove to be a valid alternative. In the first few months of life, special problems include difficulty in recognition, a greater frequency of atypical organisms including Escherichia coli, and associated serious systemic illnesses. Recurrent suppurative otitis media (three or more episodes of acute otitis media in a six month period) is an indication for prophylactic antimicrobial therapy.The most common complication of acute otitis media is persistence of effusion. Risk factors include resistance of the organism(s) to the initial antimicrobial agent and the presence of coexisting allergy. Tympanostomy tubes and adenoidectomy should be considered in selected cases. A key to successful treatment is careful follow up after each episode to assure the restoration of normal hearing.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of ceftazidime compared with that of other cephalosporins.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of ceftazidime was compared with the activities of cefoperazone, cefotaxime, cefsulodin, cefuroxime, cephalothin and cefatriaxon against 331 clinical bacterial isolates. Against Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Enterobacter, Proteus mirabilis and indole-positive Proteus ceftazidime, with MIC90 of < or = 0.25 mg/l, was more active than cephalothin, cefoperazone and cefuroxime but less active than cefotaxime and ceftriaxone Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia, Acinetobacter and Citrobacter were inhibited at higher concentrations (MIC90 1-4 mg/l). The activity of ceftazidime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MIC90 of 4 mg/l) was four times that of cefoperazone, five times that of cefatriaxon and ten times that of cefotaxime, but similar to that of cefsulodin. Against Staphylococcus aureus and Lancefield groups A and B streptococci ceftazidime was less active than the other cephalosporins. Group D streptococci were resistant. Haemophilus influenzae was inhibited by < or = 0.25 mg/l. There were no significant inoculum effects on ceftazidime and MBCs were within one twofold dilution of MICs. The addition of 50% human serum had no effect on MICs and MBCs.
TI  - Transferable multiple antibiotic resistance in Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  
TI  - 6 beta-Iodopenicillanic acid (UI-38,006), a beta-lactamase inhibitor that extends the antibacterial spectrum of beta-lactam compounds: initial bacteriological characterization.
AB  - UK-38,006, 6 beta-iodopenicillanic acid, was shown to be a potent inhibitor of beta-lactamase enzymes. It potentiated the antibacterial action of ampicillin in vitro against beta-lactamase-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Bacteroides fragilis. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and many Enterobacteriaceae. This ability to synergize with ampicillin was also demonstrated in vivo after oral administration of UK-38,006 to experimentally infected mice. UK-38,006 was also shown to synergize in vitro with other penicillins and cephalosporins against beta-lactamase-producing strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella species.
TI  - Origin of Haemophilus influenzae R factors.
AB  - The Haemophilus influenzae R plasmids specifying resistance against one, two, or  three antibiotics which have emerged in different parts of the world were shown to have closely related but not identical plasmid cores. The gene for ampicillin resistance in the H. influenzae plasmid pKRE5367 is part of a transposon similar to Tn3, which was transposed from pKRE5367 onto RSF1010 in Escherichia coli. An indigenous H. influenzae plasmid (pW266) was isolated. Its properties correspond to those of the H. influenzae R plasmids, except for the presence of a drug resistance transposon. The in vitro-generated H. influenzae R plasmids carrying an ampicillin resistance transposon, a tetracycline resistance transposon, and a transposon for combined tetracycline-chloramphenicol resistance resembled the natural isolates. The findings support the hypothesis that the R plasmids of H. influenzae are of multiclonal evolutionary origin.
TI  - Intraspecific and intergeneric mobilization of non-conjugative resistance plasmids by a 24.5 megadalton conjugative plasmid of Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  - pLE2451, a 24.5 megadalton conjugative plasmid from Neisseria gonorrhoeae, was capable of efficiently mobilizing gonococcal beta-lactamase plasmids between gonococci and from gonococci to Haemophilus influenzae and restriction-deficient Escherichia coli. Donor strains of N. gonorrhoeae carrying pLE2451 were also found to be capable of mobilizing a variety of non-conjugative plasmids originally derived from enteric bacteria or Haemophilus species when such plasmids were resident in E. coli. Nevertheless, pLE2451 was not detected physically in E. coli or H. influenzae transconjugants. This suggests that the plasmid is unstable in these hosts but survives transiently to provide transfer functions for mobilization. The proficiency of pLE2451 in promoting intraspecific and intergeneric mobilization was not paralleled by pUB701, pRI234 and pFR16017, a series of conjugative plasmids derived originally from Haemophilus species. These plasmids were incapable of mobilizing even Haemophilus beta-lactamase plasmids, such as RSF0885, between Haemophilus species.
TI  - Polymyxin B inactivation of lipopolysaccharide in vaccines of Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Endotoxin activity in suspensions of Bordetella pertussis, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was often markedly decreased by polymyxin B. Polymyxin B treatment may be a means to reduce inflammatory reactivity of lipopolysaccharide in vaccines of gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Haemophilus influenzae disease in Alaskan Eskimos: characteristics of a population with an unusual incidence of invasive disease.
AB  - During 1971-77 the incidence of bacterial meningitis among Alaskan Eskimos was 84.4 cases per 100 000 population per year, which is more than 10 times that for most other U.S. populations. Haemophilus influenzae (HI) accounted for 68% of meningitis cases. The average annual incidence of HI disease per 100 000 children below 5 years of age was 409 for patients with meningitis only and 491 for patients with all systemic HI disease. Children with HI meningitis in Alaska tended to be younger than those in other U.S. populations, 98% of the children affected being less than 18 months of age. The risk for all HI disease was 2.4% during the first year of life. The spectrum of HI disease in Alaska differs from that in other populations in that no patient had epiglottitis and 5% of children had recurrent HI disease. Alaskan newborns and children over 4 years old had HI anticapsular antibody titres that were nearly thrice those for children of similar ages in other U.S. populations (p less than 0.005). The pharyngeal carriage of HI type b (5%) and the rectal carriage of Escherichia coli K100 (2%), an organism with a capsule antigenically similar to HI type b, did not differ from those in other populations. The high incidence of disease almost exclusively in the very young and the early development of antibody in this population suggest that the high rate of disease is due to early exposure to HI type b rather than to an unusual susceptibility to HI type b.
TI  - New method that uses binding of immunoglobulin A to group A streptococcal immunoglobulin A Fc receptors for demonstration of microbial immunoglobulin A protease activity.
AB  - A new method is described for the detection of bacterial immunoglobulin A (IgA) protease which splits IgA into Fab and Fc fragments. The method takes advantage of a recent finding that receptors for IgA fragments occur commonly among type 4 group A streptococci. The bacterial preparation to be tested for protease activity was first incubated with radiolabeled purified IgA1 myeloma protein, and the proportion of radioactivity bound to a standard suspension of the streptococci was then measured. Since isolated Fab fragments do not bind to streptococcal IgA receptors, a decrease in the amount of radioactivity bound to the streptococci, as compared with the amount before digestion, indicates the presence of protease in the test preparation. Using this method, protease activity was detected in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus sanguis, but not in Escherichia coli or Branhamella catarrhalis.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefotiam therapy in children (author's transl)].
AB  - Cefotiam (CTM) was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in children. Twenty-six  patients were treated with 40 to 200 mg/kg per day of CTM by intravenous administrations. The diagnosis of the patients were acute pharyngitis (2), acute bronchitis (1), pneumonia (4), empyema (2), urinary tract infection (2), typhoid fever (1), acute enterocolitis (2), partially-treated purulent meningitis (1), and suspected septicemia in neuroblastoma (1); and the remaining ten patients were considered to have nonbacterial infections. The pathogens recovered were Streptococcus pyogenes (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Staphylococcus aureus (4), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Escherichia coli (1), enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (1), Salmonella typhi (1), and Campylobacter jejuni (1). All but two patients of bacterial infections were cured after the CTM therapy, and the rate of efficacy was 87.5%. Diarrhea (3), urticaria (1), transient elevation of GOT and GPT (1), and transient eosinophilia (3) were found to be associated with the CTM therapy. However, no severe adverse reactions were encountered. Half life of the serum CTM level was 0.93 +/- 0.13 hours, and excretion into the urine was rapid. CSF concentration obtained 1 hour after an intravenous injection of 21 mg/kg of CTM in a case with inflamed meninges was 1.5 mcg/ml, and the CSF/serum ratio was 9.0%. From these data, CTM appears to be a safe and effective antibiotic when used in children with susceptible bacterial infections.

TI  - Interaction of haemocin with Escherichia coli.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of haemocin, a bacteriocin produced by Haemophilus influenzae b, for Escherichia coli CR34 could be blocked by the addition of 2,4-dinitrophenol. No inhibition by 2,4-dinitrophenol of the haemocin activity on H. influenzae Rd strain C25 was demonstrated. The data suggest an energy-dependent step in the mode of action of haemocin on strain CR34.
TI  - Penicillin-binding proteins in Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of Haemophilus influenzae were studied by  sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Eight major PBPs, ranging in molecular weights from 90,000 to 27,000, were detected. The pattern of molecular weights was different from that determined fro Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A study on the binding of several beta-lactam antibodies to the PBPs at their minimal inhibitory concentrations and at lower and higher concentrations revealed that all had highest affinity for PBP 2. Amdinocillin (mecillinam) was an exception; it had highest affinity for PBP 3. The morphological effects of several penicillins, cephalosporins, and amdinocillin on H. influenzae were similar to those reported for E. coli.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on cefoxitin in pediatric field (author's transl)].
AB  - Studies on antimicrobial activity, absorption and excretion and clinical use of cefoxitin in pediatric field were performed. 1. MIC of cefoxitin was compared with that of cefazolin and/or ampicillin for clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (36 strains), Escherichia coli (35 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (34 strains) and Haemophilus influenzae (80 strains). MIC of cefoxitin against S. aureus was approximately 1-2 tubes higher than that of cefazolin. Many strains of E. coli and K. pneumoniae that showed high MIC to cefazolin were sensitive to cefoxitin. It is presumed that the results are due to the strong resistance of cefoxitin to beta-lactamase degradation. MIC of cefoxitin against H. influenzae was approximately 1-2 tubes lower than that of cefazolin, but approximately 4 tubes higher than that of ampicillin. 2. Serum level and urinary recovery rate of cefoxitin after one shot i.v. injection of 25 mg/kg were examined. The serum mean levels were 33.8 microgram/ml at 1/2 hour, 7.0 microgram/ml at 1 hour and 2.9 microgram/ml at 2 hours after the injection, respectively, and the drug was not detected in serum at 4 and 6 hours after the injection. The mean half-life of serum level was 27.1 minutes. The mean urinary recovery rate within 6 hours after injection was 96.0% and most of the drug were excreted into urine within 2 hours after the injection. 3. In order to evaluate clinical response, bacteriological response and side effects, cefoxitin was applied to 19 cases, i.e., 12 cases of either acute lobar pneumonia or acute bronchopneumonia, 2 cases of acute pyelitis, 1 case each of acute bronchitis, acute purulent tonsillitis, acute purulent arthritis, acute orbital phlegmon and acute buccal abscess. As for clinical response, the overall efficacy rate (the percentage of cases showed excellent and good efficacy) was 88.9%. As for bacteriological response, among the 13 strains which were determined or supposed to be causative organisms, i.e., 6 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of H. influenzae and 1 strain each of streptococcus pyogenes, alpha-Streptococcus, Enterococcus, E. coli and Neisseria sp., all strains were disappeared except for Enterococcus which was reduced by the treatment with cefoxitin. No side effect was observed in any case. Abnormalities of laboratory findings were observed in 3 cases, i.e., 1 case each of reduction of RBC and Hb, elevation of GOT and GPT and elevation of GPT, but all of them returned to normal following completion of the dosage term.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefoxitin in children (author's transl)].
AB  - Cefoxitin (CFX) was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in children. Fifteen patients were treated with 73-125 mg/kg per day of CFX by intravenous administrations. The diagnosis of the patients were acute pharyngitis (4), pneumonia (2), pertussis and pneumonia (1), urinary tract infection (3); and the remaining 5 patients were esteemed to have nonbacterial infections. All the 10 patients of bacterial infections were cured after the CFX therapy. The pathogens recovered were Streptococcus pyogenes (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (3), Haemophilus influenzae (2), Escherichia coli (2), enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (1), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1). All the strains isolated were susceptible to CFX, but the 2 isolates of Haemophilus influenzae had relatively high MIC values (12.5 mcg/ml). Diarrhea (3 cases) and transient neutropenia (1 case) were found to be associated with the CFX therapy. However, no severe adverse reactions were encountered. Half-life of the serum level was short (24.1 minutes) and excretion into the urine was rapid. CSF concentration obtained 30 minutes after an intravenous injection of 50 mg/kg of CFX in 1 case with inflamed meninges was considerably high (8.3 mcg/ml). CFX appears to be a safe and effective antibiotic when used in children with susceptible bacterial infections.
TI  - [Quantitative bacterial ecology of normal nasal mucosa].
AB  - A quantitative research into the aerobic bacteria of human nasal cavities has been carried out; 183 healthy individuals observed, negative results 18 (9.83%). Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria, were numerically determined and the incidence of each single species or genus exactly specified. Among gram-negative bacteria, Enterobacter, Providencia, Proteus, Citrobacter freundii, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Serratia, Herella, Pseudomonas, and among the Hyphomycetes, Candida albicans have been identified and their number calculated. Diphteroid bacteria were also detected and counted; among them, the Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum seemed to be the most frequent and numerous species. Finally, interference phenomena in vivo by Staphylococcus aureus and environmental and nourishment competition by Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus and Diphtheroids were noted.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365).
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365 or A-50912), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic, was compared with those of cefazolin, cefoxitin, and cefamandole against a broad spectrum of 486 organisms and with that of cefotaxime against 114 organisms. Cefmenoxime and cefotaxime exhibited nearly equivalent activities against those organisms tested and were the most active of these cephalosporins against all aerobic and facultative organisms except Staphylococcus aureus. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefmenoxime required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (MIC(90)) ranged from 0.06 to 8 mug/ml for the Enterobacteriaceae. The MIC(90)s for gram-positive cocci were 0.015 and </=0.008 mug/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, respectively, and 2 mug/ml for S. aureus. Group D streptococci were less susceptible. Cefmenoxime was very active against Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Neisseria meningitidis with MIC(90)s ranging from </=0.008 to 0.25 mug/ml. Cefmenoxime, at a concentration of 16 mug/ml, inhibited 78% and 73% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp., respectively. MICs for anaerobes ranged from 0.5 to >128 mug/ml with good activity against the gram-positive organisms. In addition, cefmenoxime activity was bactericidal and only slightly affected by differences in inoculum size. The combination of cefmenoxime and gentamicin was synergistic against 80% of the Enterobacteriaceae and 100% of P. aeruginosa strains tested. Development of resistance to cefmenoxime was slow or absent for organisms with low initial MICs but more rapid for those with higher initial MICs. Cefmenoxime exhibited good protective activity in mice infected with Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, or S. aureus but was less effective against P. aeruginosa.

AB  - Cefotaxime concentrations obtained in the C.S.F. of twelve children suffering from bacterial meningitis and undergoing monotherapy with this antibiotic are reported. Among these 12 patients, 4 infants (aged 3 to 28 days) had neonatal meningitis (due to Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli); one infant (2 months old) had meningitis due to Salmonella panama; 5 children (aged 5 to 11 months) had meningitis due to Haemophilus; and 2 children had belated superinfection caused by a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt due to Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefotaxime concentration reached a high level as early as one hour after the injection (3 to 19 mcg/ml), remained at this level until the fifth hour (1,8 to 14,3 mcg/ml) and decreased without significant proportionality with the disappearance of the inflammatory symptoms. Compared to the M.I.C. of the bacteria which caused the twelve cases of meningitis, these results show that the concentrations in the C.S.F. are much higher than the M.I.C.'s. These results are comparable to those of previous studies. Cefotaxime diffuses in the C.S.F. and gives concentrations which ensures an antibacterial activity that ampicillin could not reach: in particular against Haemophilus influenzae and enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - [Some investigations on cefadroxil dry syrup (author's transl)].
AB  - MIC of cefadroxil (CDX) against A group beta-Streptococcus was distributed between 0.05-0.2 microgram/ml, that is, more susceptible than cephalexin (CEX) an cefaclor (CCL), and susceptible to tetracycline (TC), erythromycin (EM), lincomycin (LCM) resistant strains. Serum level was higher than CCL administered orally at the same dose, and urinary excretion ratio after oral administration was good similarly to CEX and CCL. Patients treated were mostly scarlet fever and upper respiratory tract infections as acute tonsillitis and lacunar tonsillitis. They responded well to CDX at a daily dose of 30 mg/kg divided into 3-4 times. All cases of scarlet fever became normal temperature within 2 days. Among 14 cases in which A group beta-hemolytic Streptococcus was detected by pharyngeal sputum culture at admission, 11 cases became negative on the 1st day. This result was superior to CEX, when this drug was administered orally at a daily dose of 40-60 mg/kg, bacteria became negative at the ratio of 73.3% on the 2nd day. CDX was effective for acute tonsillitis, lacunar tonsillitis, acute bronchitis, impetigo and maxillary lymphadenitis in which numerous A group beta-Streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae were proven, as well as for acute urinary tract infection due to Escherichia coli. Clinical results of CDX in totalling 69 cases were excellent in 63 cases, good in 6 cases, efficacy ratio being 100%. No local nor systemic side effects were observed in 69 cases including maximum 11 days' treatment, as well as no effect was noticed on hepatic and renal functions. From the above results, it was concluded that satisfactory treatment results may be obtained with CDX dry syrup for children at a daily dose of 20-50 mg/kg divided into 3-4 times in acute infections due to CDX susceptible pathogens.
TI  - [Osteoarticular infections due to Gram-negative bacilli].
AB  - An enquiry carried out on 20 French rheumatology units led us to find, out of a total of 1,202 cases of non-tuberculous osteo-arthritis of the adult, 137 gram negative bacillary infections. These were 64 cases of spondylodiscitis and 73 cases of septic arthritis, due mainly to Escherichia Coli, Pseudomonas and other enterobacteria. The frequency of gram-negative bacilli was 11.4% i.e. 9.2% in the case of arthritis and 15.6% in the case of spondylodiscitis. It is higher than in the middle of this century but does not seem to be progressing now. However, the seventy of this type of infection, which may cause important functional sequelae and numerous deaths (8 patients) justifies the routine search for these bacilli in appropriate culture media, in order to test their sensitivity to antibiotics.
TI  - Mutation induction in Haemophilus influenzae by ICR-191. II. Role of DNA replication and repair.
AB  - Evidence is presented to show that presumptive frameshift mutations induced in Haemophilus influenzae by ICR-191 are fixed very rapidly, essentially at the time of treatment. DNA synthesis during treatment is essential for fixation, but DNA synthesis after treatment has no effect. The conclusion is drawn that the mutagen acts at the replication fork, possibly to stabilize misannealings arising in association with the discontinuities in the newly synthesized DNA. These results agree with earlier results on Escherichia coli showing that ICR-191 produces peak mutation frequencies in synchronized cultures at times when the replication fork has reached the locus being studied. They are in sharp contrast to the earlier results in H. influenzae with nitroso compounds and hydrazine that suggest these agents produce randomly distributed, reparable pre-mutational damage that still can be fixed (converted to final mutation) for some time after treatment when the replication fork reaches them. No evidence for such persistent pre-mutational lesions was found with ICR-191. A defect in incision appeared to have very little influence on mutation induction by ICR-191 though it caused much more lethality. The interpretation of the mutation data was made somewhat uncertain, however, by an unexplained plating-density effect on the expression of the mutants in this strain. In contrast, incision deficiencies in E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium have been reported to cause a large increase in mutation induction and to allow lesions at some distance from the replication fork to produce mutations.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of fluorinated analogs of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol.
AB  - We evaluated the in vitro antimicrobial activity of Sch 24893, Sch 25298, and Sch 25393, three novel analogs of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol. All of the analogs had minimal inhibitory concentrations of less than or equal to 10 micrograms/ml for 18 chloramphenicol-thiamphenicol-resistant strains of Shigella dysenteriae and 21 strains of resistant Salmonella typhi. The analogs were also more active than were chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol against chloramphenicol-resistant enteric bacteria, including six strains of Escherichia coli, seven strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and two strains of Enterobacter cloacae. Fifty-three strains of ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae were uniformly susceptible to chloramphenicol, thiamphenicol, and the three analogs. Sch 25298 was the most active compound tested (minimal inhibitory concentration, 0.5 microgram/ml for all strains). Four of seven chloramphenicol-thiamphenicol-resistant Haemophilus strains were susceptible to the fluorinated analogs. Of the three Haemophilus strains which were resistant to chloramphenicol, thiamphenicol, and the analogs, two contained less than 10% of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity of the strains which were resistant to only chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol. We conclude that fluorinated analogs of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol have considerable in vitro activity against a broad spectrum of chloramphenicol-thiamphenicol-resistant, gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Evaluation of cefaclor.
AB  - The chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, bacterial spectrum, clinical use,  dosage, adverse reactions, and dosage forms and cost of cefaclor are reviewed. Cefaclor, a congener of cephalexin monohydrate, is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic. It is well absorbed when given orally on an empty stomach; absorption is delayed by the presence of food. Although metabolism may play a role in the disposition of cefaclor, elimination is primarily renal. Cefaclor's spectrum of activity is similar to that of cefalexin, including a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria; in particular, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., and Haemophilus influenzae are more susceptible to clinically achievable concentrations of cefaclor than cephalexin. Cefaclor has been demonstrated to be effective against beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae resistant to ampicillin, but further studies are needed to establish the clinical significance of this activity. Efficacy of cefaclor has been demonstrated in urinary tract, upper and lower respiratory tract, and skin and soft tissue infections in adults and children as well as in pediatric otitis media. Adverse reactions, mostly gastrointestinal, are generally mild and occur in few patients. Usual doses are 250-500 mg every eight hours in adults and 20--40 mg/kg/day in children, although this pediatric dose may be two low for otitis media. Clinical superiority of cefaclor over less expensive antibiotics has not been demonstrated.
TI  - A radioactive antigen-binding assay for the measurement of antibody to Haemophilus influenzae type b capsular polysaccharide.
AB  - A new polyethylene glycol (PEG) radioimmunoprecipitation assay was developed for  the detection of antibody to Haemophilus influenzae b capsular polysaccharide, polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP). The radioactive antigen, [3H]PRP, with a high specific activity, was produced by growing the organism in the presence of [3H]ribose and was purified by hydroxylapatite and Sepharose 4B column chromatography. In the assay, PEG (12.5%) was used to separate antibody-bound [3H]PRP from free [3H]PRP. The assay covered the range of 0.5 and 20 ng antibody/assay at a maximum sensitivity of 0.5 approximately 1.0 ng antibody/assay. With various dilutions (1-20 ng antibody/assay) of S. Klein reference antiserum, the within-run coefficient of variation (CV) of 10 replicates ranged from 3.5 to 8.5%. Average CVs of 8.9% and 11.0% were obtained in the between-run and day-to-day reproducibility studies. The binding of [3H]PRP to S. Klein reference antiserum was severely inhibited by a minute amount of non-radioactive PRP; however, no significant interference was found in the presence of high concentrations of polysaccharides from Escherichia coli K100 and Streptococcus pneumoniae indicating that the RIA was highly specific for antibody to H. influenzae b PRP. The present RIA is a simple, specific, sensitive and reproducible procedure for the evaluation of antibody responses of young animals and infants to H. influenzae b vaccines and infections.
TI  - A comparison of cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and cefoperazone:  an in vitro test on a number of beta-lactamase producing strains of 9 species and 1 genus of bacteria.
AB  - The sensitivity of a number of beta-lactamase producing strains of Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter species, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens to cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and cefoperazone was determined in vitro. All bacterial cultures were examined for beta-lactamase production using the chromogenic cephalosporin compound 87/312. All strains were typed by means of antibiotic and chemotherapeutic sensitivities. Only non-identical strains were used. A tray method was used to determine the quantity of antimicrobial product necessary for a complete growth inhibition at various culture dilutions. The results showed that all strains of H. influenzae, especially in the dilution 2.10(6), were sensitive to the five cephalosporins. The other species and genus of bacteria had a varying sensitivity to the five cephalosporins. Cefoperazone had potent activity against Ps. aeruginosa. Differences between the five cephalosporins with regard to the effect of culture dilution were only small.
TI  - Cefmenoxime (SCE-1365), a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin: in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities.
AB  - The activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365), 7 beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-(Z)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1H-tetraz ol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, was compared with that of other cephalosporins. Cefmenoxime exhibited high activity against a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime against Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive Proteus, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citrobacter freundii, was 10 to 1,000 times greater than that of several other cephalosporins. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, cefmenoxime showed activity two to four times that of sulbenicillin and carbenicillin but less than that of cefsulodin. Variation in pH, addition of horse serum, and type of growth medium had definite effects on the activity of cefmenoxime, and the inoculum size affected the activity against bacterial species. In Escherichia coli cefmenoxime showed marked affinity for penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP-3), followed by PBP-1 (1A and 1B). This affinity profile was well correlated with its filamentous cell-forming activity under extremely low drug concentrations and with its bactericidal activity against microorganisms. The high in vitro activity of cefmenoxime was reflected in the degree of protection observed in mice infected intraperitoneally with a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, cefmenoxime showed good therapeutic activity against infection models in mice such as respiratory tract infection caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae and urinary tract infection caused by Proteus mirabilis.

TI  - In vitro antagonism by erythromycin of the bactericidal action of antimicrobial agents against common respiratory pathogens.
AB  - Ten strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were tested in vitro against erythromycin combined with ampicillin, cefamandole, or gentamicin. Antagonism by erythromycin occurred with 47% of the combinations involving strains of S. aureus and to a lesser degree with H. influenzae. Synergy occurred most commonly with H. influenzae (27%). The high frequency of antagonism and synergy with these organisms was associated with a broad range of bacteriostatic action by erythromycin against these same bacteria. The implications for the treatment of pneumonia are discussed.

TI  - Phosphonopeptide antibacterial agents related to alafosfalin: design, synthesis,  and structure-activity relationships.
AB  - Dipeptide variants of alafosfalin (L-alanyl-L-1-aminoethylphosphonic acid) with substantial differences in potency and antibacterial spectrum in vitro and in vivo have been synthesized. Certain dipeptides with alternatives to the L-alanyl residue had broader antibacterial spectra; activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was included. Some compounds had better in vivo activity than alafosfalin when introduced into infected rodents orally, but for the majority of the more active phosphonodipeptides, parenteral administration was more effective. Certain oligopeptides derived from the more active phosphonodipeptides possessed good in vitro activity against an extended range of organisms; they included Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The in vivo activity of some of these phosphono-oligopeptides was significantly greater than that of the parent dipeptide and correlated well with the in vitro results. This indicates that phosphono-oligopeptides exert part of their in vivo action directly, in addition to that arising from smaller peptides produced by peptidase cleavage.

TI  - Rapid diagnosis of infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing bacteria by means of an enzyme radioisotopic assay.
AB  - We developed a sensitive enzyme radioisotopic assay for the measurement of beta-lactamase, an enzyme produced by a number of pathogenic bacteria. This ERIA was 100-fold more sensitive than the commonly used iodometric or spectrophotometric assays for the measurement of beta-lactamase and, unlike these other assays, the ERIA was not significantly influenced by serum proteins or unlabeled penicillin. Clinical specimens consisting of blood, peritoneal, pleural, and cerebrospinal fluids from patients infected with beta-lactamase-producing organisms yielded positive ERIA tests; fluids from uninfected patients were negative. The ERIA takes approximately 90 minutes to perform, and offers great potential for the rapid diagnosis of serious bacterial infections caused by bacteria which produce beta-lactamase.
TI  - An eleven-base-pair sequence determines the specificity of DNA uptake in Haemophilus transformation.
AB  - Only certain DNA fragments are taken up efficiently by component Haemophilus cells; this implies that efficient uptake requires the presence of a specific nucleotide sequence on the incoming DNA (Sisco and Smith, 1979). To determine the structure of this "uptake site", we have isolated and sequenced four small fragments of cloned H. parainfluenzae DNA which retain the ability to be taken up by cells. These fragments have a sequence of eleven base pairs in common, 5'-AAGTGCGGTCA-3' and ethylation of certain phosphoryl groups in this sequence causes significant decreases in fragment uptake. We conclude that this is the sequence of the uptake site.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of cerumen.
AB  - Freshly collected cerumen (dry form) suspended at a concentration of 3% in glycerol-sodium bicarbonate buffer showed bactericidal activity against some strains of bacteria tested. This suspension reduced the viability of Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli K-12, and Serratia marcescens by more than 99%, whereas the viability of two Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, E. coli K-1, Streptococcus, and two Staphylococcus aureus isolates of human origin was reduced by 30 to 80%. The results support the hypothesis that cerumen functions to kill certain foreign organisms which enter the ear canal.
TI  - Evaluation of the four-hour Micro-ID technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative, Gram-negative rods from blood cultures.
AB  - A 4-h Micro-ID technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative gram-negative rods from positive blood cultures was compared to subculture and species identification of single colonies by API 20E and Micro-ID, using standardized inocula. A total of 127 patients (220 positive cultures) were studied. Isolates included 96 Escherichia coli, 46 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 Klebsiella oxytoca, 8 Enterobacter aerogenes, 17 Enterobacter cloacae, 19 Serratia marcescens, 2 Serratia liquefaciens, 8 Proteus mirabilis, 1 Salmonella species, 1 Morganella morganii, 6 Haemophilus influenzae, 2 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 3 Bacteroides fragilis, 3 Acinetobacter calcoaceticus biotype anitratus, and 1 Pseudomonas maltophilia. In 90% of the cultures, identification by Micro-ID was identical to that obtained after subculture; if the 15 non-enterobacterial isolates were excluded, the corresponding figure was 96.6%. Enterobacteria identified incorrectly by direct Micro-ID were three S. marcescens (two identified as S. liquefaciens, one as Hafnia alvei), two S. liquefaciens (both identified as E. cloacae), and two K. pneumoniae (one identified as Klebsiella ozaenae, the other as Serratia rubidaea). None of the 15 non-enterobacterial cultures were correctly identified by Micro-ID (non-identifiable, or classified as Providencia/Yersinia/Klebsiella species). Although biochemical discrepancies between direct and final Micro-ID tests occurred in 41% of the enterobacterial cultures, this did not seriously interfere with identification. Direct species identification of Enterobacteriaceae from blood cultures by direct Micro-ID is accurate and easily performed and identified organisms within 4 h compared to at least 24 h by most other methods; the direct Micro-ID technique would be rendered even more valuable by the additional capability of identifying non-enterobacterial gram-negative isolates.
TI  - Latex agglutination test for rapid detection of bacterial antigens in body fluids.
AB  - A modified latex agglutination (LA) test performed on glass slides was evaluated  for the detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pn), Hemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), and K1 antigens in serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), nasopharyngeal secretions, and other body fluids in patients suspected of having infection. Forty-eight, 61, and 31 specimens were tested for the presence of Pn, Hib, and K1 antigens, respectively, by countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) and LA. Of the specimens positive by CIE or LA, 16 of 28 specimens (57 percent) were positive for Pn antigen by CIE while all 16 (100 percent) were positive by LA. LA was unique in detecting type 7 and 14 Pn antigens which are not detected by CIE. Twenty-seven of 37 specimens (73 percent) were positive for Hib by CIE, while all (100 percent) were positive by LA. LA test (11 of 11) was superior (p < 0.002) to CIE (4 of 11) in detecting Hib antigens on patients with nonmeningitic Hib diseases (cellulitis, epiglottitis and pneumonia). Sensitivity of CIE and LA were identical in detecting K1 (5 of 5) antigen. LA is a simple, sensitive and specific test for the detection of Pn, Hib, and K1 antigens in various body fluids.
TI  - Viral and bacterial antibody responses in multiple sclerosis.
AB  - An imprint electroimmunofixation method (IEIF) was used to characterize antibodies to eight viral antigens (measles, mumps, rubella, herpes simplex type 1, varicella-zoster, vaccinia, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus) and four bacterial antigens (beta-hemolytic streptococcus, Hemophilus influenzae type B, Escherichia coli, enterococcus) in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 12 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Twelve patients matched for age and sex sex served as controls. Evidence for intrathecal synthesis of oligoclonal antibodies to one or more antigens was found in all 12 MS patients and in 1 of the controls. In the MS group, antibodies to viruses with neurotropic properties were more frequently associated with local synthesis than antibodies to other viruses and bacteria. The types and number of locally synthesized antibodies showed no correlation with disease duration and severity. The antibodies were not associated with oligoclonal CSF IgG and appear to account for only a minor fraction of the locally synthesized CSF IgG in MS.
TI  - Meningitis caused by gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - Thirty adults with meningitis caused by gram-negative bacilli were observed from  1968 to 1978 at four hospitals associated with Boston University School of Medicine. Equal numbers of two distinct types of gram-negative bacillary meningitis--spontaneously occurring meningitis and meningitis after neurosurgery--were found. Spontaneously occurring meningitis appeared to be caused most often by Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae. Meningitis occurring after neurosurgical procedures was more insidious in onset, more protracted in course, and more often caused by organisms resistant to multilple antibiotics. Approaches to therapy are based on the differences in character of these two types of meningitis.
TI  - Further studies on the induction of mutation in Haemophilus influenzae by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine: lack of an inducible error-free repair system and the effect of exposure medium.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae is shown to lack the inducible, error-free repair system for alkylation damage that others have found in Escherichia coli. Prior growth in a low concentration of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine had only an additive effect on a subsequent brief exposure to a high concentration. Furthermore, chloramphenicol did not significantly modify the mutagenic response. In both respects, H. influenzae differs from E. coli. Experiments carried out in preparation for these tests showed that exposure to N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine in complex growth medium was more effective by about an order of magnitude than exposure in pH 6.0 tris--maelare buffer in inducing mutations, in killing the cells, and in causing strand breaks in the preexisting DNA and gaps in newly synthesized DNA. Thus the effect of the medium is on the amount of initial damage rather than on some special feature of the mutation process. Part but not all of the effect can be accounted for by the difference in pH of the 2 media. The nature of the mutagenic process is the same under the 2 exposure conditions; i.e., reparable pre-mutational damage is produced by the agent and subsequently converted to final mutation by replication. The dose--effect curves have a non-linear initial portion under both exposure conditions, and possible reasons for this non-linearity are discussed.
TI  - Acute nongonococcal infectious arthritis. Evaluation of risk factors, therapy, and outcome.
AB  - A retrospective analysis of 71 nongonococcal joint infections in 63 patients is reported. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 59% of the patients. Five patients died as a result of infections. The outcome in Gram-negative joint infections was similar to the overall outcome in the entire series of patients. All 11 joints with infected prostheses ultimately required removal of the prostheses. All patients were treated with appropriate parenteral antibiotics, and surgical intervention was used in 40 joints. Six patients underwent surgical treatment because of inability to sterilize the joint with antibiotics and because of repeated joint aspirations. The outcome with surgical intervention was good only in patients younger than 16 years of ages. Medical therapy (parenteral antibiotics and frequent joint aspirations) led to good results in 74% of the patients. Outcome of joint infection was also influenced by factors which contribute to impaired host resistance.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies of cefoperazone in children (author's transl)].
AB  - As a result of conducting experimental and clinical tests with the newly developed cephalosporin, cefoperazone (CPZ), the following conclusions were obtained: (1) When tested against 10 strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 16 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, the antibacterial activity of CPZ was found to be weaker than that of CEZ. Against 5 strains of A-beta-Streptococcus and 4 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, both CPZ and CEZ exhibited similar excellent antibacterial activity. CPZ was effective against 18 strains of Escherichia coli though its activity was influenced by the amount of inoculated bacteria present. Against 15 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 10 strains of Haemophilus parahaemolyticus, CPZ was found to be more effective than CEZ though several high-resistant strains were noted. CPZ also showed more excellent antibacterial activity than CEZ against 4 strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 5 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 strains of Salmonella sp., 4 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 4 strains of Proteus sp. (2) The mean half-life in the blood following intravenous injections of 25 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of CPZ to three children was 70 minutes. (3) One hour after intravenous injection of 25 mg/kg of CPZ to 3 cases of aseptic meningitis, drug concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was 1.20 mcg/ml, less than 0.39 mcg/ml and 1.55 mcg/ml. In one case, the CSF/serum ratio was 2.7%. (4) The average recovery rate in the urine of children who had received intravenous administrations of 25 mg/kg (3 children) and 10 mg/kg (1 child) was 17.8% between 0 and 6 hours. (5) Eighteen pediatric patients received CPZ in doses ranging from 48 to 170 mg/kg divided three-four times a day. They were RTI in 7, URI in 5, UTI in 5, SSSS in 1 and enteritis in 1 children. The clinical effectiveness of CPZ was judged to be remarkedly effective in 11 children, effective in 5 children and ineffective in 3 children, with an overall effective rate of 84.2%. One patient of tonsillitis combined sinusitis was considered 2 cases. The three cases in which the drug was found to e ineffective were 2 cases of pyothorax and 1 case of sinusitis. (6) Side effects were 1 case of eosinophilia, 2 cases of elevation of GOT and GPT, and 1 case of mild elevation of GOT. All were considered to be minor.
TI  - Hearing alterations following meningitis. 1. Hearing improvement.
AB  - In ten patients suffering from hearing loss following meningitis or meningoencephalitis, hearing recovery was observed. Eight of the cases had suffered from purulent meningitis, five cases had Haemophilus influenzae meningitis, 1 had coli meningitis, and 1 had meningococcal meningitis. In one case, the ethiologic agent remained unknown. Two other cases had suffered from viral meningoencephalitis. Postmeningitis hearing loss was observed in 19 ears. In eight ears, the hearing loss was profound, and in eleven, it was slight to moderate. Recovery of hearing occurred in 16 ears and was complete in eight ears and partial in eight ears. Approximately one-fourth of all patients with meningitis hearing loss do recover partially or completely in both ears or only in one ear.
TI  - Microorganisms isolated from blood and cerebrospinal fluid in a general hospital. Clinical implications.
AB  - This study is a review of 1,040 significant positive blood cultures from 415 patients, and 44 positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures from 44 patients treated at the Meir General Hospital during the period 1976-78. The most frequent isolates from blood cultures were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The most frequent isolates from cerebrospinal fluid cultures were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis, which were present in similar proportions. E. coli was predominant in the division of medicine, Staph. aureus in the division of pediatrics and Klebsiella in the division of surgery. Fifty percent of the E. coli isolates were sensitive to ampicillin and carbenicillin; about 80%, to cephalothin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim; and 100%, to gentamicin. Only 7% of the Klebsiella isolates were sensitive to apicillin; 72% were sensitive to cephalothin and 87%, to gentamicin. Only 18% of Staph. aureus isolates were sensitive to penicillin, but about 95% were sensitive to methicillin or cephalothin. Two of 10 salmonellae isolates and 13% of H. influenzae were resistant to ampicillin.
TI  - Mitochondrial DNA from Oenothera berteriana: PURIFICATION AND PROPERTIES.
AB  - Mitochondrial DNA (mt-DNA) from Oenothera berteriana tissue culture cells was isolated and characterized with respect to buoyant density in CsCl, melting point, contour length, and restriction fragments.Because of the rather long purification procedure very few molecules retained their circularity. Only one distinct size class of molecules with a length of 100 kilobases was found. Restriction fragments were obtained with the enzymes, restrictionendonuclease I from Serratia marcescens, restrictionendonuclease III from Haemophilus influenzae, restrictionendonuclease I from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens H, and restrictionendonuclease I from Escherichia coli (Bohnert 1977 Exp Cell Res 106: 426-430); the added lengths of these fragments amounted to 180 to 190 kilobases. As in other higher plants, an intermolecular heterogeneity has to be postulated to explain the large number of restriction fragments. Unique to the mt-DNA from Oenothera berteriana, as compared to other higher plants, is the unusual high guanosine + cytosine content with 51% as determined by the buoyant density in CsCl of 1.710 grams/cubic centimeter and the melting point of 90 C.
TI  - Indirect sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for rapid detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3 antigen.
AB  - An indirect sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of the polysaccharide antigen of type 3 pneumococcus (SSS-III) is reported. Polystyrene balls with attached anti-SSS-III antibody serve as the solid phase, and antigen is detected using an alkaline phosphatase-labeled antiglobulin conjugate. The reaction is quantitated by spectrophotometry. Concentrations of antigen are estimated by comparison with standard curves prepared with purified SSS-III. For this assay, the practical lower limit of detection of SSS-III is approximately 2 to 3 ng/ml, thus making the test sensitivity about 25 times that reported for counterimmunoelectrophoresis. In preliminary tests with simulated human clinical specimens, none of the body fluids tested (spinal fluid, serum, urine, and sputum) interfered with detection of antigen, nor did they produce false-positive or false-negative results. Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3 whole organisms were readily detected in simulated clinically positive sputum specimens. Cross-reactions were not observed with Haemophilus influenzae type b, group B Streptococcus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Properties of Haemophilus influenzae mutants that are slightly recombination deficient and carry a mutation in the rec-1 gene region.
AB  - The highly recombination-deficient rec-1 mutants of Haemophilus influenzae are, as far as tested, equivalent to recA mutants of Escherichia coli. By selection for mutations in the rec-1 gene of H. influenzae, mutants designated ird (intermediary recombination-deficient) mutants were isolated; these mutants were much less recombination deficient (degree of transformability, 0.2 to 30% of wild-type value) than previously isolated rec-1 mutants (degree of transformability, 0.0001% of wild-type value). The ird mutants were more sensitive to ultraviolet irradiation and mytomycin C treatment than the wild type, but less sensitive than rec-1 mutants. Spontaneous production of phage HP1c1 by lysogenic MC11 cells and prophage induction by mitomycin C or ultraviolet irradiation were the same as in the wild type. In the ird mutants endogenous deoxyribonucleic acid was degraded both spontaneously and after ultraviolet irradiation to the same extent as in the wild type. Examination of one of the ird mutants revealed that recombination could be enhanced by ultraviolet irradiation, possibly because of an increased synthesis of the rec-1 gene product induced by ultraviolet irradiation.

TI  - GR-20263: a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with high activity against Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The in vitro activity of GR-20263, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was compared with the activities of other beta-lactam antibiotics by using 800 clinical bacterial isolates. GR-20263 was highly active (inhibition of 90% of the isolates between 0.03 and 1 microgram/ml) against the common Enterobacteriaceae and 5 to 20 times more active than cefuroxime, cefoxitin, and cephalothin. GR-20263 was three to six times less active than cefotaxime against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella, and Shigella, but three to four times more active than cefotaxime against Proteus vulgaris and Serratia marcescens. The activity of GR-20263 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with minimal inhibitory concentrations of 2 and 8 micrograms/ml for 90 and 100% of the isolates, respectively) was similar to that of tobramycin, 2 times that of cefsulodin, 5 times that of piperacillin, and 10 times that of cefotaxime. Against Haemophilus influenzae GR-20263 was three time more active than ampicillin. The beta-lactamase-producing strains were as susceptible to GR-20263 as the beta-lactamase-negative strains. GR-20263 was less active than cefotaxime and ampicillin against Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Hypoglycemia as a manifestation of sepsis.
AB  - Hypoglycemia has rarely been described as a clinical sign of severe bacterial sepsis. We recently encountered nine patients in whom hypoglycemia (mean serum glucose of 22 mg/dl) was associated with overwhelming sepsis. Clinical disease in these patients included pneumonia and cellulitis; in three patients, no focus of infection was apparent. Altered mental status, metabolic acidosis, leukopenia, abnormal clotting studies and bacteremia were common features in these cases. In four patients, no cause for hypoglycemia other than sepsis was present. In five patients, another possible metabolic cause for hypoglycemia was present (alcoholism in four and chronic renal insufficiency in one) although none had been observed to be hypoglycemic on previous hospitalizations. Streptococcus pneumoniae (three cases) and Hemophilus influenzae, type b, (two cases) were the most common pathogens, and the over-all mortality was 67 per cent. The mechanism(s) for hypoglycemia with sepsis is not well defined. Depleted glycogen stores, impaired gluconeogenesis and increased peripheral glucose utilization may all be contributing factors. Incubation of bacteria in fresh blood at room temperature does not increase the normal rate of breakdown of glucose suggesting that the hypoglycemia occurs in vivo. Hypoglycemia is an important sign of overwhelming sepsis that may be more common than has previously been recognized.

TI  - Clinical pharmacology of two chloramphenicol preparations in children: sodium succinate (iv) and palmitate (oral) esters.
AB  - The clinical pharmacology of chloramphenicol was evaluated in 14 children with serious bacterial infections. The children received chloramphenicol sodium succinate intravenously for five to six days at which time orally administered chloramphenicol palmitate was substituted for an additional five to six days of therapy. The mean peak serum chloramphenicol concentration when given iv (28.2 +/- 5.1 micrograms/ml) occurred within one hour after the termination of the 60-minute iv infusion and when given orally (19.3 +/- 2.6 micrograms/ml) occurred two to three hours after ingestion. Differences in serum levels of chloramphenicol after iv compared to oral administration of the same dose could be demonstrated at various time points studied during the dose-response curves; however, the areas under the chloramphenicol curve were not significantly different after iv (140 +/- 116 micrograms/ml/hour) versus oral (95 +/- 26 micrograms/ml/hour) administration. In seven patients who had concomitant serum and CSF chloramphenicol levels determined, a CSF to serum ratio of 23 to 85% occurred. The CSF levels (5.5 to 13 micrograms/ml) were not directly proportional to serum levels. All patients recovered from their infection and no side effects from chloramphenicol were encountered. Administration of chloramphenicol orally in the palmitate form produces serum concentrations and areas under the disappearance curve similar to those achieved after iv administration of the same dose, indicating that the oral route is an effective method of achieving therapeutic concentrations of chloramphenicol in serum.
TI  - Cytomegalovirus and dual infection in infants.
AB  - In four unrelated infants without underlying immunodeficiency, dual infections with cytomegalovirus (CMV) and another microorganism developed. The patients included the following: (1) a 3-month-old girl with congenital CMV and perinatal cutaneous herpes simplex virus; (2) a 5-week-old girl with CMV and Pneumocystis carinii; (3) a 12-week-old girl with CMV and Haemophilus influenzae meningitis; and, (4) a 2 1/2-month-old girl with CMV and Escherichia coli meningitis. In all four cases, the patient's initial symptoms were referable not to CMV, but to the companion infecting organism. The diagnoses of CMV infection were made, respectively, by a high index of clinical suspicion in the first three cases and on the basis of a lucent parenchymal defect on computerized tomographic scan in the fourth patient. These cases provide additional evidence that CMV infection may predispose to secondary infection. We recommend that infants who have signs of infection and evidence of CNS abnormalities have cultures made for CMV. Both human CMV and experimental murine CMV infections have been associated with suppressed cellular and possibly humoral immunity.
TI  - Moxalactam (6059-S), a novel 1-oxa-beta-lactam with an expanded antibacterial spectrum: laboratory evaluation.
AB  - Moxalactam (6059-S) {7beta-[2-carboxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetamido]-7alpha-methoxy-3-[[(1-methyl-1H-t etrazol-5-yl)thio]-methyl]-1-oxa-1-dethia-3-cephem-4- carboxylic acid disodium salt} is a new semisynthetic 1-oxa-beta-lactam derivative for parenteral use. It was highly active against a broad range of gram-negative microorganisms, including those resistant to other cephalosporins. Moreover, it had widely expanded antibacterial spectra which included Haemophilus influenzae, indole-positive Proteus, Enterobacter, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacteroides fragilis. When a large number of clinical isolates of the above-named bacilli were tested by the agar dilution method, using an inoculum size of one loopful of 10(6) or 10(8) organisms or both per ml, the 70% minimal inhibitory concentrations at the lower inoculum were 0.2, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 25, and 0.8 mug/ml, respectively. Its activity appeared to be independent of inoculum size and addition of serum. In these organisms, morphological response of the exposed cells revealed that the bacteriolytic effect of 6059-S was initiated by a concentration equivalent to the minimal inhibitory concentration. 6059-S was markedly bactericidal to both beta-lactamase-producing and -nonproducing strains of Escherichia coli; this was well reflected by its extraordinary stability to microbial beta-lactamase degradation. Administered subcutaneously in mice, 6059-S attained plasma levels and a half-life similar to those of cefazolin and exhibited potent protective efficacy against systemic infections; it also proved to be significantly more effective than either sulbenicillin or piperacillin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and than either cefazolin or cefmetazole against a variety of other gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of cefotaxime and ceftizoxime (FK749): new cephalosporins with exceptional potency.
AB  - Cefotaxime and its desacetoxymethyl derivative, ceftizoxime (previously known as  FK749), are both extremely active against a wide spectrum of bacteria. In the present comparative study, the activity of ceftizoxime exceeded that of cefotaxime by a factor of four or more for strains of Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Providencia, Serratia, and Bacteroides; the only species for which the activity of cefotaxime exceeded that of ceftizoxime by a factor of four was Vibrio cholerae. Against other species, the activity of the two drugs was roughly comparable. Both showed outstanding activity against Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Comparative turbidimetric and morphological studies revealed that ceftizoxime was able to induce spheroplast formation and rapid lysis in Escherichia coli strains at lower concentrations than cefotaxime. This difference was not found, however, when E. coli strains resistant to ampicillin by an intrinsic (nonenzymic) mechanism were tested.
TI  - [Airborne microflora found in some stations of the metro in the Hungarian capital of Budapest (author's transl)].
AB  - Both the microflora and some physical parameters of the air in three underground  railway (metro) stations were analysed. The air samples taken in the first two stations contained considerably more microbes, namely three times as many, than the sample from station No. 3. In the samples from the first two stations both the pathogenic and anthropogenic germs occured more frequently than in the samples from the third station. The normal flora consisted of gram-positive cocci/Streptococci, Micrococci, Sarcina. Roughly 10 per cent of the microbes proved to be spore-formers. Selective investigations led to the detection of Staph. aureus, Enterococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichiae, Klebsiella and Proteus bacteria. The reason why the stations of line 2 were found to be contaminated to a greater degree is probably because of the higher passenger traffic, the smaller space, as well as the stronger airflow due to the artificial ventilation and the piston effect of the trains. The effect of the artificial environmental conditions on the staff of the metro company still needs further investigation. The effect on the passengers is considered to be less pronounced.
TI  - Intravenous cefotaxime in children with bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Thirteen children with meningitis due to Haemophilus influenzae, beta-haemolytic  streptococcus group B, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Neisseria meningitidis, Escherichia coli, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa and who had been unsuccessfully treated with other antibiotics or had causative organisms which were resistant to available antibiotics were treated with intravenous cefotaxime. Nine children were cured; in one case infection (with a different organism) recurred but a further course of cefotaxime was successful; one child died, with sterile CSF; one child died from his underlying disease (astrocytoma); and one child was cured with sequelae (hydrocephalus). A further child with meningitis caused by E. coli had been treated unsuccessfully by intravenous and intraventricular chloramphenicol and gentamicin; intravenous and intraventricular cefotaxime was successful. The agent was well tolerated. CSF levels were measured in seven children and ranged from 300 to 27 200 microgram/l; published and unpublished in-vitro studies suggest that minimum inhibitory concentrations for cefotaxime against the organisms commonly causing bacterial meningitis are usually well below 250 microgram/l.
TI  - Cefamandole in the treatment of serious bone and joint diseases.
AB  - The safety and efficacy of treatment with cefamandole were evaluated in 77 patients (from 33 institutions) with serious bone and joint infections. The antibiotic was given intramuscularly or intravenously in doses ranging from 1.5 to 12 g/day for 6 to 58 days. Seventy-three of the 77 patients responded satisfactorily, and 63 (of 70 from whom material for culture was obtainable) patients had a bacteriologic cure. Forty-one of 81 isolates were identified as Staphylococcus aureus. Other pathogens included Streptococcus epidermidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter sp., Escherichia coli, aerobic and anaerobic cocci, as well as Bacteroides fragilis. The drug was well tolerated. Pharmacological studies indicated that cefamandole penetrated the bones and joints. Cefamandole would seem to be a safe and efficacious drug, for the treatment of serious bone and joint infections due to a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms.
TI  - Cefamandole treatment of pulmonary infection caused by gram-negative rods.
AB  - The increasing incidence of pneumonia caused by H. influenza and the problem of beta lactamase production (18% of strains in recent reports) are important considerations in the therapy of pneumonia. An antibiotic that is effective for these strains and other common respiratory pathogens will be useful for the therapy of pneumonia. Cefamandole nafate is a new cephalosporin antibiotic with an antimicrobial spectrum similar to cephalothin with increased activity against Escherichia coli, Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., and Haemophilus influenzae. Seventeen patients with pneumonia presumed to be due to susceptible gram-negative organisms isolated from transtracheal aspirate or sputum were treated with 6 to 8 g/day of parenteral cefamandole nafate. Organisms isolated were Haemophilus influenzae in 6, E. coli in 3, Proteus mirabilis in 2, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 1, Serratia marcescens in 1 and mixed gram-negative rods in 4. The Serratia were resistant (MIC greater than 100 microgram/ml and 50 microgram/ml): other MIC's ranged from 0.2 to 6.2 microgram/ml; median 1.6 microgram/ml. Satisfactory clinical response (improvement in pulmonary function; resolution of infiltrate; decrease in temperature, sputum production and white count) was noted in 13 of 17 patients. Two patients died from their underlying disease. Adverse clinical reactions questionably related to cefamandole included SGOT rises in 3 and rash in one. Serum antibiotic levels were 22.0 to 88.0 microgram/ml (peak) and 1.1 to 12.5 microgram/ml (trough). Sputum levels were 0.27 to 2.5 microgram/ml. Cefamandole appears to be an effective antibiotic for treatment of gram-negative pneumonia caused by susceptible organisms.

TI  - Susceptibility of 4410 clinical isolates to doxycycline.
AB  - In an 1100-bed hospital where doxycycline has been widely used, the susceptibility to doxycycline of 4410 clinical isolates was examined. Ninety-one and 80.8 per cent of the Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae strains, respectively, were susceptible to 1 mg doxycycline/l. Seventy-four per cent of the Escherichia coli and 81.7 per cent of the Klebsiella strains were inhibited by 4 mg/l. The Enterobacter and Enterococcus strains were less susceptible. Nearly all Proteus mirabilis isolates were resistant. The results are comparable to those of other studies.
TI  - Rapid differentiation of the major causative agents of bacterial meningitis by use of frequency-pulsed electron capture gas-liquid chromatography: analysis of amines.
AB  - The major causative agents of bacterial meningitis (Haemophilus influenzae serogroup B, Neisseria meningitidis serogroups B and C, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Steptococcus pneumoniae, and two types of Escherichia coli) were cultured in a chemically defined medium, and selected strains were further studied in Todd-Hewitt medium. After acidic extraction of the spent media with chloroform, a basic extraction was made with chloroform to obtain amines. A third extraction was performed on re-acidified Todd-Hewitt medium with ethyl ether to obtain hydroxyacids. The extracts were derivatized with heptafluorobutyric anhydride-ethanol to form electron-capturing derivatives, and the derivatives were analyzed on a frequency-pulsed electron capture gas-liquid chromatograph (FPEC-GLC) equipped with a PEP-2 computer. The data obtained from the study showed that amines were produced by these organisms that formed characteristic patterns. Different serotypes of K. pneumoniae and the two serogroups of N. meningitidis produced different types of FPEC-GLC profiles within serotypes. E. coli produced several hydroxy acids on Todd-Hewitt medium that made it unique among the organisms studied. The methods used are practical and the techniques have potential for use in clinical laboratories and hospitals as a valuable aid for the rapid identification of the major causative agents of bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Rapid differentiation of the major causative agents of bacterial meningitis by use of frequency-pulsed electron capture gas-liquid chromatograph: analysis of acids.
AB  - The major causative agents of bacterial meningitis, Haemophilus influenzae serogroup B, Neisseria meningitidis serogroups B and C, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and two types of Escherichia coli, were cultured in a modified chemically defined Catlin medium and in a commercial version of the unmodified Catlin medium. The spent media were extracted under acidic conditions, and electron-capturing derivatives were prepared by derivatization with trichloroethanol or haptafluorobutyric anhydride. The derivatives were analyzed on a gas chromatograph equipped with a frequency-pulsed electron capture detector and a PEP-2 computer. The data obtained from the study show that these organisms can be easily distinguished from each other on the basis of metabolic products detected in either type of medium. Three different metabolic groups were detected within two serogroups of N. meningitidis. The methods are practical, and the new technique should offer clinical laboratories and hospitals a better method for rapid identification of this important group of pathogens.
TI  - Clinical trials with cefoperazone in the field of internal medicine in Japan.
AB  - A total of 466 patients were treated with cefoperazone. The drug was usually administered by drip infusion of 2 to 4 gm/day. Therapy was described as markedly effective and moderately effective in 64 of 77 patients (83.1%) treated for urinary tract infections; 253 of 316 patients (80.1%) treated for respiratory infections; 37 of 48 patients (77.1%) treated for liver biliary duct infections; ten of 16 patients (62.5%) treated for septicemia; and seven of nine patients (77.8%) being treated for other infections. Overall, cefoperazone was effective 79.6% of all patients treated. With respect to bacteriological activity, the overall eradication rate for gram-negative organisms (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella sp, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter sp, and Proteus sp) was 81% (182/225) and for gram-positive (Staphyloccocus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis) 90% (36/40). Of 205 patients who failed to respond to previous antibiotic therapy, 67.8% were treated effectively with cefoperazone. Side effects, such as skin eruption, pyrexia and diarrhea, occurred in only 4.8% of patients treated, while laboratory abnormalities, such as elevated glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and eosinophil values, occurred in only 6.4% of the treated patients. None of these abnormal values were of clinical significance.

TI  - Opsonic activity of normal human cerebrospinal fluid for selected bacterial species.
AB  - The opsonic activity of normal human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has not been well  defined. In this study, the opsonic activity of normal CSF for laboratory and blood culture isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Hemophilus influenzae type b, and Neisseria meningitidis was measured by a quantitative assay employing radiolabeled bacteria and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. All isolates of S. aureus, except the Wood 46 strain, were opsonized in undiluted CSF (>50% uptake by polymorphonuclear leukocytes.) There was heat-stable and heat-labile opsonic activity in CSF for S. aureus. Only one blood culture isolate of E. coli was moderately well opsonized in undiluted CSF (26% uptake). None of the remaining laboratory or clinical isolates were opsonized in undiluted CSF. The S. aureus isolates were more readily opsonized in dilute normal serum than were the other bacterial species, and complement appeared to be the heat-labile opsonin in serum. However, complement may not be the heat-labile opsonin in normal CSF for S. aureus. In contrast to serum, complement C3 was not visualized on the staphylococcal cell surface by immunofluorescence microscopy and chelation of CSF did not diminish opsonic activity. This study demonstrates that normal CSF is opsonic for S. aureus but not for bacterial species that more commonly cause meningitis. These species differences in opsonic requirements may be important in the pathogenesis of meningitis.
TI  - [Study of cefuroxime in pediatric field (author's transl)].
AB  - 1. Cefuroxime (CXM) was studied for absorption and excretion in 4 pediatric patients given one shot intravenous injection of 20 approximately 25 mg/kg. The following serum levels were determined: 24.5 approximately 38.0 micrograms/ml at 30 minutes (mean 33.3 +/- 6.1 micrograms/ml), 10.0 approximately 17.0 micrograms/ml at 1 hours (mean 13.9 +/- 3.3 micrograms/ml), 3.4 approximately 7.6 micrograms/ml at 2 hours (mean 5.2 +/- 1.9 micrograms/ml, 0.7 approximately 2.1 micrograms/ml at 4 hours (mean 1.3 +/- 0.6 micrograms/ml, 0.1 approximately 0.3 microgram/ml at 6 hours (mean 0.2 +/- 0.1 microgram microgram/ml). Half-life (T 1/2) was 0.65 approximately 0.88 hour (mean 0.75 +/- 0.10 hour). Urinary levels were 1,280 approximately 7,100 micrograms/ml at 0 approximately 2 hours, 96 approximately 3,400 micrograms/ml at 2 approximately 4 hours, 68 approximately 250 micrograms/ml at 4 approximately 6 hours. Urinary recovery rate at 0 approximately 6 hours was 54.1 approximately 74.4% (mean 61.8 +/- 9.4%). 2. From the study on spinal fluid concentration in pediatric patients with Haemophilus influenzae-induced meningitis, the dose of CXM 52.2 mg/kg was given to 1 pediatric case with this disease by one shot intravenous injection. Spinal fluid levels were presumed as 9.0 micrograms/ml at 30 minutes, 6.8 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, 3.8 micrograms/ml at 2 hours and 1.2 micrograms/ml at 4 hours. 3. CXM was studied in 19 pediatric patients with bacterial infection for clinical efficacy, bacteriological effect and side effect. Clinical result was found good in 1 with purulent meningitis; excellent in 9 out of 15 with acute lobar pneumonia or acute bronchopneumonia, and good in remaining 6 cases; good in 2 with acute bronchitis; excellent in 1 with acute pyelonephritis. This represents efficacy ("excellent" plus "good") rate of 100%. Of 5 strains of H. influenzae presumed as causative organisms, 4 were disappeared and 1 was reduced. Two strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and 1 strain of Escherichia coli were disappeared. No side effect was noted in terms of clinical symptom. Laboratory examination showed elevation of GOT and GPT in 1 case, but these elevated values returned to normal after the end of the CXM treatment.
TI  - Measure of immunoglobulin G-, M-, and A-specific titers against Legionella pneumophila and inhibition of titers against nonspecific, gram-negative bacterial antigens in the indirect immunofluorescence test for legionellosis.
AB  - A crude extract of Escherichia coli O13:K92:H4 inhibited 97% of positive indirect immunofluorescence titers against a variety of gram-negative bacterial antigens while lowering Legionella pneumophila titers in only 6% of sera from patients with suspected legionellosis. Legionella-specific titers were the result of immunoglobulins G, M, and A, singly or in combination.
TI  - [Clinical results of cefuroxime (CXM) therapy in pediatric infections (author's transl)].
AB  - Cefuroxime, a new cephalosporin C antibiotic, was administered to 15 children with respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, or subcutaneous tumour. The following results were obtained. 1) CXM 30 approximately 100 mg/kg/day were used in treatment of respiratory tract infection. Eight of the eleven patients treated responded to the therapy. 2) CXM 45 approximately 75 mg/kg/day were given to 3 patients with urinary tract infection. Excellent results were obtained in all these cases. 3) One patient with subcutaneous tumour responded to CXM therapy. 4) Clinical isolates from the foci involved, i.e., Staphylococcus aureus (4 strains), Group A Streptococcus hemolyticus (1 strain), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 strain), Haemophilus influenzae (1 strain), and Escherichia coli (3 strains) were all eliminated by CXM therapy except 2 unassessable strains. 5) No noteworthy side effect was noted.
TI  - Antimicrobial selection for meningitis in young infants.
AB  - Organisms causing community-acquired meningitis in the first four months of life  were reviewed. Species of Streptococcus and Enterobacteriaceae were preponderant in the neonatal period, whereas S pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were preponderant after the first month of life. The Enterobacteriaceae, other than Salmonella, were not associated with meningitis after one month of age. Implications for antimicrobial selection were considered.
TI  - Intravenous trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in the treatment of serious infections  in children.
AB  - Intravenous TMP-SMZ was used to treat 19 infectious episodes in 18 patients ranging in age from 3 weeks to 13 years. Thirteen patients with various soft tissue or skeletal infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus pyogenes, or Acinetobacter anitratus were successfully treated. Three children with four episodes of CSF shunt infections due to coagulase-negative staphylococci were treated successfully also. The only treatment failures were in two newborn infants with enteric gram-negative bacterial ventriculitis. TMP-SMZ was given at a daily dose of 10 and 50 mg/kg, respectively, every six hours. The drug was administered intravenously for a mean duration of 10 days (range 4 to 32); in 11 patients this was followed by oral administration for a mean of nine days (range 2 to 18). Half-life of TMP after intravenous administration was 5 1/4 hours; that of SMA was 8 1/2 hours. Levels determined three to four days after starting therapy were generally higher than levels obtained at corresponding times after the first dose. CSF/blood TMP and SMA ratios, determined in four patients, were 0.6 and 0.5, respectively. Side effects were observed in 14 patients, and neutropenia was the most common adverse reaction. Intravenous TMP-SMZ is an effective antimicrobic agent in the treatment of infections due to susceptible organisms. The frequent side effects, although reversible and of no major clinical consequence, suggest that future use of TMP-SMZ should be monitored closely.
TI  - Chemical composition and biological activities of a phenol-water extract from Haemophilus influenzae type a.
AB  - Ribonucleic acid was removed from a phenol-water extract of Haemophilus influenzae type a by streptomycin sulfate. This preparation was called purified preparation or PP. It contained neutral sugars (glucose, galactose, mannose, pentose), glucosamine, amino acids, and fatty acids. Heptose and 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonic acid were not present. The biological properties and immunogenicity were compared with the activities of lipopolysaccharide of Escherichia coli or Salmonella typhimurium. Higher doses were necessary to obtain lethality in mice and Sanarelli and Shwartzman reactions with our preparations than were necessary with lipopolysaccharide. The Limulus test and pyrogen assay in rabbits gave the same results with purified preparation and lipopolysaccharide, but pyrogenicity of purified preparation was not destroyed by NaOH treatment. Purified preparation was not as immunogenic at low doeses for rabbits as lipopolysaccharide. The results were different from those obtained with lipopolysaccharide but similar to those known from peptidoglycan studies. The contamination of purified preparation with peptidoglycan was negligible and cannot explain the biological activities of purified preparation. We suggest that the phenol-water extract from H. influenzae is not a classical endotoxin, but rather an endotoxin-like substance.
TI  - Electron microscopy of malachite green--glutaraldehyde fixed bacteria.
AB  - Malachite green combined with glutaraldehyde has been used recently as a fixative for preserving and revaling lipid complexes in thin sections of eukaryotic cells examined by electron microscopy. When bacteria were prefixed with the above mixture granular electron dense inclusions were revealed in all cultures tested. These inclusions were replaced by electron transparent areas in cells fixed with glutaraldehyde alone. The structures were frequently located near to or within the nucleoid and adjacent to the cell membrane in Gram-negative bacteria and were associated with the nucleoid and mesosomes in Gram-positive species. Polyhydroxybutyrate granules, generally poorly preserved in thin sections of Aquaspirillum serpens, were well preserved by the malachite green-glutaraldehyde fixative. Malachite green complexes were observed outside of the cells in all preparations. Capsules were neither preserved nor stained.
TI  - Indirect sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for rapid detection of Haemophilus influenzae type b infection.
AB  - We report the development and testing of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with excellent sensitivity for the detection of Haemophilus influenzae type b (HI(b)) antigen in clinical specimens from patients with HI(b) meningitis. The assay, an indirect sandwich technique, uses polystyrene balls as a solid phase and an alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit globulin conjugate. Specimens are incubated with polystyrene balls armed with burro anti-HI(b) antiserum, and recognition antibody is visualized by addition of alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-globulin, together with the enzyme substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Concentrations of antigen are determined from standard curves prepared by using purified HI(b) capsular antigen polyribophosphate. The assay reproducibly detects polyribophosphate at concentrations between 1 and 5 ng/ml. Cross-reactions have not as yet been encountered in simulated and authentic clinical specimens containing other species including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, group B Streptococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria meningitidis, and Listeria monocytogenes. In preliminary tests with 11 spinal fluid specimens, 2 serum specimens, and 5 urine specimens from patients with culture-proved HI(b) meningitis, antigen was detected in all specimens in concentrations ranging from 1 to 7,000 ng/ml. Antigen was not detected in any of 62 clinical specimens which were culture negative for HI(b), including 11 spinal fluid specimens from patients with bacterial meningitis caused by microorganisms other than HI(b). The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique described here is considerably simpler than radioimmunoassay and, based on concurrent tests with 14 positive clinical specimens, may be more sensitive than counterimmunoelectrophoresis. It seems, therefore, to hold considerable promise for clinical use in rapid detection of systemic HI(b) infections.
TI  - Meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae in infant rats: protective immunity and antibody priming by gastrointestinal colonization with Escherichia coli.
AB  - Infant rats aged five to seven days were fed Escherichia coli O75:K100:H5, E. coli O13:K92:H4, or saline and five weeks later were inoculated with Haemophilus influenzae type b. The incidence of bacteremia and meningitis was significantly less (P less than 0.05) for rats fed E. coli that possessed K100 capsular antigen (cross-reactive with type b capsular antigen) than for rats fed E. coli K92 or saline. Antibody to capsular antigen was not detectable in sera obtained from rats prior to challenge with H. influenzae type b, but five days after challenge, antibody levels were significantly higher (P less than 0.001) in rats colonized with E. coli K100 than in controls. These results, together with data from passive-immunization studies, suggested that the protection against infection with H. influenzae type b was due to priming or serum anticapsular antibody, although a protective role for cell-mediated immunity and/or secretory antibody could not be ruled out. E. coli K100 primed rats vaccinated with purified H. influenzae type b antigen for a significantly increased, although transient, anticapsular antibody response.
TI  - Diagnosis of bacterial meningitis by gas-liquid chromatography. I. Chemotyping studies of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli.
AB  - With the use of gas-liquid chromatographic techniques, the chemical characteristics of Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3, Escherichia coli, group B Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Staphylococcus aureus, organisms that commonly cause bacterial meningitis, were identified. The combination of lipid, carbohydrate, and lipopolysaccharide components provided discriminating markers for chemotyping these bacteria. E. coli had a high content of 17- and 19-carbon cyclopropane fatty acids, whereas none of the other organisms tested revealed any cyclic acids, apart from a possible trace amount in S. pneumoniae. The content of isomethyl branching fatty acids clearly distinguished S. pneumoniae and S. aureus. N. meningitidis and H. influenzae were somewhat similar in their overall fatty acid compositions, but the presence of galactose without rhamnose in extracts of N. meningitidis readily distinguished N. meningitidis from H. influenzae. Only extracts from E. coli contained mannose; erythrose was an exclusive marker in extracts of S. pneumoniae. These data suggest that these differences in chemotype might be useful in developing a gas-liquid chromatographic assay of spinal fluid for the rapid laboratory diagnosis of bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Practical considerations in using counterimmunoelectrophoresis to identify the principal causative agents of bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Many clinical laboratories are currently using counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE) as an aid in the rapid diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. Because cross-reactions among causative agents have been reported, the present study was undertaken to explore the problems that might occur when reference and commercial antisera are used in CIE. Broth cultures of 35 bacterial strains were tested with 76 reference and commercial antisera by CIE. Some of the antisera tested failed to react with their homologous strains. Furthermore, several cross-reactions between genera, as well as within species, were noted. These findings suggest that precautions must be taken to insure that all materials used in CIE tests are of high quality. If properly performed and interpreted, CIE may be a valuable adjunct in the identification of organisms causing bacterial meningitis, but it is, nevertheless, a presumptive test and should not be used to replace the Gram stain and culture techniques.
TI  - [The albumin-IgG ratio in the CSF in inflammatory diseases of the CNS (author's transl)].
AB  - Levels of albumin and IgG in the cerebrospinal fluid were determined in 69 children with infectious diseases of the central of the central nervous system in the years 1975 to 1978. The cerebrospinal fluid in 63 children without infectious diseases of the central nervous system, serving as a control, showed a close correlation between albumin and IgG levels. In the acute stages of serous and purulent meningitis (meningococci, streptococci, and hemophilus influenzae) however, IgG levels in the cerebrospinal fluid were overproportionately high. Very high yet correlating levels of IgG and albumin were found in purulent meningitis due to Escherichia coli. The determination of cerebrospinal fluid levels of albumin and IgG renders information about the function of the blood cerebrospinal fluid barrier, as well as about any significant production of IgG at these sites. In case of repeated determinations information about the course of inflammation and the efficacy of antibiotic therapy can be obtained. This technique is simple and inexpensive. For one determination only 50 microliter of cerebrospinal fluid is required.
TI  - Detection of experimental bacteremia and fungemia by examination of buffy coat prepared by a micromethod.
AB  - Rabbits received intravenous injections of bacteria or fungi, and a comparison was made of the abilities of broth cultures, plating after dilution either in saline solution or in distilled water containing Triton X-100, and buffy coat examinations to detect the organisms in heart blood. The most sensitive method was broth culture. By microscopy or subculture of buffy coat cells prepared by centrifugation of blood in microhematocrit tubes, organisms were rapidly and regularly detected when their viable counts increased to 300--1,000/ml as detected by plating. By micromodification, buffy coat examination is technically easy to perform, and the method is only slightly less sensitive than when a larger amount of blood is used. Thus, it would be ideal for rapid provisional diagnosis of sepsis in patients, e.g., neonates, when the use of only a small blood sample is preferred.

TI  - Mass-spectral studies of isomeric D-ribofuranosylribitol disaccharides from the capsular polysaccharides of Haemophilus influenzae type b and Escherichia coli K 100.
AB  - Two isomeric-D-ribofuranosylribitols, derived from capsular polysaccharides of Haemophilus influenzae type b and Escherichia coli K 100, were methylated or acetylated, and the products analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The marked difference in the mass spectra of the methyl ethers of these disaccharides allowed clear distinction between 1- and 2-O-D-ribofuranosylribitol was characteristic for this disaccharide; its isomer, the (1 leads to 2)-linked species, has a base peak at m/e 57. The difference in the base peaks is attributable to fragmentation of the methylated ribitol, as both spectra display common ions characteristic of the methylated D-ribofuranosyl group. For the acetylated disaccharides, the mass spectra displayed common ions characteristic of the acetylated D-ribofuranosyl group. However, no ions similar to those found for the methylated ribitol allowed ready differentiation between the two acetates. Instead, their spectra displayed similar ions, differing somewhat in relative abundance; the M-1 ion, m/e 577, was obtained for both. Comparison of the relative abundance of m/e 139, 259, and 303 in the spectra of the two acetates did allow distinction between them.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of cefadroxil, cephalexin, and cephradine in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model.
AB  - Cefadroxil (Duricef, Mead Johnson and Company), resembles cephalexin and cephradine in spectrum of antibacterial activity but differs in human pharmacokinetic properties. Whether the latter are likely to affect activity in vivo was assessed by determining bactericidal activity against clinical isolates under conditions simulating the variation of drug concentration in the blood stream after an oral dose of 500 mg to adults. In this kinetic model, cefadroxil was more active than cephalexin or cephradine against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and one of two strains of Escherichia coli. The other strain of E. coli was virtually unaffected by the cephalosporins. S. pyogenes was equally susceptible to all three cephalosporins. Analysis of the results suggest that the pharmocokinetic properties of an antibiotic affect its activity in the blood stream, provided the susceptibility of the infecting organism is concentration-dependent within the range of drug concentration occurring in serum.
TI  - Nitrous acid mutagenesis of duplex DNA as a three-component system.
AB  - Purified native Hemophilus influenzae DNA is relatively insusceptible to nitrous  acid (NA) mutagenesis in vitro, but is readily mutated following denaturation. NA mutagenicity for duplex DNA is significantly increased in the presence of various alcohols, glycols, phenols or primary amines. Phenol-extracted DNA contains dissociable contaminants of low molecular weight that enhance NA mutagenesis. Enhancement of NA mutagenesis by phenol and by spermine is due to the formation of unstable molecular species. We propose that reactive organic nitroso compounds are formed which then serve as delivery vehicles to promote mutagenicity of native DNA, perhaps via transnitrosation reactions. Similar reactions probably occur in vivo to promote NA-induced base substitution (but not frameshift) mutations in Salmonella typhimurium and in Escherichia coli. The possible significance of these observations to carcinogenesis is discussed.

TI  - Gentamicin resistance in Christchurch hospitals.
AB  - Prior to June 1976, the isolation of gentamicin resistant organisms was an infrequent occurrence in North Canterbury Hospital Board institutions. During July 1976, 20 different gentamicin resistant organisms were isolated from patients in Christchurch Hospital. Gentamicin resistant organisms hav e been continually isolated from an increasingly wide area since then. The organisms involved are: providence species; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Klebsiella species; E coli; Staphyloccus aureus; Proteus mirabilis; Staphylococcus epidermidis; Acinetobacter species; Enterobacter species; Haemophilus influenzae; Pseudomonas maltophilia CDC II F; Citrobacter species; Alcaligenes odorans and Pseudomonas species. The spread of gentamicin resistant organisms has occurred rapidly in the hospital environment. The importance of the urinary tract as a reservoir of microorganisms is indicated in this report.
TI  - [Sensitivity of frequent-occurring isolates in outpatients to routinely-used antibiotics (author's transl)].
AB  - The susceptibility of microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Haemophilus influenzae) frequently occurring in outpatients (treated by practitioners) to six kinds of antibiotics [ampicillin (ABPC), cefazolin (CEZ), erythromycin (EM), minocycline (MNC), gentamicin (GM) and thiamphenicol (TP)] was determined by the standard method established by the Japan Society of Chemotherapy. 1) There were few multiple-antibiotic-resistant urine isolates from patients with a simple urinary tract infection, whereas urine isolates from patients with a complicated urinary tract infection contained many multiple-antibiotic resistant organisms. 2) Isolates from patients with a respiratory tract infection (sputum and tonsillar secretions isolates) and isolates from patients with acute purulent otitis media (purulent discharge isolates) contained few multiple-antibiotic-resistant organisms except for EM-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes. 3) Superficial pus isolates contained many multiple-antibiotic-resistant organisms, while bile isolates were relatively free from multiple-antibiotic resistant organisms. 4) When the results of the previous8,9) and present investigations were compared with the reports of other Japanese investigators1,5,6), suggestive evidence was provided that organisms resistant to macrolides and chloramphenicol showed a tendency to decrease, whereas organisms resistant to penicillins, cephalosporins and aminoglycoside antibiotics were on the increase.

TI  - Septicemia in association with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
AB  - Fifty consecutive episodes of septicemia were studied in 41 children who had acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Seventy-six percent of these episodes occurred when the absolute granulocyte count was 200/mm3 or less and were caused by gram-negative enteric and gram-positive mucocutaneous bacteria. In eight patients, Streptococcus pyogenes was isolated at the time when ALL was diagnosed. Multiple anaerobic and aerobic isolates from a single blood culture were associated with abdominal distress, whereas Streptococcus pneumoniae and Hemophilus influenzae septicemia occurred in associated with respiratory illnesses. When patients with severe compromise of anatomic barriers or respiratory disease were excluded, 94% of all patients with septicemia had an AGC of less than 200/mm3. The data provide guidelines for treatment for febrile patients with ALL based upon the AGC, the phase of the disease, and on the presence of associated respiratory or abdominal findings.
TI  - Molecular nature of two Haemophilus influenzae R factors containing resistances and the multiple integration of drug resistance transposons.
AB  - The 36-megadalton Haemophilus influenzae R plasmid pHK539 was found to specify resistance to tetracycline (Tc) and ampicillin (Ap). It was shown by molecular hybridization studies and by electron microscopy that the plasmid pHK539 contained the tetracycline translocation deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)segment (TnTc) as well as the ampicillin translocation segment (TnAp). The TnAp was integrated in the stem of TnTc. The 34-megadalton H. influenzae R plasmid pRI234 carried a translocatable DNA segment which specified both tetracycline and chloramphenicol (Cm) resistance. Self-annealing and DNA-DNA heteroduplex experiments indicated that this transposon is probably composed of TnTc containing an insertion of a chloramphenicol resistance transposon (TnCm). TnCm is inserted into one of the components of the TnTc inverted repetitions and is itself flanked on both sides by long inverted repetitions. The H. influenzae plasmids pHK539 and pRI234 had more than 60% of their polynucleotide sequences in common with all the other 30- to 40-megadalton R factors recently found in H. influenzae isolates from different countries. The tetracycline-chloramphenicol resistance transposon of pRI234 was integrated twice at different sites in the plasmid after its growth in medium containing tetracycline. The presence of the two copies of the transposon was correlated with higher minimum inhibitory concentrations against tetracycline as well as against chloramphenicol. After its growth in medium containing tetracycline, the H. influenzae R plasmid pFR16017 specifying Tc resistance contained one, two, three, or even four copies of TnTc integrated at different sites in the plasmid, or the loop of TnTc was amplified. The heterogeneity of the pFR16017 plasmid was seen in all single-colony isolates and correlated with a higher minimum inhibitory concentration against tetracycline.
TI  - [Standardised antibiotic therapy in major lung surgery (author's transl)].
AB  - Sputum and bronchial biopsies and smears were obtained from 221 patients who had  undergone partial pneumonectomy without preceding antibiotic therapy. The results of 343 sputum examinations and of 126 bacteriological examinations of biopsies and smears were evaluated. Pathogenic bacteria were demonstrated in about 50% of the sputa and in about 25% of the biopsies and swabs. Anaerobic micro-organisms were extremely rare. Treatment was with tetracycline. Before antibiotic therapy Haemophilus influenzae, staphylococci and E. coli predominated, afterwards there were practically only staphylococci and Esch. coli. The incidence of primary resistance to the usual antibiotics was high, especially in respect of gram-negative organisms. The difference in incidence between primary and secondary resistance was one of degree. The least effective agents were ampicillin and amoxicillin, the most active were the aminoglycosides. Erycin proved satisfactory in infections with grampositive organisms while the cephalosporins were active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The development of resistance and the clinical picture suggest that "eradication" of the infection during the postoperative stage is not advisable as it causes the selection of more or less drug-resistant organisms. A more satisfactory approach is gradually to reduce the infection until the immediate postoperative stage is over. Macroscopic and microscopic examination of the sputum is important, as the choice of the appropriate antibiotic is determined by the result of gram-staining.
TI  - Many bacterial species bind human IgD.
AB  - Forty-four bacterial strains belonging to 19 species were tested for their IgD-binding capacity by incubation with radiolabeled human IgD. A high binding of IgD to Neisseria catarrhalis and Hemophilus influenzae and a moderate binding of IgD to streptococci of the groups A, C, and G were found. Two strains of N. catarrhalis were tested for their ability to bind selectively the IgD in normal pooled serum and in three serum samples with IgD M components and were found to possess this property. Binding studies with radiolabeled IgD Fab and Fc fragments indicated that the binding mainly but not exclusively involves the CH1 region of the IgD molecule.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of azlocillin, ampicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin, alone and in combination with an aminoglycoside.
AB  - The in vitro activities of the newer semisynthetic penicillins azlocillin, mezlocillin, and piperacillin were compared with those of ampicillin and ticarcillin by using 290 clinical laboratory isolates. Piperacillin and mezlocillin were the most active against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp., and Enterobacter spp. When Pseudomonas aeruginosa was tested, piperacillin and azlocillin were more active than either mezlocillin or ticarcillin. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae species were highly susceptible to all of the penicillins tested. Ticarcillin had relatively poor activity against enterococci. The rate of bacterial killing with multiples of the minimal inhibitory concentration of azlocillin, ampicillin, or ticarcillin was tested for E. coli, P. mirabilis, P. aeruginosa, and Klebsiella spp. Increasing concentrations increased the bactericidal effect. The effect of combining azlocillin, ampicillin, or ticarcillin with an aminoglycoside was studied by using both killing curves and checkerboards. The isobolograms constructed from the checkerboards showed a synergistic pattern for the organisms tested, which included E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp., P. mirabilis, and enterococci. However, the rate of killing was increased by the combination only for P. aeruginosa and enterococci.
TI  - Molecular characterization of a small Haemophilus influenzae plasmid specifying beta-lactamase and its relationship to R factors from Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  - The ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae strain Ve445 which caused purulent meningitis and septicaemia in a newborn child in Germany contained a 4.4 megadalton (Mdal) plasmid (pVe445) and produced a TEM type beta-lactamase. The transformation to ampicillin resistance of a sensitive Escherichia coli strain with isolated pVe445 DNA proved that the structural gene for the beta-lactamase resided on this plasmid genome. Molecular DNA-DNA hybridization studies and electron microscope DNA heteroduplex analysis indicated that pVe445 probably contained 38 to 41% of the ampicillin translocation DNA segment (TnA) found on R factors of enteric origin. The TnA fragment present in pVe445 most likely does not contain both of the inverted repeat sequences of TnA. DNA-DNA polynucleotide sequence studies indicated that the 4.4 Mdal plasmid pVe445 was unrelated to the 30 to 38 Mdal H. influenzae R plasmids but was closely related to the 4.1 Mdal ampicillin resistance specifying H. influenzae plasmid RSF0885 isolated in the U.S.A. The H. influenzae plasmid pVe445 shared 91% of its base sequences with the beta-lactamase specifying Neisseria gonorrhoeae plasmid pMR0360 (4.4 Mdal) and had 85% of its base sequences in common with the beta-lactamase specifying N. gonorrhoeae plasmid pMR0200 (3.2 Mdal). All of the four 3.2 to 4.4 Mdal beta-lactamase specifying R plasmids of H. influenzae and N. gonorrhoeae investigated probably have a common evolutionary origin.
TI  - Counterimmunoelectrophoresis for rapid identification of blood-culture isolates.
AB  - A total of 303 blood cultures that were positive by examination of Gram-stained smears were tested immediately by counterimmunoelectrophoresis for detection of bacterial antigens. Antigen was detected in all 82 blood cultures containing Streptococcus pneumoniae and 11 of 22 with Klebsiella pneumoniae, two of two with Haemophilus influenzae, and one of one with Neisseria meningiditis. False-positive cross-reactions in 265 tests occurred only with pneumococcal Omniserum in two cases of nongroupable streptococcal bacteremia and with Klebsiella antiserum in one case of Escherichia coli bacteremia (1.1%). A specific identification of the microorganisms at least 24 hours earlier than by subculture technics was accomplished in 91% of the cultures containing the aforementioned bacteria. The procedure was not useful for detecting antigen in blood cultures containing Staphylococcus aureus.

AB  - The in vitro activity of HR 756, 7-[2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2-(Z)-(methoximino)acetamido] cephalosporanic acid, was investigated against 659 isolates. HR 756 inhibited Neisseria and Haemophilus species at concentrations similar to those needed with ampicillin. It inhibited beta-lactamase-producing N. gonorrhoeae and H. influenzae. HR 756 was the most active compound tested against members of the Enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting most isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella, Enterobacter, and Shigella at concentrations of less than 0.1 mug/ml. It was twice as active as carbenicillin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and inhibited Bacteroides fragilis as well as cefoxitin. HR 756 killed E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and P. aeruginosa at rates similar to other beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Plasmid-mediated ampicillin resistance in Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - Three of 19 strains of Haemophilus ducreyi, isolated during a recent outbreak of  chancroid, were found to produce beta-lactamase and to harbor a 6.0 x 10(6)-dalton plasmid. Escherichia coli transformed with this plasmid acquired beta-lactamase-mediated resistance to ampicillin. The guanine-plus-cytosine content of the plasmid was found to be 41 mol%. Restriction endonuclease digestion studies suggest that a relatively large portion of the Tn1 translocon is carried by this plasmid. Whereas this plasmid could not be transferred to H. influenzae by mating on membrane filters, a strain of H. ducreyi was able to receive and donate a 30 x 10(6)-dalton ampicillin resistance plasmid from H. influenzae. The ability of H. ducreyi to receive and donate conjugative plasmids may result in the appearance of multiply resistant strains.
TI  - Sequence-specific DNA uptake in Haemophilus transformation.
AB  - Haemophilus cells efficiently take up Haemophilus DNA from the medium during transformation but do not take up other DNAs. To study the mechanism of this specificity we have cloned an 8.1-kilobase (kb) fragment of H. parainfluenzae DNA in the escherichia coli--pBR322 host--vector system and reisolated the DNA fragment for use as a defined probe. The 5'32P end-labeled 8.1-kb DNA is efficiently absorbed by competent Haemophilus cells whereas vector DNA present in the mixture is not, implying that the 8.1-kb DNA contains sequence-specific recognition sites that are needed for DNA uptake. Absorbed DNA can be recovered from cells as a 32P-labeled duplex of unaltered size for several minutes after uptake. We have determined the number and location of uptake sites in the 8.1-kb DNA by constructing a restriction endonuclease cleavage map and assaying fragments for uptake. Only two small fragments retain the ability to be absorbed. These fragments, 120 and 140 base pairs long, are 3.8 kb apart on the 8.1-kb fragment. We assume that each of these fragments contains a short common sequence, perhaps 8--12 base pairs long, that is the actual recognition site. We have shown by DNA competition assays, with the 8.1-kb DNA as a standard, that about 600 copies of the uptake sites are present in the Haemophilus genome.
TI  - Etiology and antimicrobial therapy of acute maxillary sinusitis.
AB  - Eighty-one adults with symptoms of acute sinusitis were studied by direct needle  puncture and aspiration of the maxillary sinus (105 sinuses). Fifty-nine bacterial strains were isolated in titers of greater than or equal to 10(4) colony-forming units/ml; Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae accounted for 64% of the isolates. Other bacteria recovered included anaerobes (12%), Neisseria species (8.5%). Streptococcus pyogenes (3%), alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus (3%), non-group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (3%), Staphylococcus aureus (2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2%), and Escherichia coli (2%). Viruses were isolated from 11 sinuses; these isolates included rhinovirus (six), influenza A (H3N2) virus (three), and two types of parainfluenza virus (one each). The efficacy of therapy with orally administered ampicillin, amoxicillin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was evaluated by a repeat sinus puncture and culture. Clinical and bacteriologic responses to all three regimens were good.

TI  - Summary of laboratory studies on the antibacterial activity of cefaclor.
AB  - Laboratory aspects of cefaclor, a new orally-effective cephalosporin antibiotic,  are summarized. On the basis of data from a variety of studies, the useful antibacterial spectrum of cefaclor is shown to include all classes of bacteria that are generally susceptible to cephalothin and cephalexin. Against many Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus sp. and Streptococcus pneumoniae, cefaclor has a significant potency advantage over cephalexin. Bacteria that are susceptible to cefaclor are killed by concentrations at or near the inhibitory concentration. In vitro enzymatic hydrolysis experiments have shown that cefaclor is a relatively good substrate for several beta-lactamases. Orally administered cefaclor is effective in protection of mice from the lethal effects of intraperitoneal challenges with cefaclor-susceptible bacteria. The chemical instability of cefaclor, test medium composition and inoculum density influence the results of in vitro susceptibility tests with cefaclor. Methods for routine susceptibility testing are described.
TI  - Comparative in vivo activity of bacampicillin and amoxycillin.
AB  - Bacampicillin is an orally well-absorbed pro-drug of ampicillin giving high in vivo levels of the latter. Its therapeutic activity was compared with that of amoxycillin in two experimental infection models in mice. The animals were infected with suspensions of Escherichia coli III and Haemophilus influenzae 22863 intraperitoneally and treated orally four hours afterwards with one of the two compounds. The antibacterial activity of the compounds was determined as CD50 values or by making viable counts in the blood and in organ homogenates of the animals. Ampicillin and amoxycillin had the same inhibitory but different bactericidal activity against the test strains. Both compounds appeared to have similar therapeutic activity and were found to cause a rapid decrease of the bacterial counts in the animals. Bacampicillin appeared to give a more rapid bactericidal activity than amoxycillin against the Haemophilus influenzae strain, whereas amoxycillin initially appeared more bactericidal against the Escherichia coli infection.
TI  - In vitro comparison of synergism between cefamandole and gentamicin or tobramycin by the triple layer agar method with enzymatic inactivation.
AB  - A synergistic effect was shown with gentamicin and tobramycin by means of a triple layer agar technique and enzymatic inactivation of cefamandole after only four hours' incubation. When the strain is sensitive to cefamandole and aminoglycosides, synergy is observed against all the strains studied (Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus, Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, and Haemophilus influenzae). No significant difference was noted between the cefamandole-tobramycin and the cefamandole-gentamicin combinations when the microbial strains were sensitive to the three antibiotics.
TI  - Cyclacillin: in vitro activity against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Cyclacillin at 50 microgram/ml inhibited streptococci (100%), shigella (72%), and Bacteroides (B) fragilis ss fragilis (84%). At 100 microgram/ml it inhibited proteus (75%), B. fragilis (86%), and E. coli (50%). Cyclacillin was more effective than ampicillin against beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae. The activity of cyclacillin was found to be more enhanced when tested in nutrient agar and Mueller-Hinton agar than in brain heart infusion agar.
TI  - [Ampicillin-resistant "Haemophilus": their detection and occurrence in Brussels area (author's transl)].
AB  - Three hundred and five strains of Haemophilus (129 H. influenzae, 55 H. parainfluenzae, 97 H. parahaemolyticus, 5 H. haemolyticus, 10 H. paraphrophilus and 9 H. paraphrohaemolyticus) isolated from pathological material over the year 1976, were systematically tested for beta-lactamase production. Only 2 strains of H. parainfluenzae produced this enzyme. Both were able to transfer ampicillin resistance to Escherichia coli K12. All strains but the two beta-lactamase producers were susceptible to penicillin G, ampicillin and cephalotin. However, the correct interpretation of the susceptibility tests needed the microscopic observation of prints of the inhibition zones surrounding the disks: all sensitive strains presented a hazy growth around the disks which corresponded to the presence of spheroplasts; this phenomenon was not observed with the 2 beta-lactamase producing strains of H. parainfluenzae which grew up to the disks but presented a typical bacillary form.
TI  - Comparative activities of ampicillin, epicillin and amoxycillin in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of three aminopenicillins ampicillin, epicillin and  amoxycillin were compared in vitro and in vivo. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the three penicillins were very similar and the compounds were active against non-beta-lactamase-producing strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Shigella species, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Streptococci including Streptococcus faecalis, and non-beta-lactamase-producing staphylococci were also sensitive to the compounds but Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter and indole-positive Proteus species were resistant. At concentrations close to MIC value epicillin and ampicillin showed similar bactericidal activity against E. coli and against S. typhi and both compounds caused a slower rate of kill than was seen with amoxycillin. Microscopical observation of the cells exposed to ampicillin and epicillin for 1 h showed the presence of filamentous forms which lysed slowly, whereas cells exposed to amoxycillin for the same period rapidly. Epicillin was similar to or slightly less active than ampicillin against experimental mouse infections, and against the majority of infections both compounds were significantly less effective than amoxycillin by the oral and subcutaneous routes of administration.

TI  - Emergence of antibiotic resistance in hospitals, 1935-1975.
AB  - A limited review of the changes in susceptibility of common bacterial pathogens to available antibacterial agents is presented. Significant developments in recent years include the following: (1) the emergence of Streptococcus pneumoniae with decreased resistance to penicillin and of some strains resistant to several antibiotics; (2) a decline in prevalence of multi-drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus after 1960 following their increasing prevalence in the preceding years (these changes were methicillin-resistant (and multi-drug-resistant) S. aureus and the marked differences in their prevalence in different areas (these changes also were related to appearance of new phages in those organisms); (4) an increasing resistance to multiple drugs among enterococci but not among viridans streptococci or among nonenterococcal group D streptococci; (5) the emergence of beta-lactamase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae; (6) the emergence and spread of sulfonamide-resistant Neisseria meningitidis; (7) the occurrence of beta-lactamase-producing strains of Haemophilus influenzae and occasional strains resistant to chloramphenicol; (8) the focal occurrence of chloramphenicol-resistant Salmonella typhi in Vietnam and in epidemic form in Mexico; (9) the demonstration of marked differences in prevalence of resistance to multiple drugs in common pathogens to the most widely used antibiotics in different geographic areas. The dominant factor in the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens, whether in hospital wards or in the community, is clearly the intensive use of the antibiotic agents to which resistance emerges and then spreads.
TI  - [In vitro activity of cefaclor (author's transl)].
AB  - A comparative study was conducted on the in vitro activity of cefaclor and other  oral cephalosporins against a large number of freshly isolated clinical strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The activity of cefaclor against gram-positive pathogens is very similar to that of cephalexin. The action of cefaclor against Streptococcus pneumoniae is superior. Cefaclor is the most active antibiotic against strains of Haemophilus influenzae, and is also more active than cephalexin and cephradine against non-beta-lactamase producing strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species and Proteus mirabilis.

TI  - Clinical and pharmacokinetic evaluation of nafcillin in infants and children.
AB  - Nafcillin (150 mg/kg/day, divided every six hours) was administered intravenously to 46 patients ranging from 5 to 163 months of age with suspected or proved bacterial infections. Thirteen of 15 patients with bacteriologically proved infection responded to nafcillin. Two patients with cellulitis due to Escherichia coli or to Hemophilus influenzae type b did not improve with nafcillin therapy. A mean serum nafcillin concentration of 48 microgram/ml was observed 30 minutes after a dose of 37.5 mg/kg. The mean serum half-life was 0.76 hours. There was no significant relation between age and serum half-life, volume of distribution, or plasma clearance rate. Two patients developed neutropenia and six other patients developed an eosinophilia greater than 400/mm3 while receiving nafcillin. No significant toxic effect of nafcillin on liver or renal function was observed. One patient had phlebitis. There was a significant correlation between nfacillin concentrations and serum inhibitory and bactericidal titers (P less than 0.001). Results from this study indicate that nafcillin is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of infections due to susceptible bacteria in the dosage tested.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics and safety of cefamandole in infants and children.
AB  - Cefamandole, a new cephalosporin antibiotic, has greater activity against common  pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Proteus (including indole-positive strains), than available cephalosporin drugs. We have evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of this drug in 30 infants and children. Blood levels and urinary excretion of the drug were similar to those previously found in adults. The only side effects were mild and transient elevation of serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase in 12 patients and of blood urea nitrogen in 1 patient in whom serum creatinine remained normal and unchanged.
TI  - Binding of HLA antigen-containing liposomes to bacteria.
AB  - Highly purified, detergent-solubilized HLA-A and -B antigens and HLA-D antigens were separately incorporated into liposomes. Detergent-solubilized transplantation antigens, but not papain-solubilized antigens lacking the membrane-integrated portions of the molecules, were bound to the liposomes. A considerable portion of the liposome-bound antigens displayed accessible antigenic sites, suggesting that they were oriented in the right-side-out direction. Liposomes containing the HLA-A and -B antigens or the HLA-D antigen interacted similarly with bacteria. The two types of liposomes bound efficiently to two strains of Neisseria catarrhalis (now classified as Branhamella catarrhalis) and to one strain of Haemophilus influenzae, weakly to one strain of Escherichia coli, and not at all to another strain of E. coli. The binding between the HLA antigen-containing liposomes and one strain of N. catarrhalis was abolished when Fab fragments directed against the heavy chains of HLA-A and -B antigens or against HLA-D antigens, respectively, were added. In contrast Fab fragments against beta(2)-microglobulin did not measurably impede the bacteria-liposome interaction, suggesting that, with regard to the HLA-A and -B antigens, the heavy, but not the light, chains interacted with the bacteria. Additional experiments showed that N. catarrhalis preferentially interacted with transplantation antigens when mixed with detergent-solubilized lymphocyte membrane glycoproteins. These data suggest that HLA-A and -B and HLA-D antigens may have the function of interacting with foreign antigens such as bacteria.
TI  - HR 756, a highly active cephalosporin: comparison with cefazolin and carbenicillin.
AB  - HR 756, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with cefazolin and carbenicillin for activity against a total of 264 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus spp. (indole positive), Enterobacter spp., Salmonella typhi, Serratia marcescens, Providencia stuartii, and Staphylococcus aureus. In every comparison, except that with the last organism, HR 756 was clearly more active than cefazolin and carbenicillin. All three compounds had similar activity against penicillin-susceptible staphylococci; against penicillin-resistant strains, HR 756 and cefazolin were equally active and superior to carbenicillin. HR 756 was compared with penicillin for activity against strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Lancefield group D streptococci, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; with ampicillin against Haemophilus influenzae; and with cefoxitin against Bacteriodes fragilis. HR 756 was clearly more active than the respective reference compounds in all of these comparisons, except those involving the streptococci. HR 756 and penicillin were essentially equally active against S. pyogenes; against Lancefield group D, penicillin was 32 times as active as HR 756. HR 756 not only compared favorably with the reference compounds with respect to relative activity, but also effected growth inhibition of essentially all test organisms (P. aeruginosa and group D streptococci excepted) at remarkably low concentrations ranging from 0.015 to 2.0 mug/ml. A series of seven transfers of selected strains of E. coli, Klebsiella spp., S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa through medium containing HR 756 led to emergence of strains with significant levels of resistance to the agent. Resistance to HR 756 was retained for at least seven transfers through plain medium.

TI  - Early splenomegaly in homozygous sickle-cell disease: An indicator of susceptibility to infection.
AB  - 135 children with homozygous sickle-cell (SS) disease diagnosed at birth have been followed for 1--5 years. Severe bacterial infections were confined to those in whom the spleen was first palpable at or before 1 year of age and were commonest in those in whom the spleen was first palpable at or before age 6 months. Regular follow-up of children with SS disease diagnosed at birth will identify children particularly at risk of severe infections.
TI  - Association between cross-reacting Escherichia coli K100 and disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b.
AB  - An unexpected association between Haemophilus influenzae type b (HIB) disease and simultaneous intestinal colonization with cross-reacting Escherichia coli K100 strains is reported. E. coli K100 were found in 18 of 92 (19.5%) HIB patients, compared with 2.5% in healthy individuals of comparable age and in none of 21 patients with meningitis caused by other bacteria. There was no difference in disease outcome, serum antibodies, and circulating HIB antigen between the E. coli K100-positive and -negative HIB patients. Possible explanations and implications of this association are discussed.
TI  - Clavulanic acid, a novel inhibitor of beta-lactamases.
AB  - Clavulanic acid, Z-(2R,5R)-3-(beta-hydroxyethylidene)-7-oxo-4-oxa-1-azabicyclo-[3,2,0] heptane-2-carboxylic acid, has been shown to be an effective inhibitor of the beta-lactamases of the Richmond types II, III, IV, and V. Inhibition is a time-dependent reaction and is irreversible. Clavulanic acid had poor antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with minimal inhibitory levels greater than 25 mug/ml. It did inhibit the majority of Neisseria gonorrhoeae at 0.1 mug/ml and Haemophilus influenzae at 6.3 mug/ml. Clavulanic acid acted synergistically with penicillins and cephalosporins to inhibit beta-lactamase-producing S. aureus and Enterobacteriaceae. Clavulanic acid combined with ampicillin inhibited beta-lactamase-producing N. gonorrhoeae, H. influenzae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, and Shigella sonnei.
TI  - SCE-963, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin: in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities.
AB  - SCE-963 {7beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)acetamido]-3-[({1-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)-  1H-tetrazol-5-yl}thio)methyl]-ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid}, a new semisynthetic cephalosporin, showed excellent antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including Haemophilus influenzae, indole-positive Proteus, Enterobacter species, and Citrobacter freundii. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of SCE-963 against most strains of clinically isolated Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and Proteus mirabilis were within the range of 0.2 to 0.78 mug/ml. These activities were about 10 times more potent than those of cefazolin, cephaloridine, and cephalothin. Variations in pH, addition of horse serum, and type of growth medium had no significant effect on the activity of the cephalosporin, but the inoculum size elicited a considerable effect on the activity of beta-lactamase-producing strains of bacteria. SCE-963 exerted bactericidal and bacteriolytic effects on Staphylococcus aureus and E. coli. The pronounced in vitro activity was reflected in the remarkable protection in mice infected with a wide range of gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus morganii, and Proteus rettgeri. The protective effects of SCE-963 in mice infected with E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. vulgaris varied according to the challenge dose. The activity of SCE-963 was far more potent when the drug was administered parenterally rather than orally.
TI  - Comparison of the in vitro activity of Bay k 4999 and piperacillin, two new antipseudomonal broad-spectrum penicillins, with other beta-lactam drugs.
AB  - Bay k 4999 and piperacillin, two new substituted ampicillins, were compared with  other beta-lactam antibiotics, including carbenicillin, azlocillin, mezlocillin, benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, and cefoxitin, against a wide range of gram-positive and -negative organisms. Bay k 4999 and piperacillin were extremely active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (50% inhibited by 2 mug/ml), being about 16-fold more active than carbenicillin. Bay k 4999 was the most active drug against Escherichia coli (50% inhibited by 0.5 mug/ml) and Klebsiella spp. (50% inhibited by 2 mug/ml). Piperacillin and Bay k 4999 were equally active against Proteus spp., and piperacillin had high activity against Bacteroides fragilis (50% inhibited by between 1 and 2 mug/ml).
TI  - Countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis (CIEP) in the diagnosis of childhood meningitis.
AB  
TI  - Evaluation of the counterimmunoelectrophoretic (CIE) procedure in a clinical laboratory setting.
AB  - The counterimmunoelectrophoretic (CIE) procedure was evaluated under clinical laboratory conditions to determine its validity and comparability with culture methods. The procedure was further evaluated to determine applicability to a variety of clinical samples. An inexpensive set-up was developed to utilize the CIE procedure at bench level. Results indicated the procedure to be sensitive in detecting Haemophilus influenzae, type b, and Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus), group B. The procedure was more sensitive for detection of H. influenzae, type b, than for meningococcus, group B. The authors have confirmed the usefulness of the CIE procedure in the detection of group B streptococci, pneumococci and teichoic acid antibody to Staphylococcus aureus. Detection of Escherichia coli K 1 antigen was also accomplished by CIE. In the authors' laboratory the CIE procedure was superior to culture methods when used for the detection of H. influenzae, type b, and meningococcus group B.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on new semisynthetic penicillin, PC-904, in pediatric field (author's transl)].
AB  - PC-904 was administered to 16 pediatric patients and the following basic and clinical results were obtained. (1) PC-904 was administered 20 approximately 30 mg/kg. The serum peak level of PC-904 after drip intravenous infusion over 1 hour was 66.7 microgram/ml at 1 hour and T 1/2 of PC-904 was 67.8 minutes. PC-904 was administered 25 approximately 30 mg/kg intravenous one shot injection was 49.4 microgram/ml at 1 hour and T 1/2 of PC-904 was 52.2 minutes. (2) Urinary excretion rate was about 20% up to 6 hours after drip intravenous infusion of 20 mg/kg. In a case of intravenous one shot injection of 25 approximately 30 mg/kg, the excretion rate was 11.9 approximately 19.9%. (3) PC-904 was administered 60 approximately 120 mg/kg/day for 3 approximately 48 days to 5 cases of sepsis and bacterial endocarditis, 6 of pneumonia, 2 of sss syndrome (staphylococcal scald skin syndrome) and 3 of pyelonephritis. Clinical effects were excellent in 11 cases and good in 5 cases, effective ratio being 100%. (4) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus viridans, Acinetobacter anitratus and Hemophilus influenzae isolated from clinical specimens disappeared by the treatment of PC-904, and Hemophilus influenzae isolated from clinical specimens disappeared by the treatment of PC-904. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae reduced. (5) As to the side effect by PC-904, s-GOT and s-GPT were elevated in 2 cases. Anemia, rash and fever were observed in each 1 case out of 16 patients though the causal relation with the agent was unknown.
TI  - The critical role of iron in host-bacterial interactions.
AB  - The ability of potential pathogens to acquire iron in a host is an important determinant of both their virulence and the nature of the infection produced. Virulent gram-negative bacteria are capable of acquiring sufficient iron from the host because their virulence (for chick embryos) is unaffected by exogenous iron. Avirulent mutants which are apparently limited in their ability to acquire iron could be isolated from the virulent strains. The lethality of these mutants was significantly enhanced by exogenous iron. Reduction of the relatively high serum iron saturation of chick embryos (to levels more closely approximating those in man) by pretreatment with iron-binding proteins or endotoxin inhibits the lethality of some virulent bacteria. Those bacteria whose virulence was reduced include the Shigella, Vibrio cholerae and strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, all of which are nondisseminating pathogens in the normal human host. Pathogens which produce septicemic and disseminating infections such as Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae type B, Escherichia coli possessing K-1 antigen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium and disseminating strains of N. gonorrhoeae were, in general, unaffected by reduced serum iron saturation. These disseminating bacteria appeared to produce greater quantities of compounds (siderophores) which stimulated microbial growth in low-iron media than did the nondisseminating pathogens. Thus, the gram-negative bacteria tested can be divided into four major classes according to their responses to modifications in iron levels in the chick embryo model and these results correlate with the nature of the infections which they typically produce in man.
TI  - A DNase for apurinic/apyrimidinic sites associated with exonuclease III of Hemophilus influenzae.
AB  - An endonuclease purified from Hemophilus influenzae made single strand breaks in  DNA containing apurinic or apyrimidinic sites but had no detectable endonuclease activity on untreated native DNA. The new 5'-termini created at the cleavage sites were base-free deoxyribose 5-phosphate residues. The enzyme preparation also catalyzed the exonucleolytic release of 5'-mononucleotides from bihelical DNA and the hydrolysis of DNA 3'-terminal phosphomonoesters. The phosphatase-exonuclease activity was indistinguishable from that reported by Gunther and Goodgal (J. Biol. Chem. (1970) 245, 5341-5349) and resembled that of exonuclease III of Escherichia coli. The endonucleolytic and exonucleolytic activities could not be separated by electrophoresis, sedimentation, or gel filtration, and they were also affected simultaneously by mutation. The enzymatic activities appear to be functions of a single monomeric protein (M(r) = 30,000).
TI  - Antibacterial activity of cefamandole in vitro.
AB  - Cefamandole, a new cephalosporin derivative, was found to have a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against a cross-section of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated clinically. Gram-positive cocci, except for Streptococcus faecalis, were extremely susceptible to cefamandole; penicillin G-resistant Staphylococcus aureus also was highly susceptible. Minimal bactericidal concentrations for gram-positive cocci approximated the minimal inhibitory concentrations. Strains of Haemophilus influenzae were very susceptible to the drug. Most strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, and Proteus species were inhibited by low concentrations of cefamandole, Salmonella typhi, including ampicillin- and chloramphenicol-resistant strains, was inhibited by low concentrations of cefamandole. Susceptible bacteria became increasingly resistant as the inoculum size was increased. Strains of Pseudomonas were resistant to cefamandole.
TI  - Survival of upper respiratory tract bacteria on cotton-wool swabs.
AB  - Plain, buffered cotton-wool swabs and albumen-coated cotton-wool swabs were prepared with known numbers of the following: Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, corynebacteria and Escherichia coli. Swabs were plated immediately (0 hours) after loading with a 0.1 ml standardised inoculum; each swab was plated out four times by streaking on both halves of two plates. At 0 hours recovery rates from first platings on solid media ranged from 3.3%-8.9%; from platings 1-4 ranges were 2.5%-5.7%. Both types of swabs gave similar results. The greater the delay in plating swabs at room temperature and 4 degrees C the lower was the recovery rate of H. influenzae and Strep. pneumoniae, though both species survived better on either kind of swab when these were held at 4 degrees C. There was a very small reduction in numbers of Staph. aureus from 24 to 48 hours but the recovery rate of corynebacteria was similar over the 48-hour period, at both room temperature and 4 degrees C. Twenty-four-hour counts of E. coli at room temperature were approximately five times greater than at 0 hours, and at 48 hours colonies were too numerous to count. At 4 degrees C, however, counts of E. coli fell during the 48-hour period.
TI  - Hemophilus influenzae type b disease in a day-care center. Report of an outbreak.
AB  - Four episodes of serious Hemophilus influenzae type b infection occurred in three children attending a day-care center. This was 100 times the expected annual total. The pharyngeal carriage rate of Hib was 60% for siblings of patients, 20% for adult household contacts, and 5% for well children at the center. No carriers were found in control populations. Escherichia coli K100, which cross-reacts serologically with Hib, was found in rectal swabs of 20% of family contacts of patients and 3.5% of well children at the center. It was recovered from two of seven persons who carried Hib in the pharynx and two of 75 who did not (P = 0.035), suggesting that carriage of one organism may facilitate carriage of the other. In a randomized prospective trial with 85 patient contact, Hib carriage was eradicated in all of four carriers given ampicillin and in all of three given rifampin. There were no statistically significant differences in the rate of adverse reactions in the two treatment groups. No further cases were reported.
TI  - Molecular properties of transmissible R factors of Haemophilus influenzae determing tetracycline resistance.
AB  - The tetracycline-resistant Haemophilus influenzae strains LU121 and FR16017, recently isolated in West Germany, each harbour a plasmid; that of the former (pLU12U) has a mol. wt of 31.5 X 10(6) and that of the latter (pFR16017) has a mol. wt of 33 X 10(6). Conjugation and DNA-DNA hybridization studies have shown that both plasmids are self-transmissible and carry tetracycline-resistance genes. The purified plasmid DNA of H. influenzae strain LU121 transformed a sensitive Escherichia coli strain to tetracycline resistance. The two R factors are closely related to the H. influenzae plasmid specifying ampicillin resistance (pKRE5367). Electron microscope DNA heteroduplex analysis indicated that pLU121 and pFR15017 probably carry the tetracycline-resistance transposon TnD and that pKRE5367 probably carries the ampicillin-resistance transposon TnA. There is more than one integration site for the insertion which probably represents TnD in pFR15017. All three plasmids have a similar plasmid core and could have a common evolutionary origin.
TI  - Evidence against the reversion of mutation in the Haemophilus influenzae phage HP1c1 by preinfection treatment of host cells or phage with MNNG.
AB  - N-Methyl-N'-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) causes reversion of a temperature-sensitive mutation in a bacteriophage of Haemophilus influenzae if exposure to the mutagen takes place after infection but before lysis. However, neither pre-infection treatment of the phage DNA, host cells, or both will cause reversion. The reasons for this are discussed in relation to the somewhat different results in the Escherichia coli lambda phage system and in relation to error-prone repair and replication processes.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the simian virus 40 Hind-K restriction fragment.
AB  - The restriction fragment Hind-K represents 4.2% of the genome of Simian virus 40  (SV40) and is located near the middle of the late region. Its nucleotide sequence is reported here. It was mainly established by analysis of transcription products, synthesized by means of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase and nucleoside triphosphates, one of which was (alpha-32P)-labeled. Strand assignment was possible by hybridization of asymmetric, labeled transcripts of total SV40 DNA to filter-bound Hind-K fragment. Further information and unambiguous confirmation of the sequence was obtained by the use of direct DNA-sequencing methods. For this purpose the fragment was labeled at the 5' ends by means of polynucleotide kinase and [gamma-32P]ATP and redigested with a suitable restriction enzyme. The separated products were then either partially digested with snake venom diesterase for analysis by the 'wandering spot' method or partially degraded with the base-specific reagents dimethylsulphate or hydrazine for direct sequence analysis on gel. The Hind-K sequence is 219 base pairs long. The message strand is particularly rich in adenosine (39%) and purines. The nucleotide sequence cna unambiguously be translated into an amino acid sequence and the N-terminal codon of the viral protein VP1 gene could be identified. The amino-terminal part of VP1 is rich in proline and lysine. The nucleotide sequence of Hind-K codes also for the carboxyl-terminal part of the viral protein VP2 and VP3 genes, which partly overlap the VP1 gene.
TI  - Activity of azlocillin and mezlocillin against gram-negative organisms: comparison with other penicillins.
AB  - The activities of azlocillin and mezlocillin were compared with those of carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and pirbenicillin against a wide range of gram-negative organisms. The two new drugs were considerably more active than carbenicillin against Klebsiella species and Escherichia coli. Carbenicillin was twice as active against Proteus mirabilis as mezlocillin and four times as active as azlocillin. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, azlocillin was eight times as active as carbenicillin. Azlocillin and mezlocillin were twice as active as carbenicillin against Bacteroides fragilis, and these drugs showed a high degree of activity against Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
TI  - Mode of action of the Haemophilus bactericidal factor.
AB  - Haemocin, a bacteriocin produced by Haemophilus influenzae b, caused pronounced cell elongation of the sensitive strains H. influenzae Rd and Escherichia coli CR34 thyA. In the sensitive strains, haemocin markedly inhibited the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) but did not affect either ribonucleic acid or protein synthesis. The observed inhibition in synthesis of DNA was not due to degradation of preexisting DNA. The data suggest that haemocin may specifically inhibit DNA synthesis.
TI  - In vitro activity of piperacillin, a new semisynthetic penicillin with an unusually broad spectrum of activity.
AB  - The in vitro activity of piperacillin (T-1220), a new semisynthetic derivative of aminobenzylpenicillin, was investigated. The majority of streptococci and pneumococci were inhibited by 0.12 micrograms/ml; the staphylococci and enterococci were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. Piperacillin was slightly more active against Neisseria and Haemophilus influenzae than was ampicillin. Piperacillin was active against all members of the Enterobacteriaceae including the Klebsiella, 58% of which were inhibited by 8 micrograms/ml. The activity of piperacillin was at least equivalent, but generally superior, to that of ampicillin or carbenicillin on species susceptible to these drugs. Most striking was its activity on Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml, and 83% were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml. The minimum bactericidal concentrations were very close to the minimum inhibitory concentrations, and in most species only a slight inoculum effect was observed on the minimum bacterial values except for certain P. aeruginosa strains. A complete parallel resistance exists between piperacillin and ampicillin or carbenicillin. However, the clinical importance of this is largely mitigated by the intrinsically higher activity of piperacillin.
TI  - [Pleural empyema and Tauroflex. Study of a new bactericidal agent].
AB  - A pilot study of 8 cases of lung empyema treated with taurolin, a new bactericidal agent, is reported. Rapid sterilization of exudates and favorable clinical course are discussed. Thanks to the absence of toxicity and its bacteriological efficacy, taurolin is a useful therapeutic agent in pleural empyema. Its use in the prophylaxis of complications in thoracic surgery is suggested.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity in vitro of cefaclor, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefaclor, a new orally administered cephalosporin derivative, was studied in vitro against a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinical isolates. Both penicillin-resistant and penicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to cefaclor, with mean MICs of 1.44 and 0.93 microgram/ml, respectively. However, the MBC for penicillin-resistant S. aureus was higher than that for the penicillin-susceptible strains. All strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans, and Streptococcus pneumoniae tested were highly susceptible to cefaclor; all strains of Streptococcus faecalis were highly resistant to cefaclor. Strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus mirabilis, and Hemophilus influenzae were susceptible to cefaclor. Eighty per cent of strains of H. influenzae were inhibited by 5 micrograms/ml of cefaclor. Most strains of Enterobacter sp., indole-positive Proteus, Pseudomonas sp., and Serratia sp. were resistant to cefaclor.

TI  - Bacterial infections, sensitivity patterns, and chemotherapy among hospital patients in the tropics.
AB  - A prospective clinical and bacteriological review of the pattern of bacterial infections and chemotherapy among 1931 patients admitted to University College Hospital, Ibadan, between July and September, 1976, showed that 394 patients (20%) had bacterial infections, but 940 patients (49%) received antimicrobial chemotherapy. Thus 58% of the patients were treated either prophylactically or without bacteriological confirmation of infection. Infections of the respiratory tract were commonest (28%), followed closely by wound infections (26%). Septicaemia accounted for 20% of all infections and this was particularly common among children. There was a preponderance of infections due to gram-negative bacteria (69%), with Klebsiella spp. being the most frequently encountered. Among the gram-positive organisms, Staphylococcus aureus accounted for the majority of the infections, particularly infections of wounds, while Salmonellae were responsible for the majority of septicaemias, except among young children, where Klebsiella spp. were predominant. Approximately 90% of urinary tract infections were caused by Klebsiella, Escherichia coli and Proteus spp. Almost all the patients with meningitis were children (93%) and the commonest infecting organisms were Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The most commonly used antibiotics (penicillin, streptomycin and ampicillin) did not bear a close relationship to the sensitivity patterns of bacteria causing infections in the hospital. Comparison of the bacterial sensitivity patterns for 1963, 1967, 1974 and 1976 showed that the current usage of antibiotics had led over the years to increasing proportions of resistant organisms.
TI  - In vitro activity of netilmicin (SCH 20569) against bacterial isolates from ill children.
AB  - A new aminoglycoside antibiotic, netilmicin, was tested against 306 clinical isolates from ill children and compared with sisomicin and gentamicin. Activity against Enterobacteriaceae was similar to that of gentamicin but less than that of sisomicin. Two gentamicin-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae (Klebsiella, MIC 6.25 microgram/ml, Escherichia coli, MIC 12.5 microgram/ml) were susceptible to netilimicin (MIC 3.12 microgram/ml). Netilmicin was ineffective against almost all strains of Pseudomonas but active against the majority of strains of Staphylococcus, Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae tested. Disc diffusion sensitivity results correlated in general with the agar dilution test. Netilmicin had little activity against Pseudomonas but may be useful in the treatment of infections due to gentamicin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Therapy of serious infections with cefamandole.
AB  - Forty-four patients with serious bacterial infections were treated with cefamandole in a dose 1--2 g every four to six hours. Thirty-two patients were cured and six were markedly improved. Three of six failures were due to superinfection with cephalothin-resistant microorganisms. The over-all bacteriologic response was 80%. In 12 of 13 patients with bacteremia the blood was sterilized. Ten of 14 patients with gram-negative bacillary infections responded to treatment. Six of these were due to cephalothin-resistant microorganisms, three of which responded. Fifteen patients who were treated had a history of penicillin allergy. There were no serious reactions although skin rash did develop. Phlebitis was uncommon.

TI  - Qualitative study of paradoxical zone phenomenon of penicillins against 17 bacterial species of clinical importance.
AB  - Using a triple agar layer technique and enzymatic inactivation of penicillin, the occurrence of a paradoxical zone phenomenon (illustrated by a typical 'target' image around the reservoir of antibiotic) was determined for several bacterial species specially chosen with regards to their taxonomic position, clinical importance and penicillin susceptibility. Among gram-positive bacteria, a paradoxical zone was obtained for approximately 43% of the strains studied here (all 10 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, all 10 strains of Streptococcus faecalis, 7 of 10 strains of group B beta-hemolytic streptococci, 1 of 10 group A strains, 3 of 10 strains of alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 3 of 10 strains of Clostridium perfringens but for none of 10 strains each of Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Listeria monocytogenes). Among gram-negative bacteria, a target image was regularly obtained with Haemophilus influenzae (all 10 strains tested) and Proteus species (9 of 10 strains) but with none of the following species: Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis and Bacteroides fragilis. Therapeutic implications of these observations are difficult to assess, and need further investigation.
TI  - beta-lactamases and R-plasmids of Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The emergence of resistance to ampicillin and other antibiotics in Haemophilus influenzae has been a relatively recent event. In contrast, drug resistance has been rampant in the Enterobacteriaceae for many years. Ampicillin-resistance in H. influenzae is almost invariably attributable to possession of the TEM (Type III a)beta-lactamase. As is common in other bacteria the gene specifying this enzyme is plasmid-borne in Haemophilus. Some ampicillin-resistant strains of H. influenzae can transfer the TEM beta-lactamase gene to other strains of Haemophilus, to Escherichia coli and to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The features of such transfer are unusual and lead for example, to the induction of adenine requirement in recipient strains of P. aeruginosa. Crypticity measurements of beta-lactamase activity show that in comparison to P. aeruginosa or E. coli, the outer membrane of H. influenzae affords only a weak penetration barrier to beta-lactam antibiotics. This may have consequences for the stability and distribution of beta-lactamase production in Haemophilus spp. which are discussed. A comparison of the molecular properties of R-plasmids determining a variety of resistances and carried by strains of H. influenzae isolated in diverse geographical locations has revealed unexpected homologies. A series of such plasmids of similar molecular weights (about 30 X 10(6)) differ substantially only in the transposable resistance genes that they carry. A model based on these findings is presented to explain the acquisition of ampicillin- and other resistances by Haemophilus.
TI  - Prospects for the prevention of bacterial meningitis with polysaccharide vaccines.
AB  - MOST SUPPURATIVE INFECTIONS OF THE MENINGES ARE CAUSED BY FIVE BACTERIAL SPECIES: Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and group B streptococcus. The immune response of adults to pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides has been studied in great detail and their responses to meningococcal and H. influenzae type b capsular polysaccharides are quite similar. Immune responses of adults to E. coli and group B streptococcal antigens are disappointing. The responses of children below the age of 7 years differ both quantitatively and in duration. Early experience shows that useful antibody titres can be achieved with certain antigens but further studies are required. In order to prevent bacterial meningitis by immunization, three vaccine formulations will need to be developed. When epidemic meningococcal disease occurs in a population, the vaccine containing only components of the meningococcus would be applied to a large segment of the population to terminate the epidemic. The second vaccine would contain components of H. influenzae type b, pneumococcus, and the meningococcus and would be administered in the first year of life, and repeated at suitable intervals to maintain life-long immunity. The third vaccine, designed to prevent neonatal meningitis caused by E. coli K1 and group B streptococci, would be administered to women preferably during the third trimester of pregnancy, so that their offspring would inherit sufficient antibodies to protect them during the first 3 months of life.The vaccine against the meningococcus is a reality and has been used extensively during major epidemics, with excellent results. The two vaccines for control of endemic bacterial meningitides do not exist as yet, but the prospects are good.
TI  - The use of bacteria for the functional characterization of human lymphocyte subpopulations in various lymphoid organs.
AB  - In a haemolytic plaque assay staphylococcal strain Cowan 1 was shown to induce polyclonal antibody secretion in human blood lymphocytes, whereas Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli gave low responses. Diplococcus pneumoniae and haemolytic streptococci generally did not activate blood cells. All five bacteria could activate spleen, tonsil and adenoid cells both to polyclonal Ig secretion and increased DNA synthesis. Thus blood cell reactivity does not necessarily reflect the response pattern in other lymphatic organs. The adenoid was shown to contain lymphocytes more responsive to bacteria normally residing in nasopharynx than cells residing in other lymphatic organs. On the other hand, spleen and mesenteric lymph node contain a subpopulation of cells highly responsive to bacteria such as Escherichia coli normally residing in the bowel. Therefore, we conclude that there exists a functional compartmentalization of lymphocytes in distinct secondary lymphoid organs.
TI  - Effect of serum from various animal species on erythrocyte attachment of endotoxins and other bacterial antigens.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharide O antigens (endotoxins) and other bacterial antigens readily attach to erythrocytes in vitro. This attachment is prevented by certain mammalian and avian sera. In this study, the inhibitory capacity of sera from lower animals was compared with that of higher animals for a total of 30 species. Antigens and the corresponding antisera included both crude O antigens and purified lipopolysaccharide preparations, the common enterobacterial antigen from Escherichia coli O14, the Vi antigen from Citrobacter ballerup, the polyribose-phosphate antigen from Haemophilus influenzae type b, and the crude teichoic acid antigen from Staphylococcus aureus. Antigen and serum mixtures were incubated at 37 degrees C for 30 min and used for erythrocyte modification; failure of hemagglutination by homologous bacterial antiserum provided evidence of inhibitory capacity. Sera from the classes Mammalia and Aves were very strong inhibitors; those of Reptilia and Osteichthyes were moderate in activity, displaying variation within the classes; those of Amphibia and Chondrichthyes were minimal inhibitors; and those of Merostomata, Crustacea, and Lamellibranchiata displayed questionable or no inhibitory capacity. Inhibitory sera were active with all antigens tested. The findings suggest evolution of inhibitory factors consistent with the theory of two diverging lines of animal phylogeny based on embryological criteria and closely parallel the observations of an endotoxin-altering capacity in vertebrate sera that is not found in invertebrate sera or hemolymph.

TI  - Effect of heat on antigenicity and immunogenicity of the antigenic determinant shared by Haemophilus influenzae type b and Escherichia coli K100.
AB  - Escherichia coli K100 produces an antigenic determinant similar to, or identical  with, the capsular antigen of Haemophilus influenzae type b. Studies of the effects of heat on the immunogenicity, erythrocyte-modifying capacity, and antigenicity of this cross-reacting antigen (CRA) revealed the following findings. Immunization of rabbits with viable or formaldehyde-killed suspensions of E. coli K100, producing CRA, engendered CRA antibodies in significant titers, as demonstrated by hemagglutination of erythrocytes modified by H. influenzae type b antigen. Heating of the suspensions for 1 h at 56 or 100 degrees C destroyed the immunogenicity of CRA, and the heated suspensions did not prime for a secondary antibody response. Supernatants of heated suspensions also were non-immunogenic. Repeated freezing and thawing of heated suspensions of E. coli K100 or their supernatants did not restore immunogenicity. Heat also abolished the immunogenicity of H. influenzae type b. The loss of immunogenicity of CRA of E. coli K100 by heat was not due to alteration of the antigenic determinant, since heated suspensions and supernatants thereof modified erythrocytes for agglutination by H. influenzae type b antiserum. The latter supernatants also inhibited hemagglutination by H. influenzae type b antibodies and absorbed the latter. We conclude that striking differences exist in the effects of heat on CRA on the one hand and of enterobacterial common antigen and lipopolysaccharide O antigen of enteric bacteria on the other. Heating of the latter two antigens does not abolish their priming effect, and repeated freezing and thawing restores the immunogenicity of heated antigens.

TI  - Molecular characterization of two beta-lactamase-specifying plasmids isolated from Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  - The molecular nature of two distinct gonococcal R plasmids, 4.4 X 10(6) and 3.2 X 10(6) daltons, encoding beta-lactamase activity were examined. Both plasmids contained about 40% of the transposable ampicillin resistance sequence Tn2. Deoxyribonucleic acid-deoxyribonucleic acid polynucleotide sequence studies have shown that the two gonococcal plasmids share about 70% of their sequences and are closely related to RSF0885, a 4.1 X 10(6)-dalton plasmid found in a beta-lactamase-producing strain of Haemophilus influenzae. All three of these R plasmids possess a guanine-plus-cytosine content of 0.40 to 0.41 mol fraction and are present as multicopy gene pools in their bacterial hosts.
TI  - The infant rat as a model of bacterial meningitis.
AB  - The pathogenesis of bacterial meningitis was studied in infant rats. Intranasal intoculation of greater than 10(3) Haemophilus influenzae type b resulted in an incidence of bacteremia that was directly related to the size of hte challenge inoculum. The temporal and quantitative relationship of bacteremia to meningitis indicated that bacteria spread to the meninges by the hematogenous route and that the magnitude of bacteremia was a primary determinant in the development of meningitis. In a sparate series of experiments, infant rats that were fed Escherichia coli strain C94 (O7:K1:H-) became colonized and developed bacteremia and meningitis, but invasive disease was rare when rats were fed E. Coli strain Easter (O75:K100:H5). A comparison of intranasal vs. oral challenge indicated that the nasopharynx was the most effective route for inducing H. influenzae bacteremia, whereas the gastrointestinal route was the more effective challenge route for the E. coli K1 serotype.
TI  - Attempts to induce mutations in Haemophilus influenzae with the base analogues 5-bromodeoxyuridine and 2-aminopurine.
AB  - Attempts were made to induce mutations in Haemophilus influenzae with the base analogues 5-bromodeoxyuridine and 2-aminopurine. These attempts were unsuccessful. Incorporation studies with BrdUrd showed, in agreement with earlier studies on Escherichia coli, that BrdUrd was discriminated against when dThd was also present but was incorporated to essentially the same extent as dThd when only BrdUrd was present. In this latter case, strands fully substituted with BrdUrd was produced, but survival data suggest that bacteria deriving their DNA by replication on such fully substituted templates were inviable. However, bacteria with about 20% of the thymine substituted with bromouracil were usually viable. No mutations could be detected in the descendants of such bacteria. The reasons for this are discussed and it is concluded that in all probability the replication system in species rarely if every treats incorporated bromouracil as anything except a thymine analogue. The alternative possibility, that the negative results are a consequence of the absence of the reclex (SOS) error-prone repair system in this species, is considered much less likely.
TI  - Evidence that UV-inducible error-prone repair is absent in Haemophilus influenzae Rd, with a discussion of the relation to error-prone repair of alkylating-agent damage.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae Rd and its derivatives are mutated either not at all or to only a very small extent by ultraviolet (UV) radiation, X-rays, methyl methanesulfonate, and nitrogen mustard, though they are readily mutated by such agents as N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, ethyl methanesulfonate, and nitrosocarbaryl. In these respects H. influenzae Rd resembles the lexA mutants of Escherichia coli that lack the SOS or reclex UV-inducible error-prone repair system. This similarity is further brought out by the observation that chloramphenicol has little or no effect on post-replication repair after UV irradiation. In E. coli, chloramphenicol has been reported to considerably inhibit post-replication repair in the wild type but not in the lexA mutant. Earlier work has suggested that most or all the mutations induced in H. influenzae by NC result from error-prone repair. Combined treatment with NC and either X-rays or UV shows that the NC error-prone repair system does not produce mutations from the lesions induced by these radiations even while it is producing them from its own lesions. It is concluded that the NC error-prone repair system or systems and the reclex error-prone system are different.

TI  - Effect of neonatal gastrointestinal colonization with cross reacting Escherichia  coli on anticapsular antibody production and bacteremia in experimental Haemophilus influenzae type b disease of rats.
AB  - Neonatal gastrointestinal colonization of newborn rats with Escherichia coli 075:K100:H5, cross-reactive with the capsular polysaccharide of Haemophilus influenzae type b, was harmless but failed to stimulated detectable ( greater than 200 ng/ml) serum anticapsular antibodies. Neonatally colonized rats, when challenged at age 13 weeks by intraperitoneal inoculation of H. influenzae b, showed no difference in the frequency, magnitude, or duration of bacteremia or in the postinfection anticapsular antibody response when compared with saline-fed controls. However, neonatally colonized rats challenged at age 4 weeks had a significantly decreased incidence of sustained bacteremia and/or endophthalmitis when compared with controls. This decreased frequency of disease correlated with a significant increase in postinfection serum anticapsular antibodies. Neonatal gastrointestinal colonization with cross-reacting E. coli appears to "prime" the young host to respond to infection with H. influenzae b with an anticapsular antibody response that protects against sustained H. influenzae b bacteremia and its complications.

AB  - The results of 6,951 blood cultures taken from hospitalized children are reviewed. One or more organisms grew from 6% (399) of the cultures, of which 189 (two thirds) were considered to represent confirmed bacteremia. The most common organisms associated with bacteremia were Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacteriaceae, and Staphylococcus aureus. Patients with deficient host defenses (newborns, oncology patients) with bacteremia had a higher mortality than normal children. Laboratory techniques allowing more rapid detection of positive blood cultures resulted in major alterations in therapy in almost one half of all bacteremic patients.

AB  - From June 1973 to July 1976, 742 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and parainfluenzae, isolated from clinical specimens, were routinely tested for in vitro sensitivity to twelve antibiotics: penicillin, ampicillin, cephalothin, streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, tetracyclin, minocyclin, erythromycin, sulfamethoxazol, trimethoprim. 61 strains were found resistant to one or more of these antibiotics (ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol and tetracyclin). The MICs of 23 antibiotics were determined by the agar dilution method on most of the resistant strains and on 60 sensitive strains isolated during the same period and considered as control. 21 strains transferred their resistance determinants into E. coli K12; 23 plasmids were obtained isolated from these strains: 2 strains contained two different plasmids. 90% of the transconjugants were stable after repeated subcultures.
TI  - A complete cleavage map of Neurospora crassa mtDNA obtained with endonucleases Eco RI and Bam HI.
AB  - A physical map of Neurospora crassa mitochondrial DNA has been constructed using  specific fragments obtained with restriction endonucleases. The DNA has 5 cleavage sites for endonuclease Bam HI, 12 for endonuclease Eco RI and more than 30 for endonuclease Hind III. The sequence of the Eco RI and Bam HI fragments has been established by analysis of partial fragments. By digestion of the Eco RI fragments with Bam HI, a complete overlapping map has been constructed. The position of the largest Hind III fragment on this map has also been determined. The map is circular and the added molecular weight of the fragments is 40 - 10(6), which is in good agreement with earlier measurements on intact DNA, using the electron microscope.
TI  - Positions of sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) histone genes relative to restriction endonuclease sites on the chimeric plasmids pSp2 and pSp17.
AB  - The positions of the several sea urchin histone genes on the eukaryotic fragments of the chimeric plasmids pSp2 and pSp17 have been mapped relative to the Eco RI and Hind III restriction endonuclease sites on the plasmids. Two principal mapping methods using the electron microscope have been used: (a) the R-loop procedure and a new modification thereof to map the genes on duplex DNA; (b) the gene 32-ethidium bromide technique to visualize RNA-DNA hybrids on single strands of DNA. It is known that there are two histone genes, H3 and H2A, on pSp17. There are two Eco RI sites at the two junctions of the procaryotic segment with the eucaryotic segment on the plasmid. We show, by an electron microscope method, that for H2A, with a length of 0.52 kilobases (kb), one end of the gene is situated 0.02 to 0.03 kb from one RI site, and that there is a Hind III site within this gene at about 0.13 kb from the end phe other RI site of this plasmid. The H4 gene lies between H2B and H1. The ms the incubation temperature is raised up to a temperature just below that at which strand dissociation of the duplex DNA occurs.
TI  - Screening for cross-reacting capsular polysaccharide K antigens of Escherichia coli using antiserum agar.
AB  - Agar plates containing antiserum against group B meningococcus or Haemophilus influenzae type b were used to determine the prevalence of cross-reacting K1 and K100 capsular polysaccharide antigens in 265 isolates of disease-causing Escherichia coli. K1 antigen was found in 22% of isolates from various sites. K100 antigen was found in only three isolates. This technique is a convenient method to detect specific E. coli K antigens for evaluation as possible factors important in the virulence of the organism.
TI  - Analysis of the alpha-satellite DNA from African green monkey cells by restriction nucleases.
AB  - By the use of restriction endonucleases the organization of the alpha-satellite DNA from African green monkey cells (Cercopithecus aethiops) has been analyzed. With endo R-HindIII, endo R-AluI and with endo R-EcoRI at conditions of low salt and high pH (endo R-EcoRI) all of the satellite was digested while only a part of the satellite was cleaved with endo R-Bsu and endo R-EcoRI under standard conditions. With each of the four nucleases a series of fragments was formed which were multiplies in size of a basic repeat unit linked in tandem arrays in the intact satellite. The quantitative evaluation of the digestion with each nuclease as well as with combinations of two nucleases yielded information about the distribution of the cleavage sites. While the arrangement of the endo R-HindIII cleavage sites conforms to a random distribution across the entire satellite, the results from the endo R-Bsu and endo R-EcoRI cleavage patterns are consistent with a picture where the cleavage sites are clustered in fractions of the satellite. Since endo R-AluI recognizes the central four nucleotide pairs of the endo R-HindIII cleavage site, the redigestion of the endo R-HindIII dimer with endo R-AluI gave information about the distribution of mutations in the satellite. The results of these experiments together with the comparison of the sequence divergence determined from digestion with endo R-HindIII and endo R-EcoRI lend support to the hypothesis that mutations have affected all bases in the satellite evenly. The gamma-satellite, another fraction of the African green monkey DNA, could be separated by Ag+/CsSO4 density gradient centrifugation into two components. With the three restriction nucleases used both components gave a background of fragments of heterogenous length on gel electrophoresis with some faint bands of no apparent regularity in one case.
TI  - Sepsis and congenital asplenia.
AB  - Fifty-nine children with congenital asplenia were reviewed for episodes of severe infection. Seven children had isolated asplenia and 52 had asplenia associated with complex congenital heart disease (asplenia syndrome). A control group of eusplenic children with comparable cardiac lesions were assembled and used for comparative statistical analysis. There were 16 instances of documented sepsis among 59 children (27%). In those less than six months of age, the invading organism was usually gram-negative (Escherichia coli or Klebsiella). In children six months of age or older, the infecting organism was usually a pneumococcus or H. influenzae. When those with asplenia syndrome were compared to the control population, the former group had a significantly greater incidence of sepsis. Children with asplenia syndrome who survived the first month of life were at greater risk of dying from sepsis than from their heart disease. It is recommended that prophylactic antibiotics be administered to children with congenital absence of the spleen, commencing at three months of age, to be continued indefinitely.
TI  - Bactericidal factor produced by Haemophilus influenzae b: partial purification of the factor and transfer of its genetic determinant.
AB  - When aerobically grown on complex media, Haemophilus influenzae b and unencapsulated variants, Rb strains, produced a bactericidal factor that was active against other Haemophilus species and certain genera of the Enterobacteriaceae. A total of 341 clinical isolates of Haemophilus were tested for susceptibility to the factor. Ninety-three percent of H. influenzae (nontypable), 75% of H. haemolyticus, 71% of H. parainfluenzae, and 22% of H. parahaemolyticus were susceptible. H. influenaze b strains were resistant producers of the bactericidal factor and H. influenzae f strains were susceptible nonproducers. Only one strain each of H. aegyptius and H. aphrophilus was isolated and each was susceptible and resistant, respectively. 143 clinical isolates of the Enterobacteriaceae were tested and of those 82% of Escherichia coli, 85% of Salmonella sp., and all Citrobacter sp., Shigella sp., and Yersinia sp. were sensitive to the bactericidal factor produced by H. influenzae b. Attempts to isolate the bactericidal activity from mechanically disrupted, solubilized, or osmotically shocked cells failed to release active bactericidal factor. However, we partially purified the bactericidal factor from the spent culture medium of aerobically grown H. influenzae b by a series of extractions. The ability to produce the bactericidal factor was transferable to nonproducer strains without also genetically transforming for type b encapsulation. The converse was also true in that type b capsules were produced by transformed H. influenzae Rd strains but no bactericidal factor was detected from these strains. Additionally, nitrosoguanidine-induced mutants of H. influenzae b lost the ability to produce bactericidal factor without loss of their type-specific capsule, demonstrating that production of the bactericidal factor was genetically separable from production of the type capsule of H. influenzae b.
TI  - Counterimmunoelectrophoresis in the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate whether counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE) would facilitate the rapid, etiological diagnosis of bacterial meningitis when used in parallel with other routine methods in a medical bacteriological laboratory. Of 3,674 consecutive specimens of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) received at the Department of Diagnostic Bacteriology, Statens Seruminstitu, 283 specimens (each representing one patient) were selected for examination by CIE on the basis of the following criteria: bacteria or pleocytosis or both by microscopy or positive culture or both. CIE was performed with antisera to Neisseria meningitidis (groups A, B and C), Streptococcus pneumoniae (omni-serum and pools A to 1), and Haemophilus influenzae type b. Antigen was detected in 57% (72/126) of specimens in which cultures revealed these three kinds of microorganisms in CSF and in 12% (17/139) of the culture-negative specimens. CSF specimens from 21 patients with bacterial meningitis caused by other species were all negative in CIE, except four, three of which contained Escherichia coli antigen reacting with antiserum to N. meningitidis group B and one E. coli antigen reacting with antiserum to H. influenzae type b. Specific diagnosis was achieved in 60% (170/283) of the specimens studied and could be extablished within 1 h in 85% (145/170) by the combined results of microscopy and CIE. Ten specimens, nine of which showed a reaction with antiserum to N. meningitidis group A, were positive by CIE only.
TI  - Frequency of E. coli K antigens in urinary-tract infections in children.
AB  - The somatic (O) and casular (K) antigens of Escherichia coli from the urine of patients with acute pyelonephritis, acute cystitis, and asymptomatic bacteriuria, and in the faeces of healthy schoolchildren have been investigated. Typing antisera for sixteen capsular acidic polysaccharide K antigens were used, and five (numbers 1, 2, 3, 12, and 13) accounted for 70% of isolates from patients with acute pyelonephritis. These five K antigens were found to a lesser extent in the three other study groups. Thus, only a few K polysaccharides are associated with virulent properties of E. coli for the upper urinary tract. This finding is similar to the association of only some capsular types of pneumococci, meningococci, and Haemophilus influenzae with invasiveness. The identification of virulence markers for E. coli associated with upper-urinary-tract disease may permit more successful control with reference to preventive immunisation.
TI  - Interaction of RNA polymerase with promoters from bacteriophage fd.
AB  - Replicative form DNA of bacteriophage fd, which had been fragmented with the restriction endonuclease II from Hemophilus parainfluenzae (endo R- HpaII), was reacted with Escherichia coli RNA polymerase; the resulting stable preinitiation complexes were analysed using the filter binding assay followed by gel electrophoresis. At 120mM KCL the first-order rate constants for complex decay were determined to be 10(-2)-10(-6)s-1. The second-order rate constants for complex formation were found to be about 10(6) -10(7) M-1 s-1. From these values association constants for the individual promoters were calculated to be 2 x 10(-8) -2 x 10(-11) M-1. The rate of formation and the stability of promoter complexes was enhanced in superhelical DNA. No evidence was found for stable promoter-specific closed complexes consisting of enzyme and helical DNA. This and the kinetic data suggest that the unwinding of base pairs is already important early in promoter selection, and not only for the formation of the final open complex. The initiation of RNA synthesis form the preinitiation complex was faster than complex dissociation and complex formation for all promoters. Consequently, the initiation efficiency of a promoter is determined by the rate of complex formation, and not by its 'affinity' for the enzyme. No correlation was found between the relative order of the fd promoters for the binding and the dissociation reaction. This is explained by different structural determinants, for the two reactions, which are located in different parts of the promoter DNA.
TI  - Comparative analysis of three guinea pig satellite DNA's by restriction nucleases.
AB  - The structures of guinea pig satellite DNAs I, II, and III have been analyzed by  digestion with seven restriction nucleases. From the cleavage patterns it is obvious that the long-range periodicities in these three satellites differ rather characteristically Satellite I is fairly resistant to six nucleases and gives only a number of weak discrete bands which do not show a simple regularity. By the restriction nuclease from Arthrobacter luteus, however, it is cleaved extensively and yields very heterogeneous breakdown products. This is consistent with the high extent of divergence previously found for this satellite, e. g. by sequence analysis. Satellite II is almost completely resistant to all nucleases, indicative of a high degree of sequence homogeneity of this satellite. Satellite III is completely broken by the restriction nuclease from Bacillus subtilis into fragments which form a novel, highly regular series of bands in gel electrophoresis. The patterns show that the satellite is composed of tandem repeats ofapproximately 215 nucleotide pairs length, each repeat unit containing two cleavage sites for this nuclease. The data are consistent with the assumption that 30--40% of all cleavage sites have been eliminated by a random process. Satellite III DNA yields weak degradation patterns of the same periodicity with a number of other restriction nucleases. Cleavage sites for these nuclease are clustered on separatesmall segments of the satellite DNA. In this respect, the satellite is similar to others, notably the mouse satellite DNA. The three guinea pig satellites are examples of more general types of satellite structures also found in othe organisms. Similarities and differences to other satellites are discussed with special consideration to theories on the evolution of this class of DNA.
TI  - Cephalothin prophylaxis in cardiac valve surgery. A prospective, double-blind comparison of two-day and six-day regimens.
AB  - A prospective, double-blind study comparing a 6 day with a 2 day regimen of cephalothin prophylaxis was conducted among 200 patients undergoing prosthetic valve replacement. No cases of endocarditis occurred during the 2 month follow-up. Sternal wound infection developed in 2.8 per cent of the 6 day group and 2.1 per cent of the 2 day group. Pneumonia developed in 8.5 per cent of the 6 day and 5.3 per cent of the 2 day group; most of the bacteria isolated were susceptible to cephalothin. Urinary tract infection developed more frequently in the 2 day group (17.0 versus 8.5 per cent), particularly during the first 6 postoperative days. Three of 11 patients with no detectable cephalothin in their sera at the close of operation developed staphylococcal wound infections, compared with 2 of 175 patients whose sera contained cephalothin at the close of surgery (p = 0.002, Fisher's exact test). A short course of prophylactic antibiotics is prudent, but there is no justification for prolonging their administration.
TI  - Plasmid-mediated chloramphenicol resistance in Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - A clinical isolate of Haemophilus influenzae HC234 was found to be resistant to chloramphenicol and tetracycline. It was shown that both resistance markers are tranferable as one unit to other Haemophilus influenzae strains and also to Escherichia coli. Data are presented which indicate that conjugation is the most likely mechanism of resistance transfer. HC234 was shown to carry a single plasmid species with a molecular weight of 38 x 10(6).

TI  - Characterization of distinct segments in mouse satellite DNA by restriction nucleases.
AB  - The long-range periodicity of mouse satellite DNA has been analyzed by digestion  with five restriction nucleases. With all nucleases tested, a major repeat unit approximately 245 nucleotide pairs became apparent. Minor registers of shorter length were also detected. The total number of cleavage sites per haploid genome for each restriction enzyme as well as their positions relative to each other were determined. While endo R-EcoRII was known to cleave all of the satellite DNA, the other four restriction enzymes were found to generate only weak degradation patterns. The results taken together with quantitative analyses of codigestion experiments indicate that the recognition sequences for each of these four nucleases are clustered on separate parts of the satellite DNA. It is concluded that the satellite DNA, which appears homogeneous by digestion with endo R-EcRII, contains distinct segments each susceptible to degradation with one of the other nucleases. These results have certain implications for theories on the evolution of mouse satellite DNA. A simple mechanism of multiplication and divergence by mutation is not sufficient to explain the data. Additional and alternative processes which are relevant to the evolutionary considerations are discussed.
TI  - Comparison of in vitro activity of cephalexin, cephradine, and cefaclor.
AB  - Inhibitory activity of cephalexin, cephradine, and cefaclor was compared by the WHO-ICS agar dilution technique. Cefaclor was substantially more active against staphylococci, streptococci, gonococci, meningococci, Haemophilus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, salmonellae, and shigellae than was cephalexin, which in turn was more active than cephradine. Cefaclor appeared to be less resistant to staphylococcal penicillinase than did the other two agents. None of these cephalosporins was active against Enterobacter, Serratia, indole-positive Proteeae, Pseudomonas, or Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - Heterologous transfection with bacteriophage phiX174 DNA. Unusual heterogeneous products.
AB  - Hydroxylamine-resistant infectious materials (HARIM) synthesized in natural non-host and progeny phage low productive bacterial spheroplasts upon transfection with bacteriophage phiX174 DNA were found to be unusually heterogeneous in their forms. Using Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a source of HARIM, it was shown that they have the following unusual features. (1) Almost all of the HARIM are denser than normal single-stranded (SS)- and double-stranded replicative form (RF)-DNAs of phiX174 found usually in the phage-infected host cells. (2) A great part of these heavy HARIM (approximately 84%) contain a variable length of single-stranded RNA associated with their infectious elements. (3) For most of the HARIM (approximately 80% of total molecules as the infectious elements of the heavy HARIM), the infectious elements are phiX-RFI-DNA. The wide-spread system for phiX-HARIM synthesis was shown to be present in many gram-negative bacterial cells.
TI  - Transfer of a plasmid-specified beta-lactamase gene from Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - A number of ampicillin-resistant strains of Haemophilus influenzae could donate a gene specifying the type IIIa (TEM) beta-lactamase to Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Donor strains rapidly lost their ability to transfer ampicillin resistance on storage or subculture. Such strains also apparently contained a single species of covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid of contour length 1.2 mum, equivalent to about 2.5 x 10(6) daltons. No species of plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid large enough to encode sex factor activity was detected. Despite this, transfer occurred to several bacterial genera in the presence of deoxyribonuclease, suggesting that transmissibility was by conjugation. The beta-lactamase gene was generally unstable after transfer and was lost in the absence of selection. Where stable transcipients were found, this was evidently by insertion of the beta-lactamase gene into the host chromosome. In P. aeruginosa insertion was always accompanied by induction of auxotrophy for adenine, suggesting insertion at a specific site. It is believed that insertion also occurred at one site on the chromosome of Escherichia coli. Crypticity measurements for beta-lactamase activity showed that there was little or no penetration barrier to beta-lactam drugs in Haemophilus. This may explain the long delay in the acquisition of ampicillin resistance by this organism.
TI  - Meningitis due to two serotypes of Escherichia coli. An infant who recovered.
AB  - A newborn infant with hyaline membrane disease and aspiration pneumonia developed purulent meningitis on day 19, three days after discontinuation of ampicillin sodium and gentamicin sulfate therapy. Therapy with gentamicin, both systemically and intrathecally, for two weeks was ineffective. During this time each of four specimens of cerebrospinal fluid contained two serotypes of Escherichia coli, namely, O83:H4 and O75:H5. The antibiograms of the two strains were identical, both being susceptible to gentamicin and ampicillin. Treatment with ampicillin resulted in prompt disappearance of the infecting microorganisms and recovery from the infection. One of the strains (O75:H5) produced an antigen cross-reacting with the capsular antigen of Haemophilus influenzae type B; the other did not. The patient developed O antibodies in substantial titers against E coli O83 but not against E coli O75.
TI  - Immunoprotective activity of ribosomes from Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Immunization with ribosomal preparations from Haemophilus influenzae type b elicited protective immunity in mice. Ribosomes from disrupted cells where isolated by differential centrifugation using sodium dodecyl sulfate. The washed ribosomes contained 25% protein and 75% ribonucleic acid and sedimented as a single peak on sucrose density gradient analysis with a sedimentation coefficient of 67S, using Escherichia coli ribosomes as a 70S marker. Immunodiffusion tests with antipolyribose phosphate serum showed that the ribosomes were free from capsular material. Mice immunized subcutaneously with ribosomes, with or without adjuvant, were challenged intraperitoneally with 100 to 1,000 mean lethal doses of H. influenzae type b suspended in gastric mucin. Significant protection was induced by ribosomes and was compared to that obtained after sublethal infection with live cells. The protection was greatly enhanced after incorporation of ribosomes into adjuvants. Maximum protection (90 to 95%) was observed at 1 to 2 weeks after immunization. Ribosomes from a nonencapsulated strain of H. influenzae were as immunogenic as those from the encapsulated strain, demonstrating that the capsular material is not responsible for immunogenicity of Haemophilus ribosomes.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of a fragment of SV40 DNA that contains the origin of DNA replication and specifies the 5' ends of "early" and "late" viral RNA. IV. Localization of the SV40 DNA complementary to the 5' ends of viral mRNA.
AB  - Cytoplasmic mRNA isolated from cells infected with SV40 was isolated by passage over oligo(dT)-cellulose columns. This RNA was annealed to SV40 DNA fragments produced by cleavage with EcoRII endonuclease. The RNA resistant to RNase digestion was analyzed by digestion with ribonucleases and oligonucleotide mapping. The results were compared with oligonucleotides from in vitro transcripts of the fragments and with whole genome SV40 cRNA which had been fractionated by hybridization to the fragments. The 5' ends of "early" and the large "late" SV40 mRNA, transcribed from opposite DNA strands, overlap for a region of 60 to 100 nucleotides. The region of overlap includes a portion of the segment of DNA containing the origin of DNA replication.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of a fragment of SV40 DNA that contains the origin of DNA replication and specifies the 5' ends of "early" and "late" viral RNA. III. Construction of the total sequence of EcoRII-G fragment of SV40 DNA.
AB  - Limited T1 RNase digestion of subfragments of the SV40 DNA restriction endonuclease fragment EcoRII-G were prepared and analyzed. The fragments were separately labeled with 32P at their 5' terminus and the terminal sequences analyzed with limited snake venom diesterase digestion. The data permitted us to deduce the nucleotide sequence for EcoRII-G. The sequence contains a stretch of 17 A-T base pairs preceding the DNA complementary to the 5' end of "early" message RNA, a stretch of 27 bases with a perfect 2-fold rotational symmetry near the origin of DNA replication and a perfect tandem repeat of 21 nucleotides.

TI  - The restriction endonuclease cleavage map of rat liver mitochondrial DNA.
AB  - Mitochondrial DNA from rat liver contains six sites for cleavage by the restriction endonucleases Hind III and EcoRI. A large stretch of DNA, comprising about 40% of the mitochondrial genome is not cleaved by either of the enzymes; eight cleavage sites are located on a DNA stretch of 35% of the genome length suggestive of an unequal distribution of the A - T baspairs over the molecule. The number of Hind III and Eco R I fragments is much higher than reported for other mammalian mitochondrial DNAs up to now.
TI  - Occurrence and transfer of ampicillin resistance associated with ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae isolated from a case at a day-care centre.
AB  - A 1-year-old boy with recurrent otitis media had been repeatedly treated with antibiotics. A few days after withdrawal of administered ampicillin he again contracted otitis media and ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae was isolated. The strain was serologically untypable. No ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae was found in his family or at the day-care centre that he attended. The ability to produce the beta-lactamase elaborated from this strain could be transferred to ampicillin-sensitive strains of H. influenzae and Escherichia coli in frequencies of 0.7 X 10(-7) and 4.1 X 10(-4) respectively. The transcipients obtained were ampicillin-resistant and beta-lactamase producing. In the transcipients of E. coli, however, the marker for ampicillin resistance was quite unstable.
TI  - Separation of the complementary strands of DNA fragments on polyacrylamide gels.
AB  - 32P-labeled (in vivo) phiX174 RFI DNA was restricted by Hinc II. Three aliquots of the same digest: a) nondenatured, b) heat denatured, and c) denatured by 5 mM Me-HgOH were analyzed on 3-15% acrylamide gel gradients or on 3% gels with reduced N,N'-methylene-bis-acrylamide. The autoradiography of the gels showed that the nondenatured sample migrates two times faster than the denatured samples. After denaturation each original fragment appeared as a doublet. Using in vitro synthesized RFI DNA labeled only in negative strand with 32P we could identify the position of the negative strand in each denatured doublet. The single strand DNA fragments could be recovered from the gel slices on a semi-preparative scale by electrophoresis into dialysis tubing.
TI  - Restriction endonuclease cleavage maps of rat and mouse mitochondrial DNAs.
AB  - Mitochondrial DNA from an Old World mouse, Mus musculus, and from an Old World rat, Rattus norvegicus, contain 19 and 22 distinct sites, respectively, for the 8 restriction endonucleases, BamHI, EcoRI, HaeII, HhaI, HincII, HindIII, HpaI and PstI. The relative positions of the sites have been mapped by the study of partial and double enzyme digests. Some sites may been conserverd between the mouse and rat mitochondrial genomes.
TI  - A restriction endonuclease cleavage map of mouse mitochondrial DNA.
AB  - A restriction endonuclease cleavage map is presented for mouse mitochondrial DNA. This map was constructed by electron microscopic measurements on partial digests containing fixed D-loops, and by electrophoretic analysis of partial and complete single enzyme digests, and of double digests. No map differences were detected between mitochondrial DNA from cultured LA9 cells and an inbred mouse line for the six endonucleases used. Three cleavage sites recognized by HpaI, five sites recognized by HincII, two sites recognized PstI and four sites recognized by BamI were located with respect to the origin of replication and the EcoRI and HinIII sites previously determined by others. No cleavages were produced by KpnI or SalI. The migration of linear DNA with a molecular weight greater than 1 X 10(6) was not a linear function of log molecular weight in 1% agarose gels run at 6.6 volts/cm.

TI  - Development of a lysis-filtration blood culture technique.
AB  - A lysed-blood culture system that quickly lyses patients' blood near neutrality and is relatively noninjurious to more delicate pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae and Bacteroides fragilis is reported. The lysing solution includes culture medium, 0.004 M sodium carbonate and bicarbonate, 0.04% Triton X-100,and 0.6% Rhozyme (a mixture of proteases). Most of the pathogens tested multiplied in the lysing solution. The lysed blood normally is immediately filtered. The membrane is transferred to culture broth. The greatest advantage realized from this blood culture technique is separation of pathogens from antibiotics, bactericidal antibodies, complement, opsonins, and phagocytic systems. Another advantage is the concentration of organisms into a small volume of clear medium for faster growth and visualization of growth. It was observed that both gram-negative and -positive organisms were attracted during filtration to the filter material and were not removed from it by backwashing with buffer. Thus, filter membranes with porosities much larger than would nominally be expected to retain bacteria retained all or part of light and heavy Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus suspensions. Advantage may be taken of this phenomenon to use filters with larger pore sizes and avoid filter clogging by poorly lysed specimens. Porr lysis may result from addition of too much blood to the lysing solution, blood with elevated numbers of erythrocytes or leukocytes, or blood from some people whose blood is naturally more resistant to lysis.

Characterization of genetic determinants and basic enzymes of the recombination process in Rec-systems of different bacteria. 3.

TI  - Physicochomecial studies on interactions between DNA and RNA polymerase. Isolation and mapping of a T7 DNA fragment containing the early promoters for Escherichia coli RNA polymerase.
AB  - The cleavage sites in the early promoter region of coliphage T7 have been mapped  for four restriction enzymes. They are, from the left end in base pairs, 1100 and 740 for Hinf; 680, 320, 530, 240, 77, and 67 for Hind II; 620 and 530 for Hpa II; 790 for Alu I. The nucleotide sequence between the Hind II site at 680 base pairs from the left end and the Hinf site at 740 base pairs from the left end has been determined, from which the start point of the promoter A3 is located at 720 base pairs from the left end. The start points of the other two major promoters A1 and A2 are deduced to be at 460 and 580 base pairs from the left end, respectively, from the chain lengths of the in vitro transcripts off the 1100 base-pairs long Hinf fragment. Similar to the sequences of a pL and pR promotors of phage lambda and a sequence in Simian Virus 40 used by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase as a promotor, the sequence of the A3 promotor of T7 also has a Hind II restriction site approximately 30 base pairs upstream to the start point of RNA synthesis. No such Hind II sites exist, however, for the A1 and A2 promoters. Experiments on the protection of some of the restriction sites on the 1100 base-pairs-long Hinf fragment by RNA polymerase binding support the electron microscopic observations of others that, in addition to the three sites A1, A2 and A3, there is at least a fourth site at which E. coli RNA polymerase can bind strongly. In addition to the Hind II site at 680 base pairs from the left end and the Hinf site at 740 base pairs from the left end, which are presumably protected by the binding of a single RNA polymerase at the A3 site, the Hind II site at 240 base pairs from the left end is also protected at a level of 5 polymerase molecules/DNA fragment. The possible existence of several minor promotor sites in the early promotor region, in addition to the three major promotor sites, is discussed.

TI  - Effect of adenosine 5'-triphosphate-dependent deoxyribonuclease deficiency on properties and transformation of Haemophilus influenzae strains.
AB  - A transformation-deficient strain of Haemophilus influenzae, lacking adenosine 5'-triphosphate-dependent deoxyribonuclease activity, was isolated by selection for sensitivity to mitomycin. The mutant, designated JK57, possibily showed a moderate sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and treatment with methyl methane sulfonate. Contrary to the wild type, the mutant degraded chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to some extent. However, after UV irradiation to the mutant degraded considerably less DNA than the wild type and the TD24 mutant of H. influenzae, the latter being equivalent to a recA mutant of Escherichia coli. A TD2457 double mutant, constructed by transferring the TD24 mutation into the JK57 strain, was as sensitive to deleterious agents and as deficient in transformation as the TD24 single mutant; in the double mutant, however, after UV irradiation chromosomal DNA was degraded to the same extent as in the JK57 mutant. The number of transformants per unit of radioactive donor DNA taken up by JK57 recipient cells was approximately 10-fold smaller than in the wild type. Presynaptically, the fate of donor DNA in the adenosine 5'-triphosphate-dependent deoxyribonuclease-deficient mutants was not different from that in the wild type. In contrast to TD24 and the TD2457 double mutant, in the JK57 mutant, recombinant-type activities (molecules carrying both the donor and recipient markers) were formed almost as well as in the wild type. After integration into the JK57 recipient genome, the rate of replication of the donor marker was equal to that of the recipient marker during a number of generations, which suggests that the donor DNA is normally integrated into the JK57 chromosome. It is suggested that transformed JK57 cells pass with a high frequency into a type of cells that can replicate their chromosomes many times but have lost the ability to form visible colonies after plating.
TI  - Cefamandole: in vitro and clinical pharmacokinetics.
AB  - Cefamandole has a broader spectrum and greater potency than the other cephalosporins. It includes Haemophilus influenzae, most strains of Enterobacter, and many strains of indole-positive Proteus and Bacteroides, with a lower minimal inhibitory concentration for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, etc. Concentrations of drug in the serum after the parenteral injection of cefamandole exceed manyfold the minimal inhibitory concentrations of over 82% of the bacteria studied. Approximately 65 to 85% is excreted in a biologically active form in the urine. This antibiotic offers advantages of antibacterial effectiveness and at the same time retains the safety of penicillin G and cephalothin in animals.
TI  - Repeating restriction fragments of human DNA.
AB  - Human DNA digested with Hae III showed multiple repeats of a 170 base pair fragment. The most prominent band was the 340 base pair dimer, estimated to be 0.8% of the entire genome. Eco R1 and Hha I yielded fragments with similar electrophoretic mobility to the Hae III dimer. In each case this band was markedly enriched in DNA reassociating at a 0t of less than or equal to 1. Hybridization of the Hae III dimer to gels eluted on to filters demonstrated that the multiple Hae III fragments and Eco R1 fragments contained compatible sequences. These sequences may comprise a distinct subclass of DNA.

The method is sensitive and does not require radioisotopes or ultracentrifugation. The estimation of plasmid mass from the extent of DNA migration in gels compares favorably with results obtained by electron microscopy of plasmid DNA purified by equilibrium density centrifugation. The method has proved to be a useful tool for survey work and the epidemiological investigation of plasmid dissemination, as well as an important adjunct to the genetic analysis of plasmids.

Electrophoresis of resulting fragments revealed distinctions between the two cytoplasmic types. These distinctions suggest that factors responsible or cytoplasmic male sterility are located in the mitochondrial DNA, and that the mitochondrial genome is not inherited paternally.

AB  - Thienylcarbenicillin is another semisynthetic penicillin with a wide range of antibacterial activity including most of gram-negative bacterias, even such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To investigate penetration activities into bone and another tissues, 120 specimens of serum and 120 specimens of tissue were obtained from 20 patients, after i.v. injection of a single doses of 150 mg thienylcarbenicillin per kg body weight. The evaluation of concentration showed that Thienylcarbenicillin was eliminated from serum in a half-life time of 77 minutes. The concentration varied in different tissues. Maximal levels were found in musculature and in spongy bone. Unexpected high concentrations were found in fascia and in cutis. The lowest concentration was found in subcutis and compact bone. The experimental doses of 150 mg/kg body weight was not enough to gain a sufficient therapeutical level in compact bone.
TI  - Analysis of cytomegalovirus genomes with restriction endonucleases Hin D III and  EcoR-1.
AB  - Cleavage of genomes of eleven human, one simian, and one simian-related cytomegalovirus (CMV) isolate by the restriction endonucleases HinD III and EcoR-1 generated reproducible DNA fragments. The size range of CMV DNA fragments as estimated by contour length measurements in comparison with simian virus 40 form II DNA and by coelectrophoresis with EcoR-1 fragments of herpes simplex virus DNA varied between 15 X 10(6) and 0.5 X 10(6) daltons. Comparison of the cleavage products of each isolate in 1% agarose slab gels showed extensive comigration of fragments among the human CMV isolates. In the HinD III digests, three fragment bands comigrated among all human CMV isolates, and six fragments comigrated among most, but not all, human CMV isolates. In the EcoR-1 digests, nine fragment bands comigrated among all human CMV isolates, and five bands comigrated among most, but not all human isolates. Each isolate had a distinctive electrophoretic profile with either HinD III or EcoR-1 digests. No two isolates had identical HinD III or EcoR-1 patterns although some isolates did share more general pattern similarities than others. No clear-cut subgrouping of isolates based on cleavage pattern characteristics could be discerned. Comparison of HinD III and EcoR-1 patterns showed that human isolates differ greatly from nonhuman CMV isolates. HinD III and EcoR-1 digests of each isolate contained both major and minor molar classes of DNA fragments that ranged from about 1 and multiples of 1 M down to about 0.25 M; however, the summed molecular weights for major molar fragments resulting from HinD III or EcoR-1 digests of several isolates closely approximated the molecular weight of 10(8) of the intact genome.

TI  - Cleavage patterns of Drosophila melanogaster satellite DNA by restriction enzymes.
AB  - The five satellite DNAs of Drosophila melanogaster have been isolated by the combined use of different equilibrium density gradients and hydrolyzed by seven different restriction enzymes; Hae III, Hind II + Hind III, Hinf, Hpa II, EcoR I and EcoR II. The 1.705 satellite is not hydrolyzed by any of the enzymes tested. Hae III is the only restriction enzyme that cuts the 1.672 and 1.686 satellites. The cleavage products from either of these reactions has a heterogeneous size distribution. Part of the 1.688 satellite is cut by Hae III and by Hinf into three discrete fragments with M.W. that are multiples of 2.3 X 10(5) daltons (approximately 350 base pairs). In addition, two minor bands are detected in the 1.688-Hinf products. The mole ratios of the trimer, dimer and monomer are: 1:6.30 : 63.6 for 1.688-Hae III and 1 : 22.0 : 403 for 1.688-Hinf. Circular mitochondrial DNA (rho = 1.680) is cut into discrete fragments by all of the enzymes tested and molecular weights of these fragments have been determined.
TI  - Terminal labeling and addition of homopolymer tracts to duplex DNA fragments by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase.
AB  - Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, which requires a single-stranded DNA primer under the usual assay conditions, can be made to accept double-stranded DNA as primer for the addition of either rNMP or dNMP, if Mg+2 ion is replaced by Co+2 ion. The priming efficiency in the presence of Co+2 ion with respect to initial rate tested with 2 single-stranded primer, is 5-6 fold higher than that observed with Mg+2 ion. In the presence of Co+2 ion, the primer specificity is altered so that all forms of duplex DNA molecules can be labeled at their unique 3'-ends regardless of whether such ends are staggered or even. Thus, using ribonucleotide incorporation, we have for the first time employed this reaction for sequence analysis of duplex DNA fragments generated by restriction endonuclease cleavages. Furthermore, by using Co+2 ion, it is possible to add a long homopolymer tract of deoxyribonucleotides to the 3'-terminus of double-stranded DNA. Therefore, without prior treatment with lambda exonuclease to expose the 3' terminus as single-stranded primer, this reaction now permits insertion of homopolymer tails at the 3'-ends of all types of DNA molecules for the purpose of in vitro construction of recombinant DNA.
TI  - Molecular nature of two beta-lactamase-specifying plasmids isolated from Haemophilus influenzae type b.
AB  - The molecular nature of two beta-lactamase-specifying plasmids isolated from two  separate ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae type b strains was examined. A 30 X 10(6)-dalton (30-Mdal) plasmid (RSF007) had a copy number of approximately 3 per chromosomal equivalent and a mole fraction guanine plus cytosine content of 0.39. By heteroduplex analysis the 30-Mdal plasmid was found to contain the entire ampicillin translocation DNA segment (TnA) found on R factors of enteric origin. A 3.0-Mdal plasmid (RSF0885) was found as a multicopy pool of approximately 28 copies per chromosomal equivalent, had a mole fraction guanine plus cytosine content of 0.40, and contained only about one-third of the transposable TnA sequence. RSF007 and RSF0885 appeared to be unrelated plasmids in that they share base sequence homology only within the confines of the TnA segment. The 3.0-Mdal Haemophilus plasmid was used to transform E. coli to ampicillin resistance but was found to be unstable in this host in the absence of antibiotic. The possibility that R-plasmids arose in Haemophilus by the translocation of TnA from a donor R-factor onto an indigenous H. influenzae plasmid is discussed.
TI  - Comparative study of the in vitro antibacterial activity of cefoxitin, cefuroxine, and cephaloridine.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial effects of cefoxitin, a semisynthetic cephamycin, cefuroxime, a new cephalosporin antibiotic, and cephaloridine were compared. With gram-positive bacteria, marked differences were found only in the effects against Streptococcus faecalis, where cephaloridine and cefuroxime were superior to cefoxitin. With gram-negative aerobic bacteria, cefoxitin, which is known to be more resistant to beta-lactamases from gram-negative bacteria than any cephalosporin, was found to be more effective than cefuroxime and cephaloridine against ampicillin-resistant strains of Escherichia coli and indole-positive strains of Proteus. Haemophilus influenzae was found to be more susceptible to cefuroxime than to cefoxitin and cephaloridine. When ampicillin-resistant strains of H. influenzae were tested, markedly higher minimal inhibitory concentration values were obtained with cephaloridine in comparison to those obtained with ampicillin-susceptible strains. These increases in the minimal inhibitory concentration values were not observed with cefoxitin and cefuroxime, probably due to the resistance of these two compounds to beta-lactamases. Strains of Bacteroides fragilis were found to be much more susceptible to cefoxitin than to cefuroxime, which in turn was superior to cephaloridine. The results obtained indicate that cefoxitin and cefuroxime both are superior in their antibacterial spectra to the cephalosporins that are now in clinical use.

AB  - The various oligomeric viral DNA species produced at 32 C by two related syblines of ts-a-transformed mouse 3T3 cells were characterized. Results from the analysis of the cleavage products observed after digestion with restriction endonucleases from Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Escherichia coli RI, and Haemophilus suis are consistent with the assumption that in both sublines, the major oligomeric component is a dimer from which a segment of different length is deleted. The major oligomeric (27S) component in subline 1 was estimated to be 1.77 times the size of the viral monomer, and the major (25.5S) component in subline 15 was estimated to be 1.54 times the size of the viral monomer. These size estimates were confirmed by electron micrograph measurements. The larger oligomers produced by both sublines were found to be multiples of the major oligomeric component of each subline.
TI  - [Gentamicin-susceptibility of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials].
AB  - We studied on the antibacterial activity of gentamicin against various pathogens  isolated from clinical materials mainly isolated during 1974 and 1975, comparing with other antibiotics. Beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci are less susceptible to gentamicin than staphylococci. Staph, aureus and Staph. epidermidis resistant to various antibiotics are very susceptible to gentamicin, and no resistant strain to this drug was found. Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and H. parahaemolyticus are very susceptible to gentamicin, and there is no resistant strain to this drug. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Serratia and five species of Proteus are more susceptible to gentamicin and tobramycin than dibekacin and amikacin. A few resistant or less susceptible strains to gentamicin are found in E. coli, Citrobacerr, Serratia, Pr. morganii and Pr. rettgeri. Pr. inconstans is less susceptible to gentamicin than other species of Proteus. Antibacterial activity of gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa is very strong, but dibekacin and tobramycin are stronger. Gentamicin-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are now rather few.
TI  - Synchronous digestion of SV40 DNA by exonuclease III.
AB  - We have established an optimal condition for the synchronous digestion of SV40 DNA with Escherichia coli exonuclease III. Electron microscopy and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were used to obtain accurate measurements on the lengths of DNA before and after exonuclease III digestion. Based on this finding, a new method for determining the sequence of long duplex DNA can be realized. It involves (a) the synchronous digestion of the DNA from the 3' ends with exonuclease III, followed by (b) repair synthesis with labeled nucleotides and DNA polymerase, and (c) sequence analysis of the repaired DNA.
TI  - Terminal labeling and addition of homopolymer tracts to duplex DNA fragments by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase.
AB  - Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, which requires a single-stranded DNA primer under the usual assay conditions, can be made to accept double-stranded DNA as primer for the addition of either rNMP or dNMP, if Mg+2 ion is replaced by Co+2 ion. The priming efficiency in the presence of (C leads to) CO+2 ion with respect to initial rate tested with 2 single-stranded primer, is 5-6 fols higher than that observed with Mg+2 ion. In the presence of Co+2 ion, the primer specificity is altered so that all forms of duplex DNA molecules can be labeled at their unique 3' -ends regardless of whether such ends are staggered or even. Thus, using ribonucleotide incorporation, we have for the first time employed this reaction for sequence analysis of duplex DNA fragments generated by restriction endonuclease cleavages. Furthermore, by using Co+2 ion, it is possible to add a long homopolymer tract of deoxyribonucleotides to the 3'-terminus of double-stranded DNA. Therefore, without prior treatment with lambda exonuclease to expose the 3' terminus as single-stranded primer, this reaction now permits insertion of homopolymer tails at the 3'-ends of all types of DNA molecules for the purpose of in vitro construction of recombinant DNA.
TI  - Histone gene arrangement in the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus.
AB  - The DNA coding for histones from Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, purified up to 100-fold with the use of Hg+2-CS2-SO4 and actinomycin-CsC1 equilibrium density gradients, has been used to study the clustering of genes coding for different histones and the size of the repeating multigene cluster. When digested with EcoRI restriction endonuclease, the histone DNA is identified in two classes of fragments with molecular weights of 1.15 X 106 and 2.8 X 106, whereas after treatment of the DNA with HindIII restriction endonuclease, histone gene sequences can be identified only in a fragment of 3.95 X 106. Treatment of the DNA with both enzymes simultaneously shows that there is a HindIII site within the smaller EcoRI fragment. Partial digests with HindIII give fragment sizes that appear to be simple multiples of a 3.95 X 106 repeat. Individual histone mRNAs all hybridize to the 3.95 X 106 fragment but only to one or the other EcoRI fragments. The evidence strongly suggests a repeating unit of 3.95 X 106 containing the genes for most, if not all, the histonrs.
TI  - Cefamandole: antimicrobial activity in vitro of a new cephalosporin.
AB  - Cefamandole, a new cephalosporin derivative, was found to have a broad spectrum of activity against a cross-section of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from clinical material. Gram-positive cocci, except for Streptococcus faecalis, were very susceptible. Penicillin G-resistant Staphylococcus aureus also was susceptible to cefamandole. Minimal bactericidal concentrations for gram-positive cocci approximated the minimal inhibitory concentrations. Strains of Haemophilus influenzae were very susceptible to the drug. Most strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., and Proteus sp. were inhibited by low concentrations. Increasing resistance occurred with larger inocula. Strains of Pseudomonas sp. were resistant to cefamandole.
TI  - Human papillomavirus DNA: physical map.
AB  - Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA form I (supercoiled) was prepared from plantar warts. HPV DNA was cleaved with restriction enzymes obtained from the following sources: escherichia coli (EcoRI), Hemophilus influenzae strain Rd (both unfractionated Hind and aeparated HindII and HindIII enzymes) and Hemophilus parainfluenzae (HpaI). The cleavage products were analyzed by polyacrylamide gradient slab gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy. HPV DNA was cleaved into two fragments by EcoRI (87% and 13% of the genome) and into six fragments, ranging in size from 33.5 to 1.2% of the genome, by Hind endonucleases. The six Hind fragments result from the cleavage of three sequences recognized by HindII, two of which are also cleaved by HpaI, and of three sequence recognized by HindIII. The order of these fragments was determined by comparing their size with that of the fragments obtained with HindII, HindIII, HpaI, and the mixture of HindIII + Hpal. The two EcoRI cleavage sites were located on two adjacent Hind fragments and one of these sites has been taken for the zero point to construct a physical map. The treatment of superhelical HPV DNA with bacteriophage T4 gene 32 protein yields circular structures with a denaturation loop. The cleavage of these complexes with EcoRI and HindIII has shown two easily denatured regions which were located on the cleavage map.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in infancy and childhood in Lusaka (One year prospective sturdy).
AB  - In approximately 10,000 admissions in a 12 months period, at University Teaching  Hospital, Lusaka 85 cases of meningitis were recorded. The signs and symptoms in these patients do not greatly differ from other similar studies in Africa. The commonest organism isolated was pneumococcus. There was high mortality rate which was to a large extent due to parents not bringing their children to hospital early enough for medical treatment to be instituted. This is borne out by the fact that 50% of the children with meningitis died within the first 24 hours. The C.S.F. protein and peripheral white blood count may be of prognostic value. Spasticity, cranial nerve palsises hydrocephalus and subdural effusion were the commonest complications.

TI  - Hybridization of labeled RNA to DNA in agarose gels.
AB  - Specific DNA restriction endonuclease fragments can be identified after electrophoresis in agarose gels by hybridization in the gel (in situ) to radioactive homologous RNA. RNA-DNA hybrids are detected by autoradiography of the gel. Comparison of band patterns of the autoradiogram and the ethidium bromide stained gel allows the identification of the DNA fragment which is complementary to the RNA probe. The technique is rapid, easy and inexpensive. It is sensitive enough to detect individual genes in a mixture of fragments produced by restriction enzyme digestion of complex cellular DNA. We have used this technique to determine which of the Hin III and Eco R1 fragments of phi80d3ilv+su+7 and E. coli DNAs contain the 5S, 16S and 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes of E. coli.

TI  - Mapping of cleavage sites for restriction endonucleases in lambdadv plasmids.
AB  - Restriction nucleases from Escherichia coli carrying the resistance transfer factor RI, from Hemophilus influenzae, Hemophilus parainfluenzae, and Bacillus subtilis were used for the generation of specific DNA fragments from lambdadv plasmids. Cleavage maps were established for various plasmids containing different but overlapping parts of bacteriophage lambdaDNA by analysis of digestion patterns obtained in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The correlation between the plasmid cleavage maps and the genetic map of lambda was based upon the location of the EcoRI cleavage site at 81.3% of lambda fractional length and the position of promoters PL and PR on the plasmid DNA fragments.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of BL-S640, a new oral cephalosporin antibiotic.
AB  - BL-S640, a new oral cephalosporin analogue, was evaluated in vitro against 102 gram-negative and 80 gram-positive bacteria. The antimicrobial spectrum was similar to that of previous cephalosporin analogues. Good antimicrobial activity against strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, staphylococci, and streptococci was demonstrated. Relatively poor activity and/or resistance was noted among most strains of Proteus, Providencia, Pseudomonas, and Serratia. In comparative studies BL-S640 had better activity against strains of Hemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterobacteriaceae than many cephalosporin analogues. Variation of susceptibility results was dependent upon the type of media and inoculum size. Cross-resistance between BL-S640 cephalexin, cephalothin, and cefazolin was demonstrated. Among strains of Klebsiella the more rapid selection of resistance ot other cephalosporins was in contrast to BL-S640. Experience in vitro with BL-S640 has documented its antimicrobial activity,and further studies of pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy are indicated.
TI  - Investigation of the repetitive sequences in calf DNA by cleavage with restriction nucleases.
AB  - Calf thymus DNA was digested with the restriction nucleases from Escherichia coli carrying resistance transfer factor I, Haemophilus influenzae Rd and Bacillus subtilis X5 (EcoRI, Hind II, and Bsu, respectively) and submitted to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. About 10% of the DNA migrated as discrete fragments in 8, 16, and 30 bands, respectively, superimposed upon a continuous distribution of various size DNA fragments. The fragments within the bands are repeated 2000 to 160000 times in the haploid genome. Their sizes range from about 10 to a few thousand nucleotide pairs. About 5% of the DNA in EcorRI and Hind II digests migrated in a band at the position of undigested DNA, probably due to the resistance of long stretches of DNA against these nucleases. Calf DNA fragments obtained with EcoRI and Hind II were isolated by preparative gel electrophoresis. DNA from the bands showed the behaviour of repetitive DNA in renaturation experiments. An EcoRI fragment 1300-nucleotide-pairs long, which represents 6% of the calf genome and occurs 130000 times, is tandemly repeated (derived from the satellite of 1.714 g/cm3, see below). Another EcoRI fragment of 970 nucleotide paris, which represents 0.5% of the calf genome and is derived from the DNA of 1.710 g/cm3 seems to be structurally related to the foregoing fragment since it shows a similar Hind II and Bsu cleavage pattern. It alternates with a 1550-nucleotide-pairs-long EcoRI fragment. In another series of experiments total calf DNA was separated into main-band and satellite fractions by density-gradient centrifugation and chromatography in the presence of a base-specific dye. Purified fractions were characterized by analytical ultracentrifugation and by Hind II and EcorRI digestions. From the cleavage patterns of purified fractions an assignment of the bands found with total calf DNA to satellite fractions was possible. Most fragments were derived from the components of density 1.709 and 1.710 g/cm3. The 1.714-g/cm3 satellite was cleaved into a 1300-nucleotide-pairs-ling EcorRI fragment and two Hind II fragments of 1100 and 180 nucleotide pairs. The satellites of 1.723 g/cm3 and 1.705 g/cm3 were not cleaved by either Hind II or EcoRI DNAase. On digestion of main band DNA with Bsu a 160-nucleotide-pairs-long fragment was obtained which was also observed, at a frequency of about 160000, in the Bsu digest of EcoRI fractions from total calf DNA.

TI  - R-factor mediated beta-lactamase production by Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Production of beta-lactamase by 15 strains of Haemophilus influenzae has been investigated. All the strains produce a constitutive beta-lactamase, which readily hydrolyses penicillin G, ampicillin, and cephaloridine. The beta-lactamase produced by these strains is indistinguishable from the type-IIIa enzyme commonly found in strains of Escherichia coli. The beta-lactamase gene has been transferred from the enzyme-producing strains of Haemophilus to strains of H. parainfluenzae and a strain of E. coli.
TI  - Laboratory studies with cefatrizine (SK + F 60771), a new broad-spectrum orally-active cephalosporin.
AB  - Cefatrizine (SK&F 60771), a new orally-active semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, was compared with cephalexin and cefazolin for in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetic behavior in laboratory animals. The average MIC values obtained with cefatrizine against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were superior to those obtained with cephalexin and somewhat poorer than those of cefazolin. In addition, a large percentage of the enterobacter and enterococcus isolates were found to be susceptible. Cefatrizine had a longer biological half-life and a higher peak serum level than either cefazolin or cephalexin when administered parenterally or orally to mice at 20 mg/kg. It had striking in vivo protective activity in mice infected with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Hemophilus influenzae, Proteus morganii or Staphylococcus aureus reflecting its superior pharmacokinetic profile in this animal species. A variable pharmacokinetic response between animal species was observed when cefatrizine was administered either orally or parenterally to dogs, squirrel monkeys or rabbits.
TI  - [Chemotherapy of purulent meningitis in children (author's transl)].
AB  - Purulent meningitis in patients admitted to the pediatric department of Kyoto University Hospital and affiliated institutions from 1951 through 1973 were studied with emphasis on the kinds of the causative organisms and the susceptibility of these organisms to antibiotics. The findings in this study have served to help select antibiotics most likely to be effective against this disease. The overall incidence of purulent meningitis was 0.68%. This figure decreased little throughout the period. As for the frequency of causative organisms, Neisseria meningitidis led the list, and Diplococcus pneumoniae ranked just behind. Haemophilus influenzae was rare. The frequency of N. meningitidis, however, decreased sharply in spite of the essentially unchanged overall incidence of this disease. The probable reason for the poor prognosis of this disease in spite of the remarkable strides in chemotherapy is the decreased frequency of N. meningitidis and the inversely increased organisms that are resistant to usual chemotherapy. The therapeutic effectiveness of cefazolin against this disease was studied in 15 children including eight newborns and four infants. The daily per kg bodyweight dose was 50 mg or less in four, 50 approximately 100 mg in five, and more than 100 mg in the remaining six. The route of administration was either intramuscular or intravenous. No deaths occurred. The rate of effectiveness was as high as 80%. Residual symptoms were recorded in six and, in as many as five of them, the cause was a-tributable to the delayed detection of the disease. Neither side effects nor aberrent laboratory findings attributable to large doses of cefazolin were recorded. Diffusibility of cefazolin into the CSF was studied in nine subjects. The CSF concentration of this antibiotic was shown to be somewhat lower than that of ampicillin or cephaloridine and to account on an average for 13% of the mean peak serum level. This relatively low diffusibility will be offset by its high serum concentration and safe large-dose therapy. These findings have clearly shown that the therapeutic effectiveness of cefazolin is as high as that of ampicillin, and that this excellent effectiveness holds true even when the causative organism happens to be Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, etc. that are resistant to ampicillin. The authors have furthermore scrutinized much literature on the frequency of the causative organisms, emergence of resistant strains, and the diffusibility of antibiotics into the CSF, and arrived at the conclusion that cefazolin is a promising antibiotic of choice for the treatment of purulent meningitis in newborn. The daily dose is preferably 150 mg/kg or more given in three divided intravenous doses. Meanwhile ampicillin proved to be useful as the antibiotic of choice for the treatment of purulent meningitis in infants and children.
TI  - Comparative inhibitory activity of BL-S640 and two other cephalosporins.
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activity of BL-S640 was compared to that of cephalothin and cephalexin against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria isolated from clinical specimens. BL-S640 demonstrated the best activity on nearly all microbial species studied, except for Haemophilus influenzae and Diplococcus pneumoniae against which cephalothin was slightly more active.
TI  - Evaluation of bacteriological transport systems.
AB  - Seven commercially manufactured bacteriological transport systems, including Culturette, Trans-Cul (with Stuart and Amies), Handiswab, Securline (with Amies and Amies without charcoal) and Culture Caddy, were evaluated to determine whether these systems were capable of maintaining the viability and constant numbers of mixtures of hardy, fastidious and anaerobic organisms over 72 hours at 25C and 4C. The results of the study indicated that if specimens are maintained in transport systems at 25C they should be cultured at four hours to minimize loss of viability and to assure accurate quantitation. No one transport system excelled over the other for maintenance of cultures at room temperature. Most organisms survived well in all of the transport systems for 72 hours when refrigerated.
TI  - Cross-reactive antigens and immunity to diseases caused by encapsulated bacteria.
AB  - Antigenic structures may be shared among naturally occurring polymers, including  proteins and polysaccharides. Proteins are polymers of amino acids. Cross-reactions between proteins are due to similarities in their overall shape rather than their individual amino acid components. Cross-reactions have been demonstrated among proteins with similar evolutionary development and structure, such as serum albumins or immunoglobulins. Polysaccharides are polymers of monosaccharides. In contrast to proteins, antigenic specificities may be conferred by mono-, di-, and trisaccharides. Since there are about 150 known naturally occurring monosaccharides, it is not unexpected that cross-reactions are demonstrable between polysaccharides from widely divergent sources.
TI  - Location of histones on simian virus 40 DNA.
AB  - The physical location of histone molecules in a simian virus 40 DNA-histone complex isolated from purified virions was examined using site-specific restriction endonucleases. The complex contains four host histone species but lacks histone F1. Histones prevent complete cleavage of SV40 DNA by two restriction enzymes, HindIII and EcoRI. From the pattern of DNA fragments resulting from cleavage of the histone-DNA complex by the HindIII endonuclease, which makes six breaks on purified SV 40 DNA, we have concluded that histones are randomly arranged on SV40 DNA relative to restriction enzyme cleavage sites. The EcoRI endonuclease, which makes one break in SV40 NDA, was used to determine the degree of physical coverage of the SV 40 DNA molecule by histones. We observed that 80% of the EcoRI sites in the complex are accessible to the enzyme while 20% are "closed." This degree of coverage is consistent with the mass ratio of DNA:histone in the complex as revealed by the buoyant density of the formaldehyde-fixed complex. We conclude that the histones in the complex are located randomly on the SV 40 genome and cover approximatley 20% of the DNA. These results suggest that the histone species F2b, F2al, F2a2, and F3 are bound without regard to nucleotide sequence of SV 40 DNA.

TI  - Analysis of the breaking sites in the physical degradation of DNA.
AB  - The 3'-termini of procaryotic and eucaryotic DNA fragments obtained by shearing,  sonication and irradiation have been analyzed. Analysis of the 3'-ends of DNA fragments was done by 32-P-labeling with terminal transferase, hydrolysis of products by spleen DNAase and spleen exonuclease and separation of labeled 3'-terminal nucleotides on polyethyleneimine plates. In the case of sonication the deviation from DNA base composition of 3'-terminal nucleotides is very close to random for Escherichia coli and Haemophilius influenzae DNA, whereas for calf thymus, mouse and yeast mitochondrial DNAs a significant increase in dA and decrease in dC was observed. Shearing at high salt released random 3'-termini in E. coli DNA and 3'-termini with 4 to 6% deviation from base composition in calf thymus DNA. In the case of gamma-irradiation no real differences have been found between E. coli and calf thymus DNA and 3'-terminal nucleotide composition is very close to random. Mechanical breakage of eucaryotic DNA seems to release 3'-termini having a composition which differs slightly but significantly from the average base composition of the DNA.

TI  - Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in chronic bronchitis.
AB  - Authenic tracheobronchial secretions/exudates (TBSE) were aspirated under direct  vision via a sterile catheter passed through a fiberoptic bronchoscope from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease complicated by chronic bronchitis. TBSE, saliva and blood were obtained during long-term administration of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and were assayed for drug content. Before and during treatment TBSE were cultured qualitatively and quantitatively for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, fungi, mycoplasmas and viruses. Treatment with TMP-SMX was associated with a decrease in the recovery of Hemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis; however, little effect was observed on the typically nonpathogenic aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of the upper respiratory tract. TMP was found in saliva at concentrations greater than in serum. Both TMP and SMX entered TBSE in absolute and relative concentrations sufficient to take advantage of the potential for synergy against susceptible microorganisms. Patient tolerance of TMP-SMX was generally good and several patients reported a decrease in production of sputum during treatment.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in children.
AB  - The present report extends experience with the use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) in children aged 3 months to 10 years. The regimen was TMP (200 mg)--SMX (1000 mg)/m-2d given in two equal doses. The drug was easily administered, well tolerated and efficacious in the treatment of a variety of infections in 12 children. A steady state had been achieved by the third dose of medication and accumulation of either component during days 1 through 4 did not occur. Serum concentrations of TMP were slightly lower in children aged less than 3 years compared with those aged 3 to 6 years but the differences were small and these results are preliminary. Peak mean serum TMP concentration was highest at day 3 when it reached 1.63 mug/ml. It is concluded that this regimen may be suboptimal for some major parenchymal infections even though the therapeutic result was excellent in most children.
TI  - [Bacteriological studies on fosfomycin. Antibacterial activity in vitro and in vivo (author's transl)].
AB  - We have examined the antibacterial activity of the new antibiotic, fosfomycin (FOM) in vitro and in vivo. The following results were obtained. 1. FOM showed a broad antibacterial spectrum. 2. The antibacterial activity of FOM was enhanced in the medium at pH 6 and pH 7, and was also influenced by the addition of rabbit serum, calf serum, glucose-6-phosphate or defibrilated sheep blood to the growth medium, and by the size of inoculum. 3 FOM showed especially strong bactericidal action upon the bacteria at the logarithmic phase. 4. FOM showed remarkable therapeutic effect against most strains of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria tested in experimental infections of mice. 5. The therapeutic effect of FOM was especially remarkable for infection with Salmonella. 6. The therapeutic effect of FOM was more potent than the other drugs tested against infection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 7. It seems that FOM is more active in vivo than in vitro with respect to antibacterial activity.
TI  - A new parenteral cephalosporin. SK&F 59962: in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity and serum levels in experimental animals.
AB  - SK&F 59962, a new parenteral cephalosporin was found to have a high order of in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity against a broad-spectrum of clinical isolates. When tested in vitro against gram-negative organisms, SK&F 59962 was consistently more active than cefazolin and far superior to cephalothin. This new antibiotic had activity equal to that of cephalothin against gram-positive bacteria. Enterobacter species were found to be susceptible to SK&F 59962. In mouse infection studies using bacterial pathogens, SK&F 59962 had protective activity of the order of that of cefazolin and superior to that of cephalothin. Following parenteral administration the serum profile of SK&F 59962 in the mouse, dog and squirrel monkey was similar to that of cephalothin. SK&F 59962 and cephalothin had lower peak serum concentrations and shorter biologic half-lives than those of cefazolin.

TI  - Induction of serum Haemophilus influenzae type B capsular antibodies in adult volunteers fed cross-reacting Escherichia coli 075:K100:H5.
AB  - Serum Haemophilus influenzae Type b (HITB) anticapsular antibodies were induced in adult volunteers by feeding of either of two strains of a cross-reacting Escherichia coli 075:K100:H5. In all the fed volunteers colonization for a finite period lasting up to eight weeks occurred, without adventitious reactions. Nine of 14 normal volunteers and one of two volunteers previously immunized with the Type 6 H.influenzae polysaccharide responded with a greater than twofold increase in serum Type 6H. influenzae antibodies. These antibodies induced by Esch. coli were specific for the capsular polysaccharide and had bactericidal activity. The safety of this procedure, the comparable results in laboratory animals and the identification of other cross-reacting strains of Esch. coli with meningococcal and pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides suggest that colonization with these nonpathogenic organisms at birth may provide a general method of preventive immunization to diseases caused by encapsulated bacteria.
TI  - Heteroimmunization to the capsular polysaccharide of Haemophilus influenzae type  b induced by enteric cross-reacting bacteria.
AB  - Cross-reacting Escherichia coli strains Easter and 89 and Bacillus pumilis fed to newborn rabbits and E. coli fed to adult rhesus monkeys did not exert untoward reactions. The E. coli regularly colonized the newborns' intestinal tract from 1 to 7 weeks. High doses of E. coli were necessary to colonize adult primates. Colonization occurred in fewer newborn rabbits and lasted only 1 to 3 weeks with B. pumilis. Colonized newborn rabbits and adult rhesus had an active Haemophilus influenzae type b (HITB) immune response. In the rabbit, colonization resulted in accelerated induction of immunoglobulin (Ig) M-. IgA-, and IgG-producing cells in the spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, and Peyer's patches after HITB challenge. E. coli-fed and control newborn primates were naturally colonized with nasopharyngeal and enteric cross-reacting bacteria and both groups rapidly developed HITB antibodies in the absence of the homologous organisms. Human newborn stool cultures, taken at the time of discharge from the nursery, showed a 0.9% carriage rate for cross-reacting E. coli. These "carrier" infants acquired HITB antibodies more rapidly than their age-matched "noncarrier" controls.
TI  - Simian virus 40 DNA directs synthesis of authentic viral polypeptides in a linked transcription-translation cell-free system.
AB  - A linked cell-free system has been developed which is capable of transcribing and translating mamalian viral DNA, and its characteristics and requirements are outlined. In this system, simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA Form I (supercoiled) directed the synthesis of discrete polypeptides up to 85,000 daltons in size. One of these products was indistingusihable from authentic major virus capsid protein VPI, as judged by mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gels, antibody predipitation, and peptide analyses. The cell-free products larger than VPI comprised a number of polypeptides ranging in molecular weight from 50,000 to 85,000. These polypeptides demonstrated no immunological relationship whatsoever to the structural protein VPI. However, two of these products, along with one of approximately 25,000 dlatons, were precipitated with antiserum to SV40 tumor antigen. Linear SV40 DNA generated by the cleavage of Form I DNA with the restriction endonuclease EcoR1 was an efficient template in this system and also directed the synthesis of a polypeptide migrating with VPI on polyacrylamide gels. The potential of this system for defining a functional map of a DNA genome is discussed.
TI  - Anatomy of herpes simplex virus DNA: strain differences and heterogeneity in the  locations of restriction endonuclease cleavage sites.
AB  - Digestion of herpes simplex virus DNA by the HinIII or Eco RI restriction endonucleases yielded 11 to 15 fragments with molecular weights between 1 x 10(6) and 28 x10(6). The electrophoretic profiles obtained in 0.3% agarose gels with DNA fragments from none different strains of herpes simplex virus type 1 could be readily differentiated from the patterns exhibited by the corresponding fragments from four separate strains of type 2 virus; however, with each serotype, the laboratory strains differed significantly among themselves and also from isolates passaged a minimum number of times outside the human host. Digestion of all DNAs of herpes simples virus with either enzyme reproducibly generated two classes of fragments (major and minor) which differed in molar ocncentration. Moreover, although the molecular weight of an intact herpes simplex 1(F1) DNA molecule is approximately 98 x 10(6), the summed molecular weights of all major and minor HinIII fragments totalled 160 x 10(6), and the seven major fragments alone accounted for only 60 x 10(6). These unusual features indicate the existence of limited heterogeneity in the positions of cleavage sitet along individual molecules. We have eliminated the possibility that minor fragments arose from contamination with the defective DNA of high byoyant density which appears on serial undiluted passage of the virus. In fact, this latter type of DNA was resistant to cleavage by HinIII and gave large amounts of only two species of EcoRI fragments; suggesting that the defective molecules consist of many tandem repeats of a small segment of viral DNA. The heterogeneity in the viral DNA of normal density appears to be related to the structural organization of the molecules and does not necessarily imply differences in genetic content.
TI  - A transferable kanamycin resistance plasmid isolated from Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Kanamycin resistance was transferred by conjugation from a Haemophilus influenzae strain into Escherichia coli K12, and between E. coli K12 strains in subsequent transfers. Covalently closed molecules of DNA were isolated by sedimentation analysis of the DNA of the resistant E. coli K12 strains. These facts support the hypothesis that kanamycin resistance is mediated by a transferable plasmid in this strain of H. influenzae.

Serological evidence of infection with H. influenzae was found in 38 of 57 patients with acute exacerbations, and Str. pneumoniae infection in 10 of the 57 patients, but was generally absent from healthy control subjects and from patiens producing mucoid sputum. No serological evidence of infection with other organisms named above was found to be associated with exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. Ten patients with acute exacerbations were without serological evidence of infection by any of the bacteria tested.

TI  - Ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae type B possessing a TEM-type beta-lactamase but little permeability barrier to ampicillin.
AB  - Ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae type B have been reported only during the past year. Five clinical isolates from the U.S. and Germany all had the TEM-type beta-lactamase which is known to be transferred widely among other gram-negative bacilli. Unlike those bacilli, however, the H. influenzae cell had very little barrier to entry of penicillins. This greater permeability of the H. influenzae cell to penicillins appeared to reduce the protective effect of its beta-lactamase, in that acquisition of the TEM-type beta-lactamase increased levels of resistance to penicillins much less for individual cells of H. influenzae than for those of Escherichia coli. Large inocula of either species appeared highly resistant. The unusually low level of resistance of individual cells of H. influenzae containing the TEM-type beta-lactamase may have delayed their emergence or recognition, and has unresolved clinical implications.

TI  - Identification and characterization of the in vitro synthesized gene products of  bacteriophage M13.
AB  - Bacteriophage M13 replicative form (RF) DNA was used to direct coupled transcription and translation in cell-free extracts prepared from Escherichia coli. By using RF DNA, isolated from cells infected with appropriate amber mutants of this phage, it has been possible to identify the products of genes I through IV. By using the same methods no gene-product relationship could be demonstrated for genes VI and VII. Coupled in vitro protein synthesis studies on RF-III DNA, a linear double-stranded DNA molecule, obtained after cleavage of either RF-I or RF-II DNA with the restriction endonuclease R.Hin11 from Haemophilus influenzae, indicated that the cleavage site for this enzyme is located in gene II. The in vitro products of both gene III and gene VIII are about 30 and six amino acids longer, respectively, than their native counterparts present within the virion. These results suggest that the latter proteins arise in vivo by cleavage of precursor molecules. Coupled transcription and translation studies on a DNA fragment which only contained the genetic information coding for gene IV protein, obtained after cleavage of RF DNA with the restriction endonuclease R.Hap11 from Haemophilus aphirophilus, indicated that a large number of the in vitro synthesized polypeptides are the result of premature chain termination.

The method permits determination of the reaction rate constants for the formation, dark dissociation, and repair photolysis of enzyme-substrate complexes under various conditions, and estimation of the number of photoreactivating enzyme molecules present. Investigation of these characteristics is basic for understanding of the overall photoreactivation kinetics observed in biological systems, its dependence on experimental parameters, and possibly its biological significance.
TI  - Repair by genetic recombination in bacteria: overview.
AB  - DNA molecules that have been damaged in both strands at the same level are not subject to repair by excision but instead can be repaired through recombination with homologous molecules. Examples of two-strand damage include postreplication gaps opposite pyrimidine dimers, two-strand breaks produced by X-rays, and chemically induced interstrand cross-links. In ultraviolet-irradiated bacteria, the newly synthesized DNA is of length equal to the interdimer spacing. With continued incubation, this low-molecular-weight DNA is joined into high-molecular-weight chains (postreplication repair), a process associated with sister exchanges in bacteria. Recombination is initiated by pyrimidine dimers opposite postreplication gaps and by interstrand cross-links that have been cut by excision enzymes. The free ends at the resulting gaps presumably initiate the exchanges. Postreplication repair in Escherichia coli occurs in recB- AND RECC but is greatly slowed in recF- mutants. RecB and recC are the structural genes for exonuclease V, which digests two-stranded DNA by releasing oligonucleotides first from one strand and then from the other. The postreplication sister exchanges in ultra-violet-irradiated bacteria result in the distribution of pyrimidine dimers between parental and daughter strands, indicating that long exchanges involving both strands of each duplex occur. The R1 restriction endonuclease from E. COli has been used to cut the DNA of a bacterial drug-resistance transfer factor with one nuclease-sensitive site, and also DNA from the frog Xenopus enriched for ribosomal 18S and 28S genes. The fragments were annealed with the cut plasmid DNA and ligated, producing a new larger plasmid carrying the eukaryotic rDNA and able to infect and replicate in E. coli.
TI  - Comparative in vitro acitvity of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol on common aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli(Salmonella and Shigella excluded).
AB  - The antibacterial activity of thiamphenicol was compared to that of chloramphenicol against 313 strains of gram-negative bacilli isolated from various clinical specimens. These two antiboitics were equally active against the 106 isolates of Haemophilus MIC equals 0.1 minus 1.56 mu g/ml) and against 40 strains of Bacteroides fragilis (almost all strains being inhibited by 12.5 mug/ml of the two drugs). In contrast, when compared with chloramphenicol, 2-16 times as much of thiamphenicol was required to inhibit Enterobacteriacae, making prediction of the susceptibility of these strains to thiamphenicol on the basis of chloramphenicol testing alone likely to be hazardous. Disc diffusion test using 30-mug discs and 12 mm as cut-off point was a reliable technique to determine susceptibility of bacteria either to chloramphenicol or thiamphenicol. When thiamphenicol discs of greater potency (50 mug) were employed, many strains exhibited wide zones of inhibition although most of them were resistant by the agar dilution method (MIC is greater than 12.5 mug/ml). This practice is not advisable for testing organisms isolated outside of the urinary tract.

TI  - Doxycycline in respiratory tract infections. A review of a multi-centre trial.
AB  - A total of 256 patients were admitted in Germany into a Pan-European multi centre trial of doxycycline in the treatment of infections of the respiratory tract. The diagnoses showed a preponderance of lower respiratory tract infections compared with other European countries, due largely to the fact that the participating physicians were pulmonary or internal medicine specialists. Doxycycline was given in a dose of 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg daily for 5-10 days (only the occasional patient varied from this regimen). Side-effects were uncommon (2.5-3.5%) and affected only the gastrointestinal tract. Four patients had to change antibiotic therapy, not because of side-effects but because of possible bacterial resistance in these patients. The results were comparable with those from the rest of Europe: 88% of patients had a good or very good response. Nine patients were treated for longer than 14 days and only eight patients did not show improvement.

AB  - One thousand specimens of bronchial secretion from children with non-specific respiratory diseases have been examined bacteriologically. In spite of the complex nature of acute and especially of chronic respiratory disease the role of bacterial infection should not be underestimated. Thirty per cent of the specimens were sterile. More than 20 per cent of the bacterial species isolated from bronchial secretion were pathogenic. Relatively frequent was the isolation of E. coli and of pathogenic staphylococci. Nearly 40 per cent of all isolated bacteria were alpha-haemolytic streptococci. The latter have been found more frequently in children with, than in children without bronchological alterations. The pathogenicity of alpha-haemolytic streptococci in the bronchial tree is discussed.

The linear DNA from these phages can be circularized by annealing with fragments of phiX RF DNA produced by the Haemophilus influenzae restriction nuclease. The circularization experiment indicated that the site of breakage of the linear phage DNAs is not unique nor confined to a particular region of the genome. These linear DNAs were less than 0.1% as infective as circular phage DNA. The linear, positive strand of late RF II DNA, however, is uniquely nicked in the region of the phiX genome corresponding to cistron A. Although a low level of infectivity is associated with the linear DNA derived from late RF II, this infectivity appears to be a result of the association of linear positive and linear negative strands during the infectivity assay.

AB  - phiX-174 replicative form (RF) DNA was cleaved by restriction enzymes from Haemophilus aphirophilus (Hap) and H. influenzae (H-I strain Osaka) (HinH). Five fragments were produced by Hap and eight by HinH. The positions of all of the Hap fragments and six of the HinH fragments were mapped on the genome by heteroduplex transfection and DNA-DNA hybridization methods. In addition, fragment sizes of phiX-174 RF DNA and S13 RF DNA by Hap and HinH were compared. Considerable differences of the size of the fragments produced from these closely related phage genomes were observed.

AB  - Bacteriophage phiX174 DNA was labeled in vivo with [methyl-(3)H]methionine. The methyl-labeled progeny DNA was extracted from purified bacteriophage phiX174 particles and was used as template for in vitro synthesis of the complementary strand in the presence of the nucleoside triphosphates and Escherichia coli polymerase I. The resultant replicative form DNA was then cleaved, in separate experiments, with restriction endonucleases from Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius. The DNA fragments were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It is concluded that the single methylcytosine in the viral DNA is located in a specific region of the phiX174 genome, very likely in gene H.
TI  - The bacteriological status of a specific-pathogen-free animal production building and of its staff and the microbiological integrity of the animals one year after the building was commissioned.
AB  - Bacteriological contamination of a specific-pathogen-free (SPF) animal production building was more extensive after one year of operation than at the time of commissioning. Throat and nose swabs taken from the staff yielded a number of undesirable organisms, in particular, on one occasion, a Group A streptococcus. It is recommended that a closer bacteriological scrutiny of the staff of SPF production buildings ought perhaps to be made in the light of these findings.

Normal NBT values were observed during all 11 episodes of acute rejection. A significant elevation of the NBT score was encountered in six of eight episodes of infection after transplantation. A positive NBT result is useful additional evidence in favour of infection in patients in whom the differentiation of infection and rejection is proving difficult.
TI  - Fate of donor deoxyribonucleic acid in a highly transformation-deficient strain of Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - A transformation-deficient strain of Haemophilus influenzae (efficiency of transformation 10(4)-fold less than that of the wild type), designated TD24, was isolated by selection for sensitivity to mitomycin C. In its properties the mutant was equivalent to recA type mutants of Escherichia coli. The TD24 mutation was linked with the str-r marker (about 30%) and only weakly linked with the nov-r2.5 marker. The uptake of donor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was normal in the TD24 strain, but no molecules with recombinant-type activity (molecules carrying both the donor and the resident marker) were formed. In the mutant the intracellular presynaptic fate of the donor DNA was the same as that in the transformation-proficient (wild-type) strain, and the radioactive label of the donor DNA associated covalently with the recipient chromosome in about the same quantity as in the wild type. However, many fewer donor atoms were associated with segments of the mutant's recipient chromosome as compared with segments of the wild-type chromosome. In the mutant the association was accompanied by complete loss of donor marker activity. The lack of donor marker activity of the donor-recipient complex of DNA isolated from the mutant was not due to lack of uptake of the complex by the second recipient and its inability to associate with the second recipient's chromosome. Because the number of donor-atom-carrying resident molecules was higher than could be accounted for by the lengths of presynaptic donor molecules, we favor the idea that the association of donor DNA atoms with the mutant chromosome results from local DNA synthesis rather than from dispersive integration of donor DNA by recombination.

We suggest that the absence of such E. coli antibodies usually indicates a clinically significant defect in antibody production. This simple screening test is of use in the diagnosis of primary and secondary immunodeficiency disorders.

TI  - Secondary respiratory infection in hospital patients: effect of antimicrobial agents and environment.
AB  - A prospective study of 358 medical and 234 postoperative patients with clinical evidence of secondary chest infection showed that previous administration of antimicrobial agents greatly reduced the chance of obtaining a clear-cut laboratory report. In patients with radiographical evidence of pneumonia this led to a fourfold decrease in the overall rate of isolation of potential pathogens. Furthermore, 81 diverse "coliforms" were isolated from 258 medical and surgical patients who had received previous antimicrobial therapy while only four coliforms (all Escherichia coli) were isolated from 334 untreated patients. Thus the general hospital environment on its own seemed to have a negligible influence in promoting the growth of coliform flora in sputum. Any unique effect of underlying disease in this regard was masked by that of previous therapy. Finally, the results raised the possibility that previous antimicrobial therapy might have increased the risk of secondary pneumonia in hospital patients.

Similarly, DNA from Xenopus laevis was not taken up by competent H. influenzae. Of the heterologous DNAs tested, only DNA from H. parainfluenzae interfered with the uptake of H. influenzae DNA, as judged by competition experiments employing either DNA binding or genetic transformation as the test system. The extracellular heterologous DNA did not suffer either single- or double-strand breakage upon exposure to competent H. influenzae.

TI  - Polyoma DNA: a physical map.
AB  - The action of restriction enzymes on polyoma DNA was studied with uniformly (32)P-labeled viral DNA obtained from either infected 3T6 or secondary mouse-embryo cells. Three restriction enzymes were used to construct a physical map of the polyoma genome. An enzyme from Hemophilus parainfluenzae, Hpa(II), cleaved polyma DNA into eight unique fragments (Hpa(II)-1 to Hpa(II)-8), ranging in size from 27.3 to 1.8% of the genome. An enzyme from Hemophilus influenzae, Hin(III), gave two fragments (56 and 44%); and a third enzyme from Escherichia coli, EcoR(I), cut at a single unique site. The physical map of the polyma genome was constructed from methods involving: (1) further digestion of the fragments produced by enzymes EcoR(I) and Hin(III) with Hpa(II), and (2) analysis of the products of partial digestion with Hpa(II). Analysis by electron microscopy of replicating DNA molecules (less than 50% replicated) cut with the Hin(III) enzyme, in combination with other studies, has indicated that the origin of DNA replication is located at 71 +/- 3 map units from the EcoR(I) cleavage site, probably in Hpa(II)-5.
TI  - The nucleotide sequence preceding an RNA polymerase initiation site on SV40 DNA.  Part 2. The sequence of the early strand transcript.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the RNA transcript from the "early" (E) strand of SV40 DNA immediately preceding the preferred E. coli RNA polymerase start site is G-(A-A-A-C, -A-U-)-A-A-A-A-U-G-A-A-U-G-C-A-A-U-U-G-U-U-G-U-U-G-U-U-A-A-C-U-U-G-U-U-U-A-U-U-G- C-A-G-C-U-U-A-U-A-A-U-G-G-U-U-A-C-Ap. The last nucleotide of the sequence is the first nucleotide transcribed by E. coli RNA polymerase from the "E" strand. The DNA template contains a palindrome of 17 residues that includes the Hemophilus influenza restriction endonuclease cleavage site G-T-T-A-A-Cp. The DNA which gives this transcript lies very close to one end of SV40 DNA segment in the Adeno-SV40 hybrid virus Ad2+ND3 and appears to contain sufficient untranscribed information to specify the E. coli RNA polymerase start.
TI  - The nucleotide sequence preceding an RNA polymerase initiation site on SV40 DNA.  Part 1. The sequence of the late strand transcript.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the transcript of the "late" strand of the region of SV40 DNA preceding the preferred initiation site for Escherichia coli RNA polymerase has been determined to be U-G-U-A-A-C-C-A-U-U-A-U-A-A-G-C-U-G-C-A-A-U-A-A-A-C-A-A-G-U-U-A-A-C-A-A-C-A-A-C-A -A-U-U-G-Cp. Hemophilus influenza restriction endonuclease cleaves this region 30 nucleotides (base pairs) before the site of initiation of RNA synthesis by RNA polymerase.

AB  - JC virus was found to have a buoyant density of 1.20 g/cm(3) in linear sucrose-D(2)O and 1.35 g/cm(3) in cesium chloride isopycnic gradients. DNA extracted either from JC-infected cultures or from gradient-purified virions occupied a dense position relative to linear DNA in cesium chloride/ethidium bromide gradients, and the circular configuration of the extracted DNA was confirmed by electron microscopy, with a measured molecular weight of 2.93 x 10(6). DNA from BK virus was similarly prepared and compared to JC and to an SV40 DNA standard by digestion with restriction endonuclease preparations from Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and Escherichia coli. Digests were electrophoretically analyzed on gradient polyacrylamide slab gels or agarose gels, and the three viruses were found to have distinctly different cleavage patterns by this form of analysis: JC and BK viruses were almost entirely different from SV40 and significantly different from each other. Thus, JC and BK human papovaviruses appear to be discrete new members of the papovavirus group, rather than SV40 variants.

TI  - Mechanism of replication of single-stranded PhiX174 DNA. VII. Circularization of  the progeny viral strand.
AB  - Linear phiX174 single-stranded DNA can be isolated from phiX phage particles produced under various conditions. About half of the linear strands have a dGMP residue at the 5' end, the remaining have roughly comparable amounts of dCMP, dTMP, and dAMP. The linear strands can be converted to covalently closed circular molecules by polynucleotide ligase, but only after they have been incubated with T4 DNA polymerase and deoxynucleoside triphosphates. Experiments with endonuclease R, the restriction enzyme from Haemophilus influenzae, indicated that the nucleotides incorporated into the DNA during this reaction were found predominantly in a limited region of the genome. The results suggest that the normal intermediate in single-stranded phiX174 DNA synthesis may be a single-stranded linear molecule which is shorter than unit length and is intrinsically capable of circularization.

This facilitates the rapid processing of large numbers of swabs and allows the isolation of pathogens from sites where they might otherwise go unnoticed.

Both feedings were harmless and resulted in fecal excretion of the fed E. coli in most animals as well as active immunization of fed animals toward H. influenzae type b. Feeding non-enteropathogenic, cross-reacting E coli to newborns may be a method for inducing active immunity toward H. influenzae type b diseases by accelerating the acquisition of "natural" immunity.

Enterobacterial antigens cross-reactive with the capsular polysaccharides of these four bacteria were found. Bacteria cross-reactive with noncapsular antigens of meningococci and pneumococci were also observed. Since some enteric bacteria possess antigens with serological specificities similar to those of meningococci, the possibility that enteric bacteria cross-reactive with meningococcal antigens provide an antigenic stimulus for the observed age-related "natural" immunity to this pathogen is discussed.

Sera from rabbits that had been immunized with sonically treated material of 12 different bacteria, including M. bovis strain BCG, had antibodies that bound not only radiolabeled homologous test antigens but also radiolabeled antigens from many unrelated bacteria. Binding by normal and immunized sera to radiolabeled test antigens was inhibited by homologous unlabeled test antigens but not by substances such as bovine serum albumin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sheep erythrocytes, and endotoxin. The broad range of shared or cross-reactivity among antigens in bacteria may explain the presence of antibodies to many bacteria in sera from normal humans and previously unimmunized experimental animals. The presence of these antibodies raises the question whether resistance to many bacterial infections may be partly due to immune mechanisms, whether cellular or humoral, that have been stimulated by unrelated bacteria.

AB  - Amoxycillin (alpha-amino-p-hydroxybenzylpenicillin) is a new semi-synthetic penicillin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity similar to that of ampicillin. Penicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococci, streptococci, and pneumococci were sensitive to concentrations of 0.1 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. Strains of Haemophilus influenzae were inhibited by a level of 0.5 mug/ml, and most strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella sonnei, Salmonella species, and Streptococcus faecalis were sensitive to a concentration of 5 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. Penicillinase-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus and strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indole-positive Proteus, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter were insensitive to amoxycillin. The new penicillin was bactericidal in activity, as with other penicillins, and its antibacterial activity was not reduced in the presence of serum. After oral administration to volunteer subjects amoxycillin produced serum concentrations twice as high as those obtained with similar doses of ampicillin, and the penicillin was recovered unchanged in high concentrations in the urine. The absorption of amoxycillin was not greatly influenced by food, and administration of probenecid resulted in increased and more prolonged concentrations of amoxycillin in serum.

Using the genetic assay for small fragments of phiX DNA, we have shown that we can salvage markers from the endonuclease R phiX-RF fragments.

AB  - Respiratory disease in a dynamic colony of nonhuman primates during a 4-year period was due primarily to infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Diplococcus pneumoniae, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Pasteurella multocida, and Haemophilus influenzae. The principal secondary invaders were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and streptococci. A high fatality rate was associated with infections caused by each of the primary pathogens, and females appeared to be more susceptible than males. Incidence of respiratory disease was greatest in the fall and early winter; however, at all times newly colonized monkeys had a higher infection rate than conditioned monkeys. Infections were occasionally confined only to the lungs and were sometimes present without grossly observable lung lesions. The information given on susceptibility of 10 species of nonhuman primates to respiratory infections provides a basis for developing disease models.

AB  - The influence of ribo- and deoxyribonucleosides and ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides on the uptake of radiolabeled thymidine and thymine by Haemophilus influenzae during growth was investigated. A nucleoside-degrading enzyme similar to that reported in Escherichia coli was found to break down thymidine unless other nucleosides were present to divert its action. The presence of other nucleosides permitted a nearly quantitative uptake of even low levels of thymidine. This quantitative uptake of thymidine in the presence of an excess of other nucleosides suggests that the uptake mechanism for thymidine is specific in this organism. Under optimal conditions, as much as 50% of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) thymine was derived from exogenous thymidine. Thymine was not taken up by H. influenzae but, in the presence of purine deoxynucleosides, labeled thymine entered the cells, presumably as thymidine. Ribonucleosides or ribonucleotides inhibited thymine conversion to thymidine, but, as noted above, they were degraded by a cellular enzyme. Thus, unless the ribonucleoside level was excessively high, a cell level of growth was reached at which the inhibiting ribonucleoside was broken down and labeled thymine appeared in the cells at an increasing rate. Twenty-five per cent of the DNA thymine of this organism was labeled with exogenous thymine. The information noted above serves as the basis for isotopically labeling the DNA.

TI  - Genetic integration in the heterospecific transformation of Haemophilus influenzae cells by Haemophilus parainfluenzae deoxyribonucleic acid.
AB  - The in vivo chemical linkage of Haemophilus parainfluenzae deoxyribonucleic acid  (DNA) with the H. influenzae genome has been found to occur at a much higher level than is suggested by the low efficiency of the heterospecific transformation of an antibiotic resistance marker. This linkage, about 60% of the level with homospecific DNA, was found to involve alkali-stable bonding. The amount of host DNA label released (about 60%) was about the same as that released during homospecific transformation. Also, over 60% of the H. influenzae cells adsorbing H. parainfluenzae DNA could not form colonies upon plating. This lethality of the heterospecific transformation was not immediate but followed considerable metabolic activity of the host cells. These data are presented to show that the "limited-pairing" hypothesis may be only a partial explanation for the low efficiency of heterospecific transformation. Another hypothesis is presented which takes into account the lethal effect of this kind of transformation.
TI  - Cephalexin and cephaloglycin activity in vitro and absorption and urinary excretion of single oral doses in normal young adults.
AB  - A large number of recently isolated bacterial pathogens were tested for susceptibility to cephalexin and cephaloglycin by the replica inoculating method. Strains of group A hemolytic streptococci, viridans (alpha and gamma) streptococci, pneumococci, gonococci, meningococci, and penicillin G-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus were all moderately to highly susceptible to both of these cephalosporin analogues, nearly all of the strains being two to eight (median four) times more susceptible to cephaloglycin than to cephalexin. The penicillin G-resistant, penicillinase-producing strains of S. aureus varied in their susceptibility; many were moderately resistant to both analogues, particularly to cephalexin. Strains of enterococci, Haemophilus influenzae, and most of the common gram-negative bacilli were moderately to highly resistant. Reducing the size of the inoculum had variable effects on inhibition by these drugs, depending on the species or strain. The activity of cephalexin was very little affected by pH of the medium within the clinical range or by incubation at 37 C in broth for up to 24 hr. In contrast, cephaloglycin in broth deteriorated rapidly at 37 C, and its activity was markedly reduced in alkaline medium. Both cephalexin and cephaloglycin were rapidly absorbed and excreted into the urine after single oral doses of 500 mg. Much higher levels were achieved and sustained with the former. Absorption of both analogues was delayed when taken with food, and the levels in the serum were significantly higher and better sustained when probenecid was also given. Very high concentrations of cephalexin were excreted into the urine during the first 4 hr, and the levels were still high in the 4- to 8-hr collection. The concentrations of cephaloglycin in the urine at these times were much lower. An average of 80 to 93% of the dose of cephalexin and 25 to 30% of the cephaloglycin were accounted for as active drug in the urine collected in 8 hr. Both analogues were well tolerated.

AB  - All members of the Enterobacteriaceae possess distinct 5'-nucleotidases and cyclic phosphodiesterases (3'-nucleotidases) that can be differentiated from the acid and alkaline phosphatases and the acid sugar hydrolases. The nucleotidases and cyclic phosphodiesterases of the various Enterobacteriaceae are remarkably similar in properties. All of the 5'-nucleotidases hydrolyze 5'-nucleotides, adenosine triphosphate, and uridine diphosphoglucose. Their pH optimum is from 5.7 to 6.1. The cyclic phosphodiesterases hydrolyze 3'-nucleotides, cyclic phosphonucleotides, bis-(p-nitrophenyl)phosphate, and p-nitrophenylphosphate. Their pH optimum is from 7.2 to 7.8. For both enzymes, cobalt showed optimal metal stimulation. An intracellular protein inhibitor for the 5'-nucleotidase is present in all of the Enterobacteriaceae. No inhibitor of cyclic phosphodiesterase activity exists, although hydrolysis of both cyclic phosphonucleotides and 3'-nucleotides is inhibited by ribonucleic acid. Neither of the enzymes is subject to control by phosphate level or by catabolite repression. Of the other bacteria studied, only Haemophilus and Bacillus subtilis contained significant 3'- or 5'-nucleotidase activity.

TI  - Ultraviolet irradiation of DNA in vitro and in vivo produces a 3d thymine-derived product.
AB  - A new thymine-derived product was separated from DNA irradiated with utlraviolet  light in vitro and in vivo. This compound was mistaken to be thymine homodiner (T=T) by other workers because it is chromatographically indistinguishable from T=T in most eluents. It has absorbancy maximums at 312, 312, and 300 millimicrons in neutral, pH 2, and pH 11 aqueous solutions, respectively. When it is irradiated in aqueous solution with wavelengths of 360 and 313 millimicrons its spectrum reverts to one similar to that of thymine. Therefore, at least three thymine-derived products can be detected in ultraviolet irradiated DNA, namely the homodimer, a material with absorbancy maximum at 312 millimicrons, and a "minor" product suggested by others to be a dimer of cytosine and thymine. In cells, the latter two are formed in aboult equal amounts. While these three products were shown to exist in the acid hydrolyzates of ultraviolet irradiated DNA, a material with absorbancy maximum at about 310 millimicrons was demonstrated to form in ultraviolet irradiated DNA without further treatment. The magnitude of this spectral increase varied directly with the incrcase in the adenine-thymine contents in the DNA as shlown by differential transmittance spectra of the irradiated Micrococcus lysodeikticus, calf thymus, Bacillus cereus, and Hemophilus influenzae DNA.

AB  - Heat-killed strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus albus can induce  in guinea pigs a state of altered reactivity to skin homografts which is indistinguishable from that which results from sensitization with homologous tissues or Group A streptococci. Challenge of suitably prepared recipients with first-set skin homografts obtained from unrelated randomly selected donors elicits white graft reactions or accelerated rejection of such grafts. Other bacteria tested included Lancefield streptococcal groups B, C, D, E, G, H, L, and O, pneumococcus Types II, III, XIV and a rough strain, Corynebacterium xerosis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Aerobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus vulgaris, Neisseria catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and two human virulent strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. None of these microorganisms was active in the induction of homograft sensitivity in the guinea pig. Pretreatment of recipients with Gram-negative bacterial suspensions was associated with a slight increase in the mean survival time of first-set skin homografts. Results of this study suggest the presence in staphylococci, as well as in Group A streptococci, of antigens related in their biologic effects to tissue transplantation antigens.

AB  - Barnhart, Benjamin J. (Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health, Baltimore, Md.). Residual activity of thermally denatured transforming deoxyribonucleic acid from Haemophilus influenzae. J. Bacteriol. 89:1271-1279. 1965.-The level of residual transforming activity of heated deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (i.e., 1 to a few per cent of native DNA-transforming activity) was found to be independent of the heating and quenching temperatures and less susceptible than native or renatured DNA to heat inactivation upon prolonged heating above or below the critical melting temperature. Similar dose-response curves were obtained for inactivation by formamide of native and renatured DNA, but the residual-active material was much more resistant. Heating DNA above the T(m) in the presence of 1% formaldehyde resulted in a level of residual activity 4 logs lower than that obtained without formaldehyde. Residual-active material was not inactivated by Escherichia coli phosphodiesterase, but it was susceptible to snake venom phosphodiesterase. A new genetic marker was induced in heated-quenched DNA but not in purified residual-active material following nitrous acid treatment. Residual activity was found to be less susceptible to ultraviolet inactivation and to band at a higher density region in CsCl than native DNA. In conclusion, it is suggested that the residual-active material is a structure formed by intrastrand hydrogen bonding of the separated units of heated-quenched DNA. Such a configuration would result in at least a partially double-stranded structure, which is probably the essential characteristic of the residual-active material endowing it with biological activity.

AB  - Sixty-eight children with acute purulent meningitis were treated at The Hospital  for Sick Children, Toronto, in 1962; nine deaths occurred. Hemophilus influenzae type B and meningitis in which no organism was cultured accounted for 35 and 17 cases, respectively. A number of other etiological agents caused six or fewer cases each.The principal presenting complaints were fever and vomiting, the more familiar symptoms of meningeal irritation occurring in 20% or less. A short duration of onset suggested a more severe illness and graver prognosis. Seven of the nine fatal cases had a presenting history of less than 24 hours' duration. Persisting high fever, convulsions, cyanosis and abdominal distension were also associated more specifically with the fatal cases.The laboratory examination of the initial spinal fluid sample, while of value in the identification of the causative organism, was not of prognostic value.The value of general treatment measures, as well as specific therapy, was evident in all cases.

The relative activities, the pH optima, and the effect of metal ions were investigated. It was concluded that bacterial 3- and 5-nucleotidases are distinct and separate enzymes.

TI  - Photoreactivation of transforming DNA by an enzyme from bakers' yeast.
AB  - Ultraviolet-inactivated Hemophilus influenzae transforming DNA recovers its activity when mixed with cell-free extracts of bakers' yeast and exposed to visible light. The active agent in the extract is not used up in the reaction, and purification has not separated it into more than one non-dialyzable component. It differs from the agent in Escherichia coli extract, which produces very similar photoreactivation, but which can be resolved into non-dialyzable and dialyzable components, the latter being used up during illumination. The yeast agent can be salted out of solution and recovered quantitatively; it is inactivated by crystalline trypsin and chymotrypsin and by brief heating at 60 degrees C.-all facts suggesting that it is an enzyme for which ultraviolet lesions in the DNA serve as substrate. The kinetics of recovery are also consistent with such an assumption. This enzyme is unusual both because it is involved in a light-dependent reaction and because it has a non-destructive action on DNA outside an intact cell.
TI  - Photoreactivation in vitro of ultraviolet-inactivated Hemophilus influenzae transforming factor.
AB  - Hemophilus influenzae-transforming DNA, which has been inactivated by ultra-violet radiation, is reactivated by visible light in the presence of a cell-free extract of Escherichia coli B. The time rate of reactivation is increased by increasing the E. coli extract concentration, the temperature, and the intensity of illumination. Only DNA containing an ultraviolet-damaged genetic marker exhibits increased transforming activity after treatment with the photoreactivating system. The reactivating capacity of the extract remains in the top supernatant after centrifugation at 110,000 x g for 1 hour and is not present in the pellet. This capacity is destroyed by heating to 90 degrees C. for 1 minute. The active system of the E. coli extract is separable into dialyzable, heat-stable and non-dialyzable, heat-labile fractions. The dialyzable fraction contains at least one component which limits the maximum degree of recovery attained.
