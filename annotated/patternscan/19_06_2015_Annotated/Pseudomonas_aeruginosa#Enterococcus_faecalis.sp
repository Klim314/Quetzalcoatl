TI  == antimicrobial impacts of essential oils on food borne-pathogens.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of twelve essential oil (pine oil, eucalyptus, thyme,  sage tea, lavender, orange, laurel, lemon, myrtle, lemon, rosemary and juniper) was tested by a disc diffusion method against food borne pathogens (escherichia coli, salmonella paratyphi a, klebsiella pneumoniae, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila, campylobacter jejuni, enterococcus  faecalis, staphylococcus aureus). the major components in essential oils were monoterpenes hydrocarbons, alpha-pinene, limonene; monoterpene phenol, carvacrol  and oxygenated monoterpenes, camphor, 1,8-cineole, eucalyptol, linalool and linalyl acetate. although the antimicrobial effect of essential oils varied depending on the chemical composition of the essential oils and specific microorganism tested, majority of the oils exhibited antibacterial activity against one or more strains. the essential oil with the lowest inhibition zones was juniper with the values varied from 1.5 to 6 mm. however, the components of essential oil of thyme and pine oil are highly active against food borne pathogen, generating the largest inhibition zones for both gram negative and positive bacteria (5.25-28.25 mm vs. 12.5-30 mm inhibition zones). these results  indicate the possibility use of the essential oils on food system as antimicrobial agents against food-borne pathogen. the article also offers some promising patents on applications of essential oils on food industry as antimicrobial agent.

TI  == statins and antimicrobial effects: simvastatin as a potential drug against staphylococcus aureus biofilm.
AB  == statins are important lipid-lowering agents with other pleiotropic effects. several studies have explored a possible protective effect of statins to reduce the morbidity and mortality of many infectious diseases. staphylococcus aureus is one of the main pathogens implicated in nosocomial infections; its ability to form biofilms makes treatment difficult. the present study observed the mic of atorvastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin against s. aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis. simvastatin was the only  agent with activity against clinical isolates and reference strains of methicilin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa) and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). thus, the effects of simvastatin on the growth, viability and biofilm formation of s. aureus were tested. in addition, a possible synergistic effect between simvastatin and vancomycin was evaluated. simvastatin's mic was 15.65 microg/ml for s. aureus 29213 and 31.25 microg/ml for the other strains of s. aureus. the effect of simvastatin was bactericidal at 4xmic and bacteriostatic at the mic concentration. no synergistic effect was found between simvastatin and vancomycin. however, the results obtained against s. aureus biofilms showed that, in addition to inhibiting adhesion and biofilm formation at concentrations from 1/16xmic to 4xmic, simvastatin was also able to act against mature biofilms, reducing cell viability and extra-polysaccharide production. in conclusion, simvastatin showed pronounced antimicrobial activity against s. aureus biofilms,  reducing their formation and viability.

TI  == identification of enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa on and in implants in individuals with peri-implant disease: a cross-sectional study.
AB  == purpose: to verify whether the parts of dental implants can be contaminated by opportunistic pathogens. materials and methods: in this cross-sectional study, 38 individuals (52 implants) were investigated. samples for microbiologic analysis (for a total of 180 sites) were obtained from each individual, from three types of sites in the following order: (1) the peri-implant sulcus of each implant, (2) the gingival sulcus of adjacent teeth, and (3) inside the implant-abutment connection and the abutment of each implant. swabs from the oral mucosa (cheeks,  tongue, and pharynx) were also collected. quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was carried out for total bacterial counts of enterococcus faecalis and  pseudomonas aeruginosa. two-way analysis of variance (sites, species) and holm-sidak tests were used for statistical analyses. results: no opportunistic bacteria were found in the gingival sulcus specimens (38 sites). e faecalis was detected in the peri-implant sulcus (3 of 52 sites) and the inner connection/abutment portion (3 of 52 sites). p aeruginosa was identified only in  the oral mucosa swabs (1 of 38 sites) and represented the highest bacterial number (3.5 x 10(6)). statistically significant differences were only found between species and in the peri-implant sulcus. conclusion: within the limitations of this study, significant differences in the presence and levels of  nosocomial bacteria were detected in the peri-implant environment of diseased implants. from a clinical point of view, data from this study might suggest that, in patients affected by peri-implantitis, prostheses should be removed and the implant-abutment connection disinfected routinely, along with implant surface decontamination.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of the essential oils of portuguese foeniculum vulgare fruits.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation from fruits of six fennel accessions collected from wild populations occurring in the  centre and south of portugal. composition of essential oils was established by gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (gc-fid) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) analysis. the obtained yields of the essential oils were found to vary greatly in the range of 1.1 to 2.9% (v/w) and the chemical composition varied with the region of collection. a total of 16 compounds were identified. the main compounds were fenchone (16.9 - 34.7%), estragole (2.5 - 66.0%) and trans-anethole (7.9 - 77.7%). the percentages of these three main compounds were used to determine the relationship between the different oil samples and to group them into four different chemotypes: anethole/fenchone; anethole; estragole and anethole/estragole. antifungal activity of essential oils was evaluated against six food spoilage fungi: aspergillus niger, a. japonicus, a. oryzae, fusarium oxysporum, rhizophus oryzae and r. stolonifer. antibacterial  activity was assessed against three gram-positive strains: enterococcus faecalis  atcc 29212, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228 and s. aureus atcc 28213; and against six gram-negative strains: escherichia coli atcc 25922; morganella morganii lfg 08; proteus mirabilis lfg 04; salmonella enteritidis lfg 05; s. entiritidis serovar typhimurium lfg 06 and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 by the disc diffusion agar method; the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined using the broth macro-dilution method. the mic values varied from 62.5 (e. coli atcc 25922) to 2000 microml (p. aeruginosa atcc 27853).

TI  == polyamine derivatives of betulinic acid and beta-sitosterol: a comparative investigation.
AB  == beta-sitosterol and betulinic acid were used in designing their conjugates with selected polyamines bearing either an amide bond, or an ester and an amide bond simultaneously in the target molecule. the synthesized compounds were subjected to basic cytotoxic and antimicrobial tests. the synthetic protocol is described separately for each of the three series of the target amides, because each series of compounds required a different synthetic approach. the cytotoxicity was tested on cells derived from human t-lymphoblastic leukemia, breast adenocarcinoma and cervical cancer, and compared with the tests on normal human fibroblasts. most of the target compounds (5a-5c, 11a-11c and 16a-16c) showed medium to high cytotoxicity (0.7-7.8mum), however, in some cases the compounds showed high cytotoxicity even toward normal human fibroblasts (11a-11c). two compounds of this series (11c and 16c) also displayed antimicrobial activity with high and selective microbe specificity. the compound 11c was potent against escherichia coli (minimal inhibition concentration (mic) 6.25mugml(-1), i.e. 9.75nmml(-1)) and staphylococcus aureus (mic 12.5mugml(-1), i.e. 19.5nmml(-1)), and showed medium activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. the compound 16c was highly active against enterococcus faecalis and s. aureus (both, mic 3.125mugml(-1), i.e. 4.22nmml(-1)), both gram-positive bacteria, however showed only weak activity against e. coli and no activity against p. aeruginosa, both gram-negative bacteria, which indicates possible microbe specificity of 16c. comparing beta-sitosterol-based series (5a-5c) and betulinic acid series (11a-11c and 16a-16c) of the target compounds, the latter one gave more promising structures. the compounds 11c and 16c showed effects which may be described as multifarious activity (pleiotropic effects).

TI  == preparation, characterization and antibacterial properties of zno/kaoline nanocomposites.
AB  == this paper describes laboratory preparation, characterization and antibacterial activity testing of zno/kaoline composites. zno/kaoline composites with 50wt.% of zno were laboratory prepared, dried at 105 degrees c and calcined at 500 degrees  c. xrpd analysis revealed that thermal treatment caused the phase transformation  of zn containing precursor into zno. scanning and transmission electron microscopy techniques were used for characterization of morphology of the prepared samples. a standard microdilution test was used for evaluation of antibacterial activity using four common human pathogens (staphylococcus aureus,  escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa). daylight was used for induction photocatalytically based antibacterial activity. second possible explanation of antibacterial activity of zno/kaoline could be the presence of biologically available forms of zinc. during the antibacterial activity assays the zno/kaoline composites exhibited antibacterial activity, where differences in an onset of the antibacterial activity and activity against  bacterial strains were observed. the highest antibacterial activity was observed  against s. aureus, where the lowest value of minimum inhibitory concentration was determined equal to 0.41mg/ml.

TI  == incidence, risk factors, microbiology of venous catheter associated bloodstream infections--a prospective study from a tertiary care hospital.
AB  == purpose: central venous catheters (cvcs) though indispensable in current medical  and intensive care treatment, also puts patients at risk of catheter related infection (cri) resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. we analysed the incidence, risk factors, bacteriological profile and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the isolates in central venous catheter associated bloodstream infection (cvc-bsi) in the intensive care unit (icu) patients and studied the formation of biofilm in cvcs. materials and methods: the following case control study included 115 patients with cvc in situ. quantitative blood cultures (qbc) and catheter tip cultures were performed for the diagnoses. direct catheter staining was done for an early diagnosis by acridine orange (ao) and gram staining methods. biofilm production in catheters was detected by 'tissue culture plate' (tcp) method. the results were analysed using the computer-based program statistical package for the social sciences (spss). results: in 25/115 patients,  definite diagnosis of cvc-bsi was made. the mean age was 48.44 +/- 17.34 years (cases) vs 40.10 +/- 18.24 years (controls) and the mean duration of catheterisation was 25.72 +/- 8.73 days (cases) vs 11.89 +/- 6.38 days (controls). local signs of infection (erythema, tenderness and oozing) were found more significantly in cvc-bsi cases. the ao staining was more sensitive and gram  staining of catheters showed higher specificity. staphylococcus aureus followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa and non-albicans candida were common cvc-bsi pathogens. multidrug-resistant (mdr) strains were isolated in bacterial agents of cvc-bsi. non-albicans candida and enterococcus faecalis showed strong biofilm production.  conclusion: the incidence of cvc-bsi was 21.73% and the rate was 14.59 per 1000 catheter days. prolonged icu stay and longer catheterisation were major risk factors. s. aureus was isolated most commonly in cvc-bsi cases. the menace of multidrug resistance and biofilm formation in cvcs is associated with cvc-bsi.

TI  == bactericidal activity of curcumin i is associated with damaging of bacterial membrane.
AB  == curcumin, an important constituent of turmeric, is known for various biological activities, primarily due to its antioxidant mechanism. the present study focused on the antibacterial activity of curcumin i, a significant component of commercial curcumin, against four genera of bacteria, including those that are gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa). these represent prominent human pathogens, particularly in hospital settings. our study shows the strong antibacterial potential of curcumin i against all the tested bacteria from gram-positive as well as gram-negative groups. the integrity of the bacterial membrane was checked using two differential permeabilization indicating fluorescent probes, namely, propidium iodide and calcein. both the membrane permeabilization assays confirmed membrane leakage in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria on exposure to curcumin i. in addition, scanning electron  microscopy and fluorescence microscopy were employed to confirm the membrane damages in bacterial cells on exposure to curcumin i. the present study confirms  the broad-spectrum antibacterial nature of curcumin i, and its membrane damaging  property. findings from this study could provide impetus for further research on  curcumin i regarding its antibiotic potential against rapidly emerging bacterial  pathogens.

TI  == adenosine tri-phosphate (atp)-based cleaning monitoring in health care: how rapidly does environmental atp deteriorate?
AB  == background: ensuring cleaning compliance of housekeeping staff is critical to ensure adequate application of surface disinfectants. adenosine triphosphate (atp) testing has been recommended as a way to monitor cleaning compliance; however, little is known about the stability of atp on environmental surfaces. aim: to assess the stability of atp from various sources to determine if it is stable for sufficient time to be an effective means of assessing environmental cleaning and disinfection in health care. methods: purified atp, atp derived from ats-t (blood-based test soil) and atp derived from 10(7) colony-forming units/site of micro-organisms (pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans) were evaluated in liquid suspension and dried on to surfaces to assess stability over 29 days. cleaners and disinfectants were sprayed on to surface-dried material with no wiping to determine their effect on microbial viability and atp stability. findings: surface-dried p. aeruginosa, e. faecalis and c. albicans retained 65-96% of their original atp level on day 29, despite reduced or no viability. surface-dried ats-t had 100% and 3% of its original atp  on days 4 and 29, respectively. deterioration of the atp signal was most pronounced for suspensions. purified atp was stable over 29 days in suspension or dried on to a surface. conclusions: atp residuals from organic material and micro-organisms (dead or alive) are stable when dried on to surfaces. in the absence of cleaning and disinfection, the relative light unit signal will not deteriorate rapidly, making atp a good marker to monitor cleaning.

TI  == bacteriological findings and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of isolated pathogens from visual threatening ocular infections.
AB  == objective: to study the profiles and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of isolated bacteria from visual threatening ocular infection. material and method:  this is a retrospective review of all microbiological culture reports from visual threatening ocular infection patients admitted at king chulalongkorn memorial hospital from 2005 to 2009. the culture reports with antimicrobial susceptibility pattern were analyzed and correlated with clinical presentation. results: there were 682 specimens from 282 patients (286 eyes). three most common diagnoses were corneal ulcer, endophthalmitis and scleritis, which yielded positive culture of 31.1% (38/122 eyes), 24.2% (25/103 eyes), and 55.6% (5/9 eyes), respectively. overall, positive cultures were demonstrated from 77 eyes (27%). pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common causative pathogens of corneal ulcer and scleritis, while enterococcus faecalis was the most common pathogens of endophthalmitis. all isolated pseudomonas spp. were susceptible to ciprofloxacin  with 4% resistance to both gentamicin and amikacin. enterococcus faecalis demonstrated 50% of intermediate resistance to ciprofloxacin. there was no methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus identified. conclusion: overall positive cultures obtained from visual threatening ocular infection from a 5 year-review were 27%. microbial profile remained stable from 2005 to 2009, and antimicrobial resistance was not obviously observed in our study. the findings may be used as guidelines for the prompt management of antimicrobial agents used  in presumed severe bacterial ocular infection, in order to prevent devastating ocular tissue damage.

TI  == in vitro activity of gentamicin, vancomycin or amikacin combined with edta or l-arginine as lock therapy against a wide spectrum of biofilm-forming clinical strains isolated from catheter-related infections.
AB  == objectives: treatment of catheter-related bloodstream infections (crbsi) is hampered by the characteristic tolerance of bacterial biofilms towards antibiotics. our objective was to study the effect of the combination of antibiotics and the alkaline amino acid l-arginine or the cation chelator edta on the bacterial killing of in vitro biofilms formed by an array of clinical strains responsible for crbsi and representative of epidemiologically relevant bacterial  species. methods: among 32 strains described in a previous clinical study, we focused on the most antibiotic-tolerant strains including cons (n = 4), staphylococcus aureus (n = 4), enterococcus faecalis (n = 2), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4) and enterobacteriaceae (n = 4). we used an in vitro biofilm model (96-well plate assay) to study biofilm tolerance and tested various combinations of antibiotics and non-antibiotic adjuvants. gentamicin, amikacin or vancomycin was combined with disodium edta or l-arginine for 24 h to reproduce the antibiotic lock therapy (alt) approach. killing of biofilm bacteria was measured by cfu quantification after a vigorous step of pipetting up and down in  order to detach all biofilm bacteria from the surface of the wells. results: both of our adjuvant strategies significantly increased the effect of antibiotics against biofilms formed by gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens. the combination of gentamicin + edta was active against all tested strains apart  from one p. aeruginosa. the combination of gentamicin + l-arginine was active against most of the tested strains with the notable exception of cons for which no potentiation was observed. we also demonstrated that amikacin + edta was active against gram-negative bacteria and that vancomycin + edta was active against gram-positive bacteria. conclusions: the addition of edta enhanced the activity of gentamicin, amikacin and vancomycin against biofilms formed by a wide spectrum of bacterial strains responsible for crbsi.

TI  == nonselective mevalonate kinase inhibitor as a novel class of antibacterial agents.
AB  == introduction. there are a few evidences about targeting isoprenoids biosynthesis  pathway in bacteria for finding new antibiotics. this study was conducted to assess antibacterial effects of vanadyl sulfate (vs), one of the mevalonate kinase inhibitors to find a new target for killing bacteria. materials and methods. antibacterial effect of vs alone and in combination with glycine or edta was assessed on escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa as gram-negative and  staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis as gram-positive bacteria using serial dilution method and minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) identified. result. mics for s. aureus and e. coli were 4 and 8 mg/ml, respectively. vs could not affect the growth of two other bacteria. however, vs in combination with glycine not only inhibited the growth of e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa, but also  reduced mics for vs-sensitive bacteria (s. aureus and e. coli). edta could reduce mic for e. coli and p. aeruginosa. conclusion. vs could inhibit the growth of s.  aurous and e. coli, and adding glycine or edta improved vs antibacterial activity presumably via instability of the cell wall and enhanced transport of vs through  bacterial cell wall. inhibition of the isoprenoid pathway might provide new tools to overcome bacterial resistance.

TI  == antimicrobial and antifungal activity of pelargonium roseum essential oils.
AB  == purpose: the antiseptic qualities of aromatic and medicinal plants and their extracts have been recognized since antiquity, while attempts to characterize these properties in the laboratory date back the beginning of the xx(th) century. in the current study essential oils obtained from pelargonium roseum (geraniacea) were analyzed for their antibacterial and antifungal activities. methods: the antimicrobial activity of the pelargonium essential oil was tested against gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli), gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis) and  fungi (candida albicans). disc diffusion method was used to study antimicrobial activity. results: inhibition zones showed that the studied essential oils were active against all of the studied bacteria. in the case of candida albicans, the  complete inhibition of the fungus's development was observed. in the cases of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus we observed an inhibition comparable to that obtained by the use of an appropriate antimicrobial substance. conclusion: the volatile oils exhibited considerable inhibitory effects against all the organisms under test, in some cases comparable with those of the reference antibiotics. there were no considerable differences between the antimicrobial activities of the oil obtained by distillation and commercially available pelargonium oils.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides expressed in medicinal maggots of the blow fly lucilia sericata show combinatorial activity against bacteria.
AB  == the larvae of the common green bottle fly (lucilia sericata) produce antibacterial secretions that have a therapeutic effect on chronic and nonhealing wounds. recent developments in insect biotechnology have made it possible to use  these larvae as a source of novel anti-infectives. here, we report the application of next-generation rna sequencing (rna-seq) to characterize the transcriptomes of the larval glands, crop, and gut, which contribute to the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides (amps) and proteins secreted into wounds. our data confirm that l. sericata larvae have adapted in order to colonize microbially contaminated habitats, such as carrion and necrotic wounds, and are protected against infection by a diverse spectrum of amps. l. sericata amps include not only lucifensin and lucimycin but also novel attacins, cecropins, diptericins, proline-rich peptides, and sarcotoxins. we identified 47 genes encoding putative amps and produced 23 as synthetic analogs, among which some displayed activities against a broad spectrum of microbial pathogens, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris, and enterococcus faecalis. against escherichia coli (gram negative) and micrococcus luteus (gram positive), we found mostly additive effects but also synergistic activity when selected amps were tested in combination. the amps that are easy to synthesize are currently being produced in bulk to allow their evaluation as novel anti-infectives that can be formulated in hydrogels to produce therapeutic wound dressings and adhesive bandages.

TI  == bactericidal activity and mechanism of photoirradiated polyphenols against gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
AB  == the bactericidal effect of various types of photoirradiated polyphenols against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was evaluated in relation to the mode of action. gram-positive bacteria (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus mutans) and gram-negative bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) suspended in a 1 mg/ml polyphenol aqueous solution (caffeic acid, gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, and proanthocyanidin) were exposed to led light (wavelength, 400 nm; irradiance, 260 mw/cm2) for 5 or 10 min. caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid exerted the highest bactericidal activity  followed by gallic acid and proanthocyanidin against both gram-positive and -negative bacteria. it was also demonstrated that the disinfection treatment induced oxidative damage of bacterial dna, which suggests that polyphenols are incorporated into bacterial cells. the present study suggests that blue light irradiation of polyphenols could be a novel disinfection treatment.

TI  == utilization of blood cultures in danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  == this national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (bcs). a primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. from the danish microbiology database, we retrieved all bcs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the national patient registry. in total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one bc was taken. almost 50% of bcs were taken at admission. the chance of having a bc taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one bc  was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. ten species, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. an increase in bcs and positive bcs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. bcs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for s. pneumoniae particularly. a predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to s. aureus, e. faecium and k. pneumoniae. minor differences in bcs and positive bcs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. the study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of different disinfection methods against biofilms in root canals.
AB  == aim: the aim of the present study was to evaluate the bactericidal effects of different disinfection methods against microbial biofilms grown in root canals. methods: a total of 300 freshly-extracted human teeth were infected with microbial pathogens. the biofilm formation and the effects of laser therapy, photodynamic therapy (pdt), iontophoresis, and disinfection with irrigating solutions were evaluated by counting the generations of microbial cells in the samples of root canals and by scanning electron microscopy. results: enterococcus faecalis and other gram-positive cocci demonstrated highest sensitivity to the methods of antibacterial action compared here. in most of the cases observed, the antibacterial treatment was less effective against gram-negative bacteria in dental biofilms. the biofilms that were most difficult to eliminate were those formed by pseudomonas aeruginosa. iontophoresis treatment with iodine and chemical disinfection with hypochlorite and chlorhexidine demonstrated the most powerful bactericidal effect. when pdt was applied with fotosan as a photosensitizer, better disinfection was achieved in comparison to the other lasers alone. conclusion: the comparison of these different strategies for endodontic treatment showed that hypochlorite, followed by the chlorhexidine irrigant in our experimental conditions, gave the most satisfactory results against the formation of bacterial biofilms in the root canals.

TI  == diagnostic and therapeutic utility of transrectal ultrasound in urological office prostatic abscess management: a short report from a single urologic center.
AB  == objectives: prostatic abscess (pa) is an infrequent condition in the modern antibiotic era. the everyday use of transrectal ultrasound (trus) during diagnostic work-up and the widespread recurrence to prostatic biopsies may lead to an increase of pa diagnosis. in this short report we analyze the patients characteristics and the management of seven recent cases of pa diagnosed in our institution. materials and methods: the records of 7 patients admitted to our center for luts associated to septic fever or acute urinary retention, was prospectively collected. suspect of pa was done on digital rectal examination (dre) and confirmed by trus performed after urinary system ultrasound (uus) evaluation. patients were admitted to hospital only in case of septic signs. a sovrapubic (spc) or urethral catheter (uc) was placed depending on symptoms. a trus-guided aspiration of pa was performed with patient in lithotomic position, using a 18 gauge two-part needle, side/end fire needle access. patient was discharged with antibiotic therapy and followed up until complete resolution of the pa and symptoms. results: mean age was 62 years (range 24-82). two patients were diabetics and one was affected by the immunodeficiency acquired syndrome (hiv). in one case, pa was detected after a persistent fever post trus guided prostate biopsy. average prostate volume was 69 ml (range 19-118 ml). dre was able to diagnose pa only in 2 cases (29%), uus evaluation in 1 case (14%). all cases were confirmed by trus as hypo-anechoic areas with or without internal echoes in all patients. mean pa dimension was 3.64 cm (range 1.5-8). spc was placed in 3 cases (43%), uc in 3 patients (43%). only 1 patient refused catheterization. side fire needle aspiration was performed in all cases and in combination with end fire access in case of particular location of abscess cavities. second look was needed in 2 cases (29%). antibiotics were administered  in all cases. the aspirated pus showed a positive culture for escherichia coli (43%), klebsiella pneumoniae (29%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (14%) and enterococcus faecalis (14%). pa resolution time mean was 9 days (range 3-24). conclusions: trus evaluation in case of persistent luts associated with fever or acute urinary retention is determinant in the diagnosis of pa. office or institutional management with trus needle aspiration is a good option in these cases.

TI  == microbiological characterization of aquatic microbiomes targeting taxonomical marker genes and antibiotic resistance genes of opportunistic bacteria.
AB  == the dissemination of medically relevant antibiotic resistance genes (args) (blavim-1, vana, ampc, ermb, and meca) and opportunistic bacteria (enterococcus faecium/faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, and cns) was determined in different anthropogenically influenced aquatic habitats in a selected region of germany. over a period of two years, four differently sized wastewater treatment plants (wwtps) with and without clinical influence, three surface waters, four rain overflow basins, and three groundwater sites were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr). results were calculated in cell equivalents per 100 ng of total dna extracted from water  samples and per 100 ml sample volume, which seems to underestimate the abundance  of antibiotic resistance and opportunistic bacteria. high abundances of opportunistic bacteria and arg were quantified in clinical wastewaters and influents of the adjacent wwtp. the removal capacities of wwtp were up to 99% for some, but not all investigated bacteria. the abundances of most arg targets were  found to be increased in the bacterial population after conventional wastewater treatment. as a consequence, downstream surface water and also some groundwater compartments displayed high abundances of all four args. it became obvious that the dynamics of the arg differed from the fate of the opportunistic bacteria. this underlines the necessity of an advanced microbial characterization of anthropogenically influenced environments.

TI  == antibiotic resistance prevalence in routine bloodstream isolates from children's  hospitals varies substantially from adult surveillance data in europe.
AB  == background: surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (amr) is central for defining appropriate strategies to deal with changing amr levels. it is unclear whether childhood amr patterns differ from those detected in isolates from adult  patients. methods: resistance percentages of nonduplicate staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream isolates from children less than 18 years of age reported to the antibiotic resistance and prescribing in european children (arpec) project were compared with all-age resistance percentages reported by the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance network (ears-net) for the same pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, period and countries. in addition, resistance percentages were compared between arpec isolates from children less than 1 year of age and children greater than or equal to1 year of age. results: resistance percentages for many important pathogen-antibiotic class combinations were different for arpec isolates compared with ears-net. e. coli and k. pneumoniae fluoroquinolone  resistance percentages were substantially lower in arpec (13.4% and 17.9%) than in ears-net (23.0% and 30.7%), whereas the reverse was true for all pathogen-antibiotic class combinations in p. aeruginosa (for example, 27.3% aminoglycoside resistance in arpec, 19.3% in ears-net, 32.8% carbapenem resistance in arpec and 20.5% in ears-net), and for s. pneumoniae and macrolide resistance. for many gram-negative pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, isolates from children greater than or equal to 1 year of age showed higher resistance percentages than isolates from children less than 1 year of age. conclusions: age-stratified presentation of resistance percentage estimates by surveillance programs will allow identification of important variations in resistance patterns between different patient groups for targeted intervention.

AB  == cationic amphipathic alpha-helical peptides are intensively studied classes of host defence peptides (hdps). three peptides, peptide glycine-leucine-amide (pgla-am1), caerulein-precursor fragment (cpf-am1) and magainin-am1, originally isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the african volcano frog xenopus amieti (pipidae), were studied for their antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities against oral and respiratory pathogens. minimal effective concentrations (mecs), determined by radial diffusion assay, were generally lower than minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) determined by microbroth dilution. pgla-am1 and cpf-am1 were particularly active against streptococcus mutans and all three peptides were effective against fusobacterium  nucleatum, whereas enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans proved to be relatively resistant micro-organisms. a type strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa was shown to be more susceptible than the clinical isolate studied. pgla-am1 displayed the greatest propensity to bind lipopolysaccharide (lps) from escherichia coli, p. aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. all three peptides  showed less binding to p. gingivalis lps than to lps from the other species studied. oral fibroblast viability was unaffected by 50 mum peptide treatments. production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine il-8 by oral fibroblasts was significantly increased following treatment with 1 or 10 mum magainin-am1 but not following treatment with pgla-am1 or cpf-am1. in conclusion, as well as possessing potent antimicrobial actions, the x. amieti peptides bound to lps from three human pathogens and had no effect on oral fibroblast viability. cpf-am1 and pgla-am1 show promise as templates for the design of novel analogues for the treatment of oral and dental diseases associated with bacteria or fungi.

TI  == the question of pathogen quantification in disinfected graywater.
AB  == graywater (gw) reuse for irrigation is recognized as a sustainable solution for water conservation. one of the major impediments to gw reuse is the presence of pathogenic microorganisms. this study monitored three similar on-site gw treatment systems bi-monthly over the course of a year to compare the presence of pathogens and indicators in raw, biologically treated, and biologically treated and disinfected [by chlorine and ultraviolet light (uv)] gw. the systems were designed to allow the testing of the same batch (collection) of water as it passed through the treatment chain. the samples were analyzed using standard culture-dependent methods and the data were compared to culture-independent dna-based methods. results suggested that the presence and abundance of fecal coliforms, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, enterococcus spp., staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa differ among the various gw streams (e.g. raw, biologically treated, and disinfected). the culture-dependent  analyses suggested that both chlorine and uv inactivate most of the bacteria tested in the biologically treated gw, albeit at different efficiencies. conversely, the dna-based analyses indicated no significant differences in pathogenic bacterial abundance between the biologically treated gw with or without disinfection. to better understand the discrepancies between the results, we repeated the analysis in the laboratory under controlled conditions using enterococcus faecalis as a model bacterium and obtained similar results. we suggest that disinfection of biologically treated gw with chlorine or uv is effective for treating pathogens, but that the inactivation efficiency cannot be  estimated by dna-based qpcr.

TI  == pharmacological basis for the medicinal use of linum usitatissimum (flaxseed) in  infectious and non-infectious diarrhea.
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: linum usitatissimum, commonly known as flaxseed has traditionally been used for the management of diarrhea and gastrointestinal infections. this study was planned to assess pharmacological basis for the medicinal use of flaxseed in infectious and non-infectious diarrhea. materials and methods: the crude aqueous-methanolic extract of flaxseed was studied using the in vivo castor oil-induced diarrhea, gut motility and enteropooling assays. mechanistic basis was further elucidated by testing the inhibitory effect on spontaneously contracting isolated rabbit jejunum preparations, suspended in a 10ml tissue bath containing tyrode solution, maintained at 37 degrees c and aerated with carbogen. antibacterial efficacy of the flaxseed extract was tested  against different enteric and non-enteric pathogenic bacteria using in vitro antibacterial assays. results: flaxseed extract reduced the diarrheal score in mice, by 39%, 63.90% and 68.34% at the respective doses of 100, 300 and 500mg/kg. intestinal secretions were reduced by 24.12%, 28.09% and 38.80%, whereas the intestinal motility was reduced by 31.66%, 46.98% and 56.20% at respective doses  of 100, 300 and 500mg/kg. when tested on isolated rabbit jejunum preparations, flaxseed extract produced a dose-dependent inhibition of both spontaneous and high k(+) (80mm)-induced contractions, and shifted the concentration-response curves of ca(++) to the right with suppression of the maximum response, similar to that caused by verapamil. flaxseed extract was found to possess bactericidal activity at the tested concentrations of 12.5mg/ml, against vancomycin-resistant  enterococcus faecalis (100%), escherichia coli k1 (88.88%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (98.76%), bacillus cereus (92.64%), pseudomonas aeruginosa  (76.83%) and salmonella typhi (26.91+/-3.35%). the concentration of 10mg/ml showed bactericidal effects against all the aforementioned pathogens except escherichia coli k1, whereas for pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhi, it  was bacteriostatic at this concentration. conclusions: our results indicate that  linum usitatissimum (flaxseed) extract exhibits antidiarrheal and antispasmodic activities by virtue of its antimotility and antisecretory effects which are mediated possibly through inhibition of ca(++) channels, though additional mechanism(s) cannot be ruled out. flaxseed extract proved effective against both  enteric and non-enteric pathogens causing diarrhea, thus ensuring wide coverage and rationalizing its medicinal use in both the infectious and non-infectious diarrhea.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activity of hyperimmune globulin preparations against multiresistant nosocomial pathogens.
AB  == purpose: we compared different immunoglobulin preparations containing igg (intraglobin/intratect) or a mixture of igg, iga, and igm (pentaglobin) to assess the opsonic and protective efficacy of human immunoglobulin preparations against  multiresistent nosocomial pathogens. materials and methods: clinical isolates of  e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and staphylococcus aureus were tested by opsonophagocytic assay using immunologobulin preparations at dilutions usually obtained in patients. the target antigens of opsonic antibodies were characterized by opsonophagocytic inhibition assays, and the protective efficacy in vivo was tested in a mouse bacteremia model as previously described. results: all strains  were killed to at least 50% by pentaglobin. one p. aeruginosa strain was not efficiently killed by intraglobin (23%) but the other strains were killed by intraglobin to a similar degree compared to pentaglobin. opsonic igg antibodies against e. faecalis were directed against lta, while opsonic antibodies in pentaglobin were primarily directed against other cell wall carbohydrates. in a mouse bacteremia model, pentaglobin was more protective than intratect against staphylococcus aureus, while intratect reduced colony counts better than normal rabbit serum or saline. conclusions: all tested human immunoglobulin preparations contain opsonic and protective antibodies against targets present on multiresistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. enrichment of these preparations with igm increases the protective efficacy against some strains, probably due to antibodies directed against cell wall carbohydrates.

TI  == blood stream infections in renal transplant recipients: a single-center study.
AB  == introduction: bacteremias among renal transplant recipients are more frequent as  a result of immunosuppression. they are considered extremely high-risk because they are correlated with decreased allograft and recipient survival. patients and methods: all episodes of bacteremia among renal transplant recipients were documented following review of medical records, from january 2010 to may 2013. results: in total 26 episodes of bacteremia were observed in 22 patients. gram negative bacteremia was identified in 73% (19/26) cases. pathogens according to their frequency were the following escherichia coli (6/26, 23%), klebsiella pneumonia (5/26, 19%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (3/26, 11%), staphylococcus epidermidis (3/26, 11%), acinetobacter baumanni (2/26, 7.7%), enterococcus faecalis (2/26, 7.7%). the first trimester post renal transplantation 18 episodes (69%) of bacteremia were presented that were not correlated to indwelling urinary catheter or stent. positive urinary culture with the same pathogen was recognized in 13 patients. all recipients manifested fever, eight recipients had leucocytosis and three cases were complicated by septic shock. immediate resuscitation with intravenous fluids and non-nephrotoxic antibiotic regimen was  initiated. acute renal allograft dysfunction (defined as an increase in serum creatinine more than 0.5 mg/dl from baseline) was observed in five patients and was restored following infection resolution. conclusion: increased prevalence of  bacteremia in renal transplant recipients is attributed to immunosuppression and  usually bacteremic episodes follow urinary tract infection. the commonest pathogens are gram negative bacteria with e. coli the most frequent. early detection and proper management are important as bacteremia affects renal allograft and recipient survival.

TI  == lpxc inhibitors as new antibacterial agents and tools for studying regulation of  lipid a biosynthesis in gram-negative pathogens.
AB  == the problem of multidrug resistance in serious gram-negative bacterial pathogens  has escalated so severely that new cellular targets and pathways need to be exploited to avoid many of the preexisting antibiotic resistance mechanisms that  are rapidly disseminating to new strains. the discovery of small-molecule inhibitors of lpxc, the enzyme responsible for the first committed step in the biosynthesis of lipid a, represents a clinically unprecedented strategy to specifically act against gram-negative organisms such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and members of the enterobacteriaceae. in this report, we describe the microbiological characterization of lpxc-4, a recently disclosed inhibitor of this bacterial target, and demonstrate that its spectrum of activity extends to several of the pathogenic species that are most threatening to human health today. we also show that spontaneous generation of lpxc-4 resistance occurs at frequencies comparable to those seen with marketed antibiotics, and we provide an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms of resistance utilized by target pathogens. interestingly, these isolates also served as tools to further our understanding of the regulation of lipid a biosynthesis and enabled the discovery that this process occurs very distinctly between p. aeruginosa and members of the enterobacteriaceae. finally, we demonstrate that lpxc-4 is efficacious in vivo against multiple strains in different models of bacterial infection and that the  major first-step resistance mechanisms employed by the intended target organisms  can still be effectively treated with this new inhibitor. importance: new antibiotics are needed for the effective treatment of serious infections caused by gram-negative pathogens, and the responsibility of identifying new drug candidates rests squarely on the shoulders of the infectious disease community. the limited number of validated cellular targets and approaches, along with the increasing amount of antibiotic resistance that is spreading throughout the clinical environment, has prompted us to explore the utility of inhibitors of novel targets and pathways in these resistant organisms, since preexisting target-based resistance should be negligible. lipid a biosynthesis is an essential process for the formation of lipopolysaccharide, which is a critical component of the gram-negative outer membrane. in this report, we describe the in vitro and in vivo characterization of novel inhibitors of lpxc, an enzyme whose activity is required for proper lipid a biosynthesis, and demonstrate that our lead compound has the requisite attributes to warrant further consideration as a  novel antibiotic.

TI  == monotreme lactation protein is highly expressed in monotreme milk and provides antimicrobial protection.
AB  == monotremes (platypus and echidna) are the descendants of the oldest ancestor of all extant mammals distinguished from other mammals by mode of reproduction. monotremes lay eggs following a short gestation period and after an even briefer  incubation period, altricial hatchlings are nourished over a long lactation period with milk secreted by nipple-less mammary patches located on the female's  abdomen. milk is the sole source of nutrition and immune protection for the developing young until weaning. using transcriptome and mass spectrometry analysis of milk cells and milk proteins, respectively, a novel monotreme lactation protein (mlp) was identified as a major secreted protein in milk. we show that platypus and short-beaked echidna mlp genes show significant homology and are unique to monotremes. the mlp transcript was shown to be expressed in a variety of tissues; however, highest expression was observed in milk cells and was expressed constitutively from early to late lactation. analysis of recombinant mlp showed that it is an n-linked glycosylated protein and biophysical studies predicted that mlp is an amphipathic, alpha-helical protein,  a typical feature of antimicrobial proteins. functional analysis revealed mlp antibacterial activity against both opportunistic pathogenic staphylococcus aureus and commensal enterococcus faecalis bacteria but showed no effect on escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and salmonella enterica. our data suggest that mlp is an evolutionarily ancient component of milk-mediated innate immunity absent in other mammals. we propose that mlp evolved specifically in the monotreme lineage supporting the evolution of lactation in these species to provide bacterial protection, at a time when mammals lacked nipples.

TI  == development of a calcium phosphate nanocomposite for fast fluorogenic detection of bacteria.
AB  == current procedures for the detection and identification of bacterial infections are laborious, time-consuming, and require a high workload and well-equipped laboratories. therefore the work presented herein developed a simple, fast, and low cost method for bacterial detection based on hydroxyapatite nanoparticles with a nutritive mixture and the fluorogenic substrate. calcium phosphate ceramic nanoparticles were characterized and integrated with a nutritive mixture for the  early detection of bacteria by visual as well as fluorescence spectroscopy techniques. the composite was obtained by combining calcium phosphate nanoparticles (ca:p ratio, 1.33:1) with a nutritive mixture of protein hydrolysates and carbon sources, which promote fast bacterial multiplication, and the fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbellipheryl-beta-d-glucuronide (mug). the composite had an average particle size of 173.2 nm and did not show antibacterial activity against gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria. after an escherichia coli suspension was in contact with the composite for 60-90 min, fluorescence detected under uv light or by fluorescence spectrophotometer indicated the presence of bacteria. intense fluorescence was observed after incubation for a maximum of 90 min. thus, this calcium phosphate nanocomposite system may be useful as a model for the development of other nanoparticle composites for detection of early bacterial adhesion.

AB  == background: the phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (ast) of bacteria depends on minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints issued by national and international breakpoint committees. the current study was performed in order to  test the influence of different ast standards on local cumulative ast data and on antibiotic consumption. methods: automated ast was performed with clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, and e. faecium. from each species 100 prospectively collected non-duplicate clinical isolates were tested and mic data were interpreted according to the interpretation standards issued by din and eucast, respectively. in addition cumulative ast data from clinical isolates and antibiotic consumption were monitored before and after implementation of new eucast mic breakpoints. results: the susceptibility rate of p. aeruginosa against piperacillin and gentamicin, and of c. freundii against piperacillin/tazobactam increased significantly, whereas the susceptibility rates of e. cloacae, s. marcescens, and m. morganii against ciprofloxacin decreased significantly after switching from din to eucast mic breakpoints. these changes in the cumulative antibiotic resistance pattern were reflected by enhanced consumption of piperacillin/tazobactam after implementation of eucast mic breakpoints. conclusions: these data show that changes of ast breakpoints have a significant influence on local cumulative ast data and on antibiotic consumption.

TI  == antibacterial validation of electrogenerated hypochlorite using carbon-based electrodes.
AB  == this proof-of-concept study explores the novel use of carbon-based electrodes for the electrochemical generation of hypochlorite and compares the antimicrobial efficacy against commercial hypochlorite solution. antimicrobial concentrations of hypochlorite were generated using pad-printed carbon and carbon fibre electrodes, yielding up to 0.027% hypochlorite in 60 min and 0.1% hypochlorite in 15 min, respectively, in a nondivided assembly. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the electrogenerated hypochlorite produced using carbon fibre electrodes was established for four medically important bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus approx. 0.025%, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis approx. 0.012%) and found to be in agreement with  those determined using commercial hypochlorite solution. therefore, carbon-based  electrodes, particularly carbon fibre, have proven effective for the generation of antimicrobial concentrations of hypochlorite. the similarity of the mic values to commercial hypochlorite solutions suggests that the antimicrobial efficacy is  derived from the quantified hypochlorite generated and not due to marked cogeneration of reactive oxygen species, as identified for other assemblies. as such, the application of carbon electrodes may be suitable for the local production of hypochlorite for healthcare antisepsis. significance and impact of  the study: carbon fibre electrodes can rapidly generate antimicrobial concentrations of hypochlorite; as such, these cheap and commercially available electrodes are proposed for the local production of hypochlorite for healthcare antisepsis. importantly, the antimicrobial properties of the electrochemically generated hypochlorite mirror those of commercial hypochlorite, suggesting this is not enhanced by the cogeneration of reactive oxygen species. this illustrates  the potential use of disposable carbon electrodes for localized small-volume production of hypochlorite for surface and skin cleansing, and opens a broader scope of research into the exploitation of carbon electrodes for this application.

TI  == which tree orders in southern africa have the highest antimicrobial activity and  selectivity against bacterial and fungal pathogens of animals?
AB  == background: the study randomly screened leaf extracts of several hundred southern african tree species against important microbial pathogens to determine which taxa have the highest activity and may yield useful products to treat infections  in the animal health market. methods: we determined the antibacterial and antifungal activity of 714 acetone leaf extracts of 537 different tree species against enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and cryptococcus neoformans. a sensitive serial dilution microplate method was used. results: several extracts had mics as low as 0.02 mg/ml. we analysed 14 out of the 38 tree orders where we determined the activity of more than 8 different tree species representing 89% of all species examined. there were statistically significant differences in some cases. celastrales, rosales and myrtales had the highest activity against gram-positive  bacteria, the myrtales and fabales against the gram-negative bacteria and the malvales and proteales against the fungi. species present in the asterales followed by the gentiales and lamiales had the lowest activities against all the  microorganisms tested. fabales species had the highest activities against all the microorganisms tested. there was substantial selectivity in some orders. proteales species had very high activity against the fungi but very low activity  against the bacteria. the species in the celastrales and rosales had very low antifungal activity, low activity against gram-negative bacteria and very high activity against gram-positive bacteria. conclusion: against all classes of microorganisms, the four orders containing species with the highest average antimicrobial activities also contained several species with low activities against different pathogens and vice versa. these results therefore should be used with circumspection in selecting tree orders that would yield the highest probability of finding species with promising activities. nevertheless there was  a twofold increase in probability of finding extracts with interesting antifungal activity from orders with high mean activity than from orders with low mean activity. the probability increased to threefold and fivefold for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria respectively.

TI  == bacteriology of pressure ulcers in individuals with spinal cord injury: what we know and what we should know.
AB  == individuals with spinal cord injury (sci) are at increased risk for the development of pressure ulcers. these chronic wounds are debilitating and contribute to prolonged hospitalization and worse medical outcome. however, the species of bacteria and the role that specific species may play in delaying the healing of chronic pressure ulcers in the sci population has not been well characterized. this study will review the literature regarding what is known currently about the bacteriology of pressure ulcers in individuals with sci. an electronic literature search of medline (1966 to february 2014) was performed. eleven studies detailing bacterial cultures of pressure ulcers in the sci population met inclusion criteria and were selected for review. among these studies, bacterial cultures were often polymicrobial with both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria identified with culture techniques that varied significantly.  the most common organisms identified in pressure ulcers were staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococcus faecalis. in  general, wounds were poorly characterized with minimal to no physical description and/or location provided. our present understanding of factors that may alter the microbiome of pressure ulcers in individuals with sci is quite rudimentary, at best. well-designed studies are needed to assess appropriate wound culture technique, the impact of bacterial composition on wound healing, development of infection, and the optimum medical and surgical approaches to wound care.

TI  == a simple and effective method to synthesize fluorescent nanoparticles using tryptophan and light and their lethal effect against bacteria.
AB  == a simple, environmentally friendly and cost-effective method was used to synthesize silver nanoparticles using tryptophan and light. to prepare the nanoparticles, the following components were used: deionized water, silver nitrate, light and tryptophan. the effects of the tryptophan concentration and light exposure time on the formation of tryptophan silver nanoparticles (tnnps) were studied. the synthesized tnnps were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (tem), absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and zeta potential measurements. the synthesized tnnps were nearly spherical, with sizes of approximately 17 nm. in addition, the antibacterial activity of tnnps was determined by monitoring the growth curves of strains of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, and enterococcus faecalis using the microdilution test. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for 4 of 5 tested bacteria was determined to be between 20.0  and 17.5 mug/ml for 48 h and between 22.5 and 20.0 mug/ml for 72 h.

TI  == whole-animal chemical screen identifies colistin as a new immunomodulator that targets conserved pathways.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to take advantage of the nematode caenorhabditis elegans to perform a whole-animal chemical screen to identify potential immune activators that may confer protection against bacterial infections. we identified 45 marketed drugs, out of 1,120 studied compounds, that are capable of activating a conserved p38/pmk-1 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway required for innate immunity. one of these drugs, the last-resort antibiotic colistin, protected against infections by the gram-negative pathogens yersinia pestis and pseudomonas aeruginosa but not by the gram-positive pathogens enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus. protection was independent of the antibacterial activity of colistin, since the drug was administered prophylactically prior to the infections and it was also effective against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. immune activation by colistin is mediated not only by the p38/pmk-1 pathway but also by the conserved foxo transcription factor daf-16 and the transcription factor skn-1. furthermore, p38/pmk-1 was found to be required in the intestine for immune activation by colistin. enhanced p38/pmk-1-mediated immune responses by colistin did not reduce the bacterial burden, indicating that the pathway plays a role in the development of host tolerance to infections by gram-negative bacteria. importance: the innate immune  system represents the front line of our defenses against invading microorganisms. given the ever-increasing resistance to antibiotics developed by bacterial pathogens, the possibility of boosting immune defenses represents an interesting, complementary approach to conventional antibiotic treatments. here we report that the antibiotic colistin can protect against infections by a mechanism that is independent of its microbicidal activity. prophylactic treatment with colistin activates a conserved p38/pmk-1 pathway in the intestine that helps the host better tolerate a bacterial infection. since p38/pmk-1-mediated immune responses  appear to be conserved from plants to mammals, colistin may also activate immunity in higher organisms, including humans. antibiotics with immunomodulatory properties have the potential of improving the long-term outcome of patients with chronic infectious diseases.

TI  == bacteriophages as an alternative strategy for fighting biofilm development.
AB  == the ability of microbes to form biofilms is an important element of their pathogenicity, and biofilm formation is a serious challenge for today's medicine. fighting the clinical complications associated with biofilm formation is very difficult and linked to a high risk of failure, especially in a time of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. bacterial species most commonly isolated from biofilms include coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. the frequent failure of antibiotic therapy led researchers to look for alternative methods and experiment with the use of antibacterial factors with a mechanism of action different from that of antibiotics. experimental studies with bacteriophages and mixtures thereof, expressing lytic properties against numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species showed that bacteriophages may both prevent biofilm formation and contribute to eradication of biofilm bacteria. a specific role is played here by phage depolymerases, which facilitate the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (eps) and thus the permeation of bacteriophages into deeper biofilm layers and lysis of the susceptible bacterial  cells. much hope is placed in genetic modifications of bacteriophages that would  allow the equipping bacteriophages with the function of depolymerase synthesis. the use of phage cocktails prevents the development of phage-resistant bacteria.

TI  == development of a multiplex real-time pcr assay for the rapid diagnosis of neonatal late onset sepsis.
AB  == the diagnosis of late onset sepsis (los), a severe condition with high prevalence in preterm infants, is hampered by the suboptimal sensitivity and long turnaround time of blood culture. detection of the infecting pathogen directly in blood by pcr would provide a much more timely result. unfortunately, pcr-based assays reported so far are labor intensive and often lack direct species identification. therefore we developed a real-time multiplex pcr assay tailored to los diagnosis  which is easy-to-use, is applicable on small blood volumes and provides species-specific results within 4h. species-specific pcr assays were selected from literature or developed using bioinformatic tools for the detection of the most prevalent etiologic pathogens: enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus spp., streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella spp. and serratia marcescens. the pcr assays showed 100% specificity, full coverage of the target pathogens and a limit of detection (lod) of </=10cfueq./reaction. these lod values were maintained in the multiplex format or when bacterial dna was isolated from blood. clinical evaluation showed high concordance between the multiplex pcr and blood culture. in conclusion, we developed a multiplex pcr that allows the direct detection of the most important  bacterial pathogens causing los in preterm infants.

TI  == beyond paraquats: dialkyl 3,3'- and 3,4'-bipyridinium amphiphiles as antibacterial agents.
AB  == dialkyl 4,4'-bipyridinium compounds, known as 'paraquats' (pqs), have a long history of use as herbicides, as redox indicators, and more recently as potent antibacterial agents. however, due to their ability to form reactive oxygen species (ros) in vivo, pqs are also known to be toxic. we proposed that altering  the electrochemical properties of pq, specifically by preparing isomeric bipyridinium structures with 3,3'- and 3,4'-substitution of the nitrogen heteroatoms on the biaryl core, would maintain antibacterial activity, yet decrease toxicity. we have thus prepared a series of 17 amphiphiles, dubbed 'metaquat' (mq) and 'parametaquat' (pmq), respectively, and investigated their antibacterial and electrochemical properties. optimal inhibition of bacterial growth was observed in symmetric, biscationic structures; minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values measured as low as 0.5 mum against both gram-positive  and gram-negative bacteria for the compound pmq-11,11. electrochemical analysis demonstrated the redox properties of the dialkyl 3,3'- and 3,4'-bipyridinium amphiphiles to be distinct from those of the 4,4'-bipyridinium isomer. thus mq and pmq amphiphiles maintain the strong antibacterial activity of the pq isomers, but show promise for reduced ros toxicity.

TI  == improved antibacterial behavior of titanium surface with torularhodin-polypyrrole film.
AB  == the problem of microorganisms attaching and proliferating on implants and medical devices surfaces is still attracting interest in developing research on different coatings based on antibacterial agents. the aim of this work is centered on modifying titanium (ti) based implants surfaces through incorporation of a natural compound with antimicrobial effect, torularhodin (t), by means of a polypyrrole (ppy) film. this study tested the potential antimicrobial activity of the new coating against a range of standard bacterial strains: escherichia coli,  staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the morphology, physical and electrochemical properties of the synthesized films were assessed by sem, afm, uv-vis, ftir and cyclic voltammetry. in addition, biocompatibility of this new coating was evaluated using l929 mouse  fibroblast cells. the results showed that ppy-torularhodin composite film acts as a corrosion protective coating with antibacterial activity and it has no harmful  effect on cell viability.

TI  == antibacterial efficiency of vermiculite/chlorhexidine nanocomposites and results  of the in vivo test of harmlessness of vermiculite.
AB  == clay minerals have been proposed as very useful materials for modulating drug delivery. these are the commonly used materials in pharmaceutical production both as inorganic carriers or active agents. we focused on the development of suitable long-acting material for local treatment of oral infection where clay minerals act as inorganic drug carriers. organovermiculites with antibacterial activity were prepared by ion exchange reactions using different concentrations of chlorhexidine diacetate. the samples were characterized by x-ray diffraction (xrd), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir) and thermal analysis (tga). the antibacterial activity was evaluated by finding the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic). all studied organoclays possessed good antibacterial activity after 24h exposure against escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis and particularly against staphylococcus aureus. pseudomonas aeruginosa however proved very resistant as only the sample with the highest concentration of ca that successfully inhibited bacterial growth. furthermore, clay mineral vermiculite was subjected to in vivo toxicological analysis and its influence on gastrointestinal tract during its oral application was investigated. tissue samples from buccal mucosa, tongue, esophagus, stomach, terminal duodenum, small  intestine, caecum, distal colon and liver were subjected to histological examination, both macroscopically and microscopically. neither systemic nor local reactions were observed. therefore the toxicity of vermiculite to a mammal model  organism can be excluded.

TI  == screening and characterisation of antimicrobial properties of semisynthetic betulin derivatives.
AB  == betulin (lup-20(29)-ene-3beta, 28-diol) is a naturally occurring triterpene, which is found in substantial amounts from the outer bark of birch trees. a library of 51 structurally diverse semisynthetic betulin derivatives was screened against five bacterial strains, enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and a fungal strain candida albicans, using broth microdilution assays. primary antimicrobial  screening at 50 microm concentration led to the identification of five compounds  showing antimicrobial properties (inhibition of growth by >70% against one or more microbial strains). according to the dose-response results, 28-o-(n-acetylanthraniloyl)betulin (compound 5) was the most active, showing mic90 of 6.25 microm against two gram-positive bacteria, e. faecalis and s. aureus. however, the activity of this compound was affected by albumin binding, which was demonstrated by the loss of activity in a host-pathogen co-culture assay as well as in the antibacterial assay in the presence of increased concentration of albumin. furthermore, the effects on mammalian cells were evaluated by cytotoxicity assessment on hepatocyte cell culture after 24 h exposure to the compounds. betulinic aldehyde (18), betulin-28-oxime (31) and hetero cycloadduct with acetoxy groups at carbon atoms 3 and 28 and ethyl substituent at the triazolo ring (43) displayed cytotoxicity towards hepatocytes, with ic50 values of 47, 25 and 16 microm, respectively. the ic50 value for 28-o-(n-acetylanthraniloyl)betulin (5) was 56 microm. the current study presents  an insight into using betulin scaffold for developing derivatives with antibacterial potential, and furthermore the necessity of in-depth analysis of found actives through selectivity profiling and follow-up studies including in silico admet predictions.

AB  == objectives: to present a case of endodontic failure obturated with a methacrylate-based root filling material, resilon/realseal (rs). to determine if  rs is susceptible to biodegradation by endodontically relevant microbes by a method known to show rs degradation. method and materials: emulsions of rs were dispersed in agar with minimal bacterial nutrients in culture plates. lipase ps served as a positive control. pseudomonas aeruginosa, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis were tested for their ability to biodegrade rs. the bacteria were inoculated in the plates and examined daily for rs degradation for 7 days. results: degradation of the emulsified rs manifested in the formation of clear zones around p aeruginosa, p intermedia, p asaccharolytica, s aureus, and s epidermidis. no degradation was seen with the other tested bacteria or in plates that did not contain rs emulsion. conclusion:  endodontic pathogenic bacteria can degrade rs. these findings complement other work and suggest that the seal and integrity of root canal fillings obturated with rs may be impaired by a microbial insult.

TI  == toll-like receptor 8 agonist and bacteria trigger potent activation of innate immune cells in human liver.
AB  == the ability of innate immune cells to sense and respond to impending danger varies by anatomical location. the liver is considered tolerogenic but is still capable of mounting a successful immune response to clear various infections. to  understand whether hepatic immune cells tune their response to different infectious challenges, we probed mononuclear cells purified from human healthy and diseased livers with distinct pathogen-associated molecules. we discovered that only the tlr8 agonist ssrna40 selectively activated liver-resident innate immune cells to produce substantial quantities of ifn-gamma. we identified cd161(bright) mucosal-associated invariant t (mait) and cd56(bright) nk cells as  the responding liver-resident innate immune cells. their activation was not directly induced by the tlr8 agonist but was dependent on il-12 and il-18 production by ssrna40-activated intrahepatic monocytes. importantly, the ssrna40-induced cytokine-dependent activation of mait cells mirrored responses induced by bacteria, i.e., generating a selective production of high levels of ifn-gamma, without the concomitant production of tnf-alpha or il-17a. the intrahepatic ifn-gamma production could be detected not only in healthy livers, but also in hbv- or hcv-infected livers. in conclusion, the human liver harbors a network of immune cells able to modulate their immunological responses to different pathogen-associated molecules. their ability to generate a strong production of ifn-gamma upon stimulation with tlr8 agonist opens new therapeutic  opportunities for the treatment of diverse liver pathologies.

TI  == use of a dissolved oxygen microsensor for assessing the viability and thickness of microbial biofilm on root surfaces.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the use of a dissolved oxygen microsensor (doms) for assessing the viability and thickness of microbial biofilms on the apical external surface  of contaminated human tooth roots. methodology: apical biofilm formation was evaluated in 15 roots contaminated in vitro with a polymicrobial mixture of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida  albicans for 7, 21 and 60 days and in three freshly extracted roots with associated radiographically visible periapical lesions. in each root, the thickness and viability (measured by the amount of dissolved oxygen) of biofilm formed on the apical 2 mm were examined with the doms. scanning electron microscopy (sem) was used as an auxiliary analysis to confirm the existence of the biofilms detected by the doms. results: the doms detected dissolved oxygen on the biofilms formed on the three residual roots up to thickness of 375 mum, 480 mum and 1650 mum. in the 15 roots contaminated in vitro, the doms detected dissolved oxygen in six specimens up to thicknesses from 75 to 250 mum, and the intensity of the metabolic activity (biofilm thickness) was directly proportional to the contamination time. sem confirmed the presence of biofilm in all roots. conclusion: the dissolved oxygen microsensor allowed the measurement of the amount of dissolved oxygen in the biofilm, which is indicative of the intensity of the microbial metabolic activity (viability), correlating the results with biofilm thickness. the doms was effective in freshly extracted roots, but had limitations in roots contaminated in vitro after short periods (7 and 21 days) of contamination.

TI  == influence of acetylation degree and molecular weight of homogeneous chitosans on  antibacterial and antifungal activities.
AB  == the results given in the literature are conflicting when considering the relationship between antimicrobial activity and chitosan characteristics. to be able to clarify, we prepared fifteen homogeneous chitosans with different acetylation degrees (da) and molecular weights (mw) by reacetylation of a fully deacetylated chitin under homogeneous conditions. they were tested at different ph values for their antimicrobial activities against four gram-negative bacteria  (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella typhi), four gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis and micrococcus luteus) and three fungi (aspergillus niger, fusarium oxysporum and alternaria solani). chitosans markedly inhibited growth of most bacteria and fungi tested, although the inhibitory effect depends on the type of microorganism and on the chitosan characteristics (da and mw) with minimum inhibitory concentrations in the range of 0.001 to 0.1 w%. considering chitosan efficiency on bacteria, our series of data clearly show that the lower da and the lower ph give the larger efficiency. antibacterial activity was further enhanced for gram-negative bacteria with decreasing mw, whereas, opposite effect was observed with the gram-positive. concerning the antifungal activity, the influence of chitosan characteristics was dependent on the particular type of fungus. fungal growth decreased with increasing mw for f. oxysporum and decreasing da for a. solani, but no mw or da dependences were observed with a. niger.

TI  == innate host defense requires tfeb-mediated transcription of cytoprotective and antimicrobial genes.
AB  == animal host defense against infection requires the expression of defense genes at the right place and the right time. understanding such tight control of host defense requires the elucidation of the transcription factors involved. by using  an unbiased approach in the model caenorhabditis elegans, we discovered that hlh-30 (known as tfeb in mammals) is a key transcription factor for host defense. hlh-30 was activated shortly after staphylococcus aureus infection, and drove the expression of close to 80% of the host response, including antimicrobial and autophagy genes that were essential for host tolerance of infection. tfeb was also rapidly activated in murine macrophages upon s. aureus infection and was required for proper transcriptional induction of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. thus, our data suggest that tfeb is a previously unappreciated, evolutionarily ancient transcription factor in the host response to infection.

TI  == multispecies biofilm in an artificial wound bed--a novel model for in vitro assessment of solid antimicrobial dressings.
AB  == wound infections represent a major problem, particularly in patients with chronic wounds. bacteria in the wound exist mainly in the form of biofilms and are thus resistant to most antibiotics and antimicrobials. a simple and cost-effective in  vitro model of chronic wound biofilms applied for testing treatments and solid devices, especially wound dressings, is presented in this work. the method is based on the well-established lubbock chronic wound biofilm transferred onto an artificial agar wound bed. the biofilm formed by four bacterial species (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas  aeruginosa) was stable for up to 48h post-transplant. the applicability of the model was evaluated by testing two common iodine wound treatments. these observations indicate that this method enables assessing the effects of treatments on established resilient wound biofilms and is clinically highly relevant.

AB  == rhenium complexes with the antibiotic ciprofloxacin have been prepared to be studied as models of technetium radiopharmaceuticals. with this aim, the new rhenium complexes 1 {[reo(cpf)2]cl}, 2 {[reo(cpfh)2]cl3} and 3 {fac-[re(co)3(h2o)(cpf)]} with ciprofloxacin (cpfh=ciprofloxacin; cpf=conjugated  base of ciprofloxacin) have been synthesised and characterised by elemental analyses, ir, nmr ((1)h, (19)f and (13)c cp-mas) spectroscopy, as well as ms measurements. all spectroscopic data are consistent with the coordination of ciprofloxacin in all these complexes through the carbonyl and the carboxylate oxygen atoms with the formation of a six member chelate ring. the study of a tc-ciprofloxacin solution by esi-ms reveals the presence of [tco(cpf)2](+) cations, which agrees with the hypothesis that complexes 1 and 2 can be seen as model rhenium complexes of this radiopharmaceutical. antimicrobial and dna gyrase inhibition studies performed with complexes 2 and 3 have shown a very similar behaviour between complex 2 and the free antibiotic, whereas complex 3 exhibit a  lower antimicrobial activity. based on a joint analysis of the data reported in the literature and the chemical and biological results obtained in this study, a  tentative proposal to explain some aspects of the behaviour of tc-ciprofloxacin radiopharmaceutical has been made.

TI  == antibacterial activity of tham trisphenylguanide against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == this study investigated the potential antibacterial activity of three series of compounds synthesized from 12 linear and branched polyamines with 2-8 amino groups, which were substituted to produce the corresponding guanides, biguanides, or phenylguanides, against acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. antibacterial activity was measured for each compound by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration against the bacteria, and the toxicity towards mammalian cells was  determined. the most effective compound, tham trisphenylguanide, was studied in time-to-kill and cytoplasmic leakage assays against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, usa300) in comparison to chlorhexidine. preliminary  toxicity and mrsa challenge studies in mice were also conducted on this compound. tham trisphenylguanide showed significant antibacterial activity (mic approximately 1 mg/l) and selectivity against mrsa relative to all the other bacteria examined. in time-to-kill assays it showed increased antimicrobial activity against mrsa versus chlorhexidine. it induced leakage of cytoplasmic content at concentrations that did not reduce cell viability, suggesting the mechanism of action may involve membrane disruption. using an intraperitoneal mouse model of invasive mrsa disease, tham trisphenylguanide reduced bacterial burden locally and in deeper tissues. this study has identified a novel guanide compound with selective microbicidal activity against staphylococcus aureus, including a methicillin-resistant (mrsa) strain.

TI  == synthesis, characterization, antimicrobial activity and carbonic anhydrase enzyme inhibitor effects of salicilaldehyde-n-methyl p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone and its  palladium(ii), cobalt(ii) complexes.
AB  == we report the synthesis of the ligand, salicilaldehyde-n-methyl p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone (salptsmh) derived from p-toluenesulfonicacid-1-methylhydrazide (ptsmh) and its pd(ii) and co(ii) metal complexes were synthesized for the first time. the structure of the ligand and their complexes were investigated using elemental analysis, magnetic susceptibility, molar conductance and spectral (ir, nmr and lc-ms) measurements.  salptsmh has also been characterized by single crystal x-ray diffraction. (1)h and (13)c shielding tensors for crystal structure were calculated with giao/dft/b3lyp/6-311++g(d,p) methods in cdcl3. the complexes were found to have general composition [ml2]. the results of elemental analysis showed 1:2 (metal/ligand) stoichiometry for all the complex. magnetic and spectral data indicate a square planar geometry for pd(ii) complex and a distorted tetrahedral  geometry for co(ii) complexes. the ligand and its metal chelates have been screened for their antimicrobial activities using the disk diffusion method against the selected gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus,  staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, gram negative bacteria: eschericha  coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia. the inhibition activities of  these compounds on carbonic anhydrase ii (ca ii) and carbonic anhydrase i (ca i)  have been investigated by comparing ic50 and ki values and it has been found that pd(ii) complex have more enzyme inhibition efficiency than salptsmh and co(ii) complex.

TI  == isolation and biological activity of compounds from garcinia preussii.
AB  == context: plants of the genus garcinia (clusiaceae) are traditionally used to relieve stomachaches, toothaches, and as a chew stick. objective: in order to determine which compounds were responsible for these activities, a phytochemical  investigation of the fruits and leaves of garcinia preussii engl. was pursued. materials and methods: plants were extracted by solvents of various polarities. compounds isolation was then carried out using chromatography methods (medium- and high-pressure liquid chromatography, open column and thin-layer chromatography). the isolated compounds were identified and characterized by using 1d and 2d nmr spectroscopies. the antioxidant activity was evaluated using  dpph(*), abts(*-), alp, and orac assays. the antimicrobial activity was assayed against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) value. the cytotoxic activity of most of the isolated compounds was evaluated on  a small panel of human cancer cell lines (du145, hela, ht-29, and a431) using the xtt method. results: the phytochemical investigation of g. preussii led to the isolation of eight known compounds, six benzophenones and two flavonoids. these compounds were tested for their biological activities. 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 8 demonstrated a high free radical scavenging activity with er50 ranging from 0.1 to 0.7. the antimicrobial activity was shown only against gram-positive bacteria  for 1, 4, and 5. a moderate cytotoxic activity with ic50 ranging from 7 to 50 microm was observed, except for 6 which was not active. conclusion: these results appear to support some of the properties reported for garcinia species.

TI  == paenibacterin, a novel broad-spectrum lipopeptide antibiotic, neutralises endotoxins and promotes survival in a murine model of pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced sepsis.
AB  == paenibacterin, produced by paenibacillus thiaminolyticus osy-se, is active both against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, including antibiotic-resistant strains of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. paenibacterin showed relatively low cytotoxicity against a human kidney cell line (atcc crl-2190), with a 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50)>/=109mug/ml. the cationic paenibacterin molecule binds to the negatively charged gram-negative endotoxins in vitro, suggesting that paenibacterin can neutralise lipopolysaccharides. in a murine septic shock model, two 500mug doses of paenibacterin significantly increased the survival of mice challenged with a lethal level of p. aeruginosa. considering that paenibacterin is effective against many strains of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, this study suggests that  this antimicrobial agent is a promising candidate as a new drug.

TI  == colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip test compromising optimised combinations of anti-s. suis capsular polysaccharide polyclonal antibodies for detection of streptococcus suis.
AB  == a rapid diagnosis kit that detects streptococcus suis (s. suis) antigens from urine with an immunochromatographic stripe (ics) test was developed in this study. the ics test was produced using colloidal gold coated with polyclonal antibodies (pabs) against s. suis. the pabs were developed from rabbits immunised with s. suis serotype 2 capsular polysaccharides (cps). development of the pabs was investigated to establish their binding to cps and to determine the maximum sensitivity of two combination antibodies for the ics test. the results of the ics optimisation revealed that the combinations of pab c-n1 and pab c-n2 had the  highest sensitivity to cps. the minimum limitation of ics sensitivity indicated 1.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (cfu) and a cps concentration of 0.05 microg. the assay time for detection of s. suis antigens is less than 15 min, which is suitable for rapid detection. a cross-reactive test was also conducted, and it detected no other bacteria (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae). the cross-reactivity of other serotypes in s. suis was also investigated, and tests for serotypes of 1, 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6,  7, 8, 9, 14, and 16 were positive. this study presents the first report of a development of an ics that enables the quantitative detection of streptococcal antigens. the s. suis ics provides several advantages over other methods, including the speed and simplicity of use.

TI  == antibacterial activity of kaolinite/nanotio2 composites in relation to irradiation time.
AB  == the paper addresses laboratory preparation and antibacterial activity testing of  kaolinite/nanotio2 composite in respect of the daylight irradiation time. kaolinite/nanotio2 composites with 20 and 40 wt% of tio2 were laboratory prepared, dried at 105 degrees c and calcined at 600 degrees c. the calcination caused transformation of kaolinite to metakaolinite and origination of the metakaolinite/nanotio2 composite. x-ray powder diffraction, raman and ftir spectroscopic methods revealed titanium dioxide only in the form of anatase in all evaluated samples (non-calcined and calcined) and also transformation of kaolinite to metakaolinite after the calcination treatment. scanning electron microscopy was used as a method for characterization of morphology and elemental  composition of the studied samples. a standard microdilution test was used to determine the antibacterial activity using four human pathogenic bacterial strains (staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa). a lamp with a wide spectrum bulb simulating daylight was used for induction of photocatalysis. the antibacterial assays found all the kati samples to have antibacterial potency with different onset of the activity when calcined samples exhibited antibacterial activity earlier than the non-calcined.  significant difference in antibacterial activity of kati samples for different bacterial strains was not observed.

TI  == ceftobiprole activity against over 60,000 clinical bacterial pathogens isolated in europe, turkey, and israel from 2005 to 2010.
AB  == ceftobiprole medocaril is a newly approved drug in europe for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap) (excluding patients with ventilator-associated  pneumonia but including ventilated hap patients) and community-acquired pneumonia in adults. the aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of ceftobiprole against prevalent gram-positive and -negative pathogens  isolated in europe, turkey, and israel during 2005 through 2010. a total of 60,084 consecutive, nonduplicate isolates from a wide variety of infections were  collected from 33 medical centers. species identification was confirmed, and all  isolates were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods.  ceftobiprole had high activity against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (100.0% susceptible), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and streptococcus pneumoniae (99.3% susceptible), with mic90 values of 0.25, 0.12, </= 0.06, and 0.5 mug/ml, respectively. ceftobiprole was active against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) (98.3% susceptible) and methicillin-resistant cons, having a mic90 of 2 mug/ml. ceftobiprole was active against enterococcus faecalis (mic50/90, 0.5/4 mug/ml) but not against most enterococcus faecium isolates. ceftobiprole was very potent against the majority of enterobacteriaceae (87.3% susceptible), with >80%  inhibited at </= 0.12 mug/ml. the potency of ceftobiprole against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic50/90, 2/>8 mug/ml; 64.6% at mic values of </= 4 mug/ml) was similar to that of ceftazidime (mic50/90, 2/>16 mug/ml; 75.4% susceptible), but limited activity was observed against acinetobacter spp. and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. high activity was also observed against all haemophilus influenzae (mic90, </= 0.06 mug/ml) and moraxella catarrhalis (mic50/90, </= 0.06/0.25 mug/ml) isolates. ceftobiprole demonstrated a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity against this very large longitudinal sample of contemporary pathogens.

TI  == amikacin-fosfomycin at a five-to-two ratio: characterization of mutation rates in microbial strains causing ventilator-associated pneumonia and interactions with commonly used antibiotics.
AB  == the amikacin-fosfomycin inhalation system (afis), a combination of antibiotics administered with an in-line nebulizer delivery system, is being developed for adjunctive treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap). the in vitro characterization of amikacin-fosfomycin (at a 5:2 ratio) described here included  determining resistance selection rates for pathogens that are representative of those commonly associated with vap (including multidrug-resistant strains) and evaluating interactions with antibiotics commonly used intravenously to treat vap. spontaneous resistance to amikacin-fosfomycin (5:2) was not observed for most strains tested (n, 10/14). four strains had spontaneously resistant colonies (frequencies, 4.25 x 10(-8) to 3.47 x 10(-10)), for which amikacin-fosfomycin (5:2) mics were 2- to 8-fold higher than those for the original strains. after 7  days of serial passage, resistance (>4-fold increase over the baseline mic) occurred in fewer strains (n, 4/14) passaged in the presence of amikacin-fosfomycin (5:2) than with either amikacin (n, 7/14) or fosfomycin (n, 12/14) alone. interactions between amikacin-fosfomycin (5:2) and 10 comparator antibiotics in checkerboard testing against 30 different gram-positive or gram-negative bacterial strains were synergistic (fractional inhibitory concentration [fic] index, </= 0.5) for 6.7% (n, 10/150) of combinations tested.  no antagonism was observed. synergy was confirmed by time-kill methodology for amikacin-fosfomycin (5:2) plus cefepime (against escherichia coli), aztreonam (against pseudomonas aeruginosa), daptomycin (against enterococcus faecalis), and azithromycin (against staphylococcus aureus). amikacin-fosfomycin (5:2) was bactericidal at 4-fold the mic for 7 strains tested. the reduced incidence of development of resistance to amikacin-fosfomycin (5:2) compared with that for amikacin or fosfomycin alone, and the lack of negative interactions with commonly used intravenous antibiotics, further supports the development of afis for the treatment of vap.

TI  == toxicity of magnetic chitosan micro and nanoparticles as carriers for biologically active substances.
AB  == nanoparticles of inorganic magnetic core surrounded by layers of functional coatings are potential representatives of nanostructures for immobilization of bio-substances. magnetic nanoparticles (mnps) are often bound in aggregates due to a strong magnetic dipole, which has a lot of advantages, such as large surface area for binding biologically active substances. chitosan is a polysaccharide polymer that is non-toxic, hydrophilic, biocompatible and has hydroxy and amino groups in its structure. because of these chemical and biological properties it is a desirable bio-product for immobilization of enzymes and for binding of other biologically active substances. magnetic micro and nanoparticles were synthesized with chitosan by three different methods; microemulsion process, suspension cross-linking technique and covalent binding of chitosan. toxic effect of the prepared magnetic particles was determined as well and was examined on five different bacterial cultures; escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and klebsiella pneumoniae. at concentrations of 10-30 mg of magnetic particles per 0.5 mcfarland standard solution of e. coli and per 400 cfu of s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, e. faecalis in k. pneumonia, no inhibition on the chosen bacterial cultures was detected.

TI  == aureobasidium pullulans as a source of liamocins (heavy oils) with anticancer activity.
AB  == liamocins are structurally unique, heavier-than-water "oils" produced by certain  strains of aureobasidium pullulans. the aim of the current study is to identify new sources of liamocins and evaluate their potential as anticancer agents. nine  strains of a. pullulans from phylogenetic clades 8, 9, and 11 were examined for the first time for production of liamocins. strains in these clades have only been isolated from tropical environments, and all strains tested here were from various locations in thailand. strains rsu 9, rsu 21, and rsu 29, all from clade  11, produced from 7.0 to 8.6 g liamocins/l from medium containing 5 % sucrose. these are the highest yields of liamocins that we have found thus far. these strains also produced from 9.4 to 17 g pullulan/l. the structural identity of liamocins was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry; differential spectra were obtained in which the dominant ion was either at about m/z 805.5 or m/z 949.6, consistent with the structure of liamocins. liamocins from a. pullulans strains rsu 9 and rsu 21 inhibited two human breast cancer cell lines and a human cervical cancer cell line (ic50 values of 32.2 +/- 1.4 to 63.1 +/- 2.4 mug liamocins/ml) but were not toxic to a normal  cell line. liamocins weakly inhibited a strain of enterococcus faecalis, but did  not inhibit strains of lactobacillus fermentum, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. thus, a. pullulans phylogenetic clade 11 is a promising source of liamocins, and these compounds merit further examination as potential anticancer agents.

AB  == purpose: considering the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of green tea, this study aimed to evaluate the antibacterial effect of mouthrinses containing green tea extract vs 0.2% chlorhexidine on selected microorganisms in vitro. materials and methods: the antibacterial activity of both mouthrinses and the pure green tea extract was assessed by using disk diffusion and the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) methods against five microorganisms: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aerogenosa and escherichia coli. growth inhibition zones were measured in mm after 24 h of incubation at 37 degrees c. the two mouthrinses were assessed at concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512 mg/ml to determine the mic, which was interpreted as the lowest concentration of the agent that completely inhibited the growth of the test species. results: 0.2% chlorhexidine produced a larger zone of growth inhibition than did the mouthrinse made of green tea extract (p < 0.01). paradoxically, the growth inhibition zones  of the tested bacteria were significantly larger in pure extract of green tea than in 0.2% chlorhexidine (p < 0.01). the chlorhexidine mouthrinse inhibited the growth of all tested species and exhibited significantly lower mics than did the  green tea mouthrinse (p < 0.01). conclusions: even though the mouthrinse made with green tea extract presented an in vitro antimicrobial activity inferior to 0.2% chlorhexidine, the pure extract had considerable bactericidal effect.

AB  == in recent years, the synergistic relationship between nadph oxidase (nox)/dual oxidase (duox) enzymes and peroxidases has received increased attention. peroxidases utilize nox/duox-generated h2o2 for a myriad of functions including,  but not limited to, thyroid hormone biosynthesis, cross-linking extracellular matrices (ecm), and immune defense. we postulated that one or more peroxidases produced by caenorhabditis elegans would act in host defense, possibly in conjunction with bli-3, the only nox/duox enzyme encoded by the genome that is expressed. animals exposed to rna interference (rnai) of the putative peroxidase  genes were screened for susceptibility to the human pathogen enterococcus faecalis. one of three genes identified, skpo-1 (shkt-containing peroxidase), was studied in depth. animals mutant for this gene were significantly more susceptible to e. faecalis, but not pseudomonas aeruginosa. a slight decrease in  longevity was also observed. the skpo-1 mutant animals had a dumpy phenotype of incomplete penetrance; half the animals displayed a dumpy phenotype ranging from  slight to severe, and half were morphologically wild type. the skpo-1 protein contains the critical catalytic residues necessary for peroxidase activity, and in a whole animal assay, more h2o2 was detected from the mutant compared to the wild type, consistent with the loss of an h2o2 sink. by using tissue-specific skpo-1 rnai and immunohistochemical localization with an anti-skpo-1 antibody, it was determined that the peroxidase is functionally and physically present in the  hypodermis. in conclusion, these results characterize a peroxidase that functions protectively in the hypodermis during exposure to e. faecalis.

TI  == vellozia flavicans mart. ex schult. hydroalcoholic extract inhibits the neuromuscular blockade induced by bothrops jararacussu venom.
AB  == background: snakebite is a significant public health issue in tropical countries. in brazil, some of the most common snake envenomations are from bothrops. bothrops bites trigger local and systemic effects including edema, pain, erythema, cyanosis, infections, and necrosis. vellozia flavicans is a plant from  the brazilian "cerrado" (savanna) that is popularly used as an anti-inflammatory  medicine. since inflammation develops quickly after bothrops bites, which can lead to infection, the aim of the present study was to observe possible anti-snake venom and antimicrobial activities of v. flavicans (vf). methods: the  chromatographic profile of the main constituents from the vf leaf hydroalcoholic  extract was obtained by thin-layer chromatography (tlc). the anti-snake venom activity was measured by vf's ability to neutralize the in vitro neuromuscular blockade caused by bothrops jararacussu venom (bjssu) in a mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm model (pnd). after a 20 min incubation, preparations of pnd were  added to tyrode's solution (control); vf (0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/ml); 40 mug/ml bjssu; pre-incubation for 30 min with bjssu and 1 mg/ml vf; and a bjssu pretreated preparation (for 10 min) followed by 1 mg/ml vf. myographic recording  was performed, and the contractile responses were recorded. the antimicrobial activity (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic] and minimum bactericidal concentration [mbc]) was obtained for staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecalis, using gentamicin and vancomycin as positive controls. results: tlc analysis yielded several compounds  from vf, such as flavonoids (quercetin) and phenolic acids (chlorogenic acid). bjssu completely blocked the contractile responses of pnd preparations, while vf  preserved 97% (+/-10%) of the contractile responses when incubated with bjssu. in the pnd pretreated with bjssu, vf was able to inhibit the neuromuscular blockade  progress. mic and mbc of vf ranged from 2.5 to 5.0 mg/ml for p. aeruginosa and s. aureus strains, while no antimicrobial activity was observed for e. coli and e. faecalis. conclusions: the hydroalcoholic extract from vf leaves was able to neutralize and decrease the in vitro neuromuscular blockade caused by bjssu. however, it did not show significant antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria.

TI  == [investigation of antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects of some preservatives used in drugs, cosmetics and food products].
AB  == preservatives are added to food, drugs and other pharmaceutical products to avoid microbial contamination. for antimicrobial activity testing and preservative efficacy testing, vegetative forms of the standard test organisms are used. however, microbial biofilm formation may occur on living tissues, medical implants, industrial or drinking water pipes, natural aquatic systems, glass and  plastic surfaces. in our study, it was aimed to determine the antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects of some preservatives used in drug, cosmetics and food products and to compare the minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (mbic) of microbial biofilm formed on glass surfaces which are commonly used in those areas and the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values of the planktonic forms. in the study pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, salmonella thyphimurium sl1344, staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, staphylococcus epidermidis nctc 11047, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212 and candida albicans atcc 10231 were used as the standard strains; sodium nitrate, methylparaben, prophylparaben, potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate as the preservatives; ampicillin, vancomycin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, amphotericin b and itraconazole as the antimicrobial agents. mic values were determined through the guidelines of clsi m100-s18 and m27-a3 protocols. biotimer method was used to determine the mbic values. the value of "colony forming unit (cfu)/glass beads" was calculated using the graphics drawn by plotting the time of color change for phenol red or resazurin against log10cfu. all experiments were done with four media at different ph values namely ph: 7, ph: 6.5, ph: 6 and ph: 5.5. according to the results of tests on planktonic forms of the microorganisms, sodium benzoate was determined to be the most effective preservative against all the microorganisms tested except s.aureus and e.faecalis. the most effective preservative against s.aureus  and e.faecalis was prophylparaben. prophylparaben was also effective against s.epidermidis. however, in our study it was determined that preservatives were not effective against biofilm forms even if the inoculum was lower, equal to or higher than the inocula of the planktonic forms. the data obtained from this study indicated that preservatives used to prevent microbial contamination in pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food products, are not effective against biofilm forms of the microorganisms. this study is thought to be a guide for further studies to be held in the investigation of antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects  of preservatives used in drugs, cosmetics and food industry.

TI  == acanthamoeba and bacteria produce antimicrobials to target their counterpart.
AB  == background: in the microbial ecosystem, microbes compete for space and nutrients. consequently, some have developed the ability to kill or inhibit the growth of other competing microbes by producing antimicrobial substances. as the 'producer' species are generally immune to these substances, their compounds act on the competing microbial species and give the producer more space and access to nutrients for growth. many currently used antibiotics were developed by exploiting this potential of certain microbes. findings: here, the free-living amoeba, acanthamoeba castellanii, was investigated for its antibacterial activity against representative gram positive and gram negative bacteria, while bacterial  isolates were tested for their anti-amoebic properties. conditioned medium from a. castellanii showed remarkable bactericidal properties against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) exhibiting almost 100% kill rate, but had limited effect against acinetobacter sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre). similarly, the conditioned  medium of e. coli k1 and enterobacter sp., exhibited potent anti-acanthamoebic effects in a concentration-dependent manner. conditioned media of acanthamoeba, e. coli k1 and enterobacter sp. showed no cytotoxicity in vitro when tested against human brain microvascular endothelial cells. active molecule/s in aforementioned amoebic and two bacterial conditioned media were 5 - 10 kda, and <5 kda respectively. conclusions: a. castellanii conditioned medium showed potent bactericidal properties against mrsa. the active molecule(s) are heat- and pronase-resistant, and in the 5 to 10 kda molecular mass range. contrary to this, e. coli k1 and enterobacter sp., conditioned medium showed anti-amoebic effects that are <5 kda in molecular mass, suggestive of active metabolites.

AB  == background: salivary contamination of surgical wounds in clean-contaminated head  and neck surgery with free flap reconstruction remains a major cause of infection and leads to significant morbidity. this study investigates the correlation between intraoral flora and surgical site infections (ssis) among high-risk head  and neck cancer patients undergoing resection and free flap reconstruction. methods: one hundred twenty-nine patients were identified as being at high risk for infective complications based on cancer stage, tumor size, comorbid factors,  and extent of reconstruction. all patients had intraoral swab cultures before surgery. patients with culture-confirmed ssi after surgery were chosen for analysis, using the kappa index and its 95% confidence interval for concordance analysis. all patients received clindamycin and gentamicin for antibiotic prophylaxis for 5 days. antibiotic susceptibility testing of all isolates was obtained and analyzed. results: thirty-seven patients experienced ssi, or an infection rate of 28.3%, occurring at a mean of 9.3 postoperative days. the overall concordance between oral flora and ssi was fair to moderate (kappa index  of 0.25), but detailed analysis shows a higher concordance for known and opportunistic pathogens, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, compared to typical oral commensals. antibiotic susceptibility tests show rapid and significant increases in resistance to clindamycin, indicating a need for a more effective alternative. conclusions: predicting pathogens in ssi using preoperative oral swabs did not demonstrate a good concordance in general for patients undergoing clean-contaminated head and neck surgery, although concordance for certain pathogenic species seem to be higher than for typical intraoral commensals. the rapid development of resistance to clindamycin precludes its use as a prophylactic agent.

TI  == antibacterial activity of resin rich plant extracts.
AB  == background: the in vitro antibacterial activity of resin rich methanolic extracts (rrmes) of commiphora myrrha, operculina turpethum, and pinus roxburghii. materials and methods: different concentration were studied by agar-well diffusion method against gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacterial strains (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella dysenteriae). results: among all the bacterial strains tested, e. faecalis was most sensitive and s. typhi was resistant to c. myrrha and p. roxburghii. the extracts of o. turpethum were active against all tested strains in which b. subtilis and s. aureus were the most sensitive. conclusion: this suggested that the antibacterial activity of rrmes of o. turpethum was more than c. myrrha and p. roxburghii. this probably explains the potential of these plants against a number of infections caused by bacterial strains tested.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection  treatment with photolysis of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 and comparing this with existing antibacterial agents. we tested seven antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, cefepime hydrochloride, erythromycin, ofloxacin, clindamycin hydrochloride, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, and minocycline hydrochloride, as positive controls for validation of the assay protocol. for all of the agents tested, at least one of the four bacterial species (staphylococcus  aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and streptococcus salivarius) was resistant to these agents by repeated exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of the agents up to 10 times. in contrast, antibacterial activity  against any of the bacterial species tested (s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. coli, s.  salivarius, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus mutans, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) was not affected by repeated exposure to the disinfection  treatment up to 40 times. this finding suggested that the risk of inducing bacterial resistance by disinfection treatment was low. the active ingredient of  this disinfection treatment is hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis of h2o2. therefore, hydroxyl radicals interact with several cell structures and different  metabolic pathways in microbial cells, probably resulting in a lack of development of bacterial resistance. in conclusion, disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 appears to be a potential alternative for existing antimicrobial agents in terms of a low risk of inducing bacterial resistance.

TI  == phosphate-containing polyethylene glycol polymers prevent lethal sepsis by multidrug-resistant pathogens.
AB  == antibiotic resistance among highly pathogenic strains of bacteria and fungi is a  growing concern in the face of the ability to sustain life during critical illness with advancing medical interventions. the longer patients remain critically ill, the more likely they are to become colonized by multidrug-resistant (mdr) pathogens. the human gastrointestinal tract is the primary site of colonization of many mdr pathogens and is a major source of life-threatening infections due to these microorganisms. eradication measures to  sterilize the gut are difficult if not impossible and carry the risk of further antibiotic resistance. here, we present a strategy to contain rather than eliminate mdr pathogens by using an agent that interferes with the ability of colonizing pathogens to express virulence in response to host-derived and local environmental factors. the antivirulence agent is a phosphorylated triblock high-molecular-weight polymer (here termed pi-peg 15-20) that exploits the known  properties of phosphate (pi) and polyethylene glycol 15-20 (peg 15-20) to suppress microbial virulence and protect the integrity of the intestinal epithelium. the compound is nonmicrobiocidal and appears to be highly effective when tested both in vitro and in vivo. structure functional analyses suggest that the hydrophobic bis-aromatic moiety at the polymer center is of particular importance to the biological function of pi-peg 15-20, beyond its phosphate content. animal studies demonstrate that pi-peg prevents mortality in mice inoculated with multiple highly virulent pathogenic organisms from hospitalized patients in association with preservation of the core microbiome.

TI  == [surveillance of bacterial distribution and drug resistance in inpatients with surgical infections: a single center study].
AB  == objective: to investigate the bacterial distribution and drug resistance in patients with surgical infections, and provide the basis for the standardization  treatment of the surgical infection. methods: retrospectively analyzed from january 2008 to december 2011 surgical infection in our samples bacteria identification and drug sensitivity test results. results: a total of 3829 nonduplicate isolates from 3257 samples, gram-negative bacteria accounted for 62.4% (the main microbes were p.aeruginosa, k. pneumonia and e.coli etc) and gram-positive bacteria accounted for 37.6% (the main microbes were enterococcus,  staphylococcus and coagulase negative staphylococcus). incidence of staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis were on an obvious increase. for  the performance of the high level of sensitive to imipenem, amikacin, piperacillin and tazobactam by e. coli and k. pneumonia. the pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii to cephalosporins, carbapenems and fluoroqinolones were higher resistant with multidrug resistance. no vancomycin and teicoplanin resistant enterococcus faecium were found. the prevalence of esbl e.coli was 45.6%-61.5% and esbl k.pneumoniae isolates were fluctuated. the methicillin-resistant s.aureus (mrsa) isolates were relatively high (21.1%-55.8%), and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis was higher than the other gram-positive cocci. vancomycin for staphylococcus performance was highly sensitive. conclusions: the main composition of surgical clinical infection pathogens are gram-negative bacillus, and the emergency of resistance of bacteria to antibacterial drugs is a common phenomenon. the resistant rate shows ascendant trend; drug resistance is significantly higher in pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. antimicrobial resistance is a serious and challenging issue.

TI  == comparison of bacteria isolated from emergency department patients versus hospitalized patients.
AB  == purpose: the frequencies and corresponding susceptibilities of bacteria isolated  from patients in the emergency department (ed) were compared with those from hospitalized patients. methods: a microbiology laboratory report of all positive  bacterial cultures obtained in the ed, regardless of the source (e.g., blood, urine, sputum), was obtained. in the case of duplicate cultures, only the first isolate cultured from a single patient was included. colonization-site cultures (e.g., nasal swabs) and culture reports identified by the laboratory as contaminant organisms were excluded from the evaluation. antimicrobial susceptibility results were then compiled into a standardized ed-specific antibiogram. antimicrobial susceptibilities for each pathogen in the ed antibiogram were compared with those in the hospitalwide antibiogram. if there was a difference of >/=5% between the susceptibility of a single antimicrobial agent, chi-square tests were conducted, and unadjusted odds ratios were calculated. pathogens with fewer than 30 isolates were excluded from the susceptibility comparison. results: a total of 3140 cultures were evaluated (1417 from the ed, 1723 from the hospital). the frequencies of pathogens isolated in the ed and hospitalwide were similar, with the exception of escherichia coli, which were more commonly isolated in ed patients, and enterococcus species and pseudomonas aeruginosa, which were more common in hospitalized patients. significant differences in susceptibility profiles were identified for staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, enterococcus faecalis,  e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and p. aeruginosa. conclusion: significant differences in the frequencies of bacteria isolated and corresponding susceptibilities were found in cultures obtained in ed patients compared with those obtained in hospitalized patients.

TI  == prevalence of the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase genes aph(3')-iiia and aph(3')-iia in escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica and staphylococcus aureus isolates in austria.
AB  == the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase aph(3')-iia primarily inactivates kanamycin and neomycin, whilst aph(3')-iiia also inactivates amikacin. the aim of this study was to determine the frequency of both resistance genes in major human pathogens to obtain their baseline prevalence in the gene pool of these bacterial populations in austria. in total, 10 541 escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica and staphylococcus aureus isolates were collected representatively without selection bias between 2008 and 2011. isolates were analysed by aph(3')-iiia/nptiii- and aph(3')-iia/nptii-specific taqman real-time pcr. for positive strains, mics using etests were performed and resistance gene sequences  were determined. the overall prevalence of aph(3')-iiia/nptiii was 1.62 % (95 % confidence interval: 1.38-1.88 %). in escherichia coli, enterococci, staphylococcus aureus, p. aeruginosa and salmonella spp., the aph(3')-iiia/nptiii prevalence was 0.47 % (0-1.47 %), 37.53 % (32.84-42.40 %), 2.90 % (1.51-5.02 %),  0 % (0-0.32 %) and 0 % (0-0.037 %), respectively. eleven of a total of 169 carriers showed single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the resistance allele. the overall prevalence of aph(3')-iia/nptii was 0.0096 % (0-0.046 %). escherichia coli (0-0.70 %), enterococci (0-0.75 %), staphylococcus aureus (0-0.73 %) and p.  aeruginosa (0-0.32 %) did not carry aph(3')-iia. a single salmonella isolate was  positive, resulting in an aph(3')-iia prevalence of 0.013 % (0-0.058 %). aph(3')-iiia/nptiii carriers were moderately prevalent in the strains tested except for in enterococci, which appeared to be an important reservoir for aph(3')-iiia. aph(3')-iia/nptii genes were detected at clinically irrelevant frequencies and played no significant role in the aminoglycoside resistance gene  pool during the observation period.

TI  == antimicrobial efficacy of mineral trioxide aggregate with and without silver nanoparticles.
AB  == introduction: most current root-end filling materials do not provide a perfect seal. thus, a microscopic space is likely to exist in the interface between walls of the root-end cavity and filling material, which allows microorganisms and their products to penetrate. in addition to good sealing ability and biocompatibility, root-end filling materials should ideally have some antimicrobial activity. therefore, this in vitro study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of angelus white mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) and the mixture of mta with silver nanoparticles (1% weight; mta/sn). materials and methods: antimicrobial properties of mta and mta/sn were tested by agar diffusion technique against enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and candida albicans. the microbial inhibition zones around the materials were measured by a caliper with 0.1-mm accuracy. student's t-test was used for comparison between the two groups in normal data distribution and man-whitney u test for non-normal distribution. results: student's t-test revealed that for e.  faecalis, c. albicans, and p. aeruginosa, microbial inhibition zone of mta/sn was significantly greater than that of mta (p = 0.000). mann-whitney u test indicated no significant difference between the effect of mta and mta/sn on s. aureus (p >  0.05). conclusion: based on the results of this study, adding silver nanoparticles to mta improved its antimicrobial efficacy.

TI  == prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of canine urinary tract pathogens.
AB  == this study aims to describe the incidence and risk factors for positive urinary tract culture, the prevalence of urinary tract pathogens in single organism and mixed cultures and changes in their antimicrobial resistance over 10 years. a retrospective review of computer records detailing canine urine samples submitted between august 1999 and september 2009 for culture and sensitivity in a uk tertiary referral hospital is described. 17.5 per cent of 5923 samples (670 of 4530 dogs) were positive cultures. 85.3 per cent of cultures yielded a single isolate. the prevalence of bacterial species differed between mixed and single isolate cultures. entire and neutered female dogs were more likely to return positive cultures than male dogs (or=2.5 and 1.5, respectively). escherichia coli was most commonly isolated (53.9 per cent) and affected female dogs, older dogs and neutered dogs more. there was an increase in the antimicrobial resistance of  enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and a decrease in the effectiveness of enrofloxacin, cephalexin and oxytetracycline. the prevalence of  urinary bacterial isolates is described for a large group of dogs. monitoring changes in antimicrobial efficacy and microbial resistance guides the empirical use of antimicrobials for the treatment of urinary tract infection and helps formulate strategic plans to limit drug resistance.

TI  == the daf-16/foxo transcription factor functions as a regulator of epidermal innate immunity.
AB  == the caenorhabditis elegans daf-16 transcription factor is critical for diverse biological processes, particularly longevity and stress resistance. disruption of the daf-2 signaling cascade promotes daf-16 activation, and confers resistance to killing by pathogenic bacteria, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. however, daf-16 mutants exhibit similar sensitivity to these bacteria as wild-type animals, suggesting that daf-16 is not normally activated by these bacterial pathogens. in this report, we demonstrate that daf-16 can be directly activated by fungal infection and wounding in wild-type animals, which is independent of the daf-2 pathway. fungal infection and wounding initiate the galphaq signaling cascade, leading to ca(2+) release. ca(2+) mediates the activation of bli-3, a dual-oxidase, resulting in the production of reactive oxygen species (ros). ros then activate daf-16 through a ste20-like kinase-1/cst-1. our results indicate that daf-16 in the epidermis is required for survival after fungal infection and wounding. thus, the egl-30-ca(2+)-bli-3-cst-1-daf-16 signaling represents a previously unknown pathway to regulate epidermal damage response.

TI  == bi-directional-bi-dimensionality alignment of self-supporting mn3o4 nanorod and nanotube arrays with different bacteriostasis and magnetism.
AB  == self-supported mn3o4 patterns of aligned nanorods and nanotubes were synthesized  through a bi-directional-bi-dimensionality growth model by using sodium gluconate and urea as additives under mild hydrothermal conditions without the use of any substrates. in one direction, mn3o4 grows to form one-dimensional nanorods or nanotubes, while in the other direction mn3o4 grows into two-dimensional nanoplates to support the nanorods or nanotubes to align into arrays. these two kinds of new nanostructures, a nanotube pattern and a nanorod pattern, show similar and good bacteriostasis for gram positive bacteria, but for gram negative bacteria the nanotube pattern shows much better bacterial restraint than the nanorod pattern. magnetic studies show that the nanorod arrays display similar magnetic properties to the commercial mn3o4, while the nanotube arrays show different ferromagnetic behaviors with enhanced remnant magnetization and saturation magnetization (ms) at low temperature.

TI  == isolation and partial characterization of bacteria (pseudoalteromonas sp.) with potential antibacterial activity from a marine costal environment from new caledonia.
AB  == marine bacteria are a rich source of bioactive metabolites. however, the microbial diversity of marine ecosystem still needs to be explored. the aim of this study was to isolate and characterize bacteria with antimicrobial activities from various marine coastal environment of new caledonia. we obtained 493 marine  isolates from various environments and samples of which 63 (12.8%) presented an antibacterial activity against a panel of reference pathogenic strains (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis). ten out of the most promising strains were cultured, fractionated and  screened for antibacterial activity. four of them (nc282, nc412, nc272 and nc120) showed at least an activity against reference and multidrug-resistant pathogenic  strains and were found to belong to the genus pseudoalteromonas, according to the 16s phylogenetic analysis. the nc282 strain does not belong to any described pseudoalteromonas species and might be of interest for further chemical and biological characterization. these findings suggest that the identified strains may contribute to the discovery for new sources of antimicrobial substances to develop new therapies to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria. significance and impact of the study: with the constant increasing of bacterial resistance against known antibiotics in worldwide public health, it is now necessary to find new sources of antimicrobials. marine bacteria from new caledonia were isolated, tested for antibacterial activity and characterized to find new active molecules against multidrug-resistant bacteria. this study illustrates the diversity of the marine ecosystem with potent new bacteria species. also the potential of marine bacteria as a rich source of bioactive molecule, for example antibiotics, is highlighted.

TI  == intermediate-level disinfection with accelerated hydrogen peroxide prevents accumulation of bacteria in versajet tubing during repeated daily debridement using simulated-use testing with an inoculated pork hock.
AB  == objective: this study assesses the feasibility of using the versajet system (vjs) on an inoculated pork hock (ph) skin surface sequentially for 8 days with daily cleaning and intermediate-level disinfection (ild). methods: daily, phs were inoculated with bacteria suspended in artificial test soil (ats). an ild protocol with accelerated hydrogen peroxide (ahp, oxivirtb((r))) was employed to clean and disinfect the vjs between debridements. results: ph skin contains 6.1-6.8x10(6)cfu/cm(2) bacteria. bacterial counts in the handpiece and discharge  hoses immediately after debridement of the phs, and before cleaning, increased throughout the study period (5.19-6.43log10cfu/ml). cleaning with the ild protocol was reduced bacterial counts on the vjs by 6-log. protein, a surrogate marker of organic contamination, was also reduced post-cleaning and ild. compared to a maximum post-debridement level of protein (57.9 mug/ml) obtained before ild, vjs protein levels dropped to 9.8 (handpiece) and 13.8 mug/ml (discharge hose). conclusions: disinfection of the handpiece and discharge hose after debridement with ahp resulted in a 6-log reduction in bacterial count and 4.2 fold reduction  in protein. an ild protocol with an ahp may be a feasible method for serial skin  surface debridements with the vjs for up to eight days.

TI  == retained temporary epicardial pacing wires: a rare cause of prosthetic valve endocarditis.
AB  == temporary epicardial pacing wires (tepws) are commonly used during cardiac surgery to meet unforeseen complications like heart blocks or asystole. these are generally considered to be safe. the incidence of major complications with their  use is low, but could be life threatening. complications can be divided into those encountered during placement, removal, or retention of temporary epicardial pacing wires. we report a rare case of prosthetic mitral valve endocarditis caused by tepws that migrated into the pulmonary artery, presenting 5 months following mitral and aortic valve replacement surgery that required percutaneous  removal of these temporary pacing wires via a right femoral vein approach. this case highlights the fact that delayed complications can rarely occur due to retained tepws and may have serious consequences. this fact should be taken into  account when the strategy on dealing with such wires following cardiac surgery is determined. routine retention of temporary epicardial pacing wires is not recommended.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of some medicinal plants from the cerrado of the centralwestern region of brazil.
AB  == ethanol extracts from six selected species from the cerrado of the central-western region of brazil, which are used in traditional medicine for the  treatment of infectious diseases and other medical conditions, namely erythroxylum suberosum st. hil. (erythroxylaceae), hyptis crenata pohl. ex benth. (lamiaceae), roupala brasiliensis klotz. (proteaceae), simarouba versicolor st. hil. (simaroubaceae), guazuma ulmifolia lam. (sterculiaceae) and protium heptaphyllum (aubl.) march. (burseraceae), as well as fractions resulting from partition of these crude extracts, were screened in vitro for their antifungal and antibacterial properties. the antimicrobial activities were assessed by the broth microdilution assay against six control fungal strains, candida albicans, c. glabrata, c. krusei, c. parapsilosis, c. tropicalis and cryptococcus neoformans, and five control gram-positive and negative bacterial strains, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. toxicity of the extracts and fractions against artemia salina was also evaluated in this work. all plants investigated showed antimicrobial properties against at least one microorganism and two species were also significantly toxic to brine shrimp larvae. the results tend to support the traditional use of these plants for the treatment of respiratory and  gastrointestinal disorders and/or skin diseases, opening the possibility of finding new antimicrobial agents from these natural sources. among the species investigated, hyptis crenata, erythroxylum suberosum and roupala brasiliensis were considered the most promising candidates for developing of future bioactivity-guided phytochemical investigations.

TI  == the antimicrobial screening of a barbadian medicinal plant with indications for use in the treatment of diabetic wound infections.
AB  == objective: diabetes mellitus is a chronic non-communicable disease with high prevalence in the north american and caribbean region. diabetic foot syndrome which is an associated complication can lead to the development of wounds and ulcers which can become infected. justicia secunda, a plant known locally in barbados as bloodroot used in folklore for wound healing, was selected to test its ability to aid diabetic wound healing by antimicrobial activity. it was therefore tested against the bacteria staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, and enterococcus feacalis (clincal strain) which are commonly found in diabetic wounds. methods: the plant was collected by  local users. methanol and acetone extracts of the plant were prepared with use of soxhlet extraction. the antimicrobial activity was assessed with the use of a modified kirby-baurer method. concentrations of 200 mg/ml, 100 mg/ml, 10 mg/ml, and 1 mg/ml of the extract were used, with a standard ciprofloxacin 5 microg positive control, and a 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (dmso) solution negative control. results: the j secunda methanol and acetone extracts with an extraction yield of  15.3% and 0.75%, respectively yielded no activity within the concentration range  against the three strains of bacteria tested. in comparison with the positive control, relative inhibition zone diameter (rizd) values of 0% resulted for both  the negative control and the extracts, with the positive control having a value of 100%. conclusion: the in vitro screen of the extracts prepared from j secunda, yielded no antimicrobial activity against the three strains of bacteria tested and therefore does not support the folklore claims by this mechanism of action.

TI  == lysozyme-encapsulated gold nanocluster-based affinity mass spectrometry for pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == rationale: bacterial infections can be difficult to treat and can lead to irreversible damage to patients if proper treatment is not provided in time. additionally, the emerging threat from antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains makes medical treatment even more difficult. thus, rapid identification of infected bacterial strains is essential to assist diagnostics and medical treatment. methods: lysozymes are glycoside hydrolases that can bind with peptidoglycans on bacterial cell walls. in this work, we demonstrated that lysozyme-encapsulated gold nanoclusters (lysozyme-auncs) with red photoluminescence can be used as affinity probes to concentrate pathogenic bacteria. after bacteria had been probed by the lysozyme-auncs in a sample solution, the lysozyme-aunc-bacteria conjugates were readily spun down at a low centrifugation speed. the red emission from the auncs on the conjugates could be  visualized with the naked eye under illumination of ultraviolet light. the bacteria in the conjugates can be identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (maldi-ms) combined with principal component analysis (pca). results: we demonstrated that pathogenic bacteria including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pandrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre) can be readily concentrated by the lysozyme-auncs and distinguished by the results combining maldi-ms and pca. additionally, the possibility of using the current approach to  differentiate e. faecalis from vre was also demonstrated. the lowest detection concentration for e. coli using the current approach is ~10(6) cells/ml. conclusions: the results indicated that the lysozyme-auncs are effective affinity probes for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. by combining the results from maldi-ms and pca, different bacteria can be easily distinguished. the current approach can be potentially used to assist the identification of bacteria from biological fluids.

TI  == the diversity and antimicrobial activity of preussia sp. endophytes isolated from australian dry rainforests.
AB  == limited knowledge currently exists regarding species diversity and antimicrobial  activity of endophytic isolates of preussia within australia. this report describes endophytic preussia species that were identified through molecular analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region. screening for antimicrobial secondary metabolites was determined by testing crude ethyl acetate (etoac) extracts derived from fungal mycelia against a panel of atcc type strains which included bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and the opportunist yeast pathogen candida albicans. subsequently, high-performance liquid chromatography generated fractions of bioactive etoac extracts which were subject to confirmatory testing using the clinical and laboratory standards institute reference microdilution antimicrobial activity assay. a total of 18 preussia were isolated from nine host plants with 6/18 having a <97 % sequence similarity to other known species in genbank, suggesting  that they are new species. in preliminary screening, 13/18 preussia isolates revealed antimicrobial activity against at least one of the microbes tested, whilst 6/18 isolates, including 4/6 putative new species showed specific antimicrobial activity against mrsa and c. albicans. these results highlight the  antimicrobial potential of australian preussia spp. and also the importance of australian dry rainforests as an untapped repository of potentially significant bioactive compounds.

TI  == [comparison of in vitro antimicrobial activities of bioaggregate and mineral trioxide aggregate].
AB  == treatment outcome of endodontic perforations depends on successful elimination of the associated microorganisms and infected tissues as well as the effective seal  of the root-end or perforation site to prevent future contamination. ideally, perforation repair material has to be bacteriostatic or bactericidal in order to  prevent bacterial contamination as well as good sealing properties and biocompatibility. the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of bioaggregate (ba) and mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) on the standard strains of candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis and pseudomonas aeruginosa using the agar disc diffusion test. colonies of each strains were harvested from the medium and microorganisms were diluted to obtain a suspension of approximately 108 cfu/ml. petri plates with blood agar base with 5% sheep blood or sabouraud dextrose agar  (for c.albicans) were inoculated with experimental suspensions and ba and mta discs prepared as 2 mm length and 6 mm diameter were placed. after 24 and 48 hours incubation, the diameters of the zones of inhibition were measured. the results of the disc diffusion tests showed that ba and mta were effective on the  tested microorganisms at 24 and 48 hours incubation periods. ba and mta showed similar antimicrobial effects on c.albicans and e.coli. ba was more effective than mta on s.mutans, e.faecalis and p.aeruginosa, however mta was more effective than ba on s.sanguinis at 48 hours. when the time efficiency of the materials were compared, there was no statistically difference between 24 to 48 hours on e.coli, e.faecalis, s.mutans, s.sanguinis in both two groups (p> 0.05). there was statistically significant decrease 24 to 48 hours on c.albicans in ba and mta groups and p.aeruginosa in ba group (p< 0.05). it can be concluded that although  ba and mta displayed similar antimicrobial efficacy on the tested microorganisms  newly improved material ba demonstrated superior antimicrobial activity than other.

TI  == rapid detection of bacteria in urine samples by the "three-plug-injection" method using capillary electrophoresis.
AB  == this study explored a method that can rapidly detect bacteria in urine samples for the auxiliary determination of urinary tract infections (utis). urine samples from patients with utis (230 cases) were obtained using aseptic technique. the urine biochemical assay was then carried out using an automated urine analyzer for all the urine samples. bacterial species were identified by a combination of  bacterial culture technique, morphological observation and the bact-ist microbial identification/susceptibility analysis system. the most common seven species of bacteria in the study included escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. bacterial samples were suspended in sample buffer solutions and separated by the "three-plug-injection"  method using capillary electrophoresis (ce). each species of bacteria appeared as a bacterial peak. the mixture of the seven species also provided only one peak. further analysis showed that the concentration limit for the "three-plug-injection" method is 10(6) colony forming units (cfu)/ml, and there is a good linear relationship between the peak height and bacterial concentration (r(2)=0.99). the effect of urine composition on ce results was also investigated. the results showed that urine composition, i.e., proteins, white blood cells (wbcs) and red blood cells (rbcs), affected the peak retention time but could not affect the separation of bacteria. the results demonstrated that the bacteria in  urine samples can be detected within 10min by the "three-plug-injection" method using ce. the "three-plug-injection" method is therefore suitable for the rapid detection of organisms in clinical urine samples from utis.

TI  == interdigitated silver-polymer-based antibacterial surface system activated by oligodynamic iontophoresis - an empirical characterization study.
AB  == there is a pressing need to control the occurrences of nosocomial infections due  to their detrimental effects on patient well-being and the rising treatment costs. to prevent the contact transmission of such infections via health-critical surfaces, a prophylactic surface system that consists of an interdigitated array  of oppositely charged silver electrodes with polymer separations and utilizes oligodynamic iontophoresis has been recently developed. this paper presents a systematic study that empirically characterizes the effects of the surface system parameters on its antibacterial efficacy, and validates the system's effectiveness. in the first part of the study, a fractional factorial design of experiments (doe) was conducted to identify the statistically significant system  parameters. the data were used to develop a first-order response surface model to predict the system's antibacterial efficacy based on the input parameters. in the second part of the study, the effectiveness of the surface system was validated by evaluating it against four bacterial species responsible for several nosocomial infections - staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococcus faecalis - alongside non-antibacterial polymer (acrylic) control surfaces. the system demonstrated statistically significant efficacy against all four bacteria. the results indicate that given a constant total effective surface area, the system designed with micro-scale features (minimum feature width: 20 mum) and activated by 15 mua direct current will provide the most effective antibacterial prophylaxis.

TI  == direction of aminoacylated transfer rnas into antibiotic synthesis and peptidoglycan-mediated antibiotic resistance.
AB  == prokaryotic aminoacylated-transfer rnas often need to be efficiently segregated between translation and other cellular biosynthetic pathways. many clinically relevant bacteria, including streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa direct some aminoacylated-trna species into peptidoglycan biosynthesis and/or membrane phospholipid modification. subsequent indirect peptidoglycan cross-linkage or change in membrane permeability is often a prerequisite for high-level antibiotic resistance. in streptomycetes, aminoacylated-trna species are used for antibiotic synthesis as well as antibiotic resistance. the direction of coding aminoacylated-trna molecules away from translation and into antibiotic resistance and synthesis pathways are discussed in this review.

TI  == electrokinetic stringency control in self-assembled monolayer-based biosensors for multiplex urinary tract infection diagnosis.
AB  == rapid detection of bacterial pathogens is critical toward judicious management of infectious diseases. herein, we demonstrate an in situ electrokinetic stringency  control approach for a self-assembled monolayer-based electrochemical biosensor toward urinary tract infection diagnosis. the in situ electrokinetic stringency control technique generates joule heating induced temperature rise and electrothermal fluid motion directly on the sensor to improve its performance for detecting bacterial 16s rrna, a phylogenetic biomarker. the dependence of the hybridization efficiency reveals that in situ electrokinetic stringency control is capable of discriminating single-base mismatches. with electrokinetic stringency control, the background noise due to the matrix effects of clinical urine samples can be reduced by 60%. the applicability of the system is demonstrated by multiplex detection of three uropathogenic clinical isolates with similar 16s rrna sequences. the results demonstrate that electrokinetic stringency control can significantly improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the biosensor for multiplex urinary tract infection diagnosis. from the clinical editor: urinary tract infections remain a significant cause of mortality and morbidity as secondary conditions often related to chronic diseases or to immunosuppression. rapid and sensitive identification of the causative organisms  is critical in the appropriate management of this condition. these investigators  demonstrate an in situ electrokinetic stringency control approach for a self-assembled monolayer-based electrochemical biosensor toward urinary tract infection diagnosis, establishing that such an approach significantly improves the biosensor's signal-to-noise ratio.

TI  == quantitative detection of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa in human oral epithelial cells from subjects with periodontitis and periodontal health.
AB  == epithelial cells in oral cavities can be considered reservoirs for a variety of bacterial species. a polymicrobial intracellular flora associated with periodontal disease has been demonstrated in buccal cells. important aetiological agents of systemic and nosocomial infections have been detected in the microbiota of subgingival biofilm, especially in individuals with periodontal disease. however, non-oral pathogens internalized in oral epithelial cells and their relationship with periodontal status are poorly understood. the purpose of this study was to detect opportunistic species within buccal and gingival crevice epithelial cells collected from subjects with periodontitis or individuals with good periodontal health, and to associate their prevalence with periodontal clinical status. quantitative detection of total bacteria and staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis in oral epithelial cells was determined by quantitative real-time pcr using universal and species-specific primer sets. intracellular bacteria were visualized by confocal microscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridization. overall, 33% of cell samples from patients with periodontitis contained at least one opportunistic species, compared with 15% of samples from healthy individuals. e. faecalis was the most prevalent species found in oral epithelial cells (detected in 20.6% of patients with periodontitis, p = 0.03 versus healthy individuals) and was detected only in cells from patients with periodontitis. quantitative real-time pcr showed that high levels of p. aeruginosa and s. aureus were present in both the periodontitis and healthy groups. however, the proportion of these species was significantly higher in epithelial cells of subjects with periodontitis compared with healthy individuals (p = 0.016 for p. aeruginosa and p = 0.047 for s. aureus). although e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa were detected in 57% and 50% of patients, respectively, with probing depth and clinical attachment level >/=6 mm, no correlation was found with age, sex, bleeding on probing or the presence of supragingival biofilm. the prevalence of these pathogens in epithelial cells is correlated with the state of periodontal disease.

TI  == antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, and phenolic compounds of selected inula species from turkey.
AB  == three inula species, i. viscosa, i. helenium ssp. turcoracemosa and i. montbretiana, collected from different locations of anatolia were investigated for their antioxidant and antimicrobial potential, and their total phenolic content and phenolic composition. antioxidant activities of various extracts of the plant parts were measured using dpph radical scavenging and abts assays. antimicrobial potential of methanol extracts of the plant parts was determined by the agar dilution method against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and candida tropicalis. all the extracts were more active against gram-positive bacteria and  yeasts than gram-negative bacteria. the extracts exhibited antioxidant and antimicrobial activities in different concentrations. total phenolic concentration of the extracts was estimated with folin-ciocalteu reagent using gallic acid as standard. the total phenolic content varied widely in different parts of the three tested inula species, ranging from 21.1 +/- 0.8 to 190.9 +/- 6.1 mg gae/g extract. phenolic components, such as chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, myricetin, quercetin, luteolin and kaempferol were quantified by hplc-dad in the methanol extracts of the inula species. it was obvious that the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of the plants were due to the phenolics.

TI  == epidemiology of urinary tract infection among spinal cord injured patients in rehabilitation ward at siriraj hospital.
AB  == background and objective: a prophylactic antibiotic in retrograde investigations  (ix) such as an urodynamic study was suggested by the european association of urology in order to prevent urinary tract infection (uti) in the neurogenic bladder however finding an appropriate antibiotic is questionable since bacterial types and their sensitivities are variable in different settings. therefore, the  present study was aimed to find out the epidemiology of uti in spinal cord injured (sci) patients within the rehabilitation ward at siriraj hospital. material and method: a retrospective chart review of 100 sci patients admitted to the rehabilitation ward between 2006 and 2010 was done. symptomatic uti events, urine cultures, and sensitivities (c/s) were reviewed demographic data and possible uti-associated factors were collected and examined the association with  the occurrence of uti results: there were 64 males and 36 females with a mean age of 42.9 (sd 15.8) years. most of them (77%) were injured at cervical and thoracic spinal cords. forty-five patients had 57 uti episodes. escherichia coli was the most common isolated pathogen (50%), followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.3%),  and enterococcus faecalis (7.7%). the top three most sensitive antibiotics were imipenem, amikacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. unfortunately, gentamicin, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin, which were frequently used as a prophylactic antibiotic, had the efficacy for only 51.9%, 38.5%, and 28.8% ofpathogens respectively. the mean length ofstay ofpatients with uti was far greater than non-uti patients, 45.5 (sd 24.4) versus 30.4 (sd 14.8) days (p = 0.001). vesicoureteric reflux (vur) (or 21.2, 95% ci2.1 to 214.2) and increased intravesical pressure at storage phase (or 1.1, 95% ci 1.004-1.113) were significant risk factors for post investigation uti. conclusion: uti was commonly observed in sci patients within the rehabilitation ward the most common uropathogen was escherichia coli. therefore, a prophylactic antibiotic such as amikacin should be prescribed in patients with vur and increased intravesical pressure at storage phase.

TI  == anti-infective potential of marine invertebrates and seaweeds from the brazilian  coast.
AB  == this manuscript describes the evaluation of anti-infective potential in vitro of  organic extracts from nine sponges, one ascidian, two octocorals, one bryozoan, and 27 seaweed species collected along the brazilian coast. antimicrobial activity was tested against staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853), escherichia coli (atcc 25922) and candida albicans (atcc 10231) by the disk diffusion method. antiprotozoal activity was evaluated against leishmania braziliensis (mhom/br/96/lsc96-h3) promastigotes and trypanosoma cruzi (mhom/br/00/y) epimastigotes by mtt assay. activity against intracellular amastigotes of t. cruzi and l. brasiliensis in murine macrophages was also evaluated. antiviral activity was tested against herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1, kos strain) by the plaque number reduction assay (ic(5)(0)). cytotoxicity on vero cells was evaluated by the mtt assay (cc(5)(0)). the results were expressed as si = cc(5)(0)/ic(5)(0). the most promising antimicrobial results were obtained against s. aureus and c. albicans with dragmacidon reticulatum. among the seaweeds, only  osmundaria obtusiloba showed moderate activity against p. aeruginosa. concerning  antiprotozoal activity, bugula neritina, carijoa riseii, dragmaxia anomala and haliclona (halichoclona) sp. showed the most interesting results, mainly against  extracellular promastigote forms of l. braziliensis (66, 35.9, 97.2, and 43.6% inhibition, respectively). moreover, six species of seaweeds anadyomene saldanhae, caulerpa cupressoides, canistrocarpus cervicornis, dictyota sp., ochtodes secundiramea, and padina sp. showed promising results against l. braziliensis (87.9, 51.7, 85.9, 93.3, 99.7, and 80.9% inhibition, respectively),  and only dictyota sp. was effective against t. cruzi (60.4% inhibition). finally, the antiherpes activity was also evaluated, with haliclona (halichoclona) sp. and petromica citrina showing the best results (si = 11.9 and si > 5, respectively).  all the active extracts deserve special attention in further studies to chemically characterize the bioactive compounds, and to perform more refined biological assays.

TI  == volatile metabolites of pathogens: a systematic review.
AB  == ideally, invading bacteria are detected as early as possible in critically ill patients: the strain of morbific pathogens is identified rapidly, and antimicrobial sensitivity is known well before the start of new antimicrobial therapy. bacteria have a distinct metabolism, part of which results in the production of bacteria-specific volatile organic compounds (vocs), which might be used for diagnostic purposes. volatile metabolites can be investigated directly in exhaled air, allowing for noninvasive monitoring. the aim of this review is to provide an overview of vocs produced by the six most abundant and pathogenic bacteria in sepsis, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli. such vocs could be used as biological markers in the diagnostic approach of critically ill patients. a systematic review of existing literature revealed 31 articles. all six bacteria of interest produce isopentanol, formaldehyde, methyl mercaptan, and trimethylamine. since humans do not produce these vocs, they could serve as biological markers for presence of these pathogens. the following volatile biomarkers were found for identification of specific strains: isovaleric acid and 2-methyl-butanal for staphylococcus aureus; 1-undecene, 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptane, 2-butanone, 4-methyl-quinazoline, hydrogen cyanide, and methyl thiocyanide for pseudomonas aeruginosa; and methanol, pentanol, ethyl acetate, and indole for escherichia coli. notably, several factors that may effect voc production were not controlled for, including used culture media, bacterial growth phase, and genomic variation within bacterial strains. in conclusion, vocs produced by bacteria may serve as biological markers for their presence. goal-targeted studies should be performed to identify potential sets of volatile biological markers and evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of these markers in critically ill patients.

TI  == etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bacterial pathogens from urinary tract infection.
AB  == urinary tract infection (uti) is the most common infection in both community and  hospital patients. in majority of the cases, empirical antimicrobial treatment is practiced before the laboratory results of urine culture. thus, antibiotic resistance may increase in urinary bacterial pathogens due to improper use of drugs. this study was designed to find out the etiological agents of uti and their prevalence, and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the bacterial pathogens isolated from urine culture. this study was conducted in  kathmandu model hospital, kathmandu, nepal from april to october, 2009. midstream urine samples from 1323 patients suspected of uti were analyzed by microscopy, and conventional semi-quantitative culture technique for the significant growth.  antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed for the isolates by modified kirby-bauer disk diffusion method. data were analyzed using spss software window  version 16. the overall prevalence of uti was found to be 18.89%. the most frequent causative organisms isolated were escherichia coli (82.30%), enterococcus faecalis (5.60%), citrobacter freundii (3.60%), enterobacter aerogenes (2.40%), coagulase negative staphylococci (2.40%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.20%), proteus mirabilis (0.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.4%), and staphylococcus aureus (0.4%). nitrofurantoin and amoxycillin were found to be the most effective antibiotic against gram negative and gram positive isolates respectively. e. coli was found to be the most common etiological agent of uti and nitrofurantoin was the most effective drug among the isolates.

TI  == assessment of pathogenic bacteria in treated graywater and irrigated soils.
AB  == reuse of graywater (gw) for irrigation is recognized as a sustainable solution for water conservation. one major impediment for reuse of gw is the possible presence of pathogenic microorganisms. the presence and abundance of six pathogens and indicators were investigated in three gw recirculating vertical flow constructed wetland treatment systems and their respective irrigated yard soils. the treated gw and soils were monitored once every two months for six months using real-time quantitative pcr. as a control, samples from four soils irrigated with fresh water (fw) were similarly analyzed for pathogens and indicators. comparable types of pathogens and fecal indicator bacteria, including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, and shigella spp., were found in the treated gw, their corresponding irrigated soils and the fw-irrigated soils. moreover, the abundance of these bacteria in the gw- and fw-irrigated soils was of the same order of magnitude, suggesting that the source of the pathogens cannot be established. our results suggest that gw irrigation has no effect on the diversity and abundance of the tested pathogens and indicators in yard soils.

TI  == evaluation of pharmacological activities, cytotoxicity and phenolic composition of four maytenus species used in southern african traditional medicine to treat intestinal infections and diarrhoeal diseases.
AB  == background: microbial infections and resulting inflammation and oxidative stress  are common pathogenesis of gastrointestinal tract (git) disorders. in south africa, several species of the genus maytenus are used in traditional medicine to treat various infectious diseases. most of the previous work on this genus was focused on nonpolar extracts from the root and bark. in this study, leaf extracts of polar extracts of maytenus peduncularis, maytenus procumbens, maytenus senegalensis and maytenus undata were evaluated for antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities to determine their efficacy as therapeutic agents in git disorders. methods: phenolic-enriched leaf extracts and fractions were prepared by extracting with acidified 70% methanol and solvent-solvent fractionation. the activities of the fractions against staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterococcus  faecalis as well as clinical isolates of aspergillus fumigatus, candida albicans  and cryptococcus neoformans were determined using a serial microplate dilution method. antioxidant activities were determined using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (dpph), 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (abts), hydroxyl (oh) radical scavenging and linoleic acid peroxidation inhibitory assays. the phenolic composition as well as the cytotoxicity against vero cell lines of the crude extracts was evaluated using various standard protocols. results: the antimicrobial activities were concentrated in the non-polar fractions of hexane,  dichloromethane and ethyl acetate (mics 19-312 mug/ml). the crude extracts and polar fractions (butanol and water) had moderate to poor antimicrobial activity (mics 312 to above 2500 mug/ml). the crude extracts and polar fractions had good  antioxidant activity (ec50 values varied from 1.22 to 607 mug/ml, 1.71 to 312 mug/ml and 23 to 284 mug/ml for dpph, abts and oh respectively. linoleic acid peroxidation inhibition ec50 values of the crude extracts ranged between 27 and 39 mug/ml with relatively low toxicity against vero cell lines (ic50 values 87 to 187 mug/ml). fractionation of a crude extract with low activity could lead to fractions with more potent activity. conclusion: this study justifies the traditional use of leaf crude extracts and fractions from these four plants to remedy gastrointestinal disorders resulting from infection, inflammation and oxidative stress complications. the study also provides rationale for the use of  leaf extracts with same beneficial effects in place of unsustainable root and bark harvest.

TI  == bloodstream infections in patients with or without cancer in a large community hospital.
AB  == purpose: cancer is associated with an increased risk of acquiring bloodstream infection (bsis). most knowledge on pathogens and outcome are derived from specialised cancer centres. we here sought to compare causative micro-organisms in bsis in patients with or without cancer in a 600-bed teaching community hospital. methods: we analysed all positive blood cultures from adult patients between january 2005 and january 2011. results: a total of 4,918 episodes of bsi  occurred in 2,891 patients, of whom 13.4% had a diagnosis of cancer (85.5% with a solid tumour). in both patient groups, gram-positive isolates were more prevalent (58.7 and 61.4% in patients with and without cancer, respectively) than gram-negative isolates (31.8 and 32.3%, respectively). amongst gram-positive organisms, coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus and enterococci were the most frequently isolated in both patient groups; in cancer patients, twice as many bsis were caused by enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. amongst gram-negative organisms, escherichia coli was the most common isolate; in cancer patients, twice as many bsis were caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae. yeasts were grown from 3.0% of blood cultures from cancer patients compared to 1.5% of cultures from non-cancer patients. cancer patients had a 90-day mortality of 35.8% following bsi compared to 23.5% in patients without cancer. conclusion: these data demonstrate distinct bsi pathogens and impaired outcomes in patients with cancer in the setting of a large community teaching hospital.

TI  == surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in indian.
AB  == objective: to record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. methods: urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (uti)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by kirby-bauer's disc  diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. results: from wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during april 2011 to september 2012. two gram-positive, staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis), and nine gram-negative bacteria, acinetobacter baumannii, citrobacter sp., escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. both s. aureus and e. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. particularly, all gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for uti. conclusions: antibiograms of 11 uti-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and s. aureus. moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of s. aureus and e. faecalis is a matter of concern.

TI  == transplantation-associated long-term immunosuppression promotes oral colonization by potentially opportunistic pathogens without impacting other members of the salivary bacteriome.
AB  == solid-organ transplant recipients rely on pharmacological immunosuppression to prevent allograft rejection. the effect of such chronic immunosuppression on the  microflora at mucosal surfaces is not known. we evaluated the salivary bacterial  microbiome of 20 transplant recipients and 19 nonimmunosuppressed controls via 454 pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicons. alpha-diversity and global community structure did not differ between transplant and control subjects. however, principal coordinate analysis showed differences in community membership. taxa more prevalent in transplant subjects included operational taxonomic units (otus) of potentially opportunistic gammaproteobacteria such as klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas fluorescens, acinetobacter species, vibrio species, enterobacteriaceae species, and the genera acinetobacter and klebsiella. transplant subjects also had increased proportions of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter species, enterobacteriaceae species, and enterococcus faecalis, among other otus, while genera with increased proportions included klebsiella, acinetobacter, staphylococcus, and enterococcus. furthermore, in transplant subjects, the dose of the immunosuppressant prednisone positively correlated with bacterial richness, while prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil doses positively correlated with the prevalence and proportions of transplant-associated taxa. correlation network analysis of otu relative abundance revealed a cluster containing potentially opportunistic pathogens as transplant associated. this cluster positively correlated with serum levels of c-reactive protein, suggesting a link between the resident flora at mucosal compartments and systemic inflammation. network connectivity analysis revealed opportunistic pathogens as highly connected to each other and to common oral commensals, pointing to bacterial interactions that may influence colonization. this work demonstrates that immunosuppression aimed at limiting t-cell-mediated responses creates a more permissive oral environment for potentially opportunistic pathogens without affecting other members of the salivary bacteriome.

AB  == an analysis of a series of five peptides composed of various portions of the pleurocidin (plc) sequence identified a l2-amino acid fragment from the c-terminus of plc, designated plc-2, as the smallest fragment that retained a antimicrobial activity comparable to that of the parent compound. mic tests in vitro with low-ionic-strength medium showed that plc-2 has potent activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus but not against enterococcus faecalis. the antifungal activity of the synthetic peptides against phytopathogenic fungi, such as fusarium oxysporum, colletotrichum sp., aspergillus niger and alternaria sp., also identified plc-2 as a biologically active peptide. microscopy studies of fluorescently stained fungi treated with plc-2 demonstrated that cytoplasmic and nuclear membranes were compromised in all strains of phytopathogenic fungi tested. together, these results identify plc-2 as a potential antimicrobial agent with similar properties to its parent compound, pleurocidin. in addition, it demonstrated that the khvgkaalthyl residues are critical for the antimicrobial activity described for pleurocidin.

TI  == cd137 expressed on neutrophils plays dual roles in antibacterial responses against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections.
AB  == severe sepsis and septic shock caused mainly by bacterial infections are life-threatening conditions that urge the development of novel therapies. however, host responses to and pathophysiology of sepsis have not been clearly understood, which remains a major obstacle for the development of effective therapeutics. recently, we have shown that stimulation of a costimulatory molecule, cd137, enhanced survival of mice infected with the gram-positive (g(+)) intracellular bacterium listeria monocytogenes but decreased survival in a polymicrobial sepsis model. herein, we report that cd137 deficiency or blocking of cd137 signaling decreased antibacterial responses of mice infected with g(+) bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis) but increased these responses in mice infected with gram-negative (g(-)) bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium). consistent with these findings, stimulation of cd137 by administration of agonistic antibody enhanced responses against g(+) bacteria, whereas it decreased these responses against g(-) bacteria. neutrophils were responsible for cd137-mediated opposite roles in control of g(+) and g(-) bacterial infections. stimulation of cd137 enhanced activities of neutrophils against s. aureus but decreased these activities against e. coli, while cd137 blocking produced opposite results with the stimulation of cd137 in vivo and in vitro. furthermore, we found that combined signaling of cd137 and toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) induced synergistic production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin-6 (il-6) by neutrophils, but combined signaling of cd137 and tlr4 did not. our data strongly suggest that cd137 may play a dual role in sepsis in association with tlrs.

TI  == in vitro assessment of functional properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from faecal microbiota of healthy dogs for potential use as probiotics.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were isolated and identified in the faeces of chinese crested and yorkshire terrier pups and their probiotic features were investigated in vitro. thirty seven isolates were identified as lactobacillus or enterococcus. out of these isolates, 31 were lactic acid bacteria (lab) and belonged to the species lactobacillus reuteri (16/37; 43.3%), lactobacillus animalis (7/37; 18.9%), lactobacillus acidophilus (3/37; 8.1%), lactobacillus sanfranciscensis (2/37; 5.4%), lactobacillus murinus (2/37; 5.4%), and lactobacillus paraplantarum (1/37; 2.7%), while six other lab isolates were enterococcus spp. (6/37; 16.2%).  strains were tested for resistance to gastric acidity (ph 2.5 for 3 h) and bile salts (0.3% ox gall), cell surface hydrophobicity by microbial adhesion to solvents, antagonism against pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes), production of hydrogen peroxide, and antibiotic susceptibility. thirty four strains were highly resistant to acidic conditions with slight (18 strains) to moderate (16 strains) growth inhibition by bile salts. seven isolates had highly hydrophobic cellular surfaces and 28 strains exhibited strong antagonism against the bacterial pathogens tested, although 8 isolates tested against leptospira interrogans had no effect on pathogen growth. all isolates produced low rates of  hydrogen peroxide. based on these results, two lactobacillus strains showed promising probiotic-related features and merit investigation as probiotics for dogs.

TI  == in vitro biological effects of two anti-diabetic medicinal plants used in benin as folk medicine.
AB  == background: extracts from polygonum senegalensis (polygonaceae) and pseudocedrela kotschyi (meliaceae) are two important traditionally used medicinal plants in rural benin to treat many diseases and notably type 2 diabetes. the aim of the study was to investigate the alpha-glucosidase inhibition, antioxidant and antibacterial activities of those plants extract: polygonum senegalensis leaves,  and pseudocedrela kotschyi root. methods: hydro-alcoholic (50%) extracts were analyzed for their phytochemical content and tested for their inhibition potency  on alpha-glucosidase from saccharomyces cerevisiae. antioxidant activities were assessed using the dpph, orac, frap and dcfh-da (cell based) assay. finally, the  antibacterial activity was evaluated using mic determination on four gram-positive cocci (bacillus subtilis, clostridium difficile, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus), three gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae), and the yeast candida albicans. results: each extract presented significant alpha-glucosidase inhibition and antioxidant activities. polygonum senegalensis leaf extracts were the most active in each in vitro assay with an ic50 = 1.5 mug/ml for alpha-glucosidase inhibition and an ic50 = 6.8 mug/ml for dpph scavenging, - 4.5 mumol fe ii/g of dry matter - 9366 mumol trolox / g dw - for frap and orac values, respectively. ic50 = 2.3 mug ga / ml for dcfh-da assay. concerning its antibacterial activity, a growth inhibitory effect was observed only against three gram negative bacilli: b. subtilis, e. faecalis, s. aureus and the yeast c. albicans at high concentration. conclusion: the results showed that the semi alcoholic extract of the two studied plants possess alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity, antioxidant potency, and low antibacterial effect.

TI  == [microbial and pharmacological characteristics of vancogenx].
AB  == purpose of the study: prosthetic joint infection is a feared complication in total hip arthroplasty. the use of antibiotic-impregnated bone cement is the important part of preventive and therapeutic strategies. at present a number of commercial bone cements are available and support of their use by the results of  experimental trials and clinical studies has varied. in relation to this issue we studied essential microbiological and pharmacological characteristics of vancogenx in comparison with gentamicin-loaded bone cement used conventionally. material and methods: based on a previously described protocol, we tested pellets of four commercial bone cements, namely, hi-fatigue g, palacos r+g, vancogenx, and palacos r as a control. bone cement was prepared in a vacuum-mixing system. the strains used for bacterial load included staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. each cement was tested for its antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities and the results were evaluated by standard methods. in addition, we investigated time-related release of gentamicin and vancomycin from the bone cements tested. results: all antibiotic-loaded cement pellets were able to prevent growth of the bacterial strains tested. the bactericidal effect lasted for several days in relation to the bacterial species and cement used, with the exception of s. epidermidis whose growth was inhibited by gentamicin-loaded cement only for one day. the antibiotic-loaded pellets also prevented the formation of a biofilm for 24 hours at least. the major amount of vancomycin (32.915 mg/l) was released from vancogenx to mh medium within 24 hours and the last measureable amount (4.327 mg/l) was recorded at 48 hours after the start of  the experiment. in physiological saline the highest level of vancomycin was 139.852 mg/ml measured at 24 hours, and the antibiotic was detectable at a level  of 2.334 mg/ml as late as 8 days after the experiment started. release of gentamicin from vancogenx was as follows: the 24-hour level was higher in mh medium than physiological saline (178 versus 131.4 mg/ml); however, gentamicin was still detectable in physiological saline at 192 hours after the start of the  experiment while no gentamicin was found in mh medium after 72 hours. discussion: the antimicrobial effect of vancogenx bone cement was not an unexpected finding since both gentamicin and vancomycin have been used with bone cement for a long time and their combination is optimal in terms of preventing prosthetic joint infection. however, there is a disputable issue of poor release of vancomycin from bone cement. in mh medium we were able to detect the vancomycin released from vancogenx only for two days after the initial rapid elution while its release into physiological saline seemed to be slower but much longer. it is possible that more vancomycin is released from bone cement, but this amount is immediately bound to proteins in the cement vicinity and this process is not detectable by any analytical method. conclusions: the bone cement vancogenx showed excellent antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties and can be recommended  for use in orthopaedic practice. therapy of prosthetic joint infection is the main indication. extension of the indication to the prevention of prosthetic joint infection in high-risk patients should be preceded by biomechanical studies demonstrating that the cement is appropriate for long-term implant fixation.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of essential oils from mediterranean aromatic plants against several foodborne and spoilage bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from a variety of aromatic plants, often used in the portuguese gastronomy was studied in vitro by the agar  diffusion method. the essential oils of thyme, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil, peppermint, pennyroyal and mint were tested against gram-positive (listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus epidermidis) and  gram-negative strains (salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for most essential oils examined, s. aureus, was the most susceptible bacteria, while p. aeruginosa showed, in general, least susceptibility. among the eight essential oils evaluated, thyme, oregano and pennyroyal oils showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, followed by rosemary, peppermint and verbena, while basil and mint showed the weakest antimicrobial activity. most of the essential oils considered in this study exhibited a significant inhibitory effect. thyme oil showed a promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, thus revealing its potential as a natural preservative in food products against several causal agents of foodborne diseases and food spoilage. in general, the results demonstrate that, besides flavoring the food, the use of aromatic herbs in gastronomy can also contribute to a bacteriostatic effect against pathogens.

TI  == bactericidal activity of methanol extracts of crabapple mangrove tree (sonneratia caseolaris linn.) against multi-drug resistant pathogens.
AB  == the crabapple mangrove tree, sonneratia caseolaris linn. (family: sonneratiaceae), is one of the foreshore plants found in estuarine and tidal creek areas and mangrove forests. bark and fruit extracts from this plant have previously been shown to have an anti-oxidative or cytotoxic effect, whereas flower extracts of this plant exhibited an antimicrobial activity against some bacteria. according to the traditional folklore, it is medicinally used as an astringent and antiseptic. hence, this investigation was carried out on the extract of the leaves, pneumatophore and different parts of the flower or fruit (stamen, calyx, meat of fruit, persistent calyx of fruit and seeds) for antibacterial activity using the broth microdilution method. the antibacterial activity was evaluated against five antibiotic-sensitive species (three gram-positive and two gram-negative bacteria) and six drug-resistant species (gram-positive i.e. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and gram-negative i.e. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-escherichia coli, multidrug-resistant-pseudomonas aeruginosa and acenetobacter baumannii). the methanol extracts from all tested parts of the crabapple mangrove tree exhibited antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, but was mainly a bactericidal against the gram-negative bacteria, including the multidrug-resistant strains, when compared with only bacteriostatic on the gram-positive bacteria. using soxhlet apparatus, the extracts obtained by sequential extraction with hexane, dichloromethane and ethyl acetate revealed no discernable antibacterial activity  and only slightly, if at all, reduced the antibacterial activity of the subsequently obtained methanol extract. therefore, the active antibacterial compounds of the crabapple mangrove tree should have a rather polar structure.

TI  == dietary plant phenolic improves survival of bacterial infection in manduca sexta  caterpillars.
AB  == plant phenolics are generally thought to play significant roles in plant defense  against herbivores and pathogens. many plant taxa, including solanaceae, are rich in phenolic compounds and some insect herbivores have been shown to acquire phenolics from their hosts to use them as protection against their natural enemies. here we demonstrate that larvae of an insect specialist on solanaceae, the tobacco hornworm, manduca sexta l. (lepidoptera: sphingidae), acquire the plant phenolic chlorogenic acid (ca), and other caffeic acid derivatives as they  feed on one of their hosts, nicotiana attenuata l. (solanaceae), and on artificial diet supplemented with ca. we test the hypothesis that larvae fed on ca-supplemented diet would have better resistance against bacterial infection than larvae fed on a standard ca-free diet by injecting bacteria into the hemocoel of fourth instars. larvae fed ca-supplemented diet show significantly higher survival of infection with enterococcus faecalis (andrewes & horder) schleifer & kilpper-balz, but not of infection with the more virulent pseudomonas aeruginosa (schroeter) migula. larvae fed on ca-supplemented diet possess a constitutively higher number of circulating hemocytes than larvae fed on the standard diet, but we found no other evidence of increased immune system activity, nor were larvae fed on ca-supplemented diet better able to suppress bacterial proliferation early in the infection. thus, our data suggest an additional defensive function of ca to the direct toxic inhibition of pathogen proliferation in the gut.

AB  == the increase of multidrug-resistant pathogens and the restriction on the use antibiotics due to its side effects have drawn attention to the search for possible alternatives. bacteriocins are small antimicrobial peptides produced by  numerous bacteria. much interest has been focused on bacteriocins because they exhibit inhibitory activity against pathogens. lactic acid bacteria possess the ability to synthesize antimicrobial compounds (like bacteriocin) during their growth. in this study, an antibacterial substance (bacteriocin pj4) produced by lactobacillus helveticus pj4, isolated from rat gut microflora, was identified as bacteriocin. it was effective against wide assay of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria involved in various diseases, including escherichia coli,  bacillus subtilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus. the antimicrobial peptide was relatively heat-resistant and also active over a wide ph range of 2-10. it has been partially purified to homogeneity using ammonium sulfate precipitation and size exclusion chromatography and checked on reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of bacteriocin pj4 purified through size exclusion chromatography resolved ~6.5 kda  protein with bacteriocin activity. the peptide is inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, trypsin, and lipase but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, and pepsin. it showed a bactericidal mode of action against the indicator strains e. coli mtcc443, lactobacillus casei mtcc1423, and e. faecalis dt48. such characteristics indicate that this bacteriocin may be a potential candidate for alternative agents to control important pathogens.

AB  == several japanese companies sell electrical devices advertised as effective in inactivating viruses and killing bacteria by releasing special materials, e.g., plasmacluster ions, nanoe particle and minus ions, into the air. these companies  claim that their devices killed bacteria on plates in their own experiments. we tested device effectiveness using the same experiments from the plasmacluster ioniser sharp co., japan, the nanoe generator panasonic co., japan, and the vion  king jim co., japan, to test their advertising claims. bactericidal ability on agar plate was tested, using staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis as follows: the medium containing a certain amount of each bacterium was put onto an agar plate and smeared. plates were kept in a closed chamber (inner volume 14.4 m3) or a glove box (inner volume 0.2 m), with one of the devices run for 2 hours. plates not exposed to any device were used as controls. each plate was retrieved and put in an incubator to count  the number of bacterial colonies formed on the plate. there was no significant difference in the number of colonies on plates exposed to devices compared to control, in the number for all devices, or in all bacteria tested in experiments  in the 14.4 m3 chamber. these results strongly suggest that these devices have almost no bactericidal effect, at least in space exceeding this volume. colony formation was suppressed in the glove box in all devices and in all bacteria tested except p. aeruginosa, although the degree of suppression differed among experiments. the colony formation suppression mechanism was analyzed, and indicated that:colony formation did not change even after the removal of plasmacluster ions, nanoe particles, or negative ions from the air, while colony  formation was decreased drastically by the removal of ozone from space, which was revealed to be generated inevitably during device operation. these results strongly suggest that the bactericidal effect seen only on the agar plate in narrow space was explained by ozone released in space as a by-product, not by special materials as advertising claimed. it is thus important to analyze the effect of special materials such as those done in this study and to suggest the involvement of ozone as the true cause, as have been done in this study, in evaluating bactericidal effect or viral inactivation as advertised by these companies.

TI  == chimeric beta-defensin analogs, including the novel 3ni analog, display salt-resistant antimicrobial activity and lack toxicity in human epithelial cell  lines.
AB  == human beta-defensins (hbds) are crucial peptides for the innate immune response and are thus prime candidates as therapeutic agents directed against infective diseases. based on the properties of wild-type hbd1 and hbd3 and of previously synthesized analogs (1c, 3i, and 3n), we have designed a new analog, 3ni, and investigated its potential as an antimicrobial drug. specifically, we evaluated the antimicrobial activities of 3ni versus those of hbd1, hbd3, 1c, 3i, and 3n. our results show that 3ni exerted greater antibacterial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecalis than did hbd1 and hbd3, even with elevated salt concentrations. moreover, its antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus 1 was greater than that of hbd1 and similar to that of hbd3. subsequently, we investigated the cytotoxic effects of all peptides in three human epithelial carcinoma cell lines: a549 from lung, caco-2 from colon, and capan-1 from pancreas. none of the analogs significantly reduced  cell viability versus wild-type hbd1 and hbd3. they did not induce genotoxicity or cause an increase in the number of apoptotic cells. using confocal microscopy, we also investigated the localization of the peptides during their incubation with epithelial cells and found that they were distributed on the cell surface, from which they were internalized. finally, we show that hbd1 and hbd3 are characterized by high resistance to serum degradation. in conclusion, the new analog 3ni seems to be a promising anti-infective agent, particularly given its high salt resistance--a feature that is relevant in diseases such as cystic fibrosis.

TI  == glucose triggers atp secretion from bacteria in a growth-phase-dependent manner.
AB  == atp modulates immune cell functions, and atp derived from gut commensal bacteria  promotes the differentiation of t helper 17 (th17) cells in the intestinal lamina propria. we recently reported that enterococcus gallinarum, isolated from mice and humans, secretes atp. we have since found and characterized several atp-secreting bacteria. of the tested enterococci, enterococcus mundtii secreted  the greatest amount of atp (>2 mum/10(8) cells) after overnight culture. glucose, not amino acids and vitamins, was essential for atp secretion from e. mundtii. analyses of energy-deprived cells demonstrated that glycolysis is the most important pathway for bacterial atp secretion. furthermore, exponential-phase e.  mundtii and enterococcus faecalis cells secrete atp more efficiently than stationary-phase cells. other bacteria, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus, also secrete atp in exponential but  not stationary phase. these results suggest that various gut bacteria, including  commensals and pathogens, might secrete atp at any growth phase and modulate immune cell function.

TI  == chemical composition and antioxidant/antimicrobial activities in supercritical carbon dioxide fluid extract of gloiopeltis tenax.
AB  == gloiopeltis tenax (g. tenax) is widely distributed along the chinese coastal areas and is commonly used in the treatment of diarrhea and colitis. this study aimed at investigating the bioactivities of the volatile constituents in g. tenax. we extracted the essential constituents of g. tenax by supercritical carbon dioxide extraction (co(2)-sfe), then identified and analyzed the constituents by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms). in total, 30 components were identified in the g. tenax extract. the components showed remarkable antioxidant activity (radical scavenging activity of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (dpph)), lipid peroxidation inhibition capacity (in a beta-carotene/linoleic acid-coupled oxidation reaction), and hydroxyl radical-scavenging activity (by deoxyribose degradation by iron-dependent hydroxyl radical), compared to butylated hydroxytoluene. in microdilution assays, g. tenax extracts showed a moderate inhibitory effects on staphyloccocus aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) = 3.9 mg/ml), enterococcus faecalis (7.8  mg/ml), pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.6 mg/ml), and escherichia coli (3.9 mg/ml). antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of g. tenax were related to the active chemical composition. these results suggest that the co(2)-sfe extract from g. tenax has potential to be used as a natural antioxidant and antimicrobial agent in food processing.

TI  == using rapid diagnostic tests to optimize antimicrobial selection in antimicrobial stewardship programs.
AB  == new advances in rapid diagnostic tests provide several collaborative opportunities for stewardship teams, particularly in processes where delay in the initiation of appropriate therapy has significant consequences for patient outcomes. rapid molecular tests enhance one of the key functions of microbiology  laboratories, which is to produce accurate organism identification and timely antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. these data are used to guide the choice of antimicrobial agents for treating infections in individual patients, and the aggregate data (i.e., hospital's antibiogram) are used to guide empiric therapy for infections before the availability of the patient's culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. in addition, accurate antimicrobial susceptibility testing data are critical for the overall success of a health care institution's antimicrobial stewardship program. tests that provide accurate organism identification and antimicrobial susceptibility not only benefit the individual patient but also increase the effectiveness of antimicrobial stewardship programs. this review focuses on the use of molecular diagnostic methods to rapidly identify staphylococcus species, enterococcus faecalis,enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli,klebsiella pneumoniae,pseudomonas aeruginosa,clostridium difficile, and candida species from clinical samples and summarizes studies that describe the application of rapid diagnostic tests in antimicrobial stewardship programs.

TI  == antibacterial and antimycotic activities of slovenian honeys.
AB  == in the present study, slovenian honey samples produced from different floral sources are evaluated for their antibacterial and antifungal properties. the peroxide contribution to antibacterial activity is also determined. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the honeys was assessed against four bacterial  species (escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus) and against eight fungal species (aspergillus niger, aureobasidium pullulans, candida albicans, candida parapsilosis, candida tropicalis, cladosporium cladosporioides, penicillium chrysogenum and rhodotorula mucilaginosa). honey at concentrations between 1% and 50% (v/v) were tested. although all of the bacterial species were inhibited by the different honey samples, the chestnut and pasture honeys showed the highest antibacterial activities. the antifungal activities were concentration-dependent, with five (aureobasidium pullulans, candida parapsilosis, candida tropicalis, cladosporium  cladosporioides, rhodotorula mucilaginosa) inhibited only at honey concentrations greater than 50%. the fungi aspergillus niger, candida albicans and penicillium chrysogenum were not inhibited by any of the tested honeys, even at the highest concentrations. the lowest mics seen were 2.5% (v/v) for the chestnut, fir and forest honeys against staphylococcus aureus, and 10.0% (v/v) for the chestnut and pasture honeys against cladosporium cladosporioides. the non-peroxide action of chestnut honey was tested against escherichia coli. the mic of the catalase-treated chestnut honey was 50% (v/v). the antibacterial effect of slovenian honeys is mostly due to peroxide action. these data support the concept that slovenian honeys are effective antibacterials and antifungals, and can thus  be applied for medicinal purposes.

TI  == the insect galleria mellonella as a powerful infection model to investigate bacterial pathogenesis.
AB  == the study of bacterial virulence often requires a suitable animal model. mammalian models of infection are costly and may raise ethical issues. the use of insects as infection models provides a valuable alternative. compared to other non-vertebrate model hosts such as nematodes, insects have a relatively advanced  system of antimicrobial defenses and are thus more likely to produce information  relevant to the mammalian infection process. like mammals, insects possess a complex innate immune system(1). cells in the hemolymph are capable of phagocytosing or encapsulating microbial invaders, and humoral responses include  the inducible production of lysozyme and small antibacterial peptides(2,3). in addition, analogies are found between the epithelial cells of insect larval midguts and intestinal cells of mammalian digestive systems. finally, several basic components essential for the bacterial infection process such as cell adhesion, resistance to antimicrobial peptides, tissue degradation and adaptation to oxidative stress are likely to be important in both insects and mammals(1). thus, insects are polyvalent tools for the identification and characterization of microbial virulence factors involved in mammalian infections. larvae of the greater wax moth galleria mellonella have been shown to provide a useful insight  into the pathogenesis of a wide range of microbial infections including mammalian fungal (fusarium oxysporum, aspergillus fumigatus, candida albicans) and bacterial pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris, serratia marcescens pseudomonas aeruginosa, listeria monocytogenes or enterococcus faecalis(4-7). regardless of the bacterial species, results obtained with galleria larvae infected by direct injection through the cuticle consistently correlate with those of similar mammalian studies: bacterial strains that are attenuated in mammalian models demonstrate lower virulence in galleria, and strains causing severe human infections are also highly virulent in the galleria  model(8-11). oral infection of galleria is much less used and additional compounds, like specific toxins, are needed to reach mortality. g. mellonella larvae present several technical advantages: they are relatively large (last instar larvae before pupation are about 2 cm long and weight 250 mg), thus enabling the injection of defined doses of bacteria; they can be reared at various temperatures (20 degrees c to 30 degrees c) and infection studies can be  conducted between 15 degrees c to above 37 degrees c(12,13), allowing experiments that mimic a mammalian environment. in addition, insect rearing is easy and relatively cheap. infection of the larvae allows monitoring bacterial virulence by several means, including calculation of ld50(14), measurement of bacterial survival(15,16) and examination of the infection process(17). here, we describe the rearing of the insects, covering all life stages of g. mellonella. we provide a detailed protocol of infection by two routes of inoculation: oral and intra haemocoelic. the bacterial model used in this protocol is bacillus cereus, a gram positive pathogen implicated in gastrointestinal as well as in other severe local or systemic opportunistic infections(18,19).

TI  == effect of low-dose gaseous ozone on pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: treatment of chronically infected wounds is a challenge, and bacterial environmental contamination is a growing issue in infection control. ozone may have a role in these situations. the objective of this study was to determine whether a low dose of gaseous ozone/oxygen mixture eliminates pathogenic bacteria cultivated in petri dishes. methods: a pilot study with 6 bacterial strains was made using different concentrations of ozone in an ozone-oxygen mixture to determine a minimally effective dose that completely eliminated bacterial growth. the small and apparently bactericidal gaseous dose of 20 mug/ml ozone/oxygen (1:99) mixture, applied for 5 min under atmospheric pressure was selected. in the 2nd phase, eight bacterial strains with well characterized resistance patterns were evaluated in vitro using agar-blood in adapted petri dishes (105 bacteria/dish). the cultures were divided into 3 groups: 1--ozone-oxygen gaseous mixture containing 20 mug of o(3)/ml for 5 min; 2--100% oxygen for 5 min; 3--baseline: no gas was used. results: the selected ozone dose was applied to the following eight strains: escherichia coli, oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae, carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter baumannii susceptible only to carbapenems, and pseudomonas aeruginosa susceptible to imipenem and meropenem. all isolates were completely inhibited by the ozone-oxygen mixture while growth occurred in the other 2 groups. conclusion: a single topical application by nebulization of a low ozone dose completely inhibited the growth of all potentially pathogenic bacterial strains with known resistance to antimicrobial agents.

TI  == tissue distribution, expression, and antimicrobial activity of anas platyrhynchos avian beta-defensin 6.
AB  == in this study, a novel avian beta-defensin (avbd) was isolated from the chaohu duck. the complete nucleotide sequence of the gene contained a 204-bp open reading frame that encoded 67 amino acids (aa), including a signal peptide of 20  aa, a propiece of 5 aa, and a mature peptide of 42 aa. the homology, characterization, and comparison of this gene with avbd from other avian species  confirmed that it was duck avbd6. also, the preproprotein of avbd6 from chicken,  goose, and duck was highly conserved with 100% aa homology. the avbd6 mrna was widely expressed in the investigated tissues of healthy 5-mo-old ducks, with the  exception of the skin, kidney, and bursa. the avbd6 mrna was highly expressed in  the spleen, lung, stomach, tongue, and egg yolk, successively; moderately expressed in the bone marrow and liver; and expressed to lower degrees in the trachea, heart, intestine, muscle, esophagus, and testis. we produced recombinant avbd6 by expressing the gene in escherichia coli. the yield of soluble glutathione s-transferees (gst)-avbd6 in the inclusion bodies increased significantly as the incubation temperature was decreased from 37 to 30 degrees c. as expected, the gst-avbd6 exhibited strong bactericidal properties [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) = 0.5 to 2 mum] against the aeromonas veronii biovar sobria strain bjcp-5, e. coli, and enterococcus faecalis [atcc 29212); it  possessed medium bactericidal properties (mic = 4 to 8 mum) against staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enteritidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853), and bacillus subtilis (cmcc 63501;; and it possessed low bactericidal properties (mic = 16 mum) against candida albicans (atcc 10231). additionally, the antimicrobial activity of gst-avbd6 proved to be the same as that of synthetic avbd6. the a. veronii biovar sobria strain bjcp-5 cells that were treated with gst-avbd6 showed lysis and shrinkage under scanning electron microscopy. the mechanisms of avbd6-mediated killing of a. veronii biovar sobria  involved both cell lysis and nonlysis. our results indicate that avbd6 plays an important role in the innate immunity of the chaohu duck.

TI  == association with soil bacteria enhances p38-dependent infection resistance in caenorhabditis elegans.
AB  == the importance of our inner microbial communities for proper immune responses against invading pathogens is now well accepted, but the mechanisms underlying this protection are largely unknown. in this study, we used caenorhabditis elegans to investigate such mechanisms. since very little is known about the microbes interacting with c. elegans in its natural environment, we began by taking the first steps to characterize the c. elegans microbiota. we established  a natural-like environment in which initially germfree, wild-type larvae were grown on enriched soil. bacterial members of the adult c. elegans microbiota were isolated by culture and identified using 16s rrna gene sequencing. using pure cultures of bacterial isolates as food, we identified two, bacillus megaterium and pseudomonas mendocina, that enhanced resistance to a subsequent infection with the gram-negative pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa. whereas protection by b.  megaterium was linked to impaired egg laying, corresponding to a known trade-off  between fecundity and resistance, the mechanism underlying protection conferred by p. mendocina depended on weak induction of immune genes regulated by the p38 mapk pathway. disruption of the p38 ortholog, pmk-1, abolished protection. p. mendocina enhanced resistance to p. aeruginosa but not to the gram-positive pathogen enterococcus faecalis. furthermore, protection from p. aeruginosa was similarly induced by a p. aeruginosa gaca mutant with attenuated virulence but not by a different c. elegans-associated pseudomonas sp. isolate. our results support a pivotal role for the conserved p38 pathway in microbiota-initiated immune protection and suggest that similarity between microbiota members and pathogens may play a role in such protection.

AB  == immunocompromised hosts are at high risk for bloodstream infections (bsis); the outcome is unpredictable (even with adequate therapy), frequently severe (mortality 27%). a 26 months survey in a haematology/oncology hospital was set-up; it comprised 158 patients and detected 171 positive blood cultures. the origin of the infections was primitive in 27.22% and secondary in 72.78% of the cases; the most frequent cause was the presence of a vascular catheter (23.41%).  the second most important cause were the respiratory infections (19.62%), followed by the urinary tract infections (utis) (11.39%). gram negative bacilli represented 59.4%, the enterobacteriaceae were predominant (35.59%), followed by  pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.73%) and species like serratia marcescens and acinetobacter baumannii. although isolated at low level, they worry by an increasing frequency. among gram positive cocci (43.51%) coagulase negative staphylococci (cons) were the most frequent (25.42%), followed by staphylococcus  aureus (18.08%); enterococcus faecalis (5.65%) was isolated from polymicrobial (associated) infections. the strains of e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa  were constantly susceptible to carbapenems, demonstrating otherwise various susceptibility patterns, generally elevated to the antibiotics we tested. the production of extended spectrum betalactamase (esbl) was 22.58%. the methicillin  resistance was 54.4% in s. aureus strains; the susceptibility was variable among  7 other antibiotics tested. one staphylococcus strain had reduced susceptibility  to vancomycin. a multidisciplinary survey is necessary for the control of the multidrug resistant organisms (mdro).

TI  == clinical identification of bacteria in human chronic wound infections: culturing  vs. 16s ribosomal dna sequencing.
AB  == background: chronic wounds affect millions of people and cost billions of dollars in the united states each year. these wounds harbor polymicrobial biofilm communities, which can be difficult to elucidate using culturing methods. clinical molecular microbiological methods are increasingly being employed to investigate the microbiota of chronic infections, including wounds, as part of standard patient care. however, molecular testing is more sensitive than culturing, which results in markedly different results being reported to clinicians. this study compares the results of aerobic culturing and molecular testing (culture-free 16s ribosomal dna sequencing), and it examines the relative abundance score that is generated by the molecular test and the usefulness of the relative abundance score in predicting the likelihood that the same organism would be detected by culture. methods: parallel samples from 51 chronic wounds were studied using aerobic culturing and 16s dna sequencing for the identification of bacteria. results: one hundred forty-five (145) unique genera were identified using molecular methods, and 68 of these genera were aerotolerant. fourteen (14) unique genera were identified using aerobic culture methods. one-third (31/92) of the cultures were determined to be < 1% of the relative abundance of the wound microbiota using molecular testing. at the genus  level, molecular testing identified 85% (78/92) of the bacteria that were identified by culture. conversely, culturing detected 15.7% (78/497) of the aerotolerant bacteria and detected 54.9% of the collective aerotolerant relative  abundance of the samples. aerotolerant bacterial genera (and individual species including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococcus faecalis) with higher relative abundance scores were more likely to be detected by culture as demonstrated with regression modeling. conclusion: discordance between molecular and culture testing is often observed. however, culture-free 16s ribosomal dna sequencing and its relative abundance score can provide clinicians with insight into which bacteria are most abundant in a sample and which are most likely to be detected by culture.

(or 18.39, 95% ci 2.32-145.2) and enterococcus faecalis (or 10.7, 95% ci 1.27-89.9) showed a significant relationship with intrauterine inflammation processes. e. faecalis increased the risk for nec (or 6.13, 95% ci 1.059-37.6). we did not note a link between rop and genital tract colonisation. interestingly pda seems to be triggered by the presence of pseudomonas aeruginosa (or 2.38 95% ci 1.83-3.82). conclusion: our results show a link between k. pneumoniae, staphylococcus sp., e. faecalis and intrauterine infection. e. faecalis increases the risk for nec, and suggests a direct link between gram + bacteria, chorioamnionitis and nec.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == prevention of initial biofilm formation on ureteral stents using a sustained releasing varnish containing chlorhexidine: in vitro study.
AB  == background and purpose: ureteral stents are being used exceedingly in the field of urology, and with advancements in endourology, this trend is increasing. bacterial colonization and proliferation on the stent surface may result in urinary tract infections (utis) necessitating the administration of antibiotics that, in turn, may lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. several studies have shown that sustained release varnish (srv) combined with antibiotics or antiseptics can prevent the proliferation of bacteria on urethral catheters. this is the first study that evaluates this technique implemented on ureteral stents. materials and methods: we evaluated growth inhibition on ureteral stent segments coated with chlorhexidine (chx) 1% srv. the tests were conducted using common urinary pathogens: enterococci, pseudomonas, and escherichia coli. coated stent segments were inserted into bacterial suspensions. controls included uncoated stent segments and stents coated with placebo srv (without chx). results: bacterial growth measured as turbidity and as colony-forming units showed a significant inhibition effect of initial bacteria adhesion to the chx-srv coated stent segments compared with the controls (p<0.001). this inhibitory effect was apparent in each of the bacteria tested and was confirmed by inspection of the stent segments under an electron microscope. in a kinetic experiment using chx 2% srv, we were able to prolong the growth inhibition effect from 1 week to nearly 2 weeks. conclusions: we believe this technique may play a significant role in reducing ureteral stent-associated utis. further studies are needed before this approach can be implemented in clinical practice.

AB  == the aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, salmonella enterica ser. enteritidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. the tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. in the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the ph values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. the inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. phosphates obviously made the development of most gram-positive bacteria impossible. especially micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. on the other  hand, gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. the exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. it should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates hexa68 and hexa70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. by comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be  concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on ph values.

TI  == the antimicrobial, antioxidative, anti-inflammatory activity and cytotoxicity of  different fractions of four south african bauhinia species used traditionally to  treat diarrhoea.
AB  == ethnopharmacological importance: many bauhinia species, including those indigenous to south africa, are used in traditional medicine across the world for treating ailments such as gastrointestinal tract (git) disorders, diabetes, infectious diseases and inflammation. aims: several relevant aspects of different fractions of leaf extracts of bauhinia bowkeri (bab), bauhinia galpinii (bag), bauhinia petersiana (bap), and bauhinia variegata (bav) used in south african traditional medicine to alleviate diarrhoea related symptoms were evaluated. materials and methods: the antioxidative activities of the extracts were determined using the 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (dpph), 2, 2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (abts(+)) radical scavenging and ferric  reducing antioxidant power (frap) methods. in vitro antimicrobial activities of the extracts were determined against bacterial strains (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis) and clinical  isolates of the opportunistic fungal strains (aspergillus fumigatus, candida albicans, and cryptococcus neoformans) using a serial dilution microplate method. the polyphenolic contents were quantified using standard methods, and anti-inflammatory activities of the crude extracts were determined using the cyclooxygenase and soybean 15-lipoxygenase enzyme inhibitory assays. the safety of the extracts was evaluated by determining the cytotoxicity against vero cell lines. results: the acidified 70% acetone crude extract and their fractions had good antiradical potency against the dpph and abts radicals. the methanol soluble portions of the butanol fractions were more potent (ec(50) ranges from 0.64 +/- 0.05 to 1.51 +/- 0.07 and 0.88 +/- 0.18 to 1.49 +/- 0.09 mug/ml against dpph and  abts radical respectively) compared to the standard, trolox and ascorbic acid (ec(50) ranges from 1.47 +/- 0.24 to 1.70 +/- 0.27 mug/ml) for both dpph and abts. the crude extracts contained variable quantities of phenolic content. the crude extracts and their fractions had weak to good antimicrobial activities, inhibiting the growth of the organisms at concentrations ranging from 39 to 2500  mug/ml. the bag crude extract and its fractions were the most active against the  fungi (mics ranging from 39 to 625 mug/ml) while the bab extract and its fractions were the least active with the mics ranging between 39 and 2500 mug/ml. aspergillus fumigatus was the least susceptible fungus while cryptococcus neoformans was the most susceptible. the phenolic-rich crude extracts of bab, bag, and bap had moderate to good dose-dependent cyclooxygenase-1 enzyme inhibitory activity with inhibitions between 22.8% and 71.4%. the extracts were however, inactive against cyclooxygenase-2. the extracts had some level of cytotoxicity towards vero cell lines, reducing cell viability to less than 10% at concentrations more than 50 mug/ml. conclusion: the biological activities observed in bauhinia species provide a scientific basis for the use of the plants in traditional medicines to treat diseases with multi-factorial pathogenesis such as diarrhoea, with each aspect of activity contributing to the ultimate therapeutic benefit of the plants. however, the use of the phenolic-rich extracts of these plants to treat diarrhoea or any other ailments in traditional medicine  needs to be monitored closely because of potential toxic effects and selective inhibition of cox-1 with the associated git injury.

TI  == the influences of natural zeolite (cliptinolite) on ammonia and biogenic amine formation by foodborne pathogen.
AB  == the influence of natural zeolite on biogenic amines (bas) and ammonia (amn) production by eight common gram negative and positive foodborne pathogens (fbp) were investigated in histidine decarboxylase broth (hdb). presence of 1% zeolite  in the hdb resulted in significantly higher amn production. histamine (his) production by gram positive bacteria was as low as 0.5 mg/l, whereas escherichia  coli produced 18.96 mg/l of his. the use of zeolite also significantly suppressed his accumulation by e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, s. paratyphi a (p < 0.05), although zeolite addition stimulated his production by k. pneumonia and aeromonas hydrophila. the range of tyramine (tyr) production by gram positive bacteria was  1.19 and 4.06 mg/l for enteroccus faecalis and listeria monocytogenes respectively. the results of study showed that the effect of zeolite on bas and amn production was dependent on bacterial strains, as well as zeolite concentrations used. practical application: natural zeolites are the main absorptive, low-cost material used in agriculture and industry. although the effect of zeolite on ammonia formation in some industrial systems is well known,  there is limited information regarding the impact of zeolite on biogenic amine (ba) production by foodborne pathogens. the data presented in this article will help us to understand the impact of natural zeolite on ba and ammonia production  by eight common foodborne pathogens.

TI  == rapid identification of eskape bacterial strains using an autonomous microfluidic device.
AB  == this article describes bacteria id chips ('bacchips'): an inexpensive, portable,  and autonomous microfluidic platform for identifying pathogenic strains of bacteria. bacchips consist of a set of microchambers and channels molded in the elastomeric polymer, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (pdms). each microchamber is preloaded with mono-, di-, or trisaccharides and dried. pressing the layer of pdms into contact with a glass coverslip forms the device; the footprint of the device in this article is approximately 6 cm(2). after assembly, bacchips are degased under large negative pressure and are stored in vacuum-sealed plastic bags. to use the device, the bag is opened, a sample containing bacteria is introduced at the inlet of the device, and the degased pdms draws the sample into the central channel and chambers. after the liquid at the inlet is consumed, air  is drawn into the bacchip via the inlet and provides a physical barrier that separates the liquid samples in adjacent microchambers. a ph indicator is admixed with the samples prior to their loading, enabling the metabolism of the dissolved saccharides in the microchambers to be visualized. importantly, bacchips operate  without external equipment or instruments. by visually detecting the growth of bacteria using ambient light after approximately 4 h, we demonstrate that bacchips with ten microchambers containing different saccharides can reproducibly detect the eskape panel of pathogens, including strains of: enterococcus faecalis, enteroccocus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae. this article describes a bacchip for point-of-care detection of eskape pathogens and a starting point for designing multiplexed assays that identify bacterial strains from clinical samples and simultaneously determine their susceptibility to antibiotics.

TI  == composition and antimicrobial activity of fatty acids detected in the hygroscopic secretion collected from the secretory setae of larvae of the biting midge forcipomyia nigra (diptera: ceratopogonidae).
AB  == the hygroscopic secretion produced by the secretory setae of terrestrial larvae of the biting midge forcipomyia nigra (winnertz) was analysed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (gc-ms). the viscous secretion is stored at the top of each seta and absorbs water from moist air. gc-ms analyses (four independent tests) showed that the secretion contained 12 free fatty acids, the most abundant of which were oleic (18:1), palmitic (16:0), palmitoleic (16:1) and linoleic (18:2). other acids identified were valeric (5:0), enanthic (7:0), caprylic (8:0), pelargonic (9:0), capric (10:0), lauric (12:0), myristic (14:0) and stearic (18:0). two other compounds, glycerol and pyroglutamic acid, were also found. the antibacterial activity of the fatty acids and pyroglutamic acid was tested using the agar disc diffusion method and targeted gram positive (bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis) and gram negative bacterial strains (citrobacter freundii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens). the antifungal activity was tested by determining minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of examined compounds. fatty acids were tested against enthomopathogenic fungi (paecilomyces lilacinus, paecilomyces fumosoroseus, lecanicillium lecanii, metarhizium anisopliae, beauveria bassiana (tve-n39), beauveria bassiana (dv-1/07)). the most effective acids against bacterial and fungal growth were c(9:0), c(10:0) and c(16:1), whereas c(14:0), c(16:0,) c(18:0) and c(18:1) demonstrated rather poor antifungal activity and did not inhibit the growth of bacteria. the antimicrobial assay investigated mixtures of fatty and pyroglutamic acids (corresponding to the results of each gc-ms test): they were found to be active against almost all the bacteria except p. fluorescens and also demonstrated certain fungistatic activity against enthomopathogenic fungi. the hygroscopic secretion facilitates cuticular respiration and plays an important role in the antimicrobial protection of f. nigra larvae living in moist terrestrial habitats.

TI  == [analysis of distribution characteristics and drug resistance of 2748 strains of  pathogens isolated from burn patients].
AB  == objective: to provide epidemiological data of the distribution characteristics and drug resistance of the pathogens isolated from burn patients in recent years  for guiding rational use of antibiotics in clinic. methods: totally 2748 strains  of pathogens were isolated from 1977 specimens (blood, catheter, wound excretion, etc.) collected from 478 patients hospitalized in institute of burn research of southwest hospital from march 2003 to june 2011. after being identified by api strips, drug resistance of the 2748 isolated pathogens to 55 commonly-used antibiotics including gentamicin, tobramycin, piperacillin, amikacin, etc. was tested by k-b paper disk diffusion method. the whonet 5.3 software was used to analyze the following subjects: the distribution of the pathogens with different  types and different sources each year, the changes in drug-resistant rates of gram negative bacilli, gram positive cocci, and fungi to several antibiotics, and the changes in sensitive rates of pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa), staphylococcus aureus (sa), acinetobacter baumannii (ab), candida albicans (ca) to several antibiotics. results: among 2748 strains of pathogens, 1879 strains of gram negative bacilli accounted for 68.38%, 628 strains of gram positive cocci accounted for 22.85%, and 241 strains of fungi accounted for 8.77%. the isolation rate of strains from wound excretion ranked the first (1022 strains accounted for 37.19%), followed by those from respiratory tract (995 strains accounted for 36.21%) and blood (421 strains accounted for 15.32%). strains isolated from other types of specimens were rare. isolation rate of pa ranked the first (996 strains  accounted for 36.24%), followed by sa (495 strains accounted for 18.01%) and ab (395 strains accounted for 14.37%). isolation rate of ab showed a trend of increase year by year, but that of sa presented the opposite trend. isolation rate of pa was quite stable. there were 484 strains of methicillin resistant sa among staphylococci, accounting for 17.61%. resistant rates of pa and ab to polymyxin b and polymyxin e were below 30.00%, and those of pa and ab to other antibiotics, such as the third generation cephalosporins, beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and quinolones, were from 57.91% to 100.00%. resistant rate of ab to minocycline was 39.68%. from 2004 to 2011, sensitive rate of pa to quinolone antibiotics showed an increasing trend year by year, but that of ab to  minocycline, netilmicin, imipenem, meropenem, tobramycin, and cefoperazone/sulbactam presented the opposite trend. resistant rates of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and sa to teicoplanin and linezolid  were less than 10.00%. resistant rate of sa, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecium to vancomycin was 0. resistant rates of sa to quinupristin/dalfopristin, minocycline, fusidic acid, and compound sulfamethoxazole were low, respectively 0.82%, 9.35%, 2.21%, and 31.85%. sensitive rates of sa to erythromycin, clindamycin, compound sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and minocycline showed an increasing trend year by year. both infection rate and resistant rate of fungi were low. the resistant rates of ca to 5 kinds of antibiotics were less than 15.00%. the sensitive rate of ca to 5-flucytosine declined slightly, and those of ca to the other 4 antibiotics showed an increasing trend year by year. conclusions: the three dominant pathogens that cause infection in burn patients hospitalized in institute of burn research of southwest hospital in recent years are pa, sa, and ab in order. pa and ab are outstandingly multidrug-resistant among the isolated strains. ab might replace pa as the main pathogenic bacterium that cause the death of burn patients with infection.

TI  == type i and type ii mechanisms of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy: an in vitro  study on gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background and objectives: antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) employs a non-toxic photosensitizer (ps) and visible light, which in the presence of oxygen produce reactive oxygen species (ros), such as singlet oxygen ((1) o(2), produced via type ii mechanism) and hydroxyl radical (ho(.), produced via type i mechanism). this study examined the relative contributions of (1) o(2) and ho(.)  to apdt killing of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. study design/materials and methods: fluorescence probes, 3'-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-fluorescein (hpf) and singlet oxygen sensor green reagent (sosg) were used to determine ho(.) and (1) o(2) produced by illumination of two  ps: tris-cationic-buckminsterfullerene (bb6) and a conjugate between polyethylenimine and chlorin(e6) (pei-ce6). dimethylthiourea is a ho(.) scavenger, while sodium azide (nan(3)) is a quencher of (1) o(2). both apdt and killing by fenton reaction (chemical generation of ho(.)) were carried out on gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). results: conjugate pei-ce6 mainly produced (1) o(2) (quenched by nan(3)), while bb6 produced ho(.) in addition to (1) o(2) when nan(3) potentiated probe activation. nan(3) also potentiated hpf activation by fenton reagent. all bacteria were killed by fenton reagent but gram-positive bacteria needed a higher concentration than gram-negatives. nan(3) potentiated fenton-mediated killing of  all bacteria. the ratio of apdt killing between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was 2 or 4:1 for bb6 and 25:1 for conjugate pei-ce6. there was a nan(3)  dose-dependent inhibition of apdt killing using both pei-ce6 and bb6 against gram-negative bacteria while nan(3) almost failed to inhibit killing of gram-positive bacteria. conclusion: azidyl radicals may be formed from nan(3) and ho(.). it may be that gram-negative bacteria are more susceptible to ho(.) while  gram-positive bacteria are more susceptible to (1) o(2). the differences in nan(3) inhibition may reflect differences in the extent of ps binding to bacteria (microenvironment) or differences in penetration of nan(3) into cell walls of bacteria.

AB  == rubus parvifolius l. (rp) is a medicinal herb that possesses antibacterial activity. in this study, we extracted the volatile oil from the leaves of rp to assess its antibacterial activity and analyze its chemical composition. a uniform distribution design was used to optimize the extraction procedure, which yielded  0.36% (w/w) of light yellowish oil from the water extract of rp leaves. we found  that the extracted oil effectively inhibited the growth of a wide range of gram positive and negative bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumanii, bacillus cloacae, and klebsiella pneumoniae. we further analyzed the components contained in the hydro-distillated rp volatile oil by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. twenty nine compounds were identified, including 4-hydroxy-3-methoxystyrene (66%), 3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-ol (10%) and 4-tert-butylbenzoic acid (2%). our results suggest that one or multiple constituents contained in rp volatile oil may account for its antibacterial activity.

AB  == objective: we compared differences in the hospital charges, length of hospital stay, and mortality between patients with healthcare- and community-associated bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, and pneumonia due to antimicrobial-resistant versus -susceptible bacterial strains. methods: a retrospective analysis of an electronic database compiled from laboratory, pharmacy, surgery, financial, and patient location and device utilization sources was undertaken on 5699 inpatients who developed healthcare- or community-associated infections between 2006 and 2008 from 4 hospitals (1 community, 1 pediatric, 2 tertiary/quaternary care) in manhattan. the main outcome measures were hospital charges, length of stay, and mortality among patients with antimicrobial-resistant and -susceptible infections caused by staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii. results: controlling for multiple confounders using linear regression and nearest neighbor matching based on propensity score estimates, resistant healthcare- and community-associated infections, when compared with susceptible strains of the same organism, were associated with significantly higher charges ($15,626; confidence interval [ci], $4339-$26,913 and $25,573; ci, $9331-$41,816, respectively) and longer hospital stays for community-associated infections (3.3; ci, 1.5-5.4). patients with resistant healthcare-associated infections also had a significantly higher death rate (0.04; ci, 0.01-0.08). conclusions: with careful  matching of patients infected with the same organism, antimicrobial resistance was associated with higher charges, length of stay, and death rates. the difference in estimates after accounting for censoring for death highlight divergent social and hospital incentives in reducing patient risk for antimicrobial resistant infections.

TI  == comparison of the wst-8 colorimetric method and the clsi broth microdilution method for susceptibility testing against drug-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) obtained from the susceptibility testing of various bacteria to antibiotics were determined by a colorimetric microbial viability assay based on reduction of a tetrazolium salt {2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2h-tetrazoli um, monosodium salt (wst-8)} via 2-methyl-1,4-napthoquinone as an electron mediator and compared with those obtained by the broth microdilution methods approved by the clinical and laboratory standard institute (clsi). especially for drug-resistant bacteria, the clsi method at an incubation time of 24h tended to give lower mics. the extension of incubation time was necessary to obtain consistent mics for drug-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococi (vre) and multi-drug resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa (mdrp) in the broth microdilution method. there was excellent agreement between the mics determined after 24h using the wst-8 colorimetric method and those obtained after 48-96 h using the broth microdilution method. the results suggest that the wst-8 colorimetric assay is a  useful method for rapid determination of consistent mics for drug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == the antimicrobial activity of the appetite peptide hormone ghrelin.
AB  == the present study examined the antimicrobial activity of the peptide ghrelin. both major forms of ghrelin, acylated ghrelin (ag) and desacylated ghrelin (dag), demonstrated the same degree of bactericidal activity against gram-negative escherichia coli (e. coli) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), while bactericidal effects against gram-positive staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and  enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis) were minimal or absent, respectively. to elucidate the bactericidal mechanism of ag and dag against bacteria, we monitored the effect of the cationic peptides on the zeta potential of e. coli. our results show that ag and dag similarly quenched the negative surface charge of e. coli, suggesting that ghrelin-mediated bactericidal effects are influenced by charge-dependent binding and not by acyl modification. like most cationic antimicrobial peptides (camps), we also found that the antibacterial activity of  ag was attenuated in physiological nacl concentration (150mm). nonetheless, these findings indicate that both ag and dag can act as camps against gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == background: wound healing is a complex proces, which is influenced by multiple factors. bacterial contamination and infection are frequent and severe complications. the treatment of such infected wounds is a major challenge to the  plastic surgeon. the topical application of wound antiseptics is widely used as a therapeutic approach in the treatment of these wounds. this review provides an overview about their clinical application, their cytotoxic and antibacterial properties as well as interactions with commonly used wound dressings. material and methods: this article reviews current literature dealing with local antiseptics, antibacterial activity, cytotoxicity and compatibility with wound dressings. results: topical antiseptics are used on a daily basis in order to reduce bacterial wound contamination. however, few data exist concerning their antimicrobial activity, especially in relation to their cytotoxicity. furthermore, their compatibility with wound dressings is barely investigated. recent studies show significant toxic effects on cells and an incompatibility with certain wound dressings for some of these antiseptics. discussion: antiseptics are broadly used in healthcare to reduce, inactivate or eliminate bacterial pathogens. recent studies show that many daily used antiseptics possess relevant cytotoxic properties as well as cross reactions with wound dressings. additional studies are therefore needed to further investigate and characterize the properties of wound antiseptics in order to identify the optimal therapeutic  agents for the treatment of infected wounds.

AB  == although the immune response of caenorhabditis elegans to microbial infections is well established, very little is known about the effects of health-promoting probiotic bacteria on evolutionarily conserved c. elegans host responses. we found that the probiotic gram-positive bacterium lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm is not harmful to c. elegans and that l. acidophilus ncfm is unable to colonize the c. elegans intestine. conditioning with l. acidophilus ncfm significantly decreased the burden of a subsequent enterococcus faecalis infection in the nematode intestine and prolonged the survival of nematodes exposed to pathogenic  strains of e. faecalis and staphylococcus aureus, including multidrug-resistant (mdr) isolates. preexposure of nematodes to bacillus subtilis did not provide any beneficial effects. importantly, l. acidophilus ncfm activates key immune signaling pathways involved in c. elegans defenses against gram-positive bacteria, including the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (via tir-1 and pmk-1) and the beta-catenin signaling pathway (via bar-1). interestingly, conditioning with l. acidophilus ncfm had a minimal effect on gram-negative infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa or salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium  and had no or a negative effect on defense genes associated with gram-negative pathogens or general stress. in conclusion, we describe a new system for the study of probiotic immune agents and our findings demonstrate that probiotic conditioning with l. acidophilus ncfm modulates specific c. elegans immunity traits.

TI  == a role for skn-1/nrf in pathogen resistance and immunosenescence in caenorhabditis elegans.
AB  == a proper immune response ensures survival in a hostile environment and promotes longevity. recent evidence indicates that innate immunity, beyond antimicrobial effectors, also relies on host-defensive mechanisms. the caenorhabditis elegans transcription factor skn-1 regulates xenobiotic and oxidative stress responses and contributes to longevity, however, its role in immune defense is unknown. here we show that skn-1 is required for c. elegans pathogen resistance against both gram-negative pseudomonas aeruginosa and gram-positive enterococcus faecalis bacteria. exposure to p. aeruginosa leads to skn-1 accumulation in intestinal nuclei and transcriptional activation of two skn-1 target genes, gcs-1 and gst-4. both the toll/il-1 receptor domain protein tir-1 and the p38 mapk pmk-1 are required for skn-1 activation by pa14 exposure. we demonstrate an early onset of  immunosenescence with a concomitant age-dependent decline in skn-1-dependent target gene activation, and a requirement of skn-1 to enhance pathogen resistance in response to longevity-promoting interventions, such as reduced insulin/igf-like signaling and preconditioning h(2)o(2) treatment. finally, we find that wdr-23(rnai)-mediated constitutive skn-1 activation results in excessive transcription of target genes, confers oxidative stress tolerance, but  impairs pathogen resistance. our findings identify skn-1 as a novel regulator of  innate immunity, suggests its involvement in immunosenescence and provide an important crosstalk between pathogenic stress signaling and the xenobiotic/oxidative stress response.

TI  == first study on antimicriobial activity and synergy between isothiocyanates and antibiotics against selected gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria  from clinical and animal source.
AB  == the emergence of new diseases and the resurgence of several infections that were  controlled in the past, associated with recent increase of bacterial resistance have created the necessity for more studies towards to the development of new antimicrobials and new treatment strategies. the aim of the present study was to  evaluate the in vitro synergy between different classes of important glucosinolates hydrolysis products-isothiocyanates with antibiotics (gentamycin and vancomycin), against important pathogenic bacteria: escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. a disc diffusion method was used to evaluate the antibacterial activity. the antimicrobial activity of phytochemicals and combinations between gentamycin, vancomycin and phytochemicals were quantitatively assessed by measuring the inhibitory halos. the results showed a selective antimicrobial effect of isothiocyanates, and this effect was strictly related with their chemical structure. in general the benzylisothiocyanate was the most effective compound against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus were the bacteria  most affected either by the phytochemicals alone or by the combination phytochemical-antibiotic. the bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa was the less affected pathogen. the most important synergism detected occurred between the commercial antibiotics with benzylisothiocyanate and 2-phenylethylisothiocyanate. in conclusion, some isothiocyanates are effective inhibitors of in vitro bacterial growth, and they can act synergistically with antibiotics.

TI  == lif reduces mics of antibiotics against clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == antibiotic resistance is an ever-growing problem yet the development of new antibiotics has slowed to a trickle, giving rise to the use of combination therapy to eradicate infections. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the combined inhibitory effect of lithium fluoride (lif) and commonly used antimicrobials on the growth of the following bacteria: enterococcus faecalis, staphyloccoccus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and streptococcus pneumoniae. the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, streptomycin, erythromycin, amoxicillin, and ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, alone or combined with lif were performed by microdilution method. mics were determined visually following 18-20 h of incubation at 37 degrees c. we observed reduced mics of antibiotics associated with lif ranging from two-fold to sixteen-fold. the strongest decreases of mics observed were for streptomycin and erythromycin associated with lif against acinetobacter baumannii and streptococcus pneumoniae. an eight-fold reduction was recorded for streptomycin against s. pneumoniae whereas an eight-fold and a sixteen-fold reduction were obtained for erythromycin against a. baumannii and s. pneumoniae. this suggests that lif exhibits a synergistic effect with a wide range of antibiotics and is indicative of its potential as an adjuvant in antibiotic therapy.

TI  == profile of antibiotic consumption, sensitivity and resistance in an urban area of andhra pradesh, india.
AB  == introduction: antibiotics are an important category of drugs in which indiscriminate use can affect the susceptibility patterns among infectious organisms, resulting in antibiotic resistance. methods: data on antibiotic usage  and susceptibility patterns were collected from public and private health centres in vijayawada, andhra pradesh, india, through the use of questionnaires. the data collected were then coded, tabulated, computed and evaluated using statistical analysis. results: the consumption profile of the different categories of drugs used in public and private hospitals was as follows: nutrition and metabolism products 19.0%; gastrointestinal disorder-related drugs 18.5%; antibiotics 16.8%; anti-pyretics and anti-analgesics 20.6%. these drugs were found to be in high demand. among the antibiotics, aminoglycosides (amikacin), quinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin), tetracyclines (doxycycline), penicillin (ampicillin) and sulphonamides (co-trimoxazole) were the most commonly prescribed drugs for antibiotic therapy. 46% of the culture laboratory reports were positive with the  following organism profile: escherichia coli (36%), klebsiella pneumoniae (16%),  staphylococcus aureus (29%), enterococcus faecalis (9%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%). in terms of the sensitivity profile of antibacterials, amikacin (66.9%) was the only antibiotic showing sensitivity patterns, while the majority  of antibiotics, such as cotrimoxazole, nalidixic acid, amoxicillin, gentamycin and norfloxacin, had acquired a resistance rate of 55.1%-80.6%. conclusion: the results of this study suggest that indiscriminate prescription and consumption of new broad-spectrum antibiotics against sensitive organisms results in the development of antimicrobial resistance. therefore, there is an urgent need to curb the excessive use of antibiotics in local hospitals in order to control the  trend of increasing antimicrobial resistance to antibiotics.

TI  == in vitro study of elution kinetics and bio-activity of meropenem-loaded acrylic bone cement.
AB  == background: use of antibiotic-loaded acrylic bone cement to treat orthopaedic infections continues to remain popular, but resistance to routinely used antibiotics has led to the search for alternative, more effective antibiotics. we studied, in vitro, the elution kinetics and bio-activity of different concentrations of meropenem-loaded acrylic bone cement. methods: meropenem-loaded bone cement cylinders of different concentrations were serially immersed in normal saline. elution kinetics was studied by measuring the drug concentration in the eluate, collected at pre-determined intervals, by high-performance liquid  chromatography. bio-activity of the eluate of two different antibiotic concentrations was tested for a period of 3 weeks against each of the following organisms: staphylococcus aureus atcc 2593 (mssa), enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, escherichia coli atcc 25922, s. aureus  atcc 43300 (mrsa) and klebsiella pneumoniae atcc 700603 (esbl). results: meropenem elutes from acrylic bone cement for a period of 3-27 days depending on  the concentration of antibiotic. higher doses of antibiotic concentration resulted in greater elution of the antibiotic. the eluate was found to be biologically active against s. aureus atcc 2593 (mssa), p. aeruginosa atcc 27853, e. coli atcc 25922 and k. pneumoniae atcc 700603 (esbl) for a period of 3 weeks.  conclusions: the elution of meropenem is in keeping with typical antibiotic-loaded acrylic bone cement elution characteristics. the use of high-dose meropenem-loaded acrylic bone cement seems to be an attractive option for treatment of resistant gram-negative orthopaedic infections but needs to be tested in vivo.

TI  == inhibition of candida albicans yeast-hyphal transition and biofilm formation by solidago virgaurea water extracts.
AB  == xerostomia is a decrease of saliva secretion, which can unbalance the oral microflora, mainly to the benefit of candida albicans. the aim of the present study was to find a plant extract that could create an unfavourable environment for candida, and would, therefore, be appropriate for use in a dry-mouth daily-care mouthwash. water extract from the herbaceous plant solidago virgaurea  (goldenrod) was selected due to its saponin content (plant detergents). saponin concentrations reached 0.7 and 0.95 mg ml(-1) in s. virgaurea subsp. virgaurea and s. virgaurea subsp. alpestris extracts, respectively. c. albicans was grown in liquid medium and cells were counted by microscopic examination after 0, 4 and 24 h of incubation. solidago extracts did not inhibit the growth of c. albicans (four strains), escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius or enterococcus faecalis. when inocula were incubated with solidago extract for 4 and 24 h, we observed a decrease in candida yeast-hyphal transition. candida biofilms were then prepared  in microtitre plates and treated with plant extracts at 0 h, to estimate biofilm  formation, or at 18 h to estimate the effect of the saponin on pre-formed biofilms. biofilm formation and pre-formed biofilms were both strongly inhibited. in conclusion, the s. virgaurea extract was efficient against two key virulence factors of c. albicans: the yeast-hyphal transition phase and biofilm formation.

TI  == garlic ointment inhibits biofilm formation by bacterial pathogens from burn wounds.
AB  == when thermal injury damages the skin, the physical barrier protecting underlying  tissues from invading micro-organisms is compromised and the host's immune system becomes supressed, facilitating colonization and infection of burn wounds with micro-organisms. within the wound, bacteria often develop biofilms, which protect the bacteria from the immune response and enhance their resistance to antibiotics. as the prophylactic use of conventional antibiotics drives selection of drug-resistant strains, the use of novel agents to prevent biofilm formation by wound pathogens is essential. in the present study, we utilized our recently developed in vitro wound biofilm model to examine the antibiofilm activity of garlic (allium sativum). wound pathogens were inoculated on sterile cellulose discs, exposed to formulated garlic ointment (garo) or ointment base, and incubated to allow biofilm development. biofilms were quantified and visualized microscopically. garo prevented biofilm development by staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella pneumoniae, and caused a 2-5 log reduction of the bioburden within enterococcus faecalis biofilms. additionally, garo disrupted partially developed  biofilms produced by s. aureus, s. epidermidis and a. baumannii. the antistaphylococcal activity of garo was stable for over 3 months at room temperature. thus, garo could be used as a prophylactic therapy to prevent wound  biofilms caused by both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria from forming, and may be a potential therapy for disrupting established staphylococcal biofilms.

TI  == post-operative wound infection in salvage laryngectomy: does antibiotic prophylaxis have an impact?
AB  == salvage laryngectomy carries a high risk of post-operative infection with reported rates of 40-61%. the purpose of this study was to analyse infections in  our own patients and review the potential impact of our current antibiotic prophylaxis (ap). a retrospective analysis of infection in 26 consecutive patients between 2000 and 2010 undergoing salvage total laryngectomy (sl) following recurrent laryngeal cancer after failed radiotherapy or chemo-radiation was undertaken. the antibiotic prophylaxis was intravenous teicoplanin, cefuroxime and metronidazole at induction and for the following 24 h. infection was defined by tabet and johnson's grade 5, categorized as pharyngocutaneous fistula. fifteen patients (58%) developed a post-operative wound infection, which occurred on average at 12 days after surgery. univariate analysis demonstrated three risk variables that had a significant correlation with infection: alcohol consumption (p = 0.01), cn stage of tumour (p < 0.01), and pre-operative albumin  levels <3.2 g/l (p = 0.012). there was a trend, though not significant, for increased infection in patients with high or low bmis. the most common organisms  isolated from clinical samples from infected patients were methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus mrsa (43%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (36%), serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and enterococcus faecalis (7% each). all these organisms are typical hospital-acquired pathogens. pseudomonas and serratia were  not covered by the prophylactic regime we used. the current antibiotic regime following sl is inadequate as the rate of infection is high. it would therefore seem logical to trial a separate antibiotic protocol of ap for patients undergoing sl that would include an extended course of antibiotics after the standard prophylaxis. in addition, infection rates may also be reduced by improving the metabolic state of patients pre-operatively by multi-disciplinary action. steps should also be taken to reduce cross-infection with nosocomial pathogens in these patients. other aspects of surgical management should be also  taken in consideration.

TI  == antioxidant, antimicrobial activities and fatty acid components of flower, leaf,  stem and seed of hypericum scabrum.
AB  == the hexane extracts of flower, leaf, stem, and seed of hypericum scabrum, which were collected from northwestern iran, were obtained by extraction in a soxhlet apparatus. the fatty acids were converted to methyl esters and determined by gas  chromatography/flame ionization detector (gc/fid) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (gc/ms) systems. the hexane extract from the flower, leaf, stem, and seed contained 39.1%, 43.2%, 29.0%, and 37.6% of omega-3 fatty acids, respectively. the other main components of the flower extract were tetracosane (12.2%) and palmitic acid (9.3%), and that of the leaf extract was palmitic acid  (7.4%). the stem and seed extracts contained bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (18.7% and 35.7%), nonacosane (11.7% and 3.9%) and linoleic acid (6.5% and 6.9%) as major components. the hexane extracts of different parts from h. scabrum represent an important source of omega-3 fatty acids in several hypericum species. the antioxidant activity of all hexane extracts was evaluated by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (dpph) radical scavenging method. the results indicate that hexane extracts from different parts of h. scabrum possess considerable antioxidant activity. the highest radical scavenging activity was detected in seed, which had an ic50 = 165 microg/ml. the antimicrobial activity of the extracts of those samples were determined against seven gram-positive and  gram-negative bacteria (bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus  aureus, s. epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella  pneumoniae), as well as three fungi (candida albicans, saccharomyces cerevisiae,  and aspergillus niger). the bioassay showed that the oil exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity. this study reveals that the all parts of this plant are attractive sources of fatty acid components, especially the essential ones, as well as of effective natural antioxidants.

TI  == influence of terminal substitution on structural, dna, protein binding, anticancer and antibacterial activities of palladium(ii) complexes containing 3-methoxy salicylaldehyde-4(n) substituted thiosemicarbazones.
AB  == the variable chelating behavior of 3-methoxysalicylaldehyde-4(n)-substituted thiosemicarbazones was observed in equimolar reactions with [pdcl(2)(pph(3))(2)]. the new complexes were characterized by various analytical, spectroscopic techniques (mass, (1)h-nmr, absorption, ir). all the new complexes were structurally characterized by single crystal x-ray diffraction. crystallographic  results showed that the ligands h(2)l(1) and h(2)l(4) are coordinated as binegative tridentate ons donor ligands in the complexes 1 and 4 by forming six and five member rings. however, the ligands h(2)l(2) and h(2)l(3) bound to palladium in 2 and 3 as uninegative bidentate ns donors by forming a five member  chelate ring. from this study, it was found that the substitution on terminal 4(n)-nitrogen may have an influence on the chelating ability of thiosemicarbazone. the presence of hydrogen bonding in 2 and 3 might be responsible for preventing the coordination of phenolic oxygen to the metal ion.  the interaction of the complexes with calf-thymus dna (ct-dna) has been explored  by absorption and emission titration methods. based on the observations, an electrostatic binding mode of dna has been proposed. the protein binding studies  were monitored by quenching of tryptophan and tyrosine residues in the presence of complexes using lysozyme as model protein. antibacterial activity studies of the complexes have been screened against pathogenic bacteria such as enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia and pseudomonas aeruginosa. mic50 values of the complexes showed that they exhibited  significant activity against the pathogens and among them, 3 exhibited higher activity. further, anticancer activity of the complexes on the lung cancer cell line a549 has also been studied.

TI  == ce-duox1/bli-3 generated reactive oxygen species trigger protective skn-1 activity via p38 mapk signaling during infection in c. elegans.
AB  == infected animals will produce reactive oxygen species (ros) and other inflammatory molecules that help fight pathogens, but can inadvertently damage host tissue. therefore specific responses, which protect and repair against the collateral damage caused by the immune response, are critical for successfully surviving pathogen attack. we previously demonstrated that ros are generated during infection in the model host caenorhabditis elegans by the dual oxidase ce-duox1/bli-3. herein, an important connection between ros generation by ce-duox1/bli-3 and upregulation of a protective transcriptional response by skn-1 is established in the context of infection. skn-1 is an ortholog of the mammalian nrf transcription factors and has previously been documented to promote survival, following oxidative stress, by upregulating genes involved in the detoxification  of ros and other reactive compounds. using qrt-pcr, transcriptional reporter fusions, and a translational fusion, skn-1 is shown to become highly active in the c. elegans intestine upon exposure to the human bacterial pathogens, enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. activation is dependent on the  overall pathogenicity of the bacterium, demonstrated by a weakened response observed in attenuated mutants of these pathogens. previous work demonstrated a role for p38 mapk signaling both in pathogen resistance and in activating skn-1 upon exposure to chemically induced oxidative stress. we show that nsy-1, sek-1 and pmk-1 are also required for skn-1 activity during infection. evidence is also presented that the ros produced by ce-duox1/bli-3 is the source of skn-1 activation via p38 mapk signaling during infection. finally, for the first time,  skn-1 activity is shown to be protective during infection; loss of skn-1 decreases resistance, whereas increasing skn-1 activity augments resistance to pathogen. overall, a model is presented in which ros generation by ce-duox1/bli-3 activates a protective skn-1 response via p38 mapk signaling.

TI  == an evaluation of the processing conditions, structure, and properties (biaxial flexural strength and antibacterial efficacy) of sintered strontium-zinc-silicate glass ceramics.
AB  == the use of artificial bone grafts has increased in order to satisfy a growing demand for bone replacement materials. initial mechanical stability of synthetic  bone grafts is very advantageous for certain clinical applications. coupled with  the advantage of mechanical strength, a material with inherent antibacterial properties would be very beneficial. a series of strontium-doped zinc silicate (ca-sr-na-zn-si) glass ceramics have been characterized in terms of their crystalline structure, biaxial flexural strength and antibacterial efficacy based on the identification of optimum sintering conditions. all three glass ceramics,  namely, bt110, bt111, and bt112 were found to be fully crystalline, with bt111 and bt112 comprising of biocompatible crystalline phases. the biaxial flexural strengths of the three glass ceramics ranged from 70 to 149 mpa and were shown to be superior to those of clinically established ceramics in dry conditions and following incubation in simulated physiological conditions. the bacteriostatic effect for each glass ceramic was also established, where bt112 showed an inhibitory effect against three of the most common bacteria found at implantation sites, namely, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the results of the evaluation suggest that the materials studied offer advantages over current clinical materials and indicate the potential suitability of the glass ceramics as therapeutic bone grafts.

TI  == [the first experience of application of pcr techniques in real-time mode to diagnose bacteriemia during postoperational period in cardiosurgery patients].
AB  == the results comparison is made between pcr polymerase chain reaction techniques in real-time mode and cultural techniques of analysis of blood samples in patients with suspicion of bacteriemia during early postoperational period. from  september to december 2009 43 blood samples from 37 adult patients aged 59+9.2 years were analyzed on suspicion of bacteriemia. the blood samples for pcr analysis (septifast technique roche diagnostics, switzerland) were taken parallel to the inoculation. among 43 samples 20 (46.5%) were positive. the species structure of identified germs was as follows: enteroccocus faecalis - 2, klebsiella pneumonia - 2, enteroccocusfaecium - 1, pseudomonas aeruginosa - 2, coagulase negative staphilococcus - 11. all cases of seeding of coagulase negative staphilococcus were interpreted using pcr techniques as negative or contamination. in four cases a full matching of results of compared techniques was obtained. in cases when hemoculture was negative (n = 23) the pcr techniques  permitted to detect two positive results (staphilococcus spp. and stenotrophomonas maltophilia). in three cases of positive hemoculture the pcr techniques brought negative result and at that in two cases the causative agents  (pseudomonas fluorescens and ralstonia mannitolilytica) were out of specter of pathogens detected by this method. the pcr techniques in real-time mode permit to reduce significantly time of pathogen investigation and to detect the false positive results conditioned by contamination. this techniques has to be applied  in parallel with cultural technique because only this approach provide a possibility to get the clinically needed data related to the sensitivity of causative agent to antibacterial preparations.

TI  == chlorine disinfection of pseudomonas aeruginosa, total coliforms, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis: revisiting reclaimed water regulations.
AB  == pathogenic organisms can be transmitted orally through drinking water or through  skin and mucosae by both direct and indirect contact, and their presence in water thus has a negative impact on public health. in wastewater treatment plants (wwtp), water is disinfected to inactivate pathogens. the quantification of several microbial indicators in aquatic systems is required to estimate the biological quality of such systems. so far, coliform bacteria have been used as traditional indicators world-wide. this study has assessed the resistance of total coliforms, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis to three dosages of sodium hypochlorite (naclo) at two exposure times. the bacteria were isolated from secondary effluents of a wwtp located in hidalgo, mexico. the results show that the number of colony-forming units of all studied bacterial types decreased when both the naclo concentration and exposure times increased. however, they were not eliminated. the inclusion of the species pseudomonas aeruginosa in regulations for treated wastewater quality as a new indicator is highly recommended due to its importance as an opportunistic pathogen. the detection of this species along with the traditional organisms could be particulary significant for reclaimed water to be used with direct human contact.

TI  == antibacterial activity of some african medicinal plants used traditionally against infectious diseases.
AB  == context: plants are known to play a crucial role in african traditional medicine  for the treatment of infection diseases. objectives: to investigate the claimed antimicrobial properties of plants traditionally used in african countries, providing scientific validation for their use. materials and methods: eighty-three polar and non-polar extracts from 22 medicinal plants were screened  for their antibacterial activity against gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae) and mycobacterium smegmatis using the broth microdilution method. results and discussion: in vitro antibacterial activity against one or more tested bacteria was shown by 83% of the extracts. the highest activity was obtained with the methanol extracts of the aerial parts of acacia karroo hayne (fabaceae) and anacardium occidentale l. (anacardiaceae) and the roots of bridelia cathartica g. bertol (euphorbiaceae), against s. aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) = 7.5 microg/ml). the same mic values were exhibited against e. faecalis by the methanol extract of a. occidentale, the dichloromethane and methanol extracts of b. cathartica and the ethyl acetate extract of momordica balsamina l. (curcubitaceae) leaves. gram-negative bacteria  were less sensitive; the growth of p. aeruginosa was significantly inhibited (mic = 31 microg/ml) by the n-hexane and methanol extracts of gomphocarpus fruticosus  (l.) ait. (asclepiadaceae) fruits and by the dichloromethane extract of trichilia emetica vahl (meliaceae) seeds. most of the active extracts were rich in fenols/flavonoids. conclusion: this study supports the use of most of the studied plants in traditional medicine, for the treatment of infectious diseases. some of them are worthy of further investigation.

TI  == extracellular dna in biofilms.
AB  == extracellular dna (edna) is an important biofilm component that was recently discovered. its presence has been initially observed in biofilms of pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, then enterococcus faecalis and staphylococci. autolysis is the common mechanism by which edna is released. in p. aeruginosa edna is generated by lysis of a bacterial subpopulation, under control of quorum sensing system. in e. faecalis autolysis proceeds in a fratricide mode, resulting from a process similar to necrosis of eukaryotic cells. in staphylococcus aureus autolysis originates by an altruistic  suicide, i.e., a programmed cell death similar to apoptosis of eukaryotic cells.  in s. aureus autolysis is mediated by murein hydrolase, while in s. epidermidis by the autolysin protein atle. in p. aeruginosa edna is located primarily in the  stalks of mushroom-shaped multicellular structures. in s. aureus the crucial role of edna in stabilizing biofilm is highlighted by the disgregating effect of dnase i. edna represents an important mechanism for horizontal gene transfer in bacteria. edna and other microbial structural motifs are recognized by the innate immune system via the tlr family of pattern recognition receptors (prrs).

TI  == enhanced antibacterial activity of bimetallic gold-silver core-shell nanoparticles at low silver concentration.
AB  == herein we report the development of bimetallic au@ag core-shell nanoparticles (nps) where gold nanoparticles (au nps) served as the seeds for continuous deposition of silver atoms on its surface. the core-shell structure and morphology were examined by uv-vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (tem), energy dispersive x-ray (edx) analysis and x-ray diffraction (xrd). the core-shell nps showed antibacterial activity against both gram negative (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram positive (enterococcus faecalis and pediococcus acidilactici) bacteria at low concentration of silver present in the shell, with more efficacy against gram negative bacteria. tem and  flow cytometric studies showed that the core-shell nps attached to the bacterial  surface and caused membrane damage leading to cell death. the enhanced antibacterial properties of au@ag core-shell nps was possibly due to the more active silver atoms in the shell surrounding gold core due to high surface free energy of the surface ag atoms owing to shell thinness in the bimetallic np structure.

TI  == polycationic chitosan-conjugated photosensitizer for antibacterial photodynamic therapy.
AB  == the complex nature of bacterial cell membrane and structure of biofilm has challenged the efficacy of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy. this study was aimed to synthesize a polycationic chitosan-conjugated rose bengal (csrb) photosensitizer and test its antibiofilm efficacy on enterococcus faecalis (gram  positive) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (gram negative) using photodynamic therapy.  during experiments, csrb was tested along with an anionic photosensitizer rose bengal (rb) and a cationic photosensitizer methylene blue (mb) for uptake and killing efficacy on 7-day-old e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa biofilms. microbiological culture based analysis was used to analyze the cell viability, while laser scanning confocal microscopy (lscm) was used to examine the structure of biofilm. the synthesized csrb showed absorbance spectrum similar to the rb. the concentration of csrb uptaken by both the bacterial biofilms was significantly higher than that of rb and mb (p < 0.05). photoactivation resulted  in significantly higher elimination of both bacterial biofilms sensitized with csrb than rb and mb. the structure of biofilm under lscm was found to be disrupted following csrb treatment. the present study highlighted the importance  of inherent cell membrane permeabilizing effect of chitosan and increased cell/biofilm uptake of conjugated photosensitizer to produce significant antibiofilm efficacy during photodynamic therapy.

TI  == wfdc2 is differentially expressed in the mammary gland of the tammar wallaby and  provides immune protection to the mammary gland and the developing pouch young.
AB  == wap four disulfide core domain 2 (wfdc2) is a four disulfide core (4-dsc) protein secreted in the milk of the tammar wallaby. it is comprised of two 4-dsc domains  assigned domain iii at the nh2-terminal end and domain ii at the cooh-terminal end. the wfdc2 gene was expressed only during pregnancy, early lactation, towards the end of lactation and involution. the wfdc2 protein showed antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica and pseudomonas aeruginosa and this activity resided with domain ii. there was no antibacterial activity detected against enterococcus faecalis. the observed expression pattern  of tammar wfdc2 and its antibacterial activity suggests a role to either reduce mastitis in the mammary gland caused by s. aureus or to protect the gut of the young at a time when it is not immune-competent. the latter effect could be achieved without disturbing the balance of commensal gut flora such as e. faecalis.

TI  == surgical therapy of hip-joint empyema. is the girdlestone arthroplasty still up to date?
AB  == purpose: hip-joint empyema is a severe local infection that can cause general illness and, in the worst-case scenario, death by septic complications. for severe hip-joint infections, the girdlestone arthroplasty has been an established treatment option for many decades. we describe functional midterm results after treatment of haematological and postoperative hip-joint infections. methods: from 2000 to 2010, 24 patients underwent surgical treatment for 27 hip-joint empyemas. the surgical procedures included radical debridement, implantation of local antibiotic beads and soft tissue management. besides clinical, laboratory and imaging parameters, we analysed the harris hip score (hhs). results: twenty-three patients (26 hips) were followed up after a mean of 30 (3.1-126.8) months. the study group consists of 12 men and 11 women, with an average height of 1.71 m, weight of 84.7 kg and body mass index (bmi) of 28.6 kg/m(2). hip-joint empyema was due to haematological septic spread in eight patients, surgery related in 12  hips and other causes in six cases. one patient died due to septic complications  during the hospital stay. intraoperative bacterial culture was positive in 50%, with staphylococcus aureus as the most common organism (n = 11). average hospital stay was 35 days. hhs significantly improved from 18.2 preoperatively to 47.8 at  follow-up. functional results were mainly poor, but pain relief increased significantly. the infection control rate was 96% with four (15%) complications.  conclusion: resection arthroplasty by girdlestone is able to control infection in most cases with an acceptable complication rate but poor functional results. in conclusion, the girdlestone arthroplasty still is an essential surgical strategy  for treating hip-joint empyema in cases in which functional outcome is of lesser  priority.

TI  == the revival of fosfomycin.
AB  == fosfomycin, originally named phosphonomycin, was discovered in spain in 1969. there are three forms of fosfomycin: fosfomycin tromethamine (a soluble salt) and fosfomycin calcium for oral use, and fosfomycin disodium for intravenous use. fosfomycin is a bactericidal antibiotic that interferes with cell wall synthesis  in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by inhibiting the initial step involving phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase. it has a broad spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. it is highly active against gram-positive pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus, and against gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae. its unique mechanism of action may provide a synergistic effect to other classes of antibiotics including beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones. oral fosfomycin is mainly used in the treatment of urinary tract infections, particularly those caused by escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis. intravenous fosfomycin has been administered in combination with other antibiotics for the treatment of nosocomial infections due to multidrug-resistant (mdr) gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. fosfomycin has good distribution into tissues, achieving clinically relevant concentrations  in serum, kidneys, bladder wall, prostate, lungs, inflamed tissues, bone, cerebrospinal fluid, abscess fluid, and heart valves. fosfomycin is well tolerated, with a low incidence of adverse events. further randomized controlled  trials are needed in order to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous fosfomycin for the management of nosocomial infections due to mdr pathogens.

AB  == some bacterial life states are only difficult to describe and to detect because they are on the border of active metabolism. a prominent example is the so-called viable but non-culturable state, which is mainly characterized by the inability of bacteria to grow on synthetic media. matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof/ms) in combination with multivariate data analysis represents a powerful tool for mass-spectrometric pattern recognition of biological samples. this method is already used for differentiation of bacterial strains. in this study we present a rapid readout method based on maldi-tof/ms in combination with principal component analysis to  classify the bacterial non-culturable state using enterococcus faecalis as a model organism. by applying this technique to samples of different physiological  states, distinct clusters were calculated and all mass spectra were classified correctly into groups of similar type concerning their physiological state.

TI  == validation of the zurich burn-biofilm model.
AB  == background: despite advances in the use of topical and parenteral antimicrobial therapy and the practice of early tangential burn-wound excision, bacterial infection remains a major problem in the management of burn victims today. the purpose of this study was to design and evaluate a polyspecies biofilm model with bacteria known to cause severe infections in burn patients. the model is simple to prepare, maintain and analyse, and allows for short-term exposure to antimicrobials. results: initial experiments showed that it was impossible to establish balanced polyspecies biofilms with an inoculum of gram-positive and -negative bacteria. after 64.5 h of incubation, the gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) had suppressed the gram-positives (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus intermedius). however, adding the gram-negative bacteria after 41.5 h to an established biofilm of gram-positives resulted in a balanced microbial consortium. after 64.5 h, all  species were present in high numbers (10(7) to 10(8) colony forming units (cfu) per biofilm). multiple repetitions showed high reproducibility of biofilm formation without significant differences between and within experiments. combined fluorescence in situ hybridisation/confocal laser scanning microscopy (fish/clsm) analyses, for which biofilms had to be grown on a different non-flexible substrate (hydroxy apatite), revealed that, by 41.5 h, the biofilm consisted of an almost confluent layer of bacteria firmly adherent to the substratum. after 64.5 h (22 h after the addition of the gram negatives), the biofilm consisted of a confluent mixture of single cells, an abundance of galaxies of bacteria with small lacunae and large amounts of extracellular matrix polysaccharides. conclusions: the polyspecies biofilm model contains the most prevalent burn-associated gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens and mimics the gram-negative shift observed in vivo. it shows excellent reproducibility. it should allow adaptation to the bacterial spectrum prevalent in different burn centres and lead to a much more reliable investigation of the efficiency of topical antimicrobial agents than models operating with planktonic  bacteria. the experiments further open up the perspective to create an in vivo model using these biofilms as infectious agents.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in bacteria isolated from vegetables with regards to the marketing stage (farm vs. supermarket).
AB  == the aim of this study was to elucidate whether and to what extent fresh produce from germany plays a role as a carrier and reservoir of antibiotic resistant bacteria. for this purpose, 1001 vegetables (fruit, root, bulbous vegetables, salads and cereals) were collected from 13 farms and 11 supermarkets in germany and examined bacteriologically. phenotypic resistance of enterobacter cloacae (n=172); enterobacter gergoviae (n=92); pantoea agglomerans (n=96); pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=295); pseudomonas putida (n=106) and enterococcus faecalis (n=100)  against up to 30 antibiotics was determined by using the microdilution method. resistance to ss-lactams was most frequently expressed by p. agglomerans and e. gergoviae against cefaclor (41% and 29%). relatively high resistance rates were also observed for doxycycline (23%), erythromycin (21%) and rifampicin (65%) in e. faecalis, for spectinomycin (28%) and mezlocillin (12%) in e. cloacae, as well as for streptomycin (19%) in p. putida. in p. aeruginosa, relatively low resistance rates were observed for the aminoglycosides amikacin, apramicin, gentamicin, neomycin, netilmicin and tobramycin (<4%); 11% was resistant to streptomycin. no glycopeptide-resistant enterococci were observed. resistance rates of bacteria isolated from farm samples were higher than those of the retail markets whenever significant differences were observed. this suggests that expressing resistance is at the expense of bacterial viability, since vegetables  purchased directly at the farm are probably fresher than at the supermarket, and  they have not been exposed to stress factors. however, this should not keep the customer from buying directly at the farm, since the overall resistance rates were not higher than observed in bacteria from human or animal origin. instead, peeling or washing vegetables before eating them raw is highly recommended, since it reduces not only the risk of contact with pathogens, but also that of ingesting and spreading antibiotic resistant bacteria.

AB  == we studied the antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against 960 strains of commonly encountered bacteria associated with urinary tract infection using standard agar dilution and disk diffusion methods. species studied included 3 common species of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia; methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus; and vancomycin-susceptible and resistant enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. mics and inhibition zone diameters were interpreted in accordance with both the currently recommended clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) criteria for urinary tract isolates of escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) criteria for enterobacteriaceae. tentative zone diameter interpretive criteria were developed for species not currently published by clsi or eucast. escherichia coli was uniformly susceptible to fosfomycin, as were most strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. a. baumannii was resistant to fosfomycin, while the prevalence of resistance in p. aeruginosa and s. maltophilia was greatly affected by the choice of mic breakpoint. new tentative zone diameter criteria for k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, s. aureus, and e. faecium were able to be set, providing some interim laboratory guidance for disk diffusion until further breakpoint evaluations are undertaken by clsi and eucast.

TI  == recognition of pathogenic microbes by the drosophila phagocytic pattern recognition receptor eater.
AB  == non-opsonic phagocytosis is a primordial form of pathogen recognition that is mediated by the direct interaction of phagocytic receptors with microbial surfaces. in the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster, the egf-like repeat containing scavenger receptor eater is expressed by phagocytes and is required to survive infections with gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. however, the mechanisms by which this receptor recognizes different types of bacteria are poorly understood. to address this problem, we generated a soluble, fc-tagged receptor variant of eater comprising the n-terminal 199 amino acids including four egf-like repeats. we first established that eater-fc displayed specific binding to broad yet distinct classes of heat- or ethanol-inactivated microbes and behaved similarly to the membrane-bound, full-length eater receptor. we then  used eater-fc as a tool to probe eater binding to the surface of live bacteria. eater-fc bound equally well to naive or inactivated staphylococcus aureus or enterococcus faecalis, suggesting that in vivo, eater directly targets live gram-positive bacteria, enabling their phagocytic clearance and destruction. by contrast, eater-fc was unable to interact with live, naive gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for these bacteria, eater-fc binding required membrane-disrupting treatments. furthermore,  we found that cecropin a, a cationic, membrane-disrupting antimicrobial peptide,  could promote eater-fc binding to live e. coli, even at sublethal concentrations. these results suggest a previously unrecognized mechanism by which antimicrobial  peptides cooperate with phagocytic receptors to extend the range of microbes that can be targeted by a single, germline-encoded receptor.

TI  == susceptibility of gram-positive and -negative bacteria to novel nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle technology.
AB  == the rapidly evolving crisis of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms has contributed to the rise of patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial and community-acquired infections. therefore, innovative antimicrobial technology targeting mechanisms to which the bacteria are unlikely to evolve resistance is urgently needed. we have previously described a nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle (no-np) with efficacy against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and acinetobacter baumannii in vitro and in murine wound and abscess models. although the prior findings suggest that the no-np can be a useful therapeutic for skin and soft tissue infections, the antimicrobial spectrum of no-np has yet to be fully elucidated. in the current study, we investigated the efficacy of a no-np against several gram-positive and -negative  clinical isolates. we found that the no-np were uniformly active against all of the streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates examined, including strains that were both sensitive and resistant to commonly used antibiotics. we concluded that the no-np have the potential to serve as a novel broad spectrum antimicrobial agent.

TI  == [trends of antimicrobial resistance in microbial strains isolated from invasive infections in romania. experience of participation in earss (european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system), 2002-2008].
AB  == earss (european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system) is the biggest antimicrobial resistance surveillance project in the world financed from public finds, aiming to provide validated and comparable official data on antimicrobial  resistance of invasive microbial strains (isolated from blood and csf), belonging to 6 indicator bacterial species, i.e.: s. aureus, e. coli, e. faecium/faecalis,  str. pneumoniae, ps. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae. romania reported data to earss since 2002 so far. though the number of participating laboratories increased progressively from 12 to 35, the number of hospitals which reported for earss. as the number of strains included in the data base remained steady and relatively low. this issue is related to the particular position of romania in the european  context, in respect of the very low number of blood cultures performed in hospitals. our paper is presenting the trends of antimicrobial resistance in the  indicator strains in the 2002-2008 interval. during the 2002-2008 interval, romania reported to earss a total number of 1276 bacterial strains, distributed by species as follows: 513 s aureus, 369 e. coli, 128 streptococcus pneumoniae, 127 enterococcus spp.. 71 klebsiella pneumoniae, 68 pseudomonas aeruginosa. klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were reported, according to the  earss protocol, only for the 2005-2008 interval. it is difficult to describe trends, specially in enterococcus, streptococcus pneumonaie and the 2 species collected only since 2005, because of the low number of isolates, but there are several results that are supporting us to claim that antimicrobial resistance in  invasive isolates is a real problem in romanian hospitals, like in other central, southern and south eastern european countries: more than 25% of s. aureus strains resistant to methicilline, with more than 50% in some years, high aminoglycozides resistance in more than 70-80% of enterococcus faecium invasive strains, more than 80% of strains resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporines etc.

TI  == n-benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines are a new class of bacterial dna gyrase inhibitors.
AB  == this paper characterizes n-benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines (gyramides) as dna gyrase inhibitors. gyramide a was previously shown to exhibit antimicrobial activity that suggested it inhibited bacterial cell division. in this study, we conducted target identification studies and identified dna gyrase as the primary  target of gyramide a. the gyramide a resistance-determining region in dna gyrase  is adjacent to the dna cleavage gate and is a new site for inhibitor design. we studied the antibiotic effects of gyramides a-c in combination with the gram-negative efflux pump inhibitor mc-207,110 (60 mum). the gyramides had a minimum inhibitory concentration of 10-40 mum against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae; the compounds were ineffective against enterococcus faecalis. the ic(50) of gyramides a-c against e. coli dna gyrase was 0.7- 3.3 mum. the n-benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines described in this manuscript represent a starting point for development of antibiotics that bind a new site in dna gyrase.

TI  == spectrum of early-onset and late-onset bacteremias after liver transplantation: implications for management.
AB  == bacteremia is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation. the characterization of the microbiological spectrum of bacteremia after liver transplantation may help physicians in choosing the initial empirical antimicrobial therapy for patients presenting with sepsis. the  clinical and microbiology records of patients who received liver transplantation  from january 1997 to march 2006 were reviewed. one hundred twenty-three of the 737 liver recipients (16.7%) developed bacteremia during the median follow-up period of 5.8 years (interquartile range = 2.5-8.8 years); 92 patients (12.5%) had gram-positive bacteremia (gpb), whereas 47 (6.4%) had gram-negative bacteremia (gnb). nosocomial bacteremia was significantly more frequent among patients with early-onset gpb or gnb versus patients with late-onset gpb (66.7% versus 23.7%, p < 0.001) or gnb (70.6% versus 20.0%, p = 0.001). peritonitis (33.3% versus 7.9%, p = 0.004) and wound infections (13.0% versus 0%, p = 0.04) as sources were more common in patients with early-onset gpb versus patients with late-onset gpb. likewise, peritonitis was a more common source of early-onset gnb than late-onset gnb (41.2% versus 6.7%, p = 0.007). staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium were the most common pathogens in patients with early-onset  gpb, whereas enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus species were most common in  patients with late-onset gpb. pseudomonas aeruginosa and anaerobes were the most  common pathogens in patients with early-onset gnb, whereas escherichia coli was most common in patients with late-onset gnb. in conclusion, the microbiological spectra of early-onset and late-onset bacteremias differ, and this should be considered by those determining the initial empirical treatment of liver transplant recipients suspected to have bacteremias.

TI  == the role of two families of bacterial enzymes in putrescine synthesis from agmatine via agmatine deiminase.
AB  == putrescine, one of the main biogenic amines associated to microbial food spoilage, can be formed by bacteria from arginine via ornithine decarboxylase (odc), or from agmatine via agmatine deiminase (agdi). this study aims to correlate putrescine production from agmatine to the pathway involving n-carbamoylputrescine formation via addi (the agua product) and n-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase (the agub product), or putrescine carbamoyltransferase (the ptca product) in bacteria. pcr methods were developed to detect the two genes involved in putrescine production from agmatine. putrescine production from agmatine could be linked to the agua and ptca genes in lactobacillus hilgardii x1b, enterococcus faecalis atcc 11700, and bacillus cereus atcc 14579. by contrast lactobacillus sakei 23k was unable to produce putrescine, and although a fragment of dna corresponding to the gene agua was amplified, no amplification was observed for the ptca gene. pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 produces putrescine and is reported to harbour agua and agub genes, responsible for agmatine deiminase and n-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase activities. the enzyme from p. aeruginosa pao1 that converts n-carbamoylputrescine to putrescine (the agub product) is different from other microorganisms studied (the ptca product). therefore, the agub gene from p. aeruginosa pao1 could not be amplified with ptca-specific primers. the agub and ptca genes have frequently been erroneously annotated in the past, as in fact these two enzymes are neither homologous nor analogous. furthermore, the agua, agub and ptca sequences available from genbank were subjected to phylogenetic analysis, revealing that gram-positive bacteria harboured ptca, whereas gram-negative bacteria harbour agub. this paper also discusses the role of the agmatine deiminase system (agds) in acid stress resistance.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the canward 2007-2009 study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. all  staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (mic(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/ml and 2 mug/ml, respectively). ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), </=  0.06 mug/ml), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic(90), </= 0.06 mug/ml), staphylococcus epidermidis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml), and enterococcus faecalis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml). over 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/ml. ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and k. pneumoniae. the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus  pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (mic(90), 16 mug/ml). the  broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.

TI  == [epidemic hazard of water use in the reactivation of bacteria after disinfection].
AB  == variability in the cultural and biochemical properties of indicator, opportunistic, and pathogenic bacteria and possibilities of their reactivation after exposure to chlorine-containing reagents and during photo-activated disinfection processes in the presence of photosensitizes were experimentally studied to enhance the epidemic reliability and adequacy of microbiological monitoring in the evaluation of the decontamination efficiency of water of its various use types. reactivation of coliform bacteria, enterococci, salmonellas, and the total number of microbes were estimated after exposure to the bacteriostatic doses of sodium hypochlorite and chlorine dioxide when the river and waste waters were decontaminated. during photo-activated disinfection under the action of the photosensitizers methylene blue and proflavin acetate given in  the bacteriostatic doses, there was transition into the uncultivated state, followed by 1-5-day reactivation of both museum strains and strains isolated from waste waters, such as salmonella infantis spp, salmonella enteritidis spp, salmonella enteritidis 5765 atcc, pseudomonas aeruginosa 10145, pseudomonas aeruginosa spp, escherichia coli 1257, staphylococcus aureus 906, and enterococcus faecalis 29212. moreover, pseudomonas and salmonellas not only regained their viability, but also multiplied up to the control level. recommendations are given how to improve methods for monitoring the efficiency of disinfection, by taking into account a possible variability in the cultural and biochemical properties of bacteria and for reactivation by monitoring the trend in the process during 5 days.

TI  == effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic species--an in vitro study.
AB  == the in vitro study was aimed to determine the effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic microorganisms. ozone was generated for 6 s-2 x 24 s (corresponding to 0.56 mg-2 x 2.24 mg of ozone) against 23 mainly anaerobic periodontopathogenic species. agar diffusion test was used as a screening method. then, the killing activity was tested in a serum-free environment and with 25% v/v inactivated serum. further, the effect of ozone on bactericidal activity of native serum was analyzed against fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. agar diffusion test showed a high efficacy of ozone against microorganisms, especially against porphyromonas gingivalis. this result was confirmed by the killing tests; most of the strains in a concentration of 10(5) were completely eliminated after twofold 18-s application of ozone. only four of the six potentially "superinfecting" species (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, candida albicans) survived in part. addition of heat-inactivated serum reduced the killing rate of ozone by 78% after 6-s and by 47% after twofold 18-s exposures; no strain was completely eradicated after any application of ozone. the bactericidal effect of native serum was enhanced after application of ozone; no effect was visible on the included a. actinomycetemcomitans strain which was found to be completely resistant to the bactericidal action of serum. in conclusion, (a) ozone has a strong antibacterial activity against putative periodontopathogenic microorganisms, and (b) the bactericidal effect is reduced in the presence of serum. ozone may have potential as an adjunctive application to mechanical treatment in periodontitis patients.

TI  == evaluation of three swab transport systems for the maintenance of clinically important bacteria in simulated mono- and polymicrobial samples.
AB  == in this study, three swab transport systems were evaluated: m40 transystem, amies broth with a relatively new type of swab (both copan diagnostics, corona, ca, usa), and ssi transportmedium (statens serum institut, copenhagen denmark). the clsi m40-a standard procedures and 11 culture collection strains were used. the transport systems were tested at room temperature for holding times of 0, 24, and 48 h, and both mono- and polymicrobial samples were included. after 24 h of simulated transportation, all systems were able to maintain the viability of all  organisms tested. ssi transportmedium exhibited the lowest maintaining ability, whereas the two copan systems were the most growth-promoting system. in polymicrobial samples, this latter feature was a problem. at 48 h, no transport system could maintain the viability of all strains, and the recovery rates differed depending on organism and device. the species most difficult to recover  in all the three systems was neisseria gonorrhoeae. when selecting a swab transport system, consideration must be given to the sample type, the conditions  that prevail locally, and the performance in the clinical setting.

TI  == enterococcus faecalis virulence regulator fsra binding to target promoters.
AB  == the fsrabdc signal transduction system is a major virulence regulator in enterococcus faecalis. the fsrc sensor histidine kinase, upon activation by the gelatinase biosynthesis-activating pheromone (gbap) peptide encoded by the fsrbd  genes, phosphorylates the fsra response regulator required for the transcription  of the fsrbdc and the gele-spre genes from the fsrb promoter and the gele promoter, respectively. fsra belongs to the lyttr family of proteins, which includes other virulence regulators, such as agra of staphylococcus aureus, algr  of pseudomonas aeruginosa, and virr of clostridium perfringens. the lyttr dna-binding domain that characterizes these proteins generally binds to two imperfect direct repeats separated by a number of bases that place the repeats on the same face of the dna helix. in this study, we demonstrated that fsra also binds to two imperfect direct repeats separated by 13 bp, based on the consensus  sequence of fsra, t/at/caa/gggaa/g, which is consistent with the binding characteristics of lyttr domains.

TI  == suprathel-antiseptic matrix: in vitro model for local antiseptic treatment?
AB  == acetic acid is a traditional antiseptic agent that has been used for more than 6000 years. the main goal of this study was to demonstrate the suitability of suprathel (polymedics innovations gmbh, denkendorf, germany) in combination with  various antiseptic agents to create an "antiseptic-matrix" especially designed for problematic microorganisms such as proteus vulgaris, acinetobacter baumannii, or pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are frequently associated with burns. the study  was designed to test the in vitro antimicrobial effect of a "suprathel-antiseptic matrix" (suprathel combined with acetic acid 3%, povidone-iodine 11% [betaisodona], polyhexanide 0.04% [lavasept], phenoxyethanol 2%/octenidine dihydrochloride 0.1% [octenisept], mafenide acetate 5%, and chlorhexidine gluconate 1.5%/cetrimid 15% [hibicet]). as a means to assess the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following gram-negative and gram-positive  bacteria strains were tested: escherichia coli, p vulgaris, p aeruginosa, a baumannii, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s aureus, and beta-hemolytic streptococcus groups a and b. the tests showed a positive bactericidal effect of the suprathel-antiseptic matrix, particularly with problematic gram-negative bacteria such as p vulgaris, p aeruginosa, and a baumannii, except for the combination of  suprathel and mafenide acetate. it can be concluded that suprathel-antiseptic matrix appears to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but clinical studies need to be performed to confirm these in vitro observations. the authors' previous studies have shown that acetic acid demonstrates a wide antiseptic spectrum for microorganisms typically found in burn patients. the combination of  suprathel and acetic acid worked well in this study and appears to be promising for future clinical application.

AB  == visible light-absorbing cationic water-soluble gallium(iii) phthalocyanines (gapcs) peripherally substituted with four and eight methylpyridyloxy groups were synthesized and investigated as antimicrobial photodynamic sensitizers. the inserted large gallium ion in the phthalocyanine ligand is axially substituted by one hydroxyl group which prevents aggregation of the complexes in aqueous solution. the cellular uptake and the photodynamic activity for the representative strains of the gram positive bacteria methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus(mrsa) and enterococcus faecalis, of the gram negative bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa and of the fungus candida albicans in planktonic phase were studied. the tetra-methylpyridyloxy substituted gapc1 showed lower cellular uptake compared to the octa-methylpyridyloxy substituted gapc2. the photodynamic activity of the gapcs was studied in comparison to methylene blue (mb) and a photodynamically active zn(ii)-phthalocyanine with the same substitution (znpcme). photodynamic treatment with 3.0 mum gapc1 at mild light conditions (50 j cm(-2), 60 mw cm(-2)) resulted in a high photoinactivation of the microorganisms in the planktonic phase nevertheless the dark toxicity of gapc1 towards mrsa and e. faecalis. gapcs against fungal biofilm grown on polymethylmethacrylate (pmmc) resin showed a complete inactivation at a higher concentration of gapc2 (6.0 mum) and of the referent sensitizer znpcme. however,  the bacterial biofilms were not susceptible to treatment of gapcs with only 1-2 log reduction of the biofilm. the bacterial biofilm e. faecalis was effectively inactivated only with mb. the water-soluble octa-methylpyridyloxy substituted gapc2 has a potential value for photodynamic treatment of c. albicans biofilms formed on denture acrylic resin.

TI  == myeloperoxidase selectively binds and selectively kills microbes.
AB  == myeloperoxidase (mpo) is reported to selectively bind to bacteria. the present study provides direct evidence of mpo binding selectivity and tests the relationship of selective binding to selective killing. the microbicidal effectiveness of h(2)o(2) and of ocl(-) was compared to that of mpo plus h(2)o(2). synergistic microbicidal action was investigated by combining streptococcus sanguinis, a h(2)o(2)-producing microbe showing low mpo binding, with high-mpo-binding escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, or pseudomonas aeruginosa without exogenous h(2)o(2), with and without mpo, and with and without erythrocytes (red blood cells [rbcs]). selectivity of mpo microbicidal action was conventionally measured as the mpo mic and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) for 82 bacteria including e. coli, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and viridans streptococci. both h(2)o(2) and ocl(-) destroyed rbcs at submicrobicidal concentrations. nanomolar concentrations of mpo increased h(2)o(2) microbicidal action 1,000-fold. streptococci plus mpo produced potent synergistic microbicidal action against all microbes tested, and rbcs caused only a small decrease in potency without erythrocyte damage. mpo directly killed h(2)o(2)-producing s. pyogenes but was ineffective against non-h(2)o(2)-producing e. faecalis. the mpo  mics and mbcs for e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus were significantly lower  than those for e. faecalis. the streptococcal studies showed much higher mic/mbc  results, but such testing required lysed horse blood-supplemented medium, thus preventing valid comparison of these results to those for the other microbes. e.  faecalis mpo binding is reportedly weak compared to binding of e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus but strong compared to binding of streptococci. selective mpo binding results in selective killing.

AB  == chitosan is an attractive preparation widely used as a pharmaceutical excipient.  this study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial activities of chitosan derivatives, edta, and the newly developed chitosan-edta combination against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria as well as candida albicans. antimicrobial activity was studied. both minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic)  and minimal biocidal concentrations (mbc) were determined. chitosan acetic acid recorded lower mic values against enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans than those exhibited by edta. edta failed to have inhibitory activity against enterococcus faecalis as well as mbc against any of the studied microorganisms. chitosan acetic acid's mbc were recorded to all examined species. checkerboard assay results indicated a synergistic antimicrobial activity of the new combination against staphylococcus aureus and an additive effect against other microorganisms. moreover, a short microbial exposure to chitosan-edta (20-30 min) caused complete eradication. due to the continuous emergence of resistant strains, there is an urgent need to discover new antimicrobial agents. our findings suggest the use of chitosan as an enhancing agent with antibacterial and antifungal properties in combination with edta in pharmaceutical preparations.

TI  == synergism between maggot excretions and antibiotics.
AB  == maggots are successfully used to treat severe, infected wounds. this study investigated whether maggot excretions/secretions influence the antibacterial activity of different antibiotics. minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal  bactericidal concentrations (mbc) were determined of gentamicin and flucloxacillin for staphylococcus aureus, of penicillin for streptococcus pyogenes, of amoxicillin and vancomycin for enterococcus faecalis, of gentamicin  for enterobacter cloacae, and of gentamicin, tobramycin, and ciprofloxacin for pseudomonas aeruginosa by checkerboard titration. a range of concentrations of antibiotics in combination with excretions/secretions was examined to investigate the potential of maggot excretions/secretions to affect antibacterial activity. the results showed a dose-dependent increase of the antibacterial effect of gentamicin in the presence of excretions/secretions on s. aureus. minimal concentrations and mbc of gentamicin decreased, respectively, 64- and 32-fold. the mbc of flucloxacillin and excretions/secretions against s. aureus were also decreased. the other antibiotic and excretions/secretions combinations exerted an indifferent effect. excretions/secretions alone did not have any antibacterial effect. the synergism between gentamicin and maggot excretions/secretions could be of direct importance in clinical practice, because it could allow the use of lower doses of gentamicin and thus minimize the risk of gentamicin-related side effects.

TI  == evidence of bacterial biofilms in nasal polyposis.
AB  == introduction: the pathogeny of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (crs/np) has not been elucidated. bacterial exotoxins have been implicated in many inflammatory chronic diseases, such as chronic otitis, chronic tonsillitis,  cholesteatomas, and more recently crs/np. we propose that the bacteria in crs/np  are not only present in a planktonic state, but also occur in microbial communities as biofilms. objective: to determine and characterize the presence of biofilms in crs/np. methods: we performed a prospective study in 12 patients undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery for nasal polyposis. ten patients without crs/np who underwent septoplasty were included as a control group. tissue samples were obtained from the inferior turbinate mucosae. the bacteria were isolated and typified and the material was examined in vitro using a spectrophotometer, and in vivo using optical microscopy and confocal scanning laser microscopy. results: moderate to high in vitro biofilm-forming capacity was detected in 9 out of 12 patients with crs/np (mean [sd] optical density values of between 0.284 [0.017] and 3.337 [0.029]). the microorganisms isolated were staphylococcus (5 patients), streptococcus viridans, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus viridans/corynebacterium. biofilms were demonstrated in vivo in 2 patients and no biofilm structures were evident in any of the controls. conclusion: this study demonstrates the presence of bacterial biofilms in patients with crs/np. this chronic inflammatory factor might contribute to nasal  mucosa damage, increased inflammatory cells in tissue, and the subsequent hyperplasic process.

TI  == synergy of nitric oxide and silver sulfadiazine against gram-negative, gram-positive, and antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
AB  == the synergistic activity between nitric oxide (no) released from diazeniumdiolate-modified proline (proli/no) and silver(i) sulfadiazine (agsd) was evaluated against escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis using a modified broth microdilution technique and a checkerboard-type assay. the combination of no and agsd was defined as synergistic when the fractional bactericidal concentration (fbc) was calculated to be <0.5. gram-negative species were generally more susceptible to the individual antimicrobial agents than the gram-positive bacteria, while gram-positive bacteria were more susceptible to combination therapy. the in vitro synergistic activity of agsd and no observed against a range of pathogens strongly supports future investigation of this therapeutic combination, particularly for its potential use in the treatment of burns and chronic wounds.

TI  == the photodynamic effect: the comparison of chemiexcitation by luminol and phthalhydrazide.
AB  == the presence of light, oxygen and photosensitizer (organic dye) is required for the photodynamic effect. light and photosensitizer are harmless by themselves, but when combined with oxygen, reactive oxygen species (ros) can be produced. this photodynamic effect is used in photodynamic therapy (pdt); the production of ros as lethal cytotoxic agents can inactivate tumor cells. however, during pdt, there are many difficulties, so it is not possible to excite the photosensitizer  using a laser, a source of light at the wavelengths specific to the photosensitizer (in visible region of the spectrum). chemiluminescence is the light emission as a result of a chemical reaction. it is possible to use a chemiluminescent mixture to excite the photosensitizer even if the light emission does not conform to the absorption maximum of the photosensitizer. luciferin and  luminol have been used as chemiluminescent compounds (energizers) for the excitation of the photosensitizers. the aim of this work was to compare the chemiexcitation of some selected photosensitizers (e.g. fluorescein, eosin, methylene blue, hypericin and phthalocyanines) by chemiluminescent mixtures containing luminol (high chemiluminescent quantum yield) or phthalhydrazide (low  chemiluminescent quantum yield) on some gram-positive (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, e. coli) bacteria and some cell lines (nih3t3 and mcf7). the efficiency of the chemiexcitation was dependent on the kind of the photosensitizer and on the type  of the bacterial strain or cell line and was independent of the energizers.

TI  == bacterial contamination of stethoscopes used by health workers: public health implications.
AB  == background: this study was designed to assess both the potential for bacterial transmission by stethoscopes used by health-care workers in nigeria and the implications for patient safety and control of hospital-acquired infections. methodology: a structured questionnaire was administered to health workers and the surface of the diaphragm of their stethoscopes swabbed for bacteriological analysis using standard techniques. results and conclusions: of the 107 stethoscopes surveyed, 84 (79%) were contaminated with bacteria; 59 (81%) of the  contaminated stethoscopes belonged to physicians and 25 (74%) were from other health workers. isolates included staphylococcus aureus (54%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (19%), enterococcus faecalis (14%), and escherichia coli (13%). all stethoscopes that had never been cleaned were contaminated while lower levels of  contamination were found on those cleaned one week or less before the survey (chi(2) = 22.4, p < .05). contamination was significantly higher on stethoscopes  cleaned with only water (100%) compared to those cleaned with alcohol (49%) (chi(2) = 30.17, p < .05). significantly fewer (9%) stethoscopes from health workers who washed their hands after seeing each patient were contaminated when compared with the instruments (86%) of those who did not practice hand washing (chi(2) = 23.79, p < .05). e. coli showed the highest antibiotic resistance, while s. aureus showed the highest antibiotic susceptibility. strict adherence to stethoscope disinfection practices by health workers can minimize cross-contamination and ensure improved patient safety in hospital environments.

TI  == suprathel-acetic acid matrix versus acticoat and aquacel as an antiseptic dressing: an in vitro study.
AB  == background: the treatment of burn wounds is still a challenge regarding the management of antiseptic wound conditioning. especially, in the united states, silver-containing dressings, such as acticoat and aquacel are frequently used. because silver-containing dressings have well-known drawbacks such as an antimicrobial lack against pseudomonas aeruginosa, we sought to develop an alternative dressing method. in previous studies, we could demonstrate the excellent antiseptic properties of acetic acid against common burn unit germs, and in another study, the feasibility and suitability of a suprathel-acetic acid  matrix as an antiseptic dressing. materials and methods: this study was designed  to test the in vitro antimicrobial effect of a suprathel-acetic acid matrix versus acticoat and aquacel. to cover the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria strains were tested: escherichia coli, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-positive klebsiella pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus faecalis, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. results: the tests showed an excellent bactericidal effect of the suprathel-acetic acid matrix particularly with problematic gram-negative bacteria such as proteus vulgaris, p. aeruginosa,  and acinetobacter baumannii. the efficiency was superior to that of acicoat and aquacel. conclusions: our results support the notion, that the suprathel-acetic acid matrix has an excellent bactericidal effect and therefore seems to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent in the treatment of burn wounds.

AB  == the urinary tract is one of the more common sites of bacterial infections, especially in women. urinary infection can be defined as an infection of urinary  tract structures which occurs, generally, as a consequence of the presence or colonization by urine bacteria. the aim of this study was to determine the etiology of urinary tract infections and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents in the region of vale do sousa and tamega. from february 2008 to january 2009, 18653 urine cultures were analyzed. from these cultures 1037 were positive. from this total of positive cultures, 18,3% were from males and 81.7% were from females. in bacteriological positive tests, 23 different strains of microorganisms were found. it was verified that the most frequent microorganism was escherichia coli, followed by proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. for antimicrobial susceptibility it was verified that escherichia coli showed low susceptibility to amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole. proteus mirabilis showed good susceptibility to cefotaxime and low to cotrimoxazole, amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin. for klebsiella pneumoniae was found only a reasonable susceptibility to gentamicin and enterococcus faecalis showed amoxicillin susceptibility. pseudomonas aeruginosa showed low susceptibility to all antibiotics analyzed with the exception of the combination piperacillin/tazobactam. in conclusion, this study shows that escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae are the  three main microorganisms that causes urinary infections in the region of vale do sousa and tamega. therefore, the antimicrobial empirically used must have a spectrum against enterobacteria, because they are the most likely to be present in urinary tract infections acquired in the community. a periodic analysis of the susceptibility profile should be performed over time for each region in order to  help in the beginning of the empirical antimicrobial treatment.

AB  == background: the objective of this study was to perform simulated-use testing as well as a clinical study to assess the efficacy of the evotech endoscope cleaner  and reprocessor (ecr) cleaning for flexible colonoscopes, duodenoscopes, gastroscopes and bronchoscopes. the main aim was to determine if the cleaning achieved using the ecr was at least equivalent to that achieved using optimal manual cleaning. methods: simulated-use testing consisted of inoculating all scope channels and two surface sites with artificial test soil (ats) containing 108 cfu/ml of enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. duodenoscopes, colonoscopes, and bronchoscopes (all olympus endoscopes) were included in the simulated use testing. each endoscope type was tested in triplicate and all channels and two surface sites were sampled for each scope. the clinical study evaluated patient-used duodenoscopes, bronchoscopes, colonoscopes, and gastroscopes (scopes used for emergency procedures were excluded) that had only a bedside flush prior to being processed in the ecr (i.e. no manual cleaning). there were 10 to 15 endoscopes evaluated post-cleaning and to ensure the entire ecr cycle was effective, 5 endoscopes were evaluated post-cleaning and post-high level disinfection. all channels and two external surface locations were sampled to evaluate the residual organic and microbial load. effective cleaning of endoscope surfaces and channels was deemed to have been achieved if there was < 6.4 microg/cm2 of residual protein, < 1.8 microg/cm2 of residual hemoglobin and < 4 log10 viable bacteria/cm2. published data indicate that routine manual cleaning can achieve these endpoints so the ecr cleaning efficacy must meet or exceed these to establish that the ecr cleaning cycle could replace manual cleaning results: in the clinical study 75 patient-used scopes were evaluated post cleaning and 98.8% of surfaces and 99.7% of lumens met or surpassed the cleaning endpoints set for protein, hemoglobin and bioburden residuals. in the simulated-use study 100% of the olympus colonoscopes, duodenoscopes and bronchoscopes evaluated met or surpassed the cleaning endpoints set for protein, and bioburden residuals (hemoglobin was not evaluated). conclusions: the ecr cleaning cycle provides an effective automated approach that ensures surfaces and channels of flexible endoscopes are adequately cleaned after having only a bedside flush but no manual cleaning. it is crucial to note that endoscopes used for emergency procedures or where reprocessing is delayed for more than one hour must still be manually cleaned prior to placing them in the ecr.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal activity of human beta-defensin 2 against nosocomial strains.
AB  == human beta-defensin 2 (hbd-2) is a 41-amino acid cationic peptide of the innate immune system that serves as antimicrobial molecule. we determined the bactericidal activity of synthetic hbd-2 against nosocomial strains belonging to  eight different bacterial species and exhibiting various antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. the native disulfide connectivity was found essential for the bactericidal activity of hbd-2, while sodium chloride concentration was reversely associated with its potency. hbd-2 exhibited high bactericidal activity against acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus clinical strains. characteristically, a. baumannii strains that exhibited multi-drug resistant (mdr) phenotypes were susceptible to lower concentrations of hbd-2 (vld(90)=3.25-4.5 microg/ml) in comparison with non-mdr (wild-type) a. baumannii  strains (vld(90)=3.90-9.35 microg/ml). bactericidal activity of hbd-2 was less pronounced against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis  strains but was significantly enhanced against strains of these species that exhibited resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. these observations give  indications that the natural hbd-2 has a potential therapeutic role against bacterial pathogens and particularly against those exhibiting mdr phenotypes.

TI  == evaluation of the epinecidin-1 peptide as an active ingredient in cleaning solutions against pathogens.
AB  == we tested the activity of epinecidin-1, a novel antimicrobial peptide structurally related to pleurocidin, in commercial cleaning solutions stored at 4 and 25 degrees c for 7 and 14 days. the peptide's activities against enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, propionibacterium acnes, and candida albicans were measured in a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) determination, minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) determination, disk diffusion test, and a count  of the bacterial numbers. exposure to epinecidn-1 in a cleaning solution following mic value comparisons in the disk diffusion test and counts of bacterial numbers after 16, 24, 48, and 72 h suggested that bacterial numbers were much lower than those treated with only commercial cleaning solutions for all bacteria. the efficacy of the antimicrobial activities of inhibiting bacterial numbers by epinecidin-1 in cleaning solutions at a low ph and a low temperature was not affected. given its simple structure and antimicrobial activity, epinecidin-1 may be a useful component of microbicides designed to prevent pathogen infections and/or remediate abnormal vaginal or skin flora.

TI  == female and male genetic contributions to post-mating immune defence in female drosophila melanogaster.
AB  == post-mating reduction in immune defence is common in female insects, and a trade-off between mating and immunity could affect the evolution of immunity. in  this work, we tested the capacity of virgin and mated female drosophila melanogaster to defend against infection by four bacterial pathogens. we found that female d. melanogaster suffer post-mating immunosuppression in a pathogen-dependent manner. the effect of mating was seen after infection with two bacterial pathogens (providencia rettgeri and providencia alcalifaciens), though  not after infection with two other bacteria (enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa). we then asked whether the evolution of post-mating immunosuppression is primarily a 'female' or 'male' trait by assaying for genetic variation among females for the degree of post-mating immune suppression they experience and among males for the level of post-mating immunosuppression they elicit in their mates. we also assayed for an interaction between male and female genotypes to test the specific hypothesis that the evolution of a trade-off between mating and immune defence in females might be being driven by sexual conflict. we found that females, but not males, harbour significant genetic variation for post-mating immunosuppression, and we did not detect an interaction between female and male genotypes. we thus conclude that post-mating immune depression is predominantly a 'female' trait, and find no evidence that it is evolving under sexual conflict.

TI  == prophylactic cefdinir for pediatric cases of complicated urinary tract infection.
AB  == background: this study evaluated the effect of prophylactic cefdinir (3 mg/kg given once daily) for the prevention of recurrent and complicated urinary tract infections (uti) in pediatric patients. methods: the study included 14 infants who were observed for at least 6 months following the first signs of infection (eight boys, six girls; mean age at admission [+/- sd]: 6.2 [+/- 7.4] months). twelve patients had vesico-ureteric reflux (grade i, two; grade ii, three; grade  iii, six; grade iv, one), and two patients had ureteropelvic junction stenosis. results: no patients discontinued medication due to diarrhea or other adverse drug reactions. the patients had a 6-month recurrence-free rate of 93% (13/14); only one patient had recurrent uti. the mean urinary cefdinir concentration was 16.3 [+/- 11.7]microg/ml; there was considerable variability among individual measurements, even though the samples were collected at similar intervals after drug intake (mean 18.00 [+/- 2.63] h after dose). however, the lowest measured urinary cefdinir concentration (1.16 microg/ml) was sufficient to eradicate escherichia coli, one of the most significant causes of uti. fecal cultures, obtained at monthly clinic visits during the observation period, indicated that the patients' e. coli strains were very sensitive to cefdinir. no patients were infected with pseudomonas aeruginosa or other non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli or fungi. conclusions: these results show that cefdinir given 3 mg/kg once daily is very effective and safe for preventing recurrent complicated uti in infants.

TI  == standardized comparison of antiseptic efficacy of triclosan, pvp-iodine, octenidine dihydrochloride, polyhexanide and chlorhexidine digluconate.
AB  == background: this study presents a comparative investigation of the antimicrobial  efficacy of the antiseptics pvp-iodine, triclosan, chlorhexidine, octenidine and  polyhexanide used for pre-surgical antisepsis and antiseptic treatment of skin, wounds and mucous membranes based on internationally accepted standards. methods: mics and mbcs were determined in accordance with din 58940-7 and 58940-8 using staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus), enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus), streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium perfringens, haemophilus influenzae and candida albicans. the microbicidal efficacy was determined in accordance with din en 1040 and 1275 using s. aureus,  p. aeruginosa and c. albicans. results: for chlorhexidine, octenidine and polyhexanide, mic(48) and mbc(24) ranged from 16 to 32 mg/l. maximum values for triclosan ranged from 256 to 512 mg/l, with an efficacy gap against p. aeruginosa, while the maximum values of pvp-iodine were 1024 mg/l, with a gap against s. pneumoniae. comparing the minimal effective concentrations, octenidine was most effective. after 1 min, only octenidine and pvp-iodine fulfil the requirements for antiseptics. conclusions: tests under standardized and harmonized conditions help to choose the most efficacious agent. when a prolonged contact time is feasible, ranking of agents would be polyhexanide = octenidine >  chlorhexidine > triclosan > pvp-iodine. this is consistent with the recommendations for antisepsis of acute wounds. polyhexanide seems to be preferable for chronic wounds due to its higher tolerability. if an immediate effect is required, ranking would be octenidine = pvp-iodine>> polyhexanide > chlorhexidine > triclosan.

AB  == aims: to test the efficacy of acceptable photoantimicrobial agents against bacterial pathogens implicated in complicated urinary tract infection (uti) in comparison with conventionally employed antibacterials. methods and results: toluidine blue (tb), methylene blue (mb), 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ala), trimethoprim and levofloxacin were employed in the study against the typical uti-implicated pathogens staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and proteus mirabilis. standard bacterial cell culture was used to assay the activity both in the dark and under 660-nm led-illuminated conditions. tb and mb were highly photoactive across the range and exhibited rapid kill rates, their effects being  assayed after 20-min illumination, rather than the 18-h incubation employed with  the other compounds. trimethoprim was inactive against all bacteria except pr. mirabilis, while levofloxacin maintained highly bactericidal activity throughout. ala required high concentrations for effective action but, for porphyrin production in situ, also required an 18-h incubation. conclusions: tb and mb were highly and rapidly photobactericidal in comparison with the remaining agents tested. significance and impact of the study: ubiquitous catheterization of geriatric patients offers a portal for light delivery to the urinary tract. the photoantimicrobial approach thus offers considerable potential.

TI  == pt(ii) and ag(i) complexes with acesulfame: crystal structure and a study of their antitumoral, antimicrobial and antiviral activities.
AB  == two new complexes of platinum(ii) and silver(i) with acesulfame were synthesized. acesulfame is in the anionic form acesulfamate (ace). the structures of both complexes were determined by x-ray crystallography. for k(2)[ptcl(2)(ace)(2)] the platinum atom is coordinated to two cl(-) and two n-acesulfamate atoms forming a  trans-square planar geometry. each k(+) ion interacts with two oxygen atoms of the s(o)(2) group of each acesulfamate. for the polymeric complex [ag(ace)](n) the water molecule bridges between two crystallographic equivalent ag1 atoms which are related each other by a twofold symmetry axis. two ag1 atoms, related to each other by a symmetry centre, make bond contact with two equivalent oxygen  atoms. these bonds give rise to infinite chains along the unit cell diagonal in the ac plane. the in vitro cytotoxic analyses for the platinum complex using hela (human cervix cancer) cells show its low activity when compared to the vehicle-treated cells. the ag(i) complex submitted to in vitro antimycobacterial  tests, using the microplate alamar blue (maba) method, showed a good activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis, responsible for tuberculosis, with a minimal  inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 11.6microm. the ag(i) complex also presented a promising activity against gram negative (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram positive (enterococcus faecalis) microorganisms. the complex k(2)[ptcl(2)(ace)(2)] was also evaluated for antiviral properties against dengue virus type 2 (new guinea c strain) in vero cells and showed a good inhibition of dengue virus type 2 (new guinea c strain) replication at 200microm, when compared to vehicle-treated cells.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-positive bacteria isolated in brazilian hospitals participating in the sentry program (2005-2008).
AB  == we report the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the most frequently isolated gram-positive bacteria in the brazilian hospitals participating in the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program. the strains were consecutively collected (one per patient) between january 2005 and september 2008 and susceptibility tested by reference broth microdilution methods at the jmi laboratories (north liberty, iowa, usa). a total of 3,907 gram-positive cocci were analyzed. the gram-positive organisms most frequently isolated from bloodstream infections were staphylococcus aureus (2,218 strains; 20.2% of total), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; 812 strains [14.7%]), and enterococcus spp. (754 strains; 5.0%). s. aureus ranked first (28.1%) and enterococcus faecalis ranked 7th (4.5%) among cases of skin and soft tissue infections. s. aureus was also the second most frequently isolated pathogen from  patients with lower respiratory tract infections (24.9% of cases) after pseudomonas aeruginosa (30.5%). resistance to oxacillin was observed in 31.0% of  s. aureus and the vast majority of oxacillin-resistant (mrsa) strains were also resistant to clindamycin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. vancomycin, linezolid and daptomycin were all very active against s. aureus strains tested (>99.9-100.0% susceptible), but daptomycin (mic(50), 0.25 g/ml and mic(90), 0.5 g/ml) was four- to eight-fold more potent than vancomycin (mic(50) and mic(90) of 1 g/ml) and linezolid (mic(50), 1 g/ml and mic(90), 2 g/ml). vancomycin resistance increased significantly among enterococci during the study period, but it was restrict to only one medical center until 2007 and emerged in a second medical center in 2008. daptomycin was the most active antimicrobial tested against enterococci in general (100.0% susceptible), followed by linezolid (99.9% susceptible), ampicillin (87.4%) and vancomycin (84.6%). in conclusion, daptomycin and linezolid showed excellent in vitro activity against contemporary  gram-positive organisms (3,907) collected in brazilian hospitals monitored by the sentry program, including mrsa, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and other  multi-drug-resistant organisms. although vancomycin resistance rates in brazil appears to be relatively low compared to those reported in the usa, vre has emerged and rapidly disseminated in some brazilian medical centers.

TI  == effects of biofilm treatments on the multi-species lubbock chronic wound biofilm  model.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the efficacy of several biofilm effectors in inhibiting biofilm formation in an in vitro multi-species chronic wound biofilm model. method: the lubbock chronic wound biofilm (lcwb) model has been described in detail elsewhere. pathogens used in the model are pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus. these are three of the most important species associated with biofilms. here, the model was exposed to the following biofilm effectors: xylitol, salicylic acid, farnesol, erythritol and two proprietary, semi-solid, wound-dressing formulations currently under development (sanguitec gels). results: biofilm formation was completely inhibited in the lcwb model following treatment with 20% xylitol, 10% erythritol, 1,000 microg/ml farnesol, 20mm salicylic acid or 0.1% of either of the two sanguitec gel formulations. salicylic acid specifically inhibited s. aureus (p<0.01) at 10mm and 20mm, consequently increasing the ratios of p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis within the biofilm. xylitol had an increasing inhibitory effect on p. aeruginosa (p<0.01) at all concentrations evaluated. erythritol had an inhibitory effect on p. aeruginosa and s. aureus growth (p<0.01) at over 5% concentrations.  the inhibitory effect of both sanguitec gel formulations was more broadly effective, with an increasingly inhibitory effect on all lcwb species (p<0.01). conclusion: the lcwb model provides a multi-species format with which to evaluate the effect of biofilm effectors on wound flora in a biofilm phenotype. these results suggest that different treatments can target specific populations within  a biofilm. salicylic acid preferentially targeted s. aureus, xylitol preferentially targeted p. aeruginosa, while erythritol preferentially targeted both p. aeruginosa and s. aureus. in contrast, the two sanguitec gel formulations provided a broad, less preferential, inhibition of biofilm development. declaration of interest: research and testing laboratory is a for-profit enterprise that develops molecular methods and performs service research work on  biofilms. sanguitec gel was developed by jpk and cej.

TI  == [recent trend and research issues related to antimicrobial-resistant bacteria].
AB  == the discovery of penicillin in 1928 was followed by the discovery and synthesis of various kinds of antimicrobial agents such as quinolone, aminogycoside, macrolide, tetracyclone, and oxazolidinone. these discoveries dramatically decreased the mortality rate due to infectious diseases. however, bacteria have also acquired antimicrobial-resistance genes or changed their own genes to oppose these antimicrobial agents, and now drug-resistant bacteria are becoming a serious clinical concern. today, contagious diseases must be treated with the limited number of effective antimicrobial agents available. infection control measures are required to prevent the spread of resistant bacteria in the clinical environment, and we must also increase our understanding of the drug-resistant mechanisms of bacteria. in this issue we wish to introduce the recent worldwide trend in antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, especially multidrug-resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, along with recently-discovered antimicrobial-resistant systems.

TI  == chronic suppurative otitis media in cleft palate: microorganism etiology and susceptibilities.
AB  == objective: to investigate the microbial etiology of suppurative chronic otitis media (scom) in patients with complete cleft lip and palate and isolated cleft palate and to determine the sensitivity of isolated microorganisms to antibiotics by drug diffusion from impregnated discs in agar and the minimum inhibitory concentration of each drug to these microorganisms by drug dilution in agar. design/patients: effusion samples of scom obtained from 40 patients with cleft lip and palate registered at the hospital for rehabilitation of craniofacial anomalies, university of sao paulo, at bauru, brazil, were bacteriologically analyzed by cultures. the isolated bacteria were submitted to an in vitro susceptibility test to clinically used drugs. results: positive cultures were obtained in 100% of studied cases. among the 57 strains observed, the most frequent were pseudomonas aeruginosa (35%), staphylococcus aureus (15.5%), enterococcus faecalis (14%), and proteus mirabilis (12%). the frequency of gram-negative bacilli (enterobacteriaceae and nonfermentative bacilli) was 67%. pseudomonas aeruginosa presented the highest sensitivity to ciprofloxacin, and enterobacteriaceae exhibited the highest sensitivity to gentamicin. the strains of s. aureus and e. faecalis presented the highest sensitivity to imipenem and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, respectively. conclusion: patients with cleft lip  and palate presenting with scom exhibited 100% positive cultures, with the highest frequency of pseudomonas and enterobacteriaceae. with regard to the action of antibiotics, imipenem was effective against the four species of isolated microorganisms, followed by ciprofloxacin, which was effective against 75% of isolated species.

TI  == marked hydronephrosis and hydroureter after distigmine therapy in an adult male patient with paraplegia due to spinal cord injury: a case report.
AB  == introduction: distigmine, a long-acting anti-cholinesterase, is associated with side effects such as parkinsonism, cholinergic crisis, and rhabdomyolysis. we report a spinal cord injury patient, who developed marked hydronephrosis and hydroureter after distigmine therapy, which led to a series of complications over subsequent years. case presentation: a 38-year-old male developed t-9 paraplegia  in 1989. intravenous urography, performed in 1989, showed normal kidneys, ureters and bladder. he was prescribed distigmine bromide orally and was allowed to pass  urine spontaneously. in 1992, intravenous urography showed bilateral marked hydronephrosis and hydroureter. distigmine was discontinued. he continued to pass urine spontaneously. in 2006, intravenous urography showed moderate dilatation of both pelvicalyceal systems and ureters down to the level of urinary bladder. this patient was performing self-catheterisation only once a day. he was advised to do catheterisations at least three times a day. in december 2008, this patient developed haematuriawhich lasted for nearly four months.. he received trimethoprim, then cephalexin, followed by macrodantin, amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin. in february 2009, intravenous urography showed calculus at the lower pole of left kidney. both kidneys were moderately hydronephrotic. ureters were dilated down to the bladder. dilute contrast was seen in the bladder due to  residual urine. this patient was advised to perform six catheterisations a day, and take propiverine hydrochloride 15 mg, three times a day. microbiology of urine showed klebsiella oxytoca, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococcus faecalis. cystoscopy revealed papillary lesions in bladder neck and trigone. transurethral resection was performed. histology showed marked chronic cystitis including follicular cystitis and papillary/polypoid cystitis. there was no evidence of malignancy. conclusion: distigmine therapy resulted in marked bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureter. persistence of hydronephrosis after omitting distigmine, and presence of residual urine in bladder over many years probably predisposed to formation of polypoid cystitis and follicular cystitis, and contributed to prolonged haematuria, which occurred after an episode of urine infection. this case illustrates the dangers of prescribing distigmine to promote spontaneous voiding in spinal cord injury patients. instead of using distigmine,  spinal cord injury patients should be advised to consider intermittent catheterisation together with oxybutynin or propiverine to achieve complete, low-pressure emptying of urinary bladder.

TI  == isolation and activity of two antibacterial biflavonoids from leaf extracts of garcinia livingstonei (clusiaceae).
AB  == the antibacterial activity of the acetone extract of garcinia livingstonei leaves was studied using bioautography and by determining the minimum antibacterial concentration against four nosocomial pathogens. bioautograms showed that two compounds were mainly responsible for the antibacterial activity. these were isolated by a combination of solvent-solvent fractionation and bioassay-guided chromatographic fractionation and were characterized by 1h nmr, 13c nmr and 2d nmr spectroscopy as amentoflavone and 4"-methoxy amentoflavone. the antibacterial activity of the isolated compounds was determined against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. three of the tested organisms were sensitive to both compounds with mic values ranging from 8-100 microg/ml. p. aeruginosa was resistant with mics > 100 microg/ml. the  safety of the two compounds was assessed with a tetrazolium based colorimetric assay (mtt assay) using vero monkey kidney cells. the compounds had low toxicity  against the cell line with cytotoxic concentrations to 50% of the cells (ld50) of 386 microg/ml and > 600 microg/ml for amentoflavone and 4"-methoxy amentoflavone, respectively. berberine, the positive control had a cc50 of 170 microg/ml. 4"-methoxy amentoflavone was more active and much less toxic than amentoflavone.

TI  == c-reactive protein and interleukin-6 responses for differentiating fungal and bacterial aetiology in late-onset neonatal sepsis.
AB  == fungal infections are increasingly frequent causes of neonatal sepsis (ns). this  study examined the predictive value of the combined evaluation of the c-reactive  protein (crp) and interleukin-6 (il-6) responses for differentiating fungal and bacterial aetiologies in patients with ns. from january to september 2007, neonates who were diagnosed with ns and had their crp and il-6 levels measured were selected. based on their blood culture results, the neonates were divided into two groups: group of fungal sepsis (fs) and group of bacterial sepsis (bs).  fs included 14 candida albicans and one non-albicans candida isolates and bs included five klebsiella pneumoniae, three pseudomonas aeruginosa, three enterococcus faecalis, two coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, one enterococcus faecium and one acinetobacter species. significant differences were  observed in the crp (fs vs. bs: 28.10 +/- 11.03 vs. 11.39 +/- 2.94 mg l(-1), p =  0.026) and il-6 (fs vs. bs: 38.60 +/- 24.24 vs. 392.82 +/- 102.46 ng l(-1), p = 0.000) levels between groups. the combined evaluation of the crp and il-6 responses better predicted the causative micro-organism in ns.

TI  == [in vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,919 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2007].
AB  == we have reported in this journal in vitro susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics every year since 1992. in this paper, we report the results of an  analysis of in vitro susceptibilities of 12,919 clinical isolates from 72 centers in japan to selected antibiotics in 2007 compared with the results from previous  years. the common respiratory pathogens, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae maintained a high susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (fqs). the resistance of s. pyogenes to macrolides has been increasing every year and this was especially clear this year. most strains of enterobacteriaceae except for escherichia coli showed a high susceptibility to fqs. almost 30% of e. coli strains were resistant to fqs and the resistance increased further this year. fqs resistance of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was approximately 95% with the exception of 45% for sitafloxacin (stfx). fqs resistance of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) was low at about 10%. fqs resistance of  methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci (mrcns) was higher than that of methicillin-susceptible coagulase negative staphylococci (mscns), but it  was lower than that of mrsa. however, fqs resistance of mscns was higher than that of mssa. fqs resistance of enterococcus faecalis was 22.5% to 29.6%, while that of enterococcusfaecium was more than 85% except for stfx (58.3%). in clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa derived from urinary tract infections, fqs resistance was 21-27%, which was higher than that of p. aeruginosa from respiratory tract infections at 13-21%, which was the same trend  as in past years. multidrug resistant strains accounted for 5.6% in the urinary tract and 1.8% in the respiratory tract. acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to fqs. the carbapenem resistant strains, which present a problem  at present, accounted for 2.7%. neisseria gonorrhoeae showed high resistance of 86-88% to fqs. the results of the present survey indicated that although methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococci, e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and n.  gonorrhoeae showed resistance tendencies, and other species maintained high susceptibility rates more than 90% against fqs, which have been used clinically for over 15 years.

TI  == propagation of anaerobic bacteria within an aerobic multi-species chronic wound biofilm model.
AB  == objective: most chronic wound biofilms have been shown to have significant populations of anaerobes. in order to better screen antimicrobial and antibiofilm therapeutics, we evaluated the ability of key anaerobes to incorporate and propagate within our aerobic chronic wound biofilm. method: we had previously developed a rapid model to simulate polymicrobial chronic wound biofilms. this model incorporated meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre) and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the  model was used along with a variety of anaerobes to determine whether this biofilm model would support propagation of anaerobes similar to that we have identified in chronic wounds. results: using our previously defined lubbock chronic wound biofilm (lcwb) model combined with quantitative pcr, anaerobic bacteria were shown to proliferate through integration into the biofilm under aerobic conditions. using electron microscopy we show close association between aerobes and anaerobes within the biofilm suggesting a synergistic relationship. conclusion: we have expanded the utility of the lcbw to show the ability of clinically significant anaerobic bacteria to thrive in aerobic conditions. the expansion of this model can further simulate the functional characteristics of chronic wound pathogenic biofilms and the species that dwell within them allowing improved ability to evaluate therapeutics that target anaerobes.

TI  == comparative analysis of the virulence of invertebrate and mammalian pathogenic bacteria in the oral insect infection model galleria mellonella.
AB  == infection of galleria mellonella by feeding a mixture of bacillus thuringiensis spores or vegetative bacteria in association with the toxin cry1c results in high levels of larval mortality. under these conditions the toxin or bacteria have minimal effects on the larva when inoculated separately. in order to evaluate whether g. mellonella can function as an oral infection model for human and entomo-bacterial pathogens, we tested strains of bacillus cereus, bacillus anthracis, enterococcus faecalis, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa  and a drosophila targeting pseudomonas entomophila strain. six b. cereus strains  (5 diarrheal, 1 environmental isolate) were first screened in 2nd instar g. mellonella larvae by free ingestion and four of them were analyzed by force-feeding 5th instar larvae. the virulence of these b. cereus strains did not differ from the b. thuringiensis virulent reference strain 407cry(-) with the exception of strain d19 (nvh391/98) that showed a lower virulence. following force-feeding, 5th instar g. mellonella larvae survived infection with b. anthracis, l. monocytogenes, e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa strains in contrast to the p. entomophila strain which led to high mortality even without cry1c toxin co-ingestion. thus, specific virulence factors adapted to the insect intestine might exist in b. thuringiensis/b. cereus and p. entomophila. this suggests a co-evolution between host and pathogens and supports the close links between b. thuringiensis and b. cereus and more distant links to their relative b. anthracis.

TI  == is there an association between nosocomial infection rates and bacterial cross transmissions?
AB  == objective: surveillance data of nosocomial infection rates are increasingly used  for public reporting and interhospital comparisons. approximately 15% of nosocomial infections on intensive care units are the result of patient-to-patient transmissions of the causative organisms. these exogenous infections could be prevented by adherence to basic infection control measures. the association between bacterial cross transmissions and nosocomial infection rates was analyzed. design: prospective cohort study during 24 months. setting: eleven intensive care units from two university hospitals. patients: all inpatients. interventions: none. measurements and main results: primary isolates  of six indicator organisms (acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus) cultured from clinical samples or methicillin-resistant s. aureus surveillance testing of all inpatients were genotyped. indistinguishable isolates in > or =2 patients defined potential episodes of transmissions. surveillance of nosocomial  infection rates was performed according to the german nosocomial infection surveillance system, krankenhaus infektions surveillance system. transmission events and nosocomial infection rates were pooled by intensive care unit to calculate spearman's rank-correlation test. during 100,781 patient days, 100,829  microbiological specimens from 24,362 patients were sampled (average investigation density: 1.0 sample per patient and day) and 3419 primary indicator organisms were cultured. altogether, 462 transmissions (incidence density of 4.6  transmissions per 1000 patient days; range, 1.4-8.4 days) and 1216 nosocomial infections (incidence density of 12.1 per 1000 patient days; range, 6.2-16.6 days) were discerned. correlation analysis was unable to reveal any association between the incidence of cross transmissions and nosocomial infections, duration  of hospitalization, or device use. conclusions: differences in nosocomial infection rates between study intensive care units are not explained solely by cross transmissions. other factors, like the severity of the patient's underlying diseases, the patient's endogenous flora, or invasive procedures, likely have a dominant effect on the magnitude of nosocomial infection rates.

TI  == aryl rhodanines specifically inhibit staphylococcal and enterococcal biofilm formation.
AB  == staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus are the leading causative agents of indwelling medical device infections because of their ability to form biofilms on artificial surfaces. here we describe the antibiofilm activity of a class of small molecules, the aryl rhodanines, which specifically inhibit biofilm formation of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and e. gallinarum but not the gram-negative species pseudomonas aeruginosa or escherichia coli. the aryl rhodanines do not exhibit antibacterial activity against any of the bacterial strains tested and are not cytotoxic against hela cells. preliminary mechanism-of-action studies revealed that the aryl rhodanines  specifically inhibit the early stages of biofilm development by preventing attachment of the bacteria to surfaces.

TI  == detection of helicobacter pylori, enterococcus faecalis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the subgingival biofilm of hiv-infected subjects undergoing haart with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == this study compared the frequency of helicobacter pylori, enterococcus faecalis,  and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the subgingival microbiota of hiv-seropositive and  hiv-seronegative subjects with periodontitis or clinically healthy periodontal tissues. fifty-four subjects were distributed into two hiv-seropositive groups (chronic periodontitis [hcp = 13] and periodontal health [hh = 10]) and two hiv-seronegative groups (chronic periodontitis [cp = 17] and periodontal health [h = 14]). the detection of bacterial species was carried out by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). cp patients showed significantly more periodontal destruction, inflammation, and supragingival plaque than hcp patients (p < 0.05). all species  were detected at a higher prevalence in cp and hcp than h individuals (p < 0.01). in the hiv groups, h. pylori was significantly more prevalent in periodontitis compared to healthy patients (p < 0.01). a higher frequency of e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa was observed in the subgingival biofilm of hh than h subjects (p < 0.01). moreover, e. faecalis was detected significantly more often in hiv-seropositive compared to hiv-seronegative patients, regardless of periodontal status (p < 0.01). these data indicate that h. pylori is frequently detected in the subgingival microbiota of periodontitis subjects. in contrast, hiv-seropositive patients with either periodontitis or periodontal health present a high prevalence of e. faecalis.

TI  == uropathogen interaction with the surface of urological stents using different surface properties.
AB  == purpose: ureteral stents commonly become infected or encrusted. various coatings  have been developed to decrease bacterial adherence. to our knowledge there has been no in vitro testing of coating with heparin to date. we determined the effects of heparin coating on bacterial adherence of common uropathogens and physical stent properties. materials and methods: heparin coated radiance ureteral stents (cook) and noncoated endo-sof control stents were tested against  triclosan eluting triumph(r) stents and noneluting polaris control stents for adherence of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa for 7 days. adherent bacteria were determined and biofilms were visualized using fluorescent dyes. radial, tensile and coil strength of the radiance and polaris stents was compared to determine the effect of heparin coating on physical stent characteristics. results: heparin coating did not decrease bacterial adhesion compared to its control. e. coli adhesion was limited by all stents tested. the polaris stent showed significantly greater resistance to bacterial adherence for klebsiella, pseudomonas and enterococcus than the endo-sof and radiance stents but was more susceptible to s. aureus adherence. the triumph stent resisted all bacteria except pseudomonas and enterococcus. mature biofilms were observed on all stents  with lower viability on the triumph stent. radiance stents showed higher tensile  and lower compression strength than its control. conclusions: heparin coating does not decrease bacterial adherence to ureteral stents. drug eluting antimicrobials have an inhibitory effect on bacterial adherence and the polaris stent showed the least bacterial adherence of the nondrug eluting ureteral stents tested.

TI  == ceftobiprole: a new broad spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  == ceftobiprole, formerly designated bal9141/ro 63-9141, is a pyrrolidinone-3-ylidene-methyl cephalosporin with demonstrated in vitro activity  against mrsa, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. ceftobiprole has a low potential for inducing chromosomal ampc beta-lactamases but it is hydrolyzed by most extended spectrum beta-lactamases and metallo-beta-lactamases. glomerular filtration is predominantly responsible for removal of the free drug from the systemic circulation. the efficacy of ceftobiprole in the treatment of complicated skin and ski-structure infections has been recently demonstrated in two phase iii randomized clinical trials involving 1600 patients. two other phase iii clinical trials to assess ceftobiprole's efficacy in community-acquired pneumonia and nosocomial pneumonia  have also concluded. while the drug met the noninferiority criteria for community-acquired pneumonia and nosocomial pneumonia involving non-ventilator associated pneumonia, ceftobiprole was less effective than the comparator in ventilator associated pneumonia subjects. ceftobiprole was well tolerated with a  safety profile consistent with the cephalosporin class of antibiotic. the most frequent drug-related adverse event was dysgeusia. ceftobiprole is intended for use in the hospital for the treatment of infections that frequently involve beta-lactam-resistant gram-negative and gram-positive organisms.

TI  == modeling microbial survival in buildup biofilm for complex medical devices.
AB  == background: flexible endoscopes undergo repeated rounds of patient-use and reprocessing. some evidence indicates that there is an accumulation or build-up of organic material that occurs over time in endoscope channels. this "buildup biofilm" (bbf) develops as a result of cyclical exposure to wet and dry phases during usage and reprocessing. this study investigated whether the bbf matrix represents a greater challenge to disinfectant efficacy and microbial eradication than traditional biofilm (tbf), which forms when a surface is constantly bathed in fluid. methods: using the mbec (minimum biofilm eradication concentration) system, a unique modelling approach was developed to evaluate microbial survival  in bbf formed by repetitive cycles of drying, disinfectant exposure and re-exposure to the test organism. this model mimics the cumulative effect of the  reprocessing protocol on flexible endoscopes. glutaraldehyde (glut) and accelerated hydrogen peroxide (ahp) were evaluated to assess the killing of microbes in tbf and bbf. results: the data showed that the combination of an organic matrix and aldehyde disinfection quickly produced a protective bbf that facilitated high levels of organism survival. in cross-linked bbf formed under high nutrient conditions the maximum colony forming units (cfu) reached ~6 log(10)cfu/peg. however, if an oxidizing agent was used for disinfection and if organic levels were kept low, organism survival did not occur. a key finding was  that once established, the microbial load of bbf formed by glut exposure had a faster rate of accumulation than in tbf. the rate of biofilm survival post high-level disinfection (hld) determined by the maximum log(10)cfu/initial log(10)cfu for e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa in bbf was 10 and 8.6 respectively;  significantly different compared to a survival rate in tbf of ~2 for each organism. data from indirect outgrowth testing demonstrated for the first time that there is organism survival in the matrix. both tbf and bbf had surviving organisms when glut was used. for ahp survival was seen less frequently in bbf than in tbf. conclusion: this bbf model demonstrated for the first time that survival of a wide range of microorganisms does occur in bbf, with significantly  more rapid outgrowth compared to tbf. this is most pronounced when glut is used compared to ahp. the data supports the need for meticulous cleaning of reprocessed endoscopes since the presence of organic material and microorganisms  prevents effective disinfection when glut and ahp are used. however, cross-linking agents like glut are not as effective when there is bbf. the data from the mbec model of bbf suggest that for flexible endoscopes that are repeatedly used and reprocessed, the assurance of effective high-level disinfection may decrease if bbf develops within the channels.

AB  == a new type of nanobiodetector based on a limited number of polyaniline nanofibrils has been designed and tested against bacteria klebsiella pneumoniae,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis. the cells attaching conducting nanofibrils modify locally the electrical conductivity making the polymer nanowires electrically inhomogeneous. the "defects" accumulate in nanofibrils changing suddenly their electrical conductivity above a threshold  density (the percolation limit), enabling an easy flow of the charge carriers. the results are unique: the device works like an "on-off" switch with nearly linear response above a threshold number of cells in the suspension examined, which is of an order of 10(5) to 10(6) cfu per 1 ml. such a behaviour is important for bio-alarm systems, environmental monitoring and medical applications.

TI  == antibacterial activity and essential oil composition of satureja spicigera from iran.
AB  == the aerial parts of satureja spicigera were collected at full flowering stage at  gazvin, iran. the essential oil was isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by a combination of capillary gc and gc-ms. fourteen compounds were identified, of which carvacrol (53.74%) and thymol (36.03%) were the main constituents, representing 99.12% of the total oil. the in vitro antibacterial activity of the  essential oil was determined against six atcc standard bacterial strains (bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa) using disc diffusion as well as measurement of minimum inhibitory concentrations. the disc diffusion results and mic values indicated high inhibitory activity against the test bacteria. the most susceptible organisms were the gram-positive b. subtilis and s. aureus followed by e. faecalis, usually resistant to most common antibiotics.  among the gram-negative bacteria, e. coli and k. pneumoniae were highly sensitive to the different oil concentrations in the disc diffusion method. finally, p. aeruginosa, a highly resistant organism to most antibiotics, showed moderate susceptibility to satureja spicigera essential oil.

TI  == characterization of the beneficial properties of lactobacilli isolated from bullfrog (rana catesbeiana) hatchery.
AB  == the present work addresses the isolation and partial identification of the microbial population of a r. catesbeiana hatchery in spring and summer as well as some beneficial properties of lactobacillus strains isolated in different seasons and hatchery areas. the bacterial population was grouped into the following taxa: lactobacillus spp., pediococcus spp., enterococcus faecalis and ent. faecium, and enterobacteriaceae (enterobacter spp., escherichia coli) while pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis were isolated from frogs displaying red-leg syndrome. the lactobacillus plantarum and l. curvatus strains isolated showed to inhibit the growth of red-leg syndrome associated pathogens and food-borne bacteria by organic acids. while l. plantarum crl 1606 also inhibited  red-leg syndrome related pathogens by hydrogen peroxide, meat spoilage bacteria were only inhibited by acidity. however, by using a mrs medium added with tetramethyl-benzidine and peroxidase, a high percentage of h(2)o(2)-producing lactobacilli were detected. the surface properties of lactobacillus strains showed that a few strains were able to agglutinate abo human erythrocytes, while  the highest number of strains had a low to medium degree of hydrophobicity. this  paper constitute the first study related to the beneficial properties of lactobacillus isolated from a bullfrog hatchery, as well as the selection criteria applied to a group of strains, which could help to control or prevent bacterial infectious diseases in raniculture.

TI  == leptoglycin: a new glycine/leucine-rich antimicrobial peptide isolated from the skin secretion of the south american frog leptodactylus pentadactylus (leptodactylidae).
AB  == antimicrobial peptides are components of innate immunity that is the first-line defense against invading pathogens for a wide range of organisms. here, we describe the isolation, biological characterization and amino acid sequencing of  a novel neutral glycine/leucine-rich antimicrobial peptide from skin secretion of leptodactylus pentadactylus named leptoglycin. the amino acid sequence of the peptide purified by rp-hplc (c(18) column) was deduced by mass spectrometric de novo sequencing and confirmed by edman degradation: gllggllgpllgggggggggll. leptoglycin was able to inhibit the growth of gram-negative bacteria pseudomonas  aeruginosa, escherichia coli and citrobacter freundii with minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 8 microm, 50 microm, and 75 microm respectively, but it  did not show antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus and enterococcus faecalis), yeasts (candida albicans and candida tropicalis) and dermatophytes fungi (microsporum canis and trichophyton rubrum). no hemolytic activity was observed at the 2-200 microm range concentration. the amino acid sequence of leptoglycin with high level of glycine (59.1%) and leucine (36.4%) containing an unusual central proline suggests the existence of a new class of gly/leu-rich antimicrobial peptides. taken together, these results suggest that this natural antimicrobial peptide could be a tool to develop new antibiotics.

TI  == biofilm evidence and the microbial diversity of horse wounds.
AB  == evidence of biofilms in human chronic wounds are thought to be responsible for preventing healing in a timely manner. however, biofilm evidence in horse wounds  has not yet been documented. consequently, this study aimed to determine whether  biofilms could be detected in wounds, and to investigate the microbiology of chronic wounds in horses. prior to analysis, wound surfaces were irrigated with 5 ml of sterile saline to remove debris. all wounds were swabbed twice (1 cm2 area) using sterile cotton-tipped swabs. in addition to this, 2 tissue biopsies were taken to investigate evidence of biofilm and the microbiology richness of the wounds. all swabs and 1 biopsy sample were transported to the laboratory in robertson's cooked meat broth. traditional culturable techniques and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis with pcr were utilized to identify common bacteria isolated in all wounds. following analysis of a number of the biopsy samples, biofilms could be clearly seen. the most common bacteria isolated from each wound analysed included pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, enterococcus faecalis, and providencia rettgeri. sequencing of the 16s ribosmonal dnas, selected on the basis of dgge profiling, enabled identification of bacterial species not identified using culturable technology. this study is the first to identify biofilms in the chronic wounds of horses. in  addition, this study also demonstrated the importance of combining dgge-pcr with  culture techniques to provide better microbiology analysis of chronic wounds.

TI  == the antimicrobial effect of acetic acid--an alternative to common local antiseptics?
AB  == acetic acid has been commonly used in medicine for more than 6000 years for the disinfection of wounds and especially as an antiseptic agent in the treatment and prophylaxis of the plague. the main goal of this study was to prove the suitability of acetic acid, in low concentration of 3%, as a local antiseptic agent, especially for use in salvage procedures in problematic infections caused  by organisms such as proteus vulgaris, acinetobacter baumannii or pseudomonas aeruginosa. this study was designed to compare the in vitro antimicrobial effect  of acetic acid with those of common local antiseptics such as povidone-iodine 11% (betaisodona), polyhexanide 0.04% (lavasept), mafenide 5% and chlohexidine gluconate 1.5% cetrimide 15% (hibicet). former studies suggest the bactericidal effect of acetic acid, but these data are very heterogeneous; therefore, a standardised in vitro study was conducted. to cover the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial  strains were tested: escherichia coli, p. vulgaris, p. aeruginosa, a. baumannii,  enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and beta-haemolytic streptococcus group a and b. the tests showed excellent bactericidal effect of acetic acid, particularly with problematic gram-negative bacteria such as p. vulgaris, p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii. the microbiological spectrum of acetic acid is wide, even when tested  at a low concentration of 3%. in comparison to our currently used antiseptic solutions, it showed similar - in some bacteria, even better - bactericidal properties. an evaluation of the clinical value of topical application of acetic  acid is currently underway. it can be concluded that acetic acid in a concentration of 3% has excellent bactericidal effect and, therefore, seems to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but further clinical studies are necessary.

TI  == catheter-related urinary tract infection in patients suffering from spinal cord injuries.
AB  == urinary tract infection is commoner in patients with spinal cord injuries because of incomplete bladder emptying and the use of catheters that can result in the introduction of bacteria into the bladder. 145 patients suffering from spinal cord injuries, admitted to the institute for physical medicine and rehabilitation, centre for paraplegia of the clinical centre of the university of sarajevo, were included. the patients were divided in three groups according to the method of bladder drainage: group a (n=61) consisted of patients on clean intermittent catheterization; group b (n=54) consisted of patients with indwelling catheters; group c (n=30) consisted of patients who had performed self-catheterization. from a total of 4539 urine samples, 3963 (87,3%) were positive and 576 (12,7%) were sterile. more than 90% of the infected patients were asymptomatic. the overall rate of urinary infection amounted to about 2,1 episodes, and bacteriuria to 8,1 episodes per patient. 77% of infections (113/145) were acquired within seven days from catheterization. infection was usually polymicrobial; the greatest number of urine samples 1770/3943 (44,9%) included more than one bacterium. the vast majority of cases of urinary tract infection and bacteriuria are caused by gram-negative bacilli and enterococci, commensal organisms of the bowel and perineum, representative of those from the hospital environment. providencia stuarti (18,9%) being the most common, followed by proteus mirabilis (16,3%), escherichia coli (11,8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10,2%), klebsiella pneumoniae (8,1%), morganella morgani (5,4%), acinetobacter baumannii (4,6%), providencia rettgeri (3,5%). 15,7% of isolates were gram-positive with enterococcus faecalis (8,6%) as the most common. 55,3% of isolates were multidrug-resistant, and the highest rates of resistance were found among acinetobacter baumannii (87,8%), providencia rettgeri (86,7%), pseudomonas  aeruginosa (85,4%), providencia stuarti (84,3%) and morganella morgani (81,0%). lower rates of resistance were found in group c, i.e. patients on intermittent self-catheterisation. eradication of organisms was achieved in only 53 (10,05%) of patients; hence, antibiotic therapy had no or very low effect. significant correlations were found between the method of catheterization and the frequency of bacteriuria and urinary tract infections. the analysis of group c showed a rate of lower urinary tract infection and bacteriuria than the other two groups of patients. the objective of this study is the update of etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility in urinary tract infections in this group of patients. in addition, possible correlations between uti and the type of bladder  management were examined.

TI  == clinical investigation of isolated bacteria from urinary tracts of hospitalized patients and their susceptibilities to antibiotics.
AB  == complicated urinary tract infections (utis) are often difficult to treat, partly  because of the existence of isolated antibiotic-resistant strains. even though the definition of uti is determined by the quantity of cultured bacteria, it has  been unclear if the quantity of cultured uti bacteria affects their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. also, the gram stain is generally performed to assume the causative bacteria and their quantity before culture results can be obtained; therefore, we could start to use effective antibiotics if the relationship between bacterial quantity and resistance to antimicrobial agents were clear. we studied patients diagnosed as having complicated utis at the urological department in kobe university hospital between june 2002 and march 2003 and analyzed the relationships between the quantity of cultured bacteria and their antimicrobial mics for antibiotics. the most commonly isolated bacteria were serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. there was no significant correlation between the quantity of cultured bacteria and antimicrobial mics in all the bacteria and antibiotics that we tested, suggesting that resistant phenotype, but not inoculum of the organism, did determine resistance to antibiotics. in conclusion, our investigation suggested the total number of isolated bacteria in  urine culture did not determine the mics and that inoculum of the bacteria might  be important for this determination.

TI  == 1h-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for identifying and quantifying common uropathogens: a metabolic approach to the urinary tract infection.
AB  == objective: to address the shortcomings of urine culture for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (uti), we used 1h-nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy for identifying and quantifying escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia and proteus mirabilis. patients, subjects and methods: urine samples from patients with suspected uti (617), healthy volunteers (50) and commercially available standard strains of e. coli, k. pneumonia, p. aeruginosa, enterobacter, acinobacter, pr. mirabilis, citrobacter frundii, streptococcus saprophyticus and enterococcus faecalis were assessed between 2003  and 2006. 1h-nmr spectra were recorded on a 400 mhz spectrophotometer; to quantify the bacteria we estimated the areas under the spectral peaks of the specific metabolic product compared with the known concentration of trimethyl silyl propionic acid. all urine specimens were cultured in addition to an assessment by nmr spectroscopy. results: preliminary urinary spectroscopy of the  unprocessed samples showed peaks of nonspecific metabolites such as succinate, acetate, lactate and ethanol, indicating infected samples. based on the results from processed samples, 93% (240/256) of e. coli, 92% (101/110) of k. pneumoniae, 93% (56/60) of p. aeruginosa and eight of 10 pr. mirabilis could be diagnosed with nmr (numerator) and urine culture (denominator). the remaining samples were  sterile and/or had a bacterial population of <10(3) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. the nmr method diagnosed bacterial densities of >10(3) cfu. conclusions: the identification of the common uropathogens e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa and pr. mirabilis by nmr spectroscopy has a shorter reporting time and can be used to differentiate between infected, contaminated and sterile specimens.

TI  == biological activity evaluation of the oils from laurus nobilis of tunisia and algeria extracted by supercritical carbon dioxide.
AB  == isolation of essential oil from dried and ground leaves of laurus nobilis l. from algeria and tunisia were obtained with two different methods: by means of classical hydrodistillation (hd) and by using carbon dioxide in the supercritical state (sfe). the effect of extraction pressure on the yield and composition of the l. nobilis volatile oil is examined. the best extraction conditions were as follows: pressure, 9.0 mpa; temperature, 323.15 k; 4 h of extraction and carbon dioxide flow, phi = 1.2 kg h(-1). waxes were entrapped in the first separator set at 9.0 mpa and 263.15 k. the oil was recovered in the second separator working at 2.0 bar and 288.15 k. gc/ms analysis of the leaves' volatile oil revealed that it mainly consisted of: 1,8-cineole, linalool, alpha-terpinyl acetate, methyl eugenol and sabinene. the comparison with the hydrodistilled oil did not reveal any big difference. the collection of samples at different extraction times during supercritical extraction allowed us to monitor the change of the oil composition. on the matrice exhaust owing to a sfe at 9.0 mpa, one further extraction at 323.15 k and 24.0 mpa was performed to obtain a mixture of compounds with higher molecular weight. finally, the antibacterial and antifungal activity of the various extracts has been assayed.

TI  == potential pathogens and effective disinfectants on public telephones at a large urban united states university.
AB  == telephones can carry potential bacterial pathogens, posing a risk for transfer of pathogens to users' hands. this study examined 25 mouthpieces of public telephones at a large urban u.s. university located in an area of rising incidence of community-acquired staphylococcal infections. coagaulase-negative staphylococci were most commonly isolated (64% of mouthpieces). potential pathogens isolated included staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus, and klebsiella ozaenae. the efficacy of disinfectants on reducing bacterial counts on telephone mouthpieces was also investigated. staphyloccocus aurens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococcusfaecalis were inoculated onto mouthpieces and challenged with disinfectant wipes. bacterial counts were reduced substantially for all three organisms by wipes containing either 70% isopropyl alcohol, 1.84% sodium hypochlorite, or quaternary ammonium compounds. the sodium  hypochlorite-based cleaner demonstrated 100% efficacy at removing or killing test organisms from telephone mouthpieces. these data suggest that tested cleaners may be appropriate and needed for public telephone disinfection.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bacterial pathogens causing urinary tract infections in a saudi arabian hospital.
AB  == the study describes the pathogens causing urinary tract infections (uti) and the  antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of health care-associated (hca) and community-acquired (ca) isolates. of the total of 3,989 nonrepetitive urinary cultures, 4.7% (n=188) were hca and 95.3% (n=3,801) were ca isolates. gram-negative organisms totaled 3,607 (90.4%) vs. 9.6% gram-positive organisms. in ca-uti, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis constituted 66, 11.4, and 5.4%, respectively. hca-uti episodes were caused by e.  coli (37.8%), k. pneumoniae (14.4%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.4%). the susceptibility rates of e. coli to ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (tmp-smx), nitrofurantoin and ceftriaxone in hca and ca isolates were 53.3 and 74.1%, 42.2 and 62.7%, 32.5 and 97.0%, and 62.3 and 92.7%, respectively. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production was detected in 8.1 and 7.4% isolates, respectively, of ca and hca isolates of e. coli. ca isolates of k. pneumoniae were more susceptible to tmp-smx (89.2 vs. 60.4%), ciprofloxacin (92.6 vs. 67.9%) and cefuroxime (93.8 vs. 24.5%) than hca isolates. the susceptibility  of hca and ca isolates of e. faecalis to penicillin g and nitrofurantoin were 34.8 and 80%, and 78.3 and 93.6%, respectively (p<0.001). in conclusion, antimicrobial resistance is high to commonly used oral agents, rendering them inappropriate for empirical use.

TI  == the impact of noncontact, nonthermal, low-frequency ultrasound on bacterial counts in experimental and chronic wounds.
AB  == preventing wound infection and the development of resistant bacteria are important concerns in wound management. to determine if noncontact, nonthermal, low-frequency ultrasound therapy is effective in controlling wound bacterial colony counts, a series of four related experiments was conducted. first, ultrasound penetration in both wounded and intact skin was assessed in vitro. compared to sham, noncontact ultrasound penetrated farther into both wounded (3 mm to 3.5 mm versus 0.35 mm to 0.50 mm) and intact (2.0 mm to 2.5 mm versus 0.05  mm to 0.07 mm, respectively) pig skin. second, using an in vitro model to stain and count live/dead bacteria, 0% of sham treated and 33% of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 40% of escherichia coli and 27% of enterococcus faecalis were dead after one ultrasound application. minimal effects on methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and s. aureus were observed. third, using an in vivo model, after 1 week, while differences between different bacterial species were observed, overall bacterial quantity decreased with ultrasound treatment (from 7.2 +/- 0.79 to 6.7 +/- 0.91 colony forming units per gram of tissue [cfu/g]) and silver antimicrobial dressings (from 7.2 +/- 0.79 to 5.7 +/- 0.6 cfu/g) but increased to 8.6 +/- 0.15 cfu/g for sham and 8.6 +/- 0.06 cfu/g for water-moistened gauze. fourth, 11 patients (average age 60 years) with pressure ulcers containing bacterial counts >10(5) cfu/g of tissue received 2 weeks of noncontact ultrasound therapy. the quantities of seven bacterial organisms were reduced substantially from baseline to 2 weeks post treatment. none of the wounds exhibited signs of a clinical infection during the treatment period and no adverse events were observed. taken together, these four studies indicate that noncontact ultrasound can be used to reduce bacterial quantity. controlled clinical studies are warranted to ascertain the efficacy of this treatment and to further elucidate its effects on various gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == in vitro multispecies lubbock chronic wound biofilm model.
AB  == multispecies biofilms are becoming increasingly recognized as the naturally occurring state in which bacteria reside. one of the primary health issues that is now recognized to be exacerbated by biofilms are chronic, nonhealing wounds such as venous leg ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, and pressure ulcers. arguably three of the most important species associated with multispecies biofilms that our group sees clinically are pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, and  staphylococcus aureus. this study was conducted to address the need for a chronic pathogenic biofilm laboratory model that allows for cooperative growth of these three organisms. we have developed a novel media formulation, simple laboratory system, quantitative polymerase chain reaction for monitoring population dynamics, and methods for objectively and subjectively measuring biofilm formation. the lubbock chronic wound pathogenic biofilm withstood treatment with  a 50-fold higher concentration of bleach than that which was completely bacteriocidal for fully turbid planktonic cultures. the lubbock chronic wound pathogenic biofilm when treated with biofilm effectors such as gallium nitrate and triclosan responded with selective inhibition of pseudomonas aeruginosa or staphylococcus aureus, respectively, as has been reported in the literature. the  ability of this 24-hour model to react as predicted using known biofilm effectors suggests that it will lend itself to future work in the development and testing of first-generation chronic wounds pathogenic biofilm therapeutics. we have defined a realistic in vitro multispecies biofilm model simulating the functional characteristics of chronic pathogenic biofilms and developed effective tools for  its characterization and analyses.

AB  == aim: to assess the antimicrobial efficacy of aqueous (1.25-20 microg ml(-1)) and  gaseous ozone (1-53 g m(-3)) as an alternative antiseptic against endodontic pathogens in suspension and a biofilm model. methodology: enterococcus faecalis,  candida albicans, peptostreptococcus micros and pseudomonas aeruginosa were grown in planctonic culture or in mono-species biofilms in root canals for 3 weeks. cultures were exposed to ozone, sodium hypochlorite (naocl; 5.25%, 2.25%), chlorhexidine digluconate (chx; 2%), hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2); 3%) and phosphate buffered saline (control) for 1 min and the remaining colony forming units counted. ozone gas was applied to the biofilms in two experimental settings, resembling canal areas either difficult (setting 1) or easy (setting 2) to reach. time-course experiments up to 10 min were included. to compare the tested samples, data were analysed by one-way anova. results: concentrations of gaseous ozone down to 1 g m(-3) almost and aqueous ozone down to 5 microg ml(-1)  completely eliminated the suspended microorganisms as did naocl and chx. hydrogen peroxide and lower aqueous ozone concentrations were less effective. aqueous and  gaseous ozone were dose- and strain-dependently effective against the biofilm microorganisms. total elimination was achieved by high-concentrated ozone gas (setting 2) and by naocl after 1 min or a lower gas concentration (4 g m(-3)) after at least 2.5 min. high-concentrated aqueous ozone (20 microg ml(-1)) and chx almost completely eliminated the biofilm cells, whilst h(2)o(2) was less effective. conclusion: high-concentrated gaseous and aqueous ozone was dose-, strain- and time-dependently effective against the tested microorganisms in suspension and the biofilm test model.

TI  == monitoring major mastitis pathogens at the population level based on examination  of bulk tank milk samples.
AB  == the objective was to determine the proportions and bacterial counts of major mastitis pathogens in samples of bulk tank milk (btm), as well as to clarify the  relationship between these bacteria counts and bulk tank somatic cell count (btscc). the purpose was to judge the importance of the counts of mammary pathogens for btscc at the population level. samples of btm were collected from 268 randomly selected anonymous dairy herds (with approximately 29 000 dairy cows). staphylococcus aureus, other coagulase-positive staphylococci, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus dysgalactiae were grouped as contagious pathogens, and streptococcus uberis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium as environmental pathogens. based on assessment of the dominant pathogen in each herd, environmental pathogens were found to dominate. counts of specific mammary pathogens in btm samples did not exceed a geometric mean of 1000 cfu/ml. significant differences were documented in btscc between btm samples containing str. agalactiae, staph. aureus, and str. dysgalactiae and btm samples that were pathogen-free. geometric means of btscc associated with these pathogens were noticeably higher than the overall btscc (str. agalactiae 243 628; staph. aureus  205 610; str. dysgalactiae 203 978; overall 173 000 cells/ml). it follows that the somatic cell count (scc) associated with these pathogens contributed substantially to the overall btscc. environmental pathogens predominated in samples of btm with scc <300x103/ml and contagious mastitis pathogens predominated in btm samples with scc >300x103/ml. no correlation was detected between bacterial counts of specific pathogens and btscc. this study revealed that the assessment of bacterial counts of mammary pathogens in samples of btm in relation to btscc is applicable for the monitoring of changes in the occurrence of major mastitis pathogens in dairy herds at a national level.

TI  == large scale multiplex pcr improves pathogen detection by dna microarrays.
AB  == background: medium density dna microchips that carry a collection of probes for a broad spectrum of pathogens, have the potential to be powerful tools for simultaneous species identification, detection of virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance determinants. however, their widespread use in microbiological diagnostics is limited by the problem of low pathogen numbers in  clinical specimens revealing relatively low amounts of pathogen dna. results: to  increase the detection power of a fluorescence-based prototype-microarray designed to identify pathogenic microorganisms involved in sepsis, we propose a large scale multiplex pcr (lsplex pcr) for amplification of several dozens of gene-segments of 9 pathogenic species. this protocol employs a large set of primer pairs, potentially able to amplify 800 different gene segments that correspond to the capture probes spotted on the microarray. the lsplex protocol is shown to selectively amplify only the gene segments corresponding to the specific pathogen present in the analyte. application of lsplex increases the microarray detection of target templates by a factor of 100 to 1000. conclusion:  our data provide a proof of principle for the improvement of detection of pathogen dna by microarray hybridization by using lsplex pcr.

TI  == removal of radioisotopes in solution and bactericidal/bacteriostatic sterilising  power in activated carbon and metal silver filters.
AB  == activated carbon filters play an important role in water filtration and purification from contaminants of different origin. their limit consists in bacterial proliferation, which may occur only during prolonged periods of non-use and in their ability to remove radioactive contaminants present in waste water from industry or nuclear medicine departments. in this work we tested a commercially available activated carbon filter for water purification enriched with silver plated parts incubating in static condition at room temperature different micro organisms (enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, aspergillum niger), up to 78 days. the microbial growth was in general more inhibited in the presence of metal silver into the activated carbon in respect to filters with the activated carbon alone: >4log inhibition of bacterial proliferation after 78 days of incubation the presence of silver vs. 2log without silver. when the filters were  incubated empty of carbon, the sterilizing power of silver was confirmed further. the activated carbon filters proved also their ability in removing from water the principal radioisotopes used for residues liquid medical and research purposes ((131)i, (99m)tc, (201)tl, (67)ga). these results contribute useful data for the  use of the silver-enriched carbon filters in water filtration both for daily use  at home, and professional use in a nuclear medicine laboratory.

TI  == evaluation of the antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiproliferative activities of the acetone extract of the roots of senna italica (fabaceae).
AB  == senna italica, a member of the fabaceae family (subfamily caesalpinaceae), is widely used traditionally to treat a number of disease conditions, such as sexually transmitted diseases and some forms of intestinal complications. the roots of senna italica were collected from zebediela subregion, limpopo province  (s.a), powdered and extracted with acetone by cold/shaking extraction method. the phytochemical composition of the extract was determined by thin layer chromatography (tlc). the chromatograms were visualised with vanillin-sulphuric acid and p-anisaldehyde reagents. the total phenolic content of the extract was determined by folin-ciocalteu method and expressed as tae/g dry weight. the extract was assayed for the in vitro anticancer activity using jurkat t cells, antioxidant activity using dpph assay and antibacterial activity by bioautographic method and the microtitre plate method. the acetone extract of the roots of senna italica inhibited the growth of jurkat t cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. the extract also had free radical scavenging activity as well as reasonable antibacterial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus with mics ranging from 0,08 to 0.16 mg/ml in the same order as ampicillin the positive control. the biological activities observed in the acetone extract validated the  ethnomedicinal use of senna italica.

TI  == antibacterial activity of extracts of three croton species collected in mpumalanga region in south africa.
AB  == the antibacterial activities of three croton species were compared using bioautography and the serial microdilution methods. the methanolic extracts of all the species had low activity against escherichia coli. the highest activity was observed with croton megalobotrys against enterococcus faecalis with a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 0.02 mg/ml. croton steenkapianus  extracts were the least active of the species investigated, only managing an mic  value of 0.625 mg/ml against pseudomonas aeruginosa. croton megalobotrys leaf powder was serially extracted using solvents of various polarities. the lowest mic value (0.06 mg/ml) of the serially extracted fractions was observed with acetone against pseudomonas aeruginosa. the liquid-liquid fractions of the methanol extract of croton megalobotrys were also tested. the lowest mic value of 0.02 mg/ml was observed with n-hexane fraction against enterococcus faecalis. the carbon tetrachloride fraction was further fractionated using column chromatography with silica as the immobile phase. the resulting seven fractions were tested for activity following the bioassay-guided practice, and it emerged that the first three fractions had active compounds against staphylococcus aureus when the bioautography method was used.

(burseraceae), khaya anthotheca (welm.) c.dc (meliaceae), kirkia wilmsii engl. (kirkiaceae), loxostylis alata a. spreng. ex rchb. (anacardiaceae), ochna natalitia (meisn.) walp. (ochnaceae) and protorhus longifolia (bernh. ex c. krauss) engl. (anacardiaceae) were screened for their antimicrobial activity. the test organisms included bacteria (enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus), and fungi (aspergillus fumigatus, candida  albicans, cryptococcus neoformans, microsporum canis and sporothrix schenckii). a simple bioautographic procedure, involving spraying suspensions of the bacteria or fungi on thin layer chromatography (tlc) plates developed in solvents of varying polarities was used to detect the number of antibacterial and antifungal  compounds present in the extracts. all the extracts had antimicrobial activity against at least one of the test microorganisms. this activity was denoted by white spots against a red-purple background on the tlc plates after spraying with tetrazolium violet. twenty seven tlc plates; 9 for each solvent system and 3 different solvent systems per organism were tested in the bioautographic procedure. of the bacteria tested, s. aureus was inhibited by the most compounds  separated on the tlc plates from all the tested plants. similarly, growth of the  fungus c. neoformans was also inhibited by many compounds present in the extracts. loxostylis alata appeared to be the plant extract with the highest number of inhibition bands when compared with other plants tested against both bacteria and fungi. this species was selected for in depth further study.

TI  == [biochemical and bacteriological investigation of six cases of purple urine bag syndrome (pubs) in a geriatric ward for dementia].
AB  == aim: purple urine bag syndrome is a condition in which the urinary catheter bag turns purple. a tryptophan-indigo hypothesis has been proposed as the mechanism of pubs, in which bacterial decomposition of tryptophan in gut associated with chronic constipation, bacterial overgrowth in the urinary tract and alkaline urine causes production of indigo and discoloration. we considered that further investigation of cases was needed. methods: we investigated 6 cases exhibiting pubs (3 males and 3 females). results: all cases had chronic constipation. oral ingestion was impossible in one case. pubs disappeared after antibiotic treatment (3 cases) or spontaneously (one case). alkaline urine and indicanuria were not found in all cases that showed the disappearance of pubs. in bacterial culture of urine during the exhibition of pubs, enterococcus faecalis was isolated together  with morganella morganii (3 cases) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (one case). single  infections by klebsiella pneumoniae or citrobacter species were also found. after disappearance of pubs, infected bacterial species changed but no cases showed sterile urine. urine and blood alpha-amino-n-butyric acid levels reduced after the disappearance of pubs whereas tryptophan levels did not show related changes. in one case, blood protein concentration increased after the spontaneous disappearance of pubs. indicanuria and alkalization of urine from urinary catheter bag were more intense than of fresh urine. conclusions: the present results generally support the 'tryptophan-indigo hypothesis'. furthermore, it was suggested that additional factors associated with the occurrence of pubs are an environment that facilitates specific bacterial growth in a hospital as well as abnormal metabolism relating to alpha-amino-n-butyric acid and reduced protein synthesis in patients.

AB  == we investigated the microbiological and toxicological effects of three perla black bean extracts on the growth and culture of selected pathogenic microorganisms, the toxicity over vero cell lines and an in vivo rat model. three different solvents were used to obtain perla black bean extracts. all three perla black bean extracts were tested for antibacterial and antiparasitic activity and  further analysed for intrinsic cytotoxicity (ic(50)). methanol perla black bean extract was used for acute toxicity test in rats, with the up-and-down doping method. all perla black bean extracts inhibited bacterial growth. pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella oxytoca, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and listeria monocytogenes showed inhibition, while escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes did not. acidified water and acetic acid perla black bean extract were tested in parasites. the best ic(50) was observed for giardia lamblia, while higher concentrations were active against entamoeba histolytica and trichomonas vaginalis. the vero cells toxicity levels (ic(50)) for methanol, acidified water  and acetic acid perla black bean extract were [mean +/- s.d. (95% ci)]: 275 +/- 6.2 (267.9-282.0), 390 +/- 4.6 (384.8-395.2) and 209 +/- 3.39 (205.6-212.4) microg/ml, respectively. in vivo acute toxicity assays did not show changes in absolute organ weights, gross and histological examinations of selected tissues or functional tests. the acetic acid and methanol perla black bean extract proved to exhibit strong antibacterial activity and the acidified water perla black bean extract exerted parasiticidal effects against giardia lamblia, entamoeba hystolitica and trichomonas vaginalis. the three perla black bean extracts assayed over vero cells showed very low toxicity and the methanol perla black bean extract in vivo did not cause toxicity.

TI  == characterization of guanylate kinase from gram positive and gram negative microorganisms; preliminary results.
AB  == guanylate kinase is a member of the nucleoside monophosphate (nmp) kinase family, a family of enzymes that despite having a low primary structure identity share a  similar fold, which consists of three structurally distinct regions termed the core, lid, and nmp-binding regions. guanylate kinase (gmpk) is an essential enzyme for the biosynthesis of gtp and dgtp by catalyzing the phosphoryl transfer from atp to (d)gmp resulting in adp and (d)gdp. despite the similar fold of the monomer there is an important difference between gmpks from prokaryotes and eukaryotes: eukaryotes gmpk are monomers while prokaryotes gmpk are dimmers, tetramers or hexamers. for this reason bacterial gmpks are possible targets for new antibacterial drugs. finding new targets for antibacterial therapies is a prior subject in today's medical research. the purpose of this work was to characterize guanylate kinases from both gram positive and gram negative pathogenic bacteria. we started with gmpk from enterococcus faecalis as gram positive microorganism and pseudomonas aeruginosa as gram negative representative.

TI  == pseudomonas aeruginosa suppresses host immunity by activating the daf-2 insulin-like signaling pathway in caenorhabditis elegans.
AB  == some pathogens have evolved mechanisms to overcome host immune defenses by inhibiting host defense signaling pathways and suppressing the expression of host defense effectors. we present evidence that pseudomonas aeruginosa is able to suppress the expression of a subset of immune defense genes in the animal host caenorhabditis elegans by activating the daf-2/daf-16 insulin-like signaling pathway. the daf-2/daf-16 pathway is important for the regulation of many aspects of organismal physiology, including metabolism, stress response, longevity, and immune function. we show that intestinal expression of daf-16 is required for resistance to p. aeruginosa and that the suppression of immune defense genes is dependent on the insulin-like receptor daf-2 and the foxo transcription factor daf-16. by visualizing the subcellular localization of daf-16::gfp fusion protein in live animals during infection, we show that p. aeruginosa-mediated downregulation of a subset of immune genes is associated with the ability to translocate daf-16 from the nuclei of intestinal cells. suppression of daf-16 is  mediated by an insulin-like peptide, ins-7, which functions upstream of daf-2. both the inhibition of daf-16 and downregulation of daf-16-regulated genes, such  as thn-2, lys-7, and spp-1, require the p. aeruginosa two-component response regulator gaca and the quorum-sensing regulators lasr and rhlr and are not observed during infection with salmonella typhimurium or enterococcus faecalis. our results reveal a new mechanism by which p. aeruginosa suppresses host immune  defense.

TI  == innate immunity in caenorhabditis elegans is regulated by neurons expressing npr-1/gpcr.
AB  == a large body of evidence indicates that metazoan innate immunity is regulated by  the nervous system, but the mechanisms involved in the process and the biological importance of such control remain unclear. we show that a neural circuit involving npr-1, which encodes a g protein-coupled receptor (gpcr) related to mammalian neuropeptide y receptors, functions to suppress innate immune responses. the immune inhibitory function requires a guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate-gated ion channel encoded by tax-2 and tax-4 as well as the soluble guanylate cyclase gcy-35. furthermore, we show that npr-1- and gcy-35-expressing sensory neurons actively suppress immune responses of nonneuronal tissues. a full-genome microarray analysis on animals with altered neural function due to mutation in npr-1 shows an enrichment in genes that are markers of innate immune responses, including those regulated by a conserved pmk-1/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. these results present evidence that neurons directly control innate immunity in c. elegans, suggesting that gpcrs may participate in neural circuits that receive inputs from either pathogens or infected sites and integrate them to coordinate appropriate immune responses.

AB  == the objective of the present study was to evaluate the antioxidant as well as the antibacterial properties of secondary metabolites obtained from drosera aliciae (alice sundew) plants grown in vitro and to examine the mechanism of their antimicrobial action. bactericidal activity of extracts from d. aliciae, as well  as pure ramentaceone (naphthoquinone), which is present in this plant, were examined against human pathogenic strains of micro-organisms that are both resistant and susceptible to antibiotics. a chloroform extract proved to be more  effective than a methanol preparation against all of the tested strains, except for pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. the lowest minimal-bactericidal-concentration value was in the case of staphylococcus aureus (25-50 mg fresh weight.ml-1). the influence of d. aliciae extracts and ramentaceone on the synthesis of dna, rna or proteins in cultures of enterococcus faecalis was estimated by measurement of the incorporation of the radioactively labelled precursors [3h]thymidine, [3h]uridine or [3h]leucine respectively. the methanol extract of d. aliciae, except for a moderate effect on dna synthesis, had no influence on rna and protein synthesis. the chloroform preparation caused  about a 75% decrease in [3h]uridine incorporation in comparison with the control  after 60 min and a significant diminution in dna and protein synthesis (44 and 30% respectively). ramentaceone also decreased dna and rna synthesis, but less efficiently than did the chloroform extract, and it caused no changes in [3h]leucine incorporation. the methanol extract from d. aliciae proved to be an effective antioxidant in both the dpph (2,2-diphenyl-10-picrylhydrazyl free radical) and the frap (ferric reducing antioxidant power) assay, with the activities exceeding those of well-known antioxidants, namely the flavonoids. the chloroform extract and ramentaceone showed no antioxidative properties.

TI  == lipids including cholesteryl linoleate and cholesteryl arachidonate contribute to the inherent antibacterial activity of human nasal fluid.
AB  == mucosal surfaces provide first-line defense against microbial invasion through their complex secretions. the antimicrobial activities of proteins in these secretions have been well delineated, but the contributions of lipids to mucosal  defense have not been defined. we found that normal human nasal fluid contains all major lipid classes (in micrograms per milliliter), as well as lipoproteins and apolipoprotein a-i. the predominant less polar lipids were myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic acid, cholesterol, and cholesteryl palmitate, cholesteryl linoleate, and cholesteryl arachidonate. normal human bronchioepithelial cell secretions exhibited a similar lipid composition. removal of less-polar lipids significantly decreased the inherent antibacterial activity of nasal fluid against pseudomonas aeruginosa, which was in part restored after replenishing the lipids. furthermore, lipids extracted from nasal fluid exerted direct antibacterial activity in synergism with the antimicrobial human neutrophil peptide hnp-2 and liposomal formulations of cholesteryl linoleate and cholesteryl arachidonate were active against p. aeruginosa at physiological concentrations as found in nasal fluid and exerted inhibitory activity against other gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. these data suggest that host-derived lipids contribute to mucosal defense. the emerging concept of host-derived antimicrobial lipids unveils novel roads to a better understanding of the immunology of infectious diseases.

TI  == comparative survey of putrescine production from agmatine deamination in different bacteria.
AB  == this article aims to study putrescine production in lactobacillus hilgardii strain x(1)b, an agmatine degrader isolated from wine, and to compare it with three other different species, previously reported as putrescine producers from agmatine: pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1, enterococcus faecalis atcc11700 and bacillus cereus cect 148(t). the effect of different biogenic amines, organic acids, cofactors, amino acids and sugars on putrescine production was evaluated.  in some cases, a similar effect was found in all the strains studied but the magnitude differed. arginine, glucose and fructose showed an inhibitory effect, whereas the presence of agmatine induced the production of putrescine in all microorganisms. in other cases, the effect differed between p. aeruginosa pao1 and the other microorganisms. histamine and tyramine poorly influenced the utilization of agmatine, although a small increase in putrescine production was observed in p. aeruginosa pao1. succinate, spermidine and spermine also led to an increase in putrescine production in p. aeruginosa pao1, whereas the succinate had no effect in the other microorganisms. spermine and spermidine always produced a diminution in agmatine deamination. in this work, we have also demonstrated that pyridoxal 5-phosphate, mg(2+) and mn(2+) had no effect on putrescine production from agmatine. results presented in this paper indicate differences in regulation mechanisms of agmatine deiminase pathway among p. aeruginosa pao1 and l. hilgardii x(1)b, e. faecalis atcc11700 and b. cereus cect  148(t). these results are significant from two points of view, first food quality, and second the toxicological and microbiological aspects. it should be taken into account that putrescine, whose origin is still controversial, is quantitatively the main biogenic amine found in food.

TI  == effect of triclosan on the formation of crystalline biofilms by mixed communities of urinary tract pathogens on urinary catheters.
AB  == the crystalline bacterial biofilms that encrust foley catheters compromise the care of many elderly and disabled patients. the aim of this study was to examine  whether the biocide triclosan can prevent encrustation by the mixed flora of uropathogens that commonly infect patients undergoing long-term catheterization.  models of the catheterized bladder were inoculated with communities of organisms  isolated from patients who were experiencing catheter blockage. the catheter retention balloons were inflated with water or triclosan (3 g triclosan l(-1) in  0.1 m sodium carbonate) and urine was supplied to the models for up to 7 days. the effect of triclosan was recorded on the viable cell populations, the ph of the residual urine and the times that catheters took to block. the extent of encrustation of the catheters was visualized by scanning electron microscopy. in  models inoculated with communities containing proteus mirabilis, triclosan prevented the rise in urinary ph that drives crystalline biofilm formation and catheter blockage. the biocide had no effect on populations of enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli and  klebsiella pneumoniae were eliminated from the residual urine and the catheters drained freely for the 7-day experimental period. in models inoculated with a mixed community containing providencia rettgeri, catheters inflated with triclosan continued to block rapidly. although k. pneumoniae and proteus vulgaris were eliminated from the residual urine, there was no effect on the viability of  providencia rettgeri. the results indicate that the triclosan strategy should be  limited to the treatment of patients who are infected with proteus mirabilis.

TI  == a potential plasmid-curing agent, 8-epidiosbulbin e acetate, from dioscorea bulbifera l. against multidrug-resistant bacteria.
AB  == bioassay-guided fractionation of an aqueous methanolic extract of dioscorea bulbifera l. bulbs was performed using organic solvents. a novel plasmid-curing compound was identified as 8-epidiosbulbin e acetate (eea) (norditerpene) on the  basis of modern spectroscopic analysis and x-ray crystallography. eea exhibited broad-spectrum plasmid-curing activity against multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococci. eea cured antibiotic resistance plasmids (r-plasmids) from clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, shigella sonnei and pseudomonas aeruginosa with 12-48% curing efficiency. the reference plasmids of bacillus subtilis (pub110), e. coli (rp4),  p. aeruginosa (rip64) and salmonella typhi (r136) were cured with efficiency ranging from 16% to 64%. eea-mediated r-plasmid curing decreased the minimal inhibitory concentration of antibiotics against mdr bacteria, thus making antibiotic treatment more effective. the antibiotic resistance pattern revealed that the compound was effective in the reversal of bacterial resistance to various antibiotics. in addition, the compound did not show any cytotoxicity against a broad range of human cancer cell lines, namely mcf-7 (breast cancer), siha (cervical cancer) and a431 (epidermal carcinoma), and hence has the potential to be used as a lead compound for drug discovery programmes.

TI  == surfactants as microbicides and contraceptive agents: a systematic in vitro study.
AB  == background: the urgent need for cheap and easy-to-use protection against both unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases has stimulated considerable interest in the use of surfactants as microbicides, anti-viral, and  contraceptive agents in recent years. in the present study we report a systematic in vitro evaluation of the microbicidal, anti-viral and contraceptive potential of cationic, anionic, zwitterionic, and non-ionic surfactants. methodology/principal findings: toxicity was evaluated in mammalian columnar epithelial (mdck) cells, human sperm cells, candida albicans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, neisseria gonorrhoeae, streptococcus agalactiae and enterococcus faecalis. the inhibition of adenovirus and lentivirus infection of mdck cells was also tested. a homologous series of cationic surfactants, alkyl-n,n,n-trimethylammonium bromides (c(n)tab), with varying alkyl chains were  shown to be bactericidal and fungicidal at doses that were related to the surfactant critical micelle concentrations (cmc), all of them at concentrations significantly below the cmc. in general, bacteria were more susceptible to this surfactant group than c. albicans and this organism, in turn, was more susceptible than mdck cells. this suggests that the c(n)tab may be useful as vaginal disinfectants only in so far as bacterial and fungal infections are concerned. none of the surfactants examined, including those that have been used  in pre-clinical studies, showed inhibition of adenovirus or lentivirus infection  of mdck cells or spermicidal activity at doses that were sub-toxic to mdck cells. conclusions/significance: the results of this study lead us to propose that systematic analysis of surfactant toxicity, such as we report in the present work, be made a mandatory pre-condition for the use of these substances in pre-clinical animal and/or human studies.

TI  == ceftobiprole: a review of a broad-spectrum and anti-mrsa cephalosporin.
AB  == ceftobiprole, an investigational cephalosporin, is currently in phase iii clinical development. ceftobiprole is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with demonstrated in vitro activity against gram-positive cocci, including meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and meticillin-resistant s. epidermidis, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, gram-negative bacilli including ampc-producing escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but excluding extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. like cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and cefepime, ceftobiprole demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis and  non-fragilis bacteroides spp. in single-step and serial passage in vitro resistance development studies, ceftobiprole demonstrated a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. ceftobiprole, like cefepime, is a weak inducer and a poor substrate for ampc beta-lactamases.ceftobiprole medocaril, the prodrug of ceftobiprole, is converted by plasma esterases to ceftobiprole in <30  minutes. peak serum concentrations of ceftobiprole observed at the end of a single 30-minute infusion were 35.5 mug/ml for a 500-mg dose and 59.6 mug/ml for  a 750-mg dose. the volume of distribution of ceftobiprole is 0.26 l/kg ( approximately 18 l), protein binding is 16%, and its serum half-life is approximately 3.5 hours. ceftobiprole is renally excreted ( approximately 70% in  the active form) and systemic clearance correlates with creatinine clearance, meaning that dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal dysfunction. ceftobiprole has a modest post-antibiotic effect (pae) of approximately 0.5 hours for mrsa and a longer pae of approximately 2 hours for penicillin-resistant pneumococci. ceftobiprole, when administered intravenously at 500 mg once every 8 hours (2-hour infusion), has a >90% probability of achieving f t(>mic) (free drug concentration exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]) for 40% and 60%, respectively, of the dosing interval for isolates with ceftobiprole mic < or =4 and < or =2 mg/l, respectively.currently, only limited clinical trial data are published for ceftobiprole. in a phase iii trial, 784 patients with gram-positive skin infections were randomized to treatment with either ceftobiprole 500 mg or vancomycin 1 g, each administered twice daily for 7-14 days; 93.3% of patients were clinically cured with ceftobiprole compared with 93.5% receiving vancomycin, and the eradication rate for mrsa infections was 91.8% for ceftobiprole compared  with 90% for vancomycin. a phase iii, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial compared ceftobiprole 500 mg every 8 hours with vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours plus ceftazidime 1 g every 8 hours in patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections. of the 828 patients enrolled, 31% had diabetic foot infections, 30% had abscesses, and 22% had wounds. no difference in clinical cure was reported in the clinically evaluable, intent-to-treat and microbiologically evaluable populations with cure rates of 90.5%, 81.9%, and 90.8%, respectively, in the ceftobiprole-treated patients and 90.2%, 80.8%, and 90.5%, respectively, in the vancomycin plus ceftazidime-treated group. microbiologic eradication of gram-positive cocci meticillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) [ceftobiprole 91% vs  vancomycin plus ceftazidime 92%] and mrsa (ceftobiprole 87% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 80%), as well as gram-negative bacilli, e. coli (ceftobiprole 89% vs  vancomycin plus ceftazidime 92%), and p. aeruginosa (ceftobiprole 87% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 100%), was not significantly different between groups. similar cures rates in the microbiologically evaluable population occurred in both groups for panton-valentine leukocidin (pvl)-positive mssa and pvl-positive mrsa.currently, ceftobiprole has completed phase iii trials for complicated skin and skin structure infections due to mrsa and nosocomial pneumonia due to suspected or proven mrsa; phase iii trials are also ongoing in community-acquired pneumonia. ceftobiprole has so far demonstrated a good safety  profile in preliminary studies with similar tolerability to comparators. the broad-spectrum activity of ceftobiprole may allow it to be used as monotherapy in situations where a combination of antibacterials might be required. further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftobiprole  and to define its role in patient care.

AB  == aim: traditional methods for bile culturing may miss a large number of underlying bacterial infections that could lead to acute or chronic cholecystitis. aim: to evaluate possible differences regarding the site of material collection and thus  to detect the most suitable sample site for gallbladder culture. methods: a cohort of 137 patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis was enrolled. after surgical excision of the gallbladder, bile cultures were separately performed from fundus, body and neck. identification of bacteria as well as computation of  mean bacterial concentrations were performed with standard microbiological techniques. wilcoxon's paired and chi-square tests were used for comparison between continuous and discrete parameters, respectively. results: thirty-one patients (22.6%) demonstrated at least one positive culture sample. positivity was 31/31 (100.0%) in neck samples, 20/31 (64.5%) in body and 13/31 (41.9%) in fundus samples (p<0.001). the microorganisms identified were escherichia coli (14 cases) and enterococcus faecalis (10 cases), followed by staphylococcus aureus (3 cases), pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecium, enterobacter aerogenes and  enterobacter cloacae (1 case each). mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the neck (272.2 +/- 187.5) were higher (p<0.01) when compared to those derived from both the body (38.2 +/- 28.7) and the fundus (12.5 +/- 11.3). mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the body were higher (p<0.01) than those derived from the fundus. conclusion: the neck of the gallbladder hosts the biggest bacterial load in comparison with the body and the fundus. this difference might be attributed to the presence of rokitansky-aschoff sinuses, which is the main histological characteristic of the  region.

TI  == method for evaluation of the efficacy of antimicrobial preservatives in cosmetic  wet wipes.
AB  == many cosmetic formulations are now available in the form of wet wipes packaged in sealed sachets or packets. like the majority of cosmetic products having an aqueous phase, wipes are susceptible to microbial contamination and require the addition of preservatives. the efficacy of such preservatives can be evaluated using a standard challenge test performed on the wetting liquid but this test cannot be regarded as representative for this new type of formulation. the method presented here evaluates the efficacy of preservatives used in wet wipes kept in  their original packaging. dried inoculums were prepared by membrane filtration followed by drying in an incubator. the method is applicable to bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis), bacillus cereus spores and fungi (candida albicans and aspergillus niger). these inoculated carriers were inserted between two wipes in the original package, which was then re-sealed immediately. the test requires one dry inoculum per packet and one packet for each control or test. after incubation at 22.5 degrees c for 1, 2, 7, 14 or 28 days and, for the control, immediately after insertion of the membrane (time 0), microorganism counts were performed on the germ-carrier membranes as well as on adjacent wipes, after transfer into a suitable neutralizing agent. the membranes were shaken in the presence of glass beads and microorganisms were dissociated from the wipes by means of a stomacher. the supernatants recovered after being left to stand for 20 min are counted by pour plate method or membrane filtration. the feasibility of the method was demonstrated for each of the seven above-mentioned strains. the repeatability and reproducibility of the results obtained is similar to that obtained for preservative efficacy tests in the pharmacopoeias. the lethal rate of microorganisms during the preparation of dry inoculums ranges from 50 to 90% depending on the strain and the test (generally, a spontaneous reduction of about 1 log up to a maximum of 2 log). the recovery rate for microorganisms from dry inoculums (on membranes) at time 0 (control = t(0)) is around 90%, regardless of  the strain or the test. the number of microorganisms recovered from the wipes (w(0)) is between 2 and 10% of the number recovered from membranes (t(0)) and may be considered negligible. application of this method to different types of wipes  demonstrates that the efficacy of preservatives, expressed as the logarithmic reduction in the number of microorganisms at each time point, depends on the type of wipe and on the strain tested. the results obtained are considerably different from those found with the standard challenge tests applied to wetting liquids for wipes. the differences found confirm the need for a specific method applicable to wipes.

TI  == ceftobiprole: an extended-spectrum anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin.
AB  == objective: to summarize and evaluate the literature concerning ceftobiprole. data sources: literature identification was conducted through medline (1966-february 2008) and international pharmaceutical abstracts (1970-february 2008) using the terms ceftobiprole, medocaril, bal 5788, ro-5788, bal 9141, ro 63-9141, pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, mrsa, complicated skin and skin-structure infections (csssis), community-acquired pneumonia, and nosocomial pneumonia. additional publications were identified through a review of articles and abstracts from infectious disease meetings. study selection and data extraction: all articles in english were evaluated and all pertinent information was included. data synthesis: ceftobiprole medocaril is an extended-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp., vancomycin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, enterobacteriaceae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. inactivity includes extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae and enterococcus faecium. preliminary data suggest that ceftobiprole may be effective with a 1-hour infusion of 500 mg every 12 hours for gram-positive infections and 500 mg every 8 hours with a 2-hour infusion for polymicrobial infections. two clinical trials support these dosing regimens for csssis. ceftobiprole was noninferior to vancomycin in suspected gram-positive csssis, with cure rates of 93.3% and 93.5%, respectively. furthermore, ceftobiprole was noninferior to vancomycin and ceftazidime in polymicrobial csssis (cure rates 90.5% vs 90.2%, respectively). although the total number of adverse effects was similar to those of the comparator, more patients in the ceftobiprole group experienced nausea, vomiting, and dysgeusia. conclusions: the  activity of ceftobiprole and limited clinical data suggest that it may be useful  as empiric monotherapy for csssi and in combination with other antimicrobials in  lower respiratory tract infections for which phase 3 clinical trials are currently exploring. although not shown in vitro, ceftobiprole may induce resistance due to its broad spectrum of activity. approval is expected for the treatment of csssi.

TI  == the antimicrobial and antifungal efficacy of tetracycline-integrated gutta-percha.
AB  == the purpose of this study was in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial and antifungal efficacy of commercially available gutta-percha containing tetracycline on some potential endodontic pathogens. the test microorganisms were enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, porphyromonas endodontalis, and candida albicans . tetracycline-integrated gutta-percha (tgp) cones, tetracycline disc, and conventional gutta-percha cones  of the same size were placed on the inoculated plates. the plates were incubated  at 37 degrees c aerobically or anaerobically. growth inhibition zones on each plate were inspected at 24, 48, and 72 h. tetracycline disc and tgp cones inhibited all the tested bacterial strains, however the greatest antimicrobial effect was seen on s. aureus. tetracycline disc and tgp seemed less effective on  e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa. however, all tested treatments were unable to affect c. albicans . based on the results of this study, it seems that tgp offers an antimicrobial advantage over conventional gutta-percha.

TI  == the establishment of resistance phenotypes for bacteria isolated from outpatients in urine cultures.
AB  == from 1911 outpatients, who addressed a timisoara private clinical laboratory, from january to december 2005, we collected 1,889 urine cultures, 431 being positive. bacteria identification was generally done using morphological, cultural, biochemical characters and pathogenicity tests. sensitivity testing to  antimicrobial medical drugs was done by using the classical diffusion kirby-bauer method and the automatic analyzer osiris, also. the main bacteria involved in the etiology of these infections were represented by enterobacteriaceae, head of the  list being escherichia coli (81.21%), followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (8.35%) and proteus mirabilis (3.02%). we also isolated gram positive cocci (in a much smaller proportion), mainly represented by enterococcus faecalis (1.16%), staphylococcus aureus (0.93%), streptococcus agalactiae, and also gram negative non-fermentative bacilli, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.93%) or acinetobacter baumanii (0.23%). as soon as we performed the sensitivity tests, we divided them  in resistance phenotypes: most of the enterobacteriaceae were integrated in the wild phenotype, followed by the penicillinase producing phenotype. an e. coli strain (0.29%) and 3 klebsiella pneumoniae strains (8.33%) were integrated in the large spectrum, multidrug resistant, beta-lactamase producing phenotype, also associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides; non-fermentative bacilli did not present special resistance problems, the four pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were integrated in the wild phenotype (secreting induced chromosomal cephalosporinase). as for staphylococcus aureus it was identified a strain having fluoroquinolone resistance, two strains secreting penicillinase and having a k (nm) phenotype and a strain secreting penicillinase  only. antibiotic resistance represents a major concern for patients, physicians,  healthcare managers, and policymakers. the use of antibiotics is closely linked with the development of acquired antibiotic resistance.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of ceftobiprole, a novel anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin, tested against contemporary pathogens: results from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (2005-2006).
AB  == ceftobiprole is a 1st-in-class anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) extended-spectrum cephalosporin currently in clinical trials for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssis) and nosocomial pneumonia. this agent is also active against other prominent gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, making it an attractive candidate for  broad-spectrum therapy. we evaluated the in vitro potency of ceftobiprole tested  against the most commonly occurring bacterial pathogens as part of a global surveillance study for the years 2005 to 2006 (>60 medical centers in north america, latin america, and europe). all isolates (40 675) were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. ceftobiprole inhibited 100% and >99% of tested s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at < or =4 and  < or =8 microg/ml, respectively, although mic90 values for oxacillin-resistant strains were 4-fold and 8-fold higher than oxacillin-susceptible isolates for the 2 groups. ceftobiprole was also broadly active against streptococcus pneumoniae,  beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci, inhibiting >98% of isolates at <  or =0.5 microg/ml. although ceftobiprole was generally inactive against enterococcus faecium, the majority of enterococcus faecalis strains (95.7%) were  inhibited at < or =4 microg/ml. this agent was similar in potency to the "3rd- and 4th-generation" cephems (mic50 values, < or =0.06 microg/ml) for all tested enterobacteriaceae. although cefepime provided enhanced coverage against klebsiella spp. (86.5% at < or =8 microg/ml versus 76.9-81.7% for ceftobiprole and ceftazidime), ceftobiprole and cefepime were superior to ceftazidime against  enterobacter spp. and citrobacter spp. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftobiprole was equal in potency to ceftazidime (mic50, 2 microg/ml) and 2-fold  more potent than cefepime. none of these agents inhibited >45% of acinetobacter spp. at 8 mug/ml. ceftobiprole is a new anti-mrsa beta-lactam with recognized activity against the most commonly occurring enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, similar to that of extended-spectrum cephems. these characteristics warrant continued evaluation of the agent as empiric therapy for csssis, and in pneumonia, especially in those institutions/regions where mrsa and p. aeruginosa  may be prevalent.

TI  == antibacterial effects of chitosan powder: mechanisms of action.
AB  == chitosan, the deacetylated derivative of chitin, is a natural d-glucosamine polymer that can be extracted from the shells of seafood such as prawns crabs and lobsters. it can be used as a flocculent, plant disease resistant promoter, anti-cancer agent, wound healing promotion agent and antimicrobial agent. the aim of this paper is the study of the interaction between chitosan powder and various kinds of pathogen microorganisms potentially present in water. first of all, physico-chemical characterisations of chitin and chitosan powder were performed.  the deacetylation yields were 35%, 60% and 80 +/- 10%. the experimental studies focused on the measurements of the mortality constant rate for various bacterial  strains, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus saprophyticus. an explanation of the antibacterial mechanisms is proposed involving the cell wall disruption due to free amino groups present in chitosan.

TI  == improved diagnosis specificity in bone and joint infections using molecular techniques.
AB  == objectives: the microbiological diagnosis of osteoarticular infections currently  relies on microbiological cultures, to specifically target treatment. however, these conventional methods sometimes lack of sensitivity and of specificity to establish definitive diagnosis. this study was conducted to determine whether molecular method could improve bacterial bone and joint infection diagnosis. methods: we evaluated the performance of nucleic acid extraction with the semi-automated nuclisens minimag instrument coupled to 16s rdna sequencing on 76  samples collected from 51 patients with suspected infections: prosthetic-joint infection (15), spondylodiscitis (7) acute septic arthritis (11) and 18 controls. no pre-treatment of the sample was done before nucleic acid extraction. classification in infected group required an accumulation of arguments. results:  our molecular method identified a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and fastidious bacteria like neisseria gonorrhoeae and fusobacterium  nucleatum. the overall pcr sensitivity was 73.3%: 53.8% for prosthetic-joint infections and 88.2% for infections without prostheses. the overall pcr specificity was 95.2%, whereas culture specificity was only 85.7%. conclusions: the instrument was simple to use and provided nucleic acids free of pcr inhibitors and free of contamination by foreign bacterial dna. our study highlights the need for still improved molecular diagnostic sensitivity.

TI  == postoperative pneumonia after major pulmonary resections: an unsolved problem in  thoracic surgery.
AB  == background: antibiotics currently recommended for prophylaxis in thoracic surgery are first-generation and second-generation cephalosporins. despite this prophylaxis, postoperative pneumonia after major pulmonary resections remains frequent and severe. however, in the medical literature, the origin of these infections is poorly documented. methods: to evaluate the efficiency of current prophylactic regimens, we retrospectively analyzed 312 consecutive cases of major pulmonary resection, performed between january 2000 and december 2004. for patients who experienced postoperative pulmonary infection, the microbiologic agents and their antibiotic susceptibility were studied. results: a postoperative pneumonia was diagnosed in 76 patients (24.4% +/- 0.43%). sixty patients (78.9%)  experienced the infection in the first 5 postoperative days. a microbiologic documentation was obtained in 44 cases (57.9%) with 56 microorganisms involved. pathogens responsible for the infections were staphylococcus aureus (n = 10), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 8), group b streptococcus organisms (n = 1), nongroupable streptococcus organisms (n = 2), enterococcus faecalis (n = 1), haemophilus spp. (n = 9), branhamella catarrhalis (n = 2), enterobacteriaceae (n  = 15), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1), and candida spp. (n = 4). according to the antibiotic susceptibility testings, the prophylactic regimen by cefazolin proved ineffective for 84% of the microbiologically documented cases. conclusions: this study confirmed the inefficiency of current prophylaxis against pathogens involved in postoperative pneumonia after major lung resections. evaluation of new and more-adapted approaches of antibiotic prophylaxis should be the subject of prospective multicenter trials.

TI  == preoperative sterilization and disinfection of drill guide templates.
AB  == the aim of the in vitro study was to evaluate the decontamination potential of common antiseptic solutions for heat-sensitive implantological drill guide templates. one hundred implantologists were evaluated on the basis of a questionnaire for their measures of disinfection. on the basis of these results,  80% alcohol, octenidine 0.1%, and chlorhexidine 0.12% were tested in an in vitro  model for their decontamination efficacy for heat-sensitive plastic material infected with pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and candida albicans. the microorganisms were selected on the basis of results of environmental testing of dental laboratories. the results of  the questionnaire revealed that chlorhexidine was used by 30%, 80% alcohol by 23%, and octenidine by 7% of the dentists. using the in vitro model, with the exception of s. aureus, chlorhexidine was not able to completely eliminate the microorganisms after 15 min of application. in contrast, the treatment with octenidine revealed no further growth of the tested microorganisms after that time. the 80% alcohol was more efficient. no growth of microorganisms could be detected in any of the tests after 5 min of incubation. on the basis of our results and due to the fact that suitable installations for sterilization were hardly used by the dental practitioners, the disinfection of templates should be  preferentially performed with 80% alcohol or octenidine using an incubation time  of 15 min with ultrasonication.

TI  == development of flexible antimicrobial films using essential oils as active agents.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity in the vapor-phase of laboratory-made flexible films of polypropylene (pp) and polyethylene/ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (pe/evoh) incorporating essential oil of cinnamon ( cinnamomum zeylanicum), oregano ( origanum vulgare), clove ( syzygium aromaticum), or cinnamon fortified with cinnamaldehyde was evaluated against a wide range of microorganisms: the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella choleraesuis; the gram-positive bacteria listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis; the molds penicillium islandicum, penicillium roqueforti, penicillium nalgiovense, eurotium repens, and a spergillus flavus and the yeasts candida albicans, debaryomyces hansenii, and zigosaccharomyces rouxii. films with a nominal concentration of 4% (w/w) of fortified cinnamon or oregano essential oil  completely inhibited the growth of the fungi; higher concentrations were required to inhibit the gram-positive bacteria (8 and 10%, respectively), and higher concentrations still were necessary to inhibit the gram-negative bacteria. pp films were more effective than pe/evoh films. the atmospheres generated by the antimicrobial films inside petri dishes were quantitatively analyzed using headspace-single drop microextraction (hs-sdme) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms). the analyses showed that the oregano-fortified pp films released higher levels of carvacrol and thymol, and the cinnamon-fortified pp films released higher levels of cinnamaldehyde, during  the first 3-6 h of incubation, than the corresponding pe/evoh films. shelf-life tests were also performed, demonstrating that the antifungal activities of the films persisted for more than two months after their manufacture. in addition, migration tests (overall and specific) were performed, using both aqueous and fatty simulants, to ensure that the films meet eu regulations regarding food contact materials. following contact with the tested films, the substances that had migrated into the aqueous simulants were recovered by direct immersion-single drop extraction (di-sdme) and then analyzed by gc-ms. the fatty stimulant (isooctane) was directly injected into the chromatographic system.

AB  == we evaluated the usefulness of an early-harvested bacterial cell suspension to the fully automated raisus (nissui pharmaceuticals co., ltd., tokyo) to provide the results of species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testings within a day after overnight-incubation of the primary cultures. a single, well-separated colony appeared on the primary culture plate was transferred onto  a blood agar or chocolate agar plates, then incubated for 3 to 6 hours. the cell  suspension to the raisus was properly prepared to the mcfarland 0.5 turbidity from the early-harvested bacterial cells. when the five atcc reference strains, consisting of staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, streptococcus pneumoniae atcc 49619, escherichia coli atcc 25922 and pseudomonas  aeruginosa atcc 27853, were repeatedly tested for the species-identification, all the identification results were acceptable. antimicrobial susceptibility tests were evaluated with the above five strains and haemophilus influenzae atcc 49247. the results obtained indicated that the most susceptibility test results were comparable to those mics obtained by the standard test procedure, but some strains, in particular, h. influenzae and p. aeruginosa gave significantly discrepant mics for certain antimicrobial agents. the significant discrepancy in  mic determinations regarded the difference of viable cell concentrations in the cell suspension prepared respectively. through the analysis of laboratory workflow, it became to apparent that 18s to 20s of the tests were completed by 5:00 p.m., and it required to wait until 3:00 a.m. to complete 90s of the tests.  with these results, the early-harvested bacterial cell suspension is applicable to species-identification by raisus, but it is necessary to adjust viable cell concentrations to antimicrobial susceptibility test. also, it is urgent to reconstitute a daily workflow to improve the rapidity of raisus test function.

TI  == bacteria induce ctgf and cyr61 expression in epithelial cells in a lysophosphatidic acid receptor-dependent manner.
AB  == cysteine-rich protein 61 (cyr61/ccn1) and connective tissue growth factor (ctgf/ccn2) are members of the ccn (cyr61, ctgf, nephroblastoma overexpressed gene) family and exert pleiotropic functions such as regulation of adhesion, migration, extracellular matrix deposition, or cell differentiation, and play an  important role in wound healing. this study focused on the nature of the so far unknown ctgf and cyr61 mrna expression of epithelial cells after infection with bacteria. we demonstrate that infection of epithelial cells with attenuated yersinia enterocolitica lacking the virulence plasmid pyv leads to the expression of cyr61 and ctgf. virulent y. enterocolitica bearing the pyv virulence plasmid suppressed the mrna expression of these genes. yersinia-mediated inhibition of ctgf and cyr61 mrna expression is partially mediated by the cysteine protease yopt. further characterization of the yersinia factors, which trigger ctgf and cyr61 mrna expression, demonstrated that these factors were secreted and could be enriched in lipid extracts. beside yersinia, several other bacteria such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, or staphylococcus aureus, as well as supernatants of these bacteria induced ctgf and cyr61 expression. blocking experiments with the lysophosphatidic acid (lpa) receptor-specific inhibitor ki16425 suggest a general involvement of lpa receptors in bacteria-triggered ctgf and cyr61 expression. these data suggest that lpa receptor-dependent expression of ctgf and cyr61 represents a common host response after interaction with bacteria.

TI  == penetration of gatifloxacin eye drops into the aqueous humor in humans.
AB  == the authors topically administered gatifloxacin (gflx) into the eye before cataract surgery and measured the concentrations of this agent to determine its penetration into aqueous humor. seventy-seven patients with age-related cataracts who underwent cataract surgery were enrolled in this study. they received 0.3% gflx ophthalmic solution 4 times at 30-min intervals, beginning 2 h before surgery. aqueous humor was aspirated from the anterior chamber and assayed for gflx concentration using high-performance liquid chromatography. the mean intraoperative gflx concentration in aqueous humor was 0.485 +/- 0.328 microg/ml. gflx level was 0.573 +/- 0.367 microg/ml in elderly patients, at least 70 years of age, and was significantly higher than that (0.322 +/- 0.135 microg/ml) in the patients less than 70 years old. this concentration was close to or higher than the minimum inhibitory concentrations required to inhibit the growth of 90% of major pathogens of endophthalmitis (mic90), such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis associated with poor prognosis, other than staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) in vitro. the gflx concentrations found in aqueous humor samples were sufficient to kill bacteria other than s. epidermidis, p. aeruginosa, and mrsa in vitro.

TI  == activity of meropenem as serine carbapenemases evolve in us medical centers: monitoring report from the mystic program (2006).
AB  == the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection (mystic) surveillance program was designed to monitor the antimicrobial potency and spectrum of meropenem, and selected broad-spectrum comparison agents against pathogens from hospitalized patients. in the 2006 (year 8 of the study) united states sample, a total of 2841 isolates (94.7% compliance) including 641 escherichia coli, 619 klebsiella spp., 606 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 456 oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, 300 streptococci, 149 enterococcus faecalis, and 70 gram-positive anaerobic organisms were tested by reference broth microdilution or agar dilution susceptibility methods. the carbapenems, especially meropenem, consistently demonstrated the lowest resistance rates against enterobacteriaceae strains, and the fluoroquinolones had the highest and  increasing resistance rates. the presence of qnr-mediated fluoroquinolone resistance was investigated using polymerase chain reaction methods but was only  observed at very low levels (2.1%) and was not clonally associated. confirmed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase rates for e. coli and klebsiella spp. were only  4.8% and 5.0%, respectively, with mobile ampc (cmy-2 and fox-5) enzymes shown in  13 additional enterobacteriaceae isolates. clonally related kpc-type serine carbapenemase production (57 strains, 9.5%) was observed at a rate 2-fold greater than the prior year among klebsiella spp. isolates, primarily from 1 geographic region (middle atlantic states). these mystic program (2006) results demonstrate  the continued need to monitor the carbapenem class potency and spectrum of activity against enterobacteriaceae as well as p. aeruginosa because of the documented presence of serine carbapenemases and rare incidence of metallo-beta-lactamases that may further compromise their activity and that of other beta-lactam agents.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of silver-containing dressings on wound microorganisms using an in vitro biofilm model.
AB  == antimicrobial dressings such as those containing silver are now being used widely to control wound bioburden, and tests to demonstrate their efficacy predominantly involve in vitro models using free-living or planktonic bacteria. in this present study a wide range of antibiotic-sensitive and resistant bacteria were tested in  their quasi-sessile state using a standard agar assay and a second method used a  poloxamer gel (true biofilm state - poloxamer encourages microorganisms to exhibit a more clinically relevant biofilm phenotype) technique. the antimicrobial activity of two silver dressings, a silver-containing hydrofiber (sch) dressing and a nanocrystalline silver-containing dressing (ncs), were evaluated on a variety of microorganisms, using a zone-of-inhibition (zoi) test.  when grown on agar (presenting a quasi-sessile state of each organism), the antibiotic-susceptible microorganisms were generally more susceptible to the sch  dressing compared with the ncs. zois associated with sch dressing ranged between  5.7 and 17.5 mm; those for the ncs against the same group of organisms ranged between 1.9 and 8.6 mm. when grown on poloxamer gel, (presenting the biofilm state of each organism) the same group of microorganisms were less susceptible to both dressings. the sch dressing was most effective against strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and staphylococcus aureus (zoi range: 2.6-6 mm); the ncs was most effective against strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and escherichia coli (i.e. zoi range: 1-2.8 mm). similarly  to the antibiotic-susceptible microorganisms, nine of ten antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains when grown on agar were more susceptible to the sch dressing compared with the ncs. although the microorganisms tested were universally less susceptible to the silver dressings when in their biofilm state, in the majority  of cases, the sch dressing demonstrated greater biofilm-inhibiting activity than  the ncs.

TI  == antiviral and antimicrobial activities of three sesquiterpene lactones from centaurea solstitialis l. ssp. solstitialis.
AB  == three sesquiterpene lactones (centaurepensin = chlorohyssopifolin a, chlorojanerin and 13-acetyl solstitialin a) isolated from the aerial parts of centaurea solstitialis l. ssp. solstitialis (asteraceae) were investigated for antimicrobial and antiviral activities. for the antimicrobial activity assessment, both standard and isolated strains of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans and c. parapsilosis were employed by the microdilution method. herpes simplex type-1, a  dna virus, and parainfluenza, an rna virus, were employed for the determination of the antiviral activity of these three sesquiterpene lactones using vero cell lines. ampicilline, ofloxocine, ketoconazole, fluconazole, acyclovir and oseltamivir were used as the reference drugs. 13-acetyl solstitialin a displayed  remarkable antibacterial activity against isolated strains of e. faecalis at 1 microg/ml concentration, which was close to the effective concentrations of ampicillin. the same compound also showed significant activity against the dna virus, being as potent as the reference compound acyclovir at maximum and minimum concentrations of 16-<0.00006 microg/ml. this is the first report showing that 13-acetyl solstitialin a possesses significant antiviral activity.

TI  == comparison of the antibacterial activity of honey from different provenance against bacteria usually isolated from skin wounds.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of honey samples provided by apiarists and honey packers was tested against microorganisms usually isolated from skin wounds. the  antibacterial activity was tested using the well-agar diffusion assay. the honey  samples were tested without dilution, and at 75, 50, 30, and 10% (w/v) dilution.  most of the undiluted honey samples inhibited the growth of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. some honey samples provided by apiarists also inhibited the growth of s. aureus even at 50% dilution. undiluted honey samples also inhibited the growth of staphylococcus uberis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae, although to a lesser extent. no inhibition of micrococcus luteus and enterococcus faecalis growth was detected. the diameters of the inhibition zones generated by honey samples provided by apiarists were larger than those generated by honey samples provided by honey packers. this observation may be explained by considering the provenance of the honey samples.

TI  == bactericidal and cytotoxic effects of chloramine-t on wound pathogens and human fibroblasts in vitro.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate cytotoxicity and bactericidal effects of chloramine-t. methods: in vitro study of various concentrations and exposure times to preparations containing human fibroblasts or 1.5 x 10 colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) of 3 gram-positive bacteria-staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis-and 2 gram-negative bacteria-escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa-with and without fetal bovine serum present. main outcome measures: percentage reduction of bacterial growth and percentage of viable fibroblasts 48  hours after exposure. results: all gram-positive growth was reduced by 95% to 100%, regardless of dose, with or without serum. e coli (gram-negative; with/without serum) was reduced 94% to 100% at antiseptic concentrations of 300 and 400 ppm. at 200 ppm, e coli growth was fully inhibited without serum present  and by 50% with serum. p aeruginosa (gram-negative) was not significantly affected under any conditions. at 100 and 200 ppm, cell viability remained greater than 90% under all experimental conditions. a 300-ppm, 3-minute exposure  to chloramine-t resulted in cell viability of up to 70%, with longer exposures producing lower viabilities. serum did not affect cell viability in any condition. conclusions: in vitro, chloramine-t at 200 ppm for 5 to 20 minutes was effective against 3 virulent gram-positive bacteria without fibroblast damage. at 300 ppm and 3 and 5 minutes, 30% of fibroblasts were damaged and 95% to 100 % of  e coli were inhibited, respectively.

TI  == urinary tract infections in brescia, italy: etiology of uropathogens and antimicrobial resistance of common uropathogens.
AB  == background: urinary tract infections are associated with substantial morbidity and recurrent infections. antibiotic therapy is generally initiated empirically because early treatment decreases the rate of morbidity resulting from uti. unfortunately, antibiotic resistance has become an increasingly pressing problem  in many countries. in this study, the resistance patterns of urinary isolates to  commonly used antimicrobials were determined in order to evaluate the options for empirical antibiotic therapy of uti in out- and in- patients. material/methods: a retrospective study was carried out on urine samples examined in this laboratory  in 2002-2005. the isolates were divided into the following three groups: isolates from hospital inpatients, isolates from community outpatients, and isolates from  catheterized patients. results: escherichia coli was the most common etiologic agent isolated, followed by enterococcus faecalis and klebsiella pneumoniae. over the four-year period, a decrease in the isolation of pseudomonas aeruginosa and a parallel increase in candida spp. in hospitalized patients were observed. against gram-positive isolates, enterococci in particular, ampicillin and glycopeptides demonstrated the best, most consistent activity. among escherichia coli isolates, nitrofurantoin, cephalosporins, and penicillin/betalactams were the best options  for therapeutic treatment because of the presence of a rate of resistance to cotrimoxazole and fluoroquinolones of over 10%, while the most active drug against pseudomonas aeruginosa was piperacillin/tazobactam. conclusions: region-specific surveillance studies provide additional information about the type of pathogens causing utis and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. therefore, these data can serve as a basis to develop national country-specific guidelines for the empirical treatment of utis.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of seven hypericum entities from central italy.
AB  == methanol-acetone extracts from aerial parts of seven entities of the genus hypericum [h. perforatum l. subsp. perforatum, h. perforatum l. subsp. veronense  (schrank) ces., h. montanum l., h. hyssopifolium chaix, h. hirsutum l., h. hircinum l. subsp. majus (aiton) n. robson, h. tetrapterum fr.] growing in the appennino umbro-marchigiano (central italy) were tested in vitro for their antimicrobial activity against two gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus  and enterococcus faecalis), two gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and the yeast candida albicans, by the kirby-bauer agar diffusion method. the two h. perforatum subspecies were particularly active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, supporting the use of these plants in the traditional medicine of central italy to treat wounds, skin and infectious diseases. however significant values of inhibition were given also by  h. hirsutum against s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, and by h. hyssopifolium, h. hircinum subsp. majus and h. tetrapterum against c. albicans. these results suggest that hypericin and hyperforin are the main components responsible for antimicrobial activity, but not the only ones, as other extracts, showing a low level of these compounds, possess evident activity. isolation of pure compounds from the most active extracts is in progress.

TI  == resistance to disinfectants in epidemiologically defined clinical isolates of acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == decreased susceptibility to biocides may contribute to epidemic spread of acinetobacter baumannii in the hospital. this study was conducted to evaluate the susceptibility of different clinical a. baumannii strains to disinfectants. twenty a. baumannii strains were examined, ten of which were outbreak-related and ten that were sporadic. clinical isolates were selected on the basis of demonstrating a unique pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern. the in-vitro activities of propanol, combination of 1-propanol, 2-propanol and mecetronium ethylsulphate, polyvinylpyrrolidone (pvp)-iodine, triclosan and chlorhexidine were determined using a broth macrodilution method. exposure times to the disinfectant ranged from 15 s to 2 min and concentrations ranged from undiluted to a 1:4000 dilution in order to investigate the impact of inadvertent dilution that might occur in clinical practice. five american type culture collection (atcc) type strains (a. baumannii, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus) were used as controls. all disinfectants inhibited growth of all isolates at concentrations and contact times recommended by the respective manufacturer. with most of the disinfectants  tested, a relevant number of viable bacteria remained if contact times < 30s or diluted agents were used. no significant differences in susceptibility between outbreak-related and sporadic strains were detected, but larger studies would be  required to confirm this. resistance to currently used disinfectants is probably  not a major factor in the epidemic spread of a. baumannii. however, even minor deviations from the recommended procedures leading to decreased concentrations or exposure times may play a role in nosocomial cross-transmission.

TI  == comparative in vitro antimicrobial activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline compound, in freshly prepared medium and quality control.
AB  == the in vitro spectra of activity of tigecycline and tetracycline were determined  for 2,490 bacterial isolates representing 50 different species or phenotypic groups. all isolates were tested simultaneously by broth microdilution using freshly prepared mueller-hinton broth and by disk diffusion. portions of these data were submitted to the food and drug administration (fda) in support of the sponsor's application for new drug approval. in a separate study, mic and disk diffusion quality control ranges were determined. the tigecycline mics at which 50%/90% of bacteria were inhibited were (in microg/ml) as follows: for streptococcus spp., 0.06/0.12; for moraxella catarrhalis, 0.06/0.12; for staphylococcus spp., 0.12/0.25; for enterococcus spp., 0.12/0.25; for listeria monocytogenes, 0.12/0.12; for neisseria meningitidis, 0.12/0.25; for haemophilus  spp., 0.25/0.5; for enterobacteriaceae, 0.05/2.0; for non-enterobacteriaceae, 0.5/8.0. tigecycline was consistently more potent than tetracycline against all species studied. the data from this study confirm the fda-approved mic and disk diffusion breakpoints for tigecycline for streptococcus spp. other than streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococci, and enterobacteriaceae. provisional breakpoints for haemophilus spp. and s. pneumoniae are proposed based on the data from this study. the following mic and/or disk diffusion quality control ranges are proposed: staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213, 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml; s. aureus atcc 25923, 20 to 25 mm; escherichia coli atcc 25922, 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml and  20 to 27 mm; pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, 9 to 13 mm, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, 0.03 to 0.12 microg/ml; s. pneumoniae atcc 49619, 0.015 to 0.12 microg/ml and 23 to 29 mm; haemophilus influenzae atcc 49247, 0.06 to 0.5 microg/ml and 23 to 31 mm; and neisseria gonorrhoeae atcc 49226, 30 to 40 mm.

TI  == in-vitro profile of a new beta-lactam, ceftobiprole, with activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == ceftobiprole is a novel, broad-spectrum cephalosporin with in-vitro activity against common gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. it forms a stable inhibitory complex with staphylococcus aureus penicillin-binding protein (pbp) 2' (2a), resulting in enhanced activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). in recent studies of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, the ceftobiprole  mic(90) value was most frequently < or =1.0 mg/l (mic range < or =0.25-1.0 mg/l). for mrsa, mic(90) values were generally 2.0 mg/l (mic range < or =0.06-4.0 mg/l). mics for all streptococcal species, except penicillin-resistant streptococcus viridans but including penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, ranged from < or =0.008 to 2.0 mg/l. ceftobiprole is active against enterococcus faecalis (mic(90) = 4 mg/l), but not generally active against enterococcus faecium (mic(90) > 16 mg/l). ceftobiprole displayed bactericidal activity against gram-negative pathogens comparable to that of cefepime, ceftazidime or piperacillin-tazobactam in early studies. however, recent data show activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa similar to that of cefepime but less than that of  ceftazidime. ceftobiprole, like cefepime, is stable in the presence of most class a non-extended spectrum beta-lactamases and inducible class c beta-lactamases. ceftobiprole is a poor inducer of ampc beta-lactamase and a poor substrate for hydrolysis by ampc beta-lactamase. studies of ceftobiprole in several animal models have demonstrated potent in-vivo efficacy against infections caused by mrsa, including strains intermediately resistant to vancomycin. it was also efficacious in murine infections caused by gram-negative bacteria with mic values < or =2 mg/l. the broad spectrum of activity demonstrated by ceftobiprole in vitro and in vivo suggests that it may have potential for empirical treatment of  suspected gram-negative and gram-positive infections, including those caused by mrsa.

TI  == vapor-phase activities of cinnamon, thyme, and oregano essential oils and key constituents against foodborne microorganisms.
AB  == the aim of the study presented here was to gain knowledge about the vapor-phase antimicrobial activity of selected essential oils and their major putatively active constituents against a range of foodborne bacterial and fungal strains. in a first step, the vapor-phase antimicrobial activities of three commercially available essential oils (eos)-cinnamon (cinnamomum zeylanicum), thyme (thymus vulgaris), and oregano (origanum vulgare)-were evaluated against a wide range of  microorganisms, including gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella choleraesuis), gram-positive bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis), molds (penicillium islandicum and aspergillus flavus), and a yeast (candida albicans). the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were generally lower for oregano eo than for the thyme and cinnamon eos, especially against the relatively resistant gram-negative. the persistence of the eos' antimicrobial activities over time was assessed, and changes in the composition of the atmosphere they generated over time were determined using single-drop microextraction (sdme) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) and subsequent analysis of the data by principal component analysis (pca). more relevant chemicals were selected. in addition, the vapor-phase activities of putatively key constituents of the oils were screened against representative gram-positive (l. monocytogenes) and gram-negative (s. choleraesuis) bacteria, a mold (a. flavus), and a yeast (c. albicans). of the tested compounds, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and carvacrol showed the strongest antimicrobial effectiveness, so their mics, defined as the minimum vapor concentrations that completely inhibited detectable growth of the microorganisms, were calculated. to check for possible interactions between components present in the eos, cinnamon eo was fortified with cinnamaldehyde and thyme eo with thymol,  and then the antimicrobial activities of the fortified oils were compared to those of the respective unfortified eos using fractional inhibitory concentration (fic) indices and by plotting inhibition curves as functions of the vapor-phase concentrations. synergistic effects were detected for cinnamaldehyde on a. flavus and for thymol on l. monocytogenes, s. choleraesuis, and a. flavus. in all other  cases the fortification had additive effects, except for cinnamaldehyde's activity against s. choleraesuis, for which the effect was antagonistic. finally, various microorganisms were found to cause slight changes over time to the atmospheres generated by all of the eos (fortified and unfortified) except the fortified cinnamon eo.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

AB  == platelet-rich plasma is a new inductive therapy which is being increasingly used  for the treatment of the complications of bone healing, such as infection and nonunion. the activator for platelet-rich plasma is a mixture of thrombin and calcium chloride which produces a platelet-rich gel. we analysed the antibacterial effect of platelet-rich gel in vitro by using the platelet-rich plasma samples of 20 volunteers. in vitro laboratory susceptibility to platelet-rich gel was determined by the kirby-bauer disc-diffusion method. baseline antimicrobial activity was assessed by measuring the zones of inhibition on agar plates coated with selected bacterial strains. zones of inhibition produced by platelet-rich gel ranged between 6 mm and 24 mm (mean 9.83 mm) in diameter. platelet-rich gel inhibited the growth of staphylococcus aureus and was also active against escherichia coli. there was no activity against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. moreover, platelet-rich gel seemed to induce the in vitro growth of ps. aeruginosa, suggesting that it may cause an exacerbation of infections with this organism. we believe that a combination of the inductive and antimicrobial properties of platelet-rich gel can improve the treatment of infected delayed healing and nonunion.

TI  == effect of ovotransferrin, protamine sulfate and edta combination on biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria.
AB  == aims: to determine the effect of a composition comprising ovotransferrin (ot), protamine sulfate (ps) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta) on biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria. methods and results: the in vitro activity of ot, ps and edta alone and in combinations against biofilm formation by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus epidermidis was investigated. all the three compounds either alone or in combinations failed to inhibit the growth completely at the concentrations tested. however, the subinhibitory concentrations of three compounds in a composition showed synergistic inhibitory  effect on biofilm formation by k. pneumoniae, ps. aeruginosa and s. epidermidis.  furthermore, 79-95% reduction in ps. aeruginosa and s. epidermidis biofilm formation was observed in a clear vinyl urinary catheter treated with the composition. conclusion: the subinhibitory concentrations of ot, ps and edta in a composition were effective in reducing biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria. significance and impact of the study: this study shows that a synergistic composition-comprising non-antibiotic generally regarded as safe (gras) compounds such as ot, ps and edta may be used in the prevention of catheter-related infections.

TI  == bacterial isolates from severe infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in italy: a nationwide study in the hospital setting.
AB  == the most frequent agents of severe bacterial infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns were determined in patients admitted to 45 italian hospitals over the years 2002-2003. the most common diagnoses were: sepsis (33.8%), pneumonia (9.4%), intravascular catheter-associated infections (9.3%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (8.1%). overall, 5115 bacterial isolates were identified from 4228 patients. three bacterial species, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli, accounted for more than 50% of the isolates. other prevalent bacterial isolates were staphylococcus epidermidis and  enterococcus faecalis, while acinetobacter baumanii ranked third among all intensive care unit (icu) isolates. 7% of s. aureus had intermediate resistance to vancomycin. although e. faecalis displayed no vancomycin resistance, 34% of vancomycin-resistant isolates were found among enterococcus faecium, one of the highest rates found to date, emphasizing the difference between these two enterococcal species. all the gram-positive pathogens were susceptible to linezolid, with the exception of approximately 2% of the enterococcal isolates that were intermediate with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)=4 microg/ml. almost 10% of escherichia coli, 14% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 22% of serratia marcescens and 50% of enterobacter cloacae were non-susceptible to cefotaxime. amikacin was the most active antibiotic against p. aeruginosa that showed lack of susceptibility to ceftazidime, gentamicin, piperacillin and ciprofloxacin ranging from 20 to 35%. finally, acinetobacter baumanii showed a high level of resistance to all the antibiotics tested including imipenem (58%). the results obtained in this study, the first of its kind in italy, offer indications for guiding empirical therapy and implementing specific interventions to fight antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and their transmission in the hospital  setting in italy.

TI  == catheter associated infections in hemodialysis patients.
AB  == hemodialysis catheter related infections (hcri) are one of the major causes of increasing mortality, morbidity and cost of therapy in hemodialysis patients. prevention of hcri requires the identification of predisposing risk factors. to determine the frequency of hcri risk factors, we studied 116 patients (54% male,  mean age of 49.5+/-16 years) patients with hcri between 2003-2004. forty one percent of the patients were diabetic. there was a history of previous catheter placement and infection in 41% and 32% of patients, respectively. pathogenic organisms isolated from blood cultures included staphylococcus-aureus 42%, coagulase-negative staphylococci 20%, e. coli 19%, enterococci 7%, streptococcus  d 7%, pseudomonas aeruginosa 4%, and klebsiella 1%. bacterial resistance to vancomycin and amikacin was present in 7% and 4% of the cases, respectively. hemodialysis catheter related blood borne infections comprised 67% of the total blood-borne infections in our hospital. no significant statistical association was found between hcri and age, gender, diabetes mellitus, serum albumin level <30 g/l, leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anatomical location of  catheter, mean duration of antibiotic therapy, mean catheter duration, frequency  of hemodialysis sessions, pathogenic organisms, and history of previous catheter  infection. we conclude that the prevalence of pathogenic organisms of hcri were similar to previous studies. however, bacterial resistance to antibiotics was low. the mean duration of catheter usage was longer than previously reported.

TI  == histidine-rich glycoprotein exerts antibacterial activity.
AB  == histidine-rich glycoprotein (hrgp), an abundant heparin-binding protein found in  plasma and thrombocytes, exerts antibacterial effects against gram-positive bacteria (enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa). fluorescence studies and  electron microscopy to assess membrane permeation showed that hrgp induces lysis  of e. faecalisbacteria in the presence of zn2+ or at low ph. heparin blocked binding of the protein to e. faecalis and abolished antibacterial activity. furthermore, truncated hrgp, devoid of the heparin-binding and histidine-rich domain, was not antibacterial. it has previously been shown that peptides containing consensus heparin-binding sequences (cardin and weintraub motifs) are  antibacterial. thus, the peptide (ghhph)4, derived from the histidine-rich region of hrgp and containing such a heparin-binding motif, was antibacterial for e. faecalis in the presence of zn2+ or at low ph. the results show a previously undisclosed antibacterial activity of hrgp and suggest that the histidine-rich and heparin-binding domain of hrgp mediates the antibacterial activity of the protein.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of crude extracts from plants bryophyllum pinnatum and kalanchoe crenata.
AB  == extracts from the leaves of bryophyllum pinnatum and kalanchoe crenata were screened for their antimicrobial activities. solvents used included water, methanol, and local solvents such as palmwine, local gin (seaman's schnapps 40% alcoholic drink,) and "omi ekan-ogi" (sour water from 3 days fermented milled maize). leaves were dried and powdered before being soaked in solvents for 3 days. another traditional method of extraction by squeezing raw juice from the leaves was also employed. all extracts were lyophilized. these extracts were tested against some gram-negative organisms (escherichia coli atcc 25922, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella flexneri, salmonella paratyphi, citrobacter spp); gram-positive organisms staphylococcus aureus atcc 25213, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis) and a fungus (candida albicans). agar well diffusion and broth dilution methods were used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) at concentrations of 512 mg/ml to 4 mg/ml. all the organisms except candida albicans were susceptible to the extracts obtained from the traditional method. the squeezed-leaf juice of kalanchoe crenata was the most active one with mic of 8 mg/ml against pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and bacillus subtilis, 32 mg/ml against shigella flexneri, 64 mg/ml against escherichia coli and 128 mg/ml against the control strain staphylococcus aureus while its mbc is 256 mg/ml against these organisms except bacillus subtilis and klebsiella pneumoniae. the gram-positive organisms were more sensitive to the methanol and local gin-extract of bryophyllum pinnatum. extracts from other solvents showed moderate to weak activity.

AB  == the antimicrobial activities of crude dichloromethane fractions from acetone extracts of agrobacterium rhizogenes transformed roots and roots of field-grown plants of salvia sclarea as well as four pure abietane diterpenoids isolated from the hairy root cultures were determined. the growth of gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis) but not gram-negative ones (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa) or pathogenic fungi (candida albicans) was inhibited by fractions tested at concentrations of 37.5-75.0 microgml(-1). abietane diterpenoids: salvipisone, aethiopinone, 1-oxoaethiopinone and ferruginol were shown to be bacteriostatic as well as bacteriocidal for the cultures of s. aureus and s. epidermidis strains, regardless of their antibiotic susceptibility profile. this was demonstrated by using simultaneously the optical density measuring method and 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide-reduction assay. the highest activity was shown by salvipisone which demonstrated also a very interesting activity when its effect on 24-h-old staphylococcal biofilm cells viability was examined. it limited the survival of biofilms formed by s. aureus as well as by s. epidermidis, putting this compound to the list of potential anti-biofilm agents, better than most of known antibiotics.

TI  == gata transcription factor required for immunity to bacterial and fungal pathogens.
AB  == in the past decade, caenorhabditis elegans has been used to dissect several genetic pathways involved in immunity; however, little is known about transcription factors that regulate the expression of immune effectors. c. elegans does not appear to have a functional homolog of the key immune transcription factor nf-kappab. here we show that that the intestinal gata transcription factor elt-2 is required for both immunity to salmonella enterica and expression of a c-type lectin gene, clec-67, which is expressed in the intestinal cells and is a good marker of s. enterica infection. we also found that elt-2 is required for immunity to pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, and cryptococcus neoformans. lack of immune inhibition by daf-2, which  negatively regulates the foxo transcription factor daf-16, rescues the hypersusceptibility to pathogens phenotype of elt-2(rnai) animals. our results indicate that elt-2 is part of a multi-pathogen defense pathway that regulates innate immunity independently of the daf-2/daf-16 signaling pathway.

TI  == comparison of bactec plus blood culture media to bact/alert fa blood culture media for detection of bacterial pathogens in samples containing therapeutic levels of antibiotics.
AB  == blood culture bottles with antimicrobial removal systems are recommended for patients who develop fever while on antibiotics. this study compared the ability  of becton dickinson (sparks, md) bactec plus bottles and biomerieux (durham, nc)  bact/alert fa bottles to effectively remove vancomycin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin, oxacillin, gentamicin, and a combination of gentamicin/penicillin, thus allowing bacterial pathogens to grow.  each bottle was spiked with 10 ml of human blood, antibiotic, and strains of organisms susceptible to the antibiotic evaluated. the organisms used were type strains and clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible and resistant), streptococcus pneumoniae, a viridans streptococcus, enterococcus  faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. testing was completed in triplicate, using 10 to 100 cfu/ml of organisms with various concentrations of each antibiotic. two rounds of testing were completed per antibiotic/organism combination. bottles were mixed and loaded onto their respective instruments as per the manufacturer's instructions. antimicrobial removal was evaluated on the basis of time to detection of organism growth, for up to 5 days of incubation. overall, the bact/alert fa system recovered 25.1% of strains from test bottles and 96.9% of strains from growth control bottles (no antibiotic added), and the bactec plus system recovered 95.1% of strains from test bottles and 100% of strains from growth control bottles. both systems performed well in the detection of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of gentamicin. in the presence of ceftriaxone, neither system was able to recover streptococcus pneumoniae. the ability to remove vancomycin and cefoxitin was also determined by measuring antibiotic levels remaining in bottles after 1 h of incubation. the results demonstrated remaining levels of 72 to 90% of vancomycin and 71 to 72% of cefoxitin in the bact/alert system. for the bactec system, remaining levels were 0 to 30% of vancomycin and 0% of cefoxitin. under these simulated conditions, the bactec plus system was superior to the bact/alert fa system in recovering gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics, gentamicin/penicillin, and vancomycin.

TI  == effect of solar radiation on survival of indicator bacteria in bathing waters.
AB  == sunlight exposure is considered to be the most important cause of "natural disinfection" in surface water environments. the uv-b portion of the solar spectrum is the most bactericidal, causing direct (photo-biological) dna damage.  in the present experimental study, the effect of solar radiation on the elimination of bacteria in water, especially in surface water, was studied. the influence of depth and uv-b transmittance of water was determined. comparing escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis proved to be the most resistant organism. pseudomonas aeruginosa was shown to be the most sensitive indicator bacterium among the tested microorganisms. results show a significant correlation between radiation intensity and reduction rates. best elimination of microorganisms occurs on the water surface; with increasing water depth, there is less uv radiation to inactivate bacteria. high turbidity substantially reduces uv-b transmittance in water causing decreased elimination efficiency. the results of the present study show that sunlight, given an appropriate intensity and good  water transparency is suitable to inactivate fecal indicator bacteria within a few hours in surface waters and therefore also in bathing waters.

AB  == background and purpose: ureteral stents are commonly used in urology today, but the biofilms that form on them within hours of placement may harbor bacteria that can result in infection or encrustation. triclosan is an antimicrobial commonly used in consumer and medical products that inhibits bacterial fatty-acid synthesis. the bactericidal and bacteriostatic effect of a triclosan-eluting ureteral stent was tested against clinical isolates of common bacterial uropathogens in an in-vitro setting. materials and methods: triclosan eluted from a drug-loaded ureteral stent was suspended in artificial urine with bacterial pathogens (escherichia coli c1214, proteus mirabilis 296, enterococcus faecalis 1131, klebsiella pneumoniae 280, staphylococcus aureus newman, pseudomonas aeruginosa ak1) to assess growth, virulence-promoter activity, and bacterial adherence to the stent. generic stents were utilized as controls. results: triclosan inhibited the growth of e. faecalis, k. pneumoniae, s. aureus, and p. mirabilis in a dose-dependent manner. pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance. lower concentrations of triclosan downregulated e. coli virulence-factor promoters of outer membrane protein x and p-fimbriae. triclosan  stents had significantly fewer adherent viable bacteria than control stents. conclusions: triclosan-eluting ureteral stents inhibit the growth of common bacterial uropathogens and thus may reduce the incidence of urinary-tract infections and, potentially, encrustation. this drug-eluting stent provides both  mechanical drainage of the upper urinary tract and local antibiosis.

TI  == structure-antimicrobial activity relationship for silanols, a new class of disinfectants, compared with alcohols and phenols.
AB  == triorganosilanols (r(ch(3))(2)sioh) were recently reported to exhibit unexpectedly strong disinfectant properties. the antimicrobial activities of silanols were significantly higher than their analogous alcohols. a study of the  structural dependence of their antimicrobial activity was conducted against four  bacteria, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis. silanols, alcohols with structures analogous to the silanols (r(ch(3))(2)coh) and substituted phenols were evaluated as a single class of materials. the minimum lethal concentrations (mlcs), defined as the concentration required for a 7-log reduction in viable bacteria after 1h exposure, were used to measure antimicrobial activity. octanol-water partition coefficients (logp) and hydrogen bond acidities (deltanu), measured as the shift  in frequency of the oh stretching band between free oh and hydrogen-bonded oh to  diethyl ether oxygen by infrared spectroscopy, were utilised as dispersive and polar structural parameters, respectively. the correlation established by multiple regression analysis between antimicrobial activities and structural properties of silanols, alcohols and phenols against the four bacteria treated as a single family produced the following equation, log(1/mlc)=0.679 logp+0.0036deltanu-1.909 (n=282, r=0.96, s=0.22). this equation and the significantly high correlation coefficient supported the hypothesis that the lipophilic properties and the h-bond acidities are primary factors for the antimicrobial action of silanols, alcohols and phenols. the high antimicrobial activity of silanols is explained by their greater h-bond acidity and their enhanced lipophilicity.

AB  == the bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa) isolated from patients diagnosed as urinary tract infections (utis) in 14 institutions in japan were collected between august 2004 and july 2005. the susceptibilities of these bacteria to various antimicrobial agents were measured. the bacteria were divided into 2 groups consisting of uncomplicated utis and complicated utis (with and without indwelling catheter) based on their isolation origins. the results were compared  with those obtained between 1995 and 2003. the drug sensitivity of s. aureus in this year was similar to those in up to the previous year and s. aureus showed the best susceptibility to vancomycin (vcm) and arbekacin (abk). the drug sensitivity of e. faecalis in this year also was similar to those in up to the previous year. the susceptibility of e. coli to cephems in this year was generally good and was similar to those in up to the previous year. mic90 of cefozopran (czop) was the most stable and 0.125 microg/ml or less since 1995. the susceptibility of e. coli to cefpirome (cpr) and cefotiam (ctm) also was good but to cefaclor (ccl), cefixime (cfix), and cefpodoxime (cpdx) was largely decreased  in complicated uti groups. the sensitivity of e. coli to carbapenems also was good but to carumonam (crmn) tended to decrease. the susceptibility of e. coli to quinolones, however, has largely changed and has decreased since 2003 in uncomplicated utis and 2000 in complicated utis. that was suggested the development of the resistance to the drug. the susceptibility of klebsiella spp.  to cefazolin (cez), ctm, ccl, cpdx, and cefditoren (cdtr) decreased in the previous year and recovered to the year before the previous year in this year. the susceptibility of klebsiella spp. to other cephems was stable since 1995, especially against czop, the highest sensitivity (mic90: < or = 0.125 microg/ml)  was maintained. the susceptibility of klebsiella spp. to carbapenems and crmn also was good. the susceptibility of klebsiella spp. to aminoglycosides was lower than to czop but was stable since 1995. the susceptibility of p. aeruginosa was generally low and has largely changed against the majority of the agents since 1995. the susceptibility of p. aeruginosa isolated from uncomplicated utis has largely changed against ceftazidime (caz), cefsulodin (cfs), czop, imipenem (ipm), meropenem (mepm), aztreonam (azt), crmn, gentamicin (gm), and tobramycin (tob). the susceptibility of p. aeruginosa isolated from complicated utis has largely changed against csf, czop, mepm, gm, and ciprofloxacin (cpfx). the susceptibility of p. aeruginosa isolated from complicated utis has been stable against amikacin (amk). for annual changes in mic50, tob and ipm had a relatively stable and high activity (mic50: 0.5-2 microg/ml).

TI  == automated washing with the reliance endoscope processing system and its equivalence to optimal manual cleaning.
AB  == background: manual cleaning of flexible endoscopes is prone to error. to date, attempts to automate this process have been unsuccessful. the aim of this project was to compare the efficacy of the washing phase in the new reliance eps (steris  corp, mentor, oh) with that of optimal manual cleaning. methods: using simulated-use testing, all channels in 3 different flexible endoscopes, including a bronchoscope (pentax, pentax medical company, miami, fl), a side-viewing duodenoscope (olympus, olympus corporation), and a colonoscope (fujinon, fujinon  corporation, wayne, nj) were evaluated. all of the channels in the flexible endoscope were soiled with artificial test soil (ats) (test soil that mimics the  worst case levels of hemoglobin, protein, carbohydrate, and endotoxin from patient-used flexible endoscopes) containing 10(8) cfu/ml of enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa the soiled scopes were allowed to dry for 1 hour prior to processing. hemoglobin, protein, and viable organism counts for the flexible endoscopes were determined before and after cleaning. results: both the  reliance eps washing phase and optimal manual cleaning achieved >90% reduction of hemoglobin and protein, resulting in <6.4 microg/cm2 after the cleaning cycle. the reduction factor for viable organisms was not significantly different between the 2 methods, which ranged from 2.06 to 6.21 for manual cleaning and from 2.1 to 5.93 for the reliance eps washing phase. the mean reduction factor (all tests) was 4.32 +/- 1.03 for manual cleaning compared with 4.24 +/- 1.11 for reliance eps washing phase. conclusion: the efficacy of the reliance eps washing phase for flexible endoscopes was equivalent to optimal manual cleaning for all the makes and models of flexible endoscopes tested.

TI  == experimental evaluation of an automated endoscope reprocessor with in situ generation of peracetic acid for disinfection of semicritical devices.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the effectiveness of a high-level disinfection solution generated inside an endoscope processing system for decontaminating external and  internal surfaces of experimentally contaminated heat-sensitive medical devices.  methods: the american society for testing and materials simulated-use test protocol (e1837-02), which incorporates a soil load in each inoculum, was used to evaluate the efficacy of the system when processing 4 common types of endoscopes  contaminated separately with 5 types of nosocomial pathogens: pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 15442), spores of clostridium difficile (atcc 9689), a glutaraldehyde-resistant strain of mycobacterium chelonae, a vancomycin-resistant strain of enterococcus faecalis, and a methicillin-resistant strain of staphylococcus aureus. rinse solution samples from channels and from surfaces of  the processed endoscopes were tested for any microbicidal residues. results: for  all organisms tested, the baseline level of contamination of the endoscopes ranged from 5 log(10) to greater than 7 log(10) at each external surface site and internal channel. all tests showed reductions in viability of the test organisms  to undetectable levels. all rinse solution samples from external and internal sites of the endoscopes proved to be free of any residual microbicidal activity.  conclusions: the endoscope reprocessor, with its processor-generated high-level disinfection solution, successfully reduced the numbers of selected, clinically relevant pathogens to undetectable levels both in the channels and on the outside surfaces of the 4 representative endoscopes tested in this study.

TI  == high-level vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus isolates associated with a  polymicrobial biofilm.
AB  == glycopeptides such as vancomycin are the treatment of choice for infections due to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. this study describes the identification of high-level vancomycin-resistant s. aureus (vrsa) isolates in a  polymicrobial biofilm within an indwelling nephrostomy tube in a patient in new york. s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, micrococcus species, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated from the biofilm. for vrsa isolates, vancomycin mics ranged from 32 to >128 microg/ml. vrsa isolates were also resistant to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, penicillin, and tetracycline but remained susceptible to chloramphenicol, linezolid, rifampin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. the vana gene was localized to a plasmid of approximately 100 kb in vrsa and e. faecium isolates from the biofilm. plasmid analysis revealed that the vrsa isolate acquired the 100-kb e. faecium plasmid, which was then maintained without integration into the mrsa plasmid. the tetracycline resistance genes tet(u) and tet(s), not previously detected in s. aureus isolates, were identified in the vrsa isolates. additional resistance elements in the vrsa isolate included a multiresistance gene cluster, ermb-aade-sat4-apha-3, msra (macrolide efflux), and the bifunctional aminoglycoside resistance gene aac(6')-aph(2")-ia. multiple combinations of resistance genes among the various isolates of staphylococci and  enterococci, including vana, tet(s), and tet(u), illustrate the dynamic nature of gene acquisition and loss within and between bacterial species throughout the course of infection. the potential for interspecies transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes, including resistance to vancomycin, may be enhanced by the microenvironment of a biofilm.

TI  == sensitive quantitative detection of commensal bacteria by rrna-targeted reverse transcription-pcr.
AB  == a sensitive rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) method was developed for exact and sensitive enumeration of subdominant bacterial populations. using group- or species-specific primers for 16s or 23s rrna, analytical curves were constructed for escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the threshold cycle value was found to be linear up to an rna amount of 10(-3) cell per rt-pcr. the number of bacteria in culture was determined by rt-qpcr, and the results correlated well with the cfu count over the range from 10(0) to 10(5) cfu. the bacterial counts obtained by rt-qpcr were the same as the cfu counts irrespective of the growth phase in vitro, except for c. perfringens during starvation periods; the viable cell counts obtained by using a combination of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (dapi) staining and syto9-propidium iodide double staining were in good agreement with the rt-qpcr counts rather than with the cfu  counts. the rt-qpcr method could detect endogenous enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa in feces of hospitalized patients (n = 38) at a level of 10(3) cells per g of feces, and for enumeration of s. aureus or p. aeruginosa spiked into human peripheral blood, the lower detection limit for rt-qpcr quantification of the bacteria was 2 cells per ml of blood, suggesting that this method was equivalent to the conventional culture method. as only 5 h was needed for rt-qpcr quantification, we suggest that rrna-targeted rt-qpcr assays provide a sensitive  and convenient system for quantification of commensal bacteria and for examining  their possible invasion of a host.

TI  == high prevalence of ceftazidime-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae and increase of imipenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. in korea: a konsar program in 2004.
AB  == a nationwide antimicrobial resistance surveillance has been conducted since 1997  in korea. in this study, susceptibility test data generated in 2004 by konsar group hospitals were analyzed and compared to those at a commercial laboratory. in hospitals, the rank orders of organisms in 2004 were identical to those in 2003. the most prevalent species was staphylococcus aureus (20.2%) in hospitals,  but escherichia coli (29.7%) in the commercial laboratory. the proportions of enterococcus faecium to all isolates of enterococcus faecalis plus e. faecium were 47.2% in hospitals and 24.9% in the commercial laboratory. the mean resistance rates of significant antimicrobial-organism combinations in hospitals  were: oxacillin-resistant s. aureus (68%), oxacillin-resistant (penicillin- nonsusceptible) streptococcus pneumoniae (68%), vancomycin-resistant e. faecium (25%), cefotaxime-resistant e. coli (14%), ceftazidime- and cefoxitin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae (34% and 32%, respectively), and imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa (17% and 24%, respectively). in conclusion, oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant k. pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp.  and p. aeruginosa were prevalent in 2004. increasing trends were observed for vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, cefoxitin- resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae,  and imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. and p. aeruginosa. certain antimicrobial- organism combinations were also prevalent among the commercial laboratory-tested strains.

TI  == evaluation of inhibition and cross-reaction effects on real-time pcr applied to the total dna of wastewater samples for the quantification of bacterial antibiotic resistance genes and taxon-specific targets.
AB  == in order to evaluate the applicability of six primer and probe sets for taqman real-time rcr on dna of wastewater samples, effects of the sample matrix and dna  background on target quantification were studied with respect to differences between functional genes and taxonomically used rdna targets. primer/probe assays for real-time pcr (taqman) designed to quantitatively detect the antibiotic resistance genes bla(vim), vana, ampc, meca, and taxon-specific 23s rdna sequences for pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecium/faecalis were tested for their sensitivity and amplification robustness. the amplification of their gene targets in dna extracts of wastewater ("wastewater dna") and reference strains ("reference dna") was compared with their amplification in "model dna" which was composed of wastewater dna and reference dna. target detection was quantifiable along up to seven decimal orders of magnitude. for the detection of  the resistance genes bla(vim), vana, ampc, and meca as well as the enterococci directed pcr only weak or no inhibition due to the impurities or wastewater dna matrix were demonstrated for the applied target concentrations. the taxonomically applied detection system for the quantification of p. aeruginosa showed a limited performance. for the analysis of the amplification dynamics of possibly similar nucleotide sequences of organisms related to p. aeruginosa a sybr green assay was employed. competitive amplification of similar sequences was identified to be a major mechanism of reduced sensitivity. hence, the primers were modified for an optimised detection. with the resulting reduction of cross reactions an increased sensitivity was achieved for the detection and quantification of p. aeruginosa in wastewater dna.

TI  == evaluation of antimicrobial and antifungal effects of iodoform-integrating gutta-percha.
AB  == objective: the antibacterial and antifungal effects of medicated gutta-percha (mgp) over different time periods have not been evaluated. the aim of this study  was to evaluate and compare the antimicrobial and antifungal effectiveness of mgp and regular gutta-percha cones over different time periods using the disk diffusion method. methods: enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli were spread onto mueller-hinton agar,  and candida albicans was spread onto sabouraud agar supplemented with glucose. same-size mgp cones, conventional gutta-percha cones and disks impregnated with povidone-iodine were placed on the inoculated plates. the dishes were incubated at 37 degrees c aerobically. growth inhibition zones were inspected and measured  at 24, 48 and 72 hours. for each strain, experiments were performed in triplicate. the kruskal-wallis test was used to compare k independent samples. results: the disks impregnated with povidone-iodine inhibited all bacterial strains for up to 72 hours. no inhibition zones were seen around regular gutta-percha cones. mgp inhibited the growth of all bacteria over 24 hours, but in some cases these effects did not continue over longer periods. specifically, the antimicrobial properties of mgp cones against e. coli and p. aeruginosa disappeared by 48 and 72 hours. regardless of time and bacterial strain, mgp was  statistically more effective than regular gutta-percha (p < 0.05). povidone-iodine and mgp were effective against c. albicans for up to 72 hours, but regular gutta-percha exhibited no antifungal activity. conclusion: the antimicrobial and antifungal characteristics of mgp may offer additional advantages over conventional gutta-percha.

TI  == [towards new antibacterial drugs. interest of para-guanidinoethylcalix[4]arene].
AB  == we present here the results concerning the antibacterial properties evaluation of para-guanidinoethylcalix[4]arene, compared with its constitutive monomer, the para-guanidinoethylphenol, and hexamidine (hexomedine), an antiseptic from the diamidine family widely used in therapeutic, chosen as a reference in this study  for its resemblance in terms of functional groups. antibacterial activities of those three compounds were evaluated by microdilution methods, in mueller hinton  broth, onto 5 bacterial strains: escherichia coli atcc 25922, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 & atcc 29213 and enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, according to ca-sfm and clsi (formerly nccls) approved standards. in parallel, the effects of these three compounds on mrc-5 eukaryotic cell viability were evaluated with mtt assay. the results obtained here confirm a lack of activity for the monomer compound (mic> or =512 mg/l) and  a real antibacterial activity for the calixarene, comparable to hexamidine. this  activity is expressed, both on gram+and gram- bacteria (mic=4 mg/l for e. coli, 8 mg/l on both s. aureus strains) and at a lesser degree on e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa (mic=32 mg/l). similarly, both compounds, monomer and calixarene, slightly induce any modification on mrc-5 cells viability, and this until 168 h of treatment for concentrations reaching 10(-4) mol/l while hexamidine demonstrates a significant and increasing effect during the time of experiment and this for 100 to 1000 times lower concentrations. thus, this study tends to confirm the significance of the organization of the para-guanidinoethylphenol monomer into its cyclic calixarenic tetramer for the gain of an antibacterial activity, similar to a widely used antiseptic one.

TI  == in vitro activities of three carbapenems against recent bacterial isolates from severely ill patients at swedish hospitals.
AB  == to study the in vitro activity of imipenem, meropenem and ertapenem against common pathogens isolated from patients in intensive care, haematology and dialysis/nephrology units at 7 swedish university hospitals, a total of 788 isolates were collected during 2002-2003. the distribution of the isolates was as follows: escherichia coli (n = 140), klebsiella spp. (n = 132), proteus spp. (n = 97), enterobacter spp. (n = 113), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 126), acinetobacter spp. (n = 53) and enterococcus faecalis (n = 127). the susceptibility to the 3 carbapenems was determined by e-test, and the mics were interpreted according to  srga criteria. all 3 carbapenems were highly active against enterobacteriaceae. the overall susceptibility to imipenem, meropenem and ertapenem was 90%, 98% and  93%, respectively. against enterobacteriaceae, enterobacter spp. excluded, ertapenem had an equal or lower mic(90) than meropenem. apart from being the most active carbapenem against enterobacteriaceae, meropenem was also the most active  carbapenem against p. aeruginosa, whereas imipenem was the most active drug against acinetobacter spp. the carbapenems are still potent antibiotics. with the introduction of ertapenem, and an expected increase in the carbapenem consumption due to an increased prevalence of strains with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, continuous surveillance of carbapenem resistance appears to be warranted, with special attention to p. aeruginosa, enterobacter and proteus spp.

TI  == multiple bacterial species reside in chronic wounds: a longitudinal study.
AB  == the aim of the study was to investigate the bacterial profile of chronic venous leg ulcers and the importance of the profile to ulcer development. patients with  persisting venous leg ulcers were included and followed for 8 weeks. every second week, ulcer samples were collected and the bacterial species present were identified. more than one bacterial species were detected in all the ulcers. the  most common bacteria found were staphylococcus aureus (found in 93.5% of the ulcers), enterococcus faecalis (71.7%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (52.2%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (45.7%), proteus species (41.3%) and anaerobic bacteria (39.1%). resident bacterial species were present in all the ulcers. in 76% of the ulcers, two or more (up to five) resident bacterial species were found. the most common resident bacterial species were s. aureus and p. aeruginosa. furthermore, ulcers with p. aeruginosa were found to be significantly larger than ulcers without the presence of p. aeruginosa (p < 0.005). our study demonstrated that the chronic wound is colonised by multiple bacterial species and that once they are established many of them persist in the wound. our results suggest that the presence of p. aeruginosa in venous leg ulcers can induce ulcer  enlargement and/or cause delayed healing.

TI  == 1h nmr spectroscopy in the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae-induced urinary tract infection.
AB  == the (1)h nmr spectroscopic method is suggested and its utility is demonstrated for the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae) in urinary tract infection (uti). k. pneumoniae have the specific property of metabolizing glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-pd), acetate, ethanol and succinate. the quantity of 1,3-pd produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. other common bacteria causing uti (except for citrobacter frundii), such as escherichia coli (e. coli), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), enterobacter  aerogenes, acinetobacter baumanii, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus gp b and staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize glycerol under similar conditions. citrobacter frundii (c. frundii) also gives the same nmr results but is easily differentiated as being motile on direct microscopic examination of urine and it is not common nosocomial infectious agent in urinary  tract infection. the method provides a single-step documentation of k. pneumoniae (and c. frundii) qualitatively as well as quantitatively. out of the total 614 subjects considered, clinical diagnosis of uti was obtained in 516 cases (84%). the nmr-based screening had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 100% and a false negativity of 10% relative to the conventional quantitative culture method. in the present authors' experience, the results of nmr spectroscopy based screening show a very good correlation with the diagnosis of urinary tract infected patients.

TI  == heat-shock transcription factor (hsf)-1 pathway required for caenorhabditis elegans immunity.
AB  == innate immunity comprises physical barriers, pattern-recognition receptors, antimicrobial substances, phagocytosis, and fever. here we report that increased  temperature results in the activation of a conserved pathway involving the heat-shock (hs) transcription factor (hsf)-1 that enhances immunity in the invertebrate caenorhabditis elegans. the hsf-1 defense response is independent of the p38 mapk/pmk-1 pathway and requires a system of chaperones including small and 90-kda inducible hs proteins. in addition, hsf-1 is needed for the effects of the daf-2 insulin-like pathway in defense to pathogens, indicating that interacting pathways control stress response, aging, and immunity. the results also show that hsf-1 is required for c. elegans immunity against pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica, yersinia pestis, and enterococcus faecalis, indicating that hsf-1 is part of a multipathogen defense pathway. considering that several coinducers of hsf-1 are currently in clinical trials, this work opens the possibility that activation of hsf-1 could be used to boost immunity to treat infectious diseases and immunodeficiencies.

TI  == automated detection and quantitation of bacterial rna by using electrical microarrays.
AB  == low-density electrical 16s rrna specific oligonucleotide microarrays and an automated analysis system have been developed for the identification and quantitation of pathogens. the pathogens are escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis, which are typically involved in urinary tract infections. interdigitated gold array electrodes (ida-electrodes), which have structures in the nanometer range, have been used for very sensitive analysis. thiol-modified oligonucleotides are immobilized on the gold ida as capture probes. they mediate  the specific recognition of the target 16s rrna by hybridization. additionally three unlabeled oligonucleotides are hybridized in close proximity to the capturing site. they are supporting molecules, because they improve the rna hybridization at the capturing site. a biotin labeled detector oligonucleotide is also allowed to hybridize to the captured rna sequence. the biotin labels enable  the binding of avidin alkaline phophatase conjugates. the phosphatase liberates the electrochemical mediator p-aminophenol from its electrically inactive phosphate derivative. the electrical signals were generated by amperometric redox cycling and detected by a unique multipotentiostat. the read out signals of the microarray are position specific current and change over time in proportion to the analyte concentration. if two additional biotins are introduced into the affinity binding complex via the supporting oligonucleotides, the sensitivity of  the assays increase more than 60%. the limit of detection of escherichia coli total rna has been determined to be 0.5 ng/microl. the control of fluidics for variable assay formats as well as the multichannel electrical read out and data handling have all been fully automated. the fast and easy procedure does not require any amplification of the targeted nucleic acids by pcr.

TI  == [antimicrobial susceptibilities of organisms isolated from patients with urinary  tract infections in 2002].
AB  == using the agar dilution method, the antibacterial activity of 18 antibiotics inclusive of 4 carbapenems were investigated against 101 strains of urinary pathogens isolated from patients with urinary tract infections who visited the department of urology at kagoshima university hospital, between january and december 2002. 4 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 3 strains of staphylococcus spp. (exclusive of s. aureus), 14 strains of enterococcus faecalis, 3 strains of  enterococcus spp. (exclusive of e. faecalis), 41 strains of escherichia coli, 21  strains of enterobacteriaceae (exclusive of e. coli), 12 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 3 strains of glucose-nonfermentative gram-negative rods (exclusive of p. aeruginosa) were examined. 1. against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria, vancomycin and teicoplanin were active. additionally, arbekacin was active against s. aureus clinical isolates and ampicillin was active against e. faecalis clinical isolates. carbapenems were active against clinical isolates of  gram-positive bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains of gram-positive  bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant s. aureus. 2. as for clinical isolates of gram-negative bacteria, meropenem was most active against enterobacteriaceae among 13 antibiotics tested. against p. aeruginosa clinical isolates, mic90 of meropenem was the lowest among 13 antibiotics tested. in addition, resistant rate of meropenem and biapenem against p. aeruginosa clinical isolates was lower than  those of the other carbapenems tested. 3. as main urinary pathogens showed no remarkable increase in resistance to carbapenems, it can be stated that carbapenems retain their position as the drug of first choice for severe infection.

TI  == antibiofilm activity of glmu enzyme inhibitors against catheter-associated uropathogens.
AB  == the colonization of uropathogenic bacteria on urinary catheters resulting in biofilm formation frequently leads to the infection of surrounding tissue and often requires removal of the catheter. infections associated with biofilms are difficult to treat since they may be more than 1,000 times more resistant to antibiotics than their planktonic counterparts. we have developed an antibiofilm  composition comprising an n-acetyl-d-glucosamine-1-phosphate acetyltransferase (glmu) inhibitor and protamine sulfate, a cationic polypeptide. the antibiofilm activity of glmu inhibitors, such as iodoacetamide (ida), n-ethyl maleimide (nem), and nem analogs, including n-phenyl maleimide, n,n'-(1,2-phenylene)dimaleimide (opdm), and n-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide (pyrm), was tested against that of catheter-associated uropathogens. both ida and nem inhibited biofilm formation in escherichia coli. all nem analogs showed antibiofilm activity against clinical isolates of e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, and enterococcus faecalis. the combination of opdm with protamine sulfate (ps) enhanced its antibiofilm activity and reduced its effective concentration to as low as 12.5 microm. in addition, we found that the in vitro inhibitory activity of opdm-plus-ps-coated silicone catheters against p. aeruginosa and s. epidermidis colonization was superior to that of catheters coated with silver hydrogel. confocal scanning laser microscopy further confirmed that the opdm-plus-ps-coated silicone catheters were almost free from bacterial colonization. thus, a broad-spectrum antibiofilm composition comprising a glmu inhibitor and protamine  sulfate shows promise for use in anti-infective coatings for medical devices, including urinary catheters.

TI  == activity of gatifloxacin tested against isolates from pediatric patients: report  from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (north america, 1998-2003).
AB  == the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program has monitored the activity of antimicrobial agents worldwide since 1997. the increasing number of clinical failures with established anti-infectives (penicillins, other beta-lactams, macrolides) among pediatric patients has stressed the importance for alternative  therapeutic options. ciprofloxacin has been recently approved for expanded use as treatment of complicated urinary tract infections in children, and gatifloxacin has been used successfully in clinical trials in selected children with severe or refractory otitis media. we evaluated the activity of gatifloxacin against strains isolated from children < 7 years of age and compared this to the general  patient population (all ages included) using the sentry program database. a total of 59826 north american isolates were collected, of which 4641 were from children (< 7 years old); all isolates were tested using reference broth microdilution methods. in contrast to the general population (gp), gatifloxacin resistance rates were very low among isolates from this younger patient group. gatifloxacin  susceptibility rates were > 84% for all pathogens evaluated in younger patients.  all streptococcus pneumoniae strains from children < 7 years old were susceptible to gatifloxacin, and susceptibility among the enterobacteriaceae species was > 98%. the greatest difference in susceptibility rates between the younger children and the gp was observed among nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli (95.0-100% versus 64.8-83.7%, respectively) and enterococcus faecalis (94.7% versus 58.4%).  gatifloxacin susceptibilities of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. isolates from the pediatric population were > or = 95% (> 97% for ciprofloxacin)  compared to the gp at only 64.8-69.1%. in conclusion, gatifloxacin remains very active against bacterial isolates from children < 7 years, indicative of the limited exposure of this population to fluoroquinolones. continued resistance surveillance will be necessary to monitor the activity of the fluoroquinolone class as they are introduced for specific clinical indications into the pediatric age groups, especially if re-studied against s. pneumoniae (refractory otitis media) and p. aeruginosa (cystic fibrosis associated pneumonia).

AB  == the use of harvested rainwater in domestic hot water systems can result in optimised environmental and economic benefits to urban water cycle management, however, the water quality and health risks of such a scenario have not been adequately investigated. thermal inactivation analyses were carried out on eight  species of non-spore-forming bacteria in a water medium at temperatures relevant  to domestic hot water systems (55-65 degrees c), and susceptibilities to heat stress were compared using d-values. the d-value was defined as the time required to reduce a bacterial population by 90% or 1 log reduction. the results found that both tested strains of enterococcus faecalis were the most heat resistant of the bacteria studied, followed by the pathogens shigella sonnei biotype a and escherichia coli o157:h7, and the non-pathogenic e. coli o3:h6. pseudomonas aeruginosa was found to be less resistant to heat, while salmonella typhimurium,  serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae and aeromonas hydrophila displayed minimal heat resistance capacities. at 65 degrees c, little thermal resistance was demonstrated by any species, with log reductions in concentration occurring within seconds. the results of this study suggested that the temperature range from 55 to 65 degrees c was critical for effective elimination of enteric/pathogenic bacterial components and supported the thesis that hot water systems should operate at a minimum of 60 degrees c.

TI  == [comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2003). ii. background of patients].
AB  == seven hundred and nineteen bacterial strains isolated from 565 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 14 institutions in japan were collected between august 2002 and july 2003. the frequency of bacteria isolation  divided with patient clinical background was compared. the clinical background investigated included sex, age, type of infections, timing of antibiotics administration, and presence or absence of surgery affecting a decrease in defense against infection. the bacterial strains were divided with the age and sex of the patients and the types of infections. in males, the number of patients aged less than 50 years was few and the complicated utis without indwelling catheter was observed most frequently. number of patients aged 20-39 years was greater in female than male. in all of ages except 0-9 and 70-79 years, the ratio of the uncomplicated utis was high, accounting for 44.4-91.7% of all types of infections. in the present time, the bacteria most frequently isolated were escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis also were relatively frequently isolated. e. coli was most frequently isolated from the uncomplicated utis, and p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis were frequently isolated from the complicated utis with indwelling catheter. with respect to the relation  of these results to the age of the patients, in the uncomplicated utis, the isolation frequency of e. coli was the highest in all age groups, accounting for  40% or higher. in the complicated utis without indwelling catheter, the isolation frequency of e. coli decreased with aging of the patients but still was the highest in all age groups. in the complicated utis with indwelling catheter, the  isolation frequency of e. coli was lower than in the uncomplicated utis in all age groups and p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis were more frequently isolated. in comparison of causative bacteria in utis between before and after the administration of antibiotics, p. aeruginosa increased after the administration in any types of utis. in comparison of causative bacteria in utis with or without surgery, e. coli was more frequently isolated in the patients without surgery, while p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis were more frequently isolated in the patients with surgery in any utis.

TI  == comparison of bactericidal activity of six lysozymes at atmospheric pressure and  under high hydrostatic pressure.
AB  == the antibacterial working range of six lysozymes was tested under ambient and high pressure, on a panel of five gram-positive (enterococcus faecalis, bacillus  subtilis, listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus lysodeikticus)  and five gram-negative bacteria (yersinia enterocolitica, shigella flexneri, escherichia coli o157:h7, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium). the lysozymes included two that are commercially available (hen egg white lysozyme or hewl, and mutanolysin from streptomyces globisporus or m1l), and four that were chromatographically purified (bacteriophage lambda lysozyme or lal, bacteriophage t4 lysozyme or t4l, goose egg white lysozyme or gewl, and cauliflower lysozyme or cfl). t4l, lal and gewl were highly pure as evaluated by silver staining of sds-page gels and zymogram analysis while cfl was only partially pure. at ambient pressure each gram-positive test organism displayed a specific pattern of sensitivity to the six lysozymes, but none of the gram-negative bacteria was sensitive to any of the lysozymes. high pressure treatment (130-300 mpa, 25 degrees c, 15 min) sensitised several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria for one or more lysozymes. m. lysodeikticus and p. aeruginosa became sensitive to all lysozymes under high pressure, s. typhimurium remained completely insensitive to all lysozymes, and the other bacteria showed sensitisation to some of the lysozymes. the possible applications of the different lysozymes as biopreservatives, and the possible reasons for the observed differences in bactericidal specificity are discussed.

TI  == bacterial sepsis and chemokines.
AB  == bacterial sepsis causes a high mortality rate when it occurs in patients with compromised host defenses. severely burned patients, typical immunocompromised hosts, are extremely susceptible to infections from various pathogens, and a local wound infection frequently escalates into sepsis. in these patients, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa are familiar pathogens that cause opportunistic infections. also, polymicrobial sepsis frequently occurs in these patients. in this review, therefore, the roles  of chemokines in thermally injured patients infected with these 3 pathogens and polymicrobial sepsis will be discussed. these infections in thermally injured patients may be controlled immunologically, because immunocompetent hosts are resistant to infections with these pathogens. classically activated macrophages (m1mphi) are major effector cells for host innate immune responses against these  infections. however, m1mphi are not generated in thermally injured patients whose alternatively activated macrophages (m2mphi) predominate. m2mphi appear in patients early after severe burn injuries. m2mphi inhibit m1mphi generation through the secretion of ccl17 and il-10. as a modulator of mphi, two different subsets of neutrophils (pmn-i, pmn-ii) are described. pmn-i direct the polarization of resident mphi into m1mphi through the production of ccl3. m2mphi  are induced from resident mphi by ccl2 released from pmn-ii. therefore, as an inhibitor of ccl2, glycyrrhizin protects individuals infected with s. aureus. sepsis stemming from p. aeruginosa wound infection is also influenced by ccl2 released from immature myeloid cells. a large number of immature myeloid cells appear in association with burn injuries. host resistance to s. aureus, e. faecalis, p. aeruginosa or polymicrobial infections may be improved in thermally  injured patients through the induction of m1mphi, elimination of ccl2 and/or depletion of m2mphi induced by ccl2.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of arctium lappa constituents against microorganisms commonly found in endodontic infections.
AB  == this study evaluated in vitro the antimicrobial activity of rough extracts from leaves of arctium lappa and their phases. the following microorganisms, commonly  found in the oral cavity, specifically in endodontic infections, were used: enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis and candida albicans. the agar-diffusion method allowed detection of the hexanic phase as an inhibitor of microbial growth. bioautographic assays identified antimicrobial substances in the extract. the results showed the existence, in the rough hexanic phase and in its fractions, of constituents that  have retention factors (rf) in three distinct zones, thereby suggesting the presence of active constituents with chemical structures of different polarities  that exhibited specificity against the target microorganisms. it may be concluded that the arctium lappa constituents exhibited a great microbial inhibition potential against the tested endodontic pathogens.

TI  == bloodstream infections in organ transplant recipients receiving alemtuzumab: no evidence of occurrence of organisms typically associated with profound t cell depletion.
AB  == background: alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against cd52, a cell surface antigen expressed on b and t lymphocytes, monocytes and nk cells.  its use results in a profound decrease in cd4 positive t lymphocytes. alemtuzumab is used as induction immunosuppression and therapy for rejection in organ transplant recipients in some centers. we followed a cohort of 449 consecutive transplant recipients who received alemtuzumab to determine the occurrence of bloodstream infections, particularly those previously associated with decrease in cd4 positive t lymphocytes. patients and methods: fifteen percent (69/449) patients had at least one episode of bloodstream infection. however, no patient had bacteremia with streptococcus pneumoniae, listeria monocytogenes, non-typhoidal salmonella or mycobacterium avium complex. fungaemia was rare, occurring in 1.5% of patients. the most common organisms isolated from the blood  were staphylococcus aureus (21 episodes), coagulase negative staphylococcus (14 episodes), klebsiella pneumoniae (12 episodes), enterococcus faecium (11 episodes), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 episodes), enterococcus faecalis (9 episodes) and escherichia coli (7 episodes). discussion: we conclude that although alemtuzumab use is associated with profound cd4 positive t lymphocyte depletion, alemtuzumab does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of bloodstream infection with pathogens typically seen in other disorders of cd4 cell depletion, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of silver dressings: an in vitro comparison.
AB  == a range of silver-coated or -impregnated dressings are now commercially available for use but comparative data on their antimicrobial efficacies are limited. the antibacterial activities of five commercially available silver-coated/impregnated dressings were compared against nine common burn-wound pathogens, namely methicillin-sensitive and -resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, proteus vulgaris, acinetobacter baumannii and a multi-drug-efflux-positive acinetobacter  baumannii (bm4454), using a broth culture method. the rapidity and extent of killing of these pathogens under in vitro conditions were evaluated. all five silver-impregnated dressings investigated exerted bactericidal activity, particularly against gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacter species, proteus species and e. coli. the spectrum and rapidity of action, however, ranged widely for different dressings. acticoat and contreet had a broad spectrum of bactericidal activities against both gram-positive and -negative bacteria. contreet was characterized by a very rapid bactericidal action and achieved a reduction of > or =10,000 c.f.u. ml(-1) in the first 30 min for enterobacter cloacae, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumanii. other dressings demonstrated a narrower range of bactericidal activities. understanding the characteristics of these dressings may enable them to be targeted more appropriately according to the specific requirements for use of a particular dressing, as in for prophylaxis in skin grafting or for an infected wound with mrsa.

AB  == propolis ethanolic solutions are the most used propolis products on the market for the treatment of minor ulcers in the mouth, angina, thrush or skin infections. since it is still an unofficial drug in pharmacy, we analyzed the contents of flavonoids in ten commercially available ethanolic solutions of propolis from the croatian market using two complementary colorimetric methods. antimicrobial activities, determined with the diffusion method, against six bacterial species (bacillus subtilis nctc 8236, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, streptococcus pyogenes atcc 12204, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, escherichia  coli atcc 10536, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, and one yeast-like fungus candida albicans atcc 10231 were compared. results of flavonoids analysis suggested that the contents of flavones and flavonols in the products were uniform and ranged from 0.14 to 0.41%, but the content of flavanones varied greatly from 0.43 to 18.78%. total flavonoid content, as the sum of two colorimetric methods, in propolis products was between 0.78 and 18.92%, and most  products had the flavonoids content below 9%. all products with the total flavonoids content above 1% showed antimicrobial activity against the four gram-positive bacterial species tested, and against p. aeruginosa and the yeast-like fungus c. albicans. total flavonoids contents, expressed as the sum of two colorimetric methods, could be useful methods for estimating the flavonoid contents of propolis products. our results indicate that the quality of commercially available propolis products requires verification.

TI  == effect of triclosan on the development of bacterial biofilms by urinary tract pathogens on urinary catheters.
AB  == objectives: to examine (i) the effect of triclosan on the formation of catheter biofilms by urinary tract pathogens and (ii) the diffusion of triclosan through the retention balloons of urinary catheters. methods: models of the catheterized  bladder were infected with eight different urinary tract pathogens and the effect of triclosan on biofilm formation was assessed by determining the numbers of viable cells colonizing the catheters and by scanning electron microscopy. hplc was used to determine the triclosan concentration in urine draining from models that had been fitted with triclosan-inflated silicone catheters. results: when catheters were inflated with triclosan (10 g/l) the formation of catheter biofilm by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis was prevented. the numbers of enterococcus faecalis and providencia stuartii cells colonizing catheters were also significantly reduced (p<0.05). serratia marcescens, morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, were able to produce extensive catheter biofilms in the presence of triclosan. only p. mirabilis produced alkaline urine and encrusted the catheters. concentrations of 0.02-0.16 mg/l of the biocide were detected in urine draining from the model over the 48 h experimental period. conclusions: triclosan diffused through silicone catheter balloons and produced urinary concentrations that prevented catheter encrustation by p. mirabilis and biofilm formation by several  other common pathogens of the catheterized urinary tract. it had little effect on urease-producing p. aeruginosa, s. marcescens or m. morganii but these species did not produce alkaline urine or crystalline biofilms.

TI  == correlation between the genetic diversity of nosocomial pathogens and their survival time in intensive care units.
AB  == bacteria differ in their ability to survive in the hospital environment outside the human host. species remaining viable and infectious have a higher chance of being transmitted, giving them a fitness advantage in hospitals. this differential fitness could be expected to alter the genetic population structure  of bacterial populations in hospitals, and should be reflected by the relative abundance of several successful clones. the objective of this study was to test for a potential correlation between tenacity, i.e. environmental survival, and clonal abundance determined by the genetic diversity in different bacterial species from prospectively collected isolates of intensive care patients. a literature review was performed to identify mean environmental survival times for the most important pathogens in intensive care units (icus): staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, acetinobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter spp., escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. to determine the genetic diversity of the natural population of these species in icus, a prospective 18-month study was conducted in five units with median nosocomial infection rates. all clinical isolates were collected, and highly discriminatory dna fingerprinting techniques were used to identify specific clones. a diversity index for each species was calculated as the number  of distinguishable genotypes in the population divided by size. the correlation between survival times and the diversity indices for the individual pathogens was investigated using non-parametric methods. although 21 studies were identified in the literature, only two were relevant. they showed median survival times between 1.5 days (p. aeruginosa) and 60.0 days (enterococcus faecium). during the prospective icu study, 1264 pathogens were investigated and simple diversity indices between 49.1 (enterococcus faecalis) and 89.8 (e. coli) were found. a correlation between survival times and the diversity indices for the individual pathogens was found (correlation coefficient 0.821, p=0.024). environmental survival may be an important factor contributing to the ecological fitness of some nosocomial pathogens in icus. infection control measures should consider this finding.

AB  == urinary tract infections are one of the most common infectious diseases diagnosed in outpatients as well as in hospitalized patients. recently, urinary tract infections have become more complicated and difficult to treat. therefore, the present study analyzed the occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens isolated at kobe university hospital between 1983 and 2002. this study was performed with three patient groups: urology inpatients, urology outpatients, and inpatients of other departments. during the 20-year study period, we studied 15,925 urine isolates obtained from those patients who were diagnosed with urinary tract infection. overall, enterococcus faecalis was the most frequently isolated pathogen, followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. the frequency of staphylococcus aureus increased over time, corresponding to an increase in the occurrence of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). in addition, the rate of isolation of serratia marcescens also increased  over time, especially among patients with urinary tract catheters. our results demonstrate that the uropathogens isolated at a single institution have shown a trend of increasing resistance to various classes of antimicrobial agents. in addition, serious problems should be anticipated in the treatment of multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa, fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli, and arbekacin-resistant mrsa.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sm-216601, a new broad-spectrum  parenteral carbapenem.
AB  == sm-216601 is a novel parenteral 1beta-methylcarbapenem. in agar dilution susceptibility testing, the mic of sm-216601 for 90% of the methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) strains tested (mic(90)) was 2 microg/ml, which was  comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid. sm-216601 was also very potent against enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant strains (mic(90) = 8 microg/ml). sm-216601 exhibited potent activity against penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, moraxella  catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, with mic(90)s of less than 0.5 microg/ml, and intermediate activity against citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa. the therapeutic efficacy of sm-216601 against experimentally induced  infections in mice caused by s. aureus, e. faecium, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa reflected its in vitro activity and plasma level. thus, sm-216601 is a promising  candidate for nosocomial bacterial infections caused by a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens.

TI  == analysis of antibiotic susceptibility and resistance of leg ulcer bacterial flora in patients hospitalized at dermatology department, poznan university hospital.
AB  == effective treatment of frequently infected, poorly healing wounds such as leg ulcers due to chronic venous insufficiency poses a major clinical problem. antibiotic resistance in dermatology patients, especially those with non-healing  leg ulcers, is a widespread phenomenon. various antibiotics, mainly broad-spectrum agents, are frequently and sometimes inappropriately prescribed, which often leads to the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria strains. the  aim of this study was to analyze antibiotic susceptibility and resistance of bacterial isolates cultured from leg ulcers. wound swabs were obtained from patients admitted to dermatology department, poznan university of medical sciences, during the 1998-2002 period. bacteriologic diagnosis of 175 wound swabs was performed in compliance with compulsory laboratory methods. the analysis yielded 173 positive results, predominated by staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas  aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. bacterial isolates were evaluated for resistance to commonly used antibiotics, taking into consideration the presence of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus strains. antibiotic resistance profiles were compared between the years 1998 and 2002, with detailed account of clinical characteristics and history of leg ulcers disease. the study pointed to an increasing tendency of antibiotic resistance in the study group of patients.

TI  == is the use o f gunnera perpensa extracts in endometritis related to antibacterial activity?
AB  == rhizome extracts of gunnera perpensa are used in traditional remedies in south africa to treat endometritis both in humans and animals. an investigation was undertaken to determine whether this plant possesses antibacterial activity, which may explain its efficacy. gunnera perpensa rhizome extracts were prepared serially with solvents of increasing polarity and tested for antibacterial activity. test bacteria included the gram-positive enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus and the gram-negative escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. a moderate to weak level of antibacterial activity in most of the extracts resulted, with the best minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) value of  2.61 mg ml(-1) shown by the acetone extract against s. aureus. the extracts were  also submitted to the brine shrimp assay to detect possible toxic or pharmacological effects. all the extracts were lethal to the brine shrimp larvae  at a concentration of 5 mg ml(-1). the acetone extract was extremely toxic at 1 mg ml(-1), with some toxicity evident at 0.1 mg ml(-1). the remainder of the extracts generally displayed little activity at concentrations lower than 5 mg ml(-1). in summary, the results indicate that although the extracts demonstrated  a level of pharmacological activity, the relatively weak antibacterial activity is unlikely to justify the use of g. perpensa rhizomes in the traditional treatment of endometritis. rather, the slightly antibacterial nature of the rhizomes may contribute to an additive effect, along with their known uterotonic  activity, to the overall efficacy of the preparation.

TI  == rationale for using peltophorum africanum (fabaceae) extracts in veterinary medicine.
AB  == peltophorum africanum (fabaceae) is a deciduous tree widespread in southern africa. the plant has many ethnomedical and ethnoveterinary uses. root and bark decoctions are used to treat diarrhoea, dysentery, sore throat, wounds, back and  joint pains, hiv-aids, venereal diseases and infertility. pastoralists and rural  farmers use the root and bark extracts to treat diarrhoea, dysentery, infertility, and to promote well-being and resistance to diseases in cattle. to evaluate these ethnobotanical leads, dried leaves, stem bark and root bark were extracted with ethanol, acetone, dichloromethane and hexane. polyphenols in the extract were determined by the folin-ciocalteu method with gallic acid as standard. qualitative antioxidant activity was screened by spraying thin layer chromatograms (tlc) of the extracts with 0.2% 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl (dpph), and quantified with trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (teac) assay.  minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and total antibacterial activity (taa) were determined by serial microplate dilution for staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, with gentamicin as standard and tetrazolium violet as growth indicator. acetone and ethanol extracted the largest quantity of material. polyphenols concentration was 49.2% in acetone extract of the root and 3.8% in dichloromethane extract of the leaf. antioxidant activity of at least 5 antioxidant compounds as measured by teac ranged from 1.34 (ethanol extract of the root) to 0.01 (hexane extract of the leaf). the total antibacterial activity (volume to which active compounds present in 1 g plant material can be diluted and still inhibit bacterial growth)  was 1263 ml/g for ethanol extract of the root against s. aureus, and 800 ml/g for acetone extract of the root against p. aeruginosa. there was substantial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, with mic values of 0.08 mg/ml for s. aureus and 0.16 mg/ml for p. aeruginosa. there is therefore a rationale for the traditional use of root and bark of p. africanum in treating bacterial infection related diseases.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline against 6792 gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates from the global tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test program, 2004).
AB  == tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antibiotic, has shown promising in vitro activity against many common pathogens, including multidrug-resistant strains. to determine the activity of tigecycline against a broad range of pathogens from diverse populations and geographic areas, the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test program) commenced in 2003. this study evaluated the activity of tigecycline and commonly used antimicrobials against 6792 clinical isolates from 40 study centers in 11 countries. tigecycline was the most active agent tested against gram-positive facultative species including multidrug-resistant strains. mic90 results (microg/ml) for tigecycline against enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.12, 0.12, 0.25, and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. tigecycline was active against enterobacteriaceae with an mic90 of 1 microg/ml. haemophilus influenzae was very susceptible to tigecycline with an mic90 of only 0.25 microg/ml. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the  least susceptible organism tested against tigecycline. tigecycline appears to be  a promising new glycylcycline agent for the treatment of many types of pathogens  with varying resistance phenotypes.

TI  == solid- and vapor-phase antimicrobial activities of six essential oils: susceptibility of selected foodborne bacterial and fungal strains.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of essential oils (eos) of cinnamon (cinnamon zeylanicum), clove (syzygium aromaticum), basil (ocimum basillicum), rosemary (rosmarinus officinalis), dill (anethum graveolens), and ginger (zingiber officinalis) was evaluated over a range of concentrations in two types of contact tests (solid and vapor diffusion). the eos were tested against an array of four gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, and listeria monocytogenes), four gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella choleraesuis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three fungi (a yeast, candida albicans, and two molds, penicillium islandicum and aspergillus flavus). the rationale for this work was to test the possibility of creating a protective atmosphere by using natural compounds that could extend the shelf life of packaged foodstuffs while minimizing organoleptic alterations. in the solid diffusion tests, cinnamon and clove gave the strongest (and very similar) inhibition, followed by basil and rosemary, with dill and ginger giving the weakest inhibition. the fungi were the  most sensitive microorganisms, followed by the gram-positive bacterial strains. the gram-negative strain p. aeruginosa was the least inhibited. the composition of the atmosphere generated by the eos, and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), were determined using a disk volatilization method, in which no inhibition from rosemary or basil was observed. cinnamon and clove, once again, gave similar results for every microorganism. as a general rule, mic (fungi) << mic (bacteria) with no clear differences between gram-positive or -negative strains except for p. aeruginosa, which was not inhibited by any of the eos in the vapor phase. the atmosphere generated from the eos was analyzed by means of solid-phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry. differences among the volatiles in the eos, which may be responsible for the differences in their antimicrobial performances, were found.

TI  == domain 5 of high molecular weight kininogen is antibacterial.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides are important effectors of the innate immune system. these peptides belong to a multifunctional group of molecules that apart from their antibacterial activities also interact with mammalian cells and glycosaminoglycans and control chemotaxis, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. here we demonstrate a novel antimicrobial activity of the heparin-binding and cell-binding domain 5 of high molecular weight kininogen. antimicrobial epitopes  of domain 5 were characterized by analysis of overlapping peptides. a peptide, hkh20 (his(479)-his(498)), efficiently killed the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa and the gram-positive enterococcus faecalis. fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy demonstrated that hkh20 binds to and induces breaks in bacterial membranes. furthermore, no discernible hemolysis or membrane-permeabilizing effects on eukaryotic cells were noted. proteolytic degradation of high molecular weight kininogen by neutrophil-derived  proteases as well as the metalloproteinase elastase from p. aeruginosa yielded fragments comprising hkh20 epitopes, indicating that kininogen-derived antibacterial peptides are released during proteolysis.

AB  == bowel colonization with resistant bacteria can develop in patients receiving broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy. we compared the impact of two antimicrobial regimens often used to treat intraabdominal infections on susceptibility patterns of bowel flora at the end of therapy. in a double-blind clinical trial, adults with complicated intraabdominal infection requiring surgery were randomized to receive piperacillin-tazobactam (3.375 g every 6 h) or ertapenem (1 g once a day) for 4 to 14 days. rectal swabs were obtained at baseline and at the end of study  therapy to determine the acquisition rates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to the study drug, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli or klebsiella species, pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to imipenem or piperacillin-tazobactam, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis or enterococcus faecium. treated patients were assessable for the acquisition of resistant bacteria if appropriate specimens were obtained at both time points. enterobacteriaceae resistant to the treatment received were acquired during study therapy by 8/122 assessable piperacillin-tazobactam recipients (6.6%) compared to 0/122 assessable ertapenem recipients (p = 0.007). neither esbl-producing e. coli or klebsiella species nor p. aeruginosa resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam was  isolated from patients in either treatment group. imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa was acquired by two of the ertapenem recipients (1.6%) versus zero of  the piperacillin-tazobactam recipients (p = 0.50). vancomycin-resistant enterococci were acquired during therapy by 8/125 assessable ertapenem recipients (6.4%) versus 2/123 assessable piperacillin-tazobactam recipients (1.6%; p = 0.10). in this study, the acquisition of resistant enterobacteriaceae occurred significantly more often in patients treated with piperacillin-tazobactam than in those treated with ertapenem.

AB  == nontypeable haemophilus influenzae (nthi) is an obligate parasite of the oropharynx of humans, in whom it commonly causes mucosal infections such as otitis media, sinusitis, and bronchitis. we used a subtractive phage display approach to affinity select for peptides binding to the cell surface of a novel invasive nthi strain r2866 (also called int1). over half of the selected phage peptides tested were bactericidal toward r2866 in a dose-dependent manner. five of the clones encoded the same peptide sequence (kqrtsirategclps; clone hi3/17),  while the remaining four clones encoded unique peptides. all of the bactericidal  phage peptides but one were cationic and had similar physical-chemical properties. clone hi3/17 possessed a similar level of activity toward a panel of  clinical nthi isolates and h. influenzae type b strains but lacked bactericidal activity toward gram-positive (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus) and  gram-negative (proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella enterica) bacteria. these data indicate that peptides binding to bacterial surface structures isolated by phage display may prove of value in developing new antibiotics.

AB  == bloodstream infection (bsi) is a significant problem after cord blood transplantation (cbt). however, little information has been reported on bsi after reduced-intensity cbt (ri-cbt). we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 102 patients. the median age of the patients was 55 years (range, 17-79 years). preparative regimens comprised fludarabine 125 to 150 mg/m 2 , melphalan  80 to 140 mg/m 2 , or busulfan 8 mg/kg and total body irradiation 2 to 8 gy. prophylaxis against graft-versus-host disease comprised cyclosporin or tacrolimus. bsi developed within 100 days of ri-cbt in 32 patients. the cumulative incidence of bsi was 25% at day 30 and 32% at day 100. the median onset was day 15 (range, 1-98 days). causative organisms included pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 12), staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 11), staphylococcus aureus (n = 6), enterococcus faecium (n = 4), enterococcus faecalis (n = 4), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 4), and others (n = 7). of the 32 patients with bsi, 25 (84%) died within 100 days after ri-cbt. bsi was the direct cause of death in 8 patients (25%). univariate analysis failed to identify any significant risk factors. bsi clearly represents a significant and fatal complication after ri-cbt. further studies are warranted to determine clinical characteristics, identify patients at high risk of bsi, and establish therapeutic strategies.

TI  == perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis in urology: a multi-center prospective study.
AB  == since there are few published reports regarding the impact of urologic surgery on perioperative infections, an epidemiologic analysis was performed on data from 1,156 open or laparoscopic operations in urology collected by the 21 hospitals participating in this study between september 2002 and august 2003. prophylactic  antibiotics were administered intravenously according to our protocol designed on the basis of the invasiveness and contamination levels. the surgical site infection (ssi) rates following clean, clean-contaminated and contaminated surgery were 1.2%. 5.8% and 23.4%, respectively, while the remote infection (ri)  rates were 3.5%. 7.1% and 35.9%, respectively. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was most frequently isolated from ssis as well as ris, whereas enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa were more frequently discovered in ris than in ssis. several risk factors for ssi and/or ri, such as older age, high asa score, obesity, diabetes, preoperative chemotherapy, long operation time and much blood loss, were identified by univariate analysis.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of phrygilanthus acutifolius.
AB  == ethanol extract of flowers of phrygilanthus acutifolius (ruiz & pav.) eichler (loranthaceae) inhibited the growth of both gram (+) bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus saprophyticus and enterococcus faecalis) and gram (-) bacteria (serratia marcescens, acinetobacter sp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa). this extract was bactericidal against staphylococcus aureus and bacteriostatic against pseudomonas aeruginosa. morphological evidence suggests that the extract  causes the swelling of the bacterial body of staphylococcus aureus, the disintegration of the cell surface and the cell death. bactericidal activity was  optimal at ph 7.5 and was not affected by different ionic strengths. the presence of mg2+ in the culture medium of phrygilanthus acutifolius diminished the sensitivity of pseudomonas aeruginosa strain against the extract. test results would tend to corroborate the folk belief that the flowers of this plant are efficacious against respiratory infections and would justify its further investigation.

TI  == chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of four different anatolian propolis samples.
AB  == propolis means a gum that is gathered by bees from various plants. it is known for its biological properties, having antibacterial, antifungal and healing properties. the aims of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of four different anatolian propolis samples on different groups of microorganisms including some oral pathogens and comparison between their chemical compositions. ethanol extracts of propolis (eep) were prepared from four different anatolian propolis samples and examined whether eep inhibit the growth of the test microorganisms or not. for the antimicrobial activity assays, minimum inhibitory  concentrations (mic) were determined by using macrodilution method. the mic values of the most effective propolis (tb) were 2 microg/ml for streptococcus sobrinus and enterococcus faecalis, 4 microg/ml for micrococcus luteus, candida albicans and c. krusei, 8 microg/ml for streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterobacter aerogenes, 16 microg/ml for escherichia coli and c. tropicalis and 32 microg/ml for salmonella typhimurium and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the chemical compositions of eep's were determined by high-temperature high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. the main compounds of four anatolian propolis samples were flavonoids such as pinocembrin, pinostropin, isalpinin, pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine and chrysin. although propolis samples were collected from different regions of anatolia all showed significant antimicrobial activity against the gram positive bacteria and yeasts. propolis can prevent dental caries since it demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms such as streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus and c. albicans, which involves in oral diseases.

AB  == in 2003, 826 uropathogenic strains were obtained from the urine of our patients.  we assessed their activities to antibacterial agents based on the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) breakpoints recommended by the national committee  for clinical standards (nccls). methicillin-resistant strains accounted for about 70% of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. the most common gram-positive species was enterococcus faecalis (15.6%). enterococcus faecium was the most resistant of the enterococcal species, and the rate of susceptibility to beta-lactams (bls), fluoroquinolones (fqs), and tetracyclines (tcs) was 0%, 6%, and less than 18%, respectively. escherichia coli accounted for over 50% of the gram-negative bacilli. the proportion of fq-resistant or intermediate strains was over 20%, and four of these strains (1.1%) were suspected of producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl). all the esbl-producing strains (esbls) possess resistance to fqs. over 95% of klebsiella pneumoniae was susceptible to all agents. the distribution of antimicrobial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa indicated a decrease in the number of multidrug-resistant strains and  an increase in strains susceptible to all agents. some differences existed in the resistance to antibacterial agents among proteus species. no esbl-producing or multidrug-resistant strain was isolated from serratia marcescens. this survey suggests that serious clinical problems will result from the increasing number of enterococcal species with multidrug resistance in gram-positive cocci, and isolates of esbl-producing or fqs-resistant strains in gram-negative bacilli.

TI  == plant models for animal pathogenesis.
AB  == several bacteria that are pathogenic to animals also infect plants. mechanistic studies have proven that some human/animal pathogenic bacteria employ a similar subset of virulence determinants to elicit disease in animals, invertebrates and  plants. therefore, the results of plant infection studies are relevant to animal  pathogenesis. this discovery has resulted in the development of convenient, cost-effective, and reliable plant infection models to study the molecular basis  of infection by animal pathogens. plant infection models provide a number of advantages in the study of animal pathogenesis. using a plant model, mutations in animal pathogenic bacteria can easily be screened for putative virulence factors, a process which if done using existing animal infection models would be time-consuming and tedious. high-throughput screening of plants also provides the potential for unravelling the mechanisms by which plants resist animal pathogenic bacteria, and provides a means to discover novel therapeutic agents such as antibiotics and anti-infective compounds. in this review, we describe the developing technique of using plants as a model system to study pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus pathogenesis, and discuss ways to use this new technology against disease warfare and other types of bioterrorism.

TI  == in vitro exposure of bacteria to antimicrobial impregnated-central venous catheters does not directly lead to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.
AB  == objective: use of central venous catheters (cvcs) impregnated with minocycline and rifampin reduces the density of bacterial growth on catheters and decreases the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections. questions have been raised over the possibility that the use of these catheters will lead to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms. in this study, we sought to determine if in vitro exposure of four test organisms to catheter segments impregnated with minocycline and rifampin would lead to the development of antibiotic resistance. methods: catheter segments (1.0 cm) were placed on the surface of agar plates previously inoculated with bacterial suspensions, such that a subconfluent lawn of colony growth would be apparent after 24 h incubation at 35 degrees c in air. test organisms included american type culture collection  strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. zones of inhibition of colony growth surrounding catheters were measured at 24-h intervals up to 7 days  (two catheter segments per test). colonies on agar surfaces located at varying distances from catheter segments were examined for minocycline and rifampin resistance following various periods of exposure (six catheter segments per test). in addition, selected colonies were subsequently exposed to minocycline and rifampin in broth and examined for selection of minocycline and rifampin resistance (> 28 colonies per selection test). results: inhibitory zones of 14 to 47 mm were observed with s aureus, s epidermidis, e faecalis, and e coli. growth  of p aeruginosa was not inhibited by cvc segments. testing of colonies of the first four organisms at various distances from cvc segments after varying periods of exposure revealed only a single instance of the emergence of resistance (eg, s aureus vs rifampin). recovery of resistant clones was enhanced with minocycline and rifampin broth selection; however, a direct link between cvc exposure and the emergence of resistance was not established. conclusions: our in vitro data suggest that the exposure of gram-positive cocci to either rifampin or minocycline can lead to the development of resistance. however, exposure of bacteria to these antibiotics in combination does not directly lead to resistance. clinical investigations will be required to determine the true risk and implications of the development of resistance.

AB  == the bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa) isolated from patients diagnosed as urinary tract infections (utis) in 13 institutions in japan were supplied between august 2002 and july 2003. the susceptibilities of these bacteria to various antimicrobial agents were examined. the bacteria were divided into 2 groups consisting of uncomplicated utis and complicated utis (with and without indwelling catheter) based on their isolation origins. the results were compared  with those obtained between 1993 and 2001. the drug sensitivity of s. aureus in this year was similar to those in up to the previous year and s. aureus showed the best susceptibility to vancomycin. the drug sensitivity of e. faecalis in this year also was similar to those in up to the previous year. the drug sensitivity of e. coli in this year was generally good except penicillins and was similar to those in up to the previous year. among cephems, cefozopran (czop) and cefpirome (cpr) showed the highest potency (mic90: < or = 0.125 microg/ml). an antibacterial activity of cefotiam (ctm) was similar to it in 10 years ago and was fine (mic90: < or = 1 microg/ml). the sensitivity of e. coli to carbapenems and carumonam (crmn) also was good like to czop. however, the sensitivity of the  complicated utis group to quinolones decreased after 2000 and was suggested to develop the resistance to the drug. the drug sensitivity of klebsiella spp. in this year also was similar to those in up to the previous year. the bacteria showed good susceptibility (mic: < or = 0.125 microg/ml) to cefmenoxime (cmx), cpr, cefixime (cfix), flomoxef (fmox), and czop among cephems. the drug sensitivity of p. aeruginosa was generally low. most of the bacteria were little  sensitive to cephems except czop and ceftazidime (caz). the sensitive bacteria to czop and ceftazidime (caz) were observed to be 26.8% (15/56 strains) and 39.3% (22/56 strains) in complicated utis group, respectively. the sensitivity profile  of p. aeruginosa to the other tested drugs was not much different from that in up to the previous year. however, the sensitivity of the bacteria to carbapenems tended to decrease after 2000, and the low sensitive strains (mic: > or = 256 microg/ml) were detected at 22.2% (2/9 strains) in the uncomplicated utis group and 3.6% (2/56 strains) in the complicated utis group.

TI  == screening of lactic-acid bacteria from south african barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  == strains of lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain st11br), l. pentosus  (strain st151br), l. plantarum (strain st13br), and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain st34br) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the western, northern and eastern provinces of south africa. the peptides (bacst11br, bacst151br, bacst13br and bacst34br) lost their  activity after treatment with proteinase k, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. the peptides inhibited the growth of lactobacillus casei, l. sakei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis, but not enterobacter cloacae, lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, l. plantarum, l. salivarius, listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, s. agalactiae, s. caprinus and s. pneumoniae. peptides bacst11br and bacst13br differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the e. coli strains. peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at ph 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees c. when autoclaved (121 degrees c, 20 min), only bacst13br lost its activity. the bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees c,  but not at 37 degrees c.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin compared with other quinolones against clinical isolates from cancer patients.
AB  == owing to the predominance of gram-positive pathogens in neutropenic cancer patients, newer generation quinolones with an expanded gram-positive spectrum and enhanced potency, may have a role to play for prophylaxis and/or empiric therapy  in such patients. the in vitro activity of gatifloxacin was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and trovafloxacin against 848 recent clinical isolates from cancer patients. against gram-positive organisms, gatifloxacin was  the most active agent tested inhibiting all aerococcus, listeria monocytogens, micrococcus, stomatococcus mucilaginous, bacillus, and rhodococcus equi strains at < or =2 mg/l, its designated susceptibility breakpoint. it was also very active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and streptococcus spp. (including penicillin nonsusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans streptococci). it had moderate activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococcus faecalis, inhibiting 68-80% of these strains at <  or =2 mg/l. gatifloxacin also had good activity against the enterobacteriaceae (although ciprofloxacin was more potent) inhibiting >95% of isolates at < or =1 mg/l. nonfermentative gram-negative organisms were less susceptible to all 4 agents. gatifloxacin was very active against acinetobacter lwoffi (mic100 0.12 mg/l) and had moderate activity against acinetobacter baumanii, chryseobacterium  spp., stenotrophomonas maltophilia, pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pseudomonas  species. alcaligenes xylosoxidans strains were relatively resistant to all 4 agents.

TI  == [surveillance of antimicrobial resistance: vira study 2004].
AB  == introduction: the objective of the study was to know the current situation of the antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of the main multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the vira study carried out in 2001.  methods: the 40 participating hospitals sent a total of 1,425 microorganisms isolated in february 2004, distributed as follows: penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (139), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (289), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (158), ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecium (89) and enterococcus faecalis (2), ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae (85), ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli (346), pseudomonas aeruginosa (187), and acinetobacter baumannii (130). the hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. sensitivity was determined by the broth microdilution method. results: the number of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci fell significantly (p < 0.0001) compared with the previous study (from 59.8% to 30.2%). global methicillin-resistance in s. aureus was 31.2%, which represents a significant increase (p < 0.001) compared with the year 2001 (24.8%). 11.3% of the e. coli strains were extended-spectrum beta -lactamase-producers and came from 24 hospitals. one p. aeruginosa isolate gave a positive result in the e-test mbl assay, suggesting the presence of metallo-beta -lactamases. the strains of imipenem-resistant a. baumannii presented cross-resistance with several antibiotics. conclusion: these results show how the multi-resistant bacteria included in the study represent a growing problem in our hospitals. this emphasizes the importance of resistance surveillance systems and the correct use  of antimicrobial agents.

TI  == usnic acid, a natural antimicrobial agent able to inhibit bacterial biofilm formation on polymer surfaces.
AB  == in modern medicine, artificial devices are used for repair or replacement of damaged parts of the body, delivery of drugs, and monitoring the status of critically ill patients. however, artificial surfaces are often susceptible to colonization by bacteria and fungi. once microorganisms have adhered to the surface, they can form biofilms, resulting in highly resistant local or systemic  infections. at this time, the evidence suggests that (+)-usnic acid, a secondary  lichen metabolite, possesses antimicrobial activity against a number of planktonic gram-positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus  faecalis, and enterococcus faecium. since lichens are surface-attached communities that produce antibiotics, including usnic acid, to protect themselves from colonization by other bacteria, we hypothesized that the mode of action of usnic acid may be utilized in the control of medical biofilms. we loaded (+)-usnic acid into modified polyurethane and quantitatively assessed the capacity of (+)-usnic acid to control biofilm formation by either s. aureus or pseudomonas aeruginosa under laminar flow conditions by using image analysis. (+)-usnic acid-loaded polymers did not inhibit the initial attachment of s. aureus cells, but killing the attached cells resulted in the inhibition of biofilm. interestingly, although p. aeruginosa biofilms did form on the surface of (+)-usnic acid-loaded polymer, the morphology of the biofilm was altered, possibly indicating that (+)-usnic acid interfered with signaling pathways.

TI  == optimization of bacteriocin production by lactobacillus plantarum st13br, a strain isolated from barley beer.
AB  == the cell-free supernatant containing bacteriocin st13br, produced by lactobacillus plantarum st13br, inhibits the growth of l. casei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli. based on tricine-sds-page, bacteriocin st13br is 10 kda in size. complete inactivation or significant reduction in bacteriocin activity was observed after  treatment with proteinase k, trypsin and pronase, but not with catalase or alpha-amylase. low bacteriocin activity (200 au/ml) was recorded in bhi medium, m17 broth, 10% (w/v) soy milk, and 2% and 10% (w/v) molasses, despite good growth. maximal bacteriocin activity (6,400 au/ml) was recorded after 23 h in mrs broth, but only at 30 degrees c. tween 80 in mrs broth increased bacteriocin production by more than 50%. meat extract or yeast extract as sole nitrogen source, or a combination of the two (1 : 1) in mrs broth, stimulated bacteriocin  production (6,400 au/ml). only 50% activity (3,200 au/ml) was recorded with tryptone as sole nitrogen source, whereas a combination of tryptone, meat extract and yeast extract yielded 6,400 au/ml. bacteriocin production was not stimulated  by the addition of glucose at 2.0% w/v (3,200 au/ml), nor 2% (w/v) fructose, sucrose, lactose or mannose, respectively (800 au/ml). activity levels less than  200 au/ml were recorded in the presence of 0.05% to 0.5% (w/v) maltose. maximal bacteriocin production (6,400 au/ml) was recorded in the presence of 2% (w/v) maltose. maltose at 4.0% (w/v) led to a 50% reduction of bacteriocin activity. the presence of 1.0% (w/v) and higher kh(2)po(4), or glycerol at 0.2% (w/v) suppressed bacteriocin production.

TI  == the art of serendipity: killing of caenorhabditis elegans by human pathogens as a model of bacterial and fungal pathogenesis.
AB  == the nematode worm, caenorhabditis elegans, has been used to develop a facile model system of host-pathogen interactions to identify basic evolutionarily conserved pathways associated with microbial pathogenesis. the model involves the killing of caenorhabditis elegans by a variety of human pathogens. several virulence-related genes in a variety of pathogens previously shown to be involved in mammalian infection have also been shown to play a role in caenorhabditis elegans killing. screening of large numbers of microbial mutants for attenuation  in a mammalian model would require thousands of mice, rats or rabbits. in contrast, the caenorhabditis elegans model allows rapid identification of mutants in microbial genes associated with pathogenesis and then these phenotypes can be  confirmed in a relevant mammalian model.

TI  == detection of low levels of listeria monocytogenes cells by using a fiber-optic immunosensor.
AB  == biosensor technology has a great potential to meet the need for sensitive and nearly real-time microbial detection from foods. an antibody-based fiber-optic biosensor to detect low levels of listeria monocytogenes cells following an enrichment step was developed. the principle of the sensor is a sandwich immunoassay where a rabbit polyclonal antibody was first immobilized on polystyrene fiber waveguides through a biotin-streptavidin reaction to capture listeria cells on the fiber. capture of cells on the fibers was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. a cyanine 5-labeled murine monoclonal antibody, c11e9, was used to generate a specific fluorescent signal, which was acquired by  launching a 635-nm laser light from an analyte 2000 and collected by a photodetector at 670 to 710 nm. this immunosensor was specific for l. monocytogenes and showed a significantly higher signal strength than for other listeria species or other microorganisms, including escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella enterica, lactobacillus plantarum, carnobacterium gallinarum, hafnia alvei, corynebacterium glutamicum, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens, in pure or in mixed-culture setup. fiber-optic results could be obtained within 2.5 h of sampling. the sensitivity threshold was about 4.3 x 10(3) cfu/ml for a pure culture of l. monocytogenes grown at 37 degrees c. when l. monocytogenes was mixed with lactic acid bacteria or grown at 10 degrees c with 3.5% nacl, the detection threshold was 4.1 x 10(4) or 2.8 x 10(7) cfu/ml, respectively. in less  than 24 h, this method could detect l. monocytogenes in hot dog or bologna naturally contaminated or artificially inoculated with 10 to 1,000 cfu/g after enrichment in buffered listeria enrichment broth.

TI  == newer carbapenems for urinary tract infections.
AB  == four carbapenems have been available clinically in japan. these are imipenem/cilastatin (imip/cs) and panipenem/ betamipron (pani/bp) of the older compounds and newer carbapenems such as biapem (biap) and meropenem (mero). the latter compounds are relatively stable to dehydropeptidase-1 (dhp-1) and have been reported to have higher antimicrobial activities compared to the earlier carbapenems. the antimicrobial activity of these four carbapenems against fresh urinary isolates showed high activities against enterobacteriacae such as serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and escherichia coli containing the class c-beta-lactamase- and extended spectrum beta-lactamase  (esbl)-producing strains compared to piperacillin (pipc) and ceftazidime (ctaz).  against pseudomonas aeruginosa, the carbapenems, with the exception of panipenem  showed strong antimicrobial activities compared to pipc and ctaz. high activities were also seen against enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, but methicillin-resistant strains were not affected.  the first generation carbapenems showed better activity against e. faecalis than  newer carbapenems. all four carbapenems were similar in clinical effectiveness in double blind trials for complicated urinary tract infections (utis). however, pani/bp is less effective in utis caused by p. aeruginosa than imip/cs. mero showed better eradication rate of p. aeruginosa than imip/cs. retrospective analysis of treated cases using carbapenems showed a rapid defervescence in the treatment of febrile complicated utis, which were mainly caused by mixed infection of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, especially those involving p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis.

TI  == bacterial resistance to antimicrobials in urinary isolates.
AB  == escherichia coli accounted for about 80% of organisms in uncomplicated urinary tract infections (utis), followed by staphylococcus spp. especially staphylococcus saprophyticus, and proteus mirabilis. against e. coli isolates from patients with uncomplicated uti, faropenem was the most effective. up to 1999, fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates were not observed in patients with uncomplicated uti, but in 2001 fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli isolates emerged and accounted for about 8%. various types of organisms were isolated in patients  with complicated uti. enterococcus faecalis, e. coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa  were the three most frequent organisms isolated. these three organisms accounted  for 44.6%. amongst oral agents, faropenem showed the lowest rate of resistance against e. coli followed by cephems. the rates of highly fluoroquinolone-resistant and cefpodoxime-resistant e. coli isolates increased rapidly from 1998 to 2001. fluoroquinolone-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates accounted for about 40% in 2001. against this species, amikacin was the most effective antimicrobials among all agents tested. about 17% of pseudomonas were resistant to carbapenem. eight milligram per litre of ampicillin inhibited all e. faecalis isolates; about 60% of enterococcus faecium were resistant to ampicillin. the rates of levofloxacin-resistant isolates of e. faecalis and e. faecium were 38 and 97% respectively. utis caused by vancomycin resistant enterococci (vre) are rare in japan.

TI  == conservative medical therapy of prosthetic joint infections: retrospective analysis of an 8-year experience.
AB  == successful treatment of prosthetic joint infections often requires multiple surgical interventions and prolonged antimicrobial therapy. however, in certain situations, a surgical approach may not be in the best interest of the patient. a conservative approach was used to treat 34 patients with prosthetic joint infection between 1995 and 2003. diagnosis of infection was based on clinical-microbiological evidence, confirmed by (99)tc-labelled leukocyte scintigraphy, and involved 12 staphylococcus aureus infections, nine staphylococcus epidermidis infections, two enterococcus faecalis infections, two  mixed infections (s. aureus plus pseudomonas aeruginosa; s. epidermidis plus e. faecalis), with the infecting pathogen being unidentified for nine patients. most infections were treated initially with intravenous or intramuscular teicoplanin +/- ciprofloxacin or rifampicin, followed by oral ciprofloxacin or minocycline plus rifampicin. the mean duration of antimicrobial therapy was 41.2 weeks. overall, only three patients did not respond to therapy, and infection was controlled in the remaining 31 patients. among these, no relapse was observed in  17 patients during follow-up for 9-57 months; improvement with early (within 6 months of antibiotic discontinuation) or late relapse was observed in seven and three patients, respectively; two patients improved clinically, but continued to  receive antibiotic therapy; and two patients whose condition improved initially were lost after a 6-month follow-up following discontinuation of antibiotics. no  patient complained of side effects requiring discontinuation of antibiotic therapy. the study confirmed that suppression of infection, with salvage of the infected device in an acceptably functional state, can be achieved in selected cases.

TI  == biofuel cells select for microbial consortia that self-mediate electron transfer.
AB  == microbial fuel cells hold great promise as a sustainable biotechnological solution to future energy needs. current efforts to improve the efficiency of such fuel cells are limited by the lack of knowledge about the microbial ecology  of these systems. the purposes of this study were (i) to elucidate whether a bacterial community, either suspended or attached to an electrode, can evolve in  a microbial fuel cell to bring about higher power output, and (ii) to identify species responsible for the electricity generation. enrichment by repeated transfer of a bacterial consortium harvested from the anode compartment of a biofuel cell in which glucose was used increased the output from an initial level of 0.6 w m(-2) of electrode surface to a maximal level of 4.31 w m(-2) (664 mv, 30.9 ma) when plain graphite electrodes were used. this result was obtained with  an average loading rate of 1 g of glucose liter(-1) day(-1) and corresponded to 81% efficiency for electron transfer from glucose to electricity. cyclic voltammetry indicated that the enhanced microbial consortium had either membrane-bound or excreted redox components that were not initially detected in the community. dominant species of the enhanced culture were identified by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and culturing. the community consisted mainly of facultative anaerobic bacteria, such as alcaligenes faecalis and enterococcus gallinarum, which are capable of hydrogen production. pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pseudomonas species were also isolated. for several isolates, electrochemical activity was mainly due to excreted redox mediators, and one of these mediators, pyocyanin produced by p. aeruginosa, could be characterized. overall, the enrichment procedure, irrespective of whether only attached or suspended bacteria were examined, selected for organisms capable of mediating the electron transfer either by direct bacterial transfer or by excretion of redox components.

TI  == urinary concentrations and bactericidal activities of newer fluoroquinolones in healthy volunteers.
AB  == eleven healthy male subjects participated in a crossover study to compare the urine concentrations and bactericidal activities of newer fluoroquinolones against common uropathogens. each volunteer received a single oral dose of gatifloxacin (400 mg), levofloxacin (250 mg), moxifloxacin (400 mg) and trovafloxacin (200 mg), and a urine sample was obtained at 2, 6, 12 and 24 h after the dose. urine concentrations were highest with gatifloxacin and levofloxacin and lowest with trovafloxacin. each drug concentration was studied against a levofloxacin susceptible and moderately-susceptible strain of escherichia coli (minimal inhibitory concentration, mics: 0.125 and 4 mg/l), k. pneumoniae (mics: 0.125 and 4 mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (mics: 0.5 and 4 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (mics: 0.25 and 4 mg/l). the duration of urine bactericidal activity (uba) was based upon the median bactericidal titre at each  time period. both gatifloxacin and levofloxacin exhibited prolonged (> or = 6 h)  uba against all of the study isolates. moxifloxacin exhibited prolonged uba against both isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae and e. faecalis but not against either strain of p. aeruginosa. prolonged uba was not observed for trovafloxacin  against the moderately-susceptible strains with the exception of e. faecalis. furthermore, uba was not observed for trovafloxacin against the susceptible strain of p. aeruginosa. although these newer fluoroquinolones exhibited similar  in vitro activity against these uropathogens, only those compounds with the highest urinary concentrations (gatifloxacin and levofloxacin) produced prolonged uba against both strains of p. aeruginosa. the findings from this study suggest that both microbiological activity and urinary concentrations are important parameters to consider when choosing a fluoroquinolone for empirical treatment of urinary tract infections (utis).

TI  == evaluation of the hyplex bloodscreen multiplex pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.
AB  == we evaluated the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) system (bag, lich, germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification  of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive bactec 9240 blood culture bottles. the test involves amplification of the bacterial dna by multiplex pcr and subsequent hybridization  of the pcr product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an elisa-based format. the available probes allow the separate detection of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal meca  gene. the hyplex bloodscreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (s. aureus, 100%; s. epidermidis, 97.2%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). the specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (escherichia coli, 92.5%; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; klebsiella spp., 100%; enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; s. aureus, 100%, s. epidermidis, 97.7%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus  faecium, 99.6%; streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). the result of the meca gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of staphylococcus aureus investigated. in conclusion, the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-elisa system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the meca gene of staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.

TI  == infective endocarditis in patients with liver cirrhosis.
AB  == background and purpose: infective endocarditis complicating liver cirrhosis is infrequently reported. this study evaluated the clinical features of infective endocarditis in taiwanese patients with liver cirrhosis. methods: all cases of infective endocarditis occurring in patients with liver cirrhosis from december 1995 to december 2002 were included in this study. data were collected by retrospective chart review. results: twenty six patients (18 males, 8 females) with median age 6 years (range, 43 to 87) were included. the etiology of liver cirrhosis was hepatitis virus infection in 20 patients. there were 7 nosocomial infections. bacterial pathogens were identified in 25 patients, with staphylococcus aureus (n = 8), viridans streptococci (n = 4), streptococcus sanguis (n = 2), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2), and enterococcus faecalis (n = 2) the most common isolates. the hospital mortality rate was 27%. patients with in-hospital death were more likely to have a history of uremia, staphylococcal infection, nosocomial infection and less likely to have aortic valve infection. conclusions: the prognosis of patients with infective endocarditis and liver cirrhosis was poor. infection with staphylococcus species was a dominant cause and methicillin resistance was common.

TI  == relationship between antibacterial activity of chitosan and surface characteristics of cell wall.
AB  == aim: five representative waterborne pathogens were used to illustrate the relationship between chitosan's antibacterial activity and the surface characteristics of the bacterial cell wall. methods: chitosan was prepared with averaged 75% or 95% deacetylated degree to examine its antibacterial activity against waterborne pathogens. fresh microbial inoculants for the antibacterial assessment were prepared on nutrient agar at 37 degrees for 24 h. the evaluation  items of antibacterial mechanism included hydrophilicity and negative charge analysis of cell surface, and adsorptive characteristics of chitosan to bacterial cell. all the experiments were applied in triplicate tests at least. results: although cell wall hydrophilicity was similar among gram-negative bacteria, the distribution of negative charge on their cell surfaces was quite different. more  negatively charged cell surfaces had a greater interaction with chitosan, a phenomenon further confirmed by transmission electron micrography (tem). conclusion: results showed the hydrophilicity in gram-negative bacteria was much  higher than in gram-positive ones. the correlation coefficient 0.988 between the  amount of absorbed chitosan and its inhibition efficiency indicated a close relationship.

TI  == traditional medicine in north cote-d'ivoire: screening of 50 medicinal plants for antibacterial activity.
AB  == sixty-seven crude ethanol extracts from 50 plants (31 families), which are used in north cote-d'ivoire as traditional remedies for bacterial diseases, were screened for in vitro activity against gram negative (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and bacillus subtilis) bacteria. thirty-one extracts showed antibacterial activity only on gram positive bacteria. of these,  10 extracts from 10 plant species had a promising level of activity against bacteria including strains resistant to antibiotics such as aminosides, penicillin m, macrolides, lincosamide and streptrogramin b. the most active was erythrina senegalensis dc (fabaceae) followed by bobgunnia madagascariensis (desv.) j.h. kirkbr. & wiersema (caesalpinaceae), waltheria lanceolata r. br. ex  mast. (sterculiaceae), uapaca togoensis pax. (euphorbiaceae), ximenia americana l. (olacaceae), khaya senegalensis (ders.) a. juss. (meliaceae), lannea acida a.  rich. (anacardiaceae), cissus populnea guill. & perr. (vitaceae), keetia hispida  (benth.) bridson (rubiaceae) and ficus thonningii (miq.) a. rich. (moraceae). this is the first report of the antibacterial potency of these 10 plant species on a range of bacteria. the results provided evidence that some of the studied plants might indeed be potential sources of new antibacterial agents, also against some antibiotic-resistant strains.

TI  == the effects of chlorhexidine gluconate (0.12%) on the antimicrobial properties of tooth-colored proroot mineral trioxide aggregate.
AB  == the purpose of this in vitro study was to determine whether the substitution of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for sterile water as a mixing agent would enhance the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored proroot mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) against actinomyces odontolyticus (atcc17982), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc2586), streptococcus sanguis (atcc10556), enterococcus faecalis (er3/2s), escherichia coli (sm10lambdapir), staphylococcus aureus (atcc6538), pseudomonas aeruginosa (ume), and candida albicans (atcc10261). two wells of 5-mm diameter were made in triplicate agar plates inoculated with standardized suspensions of each microorganism. mta (33 mg) mixed with chlorhexidine (12 microl) or sterile water (12 microl) was placed to fill each well. plates were incubated at 37 degrees c as required for microbial growth. a blinded, independent observer measured zones of inhibition. all mta samples inhibited microbial growth regardless of mixing agent. mta/chlorhexidine showed significantly larger zones of inhibition (p < 0.0002, paired t test). in conclusion, substituting 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for water enhanced the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored proroot mta.

TI  == chemometric studies on the bactericidal activity of quinolones via an extended volsurf approach.
AB  == an extended volsurf approach, that additionally includes shape descriptors, was applied to a dataset of 55 quinolones. bactericidal activity was measured at bayer ag, germany, for gram-negative (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis). chemometric analysis was first approached via a classical volsurf approach. the following descriptors were found most important: bactericidal activity particularly increases with high values of the best volume (bv11(oh2)) and the minimum energy (emin1(oh2)) of the water probe, high values of the integy moment (id(dry)) of the lipophilic probe, and high values of the hydrophilic region (w(o)) of the hydrogen bond acceptor probe. best volume (bv31(oh2)) of the water probe and best volume (bv12(dry)) and lipophilic regions (d(dry)) of the lipophilic probe as well as h-bonding capacity derived with the co probe (hb(o))  are inversely related to activity. pls analysis yields a five-component model with an r(2) of 0.83 and a q(2) of 0.43 after variable selection via fractional factorial design (ffd). chemometric modeling could be improved by including newly derived shape descriptors, which were merged with the volsurf descriptors and subjected to pls analysis. the global model of this extended volsurf approach is  optimal with two components and exhibits a significantly improved statistical quality; a marginally reduced r(2) (0.75 versus 0.83) is more than compensated by a highly improved predictivity with a q(2) of 0.63 versus 0.43. to prove model quality, external prediction of seven test set quinolones was performed. the precise prediction of all test set molecules nicely demonstrates the robustness and statistical significance of the obtained chemometric model using the extended volsurf approach.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of the pathogens of bacteraemia in the uk and ireland 2001-2002: the bsac bacteraemia resistance surveillance programme.
AB  == objectives: to describe the current patterns of antimicrobial resistance in the major pathogens of bacteraemia in the uk and ireland, to highlight any unexpected resistance patterns and to act as a reference baseline for future studies. methods: in 2001 and 2002, 5092 blood culture isolates were collected by 29 laboratories distributed across the uk and ireland. a single central laboratory re-identified the isolates and measured mics by the bsac agar dilution method. results: oxacillin resistance was found in 42% of staphylococcus aureus and 76% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. streptococci were generally susceptible to beta-lactams, but tetracycline resistance was common (except in streptococcus pneumoniae) and particularly common among group b isolates (82% resistant). nine  percent of s. pneumoniae had reduced susceptibility to penicillin (mics 0.12-1 mg/l), but none required >/=2 mg/l for inhibition. high-level gentamicin resistance was seen in 43% of enterococcus faecalis, often in combination with raised ciprofloxacin mics (>/=32 mg/l), but these isolates remained susceptible to ampicillin and imipenem. only linezolid and tigecycline showed in vitro potency against a large proportion of enterococcus faecium. vancomycin resistance was restricted to enterococci (20% of e. faecium, 3% of e. faecalis) and a single isolate of coagulase-negative staphylococci (0.2%, mic of 8 mg/l). escherichia coli isolates were commonly resistant to amoxicillin (56%) and tetracycline (88%) but remained susceptible to ceftazidime, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in 2% of e. coli (none in 2001, 3.2% in 2002), 5% of klebsiella spp. and 8% of enterobacter spp. resistance rates of pseudomonas aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, gentamicin, imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam were between 4% and 7%. among the newly licensed and developmental agents, there was no resistance to linezolid in gram-positive organisms. ertapenem had a wide spectrum, covering enterobacteriaceae, streptococci and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci. mics of tigecycline were low for gram-positive species and enterobacteriaceae except proteeae and enterobacter spp. conclusion: antimicrobial resistance among major bloodstream pathogens to those antimicrobials often selected for empirical therapy was relatively uncommon in 2001-2002, usually <10%. an important exception was oxacillin resistance in s. aureus.

AB  == tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from april 2002 to march 2003 were investigated in a multicenter study in  japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 334 strains were  isolated from 131 (75.3%) of 174 patients with surgical infections. one hundred and seventy-one strains were isolated from primary infections, and 163 strains were isolated from post-operative infections. from primary infections, anaerobic  gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant from postoperative infections. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, although the isolation rate of staphylococcus aureus was the highest, followed by that of enterococcus faecalis from primary infections, the isolation  rate of e. faecalis was the highest from postoperative infections. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this  order, and from postoperative infections, e. coli was the most predominantly isolated, followed by p. aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, and citobacter freundii. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-negative bacteria from primary infections and that of aerobic gram-positive bacteria from postoperative infections were high in the  last several years. we noticed no vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci nor p. aeruginosa producing metallo-beta-lactamase. but we noticed cefazolin-resistant e. coli probably producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase.

TI  == commensal gram-negative bacteria prime human dendritic cells for enhanced il-23 and il-27 expression and enhanced th1 development.
AB  == dendritic cells (dc) are the main orchestrators of specific immune responses. depending on microbial information they encounter in peripheral tissues, they promote the development of th1, th2 or unpolarized th cell responses. in this study we have investigated the immunomodulatory effect of non-pathogenic intestinal gram-negative (escherichia coli, bacteroides vulgatus,veillonella parvula, pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram-positive (bifidobacterium adolescentis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus plantarum and staphylococcus aureus) bacteria on human monocyte-derived dc (modc). none of the gram-positive bacteria  (gpb) primed for th1 or th2 development. in contrast, despite the low levels of il-12 they induce, all gram-negative bacteria (gnb) primed modc for enhanced th1  cell development, which was dependent on il-12 and an additional unidentified cofactor. strikingly, gnb-matured modc expressed elevated levels of p19 and p28 mrna, the critical subunits of il-23 and il-27, respectively, suggesting that the il-12 family members may jointly be responsible for their th1-driving capacity. purified major cell wall components of either gnb or gpb did not yield th cell profiles identical to those obtained with whole bacteria, and could not explain the induction of the il-12 family members nor th1 priming by gnb. importantly, this study gives indications that the expression of the different il-12 family members is dictated by different priming conditions of immature dc.

TI  == the antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  == previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against gram- escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against gram+ micrococcus sp., is melanization. we examined the immune responses mounted by aedes aegypti towards gram- enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium, and gram+ bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial gram type and pathogenicity. these data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to  the immune response against prokaryotes.

AB  == calcium hydroxide is the "gold standard" endodontic medication, but it may fail to eliminate certain facultative bacteria and yeasts found in root canal systems. in this study, standardized bovine dentin blocks infected with enterococcus faecalis were treated with an aqueous calcium hydroxide or bioactive glass s53p4  (bag) powder suspension. while calcium hydroxide was ineffective, the bag suspension eliminated the infection in the sampled dentin layers after 5 days. in a direct exposure test, preincubation with human dentin boosted the bag-killing efficacy against e. faecalis atcc29212, candida albicans ccug19915, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc9027, streptococcus sanguis atcc10556, and s. mutans atcc25175. bag placed in the root canals of extracted teeth did not alter root-dentin ph. consequently, the conditions under which the microbiota were killed were not ph-mediated. further studies are ongoing to help clarify the antimicrobial bag effect in the presence of dentin.

TI  == the possible influence of micro-organisms and putrefaction in the production of ghb in post-mortem biological fluid.
AB  == in recent years, the post-mortem production of the drug of abuse gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (ghb) in biological fluids (e.g. blood and urine) has caused various interpretative problems for toxicologists. previously, other researchers have shown certain microbial species (pseudomonas spp. and clostridium aminobutyricum) possess the necessary enzymes to convert gaba to ghb. a preliminary investigation involving putrefied post-mortem blood indicated there was no observed relationship between "endogenous" ghb concentrations and concentrations of common putrefactive markers (tryptamine and phenyl-2-ethylamine). microbiological analysis identified the presence of various micro-organisms: clostridia spp., escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, enterococcus faecalis and aeromonoas spp. equine plasma, human blood and urine samples were inoculated with these and an additional micro-organism (pseudomonas  aeruginosa) and incubated at 22 degrees c for 1 month. following comparison with  control samples and pre-inoculation concentrations, the data indicated an apparent production of ghb in unpreserved p. aeruginosa inoculated blood (2.3 mg/l). all other fluoride-preserved and unpreserved samples (including controls)  had ghb concentrations <1mg/l. although this concentration is lower than is typically associated with "endogenous" post-mortem ghb concentrations, this paper proposes a potential microbial production of ghb with time.

AB  == in an open randomised double-crossover study 12 volunteers (six men, six women) received a single oral dose of gatifloxacin (400 mg) or ciprofloxacin (500 mg) to assess urinary bactericidal activity (in eight intervals up to 120 h) and pharmacokinetic (pk) parameters (up to 36 h). plasma concentrations and urinary excretion were determined by hplc with fluorescence detection, and urinary bactericidal titers (ubt) by microdilution-method, using antibiotic-free urine of each volunteer. the mean maximum plasma concentration of gatifloxacin was 3.35 mg/l and that of ciprofloxacin 2.12 mg/l. the mean (median) cumulative renal excretion of the parent drug was for gatifloxacin 81 (83)% of the administered dose within 120 h and for ciprofloxacin 43 (45)%. the ubts, i.e. the highest two-fold dilution (antibiotic-free urine as diluent) of urine still being bactericidal, were determined for an escherichia coli atcc reference strain and nine clinical uropathogens with the following mics (mg/l) for gatifloxacin/ciprofloxacin (microdilution, mhb): e. coli atcc 25922 (0.008/0.008); e. coli 523 (0.06/0.06); klebsiella pneumoniae 1058 (0.03/0.016);  proteus mirabilis 524 (0.125/0.016); pseudomonas aeruginosa 561 (1/0.125); enterococcus faecalis strains 60 an 55 (0.5/1 and 8/32); staphylococcus aureus strains 248 and 596 (both 0.03/0.125) and s. saprophyticus ho94 (0.125/0.25). the median ubts measured within the first 6h for gatifloxacin were between 1:16 and 1:>or=1024 for the gram-negative strains including p. aeruginosa and between 1:8  and 1:>or=1024 for the five gram-positive strains. the median ubts for ciprofloxacin were between 1:64 and 1:>or=1024 for the gram-negative strains (incl p. aeruginosa) and between 1:1.5 and 1:768 for the five gram-positive strains. the ubts up to 12 < 0.05 h showed no difference (p<0.05 ) for both e. coli strains, but ciprofloxacin was superior to gatifloxacin against klebsiella,  proteus and pseudomonas strains and gatifloxacin was superior to ciprofloxacin against all gram-positive strains. for the ubts at 12-24 h, gatifloxacin was generally superior to ciprofloxacin, but showed no difference in the proteus and  pseudomonas strains. the areas under the ubt-time-curve (aubt) up to 120 h showed statistically significant (p ) differences between both quinolones in favour of gatifloxacin against 8 of 10 strains tested, no difference for p. mirabilis and significantly higher activity of ciprofloxacin against p. aeruginosa. in conclusion, gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin had overall comparable initial urinary bactericidal activity with some differences for specific pathogens, some times in favour of gatifloxacin (gram-positives) and some times of ciprofloxacin (usually  gram-negatives), suggesting that for empiric therapy a single oral dose of gatifloxacin (400mg) would be clinically equivalent to ciprofloxacin (500 mg) twice daily-in agreement with the results of a clinical study in complicated uti  performed previously [int. j. antimicrob. agents (2004)].

TI  == antimicrobial activities of heparin-binding peptides.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides are effector molecules of the innate immune system. we recently showed that the human antimicrobial peptides alpha-defensin and ll-37 bind to glycosaminoglycans (heparin and dermatan sulphate). here we demonstrate the obverse, i.e. structural motifs associated with heparin affinity (cationicity, amphipaticity, and consensus regions) may confer antimicrobial properties to a given peptide. thus, heparin-binding peptides derived from laminin isoforms, von willebrand factor, vitronectin, protein c inhibitor, and fibronectin, exerted antimicrobial activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. similar results were obtained using heparin-binding peptides derived from complement factor c3 as well as consensus sequences for heparin-binding (cardin and weintraub motifs). these sequence motifs, and additional peptides, also killed the fungus candida albicans. these data will have implications for the search for novel antimicrobial peptides and utilization of heparin-protein interactions should be helpful in the identification and purification of novel antimicrobial peptides from complex biological mixtures. finally, consensus regions may serve as templates for de novo synthesis of novel  antimicrobial molecules.

AB  == the bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa) isolated from patients diagnosed as urinary tract infections (utis) in 10 institutions in japan were supplied between september and december, 2001. then, the susceptibilities of these bacteria to various antimicrobial agents were examined, and the results were compared with those obtained between 1992 and 2000. comparison was made by classifying strains  isolated from patients into those in uncomplicated utis and those in complicated  utis (including with or without indwelling catheter). the drug sensitivity of s.  aureus in this year was comparable to those in up to the previous year, and s. aureus showed the best susceptibility to vancomycin (vcm). e. faecalis showed good susceptibility to ampicillin and imipenem, and the mic90s were 2 micrograms/ml. the susceptibility of e. faecalis to vcm was also good. e. coli showed good susceptibility to the drugs except penicillins. among cephems, the susceptibility to cefozopran (czop) was better (mic90: < or = 0.125 microgram/ml). just as the last report, the decreases in susceptibility of e. coli to quinolones were also observed in the patients with complicated utis. the  susceptibility of klebsiella spp. to all the test drugs did not significantly change in 2001 and was generally good but not to penicillins. among cephems, klebsiella spp. showed good susceptibility to flomoxef, cefpirome, cefixime, and  czop with < or = 0.125 microgram/ml of mic90s either in uncomplicated or complicated utis. although the drug sensitivity of p. aeruginosa was generally low, the detection of the strains that showed good susceptibility to quinolones and carbapenems (mic: < or = 0.125-2 micrograms/ml) were relatively frequent.

TI  == [nationwide sensitivity surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antibiotics against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--the first ciproxan iv special investigation in 2001].
AB  == the parenteral injection of ciprofloxacin (cpfx), a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial drug, was approved in september 2000 and a re-examination period of 6 years was set at that time. as a special investigation to apply for re-examination of this  drug, it has been planned to conduct 3 nationwide surveillances during the re-examination period by collecting clinically isolated bacteria from patients with severe infections, to whom the drug was mainly indicated, and examining drug susceptibilities of the bacteria to various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including cpfx. this time, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including cpfx against 1,220 strains isolated from patients with severe infections by the micro-liquid dilution method and compared susceptibilities of various clinically isolated bacteria to cpfx with those to other antimicrobial drugs. gram-positive bacteria  were less susceptible to cpfx than to carbapenems except 2 bacterial species, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus avium but susceptibilities of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), staphylococcus epidermidis  and enterococcus faecalis to cpfx were comparable to those to cefozopran. susceptibility of streptococcus pneumoniae to cpfx did not differ among ampicillin (abpc)-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic of abpc: < 0.25 microgram/ml), abpc-intermediate s. pneumoniae (mic of abpc: 0.25-2 micrograms/ml) and abpc-resistant s. pneumoniae (mic of abpc: > or = 4 micrograms/ml) mic90 of cpfx: 1 microgram/ml) and a decrease in the antimicrobial activity seen among cephem and carbapenem antimicrobial drugs against penicillin-intermediate strains was not noted with cpfx. gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to cpfx similarly to carbapenems and the mic90 values of cpfx were in the range from < or = 0.063 to 2 micrograms/ml against strains except stenotrophomonas maltophilia and burkholderia cepacia. pseudomonas aeruginosa was most susceptible to cpfx among the antibacterial drugs examined and the mic90 was 2 micrograms/ml. cpfx also showed the lowest mic90 value (0.5 microgram/ml) against beta-lactam-resistant p. aeruginosa among the drugs examined. when extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production and class b beta-lactamase production were examined in 439 strains of enterobacteriaceae and 168 strains of  glucose non-fermentative bacteria out of the gram-negative bacteria collected this time, 3 strains (0.49%) producing esbl and 7 strains (1.15%) producing class b beta-lactamase were found. the mic range of cpfx to these 10 strains was between < or = 0.063 to 8 micrograms/ml and 5 strains among those showed susceptibilities (mic of cpfx: 1 microgram/ml) based on the nccls breakpoint. cpfx also showed a satisfactory result concerning susceptibilities of major causal bacteria based on the report of the committee of japan society of chemotherapy on the standard method for determination of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, the breakpoint of pneumonia. furthermore, susceptibilities  of various bacteria isolated clinically from patients with severe infections this time did not differ much from the result of the nationwide surveillance which we  conducted in 1997. thus, it was concluded that the antimicrobial activity of cpfx was maintained in the post-marketing surveillance for its parenteral preparation.

TI  == high antibiotic susceptibility among bacterial pathogens in swedish icus. report  from a nation-wide surveillance program using ta90 as a novel index of susceptibility.
AB  == local infection control measures, antibiotic consumption and patient demographics from 1999-2000 together with bacteriological analyses were investigated in 29 icus participating in the icu-strama programme. the median antibiotic consumption per icu was 1147 (range 605-2143) daily doses per 1000 occupied bed d (ddd1000).  antibiotics to which > 90% of isolates of an organism were susceptible were defined as treatment alternatives (ta90). the mean number of ta90 was low (1-2 per organism) for enterococcus faecium (vancomycin:van), coagulase negative staphylococci (van), pseudomonas aeruginosa (ceftazidime:ctz, netilmicin: net) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (ctz, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole: tsu), but higher (3-7) for acinetobacter spp. (imipenem:imi, net, tsu), enterococcus faecalis (ampicillin:amp, imi, van), serratia spp. (ciprofloxacin:cip, imi, net), enterobacter spp. (cip, imi, net, tsu), e. coli (cefuroxime:cxm, cefotaxime/eftazidime:ctx/ctz, cip, imi, net, piperacillin-tazobactam:ptz, tsu),  klebsiella spp. (ctx/ctz cip, imi, net, ptz, tsu) and staphylococcus aureus (clindamycin, fusidic acid, net, oxacillin, rifampicin, van). of s. aureus isolates 2% were mrsa. facilities for alcohol hand disinfection at each bed were  available in 96% of the icus. the numbers of ta90 available were apparently higher than in icus in southern europe and the us, despite a relatively high antibiotic consumption. this may be due to a moderate ecological impact of the used agents and the infection control routines in swedish icus.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  == the ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. these pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. these infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer  generations of antibiotics. in this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis  and endophthalmitis. the ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis. mic90 values for the drugs  against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/ml to 0.57 mg/ml and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. the mic90 for gatifloxacin against streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/ml compared with 0.73 mg/ml for moxifloxacin (p = .011). among the gram-negative isolates, the mean mic90 for gatifloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/ml compared with 2.60 mg/ ml for moxifloxacin (p = .023).  mic90 values for gatifloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. for the atypicals, the mic90 values for gatifloxacin against nocardia asteroides and mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.

TI  == microbial flora in ileal and colonic neobladders.
AB  == objective: to describe bacterial colonization in patients with ileal and colonic  neobladders. methods: twenty-three patients with right colon neobladders, 30 with ileal neobladders, 11 who had undergone radical prostatectomy, and 6 healthy controls were included. culture of clean-catch, midstream urine specimens was done weekly for 3 weeks, and this was repeated after 6 months. residual urine was measured, and the patients were interviewed about leakage. all patients and controls were antibiotic free during the study except for 13 of the ileal neobladder patients, who were treated with trimethoprim 100mg daily. results: urine cultures from controls and prostatectomy patients were negative for bacteria, whereas 67% of the specimens from patients with neobladders, not on antibiotic therapy, were culture positive, and half of these contained uropathogenic species, such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococcus faecalis. bacterial colonization (including uropathogenic strains) was strongly correlated with residual urine (p<0.005), but not with leakage. anaerobic strains were found more frequently (p=0.04) in urine from ileal neobladders than in urine from colonic neobladders.  the 13 patients with ileal neobladders and on prophylactic antibiotic therapy carried bacteriuria in 80% of the samples, the majority being anaerobic strains.  uropathogenic strains, mainly enterecoccus faecalis was revealed in 30% of the samples. conclusions: the lower urinary tract of patients with ileal or colonic neobladders is heavily colonized with potentially uropathogenic and anaerobic bacteria. complete bladder emptying reduces the bacterial burden. anaerobic colonization is increased in neobladders reconstructed from ileum. prophylactic antibiotic therapy does not seem to reduce the bacterial burden, but interferes with the bacterial composition.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of moxifloxacin compared to other quinolones against recent clinical bacterial isolates from hospitalized and community-based  cancer patients.
AB  == the in vitro spectrum of moxifloxacin (a c-8-methoxyquinolone) was compared to that of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against 924 recent clinical isolates from  cancer patients. moxifloxacin was more active than the comparator agents against  gram-positive pathogens, with potent activity against aerococcus spp., listeria monocytogenes, micrococcus spp., rhodococcus equi, and stomatococcus mucilaginous, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus spp., all beta hemolytic streptococci, viridans streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae. it also had good to moderate activity against bacillus spp., corynebacterium spp., enterococcus faecalis, and methicillin-resistant staphylococci. although ciprofloxacin was the most active agent tested against the enterobacteriaceae, moxifloxacin inhibited the majority of these isolates at < or =2.0 microg/ml. moxifloxacin was the least active of the three agents tested against pseudomonas  aeruginosa, but had significant activity against other non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli including acinetobacter spp., flavobacterium spp., pseudomonas spp. other than p. aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. the  overall broad spectrum of moxifloxacin, and its availability for both oral and parenteral administration, warrants its evaluation for the prevention and treatment of infections in cancer patients.

TI  == leitbakteria of microbial biofilm communities causing occlusion of biliary stents.
AB  == biliary stents inserted to relieve obstructive jaundice caused by biliary or pancreatic malignancies inevitably become occluded by microbial growth in the form of diverse microbial community biofilms. the scarce information available on these communities is based on cultivation methods, but such methods usually provide distorted overviews of community composition, so commonalities and differences in biliary stent communities are uncertain. we extracted dna and rna  from the microbial communities of 11 biliary stents explanted from nine patients  in hospitals from two different countries, amplified 16s rrna and rdna sequences, analysed the amplicons by the single-strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) method, and sequenced and deduced phylogenetic assignments of the major amplicons representing the major biofilm community members. we used a modified robbins device (mrd) to study de novo development of a stent biofilm from a patient stent microbial community. single-strand conformation polymorphism fingerprinting revealed the same six abundant bacterial species, here designated leitbakteria, namely klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and two unculturable bacteria distantly related to e. coli and shigella sonnei, in all of the stent biofilm communities. in the experimental biliary stent system, a sequential colonization of the stent surface was observed, with p. aeruginosa being the pioneer colonizer, followed by k. pneumoniae and one of the unculturable leitbakteria, followed by the remainder of the community. the overview of microbial biofilm communities of biliary stents gained by the use of culture-independent methods revealed new unculturable bacteria as major members of biliary stent biofilms, and the diversity of the abundant members of the stent biofilms is considerably lower than suggested from  earlier studies based on cultivation methods, and that communities from different stents from different patients in different countries are remarkably similar and  have similar major members, the stent leitbakteria.

TI  == identification of species of brucella using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
AB  == fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir) is a technique that has been used  over the years in chemical analysis for the identification of substances and is one that may be applied to the characterisation of microorganisms. the marked tendency of brucella towards variation in the smooth rough phase, together with the laboriousness and risk involved in the methods used in their identification,  make their classification difficult. we studied the type strains of the different species and biovars of brucella and 11 isolates of human origin of brucella melitensis, six corresponding to biovar 1, one to biovar 2 and five to biovar 3.  the results of linear discriminant analysis performed using the data provide an above 95% likelihood of correct classification, over half of which are in fact above 99% for the vast majority of brucella strains. only one case of b. melitensis biovar 1 has been incorrectly classified. the rest of the microorganisms studied (staphylococcus aureus, strteptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, acinetobacter calcoaceticus and pseudomonas aeruginosa) have been classified correctly in all cases to a likelihood of over 80%. in the graphic representation of the analysis, a grouping of these can be seen in clusters, which include the different species. one of these comprises b.  melitensis, another brucella abortus, and another wider one is made up of brucella suis. the brucella canis, brucella ovis and brucella neotomae strains appear separate from the previously described groups.

TI  == soft antimicrobial agents: synthesis and activity of labile environmentally friendly long chain quaternary ammonium compounds.
AB  == a series of soft quaternary ammonium antimicrobial agents, which are analogues to currently used quaternary ammonium preservatives such as cetyl pyridinium chloride and benzalkonium chloride, were synthesized. these soft analogues consist of long alkyl chain connected to a polar headgroup via chemically labile  spacer group. they are characterized by facile nonenzymatic and enzymatic degradation to form their original nontoxic building blocks. however, their chemical stability has to be adequate in order for them to have antimicrobial effects. stability studies and antibacterial and antiviral activity measurements  revealed relationship between activity, lipophilicity, and stability. their minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was as low as 1 microg/ml, and their viral reduction was in some cases greater than 6.7 log. the structure-activity studies  demonstrate that the bioactive compounds (i.e., mic for gram-positive bacteria of <10 microg/ml) have an alkyl chain length between 12 and 18 carbon atoms, with a  polar headgroup preferably of a small quaternary ammonium group, and their acquired inactivation half-life must be greater than 3 h at 60 degrees c.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of 'mgp' gutta-percha in vitro.
AB  == aim: to determine whether 'mgp' gutta-percha (westport, ct, usa), a commercially  available gutta-percha containing iodoform, inhibits the growth of potential endodontic pathogens. methodology: inocula of enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus sanguis, fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces odontolyticus were spread onto the surface of agar plates. 'mgp' gutta-percha cones presoaked in sterile water were transferred to the inoculated agar and incubated at 37 degrees c aerobically or anaerobically as required for optimal growth. identical studies were performed using iodoform-free gutta-percha and sterile paper disks saturated with 10% povidone-iodine. following incubation, zones of inhibition around the 'mgp' gutta-percha, iodoform-free gutta-percha and disks were evaluated. results: povidone-iodine inhibited all the strains. iodoform-free gutta-percha inhibited s. sanguis and a. odontolyticus. 'mgp' gutta-percha inhibited s. aureus, s. sanguis, a. odontolyticus and f. nucleatum. neither iodoform-free gutta-percha nor 'mgp' gutta-percha inhibited growth of e. faecalis, e. coli or p. aeruginosa. conclusions: compared to iodoform-free gutta-percha, iodoform-containing 'mgp' gutta-percha had an inhibitory effect in vitro on s. aureus and f. nucleatum, but not on e. faecalis, e. coli or p. aeruginosa.

TI  == a comparison of the bacteria found on the hands of 'homemakers' and neonatal intensive care unit nurses.
AB  == this prevalence study was conducted to compare the counts, types and antimicrobial resistance profiles of bacterial flora on the hands of individuals  in the community to that of nurses at a nearby university teaching hospital, with an intense hand hygiene regimen. hand cultures were obtained from 204 individuals during a home visit and 119 nurses in two neonatal intensive care units (nicus).  the mean total log counts of organisms were 5.73 and 5.24 for the homemakers [defined as the person (usually the mother) who is the primary person responsible for arranging childcare, cooking, cleaning etc] and nurse hands, respectively (p<0.0001). significantly more homemakers had acinetobacter lwoffii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. fluorescens/putida, and staphylococcus aureus on their hands compared with the nurses (all p<0.05). however, significantly more nurses had enterococcus faecalis, s. epidermidis, and s. warneri on their hands (p<0.05). of note, the hands of nurses harboured significantly more s. epidermidis strains resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and oxacillin and s. warneri resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, and oxacillin (p<0.05). surprisingly, significantly more trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant s. epidermidis and ciprofloxacin-resistant s. warneri was recovered from the hands of homemakers (p<0.05). this study demonstrates differences in prevalence, bacterial composition and antimicrobial resistance of hand flora of hospital personnel compared with homemakers. moreover, the hands of homemakers may serve as community reservoirs for antimicrobial resistant strains of clinical importance.

TI  == nosocomial bloodstream infections in pediatric patients in united states hospitals: epidemiology, clinical features and susceptibilities.
AB  == background: we identified the predominant pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibilities of nosocomial bloodstream isolates in pediatric patients in the  us prospective surveillance for nosocomial bloodstream infections at 49 hospitals during a 6-year period [surveillance and control of pathogens of epidemiologic importance (scope)] detected 22 609 bloodstream infections, of which 3432 occurred in patients < or =16 years of age. results: gram-positive organisms accounted for 65% of cases, gram-negative organisms accounted for 24% of cases and 11% were caused by fungi. the overall crude mortality was 14% (475 of 3432) but notably higher for infections caused by candida spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa, 20 and 29%, respectively. the most common organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci (43%), enterococci, staphylococcus aureus and candida spp. (each, 9%). the mean interval between admission and infection averaged 21 days for coagulase-negative staphylococci, 25 days for s. aureus and  candida spp., 32 days for klebsiella spp. and 34 days for enterococcus spp. the proportion of methicillin-resistant s. aureus increased from 10% in 1995 to 29% in 2001. vancomycin-resistance was seen in 1% of enterococcus faecalis and in 11% of enterococcus faecium isolates. conclusion: nosocomial bsi occurred predominantly in very young and/or critically ill children. gram-positive pathogens predominated across all ages, and increasing antimicrobial resistance was observed in pediatric patients.

TI  == diverse effects of ascorbic acid and palmitoyl ascorbate on helicobacter pylori survival and growth.
AB  == among many antioxidants used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, ascorbic acid (aa) is one of the most important. aa has been suggested to decrease the risk of gastric disease (gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and carcinoma) by direct action on helicobacter pylori. however, there are limited studies on the possible role of aa and its derivatives such as palmitoyl ascorbate (pa) on the growth and survival of h. pylori. in the present study it was demonstrated in vitro that aa in the concentration range 10-20 mg x ml(-1) (50-100 mm) inhibited  h. pylori growth in liquid medium under microaerophilic conditions. in contrast,  under aerobic conditions aa in the concentration range 2-20 mg x ml(-1) (10-100 mm) significantly increased the survival of h. pylori presumably eliminating the  toxic effect of reactive oxygen species on bacterial cells. the hydrophobic derivative of aa, pa (a food antioxidant), demonstrated a strong antibacterial effect, under both aerobic and microaerophilic conditions in the concentration range 0.04-0.4 mg x ml(-1) (0.1-1.0 mm). this effect was also tested on other bacterial strains: escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, clostridium sporogenes and campylobacter jejuni. among these bacterial strains, pa showed a similar inhibitory effect on b. cereus and b. subtilis as observed with h. pylori. the results suggest that pa may be considered an important aa derivative  in eradication of h. pylori in vitro and in vivo and to decrease the risk for gastric diseases.

TI  == evaluation of the antimicrobial efficacy of urinary catheters impregnated with antiseptics in an in vitro urinary tract model.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the long-term efficacy of urinary foley catheters (latex  and silicone) impregnated with (1) chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine (cxs) and (2) chlorhexidine, silver sulfadiazine, and triclosan (cxst) in inhibiting extra-luminal bacterial adherence and to compare their efficacy with that of silver hydrogel latex (sh) and nitrofurazone-treated silicone (nf) catheters. design: the antimicrobial spectrum of these catheters was evaluated using a zone  of inhibition assay. a novel in vitro urinary tract model was developed to study  the potential in vivo efficacy of antimicrobial catheters in preventing extraluminal bacterial colonization. the "meatus" was inoculated daily with staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aerginosa, and candida albicans. the "bladder" portion of the model was cultured daily to determine bacterial growth. results: both cxs and cxst catheters had a broader antimicrobial spectrum than sh and nf catheters. in  the in vitro model, cxst latex and silicone catheters exhibited significantly better efficacy (3 to 25days) against uropathogens, compared with cxs (1 to 14 days) and control (0 to 5 days) catheters (p = .01). cxst latex catheters exhibited significantly longer protection against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, compared with sh catheters (p = .01). cxst silicone catheters resisted colonization with staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis for a significantly longer period (23 to 24 days) than did nf catheters (9 to 11 days)  (p = .01). conclusion: catheters impregnated with synergistic combinations of chlorhexidine, silver sulfadiazine, and triclosan exhibited broad-spectrum, long-term resistance against microbial colonization on their outer surfaces.

TI  == in vitro activities of novel oxapenems, alone and in combination with ceftazidime, against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms.
AB  == four novel oxapenem compounds (i.e., am-112, am-113, am-114, and am-115) were investigated for their beta-lactamase inhibitory activity against a panel of isolated class a, c, and d enzymes, which included expanded-spectrum beta-lactamase enzymes (esbls). the oxapenems were potent beta-lactamase inhibitors. activity varied within the group, with am-113 and am-114 proving to be the most active compounds. the 50% inhibitory concentrations for these agents  were up to 100,000-fold lower than that of clavulanic acid against class c and d  enzymes. as a group, the oxapenems were more potent than clavulanic acid against  enzymes from all classes. the ability of these compounds to protect ceftazidime from hydrolysis by beta-lactamase-producing strains was evaluated by mic tests that combined ceftazidime and each oxapenem in a 1:1 or 2:1 ratio. the oxapenems  markedly reduced the mics for ceftazidime against class c hyperproducing strains  and strains producing tem- and shv-derived esbls. there was little difference between the activity of 1:1 and 2:1 combinations of ceftazidime and oxapenem. the oxapenems failed to enhance the activity of ceftazidime against derepressed ampc-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa strains.

TI  == lavage of contaminated surfaces: an in vitro evaluation of the effectiveness of different systems.
AB  == introduction: lavage is an effective, additive therapeutic procedure with a broad application in surgery. in addition to irrigation with the conventional syringe,  the pulsed jet lavage system is used. the effectiveness of bacterial reduction depends on, among other things, the irrigation pressure. complications of high-irrigation pressure in bone and joint surgery are intramedullary seeding of  bacteria, visible damage of the bone, or delayed healing of the fracture by lavage of the fracture zone. the purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effectiveness of mechanical irrigation on several surfaces using different systems of irrigation. materials and methods: four different test surfaces (nonbiological surfaces: sterilized bone cement and titanium osteosynthesis plates; biological surfaces: gamma-irradiated bovine muscle and cancellous bone)  were contaminated with a defined suspension of different bacterial species (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa). the samples were irrigated with three different systems (conventional 50-ml plastic syringe, manual pump irrigator, jet lavage) in a standardized, randomized experimental setup. after irrigation of the sample the amount of residual bacteria (colony-forming units) was determined. results: an effective bacterial reduction was achieved with the use of irrigation regardless of the system that was used and surface that was cleaned. on average p. aeruginosa was reduced around log 1.907, e. faecalis around log 1.666 and s. aureus around log 1.506. on biological surfaces, a reduction around log 0.801 for muscle and around log 1.738 for bone samples was achieved independent of the system that was used for irrigation. for the titanium surface a reduction of log 1.652 compared with log 2.580 for the bone cement surface was demonstrated. statistical analysis showed that mechanical lavage resulted in a significant reduction of all tested bacterial species on the surfaces. the best bacterial reduction was achieved with the manual pump irrigator (p = 0.06). the results demonstrate that the manual pump irrigator achieved significantly better bacterial reduction (p = 0.039) on "biological surfaces" (bone and muscle) compared with nonbiological surfaces (titanium and cement). conclusion: the results show that irrigation is an effective technique for bacterial reduction on contaminated surfaces. a remarkable finding was the limited bacterial reduction of staphylococcus aureus from gamma-sterilized muscle. the use of a continuous manual pump irrigator showed a greater reduction of bacteria contamination compared with the other means of irrigation investigated. in conclusion, the manual continuous irrigation system proved to be practical, economical and effective in reducing the bacterial load on various surfaces.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and interference of tobramycin and chloramphenicol on bacterial adhesion to intraocular lenses.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities of tobramycin and chloramphenicol were evaluated by  determining minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, group a, group b and group g streptococci, klebsiella spp., stenotrophomonas maltophilia and ciprofloxacin-resistant and -susceptible pseudomonas aeruginosa,  as well as by evaluating interference on adhesion of slime producer strains of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa to intraocular lens from tobramycin and chloramphenicol  pharmaceutical products by scanning electron microscopy. chloramphenicol was more active against gram-positive bacteria than was tobramycin, which instead showed higher activity against ciprofloxacin-susceptible p. aeruginosa. treatment of lenses with the antimicrobial products eradicated the bacterial biofilm, which was already notably reduced after 5 min. this activity was more pronounced for chloramphenicol against s. aureus and for tobramycin against p. aeruginosa. bacterial adhesion was also significantly reduced when lenses colonized by p. aeruginosa were treated with chloramphenicol, even if they were resistant to this drug. in conclusion, the tested drugs showed marked antibacterial activity, particularly by interfering with bacterial biofilms. the data obtained in this study suggest a specific use of chloramphenicol in topical prophylaxis aimed at avoiding bacterial contaminations. however, further specific in vivo studies are  needed to confirm these data.

TI  == crayfish broth for bacterial culture.
AB  == objective: to formulate a new growth medium for bacteriological studies. methods: sun dried white shrimps, nematopalaemon hastatus, were ground into fine powder and infused in distilled water at 7+/-1 degrees c for 24 h. the ph of the infusion was adjusted to 7.2 with naoh (0.1 m) and hcl (0.1 m) and evaporated to  dryness. crayfish broth (cb) was produced by reconstituting the concentrate in distilled water and sodium chloride was added at 0.9% w/v. crayfish infusion agar (cia) and crayfish starch agar (csa) were prepared with cb as nutrient base. the  crayfish broth and agar were evaluated alongside with nutrient broth and agar (oxoid) for ability to support growth of pathogens such as escherichia coli, klebsiella aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. crayfish broth was tested for suitability for sugar fermentation and indole test and results compared with those obtained with peptone water. its suitability as a sensitivity test medium was evaluated using ampicillin (10 microg) and gentamicin (10 microg) discs and results compared with those obtained using mueller-hinton agar (oxoid). results: crayfish broth comprises crayfish infusion concentrate 3.5 g and sodium chloride 9.0 g dissolved in one litre of distilled water. the crayfish broth, csa supported the growth of  the test pathogens with cultural characteristics similar to those seen on nutrient agar. the ph of the spent crayfish broth was near neutral (ph 6.9). the  broth was as important as peptone water for sugar fermentation test but was not suitable for indole test. the results of antibiotic susceptibility test on cia were comparable with those obtained on mueller-hinton agar with difference in zone diameters of not more than 1 mm. conclusion: crayfish broth possesses enormous potential as a new growth medium for bacterial studies.

TI  == a prospective study of infections in lung cancer patients admitted to the hospital.
AB  == study objectives: to determine the type of infections occurring in hospitalized patients with lung cancer. design: prospective cohort study. setting: department  of internal medicine in a cancer hospital. patients: all patients with lung cancer who were hospitalized for any cause and who acquired infections at the time of admission or during the hospital stay between january 1997 and february 2001. interventions: none. results: two hundred seventy-five patients with lung cancer had 435 episodes of fever and/or microbiologically or otherwise documented infection. two hundred eighteen patients (79.3%) presented with non-small cell lung carcinoma, while 49 patients (17.8%) had small cell lung cancer. the majority of the infections occurred in the tracheobronchial tree (56%). there were 38 episodes of bacteremia or fungemia, and the primary site of infection was identified in 18 cases (47%). microbiologically documented infections accounted for 61% of the infectious episodes, and included a total of 312 microorganisms. the most frequent pathogens were gram-negative bacteria (64%), followed by gram-positive bacteria (25%) and fungi (8%). the predominant gram-negative bacteria were haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and enterococcus faecalis essentially represented the gram-positive bacteria. no multiresistant bacteria were observed. bacteria were susceptible to most of the antibiotics classically administered for their treatment. conclusions: the predominant site of infection in patients with lung cancer is the tracheobronchial tree, with s pneumoniae, s aureus, h influenzae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and m catarrhalis as the principal pathogens.

TI  == bacterial translocation after cirrhotic liver resection: a clinical investigation of 181 patients.
AB  == background: cirrhotic patients are usually associated with a high susceptibility  to infection. although bacterial translocation from gut mucosa to mesenteric lymph node (mln) and systemic circulation is a well-known phenomenon after hepatectomy, its role in cirrhotic patients remains unclear. materials and methods: mln was harvested for bacterial culture before and after liver resection in 181 cirrhotic patients. the characteristics and postoperative courses of patients with positive and negative bacterial culture for mln after hepatectomy were compared. postoperative systemic antibiotics were administered if infectious complications occurred. results: no bacteria were cultured in mln before hepatectomy. bacterial translocation (bt) to mln after hepatectomy occurred in 36 patients (bt group). after multivariate analysis, intraoperative blood transfusion was the only independent factor that influenced bacterial translocation rates after cirrhotic liver resection. bt group patients also had higher infectious and overall complication rates, with a longer postoperative hospital stay. among the cultured bacteriae from infected sites in bt group patients with infectious complications, only 2 patients (12.5%) had totally different bacterial species to those cultured from mlns. conclusions: bacterial translocation more often occurred after liver resection in cirrhotic patients who received intraoperative blood transfusion. such patients had higher postoperative infectious and overall complication rates. thus, avoidance of intraoperative blood transfusion is mandatory for cirrhotic liver resection.

TI  == the influence of inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment on patients with bloodstream infections in an intensive care unit.
AB  == objective: to determine the occurrence of inadequate antimicrobial therapy among  critically ill patients with bacteremia and the factors associated with it, to identify the microorganisms that received inadequate antimicrobial treatment, and to determine the relationship between inadequate treatment and patients outcome.  methods: from june 1995 to january 1999 we collected data on all clinically significant icu-bacteremias in our teaching hospital. clinical and microbiological characteristics were recorded and the adequacy of empirical antimicrobial treatment in each case was determined. we defined inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment as applying to infection that was not being effectively treated at the time the causative microorganism and its antibiotic susceptibility were known. multivariate analysis was used to determine the variables associated with inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment and to  evaluate the influence of this on the related mortality to bacteremia, using the  spss package (9.0). results: among 166 intensive care unit patients with bacteremia, 39 (23.5%) received inadequate antimicrobial treatment. in this last  group the mean age of patients was 64.1 +/- 13.2 years, and 64% were men. bacteremia was hospital-acquired in 92% of these cases. eleven percent developed  septic shock and 37.7% severe sepsis, and ultimately fatal underlying disease was present in 28.2% of patients given inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment.  the main sources of bacteremias in this group were: a vascular catheter (15.3%),  respiratory (7.6%) or unknown (53.8%). the microorganisms most frequently isolated in the group with inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (29.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (27.3%), enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and candida species (4.5% each). the frequency of coagulase-negative staphylococci in the cases with inappropriate treatment was higher than in the group with appropriate treatment (or 2.62; 95% ci: 1.10-6.21;  p = 0.015). the global mortality rate was 56% and the related mortality was 30% in the group with inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment. the only factor associated with inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment was the absence of abdominal or respiratory focus (p = 0.04; or = 0.35; 95% ci: 0.12-0.97). septic shock was related to attributable mortality (p = 0.03; or = 3.19; 95% ci: 1.08-9.40), but not inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment (p = 0.24; or =  1.71; 95% ci: 0.66-4.78). conclusion: almost a quarter of critically ill patients with bloodstream infections were given inadequate empirical antibiotic treatment, but mortality was not higher in the group with inadequate treatment than in the group with adequate treatment. this fact was probably due to microbiological factors and clinical features, such as the type of microorganism most frequently  isolated and the source of the bacteremia.

TI  == in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against bacteria from hospitalised patients in the british isles.
AB  == piperacillin/tazobactam is used for empirical therapy of severe and complex infections. we assessed its activity, 9 years after launch, against consecutive,  clinically significant isolates from in-patients in uk and ireland. standardised  disc susceptibility tests were performed on 5031 isolates at 28 hospitals. for quality assurance purposes, 5% of these isolates were collected centrally for mic tests, as were those with exceptional resistances. compared with a similar pre-launch survey in 1991, there were major increases in the proportions of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, beta-haemolytic streptococci and enterococcus faecium isolates collected, balanced by decreases in escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and coagulase-negative staphylococci. these changes in species prevalence mostly favoured organisms with inherent resistance(s) or-in the case of s. aureus-reflected the massive increase of mrsa, up from 0.7% of all isolates in 1991 to 14.8% in 2001. based on the disc tests, piperacillin/tazobactam retained activity against 87% of enterobacteriaceae isolates, 95% of p. aeruginosa, 99% of streptococci and 96% of enterococcus faecalis. resistance nevertheless had increased since 1991 in e. coli from 4 to 10%, klebsiella spp. (5 to 21%) and in ampc-inducible enterobacteriaceae (17 to 23%), though not in p. mirabilis or p. aeruginosa. mic tests confirmed most of the piperacillin/tazobactam resistance found by disc tests in enterobacter spp.,  but indicated susceptibility for about half of the e. coli isolates recorded as resistant in disc tests. this situation might be remedied by reducing the zone breakpoint, but this would increase the "false susceptible" rate unacceptably. thus, if disc tests suggest that an isolate is marginally resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam and the drug is sought as therapy, it is recommended that mic be determined with, e.g., an etest.

TI  == comparative studies on the activity of basil--an essential oil from ocimum basilicum l.--against multidrug resistant clinical isolates of the genera staphylococcus, enterococcus and pseudomonas by using different test methods.
AB  == the essential oil basil is obtained from the aerial parts of ocimum basilicum l.  after gas chromatographic separation, the following components were identified: linalol (54.95%), methylchavikol (11.98%), methylcinnamat (7.24%) and linolen (0.14%). the activity of basil against multidrug resistant clinical isolates from the genera staphylococcus, enterococcus and pseudomonas has been studied. for this purpose, standard and modified broth macrodilution methods were used and time kill kinetic of basil was studied. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were reported between 0.0030% and 0.0007% (v/v). these concentrations were compared with the inhibitory concentrations (ics) and the logs of the bacterial counts reduction both obtained by basil diluted in 1% tween (tw) 80, saline test  solution (sts) and spiritus vini (sv) 95 degrees instead in a broth. the data, obtained after application of different methods of investigation and validated with membrane filtration, showed a strong inhibitory effect of basil on the test  bacteria. the chosen bacteria are widespread and pose serious therapeutic difficulties because of their high level of resistance. for this reason, the results obtained were considered encouraging.

TI  == epidural catheter colonization is not associated with infection.
AB  == background: epidural anesthesia is one of the most common types of regional anesthesia. although retrospective reviews suggest that the incidence of infection from short-term epidural catheter use is exceedingly low in patients undergoing surgery, the correlation between epidural catheter cultures and infection has not been well defined. the purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of bacterial colonization of epidural catheters in adult patients undergoing surgery under epidural anesthesia, as well as the correlation between  epidural catheter cultures and infection. methods: a prospective nonrandomized study was conducted over a period of 28 months. the incidence of bacterial contamination after epidural catheterization and the correlation between epidural catheter cultures and infection was investigated for 245 adult asa i, ii patients undergoing surgery under lumbar epidural anesthesia. catheters were removed when  epidural analgesia was no longer required, or if clinical signs of infection or catheter malfunction were present. all epidural catheters were cultured upon withdrawal. results: epidural catheters were kept in place for 2.3 +/- 0.2 days (range 0.1-12 days). bacteriological analysis of the 245 epidural catheters yielded 28% positive cultures. the most prevalent microorganism was staphylococcus epidermidis (58%). in obstetric operations a frequency of 32% positive cultures was observed. neither central nervous system nor systemic infections occurred during the study. no correlations were found among the type of surgery, the type of antibiotic administration, the sex or age of the patients, the duration of catheter placement, the maximum body temperature, and the frequency of positive epidural catheter cultures. there was no correlation between epidural catheter colonization and infection. conclusion: the contamination of epidural catheters was found to be independent of the administered antimicrobial agents prior to surgery, the duration of catheter placement, and the presence of fever. except for perioperative prophylaxis, therapeutic use of antibiotics for short-term epidural catheters is not recommended.

TI  == comparison of waterless hand antisepsis agents at short application times: raising the flag of concern.
AB  == objective: although alcohol-based hand rinses and gels have recommended application times of 30 to 60 seconds, healthcare workers usually take much less  time for hand hygiene. we compared the efficacies of four alcohol-based hand rubs produced in europe (hand rinses a, b, and c and one gel formulation) with the efficacy of the european norm 1500 (en 1500) reference waterless hand antisepsis  agent (60% 2-propanol) at short application times. design: comparative crossover  study. setting: infection control program laboratory of a large tertiary-care teaching hospital. participants: twelve healthy volunteers. intervention: measurement of residual bacterial counts and log reduction factors following inoculation of fingertips with staphylococcus aurens american type culture collection (atcc) 6538, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 15442, and a clinical isolate of enterococcus faecalis. results: all hand rinses satisfied en 1500 standards following a single application for 15 and 30 seconds, but reduction factors for the gel formulation were significantly lower for all tested organisms (all p < .025). conclusions: under stringent conditions similar to clinical practice, all  three hand rinses proved to be more efficacious than the marketed alcohol-based gel in reducing bacterial counts on hands. further studies are necessary to determine the in vivo efficacy of alcohol-based gels and whether they are as efficacious as alcohol-based rinses in reducing the transmission of nosocomial infections.

TI  == crystal structure of enterococcus faecalis slya-like transcriptional factor.
AB  == the crystal structure of a slya transcriptional regulator at 1.6 a resolution is  presented, and structural relationships between members of the marr/slya family are discussed. the slya family, which includes slya, rap, hor, and rova proteins, is widely distributed in bacterial and archaeal genomes. current evidence suggests that slya-like factors act as repressors, activators, and modulators of  gene transcription. these proteins have been shown to up-regulate the expression  of molecular chaperones, acid-resistance proteins, and cytolysin, and down-regulate several biosynthetic enzymes. the structure of slya from enterococcus faecalis, determined as a part of an ongoing structural genomics initiative (www.mcsg.anl.gov), revealed the same winged helix dna-binding motif that was recently found in the marr repressor from escherichia coli and the mexr  repressor from pseudomonas aeruginosa, a sequence homologue of marr. phylogenetic analysis of the marr/slya family suggests that sly is placed between the slya and marr subfamilies and shows significant sequence similarity to members of both subfamilies.

TI  == the significance of sunlight for the elimination of indicator bacteria in small-scale bathing ponds in central europe.
AB  == in order to determine the impact of sunlight on the reduction rate of indicator bacteria, bathing waters of different turbidity were artificially contaminated with indicator bacteria and exposed to sunlight. the reduction rates determined for the indicator bacteria showed a significant correlation with radiation intensity and, thus, also the time of day as well as the turbidity of the water.  under conditions of strong radiation intensity and low water turbidity (< 5 ftu), indicator bacteria were eliminated within 1-2 h of contamination with an initial  concentration of 10(5) cfu/ml. moreover, differences between different indicator  bacteria were found. enterococcus faecalis proved to be significantly more resistant to sunlight than the other indicator bacteria tested (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus). the results of the present study, namely the complete elimination of indicator bacteria within a few hours, showed  that sunlight, given an appropriate intensity and good water transparency, was the most important factor in the reduction of hygienically-relevant microorganisms in surface waters and, thus, also in small-scale bathing ponds.

TI  == a uk multicentre study of the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial pathogens causing urinary tract infection.
AB  == objectives: to determine the prevalence of resistance amongst urinary tract pathogens against antimicrobials used to treat urinary tract infections (utis) in the uk to provide data to help direct empirical therapy. method: during 1999-2000, a total of 1291 bacterial isolates causing uti were collected from 8 centres in the uk. isolates were cultured from patients with (1). community-acquired uti in those less than 65 years old (397), (2). hospital-acquired uti other than those admitted with pyelonephritis (394), (3). pyelonephritis (108) and (4). community-acquired uti in those greater than 65 years old (392). after re-identification, mics for a range of antimicrobials were determined and interpreted using nccls procedures and interpretive guidelines. results: escherichia coli was the predominant pathogen in all categories but the  total percentage for each category varied (56.3-77.3%). the next three pathogens  of importance were enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis which varied in prevalence slightly from category to category. the activity of amoxycillin against e. coli (51.3% susceptible) was greatly reduced as a result of beta-lactamase production and only partially restored by the addition of clavulanic acid (78.8% susceptible). cefuroxime was very active against e. coli using parenteral form breakpoints (97.1% susceptible) but less so using oral form breakpoints (68.6% susceptible). cefuroxime was inactive against  enterococcus spp. and pseudomonas spp. nitrofurantoin was very active against isolates of e. coli (96.3% susceptible) and e. faecalis but not against k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis or pseudomonas aeruginosa. overall susceptibility to trimethoprim ranged from 58.1% to 84.5% for the most prevalent pathogens. ciprofloxacin was highly active against the uti pathogens examined in this study  with susceptibilities of between 88.6% and 97.7% for the most prevalent pathogens (e. coli, n=864, 97.7% susceptible) and was the only oral agent tested with activity against pseudomonas spp. conclusion: these data provide much needed information on the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance amongst pathogens currently causing uti in the uk.

TI  == [comparative studies on activities on antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2000). iii. secular changes in susceptibility].
AB  == the bacteria (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa) isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 10 institutions in japan were supplied  between august 2000 and july 2001. then, the susceptibilities of these bacteria to various antimicrobial agents were examined, and the results were compared with those obtained between 1992 and 1999. comparison was made by classifying strains  isolated from patients into those in uncomplicated utis and those in complicated  utis (including with or without indwelling catheter). e. faecalis showed good susceptibility to ampicillin (abpc) and imipenem (ipm), and the mic90s were 2 micrograms/ml. also, e. faecalis showed good susceptibility to vancomycin (vcm).  however, the mic90, which was 2 micrograms/ml between 1992 and 1999, rose to 4 micrograms/ml in patients with complicated utis because the strains inhibited at  4 micrograms/ml increased more than before. the low susceptibility of s. aureus to arbekacin (abk) in complicated utis, as shown in 1998 and 1999, recovered in 2000, and no strains inhibited at > or = 4 micrograms/ml were detected. e. coli showed good susceptibility to ctm (mic90: 0.25-0.5 microgram/ml) and czop (mic90: < or = 0.125 microgram/ml) and was not resistant to those. e. coli also showed good susceptibility to the other drugs except to penicillins. decreases in susceptibility of e. coli to quinolones, ciprofloxacin (cpfx), and sparfloxacin (spfx) were observed in the patients with complicated utis. the susceptibility of klebsiella spp. to all drugs did not significantly change in 2000 and was generally good except to penicillins. although the susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to carbapenems was notable, the mic90 went up from 4 micrograms/ml to  16 micrograms/ml in complicated utis compared with those observed in the previous year.

TI  == evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  == the newly developed rapid lumi eiken/is60 (rl/is60) system automatically determines mics by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. the present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility  testing. chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with mics determined by the reference microdilution method. when the mics of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (qc) strains (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the rl/is60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the qc limits  proposed by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the system  was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including e. coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, p. aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae. overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the rl/is60 system and the reference microdilution method. our  results suggest that the rl/is60 system provides rapid and reliable mics of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as qc strains.

AB  == the in vitro spectrum of a novel des-fluoro (6) quinolone, garenoxacin (bms-284756), was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and trovafloxacin against 736 clinical isolates from cancer patients. garenoxacin was the most active agent overall against gram-positive organisms, with potent activity against aerococcus spp., micrococcus spp., rhodococcus equi, stomatococcus mucilaginous, bacillus spp., enterococcus faecalis, listeria monocytogenes, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus spp., and all beta-hemolytic and viridans streptococci. although ciprofloxacin was the most active agent tested against the enterobacteriaceae garenoxacin inhibited the majority of these isolates at <or=4.0 microg/ml, its proposed susceptibility break-point. all 4 agents had sub-optimal activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and variable activity against other non-fermenters, with stenotrophomonas maltophila and alcaligenes spp. being the most resistant isolates. the overall broad spectrum of garenoxacin warrants its evaluation for the prevention or treatment of infections in cancer patients.

TI  == sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  == aims: to test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. methods: the bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 iu/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin b was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees c with five inocula of 14 bacteria. two yeasts  (candida spp) and one aspergillus were also tested. contaminated media were then  inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened  daily by visual inspection. the sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. results: organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria  irrespective of the starting inoculums: streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, and haemophilus influenzae. for micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal  only (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, candida kruzei, aspergillus  fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (sd 13.8, range 2-52). in cases of detection by the  blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. conclusions: blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.

TI  == total synthesis and biological evaluation of (5z,9z)-5,9-hexadecadienoic acid, an inhibitor of human topoisomerase i.
AB  == the naturally occurring (5z,9z)-5,9-hexadecadienoic acid was synthesized stereochemically pure in six steps starting with commercially available 1,5-hexadiyne. the title compound was antimicrobial against the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus (mic 80 microm) and streptococcus faecalis (mic 200 microm), but inactive against gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa. in addition, the (5z,9z)-5,9-hexadecadienoic acid completely inhibits human topoisomerase i at a concentration of 800 microm, while 5,9-hexadecadiynoic acid and hexadecanoic acid do not inhibit topoisomerase i (>1000 microm). this comparison reveals that the cis double bond geometry in the title compound is required for topoisomerase i inhibition. moreover, these results suggest that the antimicrobial activity of (5z,9z)-5,9-hexadecadienoic acid against either s. aureus or s. faecalis could be a result, at least in part, of the inhibitory activity of the acid against topoisomerases.

TI  == innate immune responses of human neonatal cells to bacteria from the normal gastrointestinal flora.
AB  == the hygiene hypothesis postulates that the prevalence of allergy has increased due to decreased microbial stimulation early in life, leading to delayed maturation of the immune system. the aim of this study was to examine the cytokine pattern produced from cord blood mononuclear cells relative to adult cells after stimulation with bacterial strains from the normal flora. mononuclear cells from cord and adult blood samples were stimulated with the following bacteria: bifidobacterium adolescentis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus mitis, corynebacterium minutissimum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides vulgatus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, veillonella parvula, and neisseria sicca. the levels of interleukin 12 (il-12), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-10, and il-6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the tnf-alpha production was also analyzed after blocking cd14, toll-like receptor 2 (tlr-2), and tlr-4 prior to stimulation with bacteria. the levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha were similar in cord and adult cells. gram-positive bacteria induced considerably higher levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha than gram-negative bacteria in both cord and adult cells. the levels of il-6 were significantly higher in newborns than in adults, whereas the levels of  il-10 were similar in newborns and adults. gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria induced similar levels of il-6 and il-10 in cord cells. l. plantarum bound or signaled through cd14, tlr-2, and tlr-4, whereas e. coli acted mainly through cd14 and tlr-4. these results indicate that the innate immune response in newborns to commensal bacteria is strong and also suggest that different bacterial strains may have differential effects on the maturation of the immune system of infants.

AB  == in order to elucidate trends in the incidence and susceptibility profiles of causative agents of bacteremia/fungemia in nine surgical intensive care units, a  total of 744 isolates obtained during a 5-year period (1996-2000) were studied. the isolates included 698 bacteria and 46 fungi obtained from 523 positive blood  cultures, representing 317 episodes of bacteremia/fungemia. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus accounted for 2.3 episodes per 1000 surgical icu admissions in 1996, 1.6 in 1997, 0.3 in 1998, 0.6 in 1999, and 1.7 in 2000. one enterococcus faecalis (vana) isolate resistant to both vancomycin and teicoplanin was recovered in 1996. ciprofloxacin resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased from 36% in 1996 to 20% in 2000, and resistance to third-generation cephalosporins decreased from 40% in 1996 to 9% in 2000. in light of differences  between these results and those found elsewhere, these findings might prove useful for making infection control policy decisions in intensive care units.

TI  == immune up-regulation and tumor apoptosis by androstene steroids.
AB  == beta androstenes steroid up-regulates immunity to increase resistance against lethal infection and lethal radiation, and mediates a rapid recovery of hematopoietic precursor cells after radiation injury. beta androstenetriol increases the levels of the th(1) cytokines, il-2, il-3, ifn gamma and counteracts hydrocortisone mediated immune suppression. in contrast, 17 alpha androstenediol inhibits proliferation and mediates apoptosis in tumor cells of murine and human origin. its epimer 17beta androstenediol does not. the antiproliferative functions of 17 alpha androstenediol are not dependent on either the estrogen or androgen receptors. our findings show that beta androstenes and analogs protect the host from lethal infection by dna or rna viruses such as, herpesvirus type 2, coxsackievirus b4, influenza, and arthropod  borne viruses. these androstenes also protected the host from lethal bacterial infections by enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumonia and from parasites infections, i.e. cryptosporidium parvum, and malaria. in vivo, the level of potency follows the order: dehydroepiandrosterone<<<androstenediol<androstenetriol with the latter being up  to one hundred thousand times more potent in protecting the host from infections  than the first. in vitro, their effects are also dramatically different from one  another with only beta androstenetriol potentiating the cellular response by increasing lymphocyte activation and counteracting hydrocortisone immune-suppressive activity. conceptually, the androstenes form a new and different subclass of steroid hormones with unique physiological properties. following host injury, the balance between the epimers and isomers is a determining factor in the overall regulation of hematopoiesis, th(l)/th(2) balance, and host resistance to infections and tumor growth.

TI  == proteinases of common pathogenic bacteria degrade and inactivate the antibacterial peptide ll-37.
AB  == effectors of the innate immune system, the anti-bacterial peptides, have pivotal  roles in preventing infection at epithelial surfaces. here we show that proteinases of the significant human pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis and streptococcus pyogenes, degrade the  antibacterial peptide ll-37. analysis by mass spectrometry of fragments generated by p. aeruginosa elastase in vitro revealed that the initial cleavages occurred at asn-leu and asp-phe, followed by two breaks at arg-ile, thus inactivating the  peptide. proteinases of the other pathogens also degraded ll-37 as determined by  sds-page. ex vivo, p. aeruginosa elastase induced ll-37 degradation in human wound fluid, leading to enhanced bacterial survival. the degradation was blocked  by the metalloproteinase inhibitors gm6001 and 1, 10-phenantroline (both of which inhibited p. aeruginosa elastase, p. mirabilis proteinase, and e. faecalis gelatinase), or the inhibitor e64 (which inhibited s. pyogenes cysteine proteinase). additional experiments demonstrated that dermatan sulphate and disaccharides of the structure [deltaua(2s)-galnac(4,6s)], or sucroseoctasulphate, inhibited the degradation of ll-37. the results indicate that proteolytic degradation of ll-37 is a common virulence mechanism and that molecules which block this degradation could have therapeutic potential.

AB  == background: retinoids such as retinoic acid (ra), retinol (rol) and retinaldehyde (ral) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. aim: to analyse the potential anti-infective  activities of topical rol, ral and ra. methods: microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of rol, ral and ra were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus flavus, propionibacterium acnes, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus hominis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant s. aureus, methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, streptococcus group b, enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and pseudomonas/klebsiella. in two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% ral or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% ral or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. results: of the three retinoids tested, only ral showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like s. aeureus, micrococcus spp. or  p. acnes. no activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. these results on  reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. mic(50) and mic(90) values for ral were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant s. aureus. the two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with ral had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. in the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2)  for p. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. no resistant bacteria were  found after 2 weeks of topical use. preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of ral is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. conclusion: we have shown that ral differs from parent natural retinoids such as rol and ra in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. this activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the  potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.

TI  == evaluation of the antimicrobial potential of medicinal plants from the ivory coast.
AB  == a total of 148 crude ethanol extracts from 115 plant species were tested in vitro against gram-negative strains (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa) and the  gram-positive staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, they were submitted to antifungal assays against candida albicans and cladosporium cucumerinum, a human and a plant pathogenic microorganism, respectively, known to be good indicators of antifungal activity. no activity was detected against the gram-negative bacteria, while 14.8% and 10.8% of the extracts showed gram-positive bactericidal or bacteriostatic effects on s. aureus and e. faecalis, respectively. an antifungal activity was observed with 15 extracts (10.1%). two species were particularly active against the fungi: dioscorea minutiflora and erythrina vogelii. the young tubers of d. minutiflora contain metabolites with a specific effect on fungi and were not active against the bacteria. on the other hand, e. vogelii was highly effective against the gram-positive bacteria and the fungi.

TI  == vaginal microbiota in healthy pregnant women and prenatal screening of group b streptococci (gbs).
AB  == the microbiota of the lower female genital tract was evaluated from vaginal swabs obtained from 623 healthy pregnant women at gestation periods of 35-40 weeks. isolated and identified microorganisms were expressed as percentages of total samples. as expected, lactobacilli made up the dominant vaginal microbiota (70%). enterobacteriaceae, mainly escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. and proteus, were present in 38% of the samples, which might reflect the possible contamination of  vaginal tract with rectal microorganisms. candida albicans was present in 10% of  healthy pregnant woman assayed. streptoccocci (streptococcus sp. and enterococcus faecalis with 3% and 4%, respectively) and other gram-positive cocci (staphylococcus sp., 5%), along with other microorgansisms such as gardnerella vaginalis (5%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (2%) may represent a potential infection risk. streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococci beta-hemolytic, gbs) was detected in 7% of the samples. gbs infection is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality in the developed world. furthermore, gbs was often co-isolated with c. albicans (54.5%) in the samples. a complete and detailed evaluation of the vaginal biota swab, with particular attention to the presence of potential pathogens such as gbs, is a preventive strategy that can provide useful information to obstetricians and gynecologist in managing the last days of pregnancy and delivery.

TI  == microbiology of acute otitis externa.
AB  == objective: to isolate and characterize bacteria and fungi from acute otitis externa (aoe) and to obtain susceptibility profiles on each bacterial isolate. study design: prospective core series. methods: specimens were collected from the external canals of subjects with clinically diagnosed acute otitis externa. species-level identification for each bacterial isolate recovered was obtained by combining phenotypic and genotypic data. end point mean inhibitory concentration  (mic) testing was performed using national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) recommended methods. results: in alcon-sponsored clinical studies conducted in 1998 to 2000, microbiology specimens were collected from 2039 subjects (2240 diseased ears) by 101 investigators throughout the united states. a total of 2838 bacteria, 32 yeast, and 17 molds were recovered from 2048 ears clinically diagnosed as acute otitis externa. of the 202 bacterial species recovered, the species most frequently isolated was pseudomonas aeruginosa (38%). the next 10 species most frequently isolated were: staphylococcus epidermidis, 9.1%; staphylococcus aureus, 7.8%; microbacterium otitidis, 6.6%; microbacterium  alconae, 2.9%; staphylococcus caprae, 2.6%; staphylococcus auricularis, 2.0%; enterococcus faecalis, 1.9%; enterobacter cloacae, 1.6%; staphylococcus capitis subsp. ureolyticus,1.4%; and staphylococcus haemolyticus, 1.3%. susceptibility profiles of s. epidermidis isolates revealed the greatest frequency of high-level resistance to selected antibiotics (>/=8 microg/ml): 23%, neomycin-resistant; 11%, oxacillin-resistant; and 12%, ofloxacin-resistant. susceptibility profiles of s. aureus isolates revealed a lower frequency of high-level resistance: 6.3%,  neomycin-resistant; 2.7%, oxacillin-resistant; and 4.5%, ofloxacin-resistant. p.  aeruginosa with high-level resistance to quinolones (>/=128 mcg/ml for ofloxacin) was recovered from only 1 subject. likewise, resistance of p. aeruginosa to aminoglycosides was rare. twenty isolates had neomycin mics >/=64 mcg/ml and 10 isolates had gentamicin mics >/=16 mcg/ml. the coryneform isolates identified as  microbacterium otitidis had an intrinsic lack of susceptibility to quinolones (ofloxacin mics >/=16 mcg/ml) and aminoglycosides (tobramycin mics >/=32 mcg/ml and gentamicin mics >/=8 mcg/ml). conclusions: bacterial infections of the external ear canal are most often caused by p. aeruginosa. however, there are a great number of other gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial species that are  recovered from patients with acute otitis externa. because of this diverse etiology, the best topical therapeutic choice for topical therapy is for the most potent, broad-spectrum (especially anti-p. aeruginosa) antibiotic available.

TI  == influence of mucin on the activity of the antiseptic lavasept against staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == background: lavasept, containing the polymeric biguanide polyhexanide, may be effective against staphylococcus aureus colonizing the nasal mucosa. to obtain basic data on its suitability for that purpose, its antimicrobial activity was examined in the presence of mucin. methods: a disk diffusion test was applied using mueller-hinton agar, and disks soaked with a therapeutic and a 10-fold higher concentration of lavasept. commercially available mucin preparations from  porcine stomach were added to the test system. reference strains and 20 clinically isolates of s. aureus, and reference strains of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, and candida albicans were tested.  results: supplementation of the test medium with 1% mucin completely abolished the activity of disks loaded with the therapeutically used concentration of the antiseptic. the neutralizing effect of mucin occurred with all test strains. conclusions: the inactivation of lavasept by mucin may hamper a reliable clearance of nasal s. aureus carriage.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of imipenem against isolates from complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  == antimicrobial activity of imipenem was measured using 4725 strains isolated from  patients with complicated urinary tract infections (cutis) between 1988 and 2000. imipenem was inactive against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecium and some non-fermenting gram-negative rods. resistant strains (mic>16 mg/l) were observed in staphylococcus haemolyticus (22%), enterococcus faecalis (4%), enterococcus avium (8%), serratia marcescens (5%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%). although the prevalence of imipenem-resistant strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and p. aeruginosa was sporadically high in some years, no steady increase was seen over  the period. resistant strains were rare in other major uropathogenic species. these results suggest that imipenem is still one of the most reliable antimicrobial drugs.

TI  == remarkable substituent effects on antimicrobial activities of 1,3-diorganylimidazolidinium salts.
AB  == in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities of a series of 25 diazolidinium  salts, 1,3-diorganylimidazolidinium (1), together with 1,3-dialkylpyrimidinium (2), were evaluated against standard strains: escherichia coli (atcc 25922), staphylococcus epidermidis (atcc 12228), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212), enterobacter cloacae (atcc 13047), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853) and candida albicans (atcc 10239). selective  and effective antibacterial activity against one gram-negative (p. aeruginosa) and two gram-positive (e. faecalis and s. aureus) bacteria were found in salts 1a, 1i and 1j, in contrast to modest to poor activity observed in the rest of the salts. the enhanced antibacterial activity is clearly linked to the introduction  of two bulky mesityl or mesitylbenzyl substituents on the nitrogen atoms of the imidazoline skeleton, while the side chain of the backbone of the molecule has no influence.

TI  == bacterial enteropathogens and factors associated with seasonal episodes of gastroenteritis in nsukka, nigeria.
AB  == each year, between april and october, many children of school age and some young  adults in nsukka, nigeria suffer from gastroenteritis. the period covers the rainy season in this part of africa, when manured farmland occasionally is flooded. in view of the number of people suffering diarrhoea and occasionally low-grade fever, it became necessary to investigate the nature of the bacterial agents responsible. between april and october (1996-1998), 500 loose or watery stools were collected from patients, the ages of which ranged from one month to 31 years. stools that contained parasites were excluded from the study. samples were cultured on 5% blood agar and 1% egg-yolk agar (both containing 10 microg/ml ampicillin), macconkey agar, shigella salmonella agar and in alkaline peptone water. bacterial growths were identified using standard bacteriological procedures. drinking water and some fruit and vegetables prevalent during this period of the year also were cultured. of the 500 stool samples tested, 138 (27.6%) grew a range of organisms including aeromonas hydrophila (65 [13%]), salmonella spp. (55 [11%]), shigella spp. (9 [1.8%]) and enteropathogenic escherichia coli (9 [1.8%]). drinking water and some vegetables grew pseudomonas  aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, respectively. the highest isolation rate occurred during june and july, corresponding to the period of greatest flooding of arable land. although no enteropathogens were isolated from the fruit and vegetables examined, they contained e. faecalis--an organism found in faeces. our findings failed to explain why 72% of the samples grew no bacterial enteropathogens.

TI  == polymerase chain reaction as a sensitive and rapid method for specific detection  of mycoplasma pneumoniae in clinical samples.
AB  == the fast diagnosis of mycoplasma primary atypical pneumonia is impaired by the lack of routinely available culture methods for isolation of mycoplasma pneumoniae from clinical specimens. likewise, serological methods commonly used for diagnosis are insensitive and non-specific. in this study, we have established and applied the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technique to detect m. pneumoniae dna in clinical samples originating from the respiratory tract. the pcr results were compared with those from culture and serology tests. to standardize the detection of m. pneumoniae by pcr, we first used dna from culture grown organisms and clinical samples seeded with m. pneumoniae. pcr amplification was performed with m. pneumoniae-specific primers to amplify 144, 153 and 631 bp  dna fragments by using primer pairs mp5-1/mp5-2, p1-178/p1-331 and p1-178/p1-809, respectively. the amplification of the 631 bp dna fragment was found to be most sensitive for the detection of m. pneumoniae. using the most sensitive pcr, a total of 47 respiratory specimens from patients suspected of community acquired pneumonia were tested. while none of the specimens were positive for m. pneumoniae in culture, 6 specimens gave positive results by pcr. in 4 out of the  5 pcr positive samples tested serologically, the results were supported by elevated levels of anti-mycoplasma igg/igm/iga. thus, these results suggest that  pcr is the most sensitive method to detect m. pneumoniae in clinical specimens.

TI  == antibody reactivity of a standardized human serum protein solution against a spectrum of microbial pathogens and toxins: comparison with fresh frozen plasma.
AB  == in this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (hsp) and fresh frozen plasma (ffp) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. due to the clinical use of hsp and ffp for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that hsp contains marked igg antibody reactivity against antigens of escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter sakazakii, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, chlamydia pneumoniae, and candida albicans. although no igm antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in hsp, moderate iga reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. immunoblot analysis  demonstrated specific iga and igg responses against the endoproteinase glu-c and  the superantigens enterotoxin a and b of s. aureus, the iga-protease of neisseria gonorrhoeae, and shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic e. coli. by using 3 different hsp batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. this antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of ffp.

TI  == investigating the bacterial barrier properties of four contemporary wound dressings.
AB  == the ability of four wound dressings (combiderm, allevyn hydrocellular, tegaderm and tielle) to resist penetration of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa was investigated in vitro using a dedicated test apparatus. with the exception of tielle, each dressing prevented bacterial transmission over an 11-day challenge period. when both the wound contact surface and the external surface of tielle were directly challenged with a bacterial suspension, penetration of the dressing was observed within three to five days. the breakdown of its outer membrane could explain the inability of tielle to maintain a barrier to the passage of the test  bacteria used in this wound model. on the basis of these data, combiderm, allevyn hydrocellular and tegaderm dressings may facilitate infection control by acting as a physical barrier to the transmission of potentially pathogenic and antibiotic-resistant wound bacteria. however, further research is urgently required to determine whether or not the same results are observed in clinical practice.

TI  == in vitro action of carboxyfullerene.
AB  == fullerene compounds have avid reactivity with free radicals and are regarded as 'radical sponges'. the trimalonic acid derivative of fullerene is one of the water-soluble compounds that has been synthesized and found to be an effective antioxidant both in vivo and in vitro. carboxyfullerene has been shown to be effective in the treatment of both gram-positive and -negative infections, although its mode of action is poorly understood. we determined the mic and minimal bactericidal concentration of carboxyfullerene for 20 isolates, including staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi and klebsiella pneumoniae. we further investigated the action of carboxyfullerene using transmission electron microscopy (tem), anticarboxyfullerene antibody binding assay and a membrane perturbation assay. all gram-positive species were inhibited by < or = 50 mg/l of carboxyfullerene, whereas gram-negative species were not inhibited, even at 500 mg/l carboxyfullerene. bactericidal activity was demonstrated only for gram-positive species, particularly for streptococcus pyogenes a-20, which was killed rapidly. intercalation of carboxyfullerene into the cell wall of staphylococci and streptococci was demonstrated by tem and anti-carboxyfullerene  binding assay. damage to the cell membrane in gram-positive, but not gram-negative, bacteria was confirmed by the membrane perturbation assay. these findings indicate that the action of carboxyfullerene on gram-positive bacteria is achieved by insertion into the cell wall and destruction of membrane integrity.

TI  == the migration of proteus mirabilis and other urinary tract pathogens over foley catheters.
AB  == objective: to examine the ability of organisms that infect the catheterized urinary tract to migrate over the surfaces of foley catheters. materials and methods: in a simple laboratory model, organisms were challenged to migrate across sections of hydrogel-coated latex, hydrogel/silver-coated latex, silicone-coated latex and all-silicone catheters. the sections (1 cm long) were placed as bridges in channels between blocks of agar and the test organisms inoculated onto the agar adjacent to one side of each bridge. the plates were incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h and examined for growth of the test organisms  on the agar on the other side of the bridges. a collection of swarming, swimming  and nonmotile species were tested in the model. the relative mobilities of the test organisms were expressed as migration indices, calculated as the percentage  of tests in which bacterial migration was observed over each type of catheter bridge. results: the swarmer cells of proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris migrated  successfully (migration indices of 73-100) over all four types of catheter. the migration index of serratia marcescens swarmers was reduced to 33 over the silver-coated catheters, but these cells crossed over the other catheter surfaces with ease (indices of 100). pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most mobile of the swimming, non-swarming organisms with indices of 70-22, but this group was less capable of migration than the swarmers. indices were 0-33 for nonmotile organisms. the mean migration indices for the nine species for each type of catheter were 57 (hydrogel-coated latex), 49 (silver/hydrogel-coated latex), 41 (silicone-coated latex) and 35 (all-silicone). the swarmer cells of p. mirabilis  moved through populations of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis, and then migrated over sections  of hydrogel-coated latex catheters with little or no reduction in migration index. they were also capable of transporting the nonmotile cells of k. pneumoniae and s. aureus over the catheters. the migration index of p. mirabilis  swarmers was substantially reduced in the presence of ps. aeruginosa and s. marcescens. conclusions: hydrogel coatings facilitate the migration of urinary tract pathogens over catheter surfaces. with the exception of s. marcescens, the  incorporation of silver into the hydrogel did not inhibit migration. swarmer cells were particularly effective at moving over catheters and p. mirabilis swarmers were also capable of transporting other species. this suggests that inhibitors of swarming could be useful in controlling catheter-associated infection and the complications resulting from the spread of bacterial biofilm over catheters.

AB  == background and aim of the study: prosthetic valve endocarditis (pve) is a relatively uncommon but very serious condition. as bacterial colonization of the  prosthetic heart valve sewing cuff can be a prelude to the clinical occurrence of pve, antimicrobial coating of the sewing cuff may be beneficial. the study aims were to examine the antimicrobial activity in vitro and anti-infective efficacy in vivo of prosthetic heart valve sewing cuffs coated with minocycline and rifampin. methods: zones of inhibition by antimicrobial-coated sewing cuffs were  assessed in vitro against staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. the ability of subcutaneously implanted devices coated with minocycline and rifampin to resist colonization and infection by p. aeruginosa was also examined in a rabbit model.  results: antimicrobial-coated sewing cuffs produced zones of inhibition against all tested organisms. coated devices were significantly less likely than uncoated devices to become colonized (2/24; 8% versus 20/24; 83%; p <0.001) or to cause device-related infection (0/24; 0% versus 18/24; 75%; p <0.001) and device-related abscess (0/24; 0% versus 10/24; 42%; p <0.001) due to p. aeruginosa. conclusion: prosthetic heart valve sewing cuffs coated with minocycline and rifampin provide broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity in vitro,  and are anti-infective in vivo against p. aeruginosa. these results encourage the clinical evaluation of these sewing cuffs.

AB  == the phytoalexin resveratrol is commonly found in food and drinks, including red wine, grapes, and peanuts. many studies have shown that this compound has anti-inflammatory properties, and it has been ascribed as having health benefits  that help to prevent cancer and coronary heart disease. a treatment that combines antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory actions may be desirable for alleviating many skin conditions that range in severity. therefore, we evaluated the antimicrobial activity of resveratrol against bacteria and dermatophytes that are major etiologic agents of human skin infections. using the broth microdilution protocol of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) m7-a5, growth of the bacterial species staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa was inhibited at 171-342 microg/ml of resveratrol in the solvent dimethyl sulfoxide. using the nccls protocol m38-p, activity against the  fungal species trichophyton mentagrophytes, trichophyton tonsurans, trichophyton  rubrum, epidermophyton floccosum, and microsporum gypseum was also tested. the growth of dermatophytes was inhibited at 25-50 microg/ml of resveratrol. thus, this study indicates a novel application for resveratrol, a molecule of plant defense, to combat human fungal pathogens. resveratrol and its analogs may have wide application to skin conditions that afflict a significant portion of our population, and may also have promising clinical potentials in diabetic wounds.

TI  == clinafloxacin versus piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of severe skin and  soft-tissue infections in adults at a veterans affairs medical center.
AB  == background: severe skin and soft-tissue infections (sstis), particularly diabetic foot infections, are a source of considerable morbidity and mortality. inappropriate antimicrobial therapy may contribute to the increasing emergence of bacterial resistance, as well as to increased health care costs. thus, there is a continuing search for reasonably safe, well-tolerated, and effective antimicrobial agents that are less susceptible to the development of resistance than older agents. objective: the department of veterans affairs (va) medical center in nashville, tennessee, was i site in a multicenter, phase iii, randomized, investigator-blinded clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of clinafloxacin with those of piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of adult  patients with ssti. methods: over an 18-month period, patients aged > or = 18 years with physical findings of acute bacterial ssti requiring hospitalization and intravenous antimicrobial therapy were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either clinafloxacin 200 mg iv every 12 hours or piperacillin/tazobactam 3.375 g  iv every 6 hours. after a minimum of 3 days of intravenous therapy, a switch to oral therapy with clinafloxacin 200 mg po every 12 hours or amoxicillin/clavulanate 500 mg po every 8 hours could be made in the respective treatment groups. results: the center enrolled 84 patients (42 in each group), all but i of whom were male, reflecting the typical va medical center population. the mean age was 60 years (range, 36-80 years) in the clinafloxacin group and 65  years (range, 35-87) in the piperacillin/tazobactam group; the latter group was significantly older (p = 0.0482), which could have affected recovery rates. sixty-six patients were white and 18 were black. the mean ( +/- sd) duration of treatment was 10.69 +/- 5.34 days in the clinafloxacin group and 12.07 +/- 5.06 days in the piperacillin/tazobactam group; the mean length of stay was 10.83 +/-  10.28 days and 14.95 +/- 19.20 days, respectively. fifty-three (63%) patients were switched to oral therapy (21 in the clinafloxacin group, 32 in the piperacillin/tazobactam group). the most commonly isolated pathogens were staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter cloacae. clinical cure rates and microbiologic eradication rates were similar between the 2 treatments. the piperacillin/ tazobactam arm experienced more all-cause adverse events than the clinafloxacin arm, although the difference was not statistically significant. the clinafloxacin arm experienced significantly more adverse events (eg, photosensitivity) that were judged by the investigator to be drug related (p = 0.034). conclusions: in this study population of hospitalized adults, clinafloxacin was as effective as piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of complicated sstis. appropriate precautions must be taken against exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet light in patients receiving clinafloxacin, and adequate monitoring is necessary. further investigation is necessary into how the phototoxic effects of the flu oroquinolones can be limited.

TI  == spectrum of ct findings in nosocomial pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate ct findings in nosocomial pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia (pap) and to compare features of pap in patients with isolated p. aeruginosa cultures and those with coexistent infections. a retrospective database search revealed 28 patients with nosocomial pap (12 men, 16 women; mean age, 57 years) in which thoracic ct had been performed within a mean of 1.7 days from the time of respiratory culture. two chest radiologists blinded to culture data performed a consensus reading noting distribution and pattern of consolidation, ground-glass opacity, nodules, peribronchial infiltration, necrosis, effusions, and pleural enhancement. coexistent respiratory cultures were recorded. consolidation was present in all patients, involving multiple lobes in 23 (82%) and demonstrating upper zonal involvement in 23 (82%). nodular features were present in 14 (50%), including tree-in-bud patterns with centrilobular distributions in 9 (64%) and larger, randomly distributed nodules in 5 (36%). five of five patients with consolidations limited to the lower lung zones had associated upper lung nodules. ground-glass opacity was seen in nine (31%) and peribronchial infiltration in 16 (57%). necrosis was present in eight (29%). thirteen (46%) bilateral and five (18%) unilateral pleural effusions were present with enhancement occurring in two (1%). coexistent positive respiratory cultures were identified in 13 patients. the distribution of consolidation, frequency and distribution of nodules, and frequency of necrosis did not differ significantly between patients with and without other positive cultures. with ct, pap most commonly presents with multifocal airspace consolidation. nodular features were identified in half, with one-third demonstrating tree-in-bud opacities. unsuspected necrosis occurred in one-third of cases. ct findings in patients with and without other respiratory isolates did not differ in the distribution and frequency of consolidations, nodularity, or necrosis.

TI  == two methods to evaluate the antimicrobial action of calcium hydroxide paste.
AB  == the objective of this study was to analyze two methods for determining the antimicrobial effectiveness of (i) calcium hydroxide plus saline, (ii) calcium hydroxide plus polyethylene glycol, and (iii) calcium hydroxide plus camphorated  paramonochlorophenol. four microorganisms (staphylococcus aureus (atcc 6538), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853), and bacillus subtilis (atcc 6633)), one yeast (candida albicans (icb/usp-562)), and one mixture of these organisms were used. the strains were inoculated in brain heart infusion (bhi) and incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. two methods, the direct exposure test and the agar diffusion test were used to evaluate antimicrobial effects. for the direct exposure test (det) 288 paper points were contaminated with the standard microbial suspensions and exposed to the intracanal dressings for 1, 24, 48, and 72 h. the points were immersed in letheen broth, followed by incubation at 37 degrees c for 48 h. an inoculum of 0.1 ml obtained from letheen broth was then transferred to 7 ml of bhi under identical incubation conditions, and microbial growth was evaluated. pastes showed activity between 1 and 72 h, depending on the microorganism/mixture tested. for the agar diffusion test 36 petri plates with 20 ml of bhi agar were inoculated with 0.1 ml of the same microbial suspension used for the det, using sterile swabs that were  spread on the medium. five cavities were made in each of two agar plates (total = 10) and completely filled with one of the calcium hydroxide pastes. the plates were preincubated for 1 h at environmental temperature and then incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 to 48 h. the inhibition zone around each well was recorded in millimeters, and the results were submitted to anova and tukey test (alpha = 0.05). all intracanal dressings induced inhibition zones (range 5.0-10.0 mm). data obtained showed that both the det and agar diffusion test are useful in establishing the calcium hydroxide antimicrobial spectrum, thus improving infection control protocols. the direct exposure method is independent of other variables and is a practical laboratory procedure. a complete antimicrobial effect was observed after 48 h on indicator microorganisms, in both tests, irrespective of the calcium hydroxide paste vehicle.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. special references to bacteria isolated between april 1998  and march 1999].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained in fiscal 1998 (from april 1998 to march 1999). the number of cases investigated as objectives was 225 for one year. a total of 429 strains (121 strains from primary infections and 308 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 183 cases (81.3% of total cases). in primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes and escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of gram-positive aerobes and pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. on the whole, among gram-positive aerobes, the isolation rate of enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by staphylococcus aureus with high frequency in isolation from  postoperative infections. among gram-positive anaerobes, peptostreptococcus spp.  and streptococcus spp. were predominantly isolated. among gram-negative aerobes,  e. coli, p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae were frequently isolated. among gram-negative anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates. in primary infections, the percentage of gram-negative aerobes has gradually increased since fiscal 1995 or 1996 with these years as the turning point, while those of gram-positive and gram-negative  anaerobes have gradually declined. in postoperative infections, the percentage of gram-negative anaerobes has increased continuously since the mid-1980s. the percentage of mrsa among s. aureus rose to 89.7%, which was the highest level since the beginning of this study. the susceptibilities of b. fragilis, which did not show apparent changes, were recognized to have decreased against cephems in fiscal 1998. among other bacteria in b. fragilis group, development of resistance to cephems has continued on a long-term basis since the mid-1980s. e. coli and k. pneuminiae have obviously not changed in susceptibilities, however, the susceptibilities of isolated strains in fiscal 1998 against high-generation cephems, oxacephems and monobactams have declined. we found neither vancomycin-resistant nor teicoplanin-resistant strains of s. aureus and enterococcus spp.

TI  == urinary excretion and bactericidal activities of gemifloxacin and ofloxacin after a single oral dose in healthy volunteers.
AB  == in a randomized crossover study, 16 volunteers (8 men, 8 women) received single oral doses of 320 mg of gemifloxacin and 400 mg of ofloxacin on two separate occasions in the fasting state to assess the urinary excretion and urinary bactericidal titers (ubts) at intervals for up to 144 h. ofloxacin showed higher  concentrations in urine compared with those of gemifloxacin. the median (range) cumulative excretion of gemifloxacin was 29.7% (8.4 to 48.7%) of the parent drug  administered, and median (range) cumulative excretion of ofloxacin was 84.3% (46.5 to 95.2%) of the parent drug administered. the ubts, i.e., the highest twofold dilutions (with antibiotic-free urine as the diluent) of urine that were  still bactericidal, were determined for a reference strain and nine uropathogens  for which the mics of gemifloxacin and ofloxacin were as follows: escherichia coli atcc 25922, 0.016 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively; klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.03 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively; proteus mirabilis, 0.125 and 0.125 microg/ml, respectively; escherichia coli, 0.06 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively;  pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; staphylococcus aureus, 0.008 and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively; enterococcus faecalis, 0.06 and 2 microg/ml, respectively; staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; enterococcus faecalis, 0.5 and 32 microg/ml, respectively; and staphylococcus aureus, 2 and 32 microg/ml, respectively. generally, the ubts for  gram-positive uropathogens were higher for gemifloxacin than for ofloxacin and the ubts for gram-negative uropathogens were higher for ofloxacin than for gemifloxacin. according to the ubts, ofloxacin-resistant uropathogens (mics, >or=4 mg/liter) should also be considered gemifloxacin resistant. although clinical trials have shown that gemifloxacin is effective for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, whether an oral dosage of 320 mg of gemifloxacin once daily is also adequate for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections has yet to be confirmed.

TI  == in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. a total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the national taiwan university hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. for many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. some strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum  inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. moxifloxacin was less active against p. aeruginosa, but was more active against s. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. the drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in taiwan.

TI  == herpes simplex virus type 2 modulates the susceptibility of human bladder cells to uropathogenic bacteria.
AB  == the present study analyses the susceptibility of human bladder-derived cells (ht-1376) to the infection by herpes simplex virus type 2 (hsv-2) and chlamydia trachomatis, as well as to the adhesiveness of uropathogenic bacteria. ht-1376 cells were efficiently infected by hsv-2 strain 333, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence staining of viral antigens, titration of cytopathic effect, and visualisation by transmission electron microscopy. this cell model was also prone to c. trachomatis (serovar e, bour strain) replication and to the adherence of clinical uropathogenic isolates of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris and enterococcus faecalis. the pre-infection of ht-1376 cells with hsv-2 caused a tenfold increased adherence of an e. coli strain (u1), isolated from a patient affected by severe haemorrhagic cystitis, whereas in hsv-2 pre-infected cells the number of c. trachomatis inclusion bodies was significantly reduced. our findings indicate that these cells are a suitable in vitro model for studying infection and super-infection of the lower urinary tract by viruses and bacteria.

TI  == [comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1999). i. susceptibility distribution].
AB  == the bacterial strains isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 9 institutions in japan were supplied between the period of  august 1999 to july 2000. then, the susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. the number of them were 499 strains. the  breakdown of these strains was gram-positive bacteria as 31.3% and gram-negative  bacteria as 68.7%. susceptibilities of these bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; vancomycin (vcm), ampicillin (abpc) and imipenem (ipm) showed strong activities against enterococcus faecalis. the increase of low-susceptible  strains which was noticed in the former year showed a slight recovery in this year. vcm showed a strong activity against mrsa preventing growth of all strains  with 1 microgram/ml. in addition, the activity of arbekacin (abk) was also strong with the mic90 of 2 micrograms/ml against mrsa. however, mssa and mrsa showing low susceptibilities were detected in one strain each (mic: 16 micrograms/ml and  32 micrograms/ml, respectively). carbapenems showed high activities against citrobacter freundii and escherichia coli. meropenem (mepm) prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml. quinolone resistant e. coli decreased in this year compared with those in the last year, that percentage was less than 5%. almost all drugs showed strong activities against klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. mepm and carumonam (crmn) prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml. on the other hand, one strain of k. pneumoniae showing resistance to cefaclor (ccl) and one strain of p. mirabilis showing low susceptibility to most of cephems were detected. against pseudomonas aeruginosa,  almost drugs were not so active. the mic90s of carbapenems were 8 micrograms/ml and those of all other drugs were more than 16 micrograms/ml.

TI  == conserved degp protease in gram-positive bacteria is essential for thermal and oxidative tolerance and full virulence in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the degp protease, a multifunctional chaperone and protease, has been shown to be essential for virulence in gram-negative pathogens such as salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, brucella abortus, yersinia enterocolitica, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the function of degp in pathogenesis appears to be the degradation of damaged proteins that accumulate as a result of the initial host response to infection, which includes the release of reactive oxygen intermediates. additionally, the degp protease plays a major role in monitoring and maintaining  the escherichia coli periplasm and influences e. coli pilus biogenesis. we report here the identification of highly homologous enzymes in streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the phenotype of an insertionally inactivated degp allele in s. pyogenes is similar to that reported for e. coli, with temperature sensitivity for growth and enhanced sensitivity to reactive oxygen intermediates. virulence studies in a mouse model of streptococcal infection indicate that a functional degp protease is required for full virulence. these results suggest degp as an attractive broad-spectrum target for future anti-infective drug development.

TI  == dental unit waterlines: review and product evaluation.
AB  == dental practitioners must be knowledgeable regarding microbial contamination and  biofilm formation in dental unit waterlines. education should stress the need for improvement in the quality of water delivered to patients during treatment. manufacturers must also play an important role by providing training and education regarding the proper use and maintenance of their systems. dental facilities, both public and private, need reliable methods to prevent the development of biofilms within duws. these methods must be economical and require minimal effort to use on the part of the dental staff. in order for the system to work efficiently, the effluent water that is produced must be compatible with dental materials and be potentially free from toxic or carcinogenic materials. there are numerous models of water filtration units and chemical flushes available to the dental practitioner. however, the food and drug administration have not approved all products currently on the market. our evaluation of zerosil, a new waterline-cleaning product, indicates that it is very easy to use  and is extremely effective in killing the commonly found microorganisms in dental unit waterlines, as well as eliminating existing biofilms. it is also economical  and requires minimum staff time to keep the waterlines clean. following the initial treatments during week one, the water emanating from the duws was free from any viable microorganisms. this effect was present the entire three weeks in which the waterlines were treated. the elimination of viable microorganisms continued into a fourth study week, even though no further treatment of the duws  was performed. although the manufacturer recommends weekly treatment of duws following the initial treatment regimen, this result indicates that the product has a longer lasting effect than previously thought. finally, the product can be  delivered through any of the commercially available reservoir/bottle water delivery systems. from our study, zerosil appears to meet the demanding requirements of keeping dental unit waterlines clean. based on the research that  has been done thus far, no universal treatment protocol can be recommended. a combination of approaches may offer the best available assurance of high-quality  dental treatment water. independent water reservoir systems, when used with a periodic chemical treatment protocol, have demonstrated safety and efficacy. until we reach a point when a recommendation based on thorough evaluations can be made, dental offices should follow current ada, osap, and cdc guidelines: flush waterlines for two to three minutes at the beginning of each day and for 20 to 30 seconds between each patient, and anti-retraction valves should be installed to prevent oral fluids from being drawn into dental waterlines. it is expected that  in the near future, the dental practitioner will have a choice of proven systems  and products to deal with this issue. until that time, one should carefully evaluate any product or system being considered to prevent the formation of biofilms in duws.

TI  == importance of hand germ contamination in health-care workers as possible carriers of nosocomial infections.
AB  == the importance of hands in the transmission of nosocomial infection has been world wide admitted. however, it is difficult to induce this behavior in health-care workers. the aim of the present work was to point out the importance  of hand bacteria colonization, the influence of hand washing and of patient physical examination. one hundred health-care workers were randomly divided in two groups: group a without hand washing previous to patient physical examination or handling (ppe); group b with hand washing previous to ppe. direct fingerprint  samples in columbia agar before and after ppe were obtained. the colonies were counted and identified by conventional techniques, and antibiograms according to  nccls were performed. before ppe group a participants showed a high number of bacteria regarding group b participants (73.9 vs 20.7; p < 0.001); 44 out of 50 participants were carriers of potentially pathogen bacteria. no group b participants were carriers of potential pathogen bacteria before ppe. the latter  group showed an increase in number of bacteria after ppe (20.7 cfu (before) vs 115.9 cfu (after); p < 0.001). sixteen group b participants were contaminated after ppe with potential pathogens such as s. aureus (50% of them methicillin resistant); escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, half of them multiresistant. we can conclude on the importance of these results to implement educational programs and to provide the health-care workers with the proper commodities to fulfill this practice.

AB  == marula bark is widely used for bacteria-related diseases by indigenous cultures in africa. this study was undertaken to investigate whether the ethnobotanical use can be validated by laboratory studies. bark and leaves were extracted with acetone and mic values were determined using a microplate serial dilution technique with staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis as test organisms. all extracts were active with mic values from 0.15 to 3 mg/ml. based on minimum inhibitory concentration values, inner bark extracts tended to be the most potent followed by outer bark and leaf  extracts, but the differences were not statistically significant. there were two  major bioactive components visible after bioautography of leaf extracts: one strongly polar and the other highly non-polar. the bioactive components could be  separated from 92% of the non-active dry matter by solvent-solvent fractionation  into the carbon tetrachloride, chloroform and n-butanol fractions; these fractions, however, still contained many different compounds. using bark may be detrimental to the plant, but leaf material can also be used for antibacterial application.

TI  == urinary tract infections in general practice in a rural community in south trinidad.
AB  == objective: a prospective study was carried out at a general practice in south trinidad, to assess the sensitivity profiles of urinary isolates in this remote rural community. methods: quantitative bacteriologic cultures were performed according to standard procedures. identification of isolates was based on gram reaction, morphology and biochemical reactions. susceptibility testing was carried out using commonly prescribed antimicrobials for the treatment of urinary tract infections. results: from 779 urine specimens, 49% were culture positive for counts >105 organisms per ml. three hundred and eighteen were aged 21 years and above and 85.5% of these were females. the lowest incidence of urinary tract  infections, 8%, was seen among the 13-20 year old age group. most males above 50  years had indwelling urethral catheters due to prostatic disease. escherichia coli was the predominant isolate, 71%, followed by proteus mirabilis, 9%, and klebsiella pneumoniae, 7%. all urinary tract infections isolates were fully sensitive to ofloxacin and >96% (except for citrobacter species, 63%) were sensitive to cefuroxime. apart from enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus saprophyticus, the overall sensitivity to ampicillin by all isolates was <33%. the prevalence of multi-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa in community-acquired urinary tract infections is increasing. all pseudomonas aeruginosa were fully sensitive to gentamicin and ofloxacin. conclusion: the high frequency of single and multiple antibiotic resistances in this rural community should cause alarm. the ease of procuring antibiotics in these areas without a prescription can result in uncontrolled self-medication. also, the absence of antibiotic prescribing policies and inadequate information on patterns of bacterial resistance, may all contribute to the emergence of resistant strains.

TI  == activity of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against urinary pathogens.
AB  == this study compares the antibacterial activities of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against recently isolated urinary tract pathogens, by evaluating their mics and mbcs in accordance with nccls susceptibility tests, time-kill curves and interference with bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells. a total of 200 clinical isolates was tested, including the species escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia rettgeri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. all e. coli isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin and only one was resistant to ciprofloxacin, and there were no differences between beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains. k. pneumoniae strains resistant to ciprofloxacin were also resistant to levofloxacin. methicillin-resistant s. aureus seemed to be less susceptible than methicillin-susceptible strains to these quinolones. s. epidermidis strains were  susceptible to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, with the exception of two isolates. incubation of s. aureus and e. coli with subinhibitory antimicrobial concentrations reduced their capacity to adhere to uroepithelial cells; this was  statistically significant at 0.25 x mic with respect to controls (p < 0.05). inhibition of adhesion ranged from 36 to 43% when bacteria were incubated in the  presence of 0.25 x mic of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and from 10 to 27% at 0.125 x mic. these findings suggest that levofloxacin is an effective alternative to ciprofloxacin in the treatment of urinary tract infections and that sub-inhibitory concentrations may contribute to efficacy.

TI  == a new hydrogen peroxide--based medical-device detergent with germicidal properties: comparison with enzymatic cleaners.
AB  == background: the objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the cleaning and bacterial killing ability of a new non-enzyme-based formulation (killing detergent solution [kds]) compared with commercially available enzymatic detergents that included metrizyme (metrex research division of sybron canada ltd. morrisburg, ontario) and gzyme (germiphene corp, brantford, ontario). kds is a hydrogen peroxide-based detergent formulation that combines cleaning efficacy with the ability to kill microorganisms. the kds formulation helps ensure the protection of the health care worker from infectious risk during the soaking and  cleaning stages of medical device reprocessing and reduces the bioburden on devices before sterilization/disinfection. methods: test organisms that included  enterococcus faecalis, salmonella choleraesuis, staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were suspended in artificial test soil (ats-b; patent submitted), inoculated at 10(6) colonyforming units per carrier and dried overnight before detergent exposure. the ats-b mimics the blood, protein, carbohydrate, and endotoxin levels of patient-used medical devices. plastic lumen carriers and a flexible colonoscope were used for surface and simulated-use testing, respectively. results: the results for the microbial challenge dried onto polyvinyl chloride (pvc) carriers demonstrated that the ability of kds to remove protein, blood, carbohydrate, and endotoxin from surface test carriers was as effective as the enzyme detergents that were evaluated. furthermore, kds was able to effect approximately a 5-log(10) reduction in microbial loads with a 3-minute exposure at room temperature, whereas none of the other detergents were  as effective. in simulated-use testing of a soiled colonoscope, kds was significantly better at ensuring microbial killing compared with gzyme and metrizyme and was equivalent to the enzymatic detergents in cleaning ability. conclusions: in summary the kds has excellent microbial-killing ability in 3-minute exposures at room temperature and cleans as well as the existing enzymatic detergent formulations that were tested.

AB  == the bacteriological profile in children with culture-positive bacteriuria was analyzed during a 5-year period. escherichia coli was the most common cause of urinary tract infections (57%), followed by streptococcus faecalis (11%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), and proteus mirabilis (6%). results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing indicated that cephalosporins (first, second and third generation) and nitrofurantoin are the best empirical oral treatment for urinary  infections in children. fosfomycin is a valid option in some cases. in hospitalized children treatment must be initiated with a third-generation cephalosporin, and gentamicin can be added in severely ill inpatients. these treatments can be modified when microbiological results become available.

TI  == in vitro activities of ertapenem (mk-0826) against recent clinical bacteria collected in europe and australia.
AB  == ertapenem (mk-0826, l-749,345) is a 1-beta-methyl carbapenem with a long serum half-life. its in vitro activity was determined by broth microdilution against 3,478 bacteria from 12 centers in europe and australia, with imipenem, cefepime,  ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam used as comparators. ertapenem was the most active agent tested against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, with mics at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)s) of < or =1 microg/ml for all species. ertapenem also was more active than imipenem against fastidious gram-negative bacteria and moraxella spp.; on the other hand, ertapenem was slightly less active than imipenem against streptococci, methicillin-susceptible  staphylococci, and anaerobes, but its mic(90)s for these groups remained < or =0.5 microg/ml. acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also much less susceptible to ertapenem than imipenem, and most enterococcus faecalis strains were resistant. ertapenem resistance, based on a provisional nccls mic breakpoint of > or =16 microg/ml, was seen in only 3 of 1,611 strains of the family enterobacteriaceae tested, all of them enterobacter aerogenes. resistance was also seen in 2 of 135 anaerobes, comprising 1 bacteroides fragilis strain and 1 clostridium difficile strain. ertapenem breakpoints for streptococci have not been established, but an unofficial susceptibility breakpoint of < or =2 microg/ml was adopted for clinical trials to generate corresponding clinical response data for isolates for which mics were as high as 2 microg/ml. of 234 streptococcus pneumoniae strains tested, 2 required ertapenem mics of 2 microg/ml and one required an mic of 4 microg/ml, among 67 non-streptococcus pyogenes, non-streptococcus pneumoniae streptococci, single isolates required ertapenem mics of 2 and 16 microg/ml. these streptococci also had diminished susceptibilities to other beta-lactams, including imipenem as well as ertapenem.  the etest and disk diffusion gave susceptibility test results in good agreement with those of the broth microdilution method for ertapenem.

TI  == staphylococcus aureus resistance to human defensins and evasion of neutrophil killing via the novel virulence factor mprf is based on modification of membrane  lipids with l-lysine.
AB  == defensins, antimicrobial peptides of the innate immune system, protect human mucosal epithelia and skin against microbial infections and are produced in large amounts by neutrophils. the bacterial pathogen staphylococcus aureus is insensitive to defensins by virtue of an unknown resistance mechanism. we describe a novel staphylococcal gene, mprf, which determines resistance to several host defense peptides such as defensins and protegrins. an mprf mutant strain was killed considerably faster by human neutrophils and exhibited attenuated virulence in mice, indicating a key role for defensin resistance in the pathogenicity of s. aureus. analysis of membrane lipids demonstrated that the mprf mutant no longer modifies phosphatidylglycerol with l-lysine. as this unusual modification leads to a reduced negative charge of the membrane surface,  mprf-mediated peptide resistance is most likely based on repulsion of the cationic peptides. accordingly, inactivation of mprf led to increased binding of  antimicrobial peptides by the bacteria. mprf has no similarity with genes of known function, but related genes were identified in the genomes of several pathogens including mycobacterium tuberculosis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococcus faecalis. mprf thus constitutes a novel virulence factor, which may  be of general relevance for bacterial pathogens and represents a new target for attacking multidrug resistant bacteria.

TI  == probiotic activities of lactobacillus casei rhamnosus: in vitro adherence to intestinal cells and antimicrobial properties.
AB  == the interest of probiotics as remedies for a broad number of gastrointestinal and other infectious diseases has gained wide interest over the last few years, but little is known about their underlying mechanism of action. in this study, the probiotic activities of a human isolate of lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus strain (lcr35) were investigated. using intestinal caco-2 cell line in an in vitro model, we demonstrated that this strain exhibited adhesive properties. the  inhibitory effects of lcr35 organisms on the adherence of three pathogens, enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec) and klebsiella pneumoniae, were determined. a decrease in the number of adhering pathogens was observed, using either preincubation, postincubation or coincubation of the pathogens with lcr35. moreover, the antibacterial activities  of cell-free lcr35 supernatant was examined against nine human pathogenic bacteria, etec, epec, k. pneumoniae, shigella flexneri, salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and clostridium difficile. the growth of all strains was inhibited, as measured by determining the number of viable bacteria over time, but no bactericidal activity was detected in this in vitro assay. together, these findings suggest that this probiotic strain could be used to prevent colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by a large variety of pathogens.

TI  == [identification of microbial subtypes from antibiotic susceptibility data in clinical laboratory for nosocomial infection surveillance].
AB  == we developed an algorism to identify microbial subtypes automatically from daily  antibiotic susceptibility data in clinical microbiology laboratory. the susceptibility pattern was expressed as a string of digits, each consisting of 0(resistant), 1(intermediate) or 2(susceptible) to respective antibiotics. any two patterns were regarded identical and combined if the difference at each digit never exceeds 1. the combined pattern was expressed as an array of digit-by-digit weighted averages of the two. the second combination was based on a degree of similarity among the numerical patterns using a formula, which was designed to emphasize differences in highly variable elements. this subgrouping procedure was done every three months. identity of the detected subtypes between the intervals  was determined using the same algorism as for the second combination. the algorism was applied to data of clinical isolates of mrsa, pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa), klebsiella pneumoniae (kp), enterococcus faecalis (ef), streptococcus pneumoniae (sp), escherichia coli (ec) that were obtained over a period of 4 years. three major subtypes of mrsa, kp and ef were consistently detected with shifting mutual frequencies. most of ec isolates belonged to two consistent subtypes. although pa and sp had one or two consistent subtypes, there were multiple minor subtypes of varying frequencies. this analysis is regarded as an "infotyping", in contrast to serotype or genotype, of clinical microbial isolates, which is useful for nosocomial infection surveillance.

TI  == a novel heterodimeric antimicrobial peptide from the tree-frog phyllomedusa distincta.
AB  == we present here the purification and the analysis of the structural and functional properties of distinctin, a 5.4 kda heterodimeric peptide with antimicrobial activity from the tree-frog phyllomedusa distincta. this peptide was isolated from the crude extract of skin granular glands by different chromatographic steps. its minimal inhibitory concentration was determined against pathogenic escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometric  investigations demonstrated that distinctin is constituted of two different polypeptide chains connected by an intermolecular disulphide bridge. circular dichroism and fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy studies showed that this  molecule adopts, in water, a structure containing a significant percentage of anti-parallel beta-sheet. a conformational variation was observed under experimental conditions mimicking a membrane-like environment. database searches  did not show sequence similarities with any known antimicrobial peptides. in the  light of these results, we can consider distinctin as the first example of a new  class of antimicrobial heterodimeric peptides from frog skin.

TI  == oral fluoroquinolone therapy results in drug adsorption on ureteral stents and prevention of biofilm formation.
AB  == the oral administration of ciprofloxacin (250mg bid) and ofloxacin (300mg bid) in 40 patients with ureteral stents, led to drug levels on all the device surfaces that were higher than the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of escherichia coli (0.004--0.015 mg/l), the most common uropathogen. the drug levels in the film were higher than the mic of other common pathogens, namely pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.25--1.0 mg/l), enterococcus faecalis (0.25--2.0 mg/l) and staphylococcus aureus (0.12--0.5 mg/l) in a few cases (six, three and 14 cases out of 40, respectively). for both antibiotics, the concentrations were greater than the mic of many uropathogens on the film surrounding the devices (0.89 vs 0.31 mg/l respectively, p=0.05), and on the devices themselves (0.22 vs. 0.12 mg/l, p=0.207). adsorption of the antibiotics was higher to the film than to the  stent (p<0.0001). ciprofloxacin concentration on the film surrounding the stents  was significantly higher than that of ofloxacin (p=0.05), while there was no statistical concentration difference between the two antibiotics adsorbed onto the actual devices (p=0.207). no bacteria were found in patients' urine and no biofilms were detected. this is the first report of an oral antibiotic being adsorbed onto medical devices. it potentially provides a new approach of preventing infection, and avoids the need to pre-coat devices with agents whose use will be restricted once bacteria develop resistance to them. if biomaterial properties can be enhanced to increase further the adsorptive concentration of drug, the risk of infections and recalcitrant biofilm formation could be significantly reduced in a highly susceptible patient population.

TI  == chlorination of pure bacterial cultures in aqueous solution.
AB  == the fate and distribution of chlorine in aqueous solutions containing four pure bacterial cultures was studied. solutions were subjected to chlorination at different initial free chlorine concentrations. resulting concentrations of residual chlorine were determined by both dpd/fas titration and membrane introduction mass spectrometry (mims). in all cases, false-positive breakpoint chlorination curves, probably attributable to the formation of chloroorganic-n compounds, were observed by dpd/fas titration, while little or no inorganic residual chloramine was found by mims. free chlorine was observed in similar quantities by both methods after chlorine demand by bacterial cellular materials  in solution was satisfied. these results indicated the residual chloramines existed in the form of organic chloramines; these compounds are generally recognized as being poor antimicrobial agents. further investigation confirmed that the bacterial cells were the source of organic-n compounds. the kinetics of  chlorination of pure bacterial suspensions was also studied. the pattern of residual chlorine decay following chlorination of the bacterial suspensions indicated rapid initial free chlorine consumption, followed by slow free chlorine consumption, with trace quantities of inorganic chloramine being formed.

TI  == determination of the antibacterial efficacy of several antiseptics tested on skin by an 'ex-vivo' test.
AB  == there are many skin antiseptics commercially available. although their antibacterial activity has often been well studied, their potential effectiveness on skin remains poorly documented. to date, in-vivo protocols designed for the testing of the antimicrobial efficacy of antiseptics cannot use, for ethical reasons, pathogenic bacteria or new formulations whose toxicity in human subjects is unknown. an 'ex-vivo' test was recently developed to overcome these problems.  freshly excised human skin from abdominal or breast reduction was placed in a diffusion cell containing a maintenance medium in the recipient compartment. a bacterial inoculum was then applied to the stratum corneum and, after a drying step, antiseptic formulations were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity. several micro-organisms were investigated: - staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant ent. faecium (vre), s. epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli--with several biocides--para-chloro-meta-xylenol (pcmx, active compound of dettol), povidone iodine, triclosan (in isopropanol) and chlorhexidine. results from the ex-vivo test were compared with results obtained  in suspension and glass-carrier tests. the bactericidal activity of the biocides  depended upon the test performed and results were generally significantly different from one method to the other. all biocides tested in the suspension test achieved >4 log10 reduction in viable bacterial concentrations, apart from povidone iodine tested against ent. faecalis and vre. the antibacterial activity  of biocides tested in the glass-carrier test was significantly lower than in the  suspension test, with the exception of triclosan in isopropanol, which was as effective in both suspension and glass-carrier test. in the ex-vivo test, triclosan in isopropanol achieved a log10 reduction in viable bacterial concentration of 1.105-1.771 (with the exception of p. aeruginosa with 0.758 log10 reduction). pcmx, povidone iodine and chlorhexidine achieved log10 reductions in viable bacterial concentration of 0.303-0.901. chlorhexidine tested against p. aeruginosa produced a 1.94 log10 reduction in concentration. these results confirm previous observations about the need for testing the antimicrobial activity of antiseptics on skin surface to determine their in-situ  efficacy and encourage further the use of the ex-vivo protocol.

AB  == the objective of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial action of mineral trioxide aggregate (mta), portland cement, calcium hydroxide paste (chp), sealapex and dycal. the chemical elements of mta and two portland cements were also analyzed. four standard bacterial strains: staphylococcus aureus (atcc 6538), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853), bacillus subtilis (atcc 6633), one wild fungus, candida albicans (icb/usp-562), and one mixture of these were used. thirty petri plates with 20 ml of bhi agar were inoculated with 0.1 ml of the experimental suspensions. three cavities, each one measuring 4 mm in depth and 4 mm in diameter, were made in each agar plate using a copper coil and then completely filled with the product to be tested. the plates were pre-incubated for 1 h at environmental temperature followed by incubation at 37 degrees c for 48 h. the diameters of the zones of microbial inhibition were then measured. samples from diffusion and inhibition halos were extracted from each plate and immersed in 7 ml bhi broth and incubated at 37 degrees c for 48 h. analyses of chemical elements present in mta and in two samples of portland cement were performed with a fluorescence spectrometer rx. the results showed that the antimicrobial activity of chp was superior to those of mta, portland cement, sealapex and dycal, for all microorganisms tested, presenting inhibition zones of 6-9.5 mm and diffusion zones of 10-18 mm. mta, portland cement, and sealapex presented only diffusion zones and among these, sealapex produced the largest zone. dycal did not show inhibition or diffusion zones. portland cements contain the same chemical elements as mta except that mta also contains bismuth.

TI  == dermatan sulphate is released by proteinases of common pathogenic bacteria and inactivates antibacterial alpha-defensin.
AB  == defensins represent an evolutionarily conserved group of small peptides with potent antibacterial activities. we report here that extracellular proteinases secreted by the human pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes release dermatan sulphate by degrading dermatan sulphate-containing proteoglycans, such as decorin. dermatan sulphate was found to bind to neutrophil-derived alpha-defensin, and this binding completely neutralized its bactericidal activity. during infection, proteoglycan degradation and release of dermatan sulphate may therefore represent a previously unknown virulence mechanism, which could serve as a target for novel antibacterial strategies.

AB  == criteria for defining urinary tract infection have changed as the importance of low count bacteriuria in patients with symptoms of infection has been recognized. little has been published, however, regarding the ability of routine laboratory methods to meet this new challenge. we compared 1 microl and 10 microl calibrated plastic loops (nunc, denmark), to a commonly used dipslide method (uricult, orion, finland) using a 0.1 ml pipette as the gold standard. four typical uropathogens, e. coli, p. aeruginosa, s. saprophyticus and e. faecalis, were mixed in pooled human urine in numbers representing low counts, i.e. 10(2), 10(3), and 10(4), together with 10(5) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml, and sampling with the four methods was performed 20 times for each with each bacterium and each dilution. colony counts showed that in many cases the 1 microl loop did not  deposit any bacteria on the agar plate when colony counts were lower than 10(4) cfu/ml. the 10 microl loop constantly deposited 1.5 times higher numbers of bacteria than predicted, which correlated with the results of weighing the amount of water sampled, i.e. 15.24 (1.55) microg (mean (sd)). the dipslide counts correlated with the 10 microl loop although the agar mounts on the slides absorbed water equal to about 200 microl. there were no significant differences in the counts of the four different bacteria. variation coefficients increased with decreasing volumes sampled, but the 10 microl loop was found sufficiently exact to detect counts from 10(3) to 10(4), since only 10-fold multiples are usually reported for urine cultures.

AB  == the influence of non-quinolone antimicrobial agents on the antibacterial activities of gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin was determined using chequerboard, fractional inhibitory concentration, (fic) and time-kill analysis methods. in the chequerboard method, the quinolones were tested in combination with ten antimicrobial agents (macrolides, aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, vancomycin, rifampicin and chloramphenicol) against five bacterial strains (one strain each of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus  faecalis and streptococcus pneumoniae). in no incidence was antagonism (fic > or  = 4) or synergy (fic < or = 0.5) observed; all dual drug combinations involving gatifloxacin or ciprofloxacin showed additivity/indifference (fic > 0.5, < 4). by time-kill analysis, the strains were tested at a quinolone concentration equal to 8 x mic in combination with a second antibiotic at 0.5xits mic. these combinations killed non-enterococcal strains at rates similar to those with quinolones alone. however, rifampicin and chloramphenicol were often antagonistic (100-fold lesser killing) to the lethal action of gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin  against e. faecalis. these findings indicate that, with the exception of e. faecalis, the antibacterial activities of quinolones are generally additive/indifferent to those of other antimicrobial agents.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to see whether it is possible to prevent bacterial  adherence to bioabsorbable self-reinforced l-lactic acid polymer (sr-plla) urological stents. the sr-plla stents were coated with silver nitrate blended epsilon-caprolactone/l-lactide copolymer. the adherence of five bacterial strains (pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis and two strains of escherichia coli) to coated and non-coated sr-plla wires were tested. it was found that silver nitrate coating prevented the adherence of bacteria (except e.  faecalis) to sr-plla stents. the preventive effect correlated with the silver nitrate concentration. it was also found that silver nitrate coating reduced the  amount of bacteria in ambient urine. in conclusion, silver nitrate coating may reduce stent-associated bacterial infections by preventing the adherence of bacteria. further studies are needed to confirm its efficacy and safety in clinical practice.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of meropenem versus other extended-spectrum antimicrobial agents against 2,085 clinical isolates tested in 13 brazilian centers.
AB  == meropenem is a parenteral carbapenem antibacterial agent with a very broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. it is the second agent of its class to become available in brazil. the in vitro antibacterial activity of meropenem was compared with imipenem and four other antimicrobial agents in a multicenter study. this study involved 13 clinical microbiology laboratories, 10 of which came from 8 brazilian states. a total of 2,085 clinical isolates consecutively collected between december 1995 and march 1996 were susceptibility tested using the etest and following the nccls procedures. meropenem inhibited more than 90% of isolates of enterobacteriaceae at 0.5 microg/ml, except for citrobacter sp. (1 microg/ml). generally, meropenem was slightly more active than imipenem against gram-negative organisms and its spectrum of antimicrobial activity was broader than those of all other drugs tested. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, meropenem (mic50, 0.38 microg/ml) was approximately 8-fold more active than imipenem (mic 50,3 microg/ml). imipenem was two-to eight-fold more active than meropenem against some gram-positive specees oxacillin, including enterococcus faecalis (mic 50 of 0.75 microg/ml and 2 microg/ml respectively), oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic 50 of 0.47 &mul;g/ml and 0.094 microg/ml), oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (mic 50 of 0.064 microg/ml and 0.5mg/ml). against streptococcus sp. meropenem was slightly more active than imipenem (mic 50, 0.016 microg/ml). the results of this study may be used to guide empiric therapy in brazil and indicates that meropenem may have an important role in the treatment of infections caused by multiresistant strains of bacteria.

TI  == antibacterial spectrum of a novel des-fluoro(6) quinolone, bms-284756.
AB  == the in vitro spectrum of a novel des-fluoro(6) quinolone, bms-284756, was compared with those of five fluoroquinolones (trovafloxacin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin). bms-284756 was among the most active and often was the most active quinolone against staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), streptococci, pneumococci (including ciprofloxacin-nonsusceptible and penicillin-resistant strains), and enterococcus  faecalis. bms-284756 inhibited approximately 60 to approximately 70% of the enterococcus faecium (including vancomycin-resistant) strains and 90 to 100% of the enterobacteriaceae strains and gastroenteric bacillary pathogens at the anticipated mic susceptible breakpoint (</=4 microg/ml). against the nonfermenters, bms-284756 inhibited 90 to 100% of pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas stutzeri, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, flavobacterium spp., and acinetobacter spp. and 72% of pseudomonas aeruginosa strains at 4 microg/ml. against anaerobic bacteria, bms-284756 was among the most active, inhibiting essentially all strains tested. it had very low mics against the fastidious and atypical microbial species, in particular against mycoplasmas or ureaplasmas, borrelia burgdorferi, chlamydia, and gonococci. these results indicate that with  its broad antibacterial spectrum, bms-284756 should be evaluated clinically for the treatment of community and nosocomial infections.

TI  == use of oleic acid to reduce the population of the bacterial flora of poultry skin.
AB  == the effect of oleic acid on native bacterial flora of poultry skin was examined.  skin from commercial broiler carcasses was washed once or twice in solutions of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10% (wt/vol) oleic acid and rinsed in peptone water. aerobic bacteria, enterobacteriaceae, campylobacter, and enterococci in the rinsates were enumerated. significantly fewer aerobic bacteria, enterobacteriaceae, campylobacter, and enterococci were recovered from rinsates of skin washed in oleic acid than from control samples. additionally, fewer bacteria were recovered from rinsates of skin washed in higher concentrations of oleic acid than from skin washed in lower concentrations of the fatty acid. in most cases, there was no significant difference in the number of bacteria recovered from rinsates of skin washed once or twice in solutions of oleic acid. washing skin samples twice  in 10% solutions of oleic acid significantly reduced the number of aerobic bacteria, enterobacteriaceae, campylobacter, and enterococci that remained attached to the skin. campylobacter sp., enterococcus faecalis, and listeria monocytogenes isolates possessed the least resistance to the antibacterial activity of oleic acid in vitro, while escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed higher resistance. enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus lentus, and salmonella typhimurium had the greatest resistance to the antibacterial activity of oleic acid. findings indicate that oleic acid reduces the number of bacteria on the skin of processed broilers and that the fatty acid is bactericidal to several spoilage and pathogenic bacteria associated with poultry.

TI  == activity of cecropin p1 and fa-ll-37 against urogenital microflora.
AB  == two mammalian antimicrobial peptides, fa-ll-37 and cecropin p1, were tested for activity against six uropathogens and five lactobacillus strains by broth microdilution assay. both peptides inhibited escherichia coli at 25 microm (fa-ll-39), and 1.56 microm (cecropin p1), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.5 microm, and 25 microm), and klebsiella pneumoniae, (50 microm, and 1.56 microm), but not  enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus epidermidis. fa-ll-37 acted bacteriocidally against e. coli and bacteriostatically against the other two gram-negative organisms. cecropin p1 was bacteriocidal to all susceptible bacteria. lactobacilli were resistant to both peptides, with the exception of poultry isolate lactobacillus fermentum b-54, which was susceptible to fa-ll-37 at 100 microm. the differential activities of these peptides toward gram-negative uropathogens versus urogenital lactobacilli demonstrate their potential as a topical treatment for urinary tract infections. in addition, production of such peptides in vivo could be a natural mechanism to aid in the maintenance of the lactobacilli-dominated urogenital flora at the expense of pathogens.

TI  == ofloxacin-loaded liposomes: in vitro activity and drug accumulation in bacteria.
AB  == different ofloxacin-loaded unilamellar vesicles were prepared by the extrusion technique, and their antimicrobial activities were determined in comparison to those of the free drug by means of mic determinations with both american type culture collection standards and wild-type bacterial strains (six strains of enterococcus faecalis, seven strains of escherichia coli, six strains of staphylococcus aureus, and six strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa). the accumulation of ofloxacin and liposome-ofloxacin was measured by determining the  amount of the drug inside the bacteria as a function of time. encapsulated fluoroquinolone yielded mics which were at least twofold lower than those obtained with the free drug. in particular, liposomes made up of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine-cholesterol-dipalmitoylphosphatidylser ine and dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine-cholesterol-dihexadecylphosphate (4:3:4 molar ratio) provided the best improvement in antimicrobial activity against the various bacterial strains investigated. the liposome formulation produced higher  intracellular fluoroquinolone concentrations than those achieved simultaneously with the free drug in both e. coli and p. aeruginosa.

AB  == the aim of this study is to evaluate what pathogens are mainly responsible for infection among all hospitalised at our itu patients, to define the influence of  antibiotic use on the aetiology of nosocomial infection. the research was conducted on a six-bedded surgical itu in a 700-bed teaching hospital from january 1995 till june 1996. in august 1995 we changed infection control protocols (more stress on: handwashing with antiseptic soaps and routine microbiological culture for early prediction of infection) and antibiotic guidelines on our itu (third generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and vancomycin were used only as the last option and never in prevention). 1276 samples for microbiological culture were obtained in routine manner. from 60% positive cultures 1216 strains were isolated (tab. 1) and resistance to antibiotics were defined (tab. 3). monthly antibiotic consumption was expressed in defined daily dose (ddd) for 1000 hospitalisation-days. ddd = (x/y)/z x x 1000, were: x-cumulative antibiotic consumption during analysed period (g), y-standard daily dose (g/24 h), z-number of hospitalisation-days during analysed  period (tab. 2). values were expressed as the mean +/- standard error (se). relationships between variables were analysed using linear correlation. all data  were categorised for the frequency table. statistically significant differences were considered to exist when calculated p values were less than 0.05. there were no statistically significant differences in the number of treated patients, length of stay and mortality rate on our itu in 18 months. 58% of isolated strains were gram-negative bacteria especially pseudomonas aeruginosa (22%) and acinetobacter spp. (16%) and proteus spp. (9%). the commonly isolated gram-positive bacteria were enterococcus faecalis (14%), staphylococcus aureus (12%)--of which 90% were mrsa. in 8% of cases we have isolated candida spp. monthly antibiotic consumption was displayed in table 2. trend analysis confirmed reduction in ofloxacin, fluoroquinolones and colistin consumption over 18 months  period (fig. 2). we observed statistically significant decrease in amount of isolated proteus spp. strains from 70 in i'95 to 31 in ii'95 (p < 0.05) and 10 in i'96 (p < 0.005). this observation was confirmed in trend analysis (fig. 1). we have observed in analysed period improvement in activities of third generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones (tab. 3). we have analysed the influence of antibiotic use on the aetiology of nosocomial infection. table 4 shows statistically significant correlation between acinetobacter spp., mrsa, mrse isolates and antibiotics consumption. crosstabulated variables analyses confirm mrse outbreaks in periods when excessive amount of amikacin (p < 0.05 for chi 2 test, d somer rate 0.59, v cramer rate 0.67), aminoglicosides (p < 0.05 for chi 2 test, d somer rate 0.57, v cramer rate 0.59), imipenem (p < 0.05 for chi 2 test,  d somer rate 0.44, v cramer rate 0.60) and total antibiotics consumption were high (p < 0.005 for chi 2 test, d somer rate 0.67, v cramer rate 0.81) (fig. 3).  this study illustrates the influence of antimicrobial therapy on the species and  the resistance of strains isolated in nosocomial infection. restrictive antibiotics policy does not affect itu outcome. better strategies for antibiotic  administration in the itu setting may improve their efficacy and control the spread of nosocomial infection caused by multi-resistant organisms. therefore, restrictive antibiotic policy would be mandatory in each hospital and department.

TI  == [frequency and antibiotic susceptibility of urinary pathogens isolated in the microbiology and virology laboratory of the careggi general hospital in the period july-december 1996].
AB  == background: the aim of the study was to evaluate the isolation frequency and antibiotic susceptibility of pathogens isolated form urinocoltures. methods: 2192 bacterial strains obtained from urine cultures with bacterial count > 100,000 ufc/ml were examined in our laboratory from july through december 1996. inpatients as well as outpatients were considered. five different ward typologies were taken into account (surgery, medicine, obstetrics, spinal unit and high risk wards). isolation frequencies were evaluated for each ward, but in order to get an adequate statistical sample they were divided into in two categories, e.g. strains isolated from inpatients and from outpatients. antibiotic susceptibility  was also evaluated dividing the data into the same two categories. for strains isolated with lower frequencies that was not possible, and data from inpatients were grouped with data from outpatients. results: the results obtained show that  bacterial species most frequently isolated among inpatients are escherichia coli  (45.7%), enterococcus faecalis (16.8%), proteus mirabilis (9.1%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.9%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (6.4%). those most frequently isolated among outpatients are escherichia coli (58.1%), enterococcus faecalis (12.3%), proteus mirabilis (9.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (4.4%) and coagulase negative staphylococci (4.0%). as far as antibiotic susceptibility is concerned,  whenever a statistically significant difference in sensitivity could be observed  between strains isolated from inpatients and strains isolated from outpatients, sensitivity was always higher for outpatients strains. conclusions: isolation frequency and antibiotic susceptibility are different depending on the place of origin of the patients (inpatients/outpatients). this implies a different approach to the empiric therapy in urinary tract infections.

TI  == bacterial contamination of bath-water from spinal cord lesioned patients with pressure ulcers exercising in the water.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the bacterial contamination of the water from the microflora of  pressure ulcers in para- and tetraplegic patients, when they were exercising in water at 36 degrees c for half an hour. material: twelve spinal cord lesioned (scl) patients with ulcers participated, and six of the 12 scl patients with healed ulcers constituted a control group. methods: the evaluation was performed  both with and without the ulcer covered with a moisture reactive occlusive dressing, duoderm. bacterial samples were taken from the bath-water before and after the exercise programmes and additionally specimens were obtained from the ulcer, the patients skin and urine, and from the skin of the physiotherapist who  exercised the patient. a similar procedure was carried out in the controls. results: the bacteriologic analyses showed no significant difference in the contamination of the bath-water after exercising with or without duoderm covering the ulcers. in half of the patients duoderm loosened. after all exercise programmes with or without duoderm dressing the water was contaminated with facultative aerobic intestinal bacteria, ie e. faecalis and enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, klebsiella species, proteus species, enterobacter species). in nearly one-third of the exercise sessions the bath-water was contaminated with p. aeruginosa before starting, and after the exercise programmes one fourth of the ulcers were colonized with these pathogens. conclusion: the water specimen showed the bacteria from the intestine to be much more prominent than the bacteria coming from the ulcers. thus the pressure ulcers were of minor importance for the bath-water and ought not to prohibit patients from the potential benefits of water exercise, but chlorination of the water in the training pool seems appropriate.

TI  == bactericidal activity of gatifloxacin (am-1155) against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis in an in vitro bladder model simulating human urinary concentrations after oral administration.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of gatifloxacin, a new 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone, was determined in a dynamic in vitro model mimicking complicated lower urinary tract infection. strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis with different susceptibility were exposed to changing gatifloxacin concentrations, simulating human urinary concentrations afer oral treatment with 200 mg twice daily for 3 consecutive days. bacterial numbers of p. aeruginosa (minimal inhibitory concentrations, mic: < or =32 microg/ml) and of e. faecalis (mic: 16 microg/ml) were reduced to undetectable levels during exposure. for the strains with lower susceptibility, gatifloxacin showed bactericidal activity, but eradication was not complete. thus, in a complicated urinary tract infection model, breakpoint mics of gatifloxacin for uropathogenic organisms were presumed  to range from 16 to 32 microg/ml. at least 86% of recent clinical isolates of p.  aeruginosa and e. faecalis were inhibited at its breakpoint mic. these results suggest that gatifloxacin may be useful in the treatment of urinary tract infections.

AB  == for the first national surveillance of antibiotic resistance in taiwan, we collected in 1998 from 22 hospitals (6 medical centers, 15 regional hospitals, and 1 local hospital) 3,211 isolates in all parts of the country. besides 50 random successive isolates from inpatients, each hospital was requested to collect 25 isolates each from positive blood cultures, hospital-acquired infections, outpatients and the pediatric department. we re-speciated all the submitted specimens and determined their antibiotic susceptibility patterns. the  most common isolates were enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae), staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. among hospital-acquired infections, acinetobacter spp. were among those which accounted for over 10% of the isolates. the oxacillin resistance of s. aureus was 82% in isolates from hospital-acquired infections, and 40% from outpatients. among enterococcus spp., 85% were either e. faecalis or e. faecium. they were 14% resistant to vancomycin. among gram-negative bacteria, k. pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumanii were hospital-acquired isolates that were most clearly more resistant than community acquired isolates. this difference was less apparent in the case of enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and p. aeruginosa. these bacteria were generally more resistant from all sources. fifty-one percent of salmonella were resistant to ampicillin; however, these were all sensitive to ciprofloxacin. isolates from the east were least resistant. plotting the disc zone diameters of antibiotics within the susceptible range, we  identified subpopulations with smaller diameters in the case of vancomycin against s. aureus, ciprofloxacin against e. coli, and ciprofloxacin against salmonella spp. these findings represent one of the purposes of this surveillance as they may portend developing resistances which bear careful watching in the future.

AB  == the authors characterized the in vitro antibacterial properties of clinical doses of lidocaine on isolates of a variety of bacterial pathogens commonly encountered in the setting of nosocomial wound infection (enterococcus faecalis, escherichia  coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus) as well as a number of resistant strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. time-kill studies were carried out on bacteria exposed to various clinical concentrations of lidocaine (0%, 1%, 2%, and 4%) with and without epinephrine (1:100,000). minimum inhibitory concentrations and minimum bactericidal concentrations were determined for some strains using a broth macrodilution method recommended by the national committee of clinical laboratory standards. lidocaine demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of growth for all strains of bacteria tested. the greatest sensitivity to lidocaine was shown by gram-negative organisms; the least sensitive was s. aureus. the addition of epinephrine to the local anesthetic had no effect on the susceptibility of the bacteria to lidocaine. these observations suggest that the surgical benefit of local anesthesia may extend beyond its analgesic properties and may have a role in the prophylaxis and, in the case of methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant bacteria, the treatment of surgical wound infection, mandating a wider application of this modality.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of dental impression materials.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to measure the in vitro killing effects five commercial alginate impression materials had on five test microorganisms. methods: two alginates with no added disinfectant, one supplemented with chlorhexidine and two others containing quaternary ammonium compounds were tested. challenge microbes included two gram-positive cocci, two gram-negative bacilli and a yeast. saline solutions containing standardized concentrations of test microbes were used to mix the alginates. some set specimens were immediately homogenized and the resulting fluids diluted and spread plated. other specimens were processed 30 or 60 min after setting. after culturing, the numbers of colonies were counted and the levels of microbial reductions determined. results: unsupplemented alginates had no antimicrobial effects. the quaternary-ammonium-containing alginates were completely effective against all five test microorganisms. the alginate with chlorhexidine killed all the gram-negative bacilli and the majority (95-99%) of the gram-positive cocci and yeast. significance: results indicated that disinfectant-containing alginate impression materials could reduce the number of soiling microorganisms present on and within test specimens.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between july 1996 and june 1997].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained during period from july 1996 to june 1997. the number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. a total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). from primary infections 162 strains were isolated,  and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. from primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was the highest.  in postoperative infections, the majority of them were enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were enterococcus avium. the isolation  rate of staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of enterococcus spp. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and enterobacter cloacae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like b. fragilis group and of aerobic gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. we found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither staphylacoccus aureus nor enterococcus spp.; however, the mic of arbekacin for one of strains of s. aureus  was 100 micrograms/ml. both the mic90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against p. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.

TI  == prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance in 20 european university hospitals participating in the european sentry antimicrobial surveillance programme.
AB  == the aim of this study was to analyse the current prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance in europe and compare the in vitro activity of amikacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin against 7057 bacterial isolates from 20 university hospitals participating in the european sentry antimicrobial surveillance programme. amikacin exhibited better in vitro activity than tobramycin and gentamicin against most gram-negative bacilli in europe. the resistance levels were 0.4-3% for amikacin, 2-13.1% for gentamicin, and 2.5-15.3% for tobramycin among different members of the family enterobacteriaceae. of the staphylococcus aureus  isolates tested, 75% were susceptible to gentamicin. only 21% of all enterococcal strains tested were fully susceptible to gentamicin. although intra-country variations in the prevalence of resistance phenotypes in escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as in staphylococci and enterococci did occur, aminoglycoside resistance rates were generally higher in italy, portugal, spain, greece, france, the uk, and poland than in austria, belgium, germany, the netherlands, and switzerland. compared with the 1987-88 data of the european study group on antibiotic resistance, gentamicin resistance  has increased up to 5% in some gram-negative bacterial species. furthermore, a greater than 10% increase in resistance to gentamicin has been seen in staphylococcus aureus during the last decade. the reason for this observation is  unclear, although changes in antibiotic prescribing patterns that result in increased selective pressure from gentamicin may have contributed to these increased rates of aminoglycoside resistance.

TI  == formation and structure of mixed bacterial communities.
AB  == mixed bacterial communities are formed by unrelated bacteria on solid media. mixed bacterial communities on solid media are similar to "classical" colonies and are formed after the growth of a large number of unrelated bacteria simultaneously plated onto a limited area of agar. the morphology of the mixed bacterial communities was similar for different combinations of bacteria and did  not change when the bacteria were plated on different media. different bacterial  strains form zones of individual and mixed growth in the structure of mixed bacterial communities. the results of electron microscopic examination indicate that mixed bacterial communities are isolated from their external environment by  a surface film. the basic part of this film is formed by an elementary membrane.  the membrane of the surface film of mixed bacterial communities is a stable structure occupying a large surface area. the results of this investigation seem  to indicate the existence of a special type of co-operation between different species of bacteria. this type of co-operation may be very important in the regulation of interactions between different bacteria and between bacteria and the environment.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of essential oils and other plant extracts.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of plant oils and extracts has been recognized for many years. however, few investigations have compared large numbers of oils and extracts using methods that are directly comparable. in the present study, 52 plant oils and extracts were investigated for activity against acinetobacter baumanii, aeromonas veronii biogroup sobria, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia col, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotype typhimurium, serratia marcescens and staphylococcus aureus, using an agar dilution method. lemongrass, oregano and bay inhibited all organisms at concentrations of < or = 2.0% (v/v). six oils did not  inhibit any organisms at the highest concentration, which was 2.0% (v/v) oil for  apricot kernel, evening primrose, macadamia, pumpkin, sage and sweet almond. variable activity was recorded for the remaining oils. twenty of the plant oils and extracts were investigated, using a broth microdilution method, for activity  against c. albicans, staph. aureus and e. coli. the lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations were 0.03% (v/v) thyme oil against c. albicans and e. coli and 0.008% (v/v) vetiver oil against staph. aureus. these results support the notion  that plant essential oils and extracts may have a role as pharmaceuticals and preservatives.

TI  == bloodstream infections in a neonatal intensive-care unit: 12 years' experience with an antibiotic control program.
AB  == objective: to assess the prevalence of gram-positive coccal (gpc), gram-negative  bacillary (gnb), and fungal blood-stream infections (bsis) during a 12-year period in which a consistent antibiotic treatment protocol was in place; to evaluate the efficacy of these antibiotic policies in relation to treatment, to the emergence of bacterial or fungal resistance, and to the occurrence of infection outbreaks or epidemics. study design: case series. methods: demographic, clinical, and bacteriological information from 363 infants born during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997 who developed 433 blood-culture-proven bsis was analyzed. early-onset bsis were defined as those infections discovered within 48 hours of birth, and late-onset bsis as those that occurred thereafter. suspected early-onset bsis were treated with ampicillin and  gentamicin, and suspected late-onset bsis with vancomycin and gentamicin. antibiotics were changed on the basis of organism antimicrobial susceptibility. results: early-onset bsis were noted in 52 of 21,336 live births and 40 of 20,402 live births during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997, respectively. gpc (83% due to group b streptococcus [gbs]) accounted for approximately one half of  early-onset bsi cases and gnb (68% enterobacteriaceae) for the remainder. early-onset gbs declined from 24 to 11 cases (p=.04) and late-onset bsi increased from 111 to 230 cases (p<.01) from the first to the last study period. sixty-eight percent of late-onset bsis were due to gpc (primarily coagulase-negative staphylococcus), 18% to gnb, and 14% to fungus. over the study period, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from the newborn intensivecare unit (unlike those strains from other hospital units) remained fully susceptible to ceftazidime and  gentamicin. although the hospitalwide prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus increased, all 17 newborn bsi cases were due to methicillin-sensitive strains. prevalence of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus increased, although all strains remained vancomycin-susceptible, as did the 16 enterococcus faecalis isolates. all fungi recovered (from 48 patients) were susceptible to amphotericin. conclusion: we observed a decrease in the prevalence of early-onset bsis due to gbs and an increase in late-onset bsis due to gpc, gnb, and fungi. the combination of ampicillin and gentamicin for suspected early-onset bsis and vancomycin and gentamicin for late-onset bsis has been successful for treatment of individual patients without the occurrence of infection outbreaks or the emergence of resistance. controlled antibiotic programs and periodic evaluations based on individual unit and not on hospitalwide antibiograms are advisable.

AB  == gatifloxacin (formerly am-1155 and cg5501), a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone, has  an expanded spectrum of activity against gram-positive cocci and some anaerobic bacteria. this compound was tested against 600 recent clinical strains of rapidly growing aerobic species to establish susceptibility testing interpretive criteria for the reference broth microdilution and standardized disk (5-microgram) diffusion methods of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls). these strains included 285 enterobacteriaceae (17 species), 165 staphylococci, 49 enterococci, and 101 nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. based on achievable serum levels with projected gatifloxacin dosing regimens, mic break points of < or = 2 micrograms/ml (> or = 18 mm) for susceptibility and > or = 8 micrograms/ml (< or = 14 mm) for resistance were selected. the absolute agreement between tests was 94.3% with no very major false-resistant errors. the  quality control ranges (mic and zone diameters) for the nccls recommended strains were determined in a nine-laboratory nccls protocol as follows: escherichia coli  atcc 25922 = 0.008-0.03 microgram/ml and 31-37 mm; enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212 = 0.12-1 microgram/ml; pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 = 0.5-2 micrograms/ml and 21-27 mm; staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 = 27-33 mm and s. aureus atcc 29213 = 0.03-0.12 microgram/ml. gatifloxacin appears to be a promising new fluoroquinolone with acceptable susceptibility testing methods for  routine clinical laboratory use.

TI  == [antibiotic sensitivity of pneumonia pathogens in newborns and problems of antibacterial therapy of the pathologic process].
AB  == the results of the bacteriological investigation of the secretion from the trachea, large bronchi and fauces of 36 newborns (including 27 preterms) with severe pneumonia were analyzed. 20 of them were born of women with complicating somatic, obstetric and gynecologic histories: candidiasis, herpes genitalis, chronic endometritis, adnexitis or chronic pyelonephritis that could be the risk  of the fetus intranatal infection. during the acute period of pneumonia in the newborns within the first 4-8 days of life mainly pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated (51.3 per cent), staphylococcus epidermidis, s. haemolyticus and enterococcus faecalis were less frequent (18.9, 8.1 and 5.4 per cent, respectively). klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus anhaemolyticus and other organisms were extremely rare. on the whole the gramnegative microflora predominated. the study of the antibiotic susceptibility showed that the majority of the p. aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to amikacin and polymyxin b, the isolates susceptible to ceftazidime were less frequent, 20-25 per cent of the isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone and imipenem and practically no isolates were susceptible to gentamicin. the s.epidermidis isolates were susceptible to rifampicin and vancomycin and in rare cases to fusidin and amikacin and resistant to oxacillin. when the treatment course was more than 15 days, the isolates proved to be susceptible to 1/3 of the presently  available antibiotics. because of the host low protective forces, peculiarities of the infection pathways and high frequency of the resistant strains it is valid to include netilmicin, imipenem, cefoperazone and ceftriaxone to the complex therapy of the newborns along with the substitution immunotherapy.

TI  == in vitro activity of meropenem against common pathogenic bacteria isolated in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in taiwan. meropenem was active against most gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis. for many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. it is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. it is uncommon for these common bacteria, except mrsa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to  other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.

TI  == a sensitive and quick microplate method to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration of plant extracts for bacteria.
AB  == agar diffusion techniques are used widely to assay plant extracts for antimicrobial activity, but there are problems associated with this technique. a  micro-dilution technique was developed using 96-well microplates and tetrazolium  salts to indicate bacterial growth. p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet [0.2 mg/ml] gave better results than tetrazolium red or thiazolyl blue. the method is quick,  worked well with staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli and with non-aqueous extracts from many different plants. the method gave reproducible results; required only 10-25 microliters of extract to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations, distinguished between microcidal and microstatic effects, and provided a permanent record of the results. using s. aureus, and a combretum molle extract,  the technique was 32 times more sensitive than agar diffusion techniques and was  not sensitive to culture age of the test organism up to 24 hours. the s. aureus culture could be stored up to 10 days in a cold room with little effect on the assay results. this method was useful in screening plants for antimicrobial activity and for the bioassay-guided isolation of antimicrobial compounds from plants. mic values determined for sulfisoxazole, norfloxacin, gentamicin, and nitrofuratoin were similar to values indicated in the literature but values obtained with trimethroprim and ampicillin were higher with some bacteria.

TI  == interference in initial adhesion of uropathogenic bacteria and yeasts to silicone rubber by a lactobacillus acidophilus biosurfactant.
AB  == the ability of the lactobacillus acidophilus rc14 biosurfactant 'surlactin' to inhibit the initial adhesion of various uropathogenic bacteria and two yeast strains to silicone rubber was investigated in a parallel-plate flow chamber in filter-sterilised pooled human urine. a parallel-plate flow chamber with a silicone rubber bottom plate was filled with a 1.0 mg/ml biosurfactant solution for adsorption overnight (18 h). subsequently, the adhesion of the bacterial or yeast cells from a urine suspension under low flow (shear rate 15 s(-1)) was followed in situ by automated image analysis. control tests were with untreated silicone rubber. initial deposition rates and numbers of adhering cells after 4 h of flow were determined. surlactin layers caused a marked inhibition of the initial deposition rates and adhesion numbers after 4 h for the majority of the bacteria (11 of 15 strains tested) and this inhibition was particularly effective against enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis. although the initial deposition rates of the two candida albicans strains were reduced by c. 50% in comparison with the controls, the numbers of yeast cells adhering after 4 h were similar.

TI  == the preliminary isolation of several antibacterial compounds from combretum erythrophyllum (combretaceae).
AB  == freeze dried ground leaves of combretum erythrophyllum were extracted with different extractants to determine if they contain inhibitors of pathogenic bacteria. acetone yielded the most compounds inhibiting the growth of staphylococcus aureus using bioautography of thin layer chromatography plates. acetone also extracted many different compounds and group separation was attempted by solid phase extraction on reverse and normal phase silica gel. both  techniques separated the bioactive components to a degree. the best group separation results, however, were obtained using liquid/liquid extraction. the six fractions obtained inhibited the four test organisms to different degrees. s. aureus was the most sensitive (100%) followed by enterococcus faecalis (36%), escherichia coli (11%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (3%). with s. aureus as test organism, the chloroform soluble fraction contained by far the largest quantity of inhibiting components (100%), followed by the fractions soluble in water (23%), 35% methanol in water (18%), butanol (5%), carbon tetrachloride (2%) and hexane (traces). the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration for s. aureus was 0.05 mg/ml at this stage of purification compared to mic values of 0.08 and 0.16  mg/ml for ampicillin and chloramphenicol. there were at least 14 different inhibitors with a wide range of polarities present in the different fractions. the polar components apparently did not contain polysaccharides and were probably basic according to the chromatographic behaviour.

TI  == in vitro susceptibility testing and quality control parameters for sarafloxacin (a-56620): a fluoroquinolone used for treatment and control of colibacillosis in  poultry. quality control study group.
AB  == sarafloxacin (formerly a-56620) is a fluoroquinolone recently introduced into veterinary practice for the therapy of colibacillosis and other indicated infections. sarafloxacin was noted to be very active and comparable to ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin for inhibiting 823 strains from a wide variety of  species at < or = 1 or < or = 2 micrograms/ml. in vitro susceptibility tests for  sarafloxacin using national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) methods were also studied and interpretive criteria for escherichia coli-associated colibacillosis isolates were proposed: susceptible at < or = 0.06 microgram/ml (> or = 25 mm) and resistant at > or = 0.25 microgram/ml (< or = 21  mm). sarafloxacin agar dilution mic results were approximately one log2 dilution  higher than broth microdilution endpoints. the interpretive criteria demonstrated a low error rate of 5.9%, with a very major rate of only 0.5% (correlation coefficient between methods = 0.94). quality control trials in six laboratories established mic and zone diameter (5-microgram disk) limits for the nccls recommended strains: for the broth microdilution test, e. coli atcc 25922 = 0.008 to 0.03 microgram/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 = 0.12 to 1 microgram/ml, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212 = 0.5 to 2 micrograms/ml, and staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213 = 0.06 to 0.25 microgram/ml; and for the disk diffusion test, e. coli atcc 25922 = 30 to 36 mm, s. aureus atcc 25923 = 25 to 30 mm, and p. aeruginosa atcc 27853 = 23 to 29 mm. these criteria for in vitro tests with sarafloxacin should enable the longitudinal monitoring of its activity against the indicated pathogens and allow detection of emerging resistant populations that may necessitate altered dosing regimens.

TI  == antibodies to urinary tract pathogens in patients with spinal cord lesions.
AB  == chronic or recurrent urinary tract infection (uti) is a significant problem or patients with spinal cord lesions (scl). utis are thought to be a major factor in the development of reduced renal function. to investigate the pathogenesis 151 patients with scl were included in this study during a 7 year period. results of  intravenous pyelography and isotope renography were recorded as well as the bladder emptying methods. one to seven blood samples were obtained from each patient and tested for plasma creatinine, and the presence of precipitating antibodies against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, klebsiella ozaenae, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. we found significant correlation between duration of scl and precipitating antibodies against urinary tract pathogens (pau) (r = 0.23, p < 0.005), between plasma creatinine and pau in patients with spina bifida (r = 0.64, p < 0.01), between pau and the number of positive urine cultures (r = 0.17; p < 0.05) and a relation between abnormal urological findings and pau. in addition, the pau was significantly higher in patients with indwelling urethral catheters (p < 0.001).  thus it seems that pau can be of prognostic value in scl patients, and pau might  be an indicator for intensified treatment of recurrent uti.

TI  == bactericidal effect of levofloxacin on strains with equal susceptibility in an in vitro urinary bladder model.
AB  == the in vitro bactericidal effects of therapeutic concentrations of levofloxacin (lvfx) on clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis were assessed. starting from 10(7) cfu/ml, the bacterial count was determined serially during the exposure to lvfx present at concentrations automatically simulated to its clinically achievable urinary levels at the recommended dosage (100 mg 3 times daily). an isolate of p. aeruginosa for which the mic of lvfx was 16 microgram/ml was completely eradicated after 10 h of exposure to lvfx. on the  other hand, 40 h of exposure to lvfx were required for complete eradication of an isolate of e. faecalis with equal susceptibility, although the bacterial count was rapidly reduced to 10(2) cfu/ml in the early phase of the exposure. it was concluded that lvfx exerts a more potent bactericidal effect on p. aeruginosa than on e. faecalis despite a similar susceptibility of these organisms to lvfx.

AB  == background: results of an ongoing surveillance of antibiotic resistance in hospitalized dermatology patients are presented. bacterial isolates cultured from patients with skin wounds admitted to a tertiary care dermatology inpatient unit  from may 1995 through may 1996 were evaluated for resistance to commonly used antibiotics. comparison was made with a previous survey of the same inpatient service from 1992. our results show an alarming trend toward antibiotic resistance. observation: in superficial skin wounds, staphylococcus aureus constituted 77% of isolates. in leg ulcers, the frequencies of s aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa were approximately equal, constituting 43% and 42% of cultures, respectively. fifty percent of s aureus isolates from leg ulcers were resistant to oxacillin, with 36% of pseudomonad isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin. in superficial wounds, oxacillin resistance in s aureus approached 25%. a comparison of antibiotic resistance profiles using data collected in 1992  for patients admitted to the same inpatient service revealed a marked increase in oxacillin and ciprofloxacin resistance in s aureus and p aeruginosa in leg ulcers, respectively (from 24% to 50% oxacillin resistance in s aureus and from 9% to 24% ciprofloxacin resistance in p aeruginosa), and superficial wounds (24%  to 36% ciprofloxacin resistance in p aeruginosa). conclusion: this study demonstrates the rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria as a problem of growing significance in hospital dermatology and highlights the importance of local surveillance programs to aid in selecting antibiotic treatments.

TI  == control of the immune response by dhea and its metabolites.
AB  == the 17 keto steroid, dehydroepiandrosterone (5-androsten-3 beta-17-one, dhea) has been shown to protect mice from a variety of lethal infections. this includes, but is not limited to, infection with viruses (herpesvirus type 2, coxsackievirus b4-cvb4),bacteria (enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa), and a parasite (cryptosporidium parvum). we have reported that androstenediol (5-androsten-3 beta-17 beta-diol, beta aed), which is derived from dhea, is at least 100x more effective in up-regulating systemic resistance against cvb4-infection than its precursor. furthermore, androstenetriol (5-androstene-3 beta-7 beta-17 beta-triol beta aet) which is formed by 7 beta hydroxylation of beta aed, was more effective against cvb4-infection than its precursor beta aed. neither steroid however has shown any significant direct antiviral effects. the in-vitro influences of dhea,  beta aed, and beta aet on a mitogen-induced mixed splenocyte proliferation assay  were determined. the results showed that dhea suppressed the proliferation of concanavalin a (con a) or lipopolysaccharide (lps) activated cultures in a dose dependent manner. beta aed had little influence on the activation response. however, beta aet potentiated the response to both mitogens significantly above control. the regulation of interleukin-2 and interleukin-3 secretion from con a-activated lymphocytes was analogous to these observations. these functions were suppressed by dhea, unaffected by beta aed, and potently increased by beta aet. moreover, the classic immuno-suppressive effects of hydro-cortisone on con a-induced lymphocyte proliferation, as well as il-2 and il-3 production were unaffected by co-cultured with dhea and only minimally counteracted by beta aed.  in contrast, beta aet significantly counteracted the effect of hydrocortisone when co-cultured together. these results show that while in-vivo, dhea, beta aed, and beta aet each function in a similar manner. in-vitro, their effects are dramatically different from one another with only beta aet potentiating the cellular response by increasing lymphocyte activation and counteracting the immuno-suppressive activity of hydrocortisone.

AB  == twelve healthy volunteers participated in this randomized crossover study to compare the concentrations and recovery levels of fleroxacin and pefloxacin in urine and to assess their bactericidal activities against 12 strains of urinary pathogens with different susceptibilities over a wide range of mics. the volunteers received a single oral dose of 400 mg of fleroxacin or 800 mg of pefloxacin. the mean cumulative renal excretion of unchanged fleroxacin, n-demethyl-fleroxacin, and n-oxide-fleroxacin accounted for 67, 7, and 6% of the  total dose, respectively. the total urinary recovery of pefloxacin and the active metabolite norfloxacin was 34%. in the time-kill and the urinary bactericidal titer (ubt) studies, only the subjects' urine not supplemented with broth was used. with most tested organisms and both quinolones it took more than 8 h to achieve a reduction in cfu of 99.9% (3 log units). overall, there was a good correlation between ubts and mics for the strains. against escherichia coli atcc  25922 the median ubts were similar for both antibiotics and at least 1:8 for 96 h; against the e. coli strain for which the mic was 0.5 microgram/ml the ubt was  at least 1:4 for 48 h. the ubts of both drugs against klebsiella pneumoniae were  at least 1:16 for 72 h. the ubts for staphylococcus aureus (the mic for which was 16 micrograms/ml) of both antibiotics were low, and in some of the samples, no bactericidal titers were observed. ubts for proteus mirabilis of pefloxacin are significantly higher than those of fleroxacin. for pseudomonas aeruginosa the median ubts were present for the 24-to-48-h interval. the same is true for enterococcus faecalis. against staphylococcus saprophyticus, ubts were present for at least 48 h with both quinolones. overall, a single oral dose of 400 mg of  fleroxacin exhibits ubts comparable to those of 800 mg of pefloxacin. therefore,  it may be expected that half of the dose of fleroxacin gives comparable results in the treatment of urinary tract infections; this should be substantiated in comparative clinical trials.

AB  == in an open, randomised monocentric crossover study in six male and six female healthy volunteers, the urinary antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetics of enoxacin, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were assessed. urine was collected up to  6 days, and venous blood samples up to 12 h, after a single oral dose of 400 mg enoxacin, 400 mg norfloxacin and 500 mg ciprofloxacin. enoxacin (250 mg/l) demonstrated the highest peak concentration (median) in the urine (0-6 h), followed by ciprofloxacin (237 mg/l) and norfloxacin (157 mg/l) as determined by  the hplc assay. the total amount (mean) excreted by the kidneys as parent drugs were as follows: enoxacin 54% of dose, ciprofloxacin 33% of dose, and norfloxacin 22% of dose. the mean plasma concentrations decreased from 1 to 4 h after administration for enoxacin from 1.9 to 1.4 mg/l, for ciprofloxacin from 2.0 to 0.8 mg/l and for norfloxacin from 1.3 to 0.5 mg/l. the antibacterial activity in  urine was determined as urinary bactericidal titers (ubt), i.e. the highest 2-fold dilution of urine still bactericidal for the reference organism (e. coli atcc 25,922) and for five uropathogens with minimal inhibitory (mic) and bactericidal (mbc) concentrations ranging from highly susceptible to resistant cultured from the urine of patients with complicated urinary tract infections (uti). for the e. coli atcc 25,922, the organism with the lowest mic, median ubts of ciprofloxacin were present for 4 days, decreasing from 1:512 to 1:2, that of enoxacin for 2 days, decreasing from 1:256 to 1:4, and that of norfloxacin for 2  days, decreasing from 1:128 to 1:2. for the five uropathogens (with increasing mics: k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, e. coli (resistant to nalidixic acid), p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis), the ubts decreased in general, according to mics, demonstrating the same relations of ubts for ciprofloxacin (highest) versus enoxacin (medium) versus norfloxacin (lowest) with one exception (p. mirabilis) for which norfloxacin showed higher ubts than enoxacin. the minimal urinary bactericidal concentrations (mubc), as derived from urinary concentrations, and ubts showed a fairly wide inter- and intraindividual range and were generally higher than the corresponding mbcs as determined in mueller hinton broth. in conclusion, according to antibacterial activity in urine determined as ubts, a single oral dose of ciprofloxacin (500 mg) generally resulted in the highest and  longest-lasting ubts followed by that of enoxacin (400 mg) and norfloxacin (400 mg). a dose of 400 mg enoxacin can be expected to be at least equivalent if not superior to that of 400 mg norfloxacin. only enoxacin and ciprofloxacin exhibited urinary bactericidal activity against all test organisms up to 12 h in all individuals. therefore, clinical comparison of enoxacin versus ciprofloxacin in the treatment of complicated uti could be worth testing.

TI  == novel antibiotic susceptibility tests by the atp-bioluminescence method using filamentous cell treatment.
AB  == antimicrobial susceptibility testing by the atp-bioluminescence method has been noted for its speed; it provides susceptibility results within 2 to 5 h. however, several disagreements between the atp method and standard methodology have been reported. the present paper describes a novel atp method in a 3.5-h test which overcomes these deficiencies through the elimination of false-resistance discrepancies in tests on gram-negative bacteria with beta-lactam agents. in our  test model using pseudomonas aeruginosa and piperacillin, it was shown that atp in filamentous cells accounted for the false resistance. we found that 0.5% 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol (ampd) extracted atp from the filamentous cells  without affecting normal cells and that 0.3 u of adenosine phosphate deaminase (apdase)/ml simultaneously digested the extracted atp. we used the mixture of these reagents for the pretreatment of cells in a procedure we named filamentous  cell treatment, prior to atp measurements. this novel atp method with the filamentous cell treatment eliminated false-resistance discrepancies in tests on  p. aeruginosa with beta-lactam agents, including piperacillin, cefoperazone, aztreonam, imipenem-cilastatin, ceftazidime, and cefsulodin. furthermore, this novel methodology produced results which agreed with those of the standard microdilution method in other tests on gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria,  including p. aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis, for non-beta-lactam agents, such as fosfomycin, ofloxacin, minocycline, and aminoglycosides. mics obtained by the novel atp method were also in agreement with those obtained by the agar dilution method of susceptibility testing. from these results, it was shown that the novel atp method could be used successfully to test the activities of antimicrobial agents with the elimination  of the previously reported discrepancies.

AB  == we examined the therapeutic effect of cefluprenam (cflp) on the polymicrobial urinary tract infection associated with infectious stones as compared to that of  ceftazidime (caz), using the experimental polymicrobial urinary tract infection caused by proteus mirabilis (p. mirabilis), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa) and enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis). in order to form bladder stones in rats, a sterile zinc ring was implanted as a foreign body, followed by  inoculating p. mirabilis e05106 transurethrelly. thereafter, p. aeruginosa e030033 and e. faecalis 966 were inoculated according to the same way. cflp or caz was administered intravenously twice a day for 5 days. the therapeutic effect was evaluated by the eradication of these bacteria from the urine, the kidney and stones, inhibition of growth of stones, and also a value of bun. the urinary excretion rates of cflp and caz was also determined (20 mg/kg). in result, cflp significantly more effective in the eradication of p. mirabilitis, p. aeruginosa  and e. faecalis from the urine, the kidney and stones than the control than the control (p < 0.05). furthermore, cflp significantly more effective in the eradication of p. aeruginosa from the urine and also e. facalis from the urine and stones (p < 0.05). meanwhile, caz significantly more effective in the eradication of p. mirabilis from the urine, the kidney and stones and also p. aeraginosa from the kidney and stones than the control. however, caz did not show eradicative effect on e. faecalis. the urinary excretion rates of cflp and caz at rats were 59.3% and 59.4%, respectively, within 8 hrs after administration, showing a similar excretion pattern. cflp exhibited the prominent therapeutic effect on polymicrobial urinary tract infection associated with infectious stones caused by p. mirabilis, p. aeruginosa and e. faecalls. on the basis of these results, it has been strongly suggested that cflp is highly beneficial in the management of intractable polymicrobial urinary tract infectious in clinic.

TI  == formulary review of the carbapenems: comparison of imipenem/cilastatin and meropenem.
AB  == in comparison with imipenem, meropenem exhibits closely similar microbiological activity. although meropenem has slightly greater gram-negative activity against  organisms, like pseudomonas aeruginosa and burkholderia cepacia, imipenem demonstrates more intense gram-positive activity, particularly towards enterococcus faecalis which may reduce or even cancel out, the clinical relevance of these microbiological differences. however, an aminoglycoside is usually added in the treatment of serious infections from these bacteria. the pharmacokinetics  of these two agents are also closely similar both in normal healthy volunteers and in patients with normal or impaired renal function. moreover, there is little, if any, difference in the acquisition costs for meropenem and imipenem in most hospitals. cost-avoidance with meropenem is, therefore, mainly the result of less frequent dosing and the ability to administer meropenem by rapid intravenous injection. additionally, meropenem's fda approved indication for central nervous  system infection offers an additional advantage when compared to imipenem/cilastatin. it was for these reasons that our hospital's pharmacy and therapeutics committee replaced imipenem/cilastatin with meropenem.

TI  == discovery of novel pyridinopolyamines with potent antimicrobial activity: deconvolution of mixtures synthesized by solution-phase combinatorial chemistry.
AB  == a 1638-member pyridinopolyamine library, consisting of 13 sublibraries of 126 members prepared by a solution-phase approach, was completely deconvoluted from orthogonally protected intermediates by a combination of iterative and positional scanning procedures. antibacterial assays against streptococcus pyogenes and escherichia coli imp- and a candida albicans yeast specificity assay were employed to follow the activity of sublibraries. screening of the 13 sublibraries, which were prepared by a synthetic method that places the differentiating functionality in a selected position a (secondary amine), at the  end of the synthesis (fix last), provided several first-round activities. subsequently, six single pyridinopolyamines (2-7) were prepared where the first-round winner, a hydrogen atom, is in the first deconvoluted position and the remaining three positions contained the same functionalities. the range of antibacterial and yeast activities of these single compounds suggested that a more active and selective compound may be discovered by completely deconvoluting  the first-round active sublibraries. pyridinopolyamine positions b (secondary benzylamine) and c (primary benzylamine) were then sequentially positionally scanned with a set of six meta-substituted benzyl functionalities to generate two sets of second/third-round sublibraries, containing 21 or 36 compounds in each sublibrary, respectively. high-throughput screening yielded sublibraries 15, 18,  and 21 with mics of 1-5 microm against s. pyogenes and e. coli imp-. using rounds 1 and 2/3 screening data, two sets of single compounds (22-27) and (28-32) with the combination of m-(trifluoromethyl)-benzyl group at position c and m-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl or m-methylbenzyl group at position b with position d (primary benzylamine) fixed were synthesized in the fourth round deconvolution. subsequently, broader screening of deconvoluted compounds against a tier ii panel of wild-type bacteria identified eight compounds (5, 7, 27, and 29-32) with approximately 100-fold greater selectivity for gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria. thus, s. pyogenes, s. pyogenes (wild-type), streptomyces aureus, and enterococcus faecalis were inhibited at mics of 1-12 microm, whereas mics for e.  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were >  100 microm. these eight compounds were not active (> 100 microm) against fungus c. albicans.

AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the clinical parameters and the  site prevalence and levels of 40 subgingival species in successfully treated and  refractory periodontitis subjects. 94 subjects received scaling and root planing  and if needed, periodontal surgery and systemically administered tetracycline. 28 refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or > 3 sites showing attachment loss > 2.5 mm within 1 year post-therapy. 66 successfully treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss > 2.5 mm. baseline subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the mean levels and % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject and differences between groups sought using the mann-whitney test. most of the 40 species tested, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus, were equally or less prevalent in the refractory group. prevotella nigrescens was significantly more prevalent in successfully treated subjects, while refractory subjects harbored a larger proportion of streptococcus species, particularly streptococcus constellatus. the odds of a subject being refractory was 8.6 (p < 0.001) if s. constellatus constituted > or = 3.5% of the  total dna probe count. since few microbiological differences existed between treatment outcome groups using dna probes to known species, the predominant cultivable microbiota of 33 subgingival samples from 14 refractory subjects was examined. 85% of the 1649 isolates were identified using probes to 69 recognized  subgingival species. the remaining unidentified strains were classified by analyzing 16s rrna gene sequences. many sequenced isolates were of taxa not considered a common part of the oral microbiota such as acinetobacter baumanni, gemella haemolysans, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus warneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa and novel species in the genera bartonella, ralstonia, neisseria, eubacterium, rothia, gordona, gemella, corynebacterium, leptotrichia, and actinomyces. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based on their subgingival microbiota. as a group, they did not harbor more of the "classic" periodontopathogens, although elevated proportions of s. constellatus were found.

TI  == role of chemotherapeutic antagonism in opportunistic infections.
AB  == the most widely-known anti-tumor drugs often induce marked immunosuppression which can give rise to one or more sepses. anti-infection measures immediately applied can sometimes prove largely ineffective or even useless, the patient dying not as a result of the spread of the tumour but as a direct consequence of  opportunistic infection. we postulate that antagonism between anti-tumour and antimicrobial drugs may also play an important part in this. by way of illustration of this hypothesis, we have studied the action of a number of known  inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis and of dna-gyrases on certain strains of gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms cultured in medium containing various concentrations of some of the best-known anti-tumour antimetabolites. the experimental data show that antimicrobial and anti-tumour drugs can sometimes induce synergic or indifferent chemotherapeutic interactions with many bacteria,  while in others the effect is antagonistic. in practice, the action of the drugs  could lead to bacterial selectivity, which, in conjunction with immunosuppression and the presence of resistant strains, could favour the evolution of opportunistic infection.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

AB  == new pyrrolidine derivatives, which bear an alkyloxime substituent in the 4-position and an aminomethyl substituent in the 3-position of the pyrrolidine ring, have been synthesized and coupled with various quinolinecarboxylic acids to produce a series of new fluoroquinolone antibacterials. these fluoroquinolones were found to possess potent antimicrobial activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, including methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). variations at the c-8 position of the quinolone nucleus included fluorine, chlorine, nitrogen, methoxy, and hydrogen atom substitution. the activity imparted to the substituted quinolone nucleus by the c-8 substituent was in the order f (c5-nh2) > f (c5-h) > naphthyridine > cl = ome = h against gram-positive organisms. in the case of gram-negative strains, activity was in the order f (c5-nh2) > naphthyridine = f (c5-h) > h > cl > ome. the advantages provided by the newly introduced oxime group of the quinolones were clearly demonstrated by their comparison to a desoximino compound 30. in addition, the oxime moiety greatly improved the pharmacokinetic parameters of the novel quinolones. among these compounds, compound 20 (lb20304) showed the best in vivo  efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile in animals, as well as good physical properties. the mics (microgram/ml) of lb20304, compound 30, and ciprofloxacin against several test organisms are as follows: s. aureus 6538p (0.008, 0.031, and 0.13), methicillin resistant s. aureus 241 (4, 16, and 128), streptococcus epidermidis 887e (0.008, 0.016, and 0.13), methicillin resistant s. epidermidis 178 (4, 32, and 128), enterococcus faecalis 29212 (0.063, 0.13, and 1), pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e (0.25, 0.5, and 0.13), escherichia coli 3190y (0.008, 0.016, and 0.008), enterobacter cloacae p99 (0.008, 0.031, and 0.008), actinobacter calcoaceticus 15473 (0.063, 0.13, and 0.25). on the basis of these promising results, lb20304 was selected as a candidate for further evaluation.

TI  == [relation between candidiasis and nutrition of patients and mrsa infection].
AB  == we evaluated the relation with nutritional state and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) infection of 20 patients who isolated candida of 31  patients who were suspected as candidiasis. all of the patients who were hospitalized in internal medicine wards in our hospital between february 1993 and january 1994. all patients with hematological disease were excluded. mrsa is now  gotten much attention as pathogen of hospital infection, but each mrsa is detected not only alone but also concomitant with other bacterium. in our hospital mrsa was detected alone 36.8% (39/106). candida 9.4% (10/106) was frequent as mixed infectious pathogen concomitant with mrsa following pseudomonas aeruginosa 19.8% (21/106) and enterococcus faecalis 12.3% (13/106). intension of  host-immunity is a important factor as prevention of both infection. we evaluated the nutritional state of patients with 7 cases of infection group and 13 cases of colonization group. there was no significance between two groups as for serum total protein (mean) were 5.97 g/dl in infection group and 5.96% g/dl in colonization group. furthermore there were significance (p < 0.01) for mean serum albumin (mean) were 3.11 g/dl v.s. 3.27 g/dl. but both serum total protein and serum albumin of these evaluated patients who isolated candida were less than normal limit. therefore we considered nutritional disturbance was important addition to over-use of antibiotics and severe underlying diseases as risk factor of candidiasis, and revealed the importance of improvement of nutritional state at the prevention and therapy.

TI  == in vitro efficacy of antimicrobial-coated bladder catheters in inhibiting bacterial migration along catheter surface.
AB  == most cases of catheter-related urinary tract infection are probably caused by organisms that migrate from the urethral meatus-catheter interface along the external surface of the catheter into the bladder. to examine the ability of bladder catheters coated with minocycline and rifampin to inhibit bacterial migration along the external surface of the catheter, a novel in vitro bladder model was used. compared with uncoated catheters, antimicrobial-coated bladder catheters significantly impeded the migration of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and candida albicans (bacteriuria developed at a mean of 2-5 days vs. 9-34 days, respectively, after bacterial contamination of the catheter). although production of zones of inhibition by coated catheters may provide some protection against infection, there was no correlation between the size of zones of inhibition and level of efficacy in inhibiting bacterial migration in vitro. examination of the clinical  efficacy of these antimicrobial-coated bladder catheters is prudent.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial efficacies of cfc-222, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == cfc-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone containing a c-7 bicyclic amine moiety with potent antibacterial activities against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms. we compared the in vitro and in vivo activities of cfc-222 with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and lomefloxacin. cfc-222 was more active than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive bacteria. cfc-222 was particularly active against streptococcus pneumoniae (mic at which 90% of isolates are inhibited [mic90], 0.2 microg/ml), staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.2 microg/ml for ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains), and enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 0.39 microg/ml). against escherichia coli and other members of the family enterobacteriaceae, cfc-222 was slightly less active than ciprofloxacin (mic90s for e. coli, 0.1 and 0.025 microg/ml, respectively). the in vitro activity of cfc-222 was not influenced by inoculum size, medium composition, or the presence  of horse serum. however, its activity was decreased significantly by a change in  the ph of the medium from 7.0 to 6.0, as was the case for the other quinolones tested. the in vivo protective efficacy of cfc-222 by oral administration was greater than those of the other quinolones tested in a mouse model of intraperitoneally inoculated systemic infection caused by s. aureus. cfc-222 exhibited efficacy comparable to that of ciprofloxacin in the same model of infection caused by gram-negative organisms, such as e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. in this infection model, cfc-222 was slightly less active than ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. these results suggest that cfc-222  may be a promising therapeutic agent in various bacterial infections.

TI  == bacterial killing ability of 10% ethylene oxide plus 90% hydrochlorofluorocarbon  sterilizing gas.
AB  == objectives: to use a serum and salt challenge in narrow-lumen carriers to evaluate a 10% ethylene oxide plus 90% hydrochlorofluorocarbon (eo-hcfc) sterilant mixture in a retrofitted 12/88 sterilizer as an alternative to the banned chlorofluorocarbon-ethylene oxide (eo) sterilant mixture. design: an eo-hcfc sterilizing gas mixture in a retrofitted 12/88 sterilizer was compared to 100% ethylene oxide (100% eo) sterilizing gas to determine its relative ability to kill seven different bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis spores, bacillus stearothermophilus spores, bacillus circulans spores, and mycobacterium chelonei) in the presence or absence of a combined 10% serum and 0.65% salt challenge using both penicylinders (pc) and long narrow-lumen (lu) carriers. results: the eo-hcfc sterilant mixture  (96% sterile carriers) was equivalent to the 100% eo sterilant (98% sterile carriers) for killing vegetative organisms, as well as spore suspensions, on the  27 pc and 27 lu carriers in the absence of serum and salt. in the presence of serum and salt, the eo-hcfc sterilant mixture was markedly better than the 100% eo sterilant at reducing the bacterial load on the 63 pc carriers (95% vs 62% sterile pc carriers, respectively), whereas both sterilizers were equivalent for  the 63 lu carriers (49% vs 40% sterile lu carriers, respectively). of the seven test organisms, e faecalis, b subtilis, b stearothermophilus, and b circulans were the most difficult to kill for both pc and lu carriers when serum and salt were present. conclusions: the data presented in this report indicate that the eo-hcfc sterilant mixture is an effective alternative for gas sterilization. indeed, the efficiency of bacterial killing for the eo-hcfc sterilant mixture was similar to that achieved by the 12/88 eo-cfc sterilant mixture.

TI  == a review of the in vitro activity of meropenem and comparative antimicrobial agents tested against 30,254 aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated world wide.
AB  == the in vitro activity of meropenem (formerly sm-7738), a new carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem and five other broad-spectrum antimicrobials (ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin) against 30,254 clinically significant pathogens isolated in nine countries worldwide. overall, the carbapenems, meropenem and imipenem, were the most active drugs. meropenem was four- to 64-fold more active than imipenem against gram-negative bacteria, including the enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. meropenem was also quite active against ceftazidime-resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting 87.5 to 100% at < or = 4 micrograms/ml. in contrast, imipenem was four- to eight-fold more active than meropenem against  gram-positive species, including methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis. among the anaerobes, strains resistant to meropenem or imipenem were encountered very rarely. these extensive data provide additional in vitro support for the clinical use of meropenem as a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent active against key pathogenic species of bacteria.

TI  == development of an antimicrobial susceptibility testing method suitable for performance during space flight.
AB  == very little is known regarding the effects of the microgravity environment of space flight upon the action of antimicrobial agents on bacterial pathogens. this study was undertaken to develop a simple method for conducting antibacterial susceptibility tests during a space shuttle mission. specially prepared susceptibility test research cards (biomerieux vitek, hazelwood, mo.) were designed to include 6 to 11 serial twofold dilutions of 14 antimicrobial agents,  including penicillins, cephalosporins, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, vancomycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. mics of the drugs were determined by visual reading of color end points in the vitek research cards made possible by incorporation of a colorimetric growth indicator (alamarblue; accumed international, westlake, ohio). this study has demonstrated reproducible susceptibility results in the testing of isolates of staphylococcus aureus, group a streptococcus species, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli (beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains), klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in some instances, the mics were comparable to those determined by a standard broth microdilution method, while in some cases the unique test media and format yielded slightly different values that were themselves reproducible. the proposed in-flight experiment will  include inoculation of the vitek cards on the ground prior to launch of the space shuttle, storage of inoculated cards at refrigeration temperature aboard the space shuttle until experiment initiation, and then incubation of the cards for 18 to 48 h prior to visual interpretation of mics by the mission's astronauts. ground-based studies have shown reproducible mics following storage of inoculated cards for 7 days at 4 to 8 degrees c to accommodate the mission's time schedule and the astronaut's activities. for comparison, ground-based control (normal gravity) mic values will be generated by simultaneous inoculation and incubation  of a second set of test cards in a laboratory at the launch site. this procedure  can provide for a safe and compact experiment that should yield new information on the effects of microgravity on the biological activities of various classes of antibiotics.

(mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus ssp. (mic90s,  0.5 to 8 micrograms/ml). potent ru-59863 activity was also observed against beta-haemolytic and viridans gr. streptococci (mic90s, 0.12-0.5 microgram/ml), streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90s, 0.03 to 0.5 microgram/ml), haemophilus influenzae (mic90, 0.06 microgram/ml), and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mic90, 0.06 micrograms/ml). ru-59863 demonstrated marginal potency against enterococcus faecalis (mics 2 to 16 micrograms/ml) and was inactive against enterococcus faecium (mic90, > 128 micrograms/ml). oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were not  inhibited by ru-59863 (mic90s, 32 to 128 micrograms/ml). among the cephalosporins tested, ru-59863 performed best versus ceftazidime-resistant bush group 1 isolates and strains producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases. ru-59863 was also effective against many fluoroquinolone-, aminoglycoside-, and imipenem-resistant isolates. ru-59863 seems to be a significant advance in cephalosporin chemistry and activity, especially against gram-negative pathogens  resistant to current beta-lactam therapeutic agents. further studies of human pharmacokinetics and against clinical infections are encouraged.

AB  == the in-vitro antibacterial activity of men 10700, a novel penem, has been compared with that of ritipenem, ciprofloxacin, amikacin, cefotaxime and co-amoxiclav against 539 strains taken from 17 genera. men 10700 was most active  against staphylococci and streptococci (mic90 < 0.5 mg/l), slightly less active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., citrobacter spp., moraxella catarrhalis and peptostreptococci (mic90 0.5-2 mg/l), moderately  active against enterococcus faecalis, members of the tribe proteae, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter spp., clostridia and bacteroides spp. (mic90 4-16 mg/l), and inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia  and enterococcus faecium. its antibacterial spectrum is thus slightly less broad  than that of imipenem, but it compares favourably with an oral third-generation cephalosporin. men 10700 was more active than ritipenem against many species, especially enterobacter spp. and citrobacter spp.

TI  == periodontal microflora of hiv infected patients with periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the microbial profile of periodontal lesions in hiv seropositive patients and to compare it with rapidly progressing periodontal lesions in systemically healthy patients. the subgingival microflora  of 20 cdc ii, 20 cdc iii, 20 cdc iv/v and 20 systemically healthy patients with rapidly progressing periodontitis was examined. four sites with greatest probing  depth in each patient were selected for microbiological sampling. the samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. the microflora of periodontitis lesions within the three stages of the hiv infection was similar to that of progressing periodontitis in systemically healthy adults including campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, selenomonas spp. and peptostreptococcus micros. however, hiv seropositive periodontitis lesions harboured a range of exogenous pathogens rarely associated with common types of periodontitis including staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloaca, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus avium, clostridium difficile, aspergillus fumigatus, klebsiella pneumoniae and mycoplasma incognitum. the lack of immune effector and regulatory cells in hiv infected patients could in fact explain the increase of some opportunistic pathogens and the characteristic and rapidly progressing nature of the periodontal disease in these patients.

TI  == [comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1995). iii. differences in susceptibilities from previous years].
AB  == susceptibilities to various antimicrobial agents were examined for enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa that were isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (utis) in 11 hospitals during june, 1995 through may, 1996, and the results were compared with those obtained during the same period in earlier years. 1. macrolide resistant e. faecalis isolated from uncomplicated utis during the latest study period appeared to have increased compared to those in previous  study periods. more than 50% of the isolated e. faecalis during the latest study  period were resistant to macrolide antibiotics, for the first time in our history. 2. no obvious changes were observed through the years for susceptibilities of s. aureus to various antimicrobial agents. vancomycin (vcm) showed the highest activity against s. aureus, with mics below 2 micrograms/ml or below. 3. among e. coli strains, those with low susceptibilities to quinolones appeared to have increased over the years with mic90 changed from between 0.125 microgram/ml or below and 0.5 microgram/ml in the 1989-1990 period to between 8 micrograms/ml and 128 micrograms/ml in the latest study period. 4. klebsiella spp. showed higher resistance to most antimicrobial agents during periods of 1993-1994 and 1994-1995, but somewhat lower resistance during period of 1995-1996. no resistant klebsiella spp. were detected from uncomplicated utis during the latest study period. 5. among p. aeruginosa isolates from complicated  utis, resistance isolates to gentamicin appeared to be increasing over the years. resistant strains to quinolones were isolated at lower frequencies during periods of 1991-1994, but higher frequency was observed in the latest period, and mic50s  were between 0.5 and 4 micrograms/ml during 1991-1994, but were 16-32 micrograms/ml during 1995-1996. these susceptibility changes should be utilized in determining clinical treatments.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of meropenem versus other extended-spectrum antimicrobials against randomly chosen and selected resistant clinical isolates tested in 26 north american centers.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of meropenem and up to nine other antimicrobials was compared in studies at 26 north american centers from 1989 to  1992 with use of standardized and controlled procedures for determining minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) against 12,483 recent clinical isolates and additional drug-resistant strains. overall, carbapenems were the most active drugs. the antibacterial activity of meropenem was consistent against random isolates in all centers; however, inclusion of large proportions of multidrug-resistant gram-negative aerobes by some centers did increase mics of meropenem and the comparators. meropenem was 4-64 times more active than imipenem against gram-negatives, including enterobacteriaceae organisms, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, neisseria meningiditis, and haemophilus influenzae. imipenem was up to 2-4 times more active than meropenem against some  gram-positive cocci, including enterococcus faecalis. carbapenems were similarly  active against anaerobes, and resistant strains were rarely encountered. meropenem, unlike imipenem or ceftazidime, was bactericidal for all strains of enterobacteriaceae, p. aeruginosa, and gram-positive cocci tested at < or = 8 times the mic. a lack of antibiotic cross-resistance was frequently observed between comparator-resistant strains and meropenem. these data suggest the potential utility of meropenem as a monotherapeutic agent against a broad range of pathogens.

AB  == owing to the broad spectrum of activity afforded by beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor preparations, these agents are frequently selected as empiric therapy for the treatment of mixed infections such as intra-abdominal and diabetic foot infections, either alone or in combination with an aminoglycoside. twelve healthy volunteers were enrolled in a randomized, open-label, four-way crossover trial comparing the bactericidal activities of piperacillin-tazobactam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, and ampicillin-sulbactam against microorganisms commonly isolated from mixed infections. subjects received the following regimes: (i) 3.375 g of piperacillin-tazobactam intravenously (i.v.) every 6 h (q6h) (ii) 4.5  g of piperacillin-tazobactam i.v. q8h, (iii) 3.1 g of ticarcillin-clavulanate i.v. q6h, and (iv) 3.0 g of ampicillin-sulbactam i.v. q6h. serum bactericidal titers were determined and used to calculate the duration of measurable bactericidal activity over the dosing interval of each of the regimens against two clinical isolates of bacillus fragilis, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the percentage of the dosing interval over  which drug concentrations in serum remained above the mic for each organism was determined and compared with the observed duration of bactericidal activity was noted (r = 0.78; p < 0.001). all of the regimens demonstrated good activity against b. fragilis and e. coli. against e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa, however,  all of the regimens provided bactericidal activity for less than 50% of the respective dosing intervals. these data suggest that use of shorter dosing intervals or continuous-infusion regimens should be considered in combination with an aminoglycoside to improve the bactericidal profiles of these agents for e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == high incidence of antibiotic resistance among bacteria in 4 intensive care units  at a university hospital in sweden.
AB  == the frequency of antibiotic resistance among bacteria in 4 intensive care units (icus) at a university hospital in sweden was investigated annually from 1993 to  1996. an increase in ampicillin-resistant enterococci from 1993 to 1995 was seen  which was due to a shift from enterococcus faecalis to enterococcus faecium. after a special infection control programme was instituted, the rate of ampicillin resistance among enterococci and the number of e. faecium isolates declined during 1996. the oxacillin resistance rates for staphylococcus aureus were < or = 2%, while most of the coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) were oxacillin resistant. no vancomycin-resistant enterococci or staphylococci were seen. the ciprofloxacin resistance rate for cns and enterococci spp. were high. relatively, high levels of resistance to cefotaxime and piperacillin/tazobactam among enterobacter spp. were also seen. during 1995 and 1996 pseudomonas aeruginosa showed increasing resistance to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam. this was due to an outbreak among rather few patients. the overall resistance rates for gram-negative bacteria were low for aminoglycosides and imipenem. from 1993 to 1996 the total antibiotic consumption  decreased by 27% in the whole hospital and 16.5% in the icus. however, the reduced antibiotic consumption was paralleled with a 23% decrease in the total number of patients treated in the hospital from 1993 to 1996. in contrast there was an 11.5% increase in the number of icu patients treated during this period. the conclusion is that all icus within a hospital should have a programme for 'on-line' antibiotic resistance surveillance of drugs used in that unit in order  to change the empiric treatment when there is an increase in antibiotic resistance. it is also important to survey the antibiotic consumption in the icus in order to avoid further selective pressure on bacteria showing increased resistance rates.

AB  == abt-719 is a 2-pyridone antimicrobial which inhibits dna gyrase activity. it has  considerable subcutaneous (sc) and oral efficacy in the treatment of experimental pyelonephritis induced in carrageenan-treated mice by clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. therapeutic ed50s, defined here as producing a 2 log10 reduction in kidney bacterial burden, provide a reliable end point for comparison of drug efficacy in this experimental infection. therapeutic ed50s for abt-719 against these infections were equal to or up to ten-fold lower than those for ciprofloxacin, used as a reference because of similarity in mode of action. against e. faecalis, the therapeutic ed50s for abt-719 were 4.5-13.6 mg/kg.day for sc administration and 6.8-8.9 mg/kg.day for oral administration. abt-719 was  more potent than ciprofloxacin and vancomycin against the e. faecalis strains, which showed ciprofloxacin and vancomycin resistance covering a range of mics. against e. faecium, the therapeutic ed50s for abt-719 were 8.8 mg/kg.day (sc) and 9.4 mg/kg.day (oral). against an isolate of e. faecium showing ciprofloxacin and  vancomycin resistance the ed50 for abt-719 to achieve a 1 log10 reduction in kidney bacterial burden was 17.9 mg/kg.day by sc administration. while abt-719 had lower efficacy against this isolate than against others, ciprofloxacin and vancomycin failed to show efficacy. against e. coli, the therapeutic ed50 for abt-719 was 1.1 mg/kg.day (oral), and against p. aeruginosa, this value was 2.7 mg/kg.day (oral) with values against both of these pathogens similar to those for ciprofloxacin. abt-719, which represents the new 2-pyridone compound class, has promise for the treatment of urinary tract infections, as suggested by the significant efficacy seen against experimental pyelonephritis caused by e. coli,  p. aeruginosa and susceptible and resistant enterococci.

AB  == the regulation of intracellular concentrations of organic solutes, including glycine betaine, is an important adaptive response to osmotic stress for escherichia coli. the clinical significance of glycine betaine to uropathogens is not clear. clinical isolates of e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, s. saprophyticus, and enterococcus faecalis accumulated glycine betaine from hyperosmotic media. the addition of glycine betaine to hyperosmotic minimal medium accelerated the growth rates of all species tested except p. mirabilis. however, when clinical strains of e. coli were transferred from urine with low osmolality to hyperosmotic urine, there was no slowing of the growth rate. there  was no difference in growth rates of e. coli isolates from acute pyelonephritis,  cystitis, and asymptomatic bacteriuria nor from fecal isolates. the ability to accumulate osmolytes, although it may be a factor in the adaptation to hypertonic environments, was not related to virulence.

TI  == regulation of the immune response by dehydroepiandrosterone and its metabolites.
AB  == dehydroepiandrosterone (5-androsten-3 beta-ol-17-one, dhea) has been shown to protect mice from a variety of lethal infections. this includes, but is not limited to, infection with viruses (herpes virus type 2, coxsackie virus b4 (cb4)), bacteria (enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa), and a parasite  (cryptosporidium parvum). we have previously reported that androstenediol (5-androstene-3 beta, 17 beta-diol, aed), derived from dhea, is at least 100 x more effective in up-regulating systemic resistance against cb4 infection than its precursor. furthermore, androstenetriol (5-androstene-3 beta,7 beta, 17 beta-triol, aet) which is formed by 7 beta hydroxylation of aed, was more effective against cb4 infection than its precursor, aed. neither steroid, however, has shown any significant direct antiviral effects. the in vitro influences of dhea, aed and aet on a mitogen-induced mixed splenocyte proliferation assay were determined. the results showed that dhea suppressed the  proliferation of concanavalin a (cona)- or lipopolysaccharide-activated cultures  in a dose-dependent manner. aed had little influence on the activation response.  however, aet potentiated the response to both mitogens significantly above the control level. the regulation of interleukin (il)-2 and il-3 secretion from cona-activated lymphocytes was analogous to these observations. these functions were depressed by dhea, unaffected by aed, and potently increased by aet. moreover, the classic immunosuppressive effects of hydrocortisone on cona-induced lymphocyte proliferation, as well as il-2 and il-3 production, were unaffected by co-culture with dhea and only minimally counteracted by aed. in contrast. aet significantly counteracted the effect of hydrocortisone when co-cultured together. these data show that while dhea, aed and aet each function in a similar manner in vivo, in vitro their effects are dramatically different from one another with only aet potentiating the cellular response by increasing lymphocyte activation and counteracting the immunosuppressive activity of hydrocortisone.

AB  == a microbial culture collection composed of 1820 bacterial strains, including 298  actinomycete strains, was established from the roots of douglas-fir (pseudotsuga  menziesii (mirb.) franco) seedlings harvested from conifer nurseries and forest sites. two hundred and thirty-four strains inhibited the growth of fusarium, cylindrocarpon, and (or) pythium spp. in in vitro assays. a significantly greater proportion of bacterial strains from actinomycete genera exhibited antifungal properties compared with bacterial strains from nonactinomycete genera. eighty-nine percent of identified inhibitory strains were streptomyces, streptoverticillium, bacillus, pseudomonas, or burkholderia species. the actinomycete species were isolated almost exclusively from forest seedlings. recovery of inhibitory strains representing 29 microbial species was enhanced using a variety of methods to isolate microorganisms from the roots of seedlings  from nursery and forest sites. bacterial strains (including actinomycete strains) with antifungal activity were tested for in vitro growth inhibition of six clinical human bacterial pathogens (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). forty-eight percent of the tested strains inhibited one or more human pathogens, inhibitory activity towards fungal and bacterial pathogens was strain specific, not species specific, and many inhibitory strains exhibited broad-spectrum activity. strains with antifungal activity against several conifer root pathogens were also more likely to inhibit multiple species of clinical bacterial pathogens.

AB  == objective: the performance of a standard gas sterilizer, which uses a mixture of  12% ethylene oxide (eto) and 88% chlorofluorocarbon as the sterilizing gas (12/88), was compared to selected gas, ion plasma, and vaporized hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) sterilizers that do not use chlorofluorocarbons. the effect of serum and salt on sterilizer performance was evaluated. design: test carriers (porcelain and stainless steel penicylinders, or 125-cm lengths of plastic tubing [internal diameter of 3.2 mm]) were inoculated with escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, mycobacterium chelonei, bacillus stearothermophilus spores, bacillus subtilis spores, and bacillus circulans spores and then subjected to sterilization using 12/88, 100% eto, ion plasma, or  vaporized h2o2. the bacterial inoculum was prepared with and without 10% serum and 0.65% salt, and the residual bacterial load after sterilization as determined using viable counts. results: all of the sterilizers tested effected a six-log10  reduction of the bacterial inoculum on penicylinders, unless 10% serum and 0.65%  salt were present, in which case the 100% eto, vaporized h2o2, and ion plasma sterilizers were not as effective as the 12/88 sterilizer. none of the sterilizers could eradicate 10(6) cfu of all of the bacteria in 10% serum and 0.65% salt when inoculated inside a narrow lumen. conclusions: the margin of safety for the 100% eto, vaporized h2o2, and ion plasma sterilizers is less than  that of the 12/88 sterilizer. the inability of all sterilizers, including the 12/88, to kill organisms in narrow lumens reliably when serum and salt were present raises concern about the current practice of gas sterilization of flexible endoscopes.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == a one-year survey of respiratory and urinary pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  == a one-year (1993) survey of the distribution of pathogens causing respiratory and urinary infections and their antimicrobial susceptibility was performed. the most common bacteria isolated from the lower respiratory tract of patients in a district general hospital were pseudomonas aeruginosa (35.9%) and staphylococcus  aureus (21.4%). about half of the pseudomonas strains revealed a resistance to imipenem and gentamicin, whereas almost all staphylococcus strains were resistant to penicillin g. the most common isolates from urine of in and out-patients were  escherichia coli (32.3% and 39.8%) and enterococcus faecalis (16.6% and 14.2%). escherichia coli strains were largely susceptible to almost all chemoantibiotics  tested, whereas enterococcus faecalis demonstrated a high resistance pattern. pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from urine were more sensitive to chemoantibiotics than respiratory strains and the susceptibility of staphylococcus aureus isolated from hospitalized or out-patients was different. a periodic monitoring system devised to give information about the circulation of bacteria and the chemoantibiotic resistance in a local context would be useful to assess the local trends and select drugs for therapy.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and biocompatibility of polyurethane and silicone catheters containing low concentrations of silver: a new perspective in prevention of polymer-associated foreign-body-infections.
AB  == in modern medicine, infection is one of the most serious complications of implanted plastic devices. the host is not able to overcome this special type of  opportunistic infection despite having a normal immune response and a low virulence of most of the bacteria involved. antimicrobial therapy alone generally cannot cure the infection and the removal of catheters often remains the only choice of therapy. bacterial adhesion to the polymer surface of the catheter, be  it luminal or external, is an important step in the pathogenesis of catheter-associated infections. in this report, we describe new approaches to the prevention of infections by impregnation of polyurethane and silicone with silver by two different methods. the antimicrobial activity of these silver-impregnated  catheters is more than 10 fold higher for coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns)  compared to catheters without silver. similar results are obtained with other microbial organisms like staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. the new polymers show no cytotoxic or thrombogenic side effects in vitro.

TI  == structure-activity relationship of new 2-substituted penem antibiotics.
AB  == the antibacterial activities of three new penems with 4-hydroxyprolinamide, 1-prolinamide and n-methyl-n-2-propionamide substituents, respectively, in position 2 and of their stereoisomers were examined against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. all substitutes conferred a broad antibacterial spectrum  on the penem moiety. changes in stereoisomerism selectively improved the activity against e. coli, s. aureus or enterococci. the structure-activity relationships of each compound were discussed in relation to minimum inhibitory concentrations, penicillin-binding protein (pbp) affinity and outer membrane permeability coefficient in e. coli. in this microorganism, pbp 2 was the target for all compounds. changes in stereoisomerism influenced the affinity for pbps 1a/b and 2. all antibiotics easily permeated the outer membrane of e. coli and, within each group of compounds, the penetration rate correlated with the antibacterial activity.

TI  == nosocomial bacteremia-induced increases in abscess formation correlate with in vitro upregulation of macrophage procoagulant activity.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the hypothesis that sublethal exposure to common nosocomial pathogens can alter the host response to a later, distant infectious insult (peritonitis and intraperitoneal abscess formation), and that these changes are related to the induction of macrophage procoagulant activity. design: a multiexperiment, randomized, controlled trial. setting: animal research laboratory of a university medical center. subjects: one hundred sixty-five balb/c mice, weighing 20 to 25 g, were used for in vivo experiments and as the source of peritoneal macrophages for in vitro experiments. interventions: nine groups of mice (n = 10 to 18 per group) were twice systemically preexposed to sublethal amounts of live escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, or candida albicans, or to 2.5 or 5.0 micrograms e. coli lipopolysaccharide o26:b6. one week later, mice underwent the induction of mixed e. coli/bacteroides fragilis peritonitis, leading to abscess formation. in parallel experiments in vitro, 10(6) mouse peritoneal macrophages were incubated with similar amounts of nosocomial pathogens or lipopolysaccharide to determine the induction of macrophage procoagulant activity. measurements and main results: the three gram-negative bacilli tested significantly upregulated both abscess formation and macrophage procoagulant activity, with a strong linear correlation between abscess formation and procoagulant activity. these effects were not seen with the gram-positive cocci or with c. albicans. pre-exposure of mice to endotoxin alone  did not alter later abscess formation, but did increase macrophage procoagulant activity. conclusions: sublethal exposure to some gram-negative nosocomial pathogens can significantly alter a host's response to a later, distant, infection, even when caused by different bacteria. in the case of peritonitis and intraperitoneal abscess formation, these changes may be mediated by the upregulation of macrophage procoagulant activity. the presence of endotoxin alone does not completely explain these phenomena.

AB  == we typed 39 sets of multiple bacterial isolates of the same species from patients by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of genomic dna (pfge). isolates were cultured from different sites or over a 2-week or longer interval. staphylococcus aureus,  enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae were tested. excluding e. cloacae, 28 of 32  sets of isolates (87%) demonstrated only identical or highly related pfge types.  four of the seven sets of e. cloacae showed different types. for species other than e. cloacae, our results suggest that patients are usually colonized and infected with a single strain of these bacterial pathogens. unlike all of the other tested species, e. cloacae pfge typing differences suggested the presence of multiple strains causing colonization and infection.

TI  == emergence of bacterial resistance to imipenem and ciprofloxacin in a university hospital.
AB  == we have continuously monitored the in-vitro activities of imipenem and ciprofloxacin against large numbers of non-fastidious clinical isolates. after eight years of use, 97-100% of enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter baumannii remained susceptible to imipenem, but susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa declined from 100% to 91%. after six years of use, 94%-100% of enterobacteriaceae (except providencia stuartii) remained susceptible to ciprofloxacin but susceptibility of p. stuartii, a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa declined from 100%  to 46%, 66% and 84%, respectively. oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were considered to be resistant to imipenem and all beta-lactams. there were no quinolone-resistant staphylococci observed in 1986, but susceptibilities of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus to ciprofloxacin decreased to 85-93% for oxacillin-susceptible strains and to 7-39% for oxacillin-resistant strains. enterococcus faecalis has remained susceptible to imipenem and the modal mic of ciprofloxacin has remained 1 mg/l; however, susceptibility to ciprofloxacin 2 mg/l decreased from 94% to 64%. imipenem-quinolone cross-resistance was observed for staphylococci but not for p. aeruginosa.

TI  == bactericidal activity of copper and noncopper paints.
AB  == objective: to screen copper and noncopper paints for their bactericidal effectiveness in rendering surfaces self-disinfecting. design: tested paints were applied to glass coverslips, cured, inoculated with test organisms (staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococcus faecalis), and dried. after 0, 24, or 48 hours, surviving organisms  were eluted and enumerated, and counts compared with those obtained from inoculated control (unpainted) coverslips for the corresponding time periods. copper elution from select copper paints was quantified by complete immersion of  coated coverslips followed by spectroscopic analysis to infer a threshold relationship between kill and copper release. results: nearly all of the tested copper paints were capable of reducing organism counts to negligible levels within 24 hours. exterior latex paints supplemented with a fungicide were similarly efficacious. standard interior latex paint reduced bacterial counts to  nearly zero within 24 hours for e coli and p aeruginosa, and to zero within 48 hours for e faecalis. however, substantial survival of s aureus occurred (up to 4 logs at 24 hours). chi-squared analysis of elution and cidal data indicated that  lethality was dependent on copper release in excess of 32 micrograms. conclusion: the data support presumptive bactericidal claims for several copper and noncopper paints. despite controversy over environment-based contagion, such paints could be used to render surfaces self-disinfecting in strategic locations where environmental causation of nosocomial infections is suspected.

TI  == synthesis and antibacterial activity of some novel 1-substituted 1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-pyridinyl-3-quinolinecarboxylic acids. potent antistaphylococcal agents.
AB  == the palladium-catalyzed coupling of 3- and 4-(trialkylstannyl)pyridines with 7-bromo or 7-chloro 1-substituted 1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylates has provided access to the corresponding 1-substituted 1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-pyridinyl-3-quinolinecarboxylic acids. the antibacterial activity of these derivatives was studied with the finding that the optimal 1- and 7-position substituents for gram positive activity are cyclopropyl and 4-(2,6-dimethylpyridinyl), respectively. we find that for the fluorine-substituted derivatives studied, the position of the fluorine on the quinolone nucleus or the number of fluorine atoms does not seem to be important for good gram positive activity. for 1-cyclopropyl 7-(2,6-dimethyl-4-pyridinyl) derivatives, the 6-fluoro 4a, 8-fluoro 10d, 6,8-difluoro 10b, and 5,6,8-trifluoro 8, all provided equal antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213. there is also a correlation between the substitution on the 7-(4-pyridinyl) group and the gram positive activity, particularly for s. aureus, clearly indicating that the 2,6-dimethylpyridinyl group is optimal. the mic50 value for the most potent agents in this study against s. aureus atcc 29213 is 0.008 microgram/ml. by comparison, ciprofloxacin and aminopyrrolidine 28 gave values of 0.25 and 0.015 microgram/ml, respectively, against this organism.

AB  == the in vitro efficacy of ceftriaxone plus amikacin combination against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, clinically isolated from patients affected by pneumonia in intensive care units, was compared to that of the 2 drugs used alone. the study was performed using a dynamic model in which the human kinetics of the drugs after intramuscular administration was simulated. the antibacterial activity was tested by determining the bacterial cell count (cfu/ml). killing curves came out from plotting the log cfu/ml versus time. in the same way, ceftriaxone and amikacin concentrations were assayed by hplc and fluorescence polarization immunoassay, respectively. the results show that ceftriaxone plus amikacin combination exert a high killing activity against all tested strains. the two antibiotics alone initially have a good killing activity  but this is followed by bacterial regrowth for all tested isolates. this data supports the results of several clinical studies which have shown a good therapeutic efficacy of ceftriaxone plus amikacin combination in the treatment of severe infections caused by organisms intermediately sensitive to these drugs.

TI  == rapid identification of common human pathogens by high-resolution proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
AB  == routine procedures for recovery of bacteria from clinical specimens involve culturing the latter on various nonselective and selective agar media. the bacteria are then identified by means of biochemical and immunological test procedures. reduction of the time required to identify the bacteria is highly desirable for rapid clinical diagnosis. towards this end the potential of proton  nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy for providing a "fingerprint" within the proton spectrum of five bacterial genera, reflecting their characteristic cell wall constituents, has been investigated. establishing a database of high-resolution proton nmr spectra of a large number of bacterial species is a prerequisite for attaining this objective. a database has been established for five common human pathogens: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. on the basis of the presence of characteristic resonances in their spectra, a simple algorithm has been developed to differentiate and identify these microorganisms. the nmr spectra of e. coli and s. aureus showed no dependency on the type of growth medium, growth density, or incubation time.

AB  == the prevalence and antibiotic sensitivity patterns of bacteria collected consecutively from medical and surgical intensive care units (icus) and from hematology/oncology units in nine hospitals in denmark were determined and compared to data collected simultaneously in 12 other european countries. bacterial isolates from 794 danish patients were tested and compared to 8,625 isolates from european patients. the minimal inhibitory concentrations of eight different antibiotics were determined using a microdilution plate. similar to findings in european countries, the most common source of bacterial isolates in danish units was the respiratory tract (49%), followed by blood (18%), urinary tract (14%) and surgical wounds (10%). staphylococcus aureus was the most prevalent respiratory organism in danish units, whereas enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa dominated in other countries. in blood, escherichia coli was most prevalent in denmark while coagulase-negative staphylococci were predominant in other countries. urinary tract isolates were dominated by escherichia coli in both denmark and the other countries, but enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa were more frequently isolated in the other countries. staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent wound isolate in denmark,  while enterobacteriaceae other than escherichia coli dominated in other european  countries. thus, in denmark escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus, followed  by pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella spp. (from icus) or enterococcus spp. and klebsiella spp. (from hematology/oncology units), are the most prominent pathogens in these units today. indicator organisms of antibiotic consumption (pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus) were more frequent in other european countries than denmark. in general the danish isolates were more sensitive to antibiotics than the european isolates.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == objective: the in vitro activity of apalcillin plus ro 48-1220, a novel penam sulfone beta-lactamase inhibitor, was compared with apalcillin alone, piperacillin/tazobactam, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, imipenem, ceftazidime and cefepime. methods: agar dilution and broth microdilution testing of 854 bacterial strains, subcultured from frozen stocks incubated for 24 h in 5% carbon dioxide, was carried out to determine the minimum bactericidal (mbc) and minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of each of the study drugs in accordance with the nccls m26-t method. results: apalcillin/ro 48-1220 was active against all gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates except klebsiella oxytoca (mic90 32 microg/ml). among the enterobacteriaceae, synergy for apalcillin/ro 48-1220 (4 microg/ml fixed concentration) vs apalcillin alone was demonstrated for nearly all species when comparing mic90 results. apalcillin/ro 48-1220 was highly potent against beta-lactamase-producing moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mics less-than-or-equal 1 microg/ml). however, much of this activity was due to the direct antimicrobial action of ro 48-1220 alone (mics less-than-or-equal 4 microg/ml). all pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia and acinetobacter species were inhibited by apalcillin/ro 48-1220 (mic90 0.25 to 4 microg/ml). for the aerobic gram-positive organisms, none of the drugs tested were consistently effective against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, corynebacterium jeikeium and enterococcus species other than e. faecalis. apalcillin/ro 48-1220 was as effective as piperacillin/tazobactam against escherichia coli producing extended-spectrum tem enzymes, but less active against isolates producing shv-type beta-lactamases. when tested against 204 ceftazidime-, gentamicin- or fluoroquinolone-resistant organisms, 78%, 91% and 66% of strains, respectively, were susceptible to apalcillin/ro 48-1220 (less-than-or-equal 16 microg/ml). conclusions: apalcillin/ro 48-1220 is bactericidal with a modest inoculum effect; its wide spectrum of activity favors  continued studies of spectrum, pharmacokinetics and in vivo efficacy.

TI  == synthesis and biological properties of a series of optically active 2-oxaisocephems.
AB  == a novel series of (6s, 7s)-3,7-disubstituted-8-oxo-1-aza-4-oxabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2- carboxylic acids 9a-o, parenteral optically active 2-oxaisocephems, was synthesized, and in  vitro and in vivo activities were determined against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the 7-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(z)-cyclopentyloxyimino]acet arnido derivatives, 9g, 9m and 9o, had enhanced antibacterial activity against gram-positive organisms including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococcus faecalis while maintaining gram-negative activity. it is also significant that these compounds showed more potent activity against mrsa and e. faecalis isolates than cefuzonam (10) and flomoxef (12), which are the most popular third-generation antibiotics. the combination of the 7-[2-(aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(z)-cyclopentyloxyimino]acetamido group and 2-oxaisocephem nucleus contributes to the increased antibacterial activity against these clinical isolates. the 7-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(z)-cyclopentyloxyimino]acet ami do derivative 9g provided good subcutaneous efficacy and exhibited more potent activity than cefmenoxime (11) against the systemic infection with s. aureus smith in mice. the compound 9a with a [2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(z)-methoxyimino]acetamido group at the 7-position showed high in vivo efficacy on the experimental infection caused  by escherichia coli no. 29 in mice.

TI  == the effects of x-ray contrast media on bacterial growth.
AB  == six widely used x-ray contrast media (xrc) were tested against nine commonly isolated organisms to determine the practicality of using xrc to outline body spaces prior to obtaining specimens for culture and to assess the feasibility of  using xrc in divided doses to reduce cost. preparations of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus milleri in two approximate concentrations of 10(4) and 10(8) colony forming units/ml (cfu/ml) were inoculated into the following xrc: conray 280, hexabrix 320, lopamiro 370, omnipaque 350, ultravist 300 and optiray 320 each in two concentrations. sampling was performed in triplicate at 0, 2, 4 and 20 h with the 20 h counts made after exposure at both 22 degrees c and 4 degrees c. there were 16 significant interactions, predominantly with the gram-negative organisms. conray 280 produced the greatest number of effects. most effects were bacteriostatic. organisms were  most susceptible at low concentration and after prolonged contact with xrc. no effect was seen with dilute xrc. all weekly sterility checks were negative. non-ionic xrc have no significant effect on the growth of gram-positive organisms and little effect on gram-negative organisms if processing is performed promptly. using standard aseptic technique, no contamination of xrc occurred, suggesting multi-dosing may be a safe and cost-effective method of xrc utilization.

TI  == antibacterial effect of substituted 4-quinazolyl-hydrazines and their arylhydrazones determined by a modified microdilution method.
AB  == eight 4-quinazolylhydrazines and eleven their arylhydrazones have been tested for antibacterial effects and for structure-activity relationships by a modified microdilution method. the derivative 6-chloro-2-morpholino-4-quinazolyl-5'-nitro-2'-furylhydrazone++ + had the highest antibacterial effect, the mic values being 100 mg/l for e. faecalis, 250 mg/l for s. aureus, 200 mg/l for p. aeruginosa and 350 mg/l for e. coli. the most effective derivatives were those with the benzene ring substituted with chlorine  or methyl group in position 6 or 8 and with pyrimidine ring substituted with a secondary amine in position 2. the modified microdilution method did not give rise to any statistically significant deviations in the mic values for ampicillin in comparison with reported reference collection values.

TI  == growth conditions influence expression of cell surface hydrophobicity of staphylococci and other wound infection pathogens.
AB  == the initial adhesion of microbes to tissue and solid surfaces can be mediated by  hydrophobic interaction. expression of microbial cell surface hydrophobicity (csh) is influenced by growth conditions, and often best expressed after growth under nutrient-poor conditions, or "starvation". in the present study, the csh of 133 strains of enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, group a streptococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, peptococcus magnus, and of 8 candida albicans strains was measured by the salt aggregation test after growth on hematin agar in a 5% co2 atmosphere, or under anaerobiosis. cells of all but 8 strains expressed pronounced or moderate csh, i.e., they aggregated in  0.01-2 m ammonium sulfate. when the agar surface was covered by human serum (diluted 1:5) to mimic growth conditions in a wound, 94 strains expressed higher  csh, and 44 strains the same csh as after growth without serum. the csh of 12 strains of different species was measured after growth on blood, hematin and pdm  agar, with or without serum, and in an aerobic or a 5% co2 atmosphere. the highest csh was expressed after growth in 5% co2 with serum, and the lowest growth after on blood agar in aerobic atmosphere. identical results were obtained with native and heat-inactivated (56 c, 20 min) serum. the reduced surface tension obtained in 5% co2, as well as yet unidentified serum factors, promotes expression of csh.

TI  == effects of silver on adherence of bacteria to urinary catheters: in vitro studies.
AB  == strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, and klebsiella pneumoniae, mostly from complicated urinary tract infections, showed reduced adherence to silver-treated silicone or latex catheters as compared with latex or silicone catheters. the relative degrees of cell adherence to catheters at 2 h or 18 h, as indicated by radiolabeled cell assays, were in general agreement with growth rate-reduction assays and scanning-electron-microscopy data. for strains of e. coli, the correlation between cell hydrophobicity and degree of adherence to catheters was not significant. antibiotic resistance (tetracycline, sulfathiazine, neomycin, kanamycin) and silver resistance were not associated. the radiolabel adherence procedure provided a quantitative method for evaluating the relative antimicrobial efficacy of silver-treated catheters.

TI  == the microbial flora in venous leg ulcers without clinical signs of infection. repeated culture using a validated standardised microbiological technique.
AB  == the change of ulcer size in relation to the presence of species and quantities of microorganisms was analysed in 58 patients with venous leg ulcers, all without clinical signs of infection. microbiological samples were taken on the day of inclusion and then repeated 4 times at monthly intervals or until the ulcer had healed or was too small to be cultured from. there was growth of microorganisms in all ulcers, and the numbers were below 10(4) per mm2 of ulcer surface in all cases. no correlation was found between ulcer size change and the species and amounts of microorganisms. sixty-nine species were isolated. staphylococcus aureus was found in 88%, enterococcus faecalis in 74%, enterobacter cloacae and peptococcus magnus in 29%, and fungi in 11% of the samples. one or more obligate  anaerobe species was found in 41% of the samples and in half of the ulcers and constituted 62% of all bacterial species. the colonising ulcer flora was markedly constant over time in the individual ulcers regardless of change in size. resident bacterial species were found in 57 of the 58 ulcers. if all samples were considered, the microorganisms were associated with not more than one fifth of the variability in healing rate, as shown by linear multiple regression analysis. the same species of microorganisms were found in ulcers that decreased (or healed) and in those that increased in size. although an association between the  microorganisms and ulcer healing could not be ruled out in this study, there seems to be no indication for routinely performed culture in the absence of clinical signs of infection in venous leg ulcers.

TI  == [etiologic structure of infectious complications in the urogenital tract of oncologic patients].
AB  == the investigation of the microflora of infectious complications in the urogenital tract of oncological patients showed that in spite of the similarity of the microbiotypes, the microflora of the infectious complications in the patients had marked differences. the causative agents in urological patients were mainly monocultures (69.9 per cent), whereas in gynecological patients they were mainly  associations (67.2 per cent), more frequently of 2 and sometimes of 3 and even 4  or 5 taxa. the taxonomic spectra of such pathogens were also different. in the urological patients a much broader spectrum of the bacterial species with the predominance of gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria was detected. in the gynecological patients the predominating taxa were candida spp., staphylococcus spp., escherichia coli and s. faecalis. the other bacteria in total amounted to 13.9 per cent. in the urological patients the predominating taxa were pseudomonas aeruginosa, e. coli, candida spp. and s. faecalis. the frequency of staphylococcus spp. and candida spp. was twice as low as that in the gynecological patients. therefore, the comparative investigation of the causative agents in the urinary tract and female genitalia of the oncological patients revealed significant differences which cast doubt on the validity of empirical antibacterial therapy according to the principle of "above and below the waist" practiced by many physicians in the treatment of infectious complications in somatic hospitals.

TI  == pacemaker endocarditis. report of 44 cases and review of the literature.
AB  == we conducted a retrospective study to characterize the clinical course, microbiologic spectrum, and risk factors for endocarditis and for associated mortality in a large series of patients with documented pacemaker endocarditis. using a computerized search through the medical records of 10 major hospitals in  israel from 1982 to 1992, and carefully reviewing the charts, we identified 44 patients with pacemaker endocarditis. the cases were categorized as definite (n = 25), probable (n = 12), or possible (n = 7) infective endocarditis based on strict case definition. fever and chills were the most common symptoms. increased esr, leukocytosis, microscopic hematuria, and anemia were the most common laboratory findings. a relatively high proportion of the patients were diabetic.  the most common source of endocarditis was infection acquired by the placement procedure or infection of the pacemaker pouch. demographic, clinical, and laboratory features were similar to those of endocarditis patients of a similar age range without pacemakers, although the frequency of fever and chills was higher in our patients than in those patients and splenomegaly, vascular embolic  phenomena, and new or changing murmurs were rare in our patients. the major pathogens were staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, similar to other series of pacemaker-associated bacteremia and similar to the microbiologic  findings of early prosthetic-valve endocarditis. however, this microbiologic profile is different from that of native-valve endocarditis. although the present series did not show a statistically significant advantage to electrode removal over conservative treatment, when analyzed together with pooled data from other studies, it suggests that the surgical approach is preferable.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == prediction of piperacillin-tazobactam susceptibility among enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other bacteria using ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, and other broad-spectrum antimicrobial in vitro test results.
AB  == the ability of various in vitro beta-lactam susceptibility test results to predict the susceptibility of piperacillin-tazobactam (a new beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combination) was assessed using more than 46,000 recent clinical isolates. the organisms were tested by reference-quality national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) broth microdilution  procedures and interpreted by the currently published nccls criteria. the recommended antimicrobial tests that would accurately predict the piperacillin-tazobactam in vitro efficacy had an overall very major, false-susceptible rate of only 0.6% (< or = 1.5% is acceptable). the following drug tests can be used to judge piperacillin-tazobactam activity and spectrum (low patient risk) conservatively: for enterobacteriaceae use ticarcillin-clavulanic acid results (0.6% very major error); for pseudomonas aeruginosa use piperacillin (0.1%) results; for enterococci use ampicillin or ampicillin-sulbactam (1.8%) results; for haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis use cefotaxime or cefuroxime or ceftriaxone (1.5%); and for staphylococci use oxacillin by nccls recommendations. when the piperacillin-tazobactam testing reagents become available, the direct testing of  this combination should be applied to relevant clinical isolates. the piperacillin-tazobactam break points should be reassessed as indicated by the cited minimum inhibitory concentration population analysis to improve predictive  accuracy; h. influenzae susceptibility modified to < or = 2/4 micrograms/ml and enterococcus species susceptibility tested at < or = 16/4 micrograms.

AB  == mixed urinary tract infection was caused by simultaneous inoculation of 10(4) cfu each of enterococcus faecalis tn2005 and pseudomonas aeruginosa p9 into the bladders of cba/j mice. both organisms proliferated in the kidneys, and viable cell counts of e. faecalis tn2005 reached a peak level of 4.1 x 10(5) cfu per pair of kidneys within the first 24 h, while p. aeruginosa p9 counts increased more slowly. the number of p. aeruginosa p9 cells peaked at 8.3 x 10(6) cfu per pair of kidneys 5 days after infection. five days after mixed infection, infiltration of neutrophils into the renal pelvis and renal medulla was observed. immunohistochemical staining revealed the presence of e. faecalis antigen in the  renal medulla. p. aeruginosa antigen was detected mainly in the renal pelvis 5 days after infection and in the renal medulla as well as the renal pelvis 14 days after infection. mixed infection induced pyelonephritis within 5 days after mixed infection, while it was not observed until 14 days after infection with p. aeruginosa p9 alone. p. aeruginosa p9 inoculated together with e. faecalis tn2005 was more resistant to eradication from the kidneys by beta-lactam antibiotics than p. aeruginosa p9 inoculated alone. these results suggest that e. faecalis tn2005 invades the renal medulla first in mixed urinary tract infection and induces histological changes which lead to aggravation of the pyelonephritis caused by p. aeruginosa p9.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of sy5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. sy5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, morganella morganii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, clostridium spp., and bacteroides fragilis. against providencia spp., proteus spp., and haemophilus influenzae, sy5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. sy5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. enterococcus faecium, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. the bactericidal activities of sy5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the mics for clinical isolates of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. sy5555  was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. however, sy5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by x. maltophilia (l-1) and p. aeruginosa/pms354 beta-lactamases, two bush group 3 beta-lactamases, sy5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from  c. freundii gn7391 and e. cloacae gn7471 strains. these results suggest that sy5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == catheter related bacterial infections mimic reactions to exogenous pyrogens during hemodialysis.
AB  == pyrogenic reactions are characterized by fever, chills, hypotension, or a combination of these developing during or shortly after hemodialysis in a previously asymptomatic patient. the temporal association with treatment implicates exposure of the patient's blood to bacterial pyrogens from contaminated dialysate or a reused dialyzer. routine body temperature monitoring  is recommended to detect these exposures. the current study was prompted by the appearance of several symptomatic febrile episodes in patients who were asymptomatic and afebrile before treatment with high-flux hemodialysis. during a  6 month period, temperatures were measured with a digital oral thermometer before and after 9,605 high-flux hemodialyses in 163 patients. elevations above 100 degrees f (37.8 degrees c) were observed during or after 33 dialyses in 15 patients. in 18 of these dialyses, the temperature was also elevated before treatment began. four patients who had no symptoms or fever before dialysis accounted for febrile reactions during 11 of the remaining 15 dialysis treatments. fever was accompanied by rigors during most of the episodes. subsequent blood cultures grew enterococcus faecalis (two), enterobacter cloacae  (two), and pseudomonas aeruginosa and cepacia (one). all four patients had indwelling silastic double lumen venous catheters (permcaths), all responded to intravenous antibiotics, and all required eventual removal of the catheter. the apparent precipitation of sepsis by dialysis indicates that shear forces caused by high pulsatile blood flow through the catheter may dislodge organisms that have colonized the lumen. intraluminal instillation of antibiotics is suggested as a preventative measure.

TI  == the stomach is not a source for colonization of the upper respiratory tract and pneumonia in icu patients.
AB  == study objective: to study sequences of colonization of different species of microorganisms and to determine the importance of gastric colonization for the development of nosocomial pneumonia. design: a prospective study. setting: two identical icus of a university hospital. patients: sixty-four patients admitted to icu for at least 5 days; 59 were intubated. interventions: microbiologic cultures of serially taken samples of gastric aspirates, oropharyngeal swabs, and tracheal aspirates were performed at the time of icu admission and subsequently twice a week. diagnosis of pneumonia was based on quantitative cultures from bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) and protected specimen brush (psb). sequences of colonization were examined by comparing isolates of the same species, with concordance of minimum inhibitory concentration values to six antibiotics. measurements and results: eleven patients developed 14 episodes of nosocomial pneumonia, yielding 20 species of microorganisms. seventeen of 20 species (85 percent), associated with pneumonia, were cultured, previous to or on the day of  diagnosis, from tracheal aspirates, and 6 of 20 (30 percent) species were cultured from gastric samples. a sequence of colonization from the stomach to the upper respiratory tract eventually leading to pneumonia was not observed in any of the six species. initial colonization with pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter species was more often demonstrated in the trachea (16/24 and 13/25  cases) as compared with the stomach (1/24 and 6/25 cases; p < 0.0001 and p = 0.02 respectively). in contrast, initial colonization with klebsiella species and enterococcus faecalis was more frequently demonstrated in the stomach (13/28 and  8/15 cases) as compared with the trachea (6/28 and 0/15 cases; p = 0.02 and p < 0.0001, respectively). conclusions: based on studying sequences of colonization in icu patients, we concluded that the stomach is unlikely to be an important source of pathogens leading to nosocomial pneumonia as diagnosed by bal/psb. furthermore, the initial site and route of colonization might not be the same for all microorganisms.

TI  == cefepime: a new fourth-generation cephalosporin.
AB  == the chemistry, pharmacology, antimicrobial spectrum, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and dosage of cefepime are reviewed. fourth-generation cephalosporins, such as cefepime, have a quaternary nitrogen that is positively charged at the 3-position, providing the properties of a zwitterion. a 2-aminothiazolyl-acetamido group in the side chain at the 7-position with an alpha-oxyimino substitution may enhance stability against beta-lactamases by preventing the enzymes' approach to the main nucleus. cefepime may exert its antimicrobial effect by attaching to specific penicillin-binding proteins, disrupting cell-wall synthesis. cefepime has good activity against gram-positive  organisms, such as staphylococcus aureus, and gram-negative organisms, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa. cefepime is not active in vitro against enterococcus faecalis, clostridium difficile, and methicillin- and cefazolin-resistant staph.  aureus. cefepime's activity against gram-negative organisms is similar to that of most third-generation cephalosporins. the agent has poor activity against bacteroides species. the most common mechanism of resistance to cefepime is the excess production of beta-lactamases. maximum peak plasma concentrations are two  to three times higher after i.v. administration than after intramuscular administration. in healthy adults, the volume of distribution is 13-22 l and the  elimination half-life is 2-2.3 hours. clinical studies show that cefepime is as effective as cefotaxime or ceftazidime in patients with infections of the lower respiratory tract, skin and skin structures, urinary tract, or female reproductive system. cefepime reduces fever as effectively as ceftazidime or piperacillin plus gentamicin in neutropenic patients. the most common adverse effects of cefepime are headache (2.4%), nausea (1.8%), rash (1.8%), and diarrhea (1.7%). depending on creatinine clearance, the dosage of cefepime is 1000-2000 mg i.v. every 8-24 hours for life-threatening infections and 500-2000 mg i.v. every  12-24 hours for severe infections. cefepime's clinical efficacy is comparable to  that of ceftazidime and cefotaxime.

AB  == using multiple drug-resistant clinical isolates isolated since september 1992, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefpirome (cpr) were determined. several control drugs were also used, and these mic-determinations were made to determine the antibiotic activity of cpr. the obtained results are summarized as  follows: 1. antibiotic activities of cpr against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp., enterococcus faecalis, and benzylpenicillin-insensitive or resistant streptococcus pneumoniae showed that expanded antibacterial spectrum of cpr and its enhanced antibiotic action against gram-positive bacteria. we suggest that among the existing fourth-generation cephem antibiotics, cpr is "characteristically strong against gram-positive bacteria". 2. strong antibiotic  activities of cpr were recognized against bacteria of family enterobacteriaceae that were resistant to the third-generation cephems. the strong antibiotic activities appeared to be due to cpr's stability and decreased affinity for beta-lactamase. 3. antibacterial spectrum of cpr was expanded against non-glucose fermented gram-negative bacilli including pseudomonas aeruginosa. it appears that this expansion of antibacterial spectrum is due to cpr's affinities for a wide range of penicillin-binding proteins as well as its improved permeability into tissues.

TI  == survey of bacteraemia in a spanish hospital over a decade (1981-1990).
AB  == the aetiology, epidemiology and in-vitro antibiotic susceptibility of bacteraemic isolates in a spanish hospital, over a decade (1981-1990), were reviewed. a total of 4363 possible episodes were microbiologically confirmed (incidence: 15.7 cases per 1000 admissions). a slight increase in the number of gram-positive cocci and  anaerobes over the last 4 years was found. the most frequent species (annual range) were: escherichia coli (13.5%-18.9%), staphylococcus aureus (10.5%-17.8%), klebsiella spp. (3.0%-9.4%), enterococcus faecalis (3.0%-8.2%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%-5.8%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (1.8%-5.6%). males were more  affected than females (ratio 1.7:1). the portal of entry was known in 2126 episodes, of which the most frequent were urinary and gasto-intestinal tracts (24.4% and 19.4% respectively). bacteraemia was associated with rapidly and ultimately fatal underlying diseases in 7.2% and 15.1% of the cases respectively. the hospital location of patients was: medical ward 46.0%, surgical ward 22.7%, paediatric ward 16.9%, and intensive care unit 14.4%.

TI  == postantibiotic effect of du-6859a and levofloxacin as compared with ofloxacin.
AB  == the postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for two of the newer fluoroquinolones: du-6859a and levofloxacin. all drugs (including ofloxacin control) had good pae activity against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. only du-6859a had pae test conditions (< or = 0.5 mu/ml) that coincided with achievable clinical concentrations for all organisms tested. these data indicate that levofloxacin, like ofloxacin (paes, 1.0-2.9 h), could be administered once or twice daily and that the dosing of du-6859a (paes, 1.6-2.4 h) might be extended to once every 24 h because of its documented pae and its potency advantages as compared with levofloxacin and ofloxacin.

TI  == detection of bacteria in phagocyte-smears from septicemia-suspected blood by in situ hybridization using biotinylated probes.
AB  == we report herein the detection of intracellular bacteria in phagocyte-smears obtained from septicemia-suspected blood samples by in situ hybridization. this was obtained by using nick-translated biotin-11-dutp-labeled dna probes and streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugates for visualization of the hybridized  signals. the probes were made from random genomic dna clones of bacteria which are frequently the causative agents of bacteremia, such as staphylococcus spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp.  and enterobacter spp. when our in situ hybridization method was compared with conventional culture protocols for the ability to detect bacteria from the blood  of patients suspected of having septicemia, 30 positive results were obtained in  50 specimens by in situ hybridization methods. in contrast, only 7 positive results were obtained by blood cultures. thus, even if bacteria cannot be detected by conventional blood cultures and histology, our in situ hybridization  method allows for direct observation of bacterial foci in circulating phagocytes  and identification of the bacteria. our investigations suggest that in septicemia, circulating polymorphonuclear neutrophils carry some surviving bacteria as well as metabolized bacterial dna and rna for a considerable period of time. thus, our in situ hybridization method using the phagocyte-smears have diagnostic value for detecting most bacteria which cause septicemia.

AB  == since 1984, when the first fluoroquinolone, norfloxacin, was marketed in europe,  there has been a marked increase in the usage of this class of drugs. in order to evaluate the influence of this drug usage on the prevalence of resistance to fluoroquinolones in clinical isolates of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococcus faecalis we reviewed the susceptibility data from four collaborative surveys conducted between 1983 and 1990 by the study group 'bacterial resistance' of the paul-ehrlich-society for chemotherapy. all participating laboratories used the same standardized methods. minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by the broth microdilution method. more than 20,000 bacterial strains were tested. the results are presented for ciprofloxacin, which is regarded as the representative of the fluoroquinolones. using > or = 4 mg/l as a breakpoint for resistance to ciprofloxacin, the prevalence of resistant strains of the family enterobacteriaceae in central europe between 1983 and 1990 remained below 1%. in contrast, the resistance rates in p. aeruginosa were 0.7%, 1.0%, 3.8% and 7.0%, in s. aureus 0%, 0.5%, 6.6% and  6.8%, and in e. faecalis 2.2%, 0.7%, 4.9% and 7.7% in 1983, 1986, 1989 and 1990,  respectively. the latest study carried out in cooperation with 78 laboratories from 12 european countries revealed great differences in the prevalence of resistance to fluoroquinolones from one species to another ranging from 0% with proteus vulgaris and salmonella spp. to 26.7% with providencia stuartii.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [staghorn renal lithiasis treated with shock waves. bacteriologic aspects].
AB  == struvite renal stones are caused by infection of the urine with bacteria that synthesize the enzyme urease. ammonium is released by the breakdown of urea by urease, the urine becomes highly alkaline, and magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) and carbonate apatite crystallize. incorporation of the infecting bacteria within the developing stone, results in a focus of infection that is resistant to conventional antimicrobial therapy, and which is manifested clinically by repeated urinary tract infection caused by persistent bacteriuria.  extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (eswl) currently is accepted as the election treatment for most renal calculi. this trial examines the bacteriologic  aspects pre and post-eswl. eighty adult patients, 47 females and 33 males, without clinical signs of urinary tract infections (uti) were submitted to urine  cultures pre and post-eswl. the first 50 patients underwent during and post-eswl, 150 blood cultures, which all proved to be negative, confirming very low risk of  generalized sepsis. no patient presented fever, chills or rigors pre or postprocedures. with respect to urine cultures 43 patients (52.5%) had a pre-eswl uti, in comparison to 49 (60%) who had a uti post-eswl. the distribution of organisms pre and post-eswl was as follows: proteus mirabilis (22/22), escherichia coli (11/11), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4/5), klebsiella pneumoniae (2/2), enterobacter cloacae (0/1), alcaligenes odorans (1/2) enterococcus faecalis (1/3), staphylococcus saprophyticus (1/2) and candida albicans (1/1). in this study 6 patients presented bacteriuria post-eswl probably due to bacteria from inside the calculi. according to these results, the risk of bacteremia seems to be very low. in 60% of staghorn renal stones we could demonstrate a bacterial  infection.

AB  == cap37 (cationic antimicrobial protein of molecular mass 37 kda) is a multifunctional protein isolated from the granules of human neutrophils. it is antibiotic and chemotactic and binds lipopolysaccharide. a synthetic peptide, amino acid sequence nqgrhfcggaliharfvmtaascfq, based on residues 20-44 of cap37 protein mimics its antibiotic and lipopolysaccharide binding action. peptide 20-44, at the concentrations tested, has antibacterial activity against salmonella typhimurium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus. the bactericidal action of the peptide was ph dependent, with maximum activity at ph 5.0 and ph 5.5 and decreased activity at ph 7.0. various truncations, substitutions, and other modifications in the sequence deteriorate its activity. free sulfhydryl groups and/or disulfide bridge formation are required for optimum antibiotic activity, since substitution of serines for, or alkylation of, cysteine residues 26 and 42 eliminates bactericidal activity. evidently amino acids 20-44 represent an important, perhaps principal, antibacterial domain of cap37. this peptide should provide new insight into the mechanism of antimicrobial activity of cap37 and may serve as a  model for new, useful, synthetic antibiotics.

AB  == during the pathogenesis of catheter-related urinary tract infection, bacteria attach to the catheter and migrate along a biofilm into the bladder. we studied the effect of coating silastic catheters with salicylic acid on bacterial and yeast adherence. an agar roll technique, bioluminescent assay, and radiolabeling  study all produced consistent results. there was a dose related inhibition of adherence with pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, candida albicans, and enterococcus faecalis. inhibition of over 90% was noted with enterobacter and pseudomonas. similar results were obtained in broth and synthetic urine. a dose related reduction in adherence was seen with all gram-negative rods and yeast as measured by a radiolabeling assay. tdmac was  used to bind the salicylic acid to the catheters with > 95% inhibition of the gram-negative rods. these studies suggest the potential role of coating catheters with salicylic acid to reduce bacterial adherence and urinary tract infection.

TI  == quantitative and qualitative analysis of bacteria in er(iii) solution by thin-film magnetopheresis.
AB  == magnetic deposition, quantitation, and identification of bacteria reacting with the paramagnetic trivalent lanthanide ion, er, was evaluated. the magnetic deposition method was dubbed thin-film magnetopheresis. the optimization of the magnetic deposition protocol was accomplished with escherichia coli as a model organism in 150 mm nacl and 5 mm ercl(3) solution. three gram-positive bacteria,  staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, and enterococcus faecalis, and four gram-negative bacteria, e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and klebsiella pneumoniae, were subsequently investigated. quantitative analysis consisted of the microscopic cell count and a scattered-light scanning of the magnetically deposited material aided by the computer data acquisition system. qualitative analysis consisted of gram stain differentiation and fluorescein isothiocyanate staining in combination with selected antisera against specific types of bacteria on the solid substrate. the  magnetic deposition protocol allowed quantitative detection of e. coli down to the concentration of 10 cfu ml, significant in clinical diagnosis applications such as urinary tract infections. er did not interfere with the typical appearance of the gram-stained bacteria nor with the antigen recognition by the antibody in the immunohistological evaluations. indirect antiserum-fluorescein isothiocyanate labelling correctly revealed the presence of e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa in the magnetically deposited material obtained from the mixture of these two bacterial species. on average, the reaction of gram-positive organisms  was significantly stronger to the magnetic field in the presence of er than the reaction of gram-negative organisms. the thin-film magnetophoresis offers promise as a rapid method for quantitative and qualitative analysis of bacteria in solutions such as urine or environmental water.

AB  == the authors studied 5 disinfectants containing aldehyde and quaternary ammonium against 108 hospital strains. the minimal bactericidal activities (mbc) were determined with a microdilution method and the dilution-neutralization method (afnor t 72-150). the microdilution method results were validated using the mbcs  of four reference strains tested with the dilution-neutralization method (afnor t 72-150). 3 disinfectants proved to be valuable. 1 disinfectant was valuable but with a mbc toward all bacteria only a dilution away from the dilution of use. 1 disinfectant was determined as unsatisfactory as 9.5 p. cent of all strains proved resistant toward it. all disinfectants matched afnor standards; but those  specifications did not match toward hospital strains. such an evaluation using a  simple and reliable method should be of use.

TI  == factors affecting the selection and use of tetrazolium salts as cytochemical indicators of microbial viability and activity.
AB  == the reduction of four tetrazolium cations (tcs), nitroblue tetrazolium (nbt), neotetrazolium (nt), methylthiazolyldiphenyltetrazolium (mtt) and iodonitrophenyltetrazolium (int), by viable micro-organisms, immobilized on glass cover slips, was examined by light microscopy with a view to determining a systematic basis for applying these reagents as cytochemical indicators of microbial viability and activity. the potential value of histochemical information about tc reactions for developing their microbiological applications  was also assessed. int and mtt detected viable cells more readily than nbt and nt. in order to obtain cell-localized formazan, mtt required cobalt ions in the reaction mixture and int reactions had to be assessed soon after mounting. in general, formazan deposition could be accelerated by the addition of glucose and  an intermediate electron carrier (iec) to the reaction mixture, although inhibitory effects of iecs were also detected. cultures in exponential phase, in  stationary phase and inhibited by chloramphenicol could be differentiated with mtt but not with int. for some organisms, notably candida albicans, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis. tc reactions proved to be a relatively insensitive means of demonstrating viability. two parameters used in selecting tcs for histochemical reactions, lipophilicity and reducibility appeared to be predictive for the relative sensitivity of these reagents as indicators of cell viability. the concepts of substantivity, a measure of non-specific interactions  between reagents and staining substrates, and tc oxygen sensitivity, the effect of competition between oxygen and tcs for electrons, were found to be relevant to formazan deposition in live microbes. these findings support the use of tcs as cytochemical probes of microbial activity in defined settings and the use of histochemical knowledge to support further development of these techniques.

AB  == a physiologically diverse range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin b, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. the list of susceptible organisms includes escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, corynebacterium diphtheriae, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens.  concentrations of lactoferricin b required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and  the culture medium used. the peptide showed activity against e. coli o111 over the range of ph 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of na+, k+, mg2+ or ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. lactoferricin  b was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. pseudomonas fluorescens, enterococcus faecalis and bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.

TI  == optimal method for culturing vascular prosthetic grafts.
AB  == vascular prosthetic infection may be underrecognized when identified by standard  culture techniques. improved microbiologic methodology may enhance detection of bacteria in prosthetic graft specimens, and thus may alter clinical decisions. quantitative culture techniques were employed to compare three methods of enhancing bacterial recovery from dacron graft cylinders seeded with commonly encountered bacterial pathogens. methods included: (1) ultrasonic bath treatment, (2) direct ultrasonic disruption, and (3) agitation on a vortex mixer. ultrasonic bath treatment released bacteria with colony counts that were consistently greater by 1 log than direct ultrasonic disruption and vortex agitation. direct ultrasonic disruption at high energy levels selectively killed gram-negative bacteria by as much as a 4 log decrease in viable organisms. agitation (vortex mixing) of the specimen produced the lowest counts among the three methods tested. these data would indicate that a 5-min ultrasonic bath treatment was the  optimal method of preparation of vascular prostheses for bacterial culture.

AB  == an electrical device designed to prevent microbial attachment to plastic intravascular cannulae is described. the device produced an electrical current (10 microa) in both carbon-impregnated and 'hydrocath' cannulae. in-vitro models  were utilized to demonstrate that the current can block several mechanisms by which microorganisms gain initial access to intravascular devices, including extra- and intra-luminal routes. the electrical system prevented organisms from traversing along both the external and internal surfaces of the cannulae. effective prevention of cannula colonization was demonstrated subsequent to challenge with staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. the findings suggest that the electrical device may offer in-vivo cannula protection  from microbial attachment and colonization, thereby reducing the potential for infection.

TI  == determination of the chromosomal size of three different strains of enterococcus  faecalis and one strain of enterococcus faecium.
AB  == pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to determine the chromosomal size of three different strains of enterococcus faecalis and one strain of enterococcus faecium. the size determinations of og1x, a strain of e. faecalis widely used in  many laboratories for genetic studies, using sma i, not i, and sfi i alone or in  combination, ranged from 2,750 to 2,761 kb. using the same enzymes as with og1x,  the size of hh-67, a plasmid-free clinical isolate of e. faecalis, was determined to be 2,170-2,288 kb and the size of jh2-2, an e. faecalis recipient strain, ranged from 2,008 to 2,135 kb. the size range generated for ge-1, a plasmid-free  e. faecium strain, with the use of sma i, not i, and apa i was 2,045-2,155 kb. although og1x differed in size from the other three enterococci, each individual  enterococcal strain generated reproducible results in different experiments. however, for both e. faecalis og1x and e. faecium ge-1, one of the enzymes used generated a considerably smaller molecular size than that generated by the other  two enzymes. the discrepancy was due to visually undiscernible comigrating fragments, and serves to point out a potential source of error if fewer than two  enzymes are used to size a genome. the size discrepancies were resolved by digesting individual fragments with a second enzyme. the molecular sizes of these enterococcal strains are larger than that recently reported for campylobacter, smaller than that of escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and similar (og1x) or smaller (jh2-2, hh67, and ge-1) than the 2,819-kb reported for streptococcus mutans.

TI  == microflora of the pouch of the koala (phascolarctos cinereus).
AB  == microflora of the pouch epithelium of 17 female koalas (phascolarctos cinereus) were examined in relation to their current reproductive status and recent reproductive history. no microbial growth was observed in pouch swabs from 13 of  17 (76%) koalas, including four females without young, seven with pouch young and two with back young (i.e. permanently emerged from the pouch). growth of bacteria or yeasts was observed in pouch swabs from four koalas, each of which had experienced mortality of its pouch young during the current breeding season. seven species of microorganisms were isolated, including pseudomonas aeruginosa,  serratia marcescens and enterococcus faecalis. based on the absence of microflora in the majority of females examined, we propose that the pouch epithelium normally provides a hostile environment for microbial colonization.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of e1077, a new cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum.
AB  == e1077 is a novel parenteral cephalosporin with a wide spectrum of potent antibacterial activity against aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, e1077 was twice as active as cefpirome, with an mic for 90% of strains tested (mic90) of 0.78 micrograms/ml. methicillin-resistant s. aureus was moderately to  highly resistant to e1077, but e1077 was at least twice as active as other beta-lactams tested. against enterococcus faecalis, e1077 was the most active of  the cephalosporins tested (mic90, 12.5 micrograms/ml) and was at least fourfold more active than cefpirome and ceftazidime. at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.78 micrograms/ml, e1077 inhibited 90% of streptococci and most of the  members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested, with the exceptions of serratia  marcescens and proteus vulgaris, for which the mic90s of e1077 were both 3.13 micrograms/ml. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, e1077 was two- to fourfold more active than cefpirome and ceftazidime. for the anaerobes, e1077 was as active against bacteroides fragilis as was cefuzonam, and its activity was fourfold higher than those of cefpirome and ceftazidime. e1077 was at least as resistant as cefpirome to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases, and these enzymes had a low affinity for e1077.

TI  == [antimicrobial and membranolytic activities of anti-burn drug fenozan].
AB  == fenozan, an anti-burn preparation, was shown to have antimicrobial activity against freshly isolated clinical strains of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis, as well as against collection strains of the other gram-positive bacteria. the antimicrobial action of the preparation was possibly  due to impairment of permeability of the cytoplasmic membranes in the sensitive bacterial cells and their liberation of intracellular low molecular weight compounds to the environment. the membranolytic and minimum inhibitory concentrations of fenozan with respect to the sensitive bacterial cells were one  order of magnitude lower than the concentration stabilizing the membranes of animal cells in the treatment of burns. combination of the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties in fenozan was likely to provide its satisfactory therapeutic effect in the treatment of burn wounds.

TI  == the housefly (musca domestica) as a carrier of pathogenic microorganisms in a hospital environment.
AB  == houseflies have long been regarded as potential carriers of microorganisms. since pathogenic microorganisms are widespread in the hospital environment, there is abundant opportunity for flies to become contaminated and, in turn, to contaminate the patient environment. in the present study, an attempt was made to isolate and identify pathogenic bacteria, fungi and parasites from the housefly musca domestica collected in the surgical ward of the all india institute of medical sciences hospital and also in a remote residential area located 5 km from the hospital. a total of 113 flies were collected: 65 from a surgical ward (test) and 48 from a residential area for comparison. ten genera of bacteria were isolated from the test group of flies compared with nine from the control group.  in primary isolations, it was observed that the load of bacteria carried by the test group of flies was significantly more (p less than 0.001) than for the control flies. pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and viridans streptococci were isolated only from the test flies. the isolation rate of staphylococcus aureus was significantly higher (p less than 0.001) in test houseflies than in the control houseflies. there was no significant difference in isolation of parasitic ova and cysts from test and control houseflies. candida spp. were isolated in almost equal numbers from both groups of houseflies, yet none of these was candida albicans. houseflies therefore may act as vectors of potentially pathogenic bacteria in a hospital environment.

TI  == in vitro activity of sparfloxacin compared with those of five other quinolones.
AB  == the in vitro activity of sparfloxacin, a new difluorinated quinolone, was evaluated against 857 gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates and compared with those of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, fleroxacin, and lomefloxacin. the mic of sparfloxacin for 90% of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested was 0.5 microgram/ml (range, 0.06 to 4.0 micrograms/ml); only for members of the genera serratia, citrobacter, and providencia were mics above 1 microgram/ml. some 90% of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were inhibited by 8 micrograms of the drug per ml. the mics for 90% of staphylococcus spp. and enterococcus faecalis were 0.12 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. all (100%) streptococcus pneumoniae strains were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml. the inoculum size had little effect on either the mic or the mbc of sparfloxacin. an increase in the magnesium concentration from 1.1 to 8.4 mm increased the mic between 2 and 10 times, depending on the genus tested. sparfloxacin was less active at ph 5. the antibacterial activity of sparfloxacin  against gram-positive bacteria was generally higher than those of the quinolones  with which it was compared; against streptococcus pneumoniae, sparfloxacin was four- and eightfold more active than ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. the activity of sparfloxacin against gram-negative rods was generally comparable  to that of ciprofloxacin except against enterobacter and acinetobacter spp., pseudomonas cepacia, xanthomonas maltophilia, and alcaligenes and flavobacterium  spp., against which sparfloxacin was the most active quinolone.

TI  == quantitative separation of bacteria in saline solution using lanthanide er(iii) and a magnetic field.
AB  == a trivalent lanthanide ion, erbium (er3+), has been used in combination with a magnetic separation technique to isolate seven bacterial species from suspensions in 0.9% saline. erbium has an exceptionally high atomic magnetic moment of 9.3 bohr magnetons, and following addition as ercl3 (final concentration 5 mm) to bacterial suspensions, it imparts the magnetic moment to the bacterial cells by ionic binding to the cell surface. strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus and enterococcus faecalis were obtained from the quality control depository of the cleveland clinic foundation, cleveland, ohio, usa as suspensions in 0.9% nacl, in concentrations ranging from  10(2) to 10(8) c.f.u. ml-1. bacteria were separated from solution inside a capillary flow cell exposed to a highly non-homogeneous magnetic field (maximum field intensity was 0.4 t) and quantified by a light scattering method. the quantity of cellular deposition in the magnetic field was correlated with the initial concentration of cells in the suspension, expressed in c.f.u. ml-1, and sample volume (1.5 and 3.0 ml), sample ph (prior to ercl3 addition), affinity to  gram stain (negative vs positive) and species.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == to better define the pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activity (sba) of ciprofloxacin and other antimicrobial agents in the elderly, six healthy (greater than 65 years) volunteers with normal renal function were given ciprofloxacin alone orally, ciprofloxacin plus rifampin orally, ciprofloxacin plus clindamycin  orally, rifampin alone orally (three volunteers), and, for comparison of sba against gram-positive cocci, vancomycin intravenously. mean peak ciprofloxacin concentrations and other pharmacokinetic parameters were not altered significantly by coadministration of either rifampin or clindamycin. ciprofloxacin had somewhat greater sba against the oxacillin-susceptible and oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains tested than did vancomycin, but rifampin was by far the most active single agent tested. the sba of rifampin against s. aureus was modestly antagonized during combination therapy with ciprofloxacin, but substantial sba still was present. the ciprofloxacin sba against s. aureus was completely antagonized by clindamycin if the strains were susceptible to the latter agent. ciprofloxacin had modest sba against group a streptococci and no sba against the three pneumococcal strains tested. all of the regimens had poor to absent sba against enterococcus faecalis. by contrast, ciprofloxacin had excellent sba against escherchia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae and moderate sba against pseudomonas aeruginosa. combination therapy with rifampin or clindamycin in general enhanced the sba against the nonenterococcal streptococci and had no effect on the sba against the gram-negative bacilli.

TI  == [antibacterial activities of ofloxacin against recent isolates from patients with community-acquired infections].
AB  == in order to survey antibacterial activities of ofloxacin (oflx) against 1,440 bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired infections in 1987 and 1990, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the drug as well as those of other new quinolones and oral cephems were determined. the following conclusions were reached. 1. comparison of the mic distribution for strains isolated in 1987 with those in 1990 suggested a tendency toward an increase in the frequency of oflx-resistant isolates with the passage of time of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella ssp., enterobacter spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. most common elevations of mic  values against these bacteria were observed in mic80 and mic90 values, while no significant alteration was observed in mic50 values. however, mic50's of oflx against serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa were relatively high for strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. most of the oflx-resistant strains of s.  aureus seemed to be methicillin-resistant (mrsa). furthermore, mic80 of oflx against coagulase-negative staphylococci was high in strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. 2. susceptibility of streptococcus spp. was evaluated only in strains isolated in 1990. the results were comparable to those reported by others in the early 1980s. 3. bacteria which showed no or infrequent emergence of oflx-resistant strains even in 1990 were proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, campylobacter spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. 4. recently isolated strains from patients with community-acquired infections showed a tendency toward an increase of the frequency of oflx-resistant strains among many bacteria. however, the bacteria which contained high percentages of oflx-resistant strains except for mrsa were so-called less-virulent bacteria, and in the other bacteria elevations of mic values were only observed in mic80 and mic90. these results suggested that oflx preserved a potent antibacterial activity against bacteria which were major causative pathogens in community-acquired infections.

TI  == activity of antiseptics against biofilms of mixed bacterial species growing on silicone surfaces.
AB  == as part of a programme to establish the relative merits of antiseptics that are used as bladder instillations to control urinary tract infections in patients with indwelling catheters, the activity of five such formulations were tested against dense (10(9) cfu/cm2) mixed biofilms composed of citrobacter diversus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis growing on silicone discs. all three species were resistant to chlorhexidine (200 mg/l) and povidone-iodine (1%  v/v) in the biofilm mode of growth, whereas these agents rapidly eliminated viable cells from urine suspensions of the mixed community. lactic acid (1% v/v)  produced a 1 log reduction of the biofilm population within 30 min of exposure. the mandelic acid (1% w/v) and mandelic acid (0.5% w/v)/lactic acid (0.5% v/v) mixture proved to be the most effective in eliminating the biofilm organisms. it  is suggested that these latter solutions should now be tested for efficacy in bladder washouts against urinary tract infections in catheterized patients.

TI  == effect of oral spiramycin on the faecal and oral bacteria in human volunteers.
AB  == six healthy adult volunteers were treated with 1 g of oral spiramycin twice daily for five days, and their oral and faecal microbial flora were studied. mean saliva and serum concentrations of the antibiotic never exceeded 2.1 +/- 1.1 mg/l. the number of volunteers whose oral cavity was colonized by enterobacteriaceae, group d streptococci, staphylococci, and fungi remained unchanged following treatment. the mean count of anaerobic faecal bacteria was 10.3 +/- 0.6 log10 cfu/g initially. this did not change significantly during the  treatment, nor did the composition of the predominant anaerobic flora. mean counts of group d streptococci were 1000 times lower than those of anaerobes before treatment, and also remained unchanged during therapy. no overgrowth of fungi, staphylococci, or pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed. no significant modifications occurred in the mean total count of faecal enterobacteriaceae (7.9  +/- 0.4 versus 7.4 +/- 1.0 log10 cfu/g of faeces before and during treatment respectively). however, faecal concentrations of highly spiramycin-resistant enterobacteriaceae (mic greater than or equal to 512 mg/l) increased from 4.8 +/- 1.2 to 7.0 +/- 1.8 log10 cfu/g during treatment. the mic50 value of spiramycin for anaerobes, enterobacteriaceae, and group d streptococci were 0.125, 64, and 0.5 mg/l respectively before treatment, and these increased to 1024, 512 and 1024 mg/l respectively during treatment. this was attributed to the rise in the faecal concentrations of spiramycin, which reached 689 +/- 48 micrograms/g of faeces on  the fifth day of treatment. these concentrations decreased rapidly on cessation of treatment.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against fresh clinical isolates from superficial suppurative foci].
AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (cpfx), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of cpfx against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. the clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. interpreting mic level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. when activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, cpfx expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (oflx) and norfloxacin (nflx) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of cpfx against bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of oflx, and cpfx had similar activity against staphylococcus aureus to oflx. 2. in comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, cpfx was inferior to amoxicillin (ampc) against e. faecalis and inferior to ampc and cefaclor (ccl) against peptostreptococcus spp.  against all other bacterial species, however, cpfx expressed superior antibacterial potency to ampc and ccl. 3. scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to cpfx were observed among the s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. faecium, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, p. aeruginosa and b. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of e. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.

TI  == effect of hydrogen peroxide on growth of candida, cryptococcus, and other yeasts  in simulated blood culture bottles.
AB  == the addition of hydrogen peroxide to blood contained in liquid culture medium increased the dissolved-o2 partial pressure in direct proportion to the volume injected. the effect of hydrogen peroxide on the growth of subcultured clinical isolates of candida albicans, cryptococcus neoformans, torulopsis glabrata, and other yeasts and on the growth of blood culture isolates of representative pathogenic bacteria was compared with its effect on their growth in vented and unvented stationary bottles. c. albicans and c. neoformans grew significantly better in bottles to which hydrogen peroxide had been added than in vented or unvented bottles. the advantage of hydrogen peroxide over venting was most marked with several slowly growing strains. similar results were obtained in shaker cultures with strains of c. albicans which were inoculated directly from positive blood cultures. the effect of hydrogen peroxide tended to diminish during serial  passage. t. glabrata grew less well when hydrogen peroxide was added, perhaps because of the absence of oxidase. the growth of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococcus faecalis was not significantly inhibited or augmented by the addition of hydrogen peroxide. the growth of escherichia coli was inhibited slightly. the value of the addition of hydrogen peroxide to blood cultures to improve the isolation of yeasts needs to be established by a clinical trial which would compare this method with established methods.

TI  == comparative antimicrobial activity of ceftibuten against multiply-resistant microorganisms from belgium.
AB  == to study the activity of ceftibuten, we obtained multiply-resistant isolates from approximately 20 hospitals in belgium. against enterobacteriaceae, all of the tested comparative compounds were more active than cefaclor, and ceftibuten and tigemonam were the most active of the agents tested. ceftibuten mic50s were less  than or equal to 1 microgram/ml for most enteric bacilli species and 85% of strains were susceptible (less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml). this level of activity compared favorably to that recorded for cefaclor (less than or equal to  8 micrograms/ml), cefetamet (less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml), and cefteram (less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml), that is, 37%, 69%, and 59%, respectively. ceftibuten, cefetamet, cefteram, and tigemonam were highly active against isolates of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae. none of the comparative agents were as active as cefaclor against staphylococcal isolates. against streptococci, cefteram was the most active, and tigemonam the least active of the agents. the mic90s of ceftibuten for strains of streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes were 2 micrograms/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml,  respectively. strains of streptococcus agalactiae were resistant to both ceftibuten and tigemonam; cefaclor and cefteram inhibited 100% of isolates of this species. strains of enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa were consistently resistant to all of the compounds. overall, ceftibuten exhibited potent activity against many multiply-resistant clinical isolates.

TI  == [experimental criteria for interpretation of bacterial sensitivity to dioxidine determined by diffusion from the disks].
AB  == antibacterial activity of dioxidine against aerobic and facultative anaerobic organisms under conditions of anaerobiosis i. e. conditions really observed for example in abscess cavities or necrotic tissues is 30 to 100 times as high as that under aerobic conditions. there is a relationship between sensitivity of bacteria to dioxidine under aerobic and anaerobic conditions which is expressed by the regression equation. therefore, comparison of the mics determined under anaerobic conditions with the growth inhibition zones formed by disks with the drug under aerobic conditions is possible. the mic of dioxidine was determined under anaerobic conditions for 179 clinical strains of aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria and the growth inhibition zones of the same bacteria under aerobic conditions were evaluated with the use of disks containing 100, 75, 50, 25, 20, and 15 micrograms of the drug. the border line. mic differentiating between resistant and sensitive strains was chosen to be equal to 4 micrograms/ml. differentiation of the strains into sensitive and resistant ones by the values of the growth inhibition zones was performed with the method of error minimization described by c. metzler and r. de haan in 1974. disks containing 25 micrograms of the drug allowed one to differentiate the strains under aerobic conditions into sensitive and resistant ones: the growth inhibition zones greater than 11 mm corresponded to the sensitive strains (the mic smaller than 4 micrograms/ml) and the growth inhibition zones smaller than 11 mm corresponded to the resistant strains (the mic greater than 4 micrograms/ml).

TI  == in vitro evaluation of win 57273, a new broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone.
AB  == win 57273 is a new fluoroquinolone that has an expanded spectrum of activity against staphylococcus spp. (mic for 90% of isolates [mic90], 0.008 microgram/ml), enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 0.06 microgram/ml), bacillus spp. (mic90, 0.03 micrograms/ml), listeria monocytogenes (mic90, 0.06 microgram/ml), streptococcus spp. (mic90, 0.03 microgram/ml), and bacteroides fragilis group strains (mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml). like other fluoroquinolone compounds, win 57273 was active against members of the family enterobacteriaceae (97% of strains inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml), haemophilus, branhamella, and neisseria strains (100% susceptible), acinetobacter spp. (100% susceptible),  and pseudomonas aeruginosa (68% susceptible). we observed that win 57273 was very active against cephalosporin- or aminoglycoside-resistant gram-negative strains but shared cross-resistance with other fluoroquinolones. increasing inoculum concentrations had minimal effects on win 57273 mics, and the drug was considered to be bactericidal based on reference mbc and kill curve analyses. unlike most previously studied drugs in this class, win 57273 had increased activity (three-  to fourfold) at low ph. rates of mutation to win 57273 resistance at eight times  its mic were in the range of 5.6 x 10(-8) to greater than 1.4 x 10(-9). this new  compound possesses a wide potential spectrum of use, and it should be evaluated further by in vitro and in vivo studies.

TI  == new screening test to determine the acceptability of 0.45-micron membrane filters for analysis of water.
AB  == during routine membrane filter (mf) quality control testing, irregularities such  as partial or complete inhibition of microbial growth at grid lines, abnormal spreading of colonies, growth in or along the grid lines, nonwetting areas, poor  colony sheen and metallic sheen on the mf surface with mendo agar, brittleness, decreased recovery, and severe wrinkling were observed with several lots of filters. to study these effects and to develop a more sensitive screening test for mf quality, we compared five different mfs with various types and degrees of  defects by using five stock coliform cultures and five different media. results showed that the enterobacter aerogenes-tryptic soy agar test system detected more mf defects than any other combination did and was superior to the escherichia coli-mfc agar american society for testing and materials method for grid line inhibition. filtered natural samples grown on the same media showed the same effects as were observed with the pure cultures. poor colony sheen and sheen on the mf surface were best detected with enterobacter aerogenes on mendo agar. the  use of tryptic soy agar and mendo agar with this organism permitted the maximum detection of mf irregularities. of the 142 mf lots tested by this method, 30% were acceptable, 10% were marginally acceptable, and 61% were unacceptable. this  method provides a valuable screening test for determining the acceptability of 0.45-microm-pore-size mfs used for coliform and heterotroph analysis and may also be useful in conjunction with other methods.

AB  == the efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of 68 episodes of bacteremia were studied. patients were treated intravenously (30 cases), orally (13 cases), or with sequential intravenous/oral therapy (25 cases). intravenous doses ranged from 200 to 400 mg per day and oral doses ranged from 1,000 to 1,500 mg per day. according to the criteria of mccabe and jackson, 39 cases had nonfatal and 29 had ultimately fatal underlying diseases. the clinical condition  of patients at the start of therapy was critical or poor in 40 cases and fair or  good in 28. sixty-four of the 68 episodes of bacteremia were monomicrobial and the remaining four were polymicrobial. the causative micro-organisms were: escherichia coli (18 episodes), pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 episodes), acinetobacter sp. (10 episodes), salmonella sp. (seven episodes), enterobacter sp. (six episodes), proteus sp. (four episodes), serratia sp. (four episodes), haemophilus influenzae (three episodes), klebsiella sp. (three episodes), staphylococcus aureus (2 episodes), and morganella morganii (two episodes). overall clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin was 94 percent (64 of 68 patients). bacteremia persisted in four patients (failure rate of 6 percent). five organisms persisted: acinetobacter sp. (two patients), p. aeruginosa (one patient), enterobacter sp. (one patient), and serratia sp. (one patient). side effects were phlebitis associated with intravenous administration (four cases), dizziness (four cases), and superinfection (six cases). superinfecting organisms and sites  were as follows: enterococcus faecalis, wound (2 cases); candida sp., urinary tract infection (one case); acinetobacter anitratus (ciprofloxacin resistant), urinary tract infection (one case); staphylococcus epidermidis, blood (one case); and clostridium perfringens, blood (one case). ciprofloxacin administered either  intravenously, orally, or intravenously followed by the oral route is effective therapy in the treatment of severe bacteremic infections.

TI  == intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin versus ceftazidime in the treatment of serious infections.
AB  == seventy-one adult patients with 72 infections were treated, by random selection,  with intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin or intravenously administered ceftazidime. twenty-seven additional patients with 29 infections who were not appropriate for  random assignment were treated in an open study with intravenously administered ciprofloxacin only; the latter infections were generally more serious or were caused by ceftazidime-resistant organisms. the most common doses were ciprofloxacin, 200 mg intravenously and 500 mg orally every 12 hours and ceftazidime, 1 to 2 g intravenously every eight to 12 hours. forty-seven ciprofloxacin-treated infections and 31 ceftazidime-treated infections were evaluable for determination of efficacy. infections included lower respiratory tract (21 infections), urinary (37 infections), skin/soft tissue (14 infections), bacteremia/endocarditis (four infections), colitis (one infection), and mastoiditis (one infection). median minimal inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were, respectively: for enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, and branhamella catarrhalis, no more than 0.06 and no more than 0.25 micrograms/ml; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 0.25 and 4 micrograms/ml; for enterococcus faecalis, 1 and more than 32 micrograms/ml; and for staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 and 8 micrograms/ml. ciprofloxacin, 200 mg intravenously, yielded mean serum concentrations 0.5 and eight hours post-intravenous infusion of 2.3 and 0.7 micrograms/ml, respectively. satisfactory clinical responses were achieved in 17 (81 percent) of 21 patients with intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin, 22 (71 percent) of 31 patients with ceftazidime, and 20 (77 percent) of 26 patients with intravenous ciprofloxacin. the most common treatment failures occurred in complicated skin/soft-tissue infections treated with intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin, complicated urinary tract infections treated with ceftazidime, and necrotizing p. aeruginosa pneumonia treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin; the pneumonia patients all had respiratory failure and had been previously unresponsive to treatment with other  appropriate drugs. serious adverse reactions were observed in three patients, seizures with intravenous ciprofloxacin in two patients, and clostridium difficile diarrhea with ceftazidime in one patient. we conclude that sequential intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were comparable in efficacy and safety; the ability to change from intravenous to oral therapy is a major convenience. intravenous ciprofloxacin was useful for more serious infections, often caused by ceftazidime-resistant organisms.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach to estimating the effective administration dose of  imipenem/cilastatin. evaluation of the disk susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  == in vitro activities of imipenem/cilastatin (ipm/cs) against 413 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of mics and the results of disk susceptibility tests. the mics were determined using the agar dilution method at  an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. the mic80s of imipenem (ipm) against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were 25 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively, showing a bimodal mic distribution. however, the distribution of mics against other bacteria studied was of monomodal pattern. group a streptococcus, enterococcus faecalis were inhibited by ipm at dose levels less than 0.025 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. ipm inhibited escherichia coli at 0.20 microgram/ml, klebsiella pneumoniae at 0.39 microgram/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one strain showed a mic of 25 micrograms/ml, serratia spp. at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one with mic greater than 100 micrograms/ml, citrobacter freundii at 0.78 microgram/ml and enterobacter spp. at 0.39 microgram/ml. indole (-) proteus and indole (+) proteus were inhibited by this drug at levels of 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. the reliability of the ipm disk diffusion susceptibility test in quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter showa disks containing 30 micrograms antibiotic and  also disks containing 1-30 micrograms prepared in this laboratory. for the interpretation of the showa disk susceptibility test, a 4 category system was used. in the 4 category system for showa ipm disk the following classification of inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed; ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. the results of the test using showa 30 micrograms disk against various clinical isolates were accurately classified into the 4 groups, showing false positive 8 out of 304 strains (2.6%) and false negative 1 of 304 strains (0.3%). with showa 30 micrograms disks subclassification of strains with mic less than 3 micrograms/ml  cannot be achieved. in this study, however, the differentiation of strains with mics less than 1 microgram/ml was made with disks containing 5-10 micrograms, which afforded to set mic break points at 1 and 3 micrograms/ml. according to current concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including the penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except in the hepato-biliary system.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1986). ii. background of patients].
AB  == from july to october in 1986, hospital data on 717 isolates of causative microorganism from patients with urinary tract infections and background information on 562 patients were collected. the urinary tract infections were divided into 3 groups; simple infections and complicated infections with or without the use of indwelling catheter. we investigated such factors as the patients' sex, age, and drug treatments, and the isolates obtained from the infections. from 1981 to 1986, about 25% of the patients with simple infections were males and about 60 to 70% among those with complicated infections were males each year. during these 6 years, no noticeable changes occurred in sex and age distributions of patients with any type of the infections, but the species of isolates changed remarkably. in 1982 and 1983, the isolation rates of enterococcus faecalis (streptococcus spp. or streptococcus faecalis) obtained from the patients were about 8% in both of male and female patients. in 1984, the rate in females increased to 17.9%. in 1985, the rates in males and females were  14.9% and 7.6%, respectively. similar rates were also observed in 1986: 16.1 and  7.4%. the isolation rate of staphylococcus aureus in 1982 was 0.7%, as was in 1983. in however, increased to 1.7% in 1984 and to 3.2% in 1985. it was 2.5% in 1986. the isolation rate of gram-positive bacteria was 11.1% in 1982; it increased to 18.9% in 1983 and to over 20% between 1984 to 1986. among gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of pseudomonas aeruginosa form patients with complicated urinary tract infections with a catheter was high and over 20% in both 1985 and 1986. when antibacterial agents were administrated for  3 days, changes in number of species of isolates tended to be more pronounced in  complicated infections with or without the use of catheter than in simple infections. according to date obtained in 1986, when antibiotic agents were administered for 8 or more days, the changes were definitely more drastic in complicated infections than in simple ones. an upmost care in the selection of antibiotic drugs according to their antibacterial spectra and activities, therefore, appears necessary, and an attention should be paid on future changes in species of bacteria isolated from infections.

TI  == postantibiotic effects of imipenem, norfloxacin, and amikacin in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == the postantibiotic effects (paes) of imipenem and norfloxacin were tested against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. amikacin was tested against the same bacteria except  streptococcus faecalis. for in vitro tests, a viable count-washing method was used, and for in vivo tests, the thread technique in normal mice was used. all three drugs produced paes of 1.1 to 3.8 h in vitro and 1.4 to 4.3 h in vivo against the pathogens tested. in vitro and in vivo results correlated well. the pae had a significantly (p less than 0.01 to 0.001) longer duration in vivo than  in vitro, but the pae of imipenem on staphylococcus aureus was longer in vitro. the pae was not due to residual antibiotics at the site of infection, and no pae  was obtained if at any time the antibiotic concentration at the infection site reached the mic for the pathogen tested. the results indicate that the presence of a pae may enable antibiotics to be given more intermittently without a loss of efficacy and that the pae can only be induced if the level of the antibiotic exceeds the mic for the pathogen in question for at least several minutes.

TI  == development of a meropenem susceptibility disc: drug content, preliminary interpretive and quality control criteria and potency bioassay.
AB  == laboratory studies were conducted to develop an appropriate susceptibility disc for meropenem. laboratory-prepared paper discs containing 5, 10, and 20 micrograms of meropenem were investigated. agar dilution mics and agar disc diffusion tests were performed with 367 rapidly growing clinical isolates by methods recommended by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls). agar disc diffusion tests with 10 micrograms meropenem discs acceptably  defined organisms as susceptible or resistant. the preliminary interpretive zone  size criteria for 10 micrograms meropenem discs were: susceptible, greater than or equal to 14 mm, and resistant, less than or equal to 10 mm, by application of  the nccls imipenem mic interpretive susceptible and resistant breakpoints to the  meropenem data. a total of 270 agar disc diffusion assays were performed with each of four atcc reference strains, using prototype discs (becton dickinson (bbl] containing 10 micrograms meropenem. the preliminary quality control limits  for agar disc diffusion tests with these discs are: escherichia coli atcc 25922,  28-32 mm; pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, 26-31 mm; staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, 33-39 mm; and enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, 19-23 mm. further studies  are necessary to re-evaluate both the preliminary interpretive and quality control criteria before definitive limits can be established. a reproducible, large plate bioassay with enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212 was developed to monitor meropenem disc potency.

TI  == comparative in-vitro activity of meropenem against clinical isolates including enterobacteriaceae with expanded-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  == meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was tested in vitro by an agar-dilution method against 373 standard strains (aerobes and anaerobes) and against nine expanded-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains and their transconjugants (5 ctx-1, 2 caz-1, 2 caz-2). meropenem was compared with methicillin, imipenem, piperacillin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin and metronidazole. meropenem and imipenem  exhibited an extended spectrum of activity, with low mics. only methicillin-resistant staphylococci, and pseudomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia were resistant. of the carbapenems, imipenem was more active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci and enterococcus faecalis, but meropenem was markedly more active against all the enterobacteriaceae and some pseudomonads. both had similar activity against ps. aeruginosa, acinetobacter spp. and anaerobes. the carbapenem mics were very low for enterol acteriaceae producing the expanded-spectrum beta-lactamases. against ctx-1-producing strains resistant to cefotaxime and ceftazidime and against caz-1 or caz-2-producers highly resistant to ceftazidime meropenem was the most active, with mics lower (0.03-0.12 mg/l) than those of imipenem (0.06-0.5 mg/l), for wild type producers and their transconjugants.

TI  == in vitro activity of cp-65,207, a new penem antimicrobial agent, in comparison with those of other agents.
AB  == cp-65,207 is a new parenteral penem antibiotic with a broad spectrum that includes gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic microorganisms, with mics for 90% (mic90s) of the majority of 1,101 clinical pathogens tested being less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. the compound was from 10- to 100-fold more active than cefoxitin and broad-spectrum cephalosporins against gram-positive bacteria and anaerobes. cp-65,207 was less active than imipenem for staphylococci, group a streptococci, and enterococcus faecalis. against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, cp-65,207 was in general 100-fold more active than cefoxitin, 5- to 10-fold more active than broad-spectrum cephalosporins, and 2-fold more active than imipenem. fresh clinical isolates that were resistant to  broad-spectrum cephalosporins were highly susceptible to cp-65,207 and imipenem (mic90, 1 microgram/ml). isolates of enterococcus faecalis, serratia marcescens,  and anaerobic peptococcus spp. had mic90s of 8, 2, and 3.12 micrograms/ml, respectively. cp-65,207 was not very active against methicillin-resistant staphylococci or pseudomonas aeruginosa. killing kinetics showed that against some strains cp-65,207 is rapidly bactericidal at concentrations well below those required to achieve a similar degree of killing with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone. cp-65,207 was only slightly susceptible to hydrolysis by type i cephalosporinases and tem-1, shv-1, and pse-2 plasmid-encoded enzymes. it had the highest affinity for penicillin-binding proteins 2, 1a, 1b, and 3 in cell-free preparations of escherichia coli w-7.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activities of qa-241, a new tricyclic quinolone derivative.
AB  == the in vitro susceptibilities of 1,310 clinical isolates to qa-241, a novel tricyclic quinolone, were evaluated in comparison with susceptibilities to norfloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, and ciprofloxacin. the mics of qa-241 for 90% of staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis isolates, and streptococcal species ranged from 1.56 to 6.25 micrograms/ml, and the activity of qa-241 was similar to those of norfloxacin and enoxacin but two to four times less potent than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. at the concentration of less than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml, qa-241 inhibited 90% of haemophilus influenzae, bordetella pertussis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and gram-negative enteric bacteria except for serratia marcescens and citrobacter freundii. qa-241 was moderately active (mic for 90% of strains tested, 6.25 to 12.5 micrograms/ml) against s. marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, xanthomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis. the antibacterial activity of qa-241 was roughly comparable to that of enoxacin but two to four times less potent than that of ofloxacin. in systemic infections in mice with gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods, the efficacy of qa-241 was  generally greater than that of norfloxacin and similar to those of ofloxacin and  ciprofloxacin. in urinary tract infections in mice with escherichia coli or pseudomonas aeruginosa, qa-241 was as active as ofloxacin and more active than norfloxacin but less active than ciprofloxacin. in pulmonary infections in mice with klebsiella pneumoniae, the effectiveness of qa-241 was similar to that of ofloxacin.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of piperacillin-tazobactam and ticarcillin-clavulanate.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ticarcillin, piperacillin, clavulanic acid, tazobactam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, and piperacillin-tazobactam against 819 bacterial isolates were compared. the two beta-lactamase inhibitors, clavulanic acid and tazobactam, had little useful antibacterial activity but enhanced the activities of the penicillins against beta-lactamase-producing strains of haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus; all strains were susceptible to both combinations. both enzyme inhibitors also enhanced the activities of the penicillins against most strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., citrobacter diversus, proteus spp., providencia spp., and bacteroides spp. and against occasional strains of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., and serratia marcescens. clavulanic acid frequently enhanced the activity of ticarcillin against xanthomonas maltophilia,  and tazobactam frequently enhanced the activity of piperacillin against morganella morganii. enhancement was observed primarily with strains relatively resistant to the penicillins. in general, clavulanic acid was more effective than tazobactam in enhancing penicillin activity against klebsiella spp., c. diversus, x. maltophilia, and bacteroides spp., whereas tazobactam was more effective against escherichia coli and proteeae. there was little or no enhancement of activity against enterococcus faecalis, aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, or acinetobacter anitratus. clavulanic acid occasionally antagonized the activity of ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible members of the family enterobacteriaceae, but those strains were still considered susceptible to the combination. tazobactam never antagonized the activity of piperacillin. in a direct comparison of the activities of ticarcillin-clavulanate and piperacillin-tazobactam, the two were equally active against h. influenzae, b. catarrhalis, and s. aureus; the latter was more active against e. faecalis. for relatively susceptible strains of members of the family enterobacteriaceae, neither combination was predictably more active than the other, but relatively resistant strains were generally more  susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. piperacillin-tazobactam was more active than ticarcillin-clavulanate against a. hydrophila, p. aeruginosa, and p. cepacia, similar in activity against a. anitratus, and less active against x. maltophilia and bacteroides spp.

AB  == the comparative in vitro activity of sm7338 was tested against 670 routine clinical isolates and 130 cefoperazone-resistant isolates of bacteria by agar dilution methods. sm7338 was at least as active as imipenem against gram-negative organisms but was slightly less active against gram-positive organisms. sm7338 was particularly active against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, with mics for 90% of strains of less than or equal to 0.125 micrograms/ml for all species tested. differences in activity between sm7338 and imipenem were particularly striking against proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, and morganella morganii, against which mics of sm7338 and imipenem for 90% of strains were 0.125 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. the presence of unique plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases in pseudomonas aeruginosa pu21 transconjugants did not affect activity substantially, except in the case of oxa-2 (eightfold-increased mic) and oxa-3 (fourfold-increased mic). sm7338 was also active against a laboratory-derived strain of p. aeruginosa which hyperproduced chromosomal beta-lactamase, inhibiting both the wild type and the mutant at a concentration of 1.0 micrograms/ml.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluoro-quinolone.
AB  == lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. in this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated  antimicrobials. lomefloxacin was very active against enterobacteriaceae (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). in common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of neisseria spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), haemophilus spp. (mic90, less  than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), legionella spp. (mic90, less than or equal  to 0.06 micrograms/ml), vibrio spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 1 microgram/ml). lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of bacteroides spp. (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) or clostridium difficile mic90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of clostridium perfringens (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), peptostreptococcus spp. (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), chlamydia trachomatis (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), mycoplasma hominis (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), and urea-plasma urealyticum (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the mic with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of escherichia coli and s. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the mic. these results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections  caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by s. aureus.

AB  == the bacterial activity of lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens was compared using kill-kinetic methods to assess inhibitory (1 x mic)  and suprainhibitory (4 x mic) concentrations. five strains each of the following  microorganisms were studied: streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. we found that lomefloxacin was 8- to 16-fold less active than ciprofloxacin as measured by mics. however, the bactericidal activities of both lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin were comparable when concentrations 1 x mic and 4 x mic were tested. for many of  the isolates tested, such concentrations would be achieved clinically. the low mics seen for the gram-negative bacilli did not correlate with killing ability for either drug: concentrations 8-16 x mic were needed for 99.9% killing of the final inoculum. although higher concentrations of lomefloxacin are needed for inhibitory and bactericidal activity, the improved pharmacokinetics of lomefloxacin may result in this agent being comparable to ciprofloxacin.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == sensibility assay for topical agents. a new method.
AB  == we present a new laboratory method to test the sensibility of clinically isolated strains to topical agents. it is a method of dilution of the whole cream in a solid medium. the cream is weighted, suspended in sterile water, and maintained at 45 degrees c. then a volume of that suspension is added to the agar, maintained at 45 degrees c also. the mixture is agitated and plated. afterwards 25 strains are inoculated by a multinoculator (cetin, bs. as., argentina). after  incubation (18 hours at 37 degrees c), the results are obtained by observing the  presence or absence of bacterial development. the minimal inhibitory concentration is calculated as the lowest concentration that inhibited growth. it is a simple, economical, and reproducible method.

TI  == [effects of sulbactam on the activity of cefoperazone against various clinical isolates].
AB  == sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz) have been used in clinical infusion at ratios of 1:1 and 1:2 in japan and u.s.a., respectively. after an administration of these drugs as a 1:1 parenteral formulation, the ratio of levels of cpz and sbt in blood was 1:1/4 to 1:1/5 for 1 to 2 hours, whereas the ratio of free, unbound drug levels was 1:1.4 to 1:1.5. in urine these drugs were excreted at a ratio between 1:1 and 1:4 during 6 hours after the infusion. antimicrobial interaction  studies using various combinations of cpz and sbt were performed to obtain information with respect to the effect of sbt on the antimicrobial activity of cpz in vivo and the most appropriate ratio of these drugs for the in vitro test system. antimicrobial activities were determined using the agar dilution method and the disk diffusion susceptibility test. sbt increased the activity of cpz against various clinical isolates tested except enterococcus faecalis. cpz-sbt at a fixed ratio of 1:1/5 significantly increased the antimicrobial activity of cpz, resulting in decreases in mic values and increases in disk inhibitory zone diameters. these drugs at ratios 1:1 to 1:3 maximized the synergistic enhancement of the activity. therefore, a fixed ratio between 1:1/5 and 1:1 would be appropriate for the in vitro antimicrobial test system using either the agar dilution method or the disk susceptibility test. based on pharmacokinetic data for cpz and sbt, results of the present study on antimicrobial activity would support that the parenteral formulation of cpz-sbt at the fixed ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 for the intravenous infusion used in japan and u.s.a., respectively, are appropriate. the effect of sbt on the activity of cpz was more marked against clinical isolates with greater production abilities of beta-lactamase than against those with less production abilities. sbt/cpz, however, exerted a synergistic effect against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus without beta-lactamase production. the mic80 of sbt/cpz (1:1) against various clinical isolates with 10(6) cfu/ml inoculum size were as follows: s. aureus 12.5 micrograms/ml, staphylococcus epidermis 3.13 micrograms/ml, and e. faecalis 50 micrograms/ml. those of gram-negative bacilli were: escherichia coli 0.20 microgram/ml, klebsiella pneumoniae 0.20 micrograms/ml, proteus mirabilis 0.78 microgram/ml, proteus vulgaris 0.78 microgram/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa 12.5 micrograms/ml, serratia marcescens 25 micrograms/ml, enterobacter spp. 3.13 micrograms/ml, citrobacter spp. 12.5 micrograms/ml and acinetobacter spp. 0.78 microgram/ml.

AB  == the in vitro activity of enoxacin was tested in 14 german microbiological centers shortly after the introduction of the drug in germany. 2748 unselected clinical isolates including 15 bacterial species were analysed using microtiter plates. the mic90-values were as follows: staphylococcus aureus 4 mg/l, enterococcus faecalis 16 mg/l, enterobacteriaceae 0.5 mg/l, pseudomonas aeruginosa 8 mg/l. there is good correlation between these results and those of former investigations. it is known that quinolones are only moderately active against enterococci. 8.5% of s. aureus, and 1.4% of enterobacteriaceae were found to be resistant (mic greater than 4 mg/l). as to p. aeruginosa, the study revealed that despite a generally low rate of resistance in specific clinical settings, specific problems can arise: in one institution, the mic90 of p. aeruginosa was 32 mg/l, with a resistance rate of 56.1% (n = 57). in the other centers the mic90 was 2 mg/l and the resistance rate 5.0% (n = 302). in the first center, many of the isolates were from paraplegic patients or patients with cystic fibrosis pretreated with quinolones. this study will be repeated in two years' time in order to determine an eventual change in resistance.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == fk482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. it displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (cfix), cefaclor (ccl) or cephalexin (cex) against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci including staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the streptococcus group. moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, fk482  had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of cfix but superior to that of ccl or cex. however, it was clearly inferior to cfix in activity against serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. strains of s. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to fk482. all tested strains of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ccl and cex were susceptible to fk482, as were all the strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (ampc). fk482, like cfix, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of ccl or cex. the antibacterial activity of fk482 against csh2  strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. fk482 showed higher affinity  for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) (3, 2 and 1) of s. aureus than did cfix, ccl and cex. fk482 also showed very high affinity for the pbps (2 and 3) of e. faecalis and pbps (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of e. coli. the bactericidal activity of fk482 against s. aureus was almost as strong as that of ampc and superior to that of ccl or cex. against gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, fk482 was similar to cfix and superior to ccl and cex in bactericidal activity.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of cefoperazone. evaluation of disc susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  == to interpret of the cefoperazone (cpz) disc susceptibility test, a 4 category system is used in japan, but a 3 category system is used in the u.s.a. and europe. in the 4 category interpretation system of showa cpz disc the following classification is used: ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3 approximately 15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15 approximately 60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. in the 3 category system the classification used is as follows: susceptible mic less than  or equal to 16 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible mic greater than 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, resistant mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, or susceptible mic less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible mic greater than 32 approximately 64 micrograms/ml, resistant mic greater than 64 micrograms/ml, depending on dose levels, 1 or 2 g. reliability of the cpz disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate mics by classifying the test results into 4 categories was studied using discs containing 1, 2, 5, 10, 30 and  75 micrograms. the mics were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. a good negative correlation was observed between  inhibitory zone diameters and mics, showing reliability of the test using these discs. the results obtained with discs containing 30 or 75 micrograms of cpz were well categorized into the 4 groups mentioned above. some strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, however, showed false positive results. when different break points of inhibitory zone diameters than those used for other bacteria were used for p. aeruginosa, and e. faecalis was excluded from the test, an excellent correlations were obtained. with 30 or 75 micrograms discs, it was unable to subclassify strains against which mics of cpz were below 3 micrograms/ml. however, with discs containing 1 to 10 micrograms, it was possible to separate the strains against which mics were less than 0.5 microgram/ml. the fact that most frequent values of mics of cpz against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp., haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes etc. were less than 0.5 microgram/ml supports the usefulness of low dose discs. according to recently ongoing concepts on the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics and their penetration into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding appear to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except into hepatic biliary system.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == a further insight into the mechanism of action of anthracycline antibiotics.
AB  == the uptake of adriamycin (adm) by eucaryotic and procaryotic cells and the interaction of the antibiotic with structurally organized dna were investigated.  the aim of this work was to understand why adm is endowed with very low antibiotic activity in spite of being highly cytotoxic for mammalian cells, and to get a further insight into the mechanism of action of this compound. spectrophotometric, fluorometric, chiroptical, and electron microscopic techniques were used. the drug was shown to concentrate in mammalian cells but failed to do so in bacteria and penetrated rather poorly in candida albicans. the chromatin binding affinity of adm appeared to be substantially reduced with respect to the affinity for free dna. complex stereochemistry was also influenced by the presence of nucleosomal arrangements in the polynucleotide. in addition, evidence was obtained that the antibiotic tended to accumulate at specific (linker) chromatin regions and to cause extensive compaction of organized dna. the observed phenomena may play a relevant role in the mode of drug action in eucaryotic cells and help to explain the lack of antibacterial activity by adm in spite of the apparent attainment of great enough intracellular levels to affect dna template function.

TI  == phosphinic acid inhibitors of d-alanyl-d-alanine ligase.
AB  == we report the synthesis of a series of phosphinic acid dipeptide analogues, nh2ch(r1)po(oh)ch2ch(r2)co2h, related to dala-dala. the best of these compounds are potent, essentially irreversible inhibitors of dala-dala ligase, and their preferred stereochemistry was shown by chiral synthesis of (1(s)-aminoethyl)(2(r)-carboxy-1-n-propyl)phosphinic acid, 12b, and by x-ray crystallography of its derivative benzyl [1(s)-[(benzyloxycarbonyl)-amino]ethyl](2(r)-carbomethoxy-1-propyl) phosphinate,  13, to correspond to the stereochemical configuration of dala-dala at both centers. a mechanism for the inhibition of dala-dala ligase by these compounds is proposed to involve an atp-dependent formation of phosphorylated inhibitor within the enzyme's active site. the antibacterial activities of these compounds are modest although their spectra include both gram-positive and gram-negative susceptible organisms. the best antibacterial activity was shown by (1(s)-aminoethyl) [2-carboxy-2(r)-(methylthio)-1-ethyl]phosphinic acid, 3e, whose mic's range from 4-128 micrograms/ml on nine of a panel of 11 bacterial organisms. combination of one of the more active phosphinic acids 12b with the alanine racemase inhibitor fluoro-d-alanine enhances the antibacterial spectrum of the latter on several strains of bacteria and inhibits fluoro-d-alanine's self-reversal, which normally occurs at concentrations several fold higher than its mic level. this inhibition of fluoro-d-alanine self-reversal is consistent with an involvement of dala-dala ligase inhibition in the antibacterial activity  of these compounds.

TI  == microbiology of indwelling central intravascular catheters.
AB  == indwelling central-line catheters (n = 502) from 362 patients in intensive care units were analyzed prospectively. the skin site, 6-cm-distal and -proximal subcutaneous segments of the catheter, exudates, and blood were cultured. semiqualitative roll plate cultures of the catheter segments were followed by broth cultures and examined for 72 h. all isolates were identified, and susceptibilities were determined. line infections, defined clinically, yielded 22 different microbial species; 10 different species were recovered from colonized lines. of the staphylococcus epidermidis isolates recovered, 39% occurred singly  and 21% occurred in combination with other microorganisms; enterococcus faecalis, s. hominis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were next in frequency of isolation. line  infections also yielded other staphylococci, viridans group streptococci, several members of the family enterobacteriaceae, acinetobacters, anaerobic bacteria, candida spp., and aspergillus fumigatus. while s. epidermidis was also the most frequent isolate among the line colonizers, different species and different frequencies of isolation were found among this group. the study showed that the distal catheter segment broth culture was the best predictor of clinical line infections; in addition, gram-negative bacteria were isolated only from the catheters of patients with overt infections.

TI  == [nosocomial infections of the urinary tract in urology patients].
AB  == researches effected in different nations have revealed that 5-12% of all hospitalized patients was affected with a nosocomial infection and that almost 1/3 of these were urinary tract infections. the hospitalized urological patients  have a considerable proneness to contract a nosocomial urinary tract infection, because they are subjected to transurethral or suprapubic bladder catheterisms, to transurethral surgery and to the endoscopies, that are promoting maneuvers the urinary tract infections. generally the gram negative bacilli are the cause of hospital-acquired urinary tract infections, even if lately gram positive bacilli  (especially streptococcus faecalis or enterococcus), "gram negative facultative pathogens" (klebsiella, providencia, citrobacter, serratia) and fungi are very important. considering the importance of these infections we have examined the incidence of the urinary tract infections of the hospitalized patients between january 1, 1986 and december 31, 1986 in our urologic institute. during the 12-month study interval there were 450 hospital admissions, and 45 patients were  affected with a nosocomial urinary tract infection (10%). the females were affected at the rate of 6.7% of them, with an incidence of 4.7% among all patients with a positive urine culture; on the contrary the males were affected at the rate of 11.4% of them, equal to 19.0% of patients with a positive urine culture. we have noticed that among the responsible microorganisms for the nosocomial urinary tract infections, the group of the "gram negative facultative  pathogens" was more frequent (40%), followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida species. so also in our urologic institute the modification of the responsible agents for the nosocomial urinary tract infections happened. the nosocomial infections after the discovery of the antibiotics were considered wiped out, on the contrary these infections are still an important problem of public health, so that efficaciously must be tackled.

AB  == in vitro activities of latamoxef (lmox) against 249 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. lmox was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis (except 2 out of 30 strains) and proteus vulgaris with mic values below 3.13 micrograms/ml. it was also active against enterobacter aerogenes with mic80  of 1.56 micrograms/ml. lmox was less active against serratia marcescens, inhibiting about 43% of strains at a level of 6.25 micrograms/ml. it was also less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, showing mic80 of 12.5 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. lmox was not active against enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the reliability of the lmox disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (difco), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of lmox. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the lmox disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of lmox. for the interpretation of lmox disc test results, if uniform break points of zone diameters were used to test all bacteria, inhibitory zone diameters of showa discs used on staphylococcus were relatively large compared to mics determined, probably due to decarboxylation of lmox sodium salt in the discs. however, those of difco discs were not, because difco discs use lmox ammonium salt. both discs also showed relatively large inhibitory zone diameters  compared to mics determined against p. aeruginosa. using different break points from those used for other bacteria to interpret inhibition zones for staphylococcus and p. aeruginosa, these disc susceptivility tests should be useful to estimate approximate mics. a 3 category system for the interpretation of disc test results has been used in usa and europe, but a 4 category system is  generally used in japan. the 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to mic values as follows:  resistant (r) mic greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml, intermediate (i) mic 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (s) mic less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. the 4 category system uses break points as follows: mic less than  or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == the in vitro activity of cefpirome (hr 810), a new cephalosporin antibiotic having a 2,3-cyclopentenopyridine group in the 3-position side chain, was compared with in vitro activities of 5 other cephalosporins. hr 810 showed a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative  bacteria when tested using 71 standard strains and 876 clinical isolates. hr 810  inhibited 70% of the clinically isolated staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis strains when used at 0.59-0.84 microgram/ml, 2- to 25-fold lower than values of reference antibiotics, and the compound was also highly effective against enterococcus faecalis which is relatively resistant to most of the existing cephem antibiotics. the activity of hr 810 against enterobacteriaceae members (11 species), based on its minimal inhibitory concentrations inhibiting 90% of bacterial growth (mic90s), was the highest among the cephalosporins used.  especially against enterobacter species and citrobacter freundii, the mic90s of the compound were 4- to 64-fold lower than the values of the other antibiotics. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, hr 810 was as active as cefoperazone, an antipseudomonal agent. the minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of hr 810 were equal to or only 2-fold greater than the mics for most of 12 standard strains tested. the compound markedly decreased viable bacterial counts at its mics, thus showing strong bactericidal activities. the in vitro activity of hr 810 was not affected by ph or human serum content of agar media, but the activity against gram-negative bacteria was lowered as the inoculum size increased.

AB  == nine hundred seventy cases of childhood bacterial meningitis treated at 107 institutions in japan from 1979 through 1984 were studied using questionnaire. the number of cases that underwent antimicrobial monotherapy remained nearly constant during the study period, but cases of therapies with beta-lactam combined with aminoglycosides (ags) decreased in number and a gradual increase in the use of beta-lactam combined with non-ags antibiotics including beta-lactam (non ags) was observed. a trend showing decrease in case fatality rate (cfr) was  observed except that cfr for gram-positive bacterial infections treated with beta-lactam + ags remained at a same level. cases treated with antibiotics were classified into 3 groups according to major etiological pathogens. cases with staphylococcus aureus gave a poor prognosis, among 27 total cases, cfr was 28.6%  (2/7) with monotherapy, 50.0% (6/12) with beta-lactam + ags and 37.5% (3/8) with  beta-lactam + non ags (p less than 0.1). among 100 cases of group b streptococcus (gbs), cfr was 20.0% as a whole, 17.3% (9/52) for monotherapy and 34.5% (10/29) for beta-lactam + ags (p less than 0.1). among 198 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae, cfr was 12.1% as a whole, and was 12.3% (18/146) with monotherapy. cfr for the cases treated with beta-lactam + ags was 20.8% (5/24) and with beta-lactam + non ags was 3.6% (1/28) (p less than 0.1). cfr for 292 cases of haemophilus influenzae meningitis was fairly low, and was 6.1% (9/148) with monotherapy, 7.4% (5/68) with beta-lactam + ags and 3.9% (3/76) with beta-lactam  + non ags, thus very slight differences were observed among the 3 groups of treatment. among 111 cases of escherichia coli, monotherapy and beta-lactam + non ags gave 6.5% (2/31) cfr, and 5.6% (1/18) cfr, respectively, whereas beta-lactam  + ags showed cfr of 19.4% (12/62), demonstrating a significant difference tendency (p less than 0.1). similar tendencies were observed in the cases of listeria monocytogenes, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis. contrary to the high cfr observed with the beta-lactam + ags treatment, significantly low cfr was frequently obtained in cases treated with a combination of penicillins with cephalosporins including latamoxef or beta-lactam with chloramphenicol. infections with gbs, e. coli, and p. mirabilis  occurred largely in the age between 0 to 6 months and cfr was especially high in  the very young.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == efficacy and safety of oral ciprofloxacin for treatment of serious urinary tract  infections.
AB  == eighty-three patients with serious urinary tract infections were treated with oral ciprofloxacin. of these patients, 79 were hospitalized, and 41 had known structural or neurologic abnormalities of the urinary tract. the most common pathogens were members of the family enterobacteriaceae (mics, less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml), pseudomonas aeruginosa (mics, 0.13 to 2 micrograms/ml), and enterococcus faecalis (mics, 0.5 to 2 micrograms/ml). sixty-eight patients were able to be evaluated for determining efficacy; all responded symptomatically, and all urinary pathogens were eradicated on days 3 to 5 of treatment. five patients, who were treated for a relatively short duration (2 to  10 days), relapsed 5 to 9 days posttreatment. six patients became colonized with  yeasts during treatment, and seven patients developed bacterial reinfections 5 to 9 days posttreatment. all patients whose infections relapsed or who developed infections with new organisms had neurogenic bladders, structural abnormalities of the genitourinary tract, or urinary catheters. there was no instance of bacteria developing resistance during treatment. ciprofloxacin probably caused nausea with or without vomiting in 7 of the 83 patients, headache in 3 patients,  and mild elevation of hepatic enzymes in 2 patients; other adverse reactions were observed but were probably not drug related. oral ciprofloxacin was effective and safe for the treatment of serious urinary tract infections caused by a variety of bacterial pathogens.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of ceftizoxime. observation from mic and ceftizoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  == in vitro activities of ceftizoxime (czx) against 328 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. czx was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and proteus vulgaris with mic values below 0.20 microgram/ml. it was also active against serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes with mic85 of  3.13 micrograms/ml. czx was less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, showing inhibitory activities against only 47 and 78% of these clinical isolates, respectively, at a dose level of 12.5 micrograms/ml.  czx was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis. the  reliability of czx disc diffusion susceptibility tests for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter  discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (eiken), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of czx. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the czx disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of czx, except against p. aeruginosa and e.  faecalis. for the interpretation of czx disc tests, a 3 category system has been  used in usa and europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in japan. the 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to mic values as follows: resistant (r) mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (ms) mic 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (s) mic less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at  250 words)

TI  == the sensitivity of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to ofloxacin.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of ofloxacin, a new fluorinated quinolone, was evaluated against 165 gram-negative rods, both fermentative and non-fermentative and against 57 gram-positive strains (coagulase-positive and -negative, staphylococci both methicillin-resistant and susceptible and streptococcus faecalis). minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by using the macrodilution test and activity was compared with nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, ampicillin, piperacillin, ceftazidime and gentamicin for gram-negative rods, norfloxacin and gentamicin for staphylococcus strains, and norfloxacin, ampicillin, piperacillin and gentamicin for enterococci. ofloxacin inhibited all fermentative gram-negative bacteria tested, in a range of 0.05-3.12 micrograms/ml. it also had good antimicrobial activity against non-fermentative gram-negative strains: in fact it inhibited 90% of acinetobacter and 80% of pseudomonas aeruginosa tested at 3.12 micrograms/ml. ofloxacin had good antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus and enterococcus tested.

TI  == the effect of transferrin and lysozyme on antibacterial activity of amniotic fluid.
AB  == amniotic fluid obtained from normal full term gestation inhibited the growth of e. coli, staph. aureus and b. subtilis, while ps. aeruginosa, str. faecalis and str. agalactiae proliferated readily in amniotic fluid. but when amniotic fluid was heated at 100 degrees c for 5 minutes, its antibacterial activity was completely lost. the levels of transferrin and lysozyme in amniotic fluid at term were determined to be 29.1 +/- 17.6 mg/100 ml (n = 90) and 19.1 +/- 8.3 micrograms/ml (n = 145), respectively. antibacterial activity against e. coli was restored by adding transferrin into heat-treated amniotic fluid at a concentration of 250 mg/100 ml or higher, but simultaneous addition of transferrin and sufficient concentration of iron to form a transferrin-iron complex resulted in the loss of antibacterial activities. when lysozyme was added to the amniotic fluid, which had lost its antibacterial activity through exposure to heat, the antibacterial effect on b. subtilis was restored. the growth of staph. aureus in heat-treated amniotic fluid was inhibited by the concomitant addition of lysozyme and aminobenzyl penicillin.

AB  == we identified 29 episodes of suppurative thrombophlebitis in 27 patients admitted to a large general hospital between may 1980 and may 1984. in 25 patients, the intravenous cannulae had been in place for more than 3 days. streptococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa or one of the enterobacteriaceae were implicated in 14 patients. all these patients had recently undergone abdominal surgery or had a major intra-abdominal inflammatory process at the time they developed thrombophlebitis. the remaining 13 patients were infected with staphylococcus aureus, other gram-positive cocci or candida species. only two of these had an active abdominal process at the time of their infection (chi 2 = 16.08, p less than 0.001). there is an apparent association between phlebitis caused by enteric organisms and active intra-abdominal pathology. there were two deaths related to  delayed or deferred surgery. suppurative thrombophlebitis is a lethal, preventable nosocomial infection that requires urgent surgical intervention.

AB  == mk-0787 (imipenem)/mk-0791 (cilastatin sodium), a new compound of thienamycin, was administered in treatment of 35 patients (36 cases) with chronic complicated  uti or for prevention of serious infections with much complicated factors. the patients were principally treated at a daily dose of 1 g for over 10 days. the efficacy rate of 26 patients who were evaluable in the early phase (4-7 days) was 88.5%, while it became up to 92.3% in the final phase judgment. as for clinical usefulness, the result was obtained to be as high as that of the clinical efficacy. in bacteriological study, 35 strains were clinically isolated including 7 strains of p. aeruginosa from uti. all the strains disappeared with an eradication rate of 100% after treatment. strains appearing after imipenem/cilastatin sodium treatment mainly consisted of fungi. usefulness judgements tended to be greater in the final phase than in the early phase. as for side effects, vomiting was recorded in one case, in which the administration  was discontinued. in laboratory findings there were 3 cases with elevated gpt, 2  cases with elevated got, one case with elevated gamma-gtp, one with thrombocytopenia, and one with eosinophilia each, but these abnormal values were  slight and transient. in summary our clinical study showed that imipenem/cilastatin sodium was a very effective antibiotic in treatment on moderate or serious uti or preventive use for infections in compromised hosts. considering the features of this agent, it might be more effective and useful for clinical use in treatment on polymicrobial infections including stubborn organisms than any other antimicrobial compounds. furthermore, it was safe and well tolerable in a long term treatment.

TI  == sepsis and cholestasis: the in vitro effects of bacterial products on 14c-taurocholate uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.
AB  == bacterial endotoxins are known to be an important cause of cholestasis, yet not all organisms that cause cholestasis produce endotoxins. in order to determine whether bacterial products other than endotoxins may be involved in the cholestasis process, 14c-taurocholate (tc) uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes was measured in the presence of mid-log, stationary and mid-death phase bacterial broth supernatants from eight common bacterial pathogens. the results were then correlated with a quantitative assessment of endotoxin production by each organism. supernatants from haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumonia demonstrated a striking inhibitory effect on bile salt uptake (77.2 +/- 6.7, 46.9 +/- 6.5 and 32.9 +/- 7.1% maximum inhibition of 14c-tc uptake, respectively) when compared to sterile broth controls. streptococcus faecalis (enterococcus), escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and bacteroides  fragilis products, on the other hand, had relatively minor effects (12.3 +/- 5.2, 12.0 +/- 7.5, 8.4 +/- 6.7 and less than 5.0% inhibition respectively), while those from proteus mirabilis had an intermediate effect (18.5 +/- 8.3% inhibition). bile salt efflux rates (16.0 +/- 2.7 and 25.1 +/- 4.2 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, mean +/- sem) were similar in bacteria demonstrating marked uptake inhibition (haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) when compared to those with only minor inhibitory effects (staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis) (14.3 +/- 1.1 and 18.4 +/- 2.6 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, respectively, p greater than 0.05). 14c-tc uptake inhibition did not correlate with the amount of endotoxin produced by each organism (r = 0.251). the results of this study indicate that bacteria produce a factor other than endotoxin that significantly inhibits bile salt uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == review of imipenem.
AB  == imipenem, a new carbapenem beta-lactam broad-spectrum antibiotic, is highly active in vitro against most aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from infectious diseases of human beings. except  for enterococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococci most gram-positive cocci  are inhibited by less than 2 micrograms/ml. although the mic-90 of methicillin-resistant staphylococci may be less than 4 micrograms/ml, these bacteria are usually resistant to imipenem by modified testing methods. the enterococcus, s. faecalis, has an mic-90 of less than 8 micrograms/ml but bactericidal concentration may be much higher. most enterobacteriaceae are highly susceptible to imipenem with mic-90 of 0.5 to 2.0 micrograms/ml. proteus species  are less susceptible with mics of 4 to 8 micrograms/ml. isolates of p. aeruginosa have variable susceptibility with mics ranging from 0.25 to 16 micrograms/ml. pseudomonas maltophilia and p. cepacia are usually resistant to imipenem. except  for clostridium species, most strict anaerobes are susceptible to less than 1.0 micrograms/ml of imipenem. when combined with cilastatin (1:1 ratio), the renal elimination of the active form is increased. the serum halflife in normal renal function is about 1 hour and increases to 3.4 hours in anuria. major adverse effects are similar to those of cephalosporins except for seizures in some patients. colonization with fungi and drug-resistant bacteria occurs in about 5%  of imipenem-treated patients. clinical studies have demonstrated efficacy in 79%  to 96% of patients treated.

AB  == many different infections including urinary tract infections occur in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. furthermore, in most cases, it is practically impossible to clearly identify causative organisms as in cases of pelvic peritonitis and parametritis. in many incidents, causative organisms consist mainly of escherichia coli, and recently, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, etc. have also been identified. because the new antibiotic, imipenem/cilastatin sodium (mk-0787/mk-0791), is very effective against these bacteria, and because of its wide spectrum, we believe it is especially effective against infections of obstetrics and gynecology. the distribution of this antibiotic into various organs and tissues was similar to other drugs, and it reaches a high level in internal genital organs, hence it should be effective for the treatment of obstetric/gynecological infections. its toxicity is low also, and no side effects nor abnormal laboratory findings were observed in our trials. results of our trials are summarized below: of 9 cases of obstetric/gynecological infections, the antibiotic showed excellent effectiveness against 2, good against 6, for the  efficacy ratio of 89%. no side effects nor abnormal laboratory findings were observed.

TI  == immunocompromised animal models for the study of antibiotic combinations.
AB  == studies of various models of pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in neutropenic animals have demonstrated the superiority of the combination of beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics when compared with a single drug alone. a limited number of studies carried out in models of klebsiella pneumoniae infections in neutropenic animals have shown similar results. the efficacy of double beta-lactam combinations for the treatment of gram-negative bacillary infections  has not been studied as extensively; the few available reports did not show any benefit over a single beta-lactam treatment. most studies of combined therapy in  gram-positive infections have been performed in the experimental endocarditis model. experiments in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus viridans, and streptococcus faecalis endocarditis have shown a clear-cut advantage for combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment over single beta-lactam therapy, as predicted by in vitro tests. the enhanced efficacy of combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment in both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections appears to result in most studies in increased and faster killing of the bacteria. with p. aeruginosa infections, however, experiments in neutropenic mice suggest that in addition to increased killing, the beta-lactam arm of the combined treatment prevents the emergence of the small colony variants that lead to treatment failures during therapy with aminoglycoside alone. for both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections, in vitro tests that demonstrated synergism for the combined antibiotics generally predicted enhanced therapeutic efficacy in vivo. conversely, when no synergism was demonstrated in vitro, there was generally no increased efficacy of combined treatment in vivo. animal models add a dimension to our understanding of the efficacy of antibiotics, both singly and in combination, that is not always apparent from the results of in vitro tests alone. these in vivo tests can be of value when planning clinical trials.

AB  == pefloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. a comparison was made of the in-vitro activity of pefloxacin and that of nine other antibiotics (ampicillin, ticarcillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin, amikacin and norfloxacin). the mic90 of pefloxacin against 500 strains of enterobacteriaceae ranged from 0.25 mg/l (escherichia coli, indole + proteus spp., enterobacter cloacae, salmonella spp. and shigella spp.) to 1 mg/l (klebsiella pneumoniae). pefloxacin inhibited 90% of 52 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa at 2.5 mg/l (range 0.25 mg/l-4 mg/l). the mic90 of pefloxacin against 100 staphylococcus aureus strains (78 oxacillin resistant strains) was 0.4 mg/l (range 0.12-0.5 mg/l). it was markedly less active against streptococcus faecalis and str. pneumoniae (37 strains of each species) the mic90 being 4 mg/l against both species. overall, pefloxacin was at least as active as the third-generation cephalosporins against enterobacteriaceae and was more active than any other antibiotic tested against p. aeruginosa, s. epidermidis, and s. aureus. against e. coli, pefloxacin had a more rapid anti-bacterial activity than piperacillin. a paradoxical effect was observed with pefloxacin. an optimal killing rate was observed at concentrations of pefloxacin compatible with those one can expect in  blood of patients treated with this drug.

TI  == comparative study of selective media for enumeration of pseudomonas aeruginosa from water by membrane filtration.
AB  == in the present study, mpa-d and mpa-e agar, modifications of mpa-c agar that reduce background fecal streptococci that interfere with the differentiation and  enumeration of the pseudomonas aeruginosa colonies grown in other mpa media, are  proposed for use in analyzing natural water samples. in addition, the efficiencies of several culture media for the recovery of p. aeruginosa in water  after membrane filtration and multiple-tube techniques are compared. the degree of selectivity, precision, efficiency, and sensitivity achieved with the proposed media exceeded that achieved by current methods. furthermore, they yielded equal  rates of accuracy and specificity. incubation at 36 degrees c resulted in an improved recovery of stressed p. aeruginosa. in conclusion, we propose the use of mpa-d and mpa-e agar, both incubated at 36 degrees c for 24 to 48 h, for analyzing river water and seawater, respectively.

TI  == [a study on the antibacterial activity of amniotic fluid--the significance of intraamniotic transferrin].
AB  == in order to study the antimicrobial activity of amniotic fluid, attempts were made to evaluate the in vivo growth of bacteria in amniotic fluid and the role of transferrin in antibacterial activity. the bacteria chosen for these experiments  were escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus faecalis, respectively. the results obtained were as follows: amniotic fluid was shown have an antibacterial effect on escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus, while pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus faecalis proliferated readily in amniotic fluid. individual difference in each sample appeared to be responsible for the inconsistent potency of the inhibitory effect  observed. when amniotic fluid was heated at 100 degrees c for 5 minutes, the antibacterial activity was lost. the level of transferrin in amniotic fluid obtained at term was determined to be 29.1 +/- 17.6mg/dl (n = 90). the value correlated with neither those measured in cord sera nor maternal sera. the antimicrobial activity was restored by adding transferrin into heat-treated amniotic fluid at a concentration of 250mg/dl or higher. simultaneous addition of transferrin and a sufficient concentration of iron made it possible to form a transferrin-iron complex. a subsequent decrease in unbound transferrin resulted in the loss of antibacterial properties.

TI  == distribution of bacteria and yeasts within the 10-ml isolator during the processing of seeded blood samples.
AB  == forty-five organisms consisting of stock cultures and clinical isolates of bacteria and yeast were separately inoculated into outdated blood bank blood to achieve a concentration of approximately 100 cfu/ml. blood with each organism was introduced into groups of four isolators (e. i. du pont de nemours & co., inc., wilmington, del.), which were then processed according to the isostat instructions of the manufacturer. the supernatant, sediment, and wash (material removed from the surface of the slanted stopper after sediment removal) were inoculated onto 5% sheep blood agar plates. cultures were incubated aerobically (5 to 10% co2) at 35 degrees c for 48 to 72 h. from the 180 isolators, the mean recovery was 6% (range, 0 to 48%) for the supernatant, 87% (range, 47 to 98%) for the sediment, and 8% (range, 3 to 23%) for the wash. neither variation among technologists nor intentional misalignment of additional isolators in the centrifuge could explain all of the losses of microorganisms from the sediment. the manual nature of the isolator procedure, which led to the loss of significant amounts of organisms from the sediment, may help to explain false-negative isolator results obtained from blood of patients, particularly when small numbers of pathogens are present.

TI  == antibacterial activity of seminalplasmin, a basic protein from bovine seminal plasma.
AB  == seminalplasmin, a 6,000 dalton antimicrobial protein present in bovine seminal plasma, is shown to inhibit growth and/or rna synthesis in several bacterial species. in only one strain out of twenty one belonging to fourteen species, did  both rna synthesis and growth appear to be resistant to seminalplasmin. the antibacterial activity of seminalplasmin, in the case of e. coli, was also studied as a function of its concentration and of time; the minimal concentration of the protein required for 100% bactericidal activity was only about twice that  required for 100% bacteriostatic activity. the killing of e. coli cells proceeded in two phases, a slow phase and then a rapid one, and required several hours for  completion. several bacterial species tested secreted proteases into the medium that destroyed seminalplasmin.

AB  == the pre-operative urine, pelvic urine, removed calculi and calculus washings were examined bacteriologically in 24 patients undergoing removal of intrarenal calculi. four of seven patients with struvite calculi had an infected pre-operative midstream urine specimen and six of the seven removed calculi demonstrated significant bacterial growth. proteus mirabilis was the commonest organism isolated. of 17 patients with oxalate calculi only one had an infected pre-operative urine culture, but in four cases the removed stones were infected.  quantitative bacteriological culture of the stones and their washings demonstrated that infection is within the stone itself. pre-operative urine culture failed to predict infection within the stone in 60% of patients with infected stones. the results suggest that the presence of infected urine together with the presence of renal calculus is indication for removal of the calculus.

TI  == further characterization of bacterial adherence to urinary bladder mucosa: comparison with adherence to anion exchange resin.
AB  == bacterial adherence to anion exchange resin has recently been reported to provide a useful, rapid, in vitro screening assay for identifying putative antiadherence  agents. the studies presented in this report provide additional evidence that adherence to anion exchange resin is similar to urinary bladder mucosa adherence. results are as follows. 1) heparin inhibits the adherence of escherichia coli, klebsiella ozaenae, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus fecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa to both the mucin deficient bladder and anion exchange resin. 2) drugs which inhibit e. coli adherence to the bladder also inhibit e. coli adherence to  the resin and conversely, drugs which do not effect e. coli adherence to the resin do not affect attachment to the bladder. 3) extracts from mammalian urinary bladder mucosa prevent e. coli adherence to both the bladder and resin. 4) the ability of heparin to displace preattached bacteria from anion exchange resin is  inversely proportional to the time the bacteria are in contact with resin. similar results were obtained for the ability of heparin to displace bacteria from the bladder. these studies indicate that bacterial adherence to anion exchange resin responds to heparin and other chemical agents in a manner similar  to the mucin deficient rabbit urinary bladder. because of the ease and rapid nature of this in vitro assay, it serves as a useful screen for potential bacterial antiadherence agents and could be used to help elucidate mechanisms of  bacterial attachment.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of enoxacin was tested against 500 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli that were resistant to one or more of gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin, and against 1060 recent consecutive clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci. enoxacin was active against staphylococci (mics less than or equal to 4 mg/l) but less active against streptococcus faecalis (mics mostly 8 mg/l). it was active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mics 0.5-4 mg/l) and very active against enterobacteriaceae. in the series of consecutive isolates 97% of enterobacteriaceae had mics less than or equal to 1 mg/l. the aminoglycoside-resistant series of enterobacteriaceae included more strains with higher mics (13% were 2-4 mg/l and 10% were greater than or equal to 8 mg/l); the majority of the isolates with mics greater than or  equal to 8 mg/l); the majority of the isolates with mics greater than or equal to 8 mg/l were serratia marcescens and providencia spp. among the non-fermenting species the least sensitive were acinetobacter calcoaceticus and ps. maltophilia. enoxacin-resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae were resistant to nalidixic acid, but nalidixic acid-resistant strains ranged from fully sensitive to highly  resistant to enoxacin.

AB  == the viability and location of bacteria within infection stones were investigated. many stones were infected with urea-splitting bacteria, such as proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. large numbers of bacterial impressions and bodies were found in the interstices surrounded by crystals of apatite and struvite from the nuclei to the peripheral layers. the presence of bacterial colonies even in the nuclear portion of the stones suggests that bacteria participate in the initial stone formation as well as in growth of infection stones. streptococcus faecalis, a nonurea -splitting bacteria, also was found in some infection stones  and probably represents a superimposed infection as a result of changes in bacterial flora owing to treatment with antibiotics.

TI  == the effects of heparin on the adherence of five species of urinary tract pathogens to urinary bladder mucosa.
AB  == previous studies performed in our laboratory have indicated that the primary antibacterial defense mechanism of the rabbit urinary bladder is the antiadsorptive action of the surface mucopolysaccharide. removal of this layer with an acid rinse increases bacterial adherence up to 100 fold. exogenous mucopolysaccharide (heparin) has been shown to restore escherichia coli adherence to control levels. to determine whether this antiadherence action of heparin is species specific, we compared the adherence of 5 common urinary tract pathogens (escherichia coli, klebsiella ozonae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  and streptococcus fecalis) to both mucin intact and mucin deficient rabbit bladders with and without prior heparin exposure. bacteria were radiolabeled by addition of 3h-adenine to the culture broth so that the number of bacteria adhering to the bladder could be determined using liquid scintillation spectrophotometry. results were as follows: acid removal of the mucin layer significantly increased the adherence approximately 10 fold for all 5 species tested. briefly exposing the mucin deficient bladders to heparin decreased the adherence of all species tested except pseudomonas to mucin intact control levels. heparin treatment of mucin intact bladders slightly decreased adherence of all species except pseudomonas below mucin intact controls, however, results were not statistically significant. the magnitude of klebsiella adherence was nearly 20 fold greater than all other species tested. while this non-species specific adherence inhibition of heparin may prove useful in the clinical setting, it appears to be less effective against pseudomonas.

TI  == a microbiological evaluation of apalcillin.
AB  == the in vitro activity of apalcillin was tested against 350 clinical isolates of escherichia coli, enterobacter, klebsiella, proteus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus faecalis. using a minimal inhibitory concentration of 16 mg/l as the breakpoint, only 19.7% of the strains were resistant to apalcillin. a regression analysis demonstrated that it is possible to test bacteria for sensitivity with a 20 micrograms apalcillin disc. the results on mueller-hinton agar are very similar to those on iso-sensitest medium. like other ureido penicillins, apalcillin is sensitive to most beta-lactamases; it is effective against ampicillin-resistant strains since it penetrates the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria well and is highly effective against target proteins. strains producing high amounts of beta-lactamases do become resistant to apalcillin.

TI  == removal of bacteria from water by adhesion to cross-linked poly(vinylpyridinium halide).
AB  == cross-linked poly(vinylpyridinium halide) was found to have a novel and remarkable ability to remove bacteria from water. for example, when 10 g (wet weight) of cross-linked poly(n-benzyl-4-vinylpyridinium bromide) was contacted with 20 ml of suspensions of escherichia coli (9.7 x 10(4) to 9.7 x 10(7)/ml), salmonella typhimurium (8.0 x 10(6) to 1.1 x 10(7)/ml), streptococcus faecalis (5.0 x 10(7)/ml), staphylococcus aureus (8.1 x 10(7)/ml), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.2 x 10(5)/ml) under stirring in sterilized physiological saline at  37 degrees c, 99% of the viable cells of these bacteria were removed in 2 to 6 h. when suspensions of these bacteria (10(5) to 10(8) cells per ml) were passed through a column (20 mm by 100 cm) of cross-linked poly(n-benzyl-4-vinylpyridinium bromide) at 37 degrees c with a flow rate of 0.8  to 1.4 bed volumes per h, 97 to 100% of the viable cells were eliminated from the suspensions during the treatment. mechanistic studies demonstrated that cross-linked poly(vinylpyridinium halide) irreversibly captured these bacteria alive during the treatment. that is, total organic carbon was removed during the  treatment, and the bacteria which adhered to the resin proliferated on the bacterial medium. the adhesion capacity was estimated to be 10(10) cells per g (dry weight). total organic carbon was also removed even when the bacteria were killed by heat treatment before the column studies.

AB  == a novel approach for setting interpretive breakpoints in disk diffusion antibiotic susceptibility testing according to determined minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) limits is described, using the method of single-strain regression analysis. the procedure was tested on reference strains staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), streptococcus faecalis (atcc 29212), escherichia coli (atcc  25922), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853), using published results from cefoperazone disk diffusion experiments. the correlation between logarithm of the disk content and inhibition zone diameter squared was linear, excluding three endpoint values. when constants a and b in the new regression line equation were  calculated for the four strains, all four showed different regression lines. zone diameters corresponding to various mics were calculated for a disk content of 75  micrograms. the values obtained for the four strains were 20.1, 20.9, 24.9, and 25.8 mm, respectively, for an mic of 16 micrograms/ml, and 15.7, 15.7, 22.3, and  17.9 mm, respectively, for an mic of 64 micrograms/ml. the following zone diameter breakpoints were determined for the "i" (intermediate) category, using a 75-micrograms disk: s. aureus, 18 to 15 mm; s. faecalis, 23 to 13 mm; e. coli, 20 to 17 mm; and p. aeruginosa, 20 to 17 mm.

AB  == the growth-inhibiting behaviour of abacterial, liquid pure cultures made up of three water algae (hydrodictyon reticulatum, chlorella vulgaris, aphanothece nidulans) which were made to grow profusely in special culture containers under constant exposure to light and ventilation was examined in ten different species  of microorganisms during a period of contact of 4 days both in the light and in the dark. subjected to the test were the 5 pathogenic species staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium and  candida albicans as well the 5 bacterial contamination indicators e. coli (faecal indicator), streptococcus faecalis (enterococci), enterobacter aerogenes ("coliforms"), staphylococcus epidermidis (dermic germ) and bacillus subtilis ("contamination germ"). it was found that --hydrodictyon reticulatum and aphanothece nidulans exert a strong antibacterial effect, while chlorella vulgaris provides no indication of a bacterial growth-inhibiting effect. --this antibiosis is linked with the assimilative activity of the algal cultures, as in  the dark no antibacterial action is discernible --the "antibiotic principle" must be liable to transitory or rapid disintegration because the algal cultures are ineffective in the dark and also culture filtrates of 5-days old algal cultures exercise no growth-inhibiting effect. with respect to the sanitation of waters it is important to state that a profuse growth of algae produces a certain, but hardly reliable "biological water disinfection" and renders difficult the assessment of the quality of a water-course as a result of the elimination of the usual contamination indicators. therefore, additional microbiological quality parameters must be used for assessment of pollution of swimming pools with strong algal growth.

TI  == effects of physiologic variations in temperature on the rate of antibiotic-induced bacterial killing.
AB  == the effects of physiologic temperature variations on antibiotic-induced killing of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae were studied. at concentrations less than or equal to four times the minimal bactericidal concentration, the activity of each of the antibiotics (gentamicin sulfate, sodium ampicillin, and chloramphenicol) against  the test bacteria was influenced by changes in temperature. only with s. pneumoniae did such influence appear to result directly from temperature-induced  changes in the multiplication rate of the bacteria. repeated subculturing of bacteria at 41 degrees c to induce temperature adaptation had a variable effect on the rate of bacterial killing by appropriate antibiotics. the magnitude of the effect of temperature on antibiotic-induced rates of bacterial killing varies with the antibiotic class, the species of bacteria, and the temperature to which  bacteria have been adapted.

TI  == resistance of selected strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa to low-intensity ultraviolet radiation.
AB  == the resistances of 10 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and other microorganisms  to an ultraviolet (uv) intensity of 100 muw/cm2 were determined. organisms were exposed in 2- or 15-ml saline suspensions contained in uncapped polyethylene bottles for increasing periods of time, and the surviving fractions were enumerated. decimal reduction times were calculated by regression analysis, using the least-squares method. the 10 strains of p. aeruginosa, compared with micrococcus radiodurans and candida albicans, were very susceptible to low-intensity uv radiation. results from this study showed that a uv intensity of 100 muw/cm2 penetrated saline suspensions up to 40 mm deep sufficiently to kill high levels of microbial cells, especially p. aeruginosa cells. these results allowed us to design a system for determining and monitoring the sterilization capability of low-intensity uv radiation. in our particular case, uv proved to be an efficient mode for sterilizing saline suspensions of p. aeruginosa in polyethylene bottles. the significance and application of these findings with regard to supporting uv as a sterilant are discussed.

TI  == antibacterial properties of dilute formocresol and eugenol and propylene glycol.
AB  == formocresol and eugenol are the two nonspecific intracanal medicaments commonly used in endodontic practice. both have high tissue irritation potential when used in conventional strength. propylene glycol is an alcohol that is injectable and itself possesses significant antibacterial action. it is a popular vehicle and hence was used to modify the two drugs. standard bacteriologic methods were employed to test the antibacterial action of these lower concentrations of the two drugs against four test organisms. the investigations indicate that formocresol at as low as 10 to 20% and eugenol at 75% are bactericidal in action  and hence may be useful at these concentrations for clinical use. evaluation of these lower concentrations is warranted for possible clinical use. propylene glycol, which possesses antibacterial action and is remarkably innocuous to tissues, appears to be a suitable vehicle for dilution of formocresol and eugenol.

AB  == in continuance of our investigations from 1968 to 1972, we isolated 32939 microorganisms from urinary tract infections and subjected them to routine sensitivity tests against six antibiotics from 1973 to august 1975. all organisms except enterococci and proteus proved to be sensitive to gentamicin at a level exceeding 90% during the study period of two and a half years. a loss of activity of gentamicin worth mentioning was not detected during the studies. so this antibiotic must further be considered as one of the drugs of first choice in the  treatment of urinary tract infections.

TI  == alkyl streptozotocin analogues with improved biological activities.
AB  == alkyl 16alpha- and -beta-glycosides of a series of n3-alkyl homologues of streptozotocin were synthesized from glucosamine hydrochloride. these compounds,  when tested against ascites sarcoma 180, ehrlich ascites carcinoma, or leukemia l1210, exhibited potent antitumor activities, and antibacterial and diabetogenic  activities were eliminated. furthermore, the acute toxicities of these compounds  were lower than that of streptozotocin. the methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, and n-butyl  glycosides of streptozotocin, whether alpha- or beta-anomers, all showed higher antitumor activities than streptozotocin itself. the most active compound was found to be the methyl beta-streptozotocin.

TI  == survival of bacteria in seawater using a diffusion chamber apparatus in situ.
AB  == a microbiological survival chamber for in situ environmental studies involving microorganisms of public health significance was developed. the autoclavable chamber was provided with a supportive base for proper flow orientation and a battery-powered stirring mechanism for continuous internal agitation. the performance of the chamber and its ancillary units was evaluated in estuarine waters by diffusion studies and survival tests with eight species of bacteria isolated from environmental sources. polycarbonate filter membranes were found superior to cellulosic filter membranes. continuous mixing enhanced diffusion and ensured uniform cell suspension. salmonella enteritidis and klebsiella pneumoniae exhibited somewhat greater viability than escherichia coli under similar conditions. of three indicator organisms tested, streptococcus faecalis was the most persistent. in general, the data obtained indicate the usefulness of the chamber in measurements of microbial survival in the natural marine environment.

AB  == the effect of a standardized infection of pure and mixed cultures of gram-negative bacteria and a gram-positive coccus was studied in laparotomy wounds of rats. the infections were significantly stronger than in the control group wounds in 14 of 15 comparisons. this increased strength could not be correlated with an increased wound content of collagen. results of histologic studies showed a vigorous inflammatory response which probably was responsible for the increased strength. there was a suggestion in our data to support the concept that certain bacteria evoke the proper inflammatory response to result in stronger wounds, while others provoke too little or too much inflammation.

AB  == we studied on the antibacterial activity of gentamicin against various pathogens  isolated from clinical materials mainly isolated during 1974 and 1975, comparing  with other antibiotics. beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci  are less susceptible to gentamicin than staphylococci. staph, aureus and staph. epidermidis resistant to various antibiotics are very susceptible to gentamicin,  and no resistant strain to this drug was found. haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae and h. parahaemolyticus are very susceptible to gentamicin, and there is no resistant strain to this drug. escherichia coli, klebsiella, citrobacter, serratia and five species of proteus are more susceptible to gentamicin and tobramycin than dibekacin and amikacin. a few resistant or less susceptible strains to gentamicin are found in e. coli, citrobacerr, serratia, pr. morganii and pr. rettgeri. pr. inconstans is less susceptible to gentamicin than other species of proteus. antibacterial activity of gentamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa is very strong, but dibekacin and tobramycin are stronger. gentamicin-resistant strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa are now rather few.

AB  == a michael type addition of an amine to 6-methoxy-2-methyl-2-(4'-biphenylyl)-2h-pyran-3(6h)-one (1) dissolved in ether, benzene, or thf gave 5-amino derivatives of 5,6-dihydro-6-methoxy-2-methyl-2-(4'-biphenylyl)-2h-pyran-3(4h)-one (2). these by subsequent reduction with lialh4 were converted to 5-amino derivatives of 6-methoxy-2-methyl-2-(4'-biphenylyl)tetrahydro-2h-pyran-3-ol (3). both isomers a  and b of 1 (in regard to the methoxy group at c6) were used for the synthesis of  2 and 3. the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the amine adducts 2 was of the same order of magnitude as the starting material. amine adducts in general, however, were by far more active as coccidiostats than the starting material and  retained their activities when they were reduced. 5,6-dihydro-6-methoxy-2-methyl-2-(4'-biphenylyl)-5-(dimethylamino)-2h-pyran-3(4h) -one hydrochloride (a) and 5,6-dihydro-6-methoxy-2-methyl-2-(4'-biphenylyl)-5-(dimethylamino)-2h-pyran-3(4h) -one hydrochloride (b), prepared from isomer a and b of 1, respectively, were the most active as coccidiostats. these compounds when administered orally to chickens 1 day prior to infection at a concentration 0.05% in their diet gave them total protection against eimeria tenella.

TI  == [criteria for the evaluation of hygienic and microbiologic characteristics of mineral waters].
AB  == the appraisement of mineral waters microbial quality is closely depending of their definition: waters endowed with therapeutic properties, strongly mineralised waters, etc. in the beginning mineral water is exceptionally infected by dangerous germs tought it contain a regular load of some saprophytic microorganisms. indeed, exploitation licences are reserved to geologically perfectly protected strata. on the other hand, there are contaminations which are due, most commonly, to the bottling procedures: packings, work-rooms atmospheres, staff, etc. this being so, evaluation tests must be largely extended with regard  to those of feed water. we can distinguish between some bound to perfectly known  real risks and some referred to more hypothetical and more suggested dangers. the first ones protect from fecal contaminations (salmonella, coliforms, fecal streptococci, sulphite-reducing clostridium, fecal bacteriophages) and from cutaneous and mucous contaminations (pathogenic staphylococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa). they must be supervised with the most extreme severity. the second ones are concerned with saprophytic oligotrophic germs. at the present time, their incidence on public health cannot be discussed on serious foundations. it is the same for amoebae's presence which seems frequent in all kinds of waters. these problems must form the subject of thorough researchers.

AB  == a 1.5% glycine solution has recently been introduced as a bladder irrigation fluid. in this study, glycine solution was compared with two other recognised bladder irrigants (chlorhexidine and noxythiolin) for its inhibitory activity against common urinary tract pathogens. glycine solution supported the growth of  nearly 50% of the bacterial strains tested whereas chlorhexidine and noxythiolin  were completely inhibitory. in quantitative studies with selected strains it was  found that growth could be initiated from as few as 200 organisms/ml. it was concluded that glycine solution was capable of supporting bacterial growth and thus, from a microbiological viewpoint, was unsuitable as a bladder irrigant.

TI  == infection following total hip replacement in a general hospital without special orthopaedic facilities.
AB  == infection following total hip replacement is a serious complication for it is frequently impossible to resolve without removal of the prosthesis. we have reviewed 321 total hip replacements undertaken in a general hospital without special orthopaedic theatres. there were 17 deep infections, nine early and eight late. athough the diagnosis of early infection is usually not difficult, the differentiation between late infections, mechanical failure and metal sensitivity may be a problem. this paper discusses the use of esr, radiographs, isolation of  pathogenic organisms and bone scanning in reaching the diagnosis of infection of  the hip. there is possibly a parallel between prosthetic infection and subacute bacterial endocarditis. therefore all intercurrent infections and episodes of trauma should be given an adequate course of a broad spectrum antibiotic. sterile air and laminar flow systems are discussed and compared with prophylactic antibiotics, both systemic and local, in attempting to reduce the overall rate of infection following total replacement of the hip.

TI  == adherence of bacteria to heart valves in vitro.
AB  == the abilities of 14 strains of aerobic gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli to adhere in vitro to human or canine aortic valve leaflets were compared. 2-mm sections of excised valve leaflets were obtained by punch biopsy and were incubated under standardized conditions in suspensions of bacteria. valve sections were subsequently washed and homogenized, and quantitative techniques were used to determine the proportions of bacteria from the initial suspensions that had adhered to the valve sections. comparable results were obtained when these adherence ratios were determined by two independent methods based either on measurements of bacterial viability or of radioactivity in 51cr-labeled bacteria. for each bacterial strain, the adherence ratio was constant over a wide range of concentrations of bacteria in the incubation medium. strains of enterococci, viridans streptococci, coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa (adherence ratios 0.003-0.017) were found to adhere more readily to valve sections than strains of  escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae (adherence ratios 0.00002-0.00004). the organisms that most frequently cause bacterial endocarditis were found to adhere best to heart valves in vitro, suggesting that the ability to adhere to valvular endothelium may be an important or essential charcteristic of bacteria that cause endocarditis in man.

TI  == microstix-a reagent strip for urine culture.

TI  == indwelling catheter infection.
AB  == a "catheter team", consisting of two hospital assistants specially trained to catheterize male patients, inserted indwelling catheters in 435 men over a two-year period. the infection rate was 33%; in the 200 patients not treated with antimicrobial drugs (study group) the rate was 37%, while in the 235 patients who were so treated (antibacterial group) the infection rate was 29%. fifty percent of patients not treated were infected after 6.3 days, whereas in patients on antibacterial therapy a 50% infection rate was not reached until 14 days after insertion. therefore, no antibacterial therapy is necessary if it is anticipated  that the catheter will be necessary for less than four days. on the other hand, prophylactic antibacterial therapy would delay the onset of infection considerably if catheterization were expected to continue for more than four days. sulfisoxazole was our drug of choice for prophylactic treatment.

TI  == amoxycillin: a new semi-synthetic penicillin.
AB  == amoxycillin (alpha-amino-p-hydroxybenzylpenicillin) is a new semi-synthetic penicillin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity similar to that of ampicillin. penicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococci, streptococci, and pneumococci were sensitive to concentrations of 0.1 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. strains of haemophilus influenzae were inhibited by a level of 0.5 mug/ml, and most strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, shigella sonnei, salmonella species, and streptococcus faecalis were sensitive to a concentration of 5 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. penicillinase-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus and strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, indole-positive proteus, klebsiella, and enterobacter were insensitive to amoxycillin. the new penicillin was bactericidal in activity, as with other penicillins, and its antibacterial activity was not reduced in the presence of serum. after oral administration to volunteer subjects amoxycillin produced serum concentrations twice as high as those obtained with similar doses of ampicillin, and the penicillin was recovered unchanged in high concentrations in the urine. the absorption of amoxycillin was not greatly influenced by food, and administration  of probenecid resulted in increased and more prolonged concentrations of amoxycillin in serum.

TI  == media exchange method for demonstrating killing of l-phase variants in solid media by normal human serum.
AB  == normal human serum has been shown to kill l-phase variants in a fluid system by the action of antibody plus complement. previous studies, however, failed to demonstrate such killing in solid media. this failure probably resulted from inhibition of complement by medium components such as agar and nacl. a method was developed which circumvents the problems of the anticomplementary properties of agar media and the requirement of some l-phase variants for concentrations of salt that inhibit complement. using this method, we have demonstrated in solid media the killing by normal human serum of the l-phase variants of staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, s. faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhi. this method provides a relatively simple and graphic means for studying host humoral factors lethal for l-phase variants.

AB  == the effect of oral administration of antibiotics on the intestinal flora of conventional mice and their resistance to colonization by orally introduced escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa was studied. colonization resistance (cr) was expressed as the log of the oral bacterial dose  followed by a persistent take in 50% of the contaminated animals. the intestinal  flora was virtually eliminated by the antibiotics and this elimination was accompanied by a precipitous fall of cr. cr gradually returned to normal values during the period of repopulation of the intestinal tract by the organisms surviving the treatment. antibiotic treatment resulted in the disappearance of enterobacteriaceae, enterococci, staphylococci and yeasts and, under appropriate  housing conditions, the animals remained free of these organisms indefinitely. germ-free mice contaminated with the intestinal flora of an antibiotic-treated animal and their offspring housed in a germ-free isolator showed high values of cr. their intestinal flora consisted of anaerobic bacteria only. apparently, these anaerobes are responsible for cr in these and in conventional mice.

TI  == vitamin b12 uptake by intestinal microorganisms: mechanism and relevance to syndromes of intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
AB  == the mechanism of bacterial uptake of vitamin b(12), the spectrum of microorganisms capable of such uptake, and the factors involved were the subject  of this study. bacterial uptake of vitamin b(12) was found to be at least a two stage process. a primary uptake phase which was rapid (1 min or less), ph dependent, nontemperature dependent, did not require viable organisms and was insensitive to either the metabolic inhibitor dinitrophenol or to the sulfhydryl  inhibitor n-ethyl-maleimide. protein denaturation (formalin treatment or autoclaving) abolished all b(12) uptake. this primary uptake phase is thought to  represent adsorption to binding or "receptor" sites on the cell wall. second stage uptake was slower, ph and temperature dependent, required living bacteria,  and was abolished by either dinitrophenol or n-ethyl-maleimide. this phase is dependent upon metabolic processes and may reflect transfer of b(12) from surface "receptor" sites into the bacterial cell. although differences among organisms were observed in total 1 hr uptake, number of surface "receptor" sites, and relative avidities for b(12), all organisms except streptococcus fecalis shared the two stage mechanism. two gram-positive organisms. bacillus subtilis and group a streptococcus, demonstrated the highest 1 hr vitamin b(12) uptake values; gram-negative bacteria required 2,000-10,000 the number of organisms for comparable uptake. binding constants (k(m)) varied from 5.05 +/-1.67 x 10(-10)m for b. subtilis to 6.18 +/-3.08 x 10(-9)m for klebsiella pneumoniae which approximate the km for human intrinsic factor (0.38 x 10(-10)m). competition between bacteria and intrinsic factor for vitamin b(12) may be inferred from the  similarity of these constants. these observations suggest that a variety of enteric and nonenteric organisms, not requiring exogenous b(12), may play a role  in the pathogenesis of the vitamin b(12) malabsorption found in the intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndromes.

AB  == a series of penicillins characterized by the presence of a sulfoamino or a modified sulfoamino group in the side chain was subjected to in vitro antimicrobial screening tests. although the most potent members of the series were less active than benzylpenicillin against gram-positive bacteria and comparably active against most gram-negative bacteria, they were, on the average, 8 to 16 times more effective against strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. in other  comparative laboratory tests against p. aeruginosa, these compounds were about as active as carbenicillin and four to eight times more active than ampicillin. an examination of structure-activity relationships indicated that maximal potency was obtained with penicillins having an alpha-(aromatic or heteroaromatic)-alpha-sulfoaminoacetamido side chain. the compound with an alpha-phenyl group was comparable in activity to those having an alpha-(2- or 3-thienyl) group, whereas any modification in position or structure of the alpha-sulfoamino group reduced activity. results of studies with a cell-free p. aeruginosa beta-lactamase suggest that the marked inhibitory effects of alpha-sulfoamino penicillins for p. aeruginosa can be attributed, at least in part, to their high degree of resistance to this enzyme. some derivatives, however, had weak antipseudomonal activity, despite possessing a high degree of beta-lactamase resistance.

TI  == enhancing effect on alkalinization of the medium on the activity of erythromycin  against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of erythromycin was markedly enhanced by alkalinization of the culture medium or urine within the clinical range (ph 6.0 to 8.2). this effect was demonstrated against recent isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis. the urine of normal volunteers was made alkaline by ingestion of sodium bicarbonate or acetazolamide (diamox) during administration of 1.0 g of erythromycin every 8 hr; such urine was capable of inhibiting e. coli and k. pneumoniae even when diluted  up to (in one instance) 128 times with broth of the same ph as the urine. undiluted urine of the same subjects, without alkalinization, was seldom capable  of inhibiting these organisms. the range of ph (6.6 to 8.6) over which the antibacterial effect was enhanced coincided with that over which there was decreasing ionization of a basic group.

TI  == role of the phagocyte in host-parasite interactions. xii. hydrogen peroxide-myeloperoxidase bactericidal system in the phagocyte.
AB  == an antimicrobial system in polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn) consisting of myeloperoxidase and hydrogen peroxide has been proposed. this system appears to be activated during phagocytosis as a result of the stimulated metabolic activities. a lysed-granules (lg) fraction was prepared from guinea pig exudative pmn. lg alone possessed bactericidal activity which was related to the ph of the  reaction; the lower the ph, the more marked the activity. when low concentrations of both h(2)o(2) and lg were combined under conditions where neither factor alone exhibited significant killing power, there was a striking increase in bactericidal activity. this enhanced activity was much greater than an additive effect. the lg-peroxide antibacterial system was most active over a ph range of 4.0 to 6.0. the activity of the lg-peroxide system was essentially abolished by peroxidase inhibitors, nan(3), kcn, and aminotriazole. the antibacterial activity of this system was nonspecific in nature, being equally effective against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms.

TI  == gentamicin as a bactericidal agent in virological tissue cultures.
AB  == for use in virological tissue culture work, gentamicin is more convenient than penicillin + streptomycin. it is bactericidal for a wider range of organisms, may be used at only half the concentration needed for penicillin and streptomycin, does not apparently interfere with growth of tissue cultures and viruses, remains active at 37 degrees c., and, most remarkable of all, it is stable at autoclave temperatures and so can be put into media before sterilization, thus lessening the number of additions to the sterilized medium. gentamicin is now in routine use in this laboratory.
