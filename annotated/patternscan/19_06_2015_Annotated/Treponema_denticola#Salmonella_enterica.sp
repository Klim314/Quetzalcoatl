TI  == sodium ion cycle in bacterial pathogens: evidence from cross-genome comparisons.
AB  == analysis of the bacterial genome sequences shows that many human and animal pathogens encode primary membrane na+ pumps, na+-transporting dicarboxylate decarboxylases or na+ translocating nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, and a number  of na+ -dependent permeases. this indicates that these bacteria can utilize na+ as a coupling ion instead of or in addition to the h+ cycle. this capability to use a na+ cycle might be an important virulence factor for such pathogens as vibrio cholerae, neisseria meningitidis, salmonella enterica serovar typhi, and yersinia pestis. in treponema pallidum, chlamydia trachomatis, and chlamydia pneumoniae, the na+ gradient may well be the only energy source for secondary transport. a survey of preliminary genome sequences of porphyromonas gingivalis,  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and treponema denticola indicates that these oral pathogens also rely on the na+ cycle for at least part of their energy metabolism. the possible roles of the na+ cycling in the energy metabolism and pathogenicity of these organisms are reviewed. the recent discovery of an effective natural antibiotic, korormicin, targeted against the na+ -translocating nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, suggests a potential use of na+ pumps as drug targets and/or vaccine candidates. the antimicrobial potential of other inhibitors of the na+ cycle, such as monensin, li+ and ag+ ions, and amiloride derivatives, is discussed.

TI  == genetic and transcriptional analysis of flgb flagellar operon constituents in the oral spirochete treponema denticola and their heterologous expression in enteric  bacteria.
AB  == oral spirochetes possess many potential virulence factors, including the capacity for tissue invasion and persistence despite a vigorous host immune response. in an attempt to identify treponemal immunoreactive components, sera derived from individuals with advanced periodontal disease were used as a reagent to isolate recombinant bacteriophage lambda clones expressing antigens of the oral spirochete treponema denticola atcc 35405. nucleotide sequence analysis of a clone expressing three immunoreactive products has revealed seven t. denticola genes which appear to encode homologs of flagellar basal body constituents, flgb, flgc, flie, and flif, a flagellar switch component, flig, and the putative flagellar export proteins, flih and flii, initially characterized in salmonella typhimurium. also identified was a gene resembling flij. primer extension analysis identified a transcriptional start site 5' to the treponemal flgb gene.  appropriately spaced with respect to this start site was a sigma28 binding motif. the absence of additional identifiable sigma factor binding motifs within the treponemal sequence and the proximity of adjacent genes suggested operonic arrangement, and reverse transcriptase pcr provided evidence of cotranscription.  supporting the identification of these genes as flagellar components, heterologous expression in enteric bacteria of the putative switch basal body genes from t. denticola interfered with motility. specifically, the presence of a plasmid expressing treponemal flig reduced swarming motility in s. typhimurium, while in escherichia coli, this plasmid conferred a nonmotile phenotype and a reduction in flagellar number. thus, while spirochetal flagella are subject to unique synthetic and functional constraints, the organization of flagellar genes  and the presence of sigma28-like elements are reminiscent of the flagellar systems of other bacteria, and there appears to be sufficient conservation of constituent proteins to allow interaction between t. denticola switch-basal body  proteins and the flagellar machinery of gram-negative bacteria.
