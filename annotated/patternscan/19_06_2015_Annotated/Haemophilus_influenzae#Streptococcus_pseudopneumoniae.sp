TI  == molecular mapping to species level of the tonsillar crypt microbiota associated with health and recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  == the human palatine tonsils, which belong to the central antigen handling sites of the mucosal immune system, are frequently affected by acute and recurrent infections. this study compared the microbiota of the tonsillar crypts in children and adults affected by recurrent tonsillitis with that of healthy adults and children with tonsillar hyperplasia. an in-depth 16s rrna gene based pyrosequencing approach combined with a novel strategy that included phylogenetic analysis and detection of species-specific sequence signatures enabled identification of the major part of the microbiota to species level. a complex microbiota consisting of between 42 and 110 taxa was demonstrated in both children and adults. this included a core microbiome of 12 abundant genera found  in all samples regardless of age and health status. yet, haemophilus influenzae,  neisseria species, and streptococcus pneumoniae were almost exclusively detected  in children. in contrast, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae was present in all samples. obligate anaerobes like porphyromonas, prevotella, and fusobacterium were abundantly present in children, but the species diversity of porphyromonas and prevotella was larger in adults and included species that are considered putative pathogens in periodontal diseases, i.e. porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, and tannerella forsythia. unifrac analysis showed that recurrent tonsillitis is associated with a shift in the microbiota of the tonsillar crypts. fusobacterium necrophorum, streptococcus intermedius and prevotella melaninogenica/histicola were associated with recurrent tonsillitis in adults, whereas species traditionally associated with acute tonsillitis like pyogenic streptococci and staphylococcus aureus were scarce. the findings suggest that recurrent tonsillitis is a polymicrobial infection in which interactions within consortia of taxa play an etiologic role. the study contributes to the human microbiome data, to the understanding of the etiology of infections affecting the tonsils, and forms a basis for further insight into the consequences of the intense microbe-host interactions that take place in the tonsils.

TI  == streptococcus pseudopneumoniae: an emerging respiratory tract pathogen.
AB  == background & objectives: streptococcus pseudopneumoniae a member of the viridans  streptococci, is known to be associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and respiratory tract infections (rti). very scanty information is available on the isolation of s. pseudopneumoniae from india. hence, the present  study was an attempt to isolate s. pseudopneumoniae from clinical samples and to  study their drug resistance pattern. methods: sputum samples (n=150) submitted to the microbiology laboratory for routine culture from patients clinically suspected to have lower respiratory tract infection were inoculated onto sheep blood agar and chocolate agar plates. alpha haemolytic colonies were identified as s. pseudopneumoniae based on absence of capsule, bile solubility and optochin  susceptibility in 5 per cent co(2) and ambient air. disk diffusion method was used for antibiotic susceptibilily testing. results: among the samples screened,  4 per cent showed the growth of only s. pseudopneumoniae. other pathogens isolated were streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, klebsiella spp., enterococcus spp., pseudomonas spp., haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans. all the s. pseudopneumoniae isolates were resistant to  erythromycin. interpretation & conclusions: our preliminary results showed presence of s. pseudopneumoniae in this part of the country and these were associated with rti. currently, most clinical laboratories report optochin susceptible isolates in 5 per cent co(2) as s. pneumoniae and the resistant ones  are not further tested for susceptibility in ambient air. as a result, s. pseudopneumoniae may be missed out. hence, performance of at least two tests, viz. optochin susceptibility with incubation in 5 per cent co(2) and ambient air  along with bile solubility is necessary to differentiate s. pneumoniae from s. pseudopneumoniae.
