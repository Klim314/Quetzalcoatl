design, synthesis and biological evaluation of 4-benzoyl-1-dichlorobenzoylthiosemicarbazides as potent gram-positive antibacterial agents.
twelve 4-benzoyl-1-dichlorobenzoylthiosemicarbazides have been tested as potential antibacterials. all the compounds had mics between 0.49 and 15.63 microg/ml toward micrococcus luteus, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus epidermidis indicating, in most cases, equipotent or even more effective action than cefuroxime. in order to clarify if the observed antibacterial effects are universal, further research were undertaken to test inhibitory potency of two most potent compounds 3 and 11 on clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus. compound 11 inhibited the growth of methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa) at mics of 1.95-7.81 microg/ml, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) at mics of 0.49-1.95 microg/ml and mdr-mrsa at mic of 0.98 and 3.90 microg/ml, respectively. finally, inhibitory efficacy of 3 and 11 on planktonic cells and biofilms formation in clinical isolates of s. aureus and haemophilus parainfluenzae was tested. the majority of cells in biofilm populations of mssa and mrsa were eradicated at low level of 3, with mbics in the range of 7.82-15.63 microg/ml.
one-pot multi-component synthesis of 1,4-dihydropyridines using zn(2+) @ksf and evaluating their antibacterial and antioxidant activities.
new 5-aryl-10-(4-(4-methoxyphenyl)thiazole-2-yl)-9,10-dihydropyrido[2,3-d:5,6-d']dipy rimidinone-2,4,6,8-(1h,3h,5h,7h)-tetraones 6a-d were synthesized through one-pot four-component reaction of aldehydes, barbituric acid, and thiazole using zn(2+) @ksf under reflux condition. the key features of this reaction are: incorporating four heterocyclic rings, using a heterogeneous and efficient catalyst, high yield, and easy-to-setup reaction. the structure of the products was confirmed by ft-ir, (1)h nmr, and (13)c nmr spectra. the antibacterial activities of compounds 6a-d were screened against escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus bacterial strains using the zone inhibition method. also, the 2,2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (dpph) radical scavenging activities of compounds 6a-d were evaluated. all compounds showed good antioxidant capacity in comparison to ascorbic acid. the ic50 values of the antioxidant activity were calculated. the proposed mechanism for antioxidant activity is discussed.
structural modification of herboxidiene by substrate-flexible cytochrome p450 and glycosyltransferase.
herboxidiene is a natural product produced by streptomyces chromofuscus exhibiting herbicidal activity as well as antitumor properties. using different substrate-flexible cytochrome p450s and glycosyltransferase, different novel derivatives of herboxidiene were generated with structural modifications by hydroxylation or epoxidation or conjugation with a glucose moiety. moreover, two isomers of herboxidiene containing extra tetrahydrofuran or tetrahydropyran moiety in addition to the existing tetrahydropyran moiety were characterized. the hydroxylated products for both of these compounds were also isolated and characterized from s. chromofuscus pikc harboring pikc from the pikromycin gene cluster of streptomyces venezuelae and s. chromofuscus eryf harboring eryf from the erythromycin gene cluster of saccharopolyspora erythraea. the compounds generated were characterized by high-resolution quadrupole-time-of-flight electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (hr-qtof-esi/ms) and (1)h- and (13)c-nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) analyses. the evaluation of antibacterial activity against three gram-positive bacteria, micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis, and staphylococcus aureus, indicated that modification resulted in a transition from anticancer to antibacterial potency.
prenylated benzophenones from triadenum japonicum.
six new prenylated benzophenones, (-)-nemorosonol (1) and trijapins a-e (2-6), were isolated from the aerial parts of triadenum japonicum. (-)-nemorosonol (1) and trijapins a-c (2-4) have a common tricyclo[4.3.1.0(3,7)]decane skeleton, while 1 is an enantiomer of (+)-nemorosonol previously isolated from clusia nemorosa. the absolute configuration of (-)-nemorosonol (1) was assigned by ecd spectroscopy. trijapins a-c (2-4) are analogues of 1 possessing an additional tetrahydrofuran ring. trijapins d (5) and e (6) are prenylated benzophenones with a 1,2-dioxane moiety and a hydroperoxy group, respectively. (-)-nemorosonol (1) exhibited antimicrobial activity against escherichia coli (mic, 8 mug/ml), staphylococcus aureus (mic, 16 mug/ml), bacillus subtilis (mic, 16 mug/ml), micrococcus luteus (mic, 32 mug/ml), aspergillus niger (ic50, 16 mug/ml), trichophyton mentagrophytes (ic50, 8 mug/ml), and candida albicans (ic50, 32 mug/ml), while trijapin d (5) showed antimicrobial activity against c. albicans (ic50, 8 mug/ml).
antibacterial activity and genotypic-phenotypic characteristics of bacteriocin-producing bacillus subtilis kku213: potential as a probiotic strain.
the antimicrobial activity and probiotic properties of bacillus subtilis strain kku213, isolated from local soil, were investigated. the cell-free supernatant (cfs) of a kku213 culture containing crude bacteriocins exhibited inhibitory effects on gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus. the antibacterial activity of the cfs precipitated with 40% ammonium sulfate (as) remained even after treatment at 60 and 100 degrees c, at ph 4 and 10 and with proteolytic enzymes, detergents and heavy metals. when analyzed by sds-page and overlaid with the indicator strains b. cereus and s. aureus, the 40% as precipitate exhibited inhibitory activity on proteins smaller than 10 kda. however, proteins larger than 25 kda and smaller than 10 kda were still observed on a native protein gel. purified subtilosin a was prepared by amberlite xad-16 bead extraction and hplc and analyzed by nano-lc-qtof-ms. its molecular mass was found to be 3.4 kda, and it retained its antibacterial activity. these results are consistent with the detection of the anti-listerial subtilosin a gene of the sbo/alb cluster in the kku213 strain, which is 100% identical to that of b. subtilis subsp. subtilis 168. in addition to stable and cyclic subtilosin a, a mixture of many extracellular antibacterial peptides was also detected in the kku213 culture. the kku213 strain produced extracellular amylase, cellulase, lipase and protease, is highly acid-resistant (ph 2) when cultured in inulin and promotes health and reduces infection of intestinally colonized broiler chickens. therefore, we propose that bacteriocin-producing b. subtilis kku213 could be used as a potential probiotic strain or protective culture.
synthesis of novel benzimidazole functionalized chiral thioureas and evaluation of their antibacterial and anticancer activities.
a small library of benzimidazole functionalized chiral thioureas was prepared starting from natural amino acids (s)-alanine, (s)-phenylalanine, (s)-valine and (s)-leucine and also their (r)-isomers and studied their antimicrobial activity against a various gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. in this study, compounds 5g and 5j were found to exhibit good antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains such as staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, klebsiella planticola, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in the cytotoxicity study, thioureas derived from non-natural amino acids 5a-l showed good activity against human cancer cell lines a549, mcf7, du145, hela, and no cytotoxicity was observed with their antipodes 6a-l.
antibacterial potential of calotropis procera (flower) extract against various pathogens.
increased bacterial resistance towards commonly used antibiotics has become a debated issue all over the world in a last few decades. due to this, consumer demand towards natural anti-microbial agents is increasing day by day. natural anti-microbial agents have gained enormous attention as an alternative therapeutic agent in pharmaceutical industry. current study is an effort to explore and identify a bactericidal potential of various solvent extracts of calotropis procera flower. flowers of c. procera were extracted with hexane, butanol, ethyl acetate and aqua to evaluate the antibacterial activity by agar well diffusion method against the various human pathogens. the microorganisms used in this study includes salmonella typhi, escherichia coli (o157:h7), micrococcus luteus kibge-ib20 (gen bank accession: jq250612) and methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) kibge-ib23 (gen bank accession: kc465400). zones of inhibition were observed against all four pathogenic strains. fraction soluble in hexane showed broad spectrum of inhibition against all the studied pathogens. however, fractions soluble in ethyl acetate inhibited the growth of e. coli, mrsa, and m. luteus. in case of butanol and aqueous extracts only growth of m. luteus was inhibited. results revealed that the flower extracts of c. procera have a potential to be used as an antibacterial agent against these pathogenic organisms.
first total syntheses and antimicrobial evaluation of penicimonoterpene, a marine-derived monoterpenoid, and its various derivatives.
the first total synthesis of marine-derived penicimonoterpene (+/-)-1 has been achieved in four steps from 6-methylhept-5-en-2-one using a reformatsky reaction as the key step to construct the basic carbon skeleton. a total of 24 new derivatives of 1 have also been designed and synthesized. their structures were characterized by analysis of their 1h nmr, 13c nmr and hresims data. some of them showed significant antibacterial activity against aeromonas hydrophila, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, vibrio anguillarum, v. harveyi and/or v. parahaemolyticus, and some showed activity against plant-pathogenic fungi (alternaria brassicae, colletotrichum gloeosporioides and/or fusarium graminearum). some of the derivatives exhibited antimicrobial mic values ranging from 0.25 to 4 mug/ml, which were stronger than those of the positive control. notably, compounds 3b and 10 showed extremely high selectively against plant-pathogenic fungus f. graminearum (mic 0.25 mug/ml) and pathogenic bacteria e. coli (mic 1 mug/ml), implying their potential as antimicrobial agents. sar analysis of 1 and its derivatives indicated that modification of the carbon-carbon double bond at c-6/7, of groups on the allylic methylene unit and of the carbonyl group at c-1, effectively enhanced the antimicrobial activity.
amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptides: membrane active peptidomimetics and their potential as antimicrobial agents.
we introduce a novel class of membrane active peptidomimetics, the amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptides, and evaluate their potential as antimicrobial agents. the design criteria, the building block and oligomer synthesis as well as a detailed structure-activity relationship (sar) study are reported. specifically, infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (irras) was employed to investigate structural features of amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptide sequences at the hydrophobic/hydrophilic air/liquid interface. furthermore, langmuir monolayers of anionic and zwitterionic phospholipids have been used to model the interactions of amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptides with prokaryotic and eukaryotic cellular membranes in order to predict their membrane selectivity and elucidate their mechanism of action. lastly, antimicrobial activity was tested against gram-positive m. luteus and s. aureus as well as against gram-negative e. coli and p. aeruginosa bacteria along with testing hemolytic activity and cytotoxicity. we found that amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptide sequences combine high and selective antimicrobial activity with exceptionally low cytotoxicity in comparison to values reported in the literature. overall, this study provides further insights into the sar of antimicrobial peptides and peptidomimetics and indicates that amphiphilic cationic beta(3r3)-peptides are strong candidates for further development as antimicrobial agents with high therapeutic index.
evaluating the antimicrobial activity of methonolic extract of rhus succedanea leaf gall.
introduction: the worldwide increased bacterial resistance to antibiotics and the undesirable side effects associated with constant use of synthetic drugs has prompted the search for novel antimicrobial agents, particularly those manufactured from plants. this study is designed to ascertain the antibacterial potential of rhus succedanea leaf gall extracts on the growth of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. methods: the methanolic and hexane extract of different concentrations (100, 250, and 500 mug/ml) were prepared and their antibacterial efficacy was tested against clinical isolates of escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus using agar well diffusion method and the size of inhibition zone was measured in millimeters. results: the methanol and hexane extracts differed significantly in their antimicrobial activity with methanol extract showing a potent inhibitory activity in the range of 16+/-2 to 23+/-1, which was almost equal to the values of ciprofloxacin (25+/-3), used as a standard. further, the methanol extract was mostly potent and effective in inhibiting the growth of gram-negative bacteria, namely, e. coli, when compared to gram -positive bacteria stains, which are responsible for antimicrobial activities. the phytochemical screening showed positive results for the presence of steroids, triterpenes, alkaloids, and carbohydrates. conclusion: the potent antibacterial activity of rhus succedanea leaf gall extracts indicates its useful therapeutic application against bacterial infection. furthermore, this study indicates that the extract might be exploited as natural drug for the treatment of infectious diseases and could be useful in understanding the relations between traditional cures and current medications.
antimicrobial function of the gapdh-related antimicrobial peptide in the skin of  skipjack tuna, katsuwonus pelamis.
a 3.4 kda of antimicrobial peptide was purified from an acidified skin extract of skipjack tuna, katsuwonus pelamis, by preparative acid-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and c18 reversed-phase hplc. a comparison of the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified peptide with that of other known polypeptides revealed high sequence homology with the yfgap (yellowfin tuna glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-related antimicrobial peptide); thus, this peptide was identified as the skipjack tuna gapdh-related antimicrobial peptide (sjgap). sjgap showed potent antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria, such as bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus iniae (minimal effective concentrations [mecs], 1.2-17.0 mug/ml), gram-negative bacteria, such as aeromonas hydrophila, escherichia coli d31, and vibrio parahaemolyticus (mecs, 3.1-12.0 mug/ml), and against candida albicans (mec, 16.0 mug/ml) without significant hemolytic activity. antimicrobial activity of this peptide is heat-stable but salt-sensitive. according to the secondary structural prediction and the homology modeling, this peptide consists of three secondary structural motifs, including one alpha-helix and two parallel beta-strands, and forms an amphipathic structure. this peptide showed neither membrane permeabilization ability nor killing ability, but did display a small degree of leakage ability. these results suggest that sjgap acts through a bacteriostatic process rather than bactericidal one. sjgap is another gapdh-related antimicrobial peptide isolated from skipjack tuna and likely plays an important role for gapdh in the innate immune defense of tuna fish.

evaluation of antibacterial properties of barium zirconate titanate (bzt) nanoparticle.
so far, the antibacterial activity of some organic and inorganic compounds has been studied. barium zirconate titanate [ba(zrxti(1)-x)o(3)] (x = 0.05) nanoparticle is an example of inorganic materials. in vitro studies have provided evidence for the antibacterial activity of this nanoparticle. in the current study, the nano-powder was synthesized by sol-gel method. x-ray diffraction showed that the powder was single-phase and had a perovskite structure at the calcination temperature of 1000 degrees c. antibacterial activity of the desired nanoparticle was assessed on two gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus ptcc1431 and micrococcus luteus ptcc1625) and two gram-negative (escherichia coli hp101ba 7601c and clinically isolated klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria according to radial diffusion assay (rda). the results showed that the antibacterial activity of bzt nano-powder on both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was acceptable. the minimum inhibitory concentration of this nano-powder was determined. the results showed that mic values for e. coli, k. pneumoniae, m. luteus and s. aureus were about 2.3 mug/ml, 7.3 mug/ml, 3 mug/ml and 12 mug/ml, respectively. minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) was also evaluated and showed that the growth of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, m. luteus and s. aureus could be decreased at 2.3, 14, 3 and 18 mug/ml of bzt. average log reduction in viable bacteria count in time-kill assay ranged between 6 log(1)(0) cfu/ml to zero after 24 h of incubation with bzt nanoparticle.
mutational analysis of positively charged residues in the n-terminal region of the class iia bacteriocin pediocin pa-1.
the significance of positively charged residues for the target cell binding of pediocin pa-1 bacteriocins was studied by site-directed mutagenesis. most of the charged residues are located in the n-terminal half of the peptide, which is thought to mediate the initial binding of these bacteriocins to their target cells through electrostatic interactions. mutated peptides in which the positively charged residues were substituted or increased in number were constructed, and some of these peptides exhibited a twofold increase in the bacteriostatic activity. the greatest enhancement was achieved by introduced the positive charges at position 13, their results show the benefits of introducing an additional cationic residue within this patch in the middle of the n-terminal half of pediocin pa-1 bacteriocins. thus, the presence of additional cationic residues in the n-terminal half influenced the electrostatic binding of this bacteriocin to its target cells and increased the potency of the peptide on the potency of micrococcus luteus and staphylococcus aureus. significance and impact of the study: no previous work has systematically examined the n-terminal cationic residues of the pediocin pa-1 for their functional importance or redundancy. in this study, we examined the structure-function relationships of pediocin pa-1 by site-directed mutagenesis. mutated peptides in which the positively charged residues were substituted and increased in number exhibited a twofold increase in the bacteriostatic activity. this study demonstrated the importance of the cationic patch in the n-terminal half of pediocin pa-1. the cationic residues influenced the electrostatic binding of the bacteriocin to the target cells and had a greater effect on the potency of the peptide towards micrococcus luteus and staphylococcus aureus.
developing a microbiological growth inhibition screening assay for the detection  of 27 veterinary drugs from 13 different classes in animal feedingstuffs.
many regulations prohibit using veterinary drugs in feedingstuffs to protect consumers and animals alike. within this investigation we developed a simple, cost-efficient primary screening method for detecting antibiotics and coccidiostats in animal feeds. thirty-two veterinary drugs were originally considered. following matrix-free testing to optimise detection, an assay based on matrix extraction with methanol/acetonitrile/phosphate buffer followed by inoculation and diffusion in agar plates was developed. final validation was performed with 14 representative drugs (one per drug class) and four bacteria (escherichia coli atcc11303 and atcc27166, staphylococcus aureus atcc6538p, micrococcus luteus atcc9341) in bovine, lamb and swine fodder, measuring growth inhibition zones. of the original drugs tested, 27 remained detectable in feed matrices at or below 20 mg kg(-1). of the 14 validated representatives, two had estimated minimum detectable concentrations of 10-11 mg kg(-1), others of 5 mg kg(-1) or lower, an earlier minimum european union inclusion rate for many veterinary drugs. no significant matrix effect on inhibition zones was detected. per cent wrong negative deviations ranged from 0% (nine of 14 compounds) to 20-27% (two of 14), while inter-day precision based on inhibition zones had relative standard deviations (rsds) of 6-109% (mean of 40%). when setting a 1 mm inhibition zone, the maximum observed for negative controls, as a cut-off level, no false-positives were found. while not all targeted antibiotics were detectable in complex matrices, the majority of veterinary drugs were detected with reasonable sensitivity, indicating that this method could be suitable for screening feedingstuffs prior to further confirmatory investigation of positive findings such as by lc-ms/ms.
effective inhibition of bacterial respiration and growth by cuo microspheres composed of thin nanosheets.
this study describes the synthesis, characterization and biocidal potential of copper oxide micro-spheres composed of thin sheets (cuomss-ths). microscopic observations of synthesized cuomss-ths revealed the clusters of thin sheets arranged in small flower like micro-spheres. diameter of each micro-sphere was determined in the range of 2-3 mum, whereas the size of each sheet was approximately 80 nm. these micro-flowers like nanostructures were synthesized using copper nitrate hexahydrate and sodium hydroxide via solution process. the cuomss-ths exhibited a broad-spectrum anti-bacterial activity involving significant growth inhibition of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus. the ic50 values of these engineered nps against e. coli, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and m. luteus were determined to be 195, 200, 131 and 184 mug/ml, respectively. also, the respiration of gram+ ve organisms (m. luteus and s. aureus) was inhibited significantly (p value < 0.005) at relatively lower concentrations of 12.5 and 50 mug/ml, respectively, as compared to the gram- ve bacteria (e. coli and p. aeruginosa), where the growth inhibition occurred at a much greater concentration of 100 mug/ml. the results explicitly demonstrated anti-microbial activity of cuomss-ths with a higher level of toxicity against the gram+ ve vis-a-vis gram- ve bacteria.
sequences of metanicins, 20-residue peptaibols from the ascomycetous fungus cbs 597.80.
four linear 20-residue peptaibols, named metanicins (mtcs) a-d, were isolated from submerged cultures of the ascomycetous fungus cbs 597.80. structure elucidation was performed by a combination of fast-atom-bombardment mass spectrometry (fab-ms), electrospray ionization ms, edman degradation of isolated fragments, and amino acid analysis by ion-exchange and gas chromatography, and enantioselective hplc. the sequences of mtc a(b) are (amino acid exchange in b and c in parentheses): ac-aib-ala-aib-ala-aib-ala-gln-aib-val-aib-gly-leu-aib-pro-val-aib-aib(d-iva)-gln -gln-pheol and of mtc c(d) ac-aib-ala-aib-ala-aib-ala-gln-aib-val-aib-gly-leu-aib-pro-val-aib-aib(d-iva)-gln -gln-pheol (ac, acetyl; aib, alpha-aminoisobutyric acid; iva, isovaline; pheol, l-phenylalaninol). the peptides are related, and some of the sequences are identical, to other 20-residue peptaibols isolated from trichoderma species. mtcs show moderate activities against micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus, and very low activities against bacillus subtilis. the producer has originally been identified and deposited as metarhizium anisopliae var. anisopliae cbs 597.80. although this identification has been withdrawn by centralbureau voor schimmelcultures (cbs) in the meantime, the accession number will be retained - independently from any taxonomic revisions.
co-production of surfactin and a novel bacteriocin by bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis h4 isolated from bikalga, an african alkaline hibiscus sabdariffa seed fermented condiment.
bikalga is a hibiscus sabdariffa seed fermented condiment widely consumed in burkina faso and neighboring countries. the fermentation is dominated by bacillus subtilis group species. ten b. subtilis subsp. subtilis (six isolates) and bacillus licheniformis (four isolates) isolated from traditional bikalga were examined for their antimicrobial activity against a panel of 36 indicator organisms including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and yeasts. the bacillus spp. isolates showed variable inhibitory abilities depending on the method used. both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were inhibited in the agar spot assay while only gram-positive pathogens were inhibited in the agar well diffusion assay. cell free supernatants (cfs) of pure cultures of 3 b. subtilis subsp. subtilis (g2, h4 and f1) strains inhibited growth of listeria monocytogenes, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus, while cfs of 2 b. licheniformis (e3 and f9) strains only inhibited m. luteus. the antimicrobial substance(s) produced by b. subtilis subsp. subtilis h4 was further characterized. the antimicrobial substance(s) produced by h4 was detected from mid-exponential growth phase. the activity was sensitive to protease and trypsin, but resistant to the proteolytic action of proteinase k and papain. treatment with alpha-amylase and lipase ii resulted in a complete loss of antimicrobial effect, indicating that a sugar moiety and lipid moiety are necessary for the activity. treatment with mercapto-ethanol resulted in a significant loss, indicative of the presence of disulfide bridges. the antimicrobial activity of h4 was heat resistant and active at ph3-10. pcr detection of yiwb, sboa, spox, alba and spas, etns genes and genes coding for surfactins and plipastatins (fengycins) indicated a potential for subtilosin, subtilin and lipopeptide production, respectively. sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) was carried out and a single band of approximately 4kda had antimicrobial activity. ultra high performance liquid chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (uhplc-tofms) analysis of the 4kda band allowed identification of surfactin and a protein with a monoisotopic mass of 3346.59da, which is dissimilar in size to subtilosin and subtilin. surfactin is a cyclic lipoheptapeptide, which contains a beta-hydroxy fatty acid, but no di-sulfide bridges or sugar residues. the complete loss of activity upon amylase treatment indicates that surfactin was not responsible for the observed antimicrobial effect. however, it cannot completely be ruled out that surfactin acts synergistically with the detected protein, though further investigations are needed to confirm this.
isolation, biochemical characterization, and cloning of a bacteriocin from the poultry-associated staphylococcus aureus strain ch-91.
staphylococcus aureus strain ch-91, isolated from a broiler chicken with atopic dermatitis, has a highly proteolytic phenotype that is correlated with the disease. we describe the isolation and biochemical and molecular characterization of the ai-type lantibiotic bacch91 from s. aureus ch-91 culture medium. the bacteriocin was purified using a three-stage procedure comprising precipitation with ammonium sulfate, extraction with organic solvents, and reversed-phase hplc. the bacch91 peptide is thermostable and highly resistant to cleavage by both prokaryotic and eukaryotic peptidases. the mic for the gram-positive bacteria ranged from 2.5 nm for microococcus luteus through 1.3-6.0 mum for staphylococcal strains up to more than 100 mum for lactococcus lactis. bacch91 was ineffective against the gram-negative strains tested at the maximal concentration (100 mum). the amino acid sequence of bacch91 is similar to that of epidermin and gallidermin. the encoding gene (bacch91) occurred in two allelic variants distinguishable in the restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. variant i, identified in s. aureus ch-91, dominated in s. aureus strains of poultry origin, although strains with variant ii were also identified in this group. s. aureus strains of human origin were characterized exclusively by variant ii.
crustins from eyestalk cdna library of swimming crab portunus trituberculatus: molecular characterization, genomic organization and expression analysis.
crustins are cationic, cysteine-rich antimicrobial proteins, containing a single  whey acidic protein (wap) domain in the c-terminal end. different from the reported ptcrustin in the hemocytes, two novel crustin genes (ptcrustin2 and ptcrustin3) were cloned completely from the eyestalk cdna library of portunus trituberculatus in this study. all ptcrustins share the consensus cysteine motif and are considered as type i crustins. four exons and three introns are identified in genomic dna sequence of ptcrustin3 while three exons and two introns in ptcrustin2. the mrna transcripts of ptcrustin2 and ptcrustin3 are mainly detected in eyestalk and gills, but not in hemocytes. although both ptcrutins are up-regulated after challenge of three microorganisms, ptcrustin3 seems to respond more quickly to microbial challenge than ptcrustin2. unlike most crustins, both recombinant ptcrustin2 and ptcrustin3 exhibit antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria micrococcus luteus and staphyloccocus aureus and gram-negative bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa. in addition, rptcrustin2 is moderately active against yeast pichia pastoris and rptcrustin3 show significant activity against gram-negative bacterium vibrio alginolyticus. these results indicate that ptcrustin2 and ptcrustin3 are two novel crustins and play different roles in immune response of p. trituberculatus against microbial challenge.
biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using latex from few euphorbian plants and their antimicrobial potential.
the synthesis of well-dispersed and ultrafine metal nanoparticles has great interest due to their distinctive physicochemical properties and biomedical applications. this study is the first report of one-step solvent-free synthesis of agnps using euphorbiaceae plant latex. among evaluated eight latex-producing plants, four (jatropha curcas, jatropha gossypifolia, pedilanthus tithymaloides, and euphorbia milii) showed high potential to produce physicochemically distinct, small-sized and bactericidal agnps. phytochemical screening showed presence of rich amount of biochemicals in these plants. j. gossypifolia showed uniformly dispersed comparatively small-sized agnps. dose-dependent growth inhibition of bacterial pathogens escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermis, and micrococcus luteus was observed for j. gossypifolia latex-synthesized agnps with minimum inhibitory concentration values 30, 40, 70, 60, and 60 ppm, respectively, after 24 h. possible mode of action of agnps against pathogens was confirmed by analyzing enzymes and cell leakage.

novel 1,1'-(5,5'-(1,4-phenylene)bis(3-aryl-1h-pyrazole-5,1-(4h,5h)-diyl))diethanones 7-12 were tested for their antimicrobial activity by disc diffusion and twofold serial dilution method against the tested bacterial and fungal strains. compounds 7 against micrococcus luteus, 8 against beta-heamolytic streptococcus, m. luteus, klebsiella pneumonia, microsporum gypseum, 9 against staphylococcus aureus, shigella flexneri, vibreo cholerae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aspergillus flavus, mucor indicus, 10 against salmonella typhii, s. flexneri, m. gypseum, 11 against k. pneumonia, m. gypseum, 12 against k. pneumonia, and m. gypseum show superior zone of inhibitions and exhibited excellent antibacterial and antifungal activities at a mic value of 6.25 mug/ml. moreover, all the tested compounds 7-12 revealed promising antitubercular activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv and inh-resistant m. tuberculosis. compounds 8 against m. tuberculosis and 11 against inh-resistant m. tuberculosis exhibited the percentage of reduction in rlu at 89 and 85%, respectively.
in vitro interaction of chronic wound bacteria in biofilms.
objective: to use in vitro biofilm models of wound bacterial isolates and compare the biofilms produced for different combinations of wound bacterial species. method: in vitro biofilms, generated by pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus oralis and micrococcus luteus in microtitre plates and a constant depth film fermentor (cdff), were studied. the tested isolates all originated from chronic venous leg ulcers. biofilms of individual and dual combinations of these species were generated in microtitre plate wells at 37 degrees c for 24-96 hours and also in the cdff for 7 days. the extent of biofilm formation from these systems was then measured using crystal violet staining and/or total viable counts. results: all the chronic wound bacteria formed biofilms (both individually and in mixed culture) in these models. in mixed species microtitre plate biofilms, both p. aeruginosa and s. aureus appeared to antagonise biofilm formation by s. oralis and m. luteus, with p. aeruginosa completely inhibiting the growth of these organisms. similar effects were evident in the cdff model, when all four bacterial species were added simultaneously, with m. luteus being 'out-competed' by the other organisms present and occurring at numbers at the limits of detection; however, there was an apparent increase in the numbers of s. oralis compared with its single culture equivalent. conclusion: the study highlighted differences in biofilm formation ability for the tested species in both closed and open model systems. using dual species biofilms, distinct species antagonism was observed with apparent antagonism of pathogenic species over 'commensal' ones. such a finding provides insight into possible bacterial interactions during development of 'non-healing' wound biofilms.
n-o chemistry for antibiotics: discovery of n-alkyl-n-(pyridin-2-yl)hydroxylamine scaffolds as selective antibacterial agents using nitroso diels-alder and ene chemistry.
the discovery, syntheses, and structure-activity relationships (sar) of a new family of heterocyclic antibacterial compounds based on n-alkyl-n-(pyridin-2-yl)hydroxylamine scaffolds are described. a structurally diverse library of approximately 100 heterocyclic molecules generated from lewis acid-mediated nucleophilic ring-opening reactions with nitroso diels-alder cycloadducts and nitroso ene reactions with substituted alkenes was evaluated in whole cell antibacterial assays. compounds containing the n-alkyl-n-(pyridin-2-yl)hydroxylamine structure demonstrated selective and potent antibacterial activity against the gram-positive bacterium micrococcus luteus atcc 10240 (mic(90) = 2.0 mum or 0.41 mug/ml) and moderate activity against other gram-positive strains including antibiotic resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococcus faecalis (vre). a new synthetic route to the active core was developed using palladium-catalyzed buchwald-hartwig amination reactions of n-alkyl-o-(4-methoxybenzyl)hydroxylamines with 2-halo-pyridines that facilitated sar studies and revealed the simplest active structural fragment. this work shows the value of using a combination of diversity-oriented synthesis (dos) and parallel synthesis for identifying new antibacterial scaffolds.
phytochemical analysis and antimicrobial activities of methanolic extracts of leaf, stem and root from different varieties of labisa pumila benth.
a local herb, kacip fatimah, is famous amongst malay women for its uses in parturition; however, its phytochemical contents have not been fully documented. therefore, a study was performed to evaluate the phenolics, flavonoids, and total saponin contents, and antibacterial and antifungal properties of the leaf, stem and root of three varieties of labisia pumila benth. total saponins were found to be higher in the leaves of all three varieties, compared to the roots and stems. leaves of var. pumila exhibited significantly higher total saponin content than var. alata and lanceolata, with values of 56.4, 43.6 and 42.3 mg diosgenin equivalent/g dry weight, respectively. hplc analyses of phenolics and flavonoids in all three varieties revealed the presence of gallic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, and myricetin in all plant parts. higher levels of flavonoids (rutin, quercitin, kaempferol) were observed in var. pumila compared with alata and lanceolata, whereas higher accumulation of phenolics (gallic acid, pyrogallol) was recorded in var. alata, followed by pumila and lanceolata. antibacterial activities of leaf, stem and root extracts of all varieties determined against both gram positive (micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis b145, bacillus cereus b43, staphylococcus aureus s1431) and gram negative (enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumonia k36, escherichia coli e256, pseudomonas aeruginosa pi96) pathogens showed that crude methanolic extracts are active against these bacteria at low concentrations, albeit with lower antibacterial activity compared to kanamycin used as the control. antifungal activity of methanolic extracts of all plant parts against fusarium sp., candida sp. and mucor using the agar diffusion disc exhibited moderate to appreciable antifungal activities compared to streptomycin used as positive control.
synthesis and in vitro microbiological evaluation of novel diethyl 6,6'-(1,4-phenylene)bis(4-aryl-2-oxo-cyclohex-3-enecarboxylates).
novel bis cyclohexenone ester derivatives 14-19 were synthesized and characterized by their spectral data. in vitro microbiological evaluations were carried out for all the novel compounds 14-19 against clinically isolated bacterial and fungal strains. compounds 15, 16, 18 against staphylococcus aureus, 14, 15 against beta-haemolytic streptococcus, 15, 19 against micrococcus luteus, 17, 18 against salmonella typhii, 14, 17 against shigella flexneri, 15 against escherichia coli, 16 against pseudomonas aeruginosa, 15, 18, 19 against klebsiella pneumonia exhibited potent antibacterial activity at an minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 6.25 mug/ml, whereas compound 16 against aspergillus flavus, 17 against a. niger, 16, 18 against mucor indicus, 15, 17-19 against microsporum gypseum revealed excellent antifungal activity at an mic value of 6.25 mug/ml.
relative roles of the cellular and humoral responses in the drosophila host defense against three gram-positive bacterial infections.
background: two nf-kappab signaling pathways, toll and immune deficiency (imd), are required for survival to bacterial infections in drosophila. in response to septic injury, these pathways mediate rapid transcriptional activation of distinct sets of effector molecules, including antimicrobial peptides, which are important components of a humoral defense response. however, it is less clear to what extent macrophage-like hemocytes contribute to host defense. methodology/principal findings: in order to dissect the relative importance of humoral and cellular defenses after septic injury with three different gram-positive bacteria (micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus), we used latex bead pre-injection to ablate macrophage function in flies wildtype or mutant for various toll and imd pathway components. we found that in all three infection models a compromised phagocytic system impaired fly survival--independently of concomitant toll or imd pathway activation. our data failed to confirm a role of the pgrp-sa and gnbp1 pattern recognition receptors for phagocytosis of s. aureus. the drosophila scavenger receptor eater mediates the phagocytosis by hemocytes or s2 cells of e. faecalis and s. aureus, but not of m. luteus. in the case of m. luteus and e. faecalis, but not s. aureus, decreased survival due to defective phagocytosis could be compensated for by genetically enhancing the humoral immune response. conclusions/significance: our results underscore the fundamental importance of both cellular and humoral mechanisms in drosophila immunity and shed light on the balance between these two arms of host defense depending on the invading pathogen.
identification of streptomyces sp. kh29, which produces an antibiotic substance processing an inhibitory activity against multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii.
the actinomycete strain kh29 is antagonistic to the multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. based on the diaminopimelic acid (dap) type, and the morphological and physiological characteristics observed through the use of scanning electron microscopy (sem), kh29 was confirmed as belonging to the genus streptomyces. by way of its noted 16s rdna nucleotide sequences, kh29 was found to have a relationship with streptomyces cinnamonensis. the production of an antibiotic from this strain was found to be most favorable when cultured with glucose, polypeptone, and yeast extract (py) medium for 6 days at 27 degrees c. the antibiotic produced was identified, through comparisons with reported spectral data including ms and nmr as a cyclo(l-tryptophanyl-l-tryptophanyl). cyclo(l-trp-l-trp), from the py cultures of kh29, was seen to be highly effective against 41 of 49 multidrugresistant acinetobacter baumannii. furthermore, cyclo(ltrp- l-trp) had antimicrobial activity against bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, saccharomyces cerevisiae, aspergillus niger, and candida albicans, however, it was ineffective against streptomyces murinus.
effect of flash-heat treatment on antimicrobial activity of breastmilk.
background and objectives: the world health organization recommends human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-positive mothers in resource-poor regions heat-treat expressed breastmilk during periods of increased maternal-to-child transmission risk. flash-heat, a "low tech" pasteurization method, inactivates hiv, but effects on milk protein bioactivity are unknown. the objectives were to measure flash-heat's effect on antimicrobial properties of lactoferrin, lysozyme, and whole milk and on the digestive resistance of lactoferrin and lysozyme. methods: flash-heated and unheated breastmilk aliquots from hiv-positive mothers in south africa were "spiked" with staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli and then cultured for 0, 3, and 6 hours. lysozyme and lactoferrin activities were determined by lysis of micrococcus luteus cells and inhibition of enteropathogenic e. coli, respectively, measured spectrophotometrically. percentages of proteins surviving in vitro digestion, lactoferrin and lysozyme activity, and bacteriostatic activity of whole milk in heated versus unheated samples were compared. results: there was no difference in rate of growth of e. coli or s. aureus in flash-heated versus unheated whole milk (p = 0.61 and p = 0.96, respectively). mean (95% confidence interval) antibacterial activity of lactoferrin was diminished 11.1% (7.8%, 14.3%) and that of lysozyme by up to 56.6% (47.1%, 64.5%) by flash-heat. digestion of lysozyme was unaffected (p = 0.12), but 25.4% less lactoferrin survived digestion (p < 0.0001). conclusions: in summary, flash-heat resulted in minimally decreased lactoferrin and moderately decreased lysozyme bioactivity, but bacteriostatic activity of whole milk against representative bacteria was unaffected. this suggests flash-heated breastmilk likely has a similar profile of resistance to bacterial contamination as that of unheated milk. clinical significance of the decreased bioactivity should be tested in clinical trials.
chemical composition and antibacterial activity of essential oils of lantana camara, ageratum houstonianum and eupatorium adenophorum.
essential oils have applications in folk medicine, food preservation, and as feed additives. the essential oils of lantana camara linn. (verbenaceae), ageratum houstonianum mill. (asteraceae) and eupatorium adenophorum spreng. (asteraceae) were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gcms). in l. camara oil, of the total identified (83.91%) volatile constituents, five constituents [3,7,11-trimethyl-1,6,10-dodecatriene (28.86%), beta-caryophyllene (12.28%), zingiberene (7.63%), gamma-curcumene (7.50%) and alpha-humulene (3.99%)] represented the major ones. in a. houstonianum oil, among the total identified volatile constituents (94.51%), three [precocene-ii (52.64%), precocene-i (22.45%) and beta-caryophyllene (9.66%)] represented the major ones. in e. adenophorum oil, of the total identified volatile constituents (84.95%), six [1-napthalenol (17.50%), alpha-bisabolol (9.53%), bornyl acetate (8.98%), beta-bisabolene (6.16%), germacrene-d (5.74%) and alpha- phellandrene (3.85%)] represented the major ones. the antibacterial activity expressed as minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) (microg/ml) was determined by the broth dilution method. the essential oil of e. adenophorum had antibacterial activity against arthrobacter protophormiae, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, rhodococcus rhodochrous, and staphylococcus aureus with mbc values of 200, 100, 100, 12.5, and 200, respectively. the essential oil of a. houstonianum showed antibacterial activity against m. luteus and r. rhodochrous with mbc of 100 and 12.5, but not against a. protophormiae, e. coli, and s. aureus. the essential oil of l. camara showed antibacterial activity against a. protophormiae, m. luteus, r. rhodochrous and s. aureus with mbc of 50, 25, 12.5, and 200, respectively, but not against e. coli. mbc was lowest for r. rhodochrous for all the three essential oils.
aureocins 4185, bacteriocins produced by staphylococcus aureus 4185: potential application in food preservation.
in the present study, the bacteriocins produced by staphylococcus aureus 4185, a  strain isolated from bovine mastitis, were purified and partially characterized. after purification by ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange chromatography, and five runs of high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc), antimicrobial activity was recovered with 40% and 80% isopropanol, suggesting that more than one antimicrobial peptide, named aureocins 4185, is produced by s. aureus 4185. mass spectrometry analyses revealed three peptides eluted with 40% isopropanol: peptide a (2,305.3 +/-1.5 da), peptide b (2,327.3 +/-1.5 da), and peptide c (3,005.5 +/-1.5 da), and two peptides eluted with 80% isopropanol: peptide d (6,413.5 +/-1.5 da) and peptide e (12,834.5 +/-1.5 da). although five peptides have been detected, only four small peptide sequences were obtained by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (maldi-tof)/tof mass spectrometry analyses: slleqftgk (eluted with 40% isopropanol), allyder, nntshnlplgwfnvk, and nnlaqgtfnatk (eluted with 80% isopropanol). the sequences slleqftgk and allyder revealed identity with hypothetical peptides with unknown function. the sequences nntshnlplgwfnvk and nnlaqgtfnatk showed similarity to a segment of a precursor of staphylococcal autolysins. the antimicrobial activity detected in the supernatant of strain 4185 proved to be resistant to heat treatment at 65 degrees c; however, treatment at 80 degrees c abolished completely its antimicrobial properties. the concentrated supernatant containing aureocins 4185 exhibited a strong bacteriolytic activity toward micrococcus luteus atcc 4698. additionally, aureocins 4185 exhibited antagonistic activity against important foodborne pathogens, including listeria monocytogenes, thus showing a potential application in food preservation.
linum usitatissimum (linseed/flaxseed) fixed oil: antimicrobial activity and efficacy in bovine mastitis.
purpose: in vitro antimicrobial activity and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of l. usitatissimum (linseed/flaxseed) fixed oil in bovine mastitis were investigated. method: in vitro antimicrobial activity of l. usitatissimum fixed oil was evaluated against a number of microorganisms by disc diffusion method and mic determination. the in vivo efficacy of the oil was evaluated in nine mastitis-affected cows divided into three groups (three in each group), following once-a-day intramammary infusion of oil, cefoperazone or an oil-cefoperazone combination for 7 days and by monitoring the california mastitis test score, somatic cell count and microbial count in milk samples. results: the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the oil against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae and escherichia coli was comparable to that of cefoperazone while the antimicrobial activity against enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus and candida albicans, was greater than that of cefoperazone. in the in vivo study, the oil exhibited significant reduction in the california mastitis test score and somatic cell count in milk samples from infected udders following 7 days of intramammary administration suggesting its anti-inflammatory effect. the microbial count in milk samples was also reduced significantly following oil treatment. the effects were comparable to the treatment by cefoperazone (mastiwock) alone or in combination with the oil. apparently, the anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of the oil contribute to its therapeutic efficacy in mastitis; the oil could be used as an alternative treatment for bovine mastitis conclusion: the results suggest possible therapeutic potential of l. usitatissimum fixed oil in bovine mastitis.
essential oil from the underground parts of laserpitium zernyi: potential source  of alpha-bisabolol and its antimicrobial activity.
the composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil from the underground parts (roots and rhizomes) of laserpitium zernyi hayek (apiaceae) were investigated. the pale blue essential oil, obtained by hydrodistillation, was analyzed by gc and gc-ms. forty-three compounds were identified (94.3% of total oil). the main constituent, beside alpha-pinene (31.6%) was alpha-bisabolol (30.9%), so this oil may be a novel potential natural source of this sesquiterpene alcohol. the antimicrobial activity was tested using the microdilution method against gram (+) bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis), gram (-) bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli), and two strains of yeast (candida albicans). l. zernyi oil showed significant antibacterial activity against s. epidermidis, s. aureus and m. luteus, but lower activities against the other tested strains.
antibacterial activities of dodonaea viscosa using contact bioautography technique.
the crude ethanolic extract and n-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, n-butanol and aqueous fractions of dodonaea viscosa were analyzed for antibacterial potential against four gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, and three gram negative bacteria: escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa. preliminary screening showed inhibition against staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the thin layer chromatograms of the fractions were then subjected to contact bioautography, which showed inhibition zone at different r(f) values against bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi and pseudomonas aeruginosa, indicating the presence of antibacterial components. the mic of each fraction was determined through a 96-well micro-titer plate method. the non-viability of the organisms was ascertained by determining the mbc of the fractions.
antibacterial activity of dextran-conjugated lysozyme against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus in cheese curd.
the purposes of this research were to glycosylate lysozyme with dextran under maillard reaction conditions and assess the antimicrobial characteristics of the lysozyme-dextran conjugate in a culture medium and cheese curd. solutions containing lysozyme and dextran were incubated at 60 degrees c and at 79% relative humidity. gel permeation chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were used to follow the glycosylation process. under optimum conditions 3.7 mol of dextran were coupled to 1 mol of lysozyme. lytic activity of the conjugate against the cell wall of micrococcus luteus was about 62% of that of native lysozyme. evaluation of the lysozyme-dextran conjugate against test microorganisms (staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli) in culture media indicated a progressive increase in antimicrobial activity, with an increase in enzyme-conjugate concentration. the lysozyme-dextran conjugate was also effective against e. coli in a natural food system, as it reduced the bacterial count by 3 log in cheese curd after 40 days of storage. unlike e. coli, the antimicrobial action of lysozyme against s. aureus was not improved by conjugation with dextran in both in vitro and in vivo tests. antimicrobial activity of the lysozyme-dextran conjugate against gram-negative bacteria is probably related to the remaining lytic activity as well as the excellent surfactant properties of the lysozyme-dextran conjugate. these results might increase the applicability of lysozyme as a natural antimicrobial ingredient in different food products.
broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of the reactive compounds generated in vitro by manduca sexta phenoloxidase.
although quinone production and melanin formation are widely recognized as an integral part of the insect defense system, experimental evidence is lacking that the proteolytic activation of prophenoloxidase participates in the direct killing of invading microbes-active phenoloxidase generates quinones that polymerize to form melanin. here, we report the antimicrobial effect of reactive intermediates produced in phenoloxidase-catalyzed reactions. after being treated with manduca sexta phenoloxidase and dopamine, escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis ceased to grow, whereas the growth of pichia pastoris was slightly affected. microscopic analysis showed melanin deposition on cell surface, aggregation of bacteria, and loss of cell mobility. viability tests revealed major decreases in the bacterial colony counts and, since the decrease remained significant after dispersion of the cell clumps, the reactive compounds were surmised to have aggregated and killed e. coli and b. subtilis cells. under the experimental conditions, 60-94% of the gram-negative bacteria (e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium) and 52-99% of the gram-positive bacteria (bacillus cereus, b. subtilis, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus) were killed. in the presence of phenoloxidase, dopamine or 5,6-dihydroxyindole (dhi) exhibited much higher antibacterial activity than l-dopa, n-acetyldopamine (nada) or n-beta-alanyldopamine (nbad) did, suggesting that dhi and its oxidation products were cytotoxic. the antifungal activity of dhi was detected using p. pastoris, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida albicans, and beauveria bassiana. these results established that prophenoloxidase activation is an integral component of the insect defense system involving a multitude of enzymes (e.g. proteinases, oxidases, and dopachrome conversion enzyme (dce)), which immobilizes and kills invading microorganisms.

antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-cholinesterase and mutagenic effects of extracts obtained from some trees used in south african traditional medicine.
extracts obtained from 10 trees used in south african traditional medicine were screened for antibacterial, anti-inflammatory (cox-1 and cox-2) and anti-cholinesterase activities and investigated for potential mutagenic effects using the ames test. antibacterial activity was detected using the disc-diffusion and micro-dilution assays. the extracts were tested against gram-positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus and gram-negative bacteria: escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. of the 78 different plant extracts investigated, 80% showed activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in the disc-diffusion assay. in the micro-dilution assay, 60% of the plant extracts showed minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values < or =1.56 mg ml(-1). the lowest mic value (0.092 mg ml(-1)) was recorded for an ethyl acetate root extract of acacia sieberiana against staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. in the anti-inflammatory assay, 70% of the investigated plant extracts (0.25 mg ml(-1)) inhibited both cox-1 and cox-2 activity (>50% and 70% for water and organic solvent extracts, respectively). an ethyl acetate leaf extract of trichilia dregeana showed selective inhibition of cox-2 (81%). in the acetylcholinesterase inhibitory test, 21% of the plant extracts were active at a concentration < or =1 mg ml(-1) using the micro-dilution assay. the lowest ic(50) value was 0.04 mg ml(-1) obtained with an ethanol bark extract of combretum kraussii. none of the investigated plants showed any potential mutagenic effects.
antibacterial activity from penicillium corylophilum dierckx.
a strain of penicillium corylophilum isolated from brazilian soil sample was submitted to different culture conditions to investigate the production of secondary metabolites with antimicrobial activity. the largest number of conidia was obtained after 5 days of incubation in oat medium and the highest level of antimicrobial activity was produced when the fungus culture was developed in the czapek medium. the activity against staphylococcus aureus was found only in the chloroform extract from czapek culture broth, which also showed activity against micrococcus luteus. fumiquinozoline f was isolated from the active chloroform extract by using chromatographic methods. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for m. luteus and s. aureus were 99 microg/ ml and 137microg/ml, respectively.

benzenic extracts from both stems and leaves of heterophyllaea pustulata showed the most significant activity in vivo in the brine shrimp lethally test (bst), relative to others of different polarity. they were therefore selected for in vitro antimicrobial activity studies. bacteriostatic activity against micrococcus luteus atcc 9341 was detected, selectively inhibiting both oxacillin-sensitive and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, among several gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial species tested. antifungal activity against important opportunist microorganisms and against those involved in superficial mycosis, all from nosocomial origin was also detected. a chemical screening revealed the presence of anthraquinones as major compounds. among them, we identified damnacanthal, rubiadin, 2-hydroxy-3-methyl anthraquinone, soranjidiol, rubiadin-1-methyl ether, and damnacanthol in the benzenic stem extract. the benzenic leaf extract shows a similar chemical composition, except for damnacanthal, damnacanthol, soranjidiol-1-methyl ether, and 3 anthraquinones whose structures have not yet been elucidated. acute toxicity studies revealed a low toxicity in mice for the anthraquinonic extracts, as measured in the ld50 value (123 mg/kg body wt. i.v.), and death was not observed at doses of up to 4000 mg/kg body wt. s.c.
chemical constituents and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of lantana  xenica.
the aim of this work was to evaluate the chemical composition of lantana xenica essential oil and its antimicrobial activity. the oil from the aerial parts of lantana xenica mold. (verbenacea) was obtained by steam distillation and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. the major constituent of the oil was (e)-caryophyllene (35.2 %), with minor amounts of gamma-cadinene (13.3 %), alpha-pinene (9.3 %), ocimene (9.2 %) and germacrene d (6.6 %). the antimicrobial assays showed that the essential oil of l. xenica inhibited the growth of bacillus cereus and proteus mirabilis and both bacteria were inhibited by (e)-caryophyllene, the major component of the oil. enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis and s. aureus showed a lower inhibition. the bacteria micrococcus luteus, klebsiella sp., escherichia coli and the yeast candida albicans were insensitive to both the oil and (e)-caryophyllene.
antimicrobial studies on three species of hypericum from the canary islands.
the antimicrobial activity of several extracts and fractions of the aerial parts  of hypericum canariense, hypericum glandulosum and hypericum grandifolium was investigated using the disc diffusion and broth microdilution methods against twelve reference microorganisms (eight bacterial and four fungal strains). the methanol extract and chloroform fraction of h. canariense, as well as the methanol extracts, butanol and chloroform fractions of both h. glandulosum and h. grandifolium exhibited a good antibacterial activity against four gram-positive bacteria (bacillus cereus var. mycoides, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis) and the gram-negative bacterium bordetella bronchiseptica with the diameters of growth inhibition area in the range 10-25 mm and mics values between 0.03 and 0.29 mg/ml. neither the infusions and aqueous fractions of the species studied nor the butanol fraction of h. canariense showed any antibacterial activity against the tested microorganisms. amongst the active extracts, the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) determination showed that the h. canariense chloroform fraction was the most active against m. luteus, s. aureus and s. epidermidis. no antifungal activity was seen with any of the extracts or fractions tested. the results of this study support the use of these species in canarian traditional medicine to treat skin infections.
the antibacterial properties of secreted phospholipases a2: a major physiological role for the group iia enzyme that depends on the very high pi of the enzyme to allow penetration of the bacterial cell wall.
the antibacterial properties of human group iia secreted phospholipase a(2) against gram-positive bacteria as a result of membrane hydrolysis have been reported. using micrococcus luteus as a model system, we demonstrate the very high specificity of this human enzyme for such hydrolysis compared with the group ib, iie, iif, v, and x human secreted phospholipase a(2)s. a unique feature of the group iia enzyme is its very high pi due to a large excess of cationic residues on the enzyme surface. the importance of this global positive charge in bacterial cell membrane hydrolysis and bacterial killing has been examined using charge reversal mutagenesis. the global positive charge on the enzyme surface allows penetration through the bacterial cell wall, thus allowing access of this enzyme to the cell membrane. reduced bacterial killing was associated with the loss of positive charge and reduced cell membrane hydrolysis. all mutants were highly effective in hydrolyzing the bacterial membrane of cells in which the cell wall was permeabilized with lysozyme. these same overall characteristics were also seen with suspensions of staphylococcus aureus and listeria innocua, where cell membrane hydrolysis and antibacterial activity of human group iia enzyme was also lost as a result of charge reversal mutagenesis.
antimicrobial activity of essential oils and ethanol extract of phlomis fruticosa l. (lamiaceae).
the essential oils and an ethanol extract of phlomis fruticosa l. were evaluated  for antibacterial and antifungal activities. seven bacterial and seven fungal species were used. among them were human, animal and plant pathogens, food poisoning bacteria and fungi which are known as potential mycotoxin producers. the essential oils showed antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and micrococcus luteus. the essential oils extracted from the plants collected from two different localities showed similar antibacterial activities. the antifungal activity of the essential oils was positive against aspergillus niger, a. ochraceus, cladosporium cladosporioides, fusarium tricinctum and phomopsis helianthi. the ethanol extract showed antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis and antifungal activity against aspergillus niger, a. ochraceus, cladosporium cladosporioides, fusarium tricinctum and phomopsis helianthi.
two-component anti-staphylococcus aureus lantibiotic activity produced by staphylococcus aureus c55.
staphylococcus aureus c55 was shown to produce bacteriocin activity comprising three distinct peptide components, termed staphylococcins c55alpha, c55beta, and c55gamma. the three peptides were purified to homogeneity by a simple four-step purification procedure that consisted of ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by xad-2 and reversed-phase (c8 and c18) chromatography. the yield following c8 chromatography was about 86%, with a more-than-300-fold increase in specific activity. when combined in approximately equimolar amounts, staphylococcins c55alpha and c55beta acted synergistically to kill s. aureus or micrococcus luteus but not s. epidermidis strains. the n-terminal amino acid sequences of all three peptides were obtained and staphylococcins c55alpha and c55beta were shown to be lanthionine-containing (lantibiotic) molecules with molecular weights of 3,339 and 2,993, respectively. the c55gamma peptide did not appear to be a lantibiotic, nor did it augment the inhibitory activities of staphylococcin c55alpha and/or c55beta. plasmids of 2. 5 and 32.0 kb are present in strain c55, and following growth of this strain at elevated temperature (42 degreesc), a large proportion of the progeny failed to produce strong bacteriocin activity and also lost the 32.0-kb plasmid. protoplast transformation of these bacteria with purified 32-kb plasmid dna regenerates the ability to produce the strong bacteriocin activity.
characterization of antibacterial cooh-terminal proenkephalin-a-derived peptides  (peap) in infectious fluids. importance of enkelytin, the antibacterial peap209-237 secreted by stimulated chromaffin cells.
proenkephalin-a (pea) and its derived peptides (peap) have been described in neural, neuroendocrine tissues and immune cells. the processing of pea has been extensively studied in the adrenal medulla chromaffin cell showing that maturation starts with the removal of the carboxyl-terminal peap209-239. in 1995, our laboratory has shown that antibacterial activity is present within the intragranular chromaffin granule matrix and in the extracellular medium following exocytosis. more recently, we have identified an intragranular peptide, named enkelytin, corresponding to the bisphosphorylated peap209-237, that inhibits the growth of micrococcus luteus (goumon, y., strub, j. m., moniatte, m., nullans, g., poteur, l., hubert, p., van dorsselaer, a., aunis, d., and metz-boutigue, m. h. (1996) eur. j. biochem. 235, 516-525). as a continuation of this previous study, in order to characterize the biological function of antibacterial peap, we have here examined whether this cooh-terminal fragment is released from stimulated chromaffin cells and whether it could be detected in wound fluids and in polymorphonuclear secretions following cell stimulation. the antibacterial spectrum shows that enkelytin is active against several gram-positive bacteria including staphylococcus aureus, but it is unable to inhibit the gram-negative bacteria growth. in order to relate the antibacterial activity of enkelytin with structural features, various synthetic enkelytin-derived peptides were tested. we also propose a computer model of synthetic peap209-237 deduced from 1h nmr analysis, in order to relate the antibacterial activity of enkelytin with the three-dimensional structure. finally, we report the high phylogenetic conservation of the cooh-terminal peap, which implies some important biological function and we discuss the putative importance of enkelytin in the defensive processes.
production of a mixture of antimicrobial organic acids from lactose by co-culture of bifidobacterium longum and propionibacterium freudenreichii.
the antimicrobial activities of standard solutions of three organic acids (lactic, acetic, and propionic acids) were compared using micrococcus luteus, pseudomonas sp. and staphylococcus aureus as test microorganisms. at the same concentrations of the undissociated form, the antimicrobial activities of acetic and propionic acids were higher than that of lactic acid, irrespective of test microorganisms. in a single cultivation of bifidobacterium longum, a mixture of lactic (17 g/l) and acetic (20 g/l) acids was produced from 50 g/l lactose and its antimicrobial activities against m. luteus, pseudomonas sp., and s. aureus correspond to that of 32, 19, and 25 g/l of acetic acid, respectively. to increase the total antimicrobial activity, a co-culture of b. longum and propionibacterium freudenreichii, in which lactic acid produced once from lactose by b. longum was converted to acetic and propionic acids by p. freudenreichii, was done using tpy medium containing commercially available peptones as a nitrogen source. by the sequential conversion of lactose using the two microorganisms, the culture supernatant containing a mixture of acetic (27 g/l) and propionic (13 g/l) acids without lactic acid was produced. the antimicrobial activities of the mixture against m. luteus, pseudomonas sp., and s. aureus were 35, 30, and 26 g/l as a concentration of acetic acid, respectively, higher than that obtained in the cultivation of b. longum alone. when the medium containing an enzymatic hydrolyzate of whey proteins with a protease was used in the co-culture of b. longum and p. freudenreichii, the culture supernatant containing the mixture of organic acids was also obtained in the same manner as the co-culture using tpy medium and the activities were 43, 29, and 29 g/l as a concentration of acetic acid for m. luteus, pseudomonas sp. and s. aureus, respectively.
in vitro determination of direct antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide.
the objective of this study was to determine in vitro the time required for calcium hydroxide in direct contact with microorganisms to express its antimicrobial effect. the microorganisms used were: micrococcus luteus (atcc-9341), staphylococcus aureus (atcc-6538), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc-25586), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc-27853), escherichia coli, and streptococcus sp. the strains were cultivated in brain heart infusion (bhi), with the exception of f. nucleatum (bhi-pras). pure and mixed suspensions of the microorganisms were prepared. paper cones immersed in these substances were covered with calcium hydroxide paste, and after 0, 1, 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h and 7 days they were transferred to an appropriate medium to observe the growth and multiplication of the microorganisms. incubation was conducted at 37 degrees c for 48 h, according to the requirements of oxygen of each microorganism. the antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide was shown to occur after 12 h on m. luteus and f. nucleatum, 24 h on streptococcus sp, 48 h on e. coli, and 72 h on s. aureus and p. aeruginosa. mixture ii (m. luteus + streptococcus sp + s. aureus) was sensitive to calcium hydroxide antimicrobial potential after 48 h, whereas mixture i (m. luteus + e. coli + p. aeruginosa), mixture iii (e. coli + p. aeruginosa), and mixture iv (s. aureus + p. aeruginosa) were inactivated after 72 h of exposure.
hyperproduction of alpha-toxin by staphylococcus aureus results in paradoxically  reduced virulence in experimental endocarditis: a host defense role for platelet microbicidal proteins.
staphylococcal alpha-toxin targets several cell types which are important components of cardiac vegetations in endocarditis, including platelets, erythrocytes, and endothelial cells. we evaluated the in vivo role of staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin in experimental endocarditis by using isogenic strains differing in the capacity to produce functional alpha-toxin, including 8325-4 (wild-type strain), du-1090 (a mutant strain with allelic replacement of the alpha-toxin gene [hla]), du1090(ph35l) (a mutant strain producing a target cell-binding but nonlytic toxin), du1090(pdu1212) (a variant of du1090 carrying the cloned hla gene on a multicopy plasmid), and du1090(pcl84::hla) (a variant of du1090 with a single copy of the hla gene cloned into the chromosomal lipase locus). in vitro, wild-type alpha-toxin (from parental strain 8325-4) extensively lysed both erythrocytes and platelets. in contrast, mutant alpha-toxin [from strain du1090(ph35l)] lysed neither cell type. following exposure to the wild-type alpha-toxin, platelet lysates were found to contain microbicidal activity against bacillus subtilis (but not against micrococcus luteus), as well as against the parental and alpha-toxin variant s. aureus strains noted above. furthermore, lysate microbicidal activity was heat stable, neutralized by polyanionic filters or compounds, and recoverable from anionic filter membranes by hypertonic saline elution. these characteristics are consistent with those of cationic platelet microbicidal proteins (pmps). reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis confirmed the presence of three distinct pmps (1, 2, and 3) in platelet lysates. in experimental endocarditis, the two variant staphylococcal strains producing either minimal alpha-toxin or nonlytic alpha-toxin in vitro [strains du1090 and du1090(ph35l), respectively] exhibited significantly lower virulence in vivo than the parental strain (decreased intravegetation staphylococcal densities). paradoxically, the two variant staphylococcal strains producing alpha-toxin at supraparental levels in vitro [strains du1090(p1212) and du1090(pcl84::hla)] also exhibited significantly decreased induction rates and intravegetation staphylococcal densities in experimental endocarditis versus the parental strain. the reduced in vivo virulence of the latter variant staphylococcal strains could not be explained by differences in bacteremic clearance or initial adherence to sterile vegetations (compared to the parental strain). these findings suggest that the reduced virulence exhibited by the variant staphylococcal strains in this model was related to pathogenetic events subsequent to bacterial adherence to the damaged endocardium. excess intravegetation secretion of alpha-toxin, leading to increased pmp release (secondary to either increased platelet secretion or lysis), may well explain the reduced virulence observed in experimental endocarditis.
humoral defense of the nematode ascaris suum: antibacterial, bacteriolytic and agglutinating activities in the body fluid.
three humoral defense activities (antibacterial, bacteriolytic and agglutinating) were detected in the body fluid of the nematode ascaris suum. gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis) were more sensitive to the antibacterial activity than the gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli). the antibacterial activity was heat stable and was lost by trypsin digestion. the molecular mass of the factor responsible for antibacterial activity was estimated as 6 kda. the bacteriolytic activity against dried micrococcus luteus was also detected. the bacteriolytic factor was 6-9 kda in molecular mass, heat sensitive and trypsin sensitive. both e. coli and glutaraldehyde-fixed trypsin-treated human a-type red blood cells were agglutinated in the body fluid. an analytical gel permeation hplc revealed the agglutinating activity consists of at least two factors. activities of both agglutinating factors were lost by heat treatment or trypsin digestion. the molecular masses estimated for the two agglutinating factors were 500 kda and 25 kda. under experimental conditions, microbe-injection was not a prerequisite for the appearance of these defense activities.
[bacteria-reducing properties of copper-containing and non-copper-containing materials. ii. relationship between microbiocide effect of copper-containing materials and copper ion concentration after contamination with moist and dry hands].
the bactericide quality of different materials containing copper (copper, brass,  brass-sheet) was tested and particularly the effect of humidity and copper-concentration was examined. in first examinations (i. communication) (19) the materials were contaminated by hands, which were dipped into a suspension of different microorganisms (micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa). the survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined after defined exposure times (0, 5, 30, 60, 120 min). the following ways of contaminating the test materials were chosen: single contamination with wet hands, repeated contamination with wet and dry hands. in this examination the results were tested for statistical significance and in parallel experiments the copper-concentration on the surfaces of the materials was determined. materials containing copper contaminated with wet hands show a significant bactericide effect after an exposure time of 120 min. the bactericide effect on micrococcus luteus and pseudomonas aeruginosa is inhibited after contamination with dry hands. this results can not be explained by a different copper-concentration on the surfaces of the materials, because a statistically significant difference of copper-ion concentrations between contamination with wet and dry hands could not be obtained.
the ability of bacteria to synthesize a new cyclopyrophosphate correlates with their tolerance to redox-cycling drugs: on a crossroad of chemotherapy, environmental toxicology and immunobiochemical problems.
many redox-cyclers were recently shown to induce, in some bacterial species, large-scale biosynthesis of a new 2-methylbutan-1,2,3,4-tetraol-2,4-cyclopyrophosphate believed to be involved in anti-stress reactions. in the present study mycobacterium smegmatis, micrococcus luteus and brevibacterium ammoniagenes were shown to begin synthesis of the new cyclopyrophosphate when cultivated in a medium containing furacilin or furadonin (widely used nitrofuran antibacterial drugs) and to maintain close to normal growth rates, whereas staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis and escherichia coli were inhibited by the drugs and were unable to synthesize the cyclopyrophosphate compound. preferential binding of mg2+ and cd2+ with one or other phosphoryl groups of the cyclopyrophosphate, which was indicated by selective changes of 31p-nmr chemical shifts and intramolecular hydrogen bonding, is suggested as a reason for this selectivity.
hemolytic interactions of dermatophilus congolensis.
the strains of dermatophilus congolensis grew on blood agar with washed sheep erythrocytes with marked total hemolysis. in testing for hemolytic interactions they gave a significant synergistic effect of a characteristic shape with rhodococcus equi and streptococcus agalactiae, whereas with staphylococcus aureus producing beta hemolysin and with staphylococcus aureus producing delta hemolysin a simultaneous synergistic as well as antagonistic effect were observed. first of all a conspicuous inhibition of in the beta hemolysin zone began and then the hemolytic effect of d. congolensis was enhanced. a similar double reaction was also observed with listeria ivanovii. with delta hemolysin there was an inhibition of the hemolytic effect of d. congolensis and at the same time a synergistic effect could be observed. also d. congolensis gave a weak synergistic effect with micrococcus lylae and listeria monocytogenes, and a further weak antagonistic effect with alpha hemolysin of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hyicus, staphylococcus chromogenes and micrococcus luteus. no interaction of d. congolensis was established with corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis.
antimicrobial activity of sphingosines.
the antimicrobial activity of stratum corneum lipids was examined by screening in vitro various representative phospholipids and sphingolipids. of mixed galacto-cerebrosides; phosphatidic acid; phosphatidic acid-monomethylester-dioleoyl; phosphatidylethanolamine; phosphatidylethanolamine-beta-oleoyl-gamma-palmitoyl; phosphatidylcholine; d-sphingosine; d,l-sphinganine; 4-d-hydroxysphinganine; oleoyl-sphingosine; n,n-dimethylsphingosine; and stearylamine, only the sphingosines and, to a lesser extent, stearylamine were clearly and profoundly effective against staphylococcus aureus (4-log reduction at 6.25 micrograms/ml [20 microm]; 2-log reduction at 0.78 mu/ml [2.5 microm]). the sphingosines were similarly active against streptococcus pyogenes, micrococcus luteus, propionibacterium acnes, brevibacterium epidermidis, and candida albicans, moderately active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ineffective against escherichia coli and serratia marcescens. both erythro- and threo-isomers were effective. optimal inhibition was at 60 min incubation at 37 degrees c and at ph 6.5. antimicrobial activity, which was ca++ dependent, was confirmed in vivo by topical application and microbial challenge. because free sphingosines are available in the stratum corneum and other epidermal layers, these lipids may contribute to the cutaneous antimicrobial barrier.
[antibacterial activity of cervical mucus in pregnant or non-pregnant women].
antibacterial activities of human cervical mucus obtained from non-pregnant and pregnant women were tested using standard blood agar plates. the combined effect of cervical mucus with cefmetazole (cmz) was also investigated. obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. cervical mucus specimens obtained from 6 subjects at 9 to 36 weeks of pregnancy showed antibacterial activity to only one strain of bacillus subtilis among organisms tested. the cervical mucus enhanced the activity of cmz against 1 strain of streptococcus pyogenes and 2 strains of micrococcus luteus, but no effect was observed against other organisms tested. 2. cervical mucus specimens obtained from non-pregnant women showed antibacterial activities to 8 of 11 strains (72.7%) of b. subtilis tested. the cervical mucus enhanced the activities of cmz against 1 strain of s. pyogenes and 3 strains of b. subtilis. the tested organisms included staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, s. pyogenes, b. subtilis, m. luteus, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, and candida albicans, but, as described above, cervical mucus samples showed antimicrobial activities only against b. subtilis (9/17, 52.9%), and specimens obtained only from non-pregnant women or pregnant women with less than 11 weeks of pregnancy showed any antimicrobial activities.
[antibacterial properties of some spice plants before and after heat treatment].
this study was carried out to understand the antibacterial properties of some spice plants before and after heat treatment in boiling water. the samples included the core and the outer layers of onion, the white and the green parts of green onion, garlic bulb, ginger, ginger root, sweet pepper, chili pepper, brown pepper, and mustard. the test microorganisms included escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, vibrio parahaemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, mycobacterium phlei, streptococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, and micrococcus luteus. raw garlic bulb could inhibit all of the test strains. the antibacterial activities of green onion are slightly weak than that of onion. however, green onion could inhibit p. aeruginosa and m. luteus, but onion could inhibit e. coli, p. vulgaris, s. faecalis, and b. cereus. ginger and ginger root could only inhibit m. luteus. chili pepper could inhibit v. parahaemolyticus and p. vulgaris. brown pepper could also inhibit p. vulgaris. sweet pepper and mustard showed no antibacterial activity to all of the test strains. in general, antibacterial components in the spice plants were heat labile. all the spices tested lost their antibacterial activities within 20 min at 100 degrees c.
[reactivity to bacterial peptidoglycans in a phagocytosis system. the range of immunological specificity of escherichia coli peptidoglycan].
the antigenic specificity of e. coli m17 peptidoglycans (pg) was studied in the test system based on the stimulation of neutrophils with pg opsonized with the whole and exhausted igg fraction of human serum. within the generic taxon, the pg under study were similar in their antigenic properties. the opsonic activity of igg exhausted with the preparations of different e. coli strains decreased by 93.2-95.8%. an essential difference of e. coli pg from similar components of other representatives of the family enterobacteriaceae was observed: in experiments with serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri the decrease of opsonic activity was 47.6-79.3%. after the removal of antibodies to pg of remote taxons (staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, branchamella catarrhalis) the decrease of the opsonic effect was less noticeable (9.7-33.8%). the results are discussed from the viewpoint of the immunological peculiarity of pg at different taxonomic levels.
effect of saccharin on growth and acid production of glucose-grown pathogenic and oral bacteria.
growth and acid production of glucose-grown gram-positive and gram-negative rods  as well as cocci from the human oral cavity were studied in the presence of 0.02 to 20.00 mg/ml sodium saccharin. all gram-positive rods, i.e. actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis and corynebacterium diphtheriae, and gram-positive cocci, i.e. streptococcus spp, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus, were significantly inhibited by saccharin, especially at the higher concentrations. while gram-negative cocci, i.e. veillonella sp and neisseria sicca were strongly inhibited by all tested saccharin concentrations, gram-negative rods, i.e. the enterics and acinetobacter sp, exhibited little if any inhibition. saccharin caused a significant reduction in fermentative acid production congruent with observed growth.
[reactivity to bacterial peptidoglycans in a phagocytosis system. 1. the range of immunological specificity of staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan].
the antigenic features of s. aureus peptidoglycan (pg) were studied in the reaction of stimulation of oxygen-dependent neutrophil metabolism, mediated by the igg opsonins of normal human serum. the study was carried out at different taxonomic levels: the species (s. aureus), the genus (staphylococcus), the family (micrococcaceae), as well as in relation to remote taxons (organisms belonging to the families streptococcaceae, enterobacteriaceae, neisseriaceae, to the genus corynebacterium). all s. aureus strains were identical with respect to the specificity of their pg, essentially differing from other bacteria in this regard. after the removal of antibodies to different pg the effectiveness of pg opsonization decreased by 10.4-44.7%. such decrease was most pronounced in experiments with the pg of streptococci (s. pyogenes, s. faecalis, s. salivarius) and micrococcus luteus.
biochemical and physical properties of the endo-beta-n-acetylglucosaminidases from staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus simulans, and staphylococcus saprophyticus.
biochemical and physical properties of the pure bacteriolytic enzymes excreted by three different staphylococcus species (s. aureus, s. simulans, and s. saprophyticus) were investigated. although the three enzymes have previously been shown to share the same specificity of action (endo-beta-n-acetylglucosaminidase activity), their biochemical features clearly indicated that they were three different enzymes, confirming what had previously been suggested by the different lytic-activity patterns displayed by each species and the different procedures needed to achieve purification of each enzyme. very different values resulted from molecular weight determination: 80,000 for the s. aureus enzyme, 45,000 for the s. simulans enzyme and 31,000 for the s. saprophyticus enzyme. other important differences were observed in their kinetics of activity on micrococcus luteus purified cell walls; their stability; their bacteriolytic spectrum against heat-killed cells of various microorganisms; and their response to physical and chemical factors, such as temperature, ph, ionic strength, divalent cations, chelating agents, thiol compounds, and glucose derivatives.
[effect of antibiotic al-87 on the fatty acid composition of microorganisms in different taxonomic groups].
the effect of antibiotic a1-87 on the fatty acid composition of s. aureus 209, e. coli o26 and m. luteus 169 significantly differing in this property was studied. the sub-bacteriostatic doses of the preparation induced the appearance of unsaturated fatty acids in s. aureus 209. these acids were not detected in the control cultures. they also significantly increased the content of the saturated branched fatty acid with 15 carbon atoms in this culture and decreased the content of the fatty acid of the same type with 19 carbon atoms. in e. coli o25 there was an almost two-fold increase in the content of the unsaturated straight chain fatty acids with a respective decrease in the content of cyclopropanoic acid and a markedly pronounced decrease in the content of nonadecanoic acid. in m. luteus 169 the content of the saturated branched fatty acid with 15 carbon atoms increased, while the content of the unsaturated straight chain fatty acids (c16:1, c18:1) decreased, the content of hexadecanoic acid being decreased almost two times. according to the present status the differences in the fatty acid composition of the above organisms are interpreted as one of the mechanisms increasing the membrane permeability.
lack of influence of commonly used drugs on bioassay indicator organisms.
many commonly used pharmaceutical agents have been found to inhibit bacterial growth in vitro. determinations of antimicrobial concentrations in sera of patients taking nonrecognized antibacterial agents could possibly be altered if bioassay systems are utilized for the determinations. we therefore attempted to determine the in vitro effect of commonly used drugs on bioassay indicator organisms. fifty-one different agents (antihistamines, anticholinergics, central nervous system agents, cardiovascular agents, analgesics, steroids, muscle blockers, and other miscellaneous agents) were tested for inhibition or enhancement of the growth of bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus, and klebsiella pneumoniae. none of the agents tested exhibited any effect on standard in vitro bioassay organisms. nortriptyline hydrochloride inhibited the growth of b. subtilis and m. luteus at a concentration of 500 micrograms/ml (zones of inhibition, 14 and 13 mm, respectively), but no inhibition was observed with concentrations of 50 micrograms/ml or lower.
interaction of wheat-germ agglutinin with bacterial cells and cell-wall polymers.
wheat germ agglutinin was found to agglutinate cells of escherichia coli pat 84,  micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus h, and of s. aureus 52a5, but not cells of s. aureus 52a2. interaction of wheat germ agglutinin with a soluble linear peptidoglycan secreted by micrococcus luteus and with the teichoic acid of s. aureus h was demonstrated by agar gel diffusion, quantitative precipitation and inhibition of hemagglutination of trypsinized rabbit erythrocytes. no interaction could be demonstrated with the teichoic acid from a phage-resistant mutant (s. aureus 52a2) which lacks a-acetyl-d-glucosamine residues. all interactions were specifically inhibited by low concentrations of chitotriose (glcnacbeta1 leads to 4glcnacbeta1 leads to 4glcnac) and the bacterial cell wall tetrasaccharide, glcnacbeta1 leads to 4murnacbeta1 leads to 4glcnacbeta1 leads to 4murnac. hemagglutination-inhibition experiments showed that the linear peptidoglycan and the teichoic acid of s. aureus h were several thousand times more potent inhibitors of wheat germ agglutinin than was n-acetyl-d-glucosamine. comparison of the efficiency of different saccharides in inhibition of hemagglutination and precipitation of polymers by wheat germ agglutinin, strongly suggests that secondary, non-specific interactions contribute to the binding of the lectin to the polymers.
