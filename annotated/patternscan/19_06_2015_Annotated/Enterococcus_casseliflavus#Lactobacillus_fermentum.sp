TI  == the effects of bee pollen extracts on the broiler chicken's gastrointestinal microflora.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bee pollen ethanolic extracts on the in vivo gastrointestinal tract microflora colonization of broiler chickens. a completely randomized experiment based on six treatments (different concentrations of bee pollen - 0, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 45 g kg(-1) diet) was used during 7 weeks. the highest count of faecal enterococci was found in the experimental group with the addition of 15 g of pollen (8.85 +/- 0.87 log cfu g(-1)) per 1 kg of feed mixture. the highest count of lactobacilli was detected in the experimental group with 35 g of pollen per 1 kg of feed mixture and the highest number of the enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in the control group (8.43 +/- 0.15 log cfu g(-1)). moreover, the maldi tof ms biotyper identified the following genera: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella  oxytoca, as well as lactobacillus acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. fermentum and l.  salivarius from the lactobacilli group and enterococcus avium, e. casseliflavus,  e. cecorum, e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. hirae and e. malodoratus from the enterococci group. additionally, the in vitro antimicrobial activities of pollen against five bacteria species isolated from gastrointestinal tracts of  chickens were tested. the best antimicrobial effect of the pollen extract was detected against k. oxytoca.

TI  == presence of erythromycin and tetracycline resistance genes in lactic acid bacteria from fermented foods of indian origin.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) resistant to erythromycin were isolated from different food samples on selective media. the isolates were identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus lactis, enterococcus casseliflavus, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides. of the total 60 isolates, 88 % harbored the ermb gene. the efflux gene msra was identified in e. faecium, e. durans, e. lactis, e. casseliflavus, p. pentosaceus  and l. fermentum. further analysis of the msra gene by sequencing suggested its homology to msrc. resistance to tetracycline due to the genes tetm, tetw, teto, tetk and tetl, alone or in combination, were identified in lactobacillus species. the tetracycline efflux genes tetk and tetl occurred in p. pentosaceus and enterococcus species. since it appeared that lab had acquired these genes, fermented foods may be a source of antibiotic resistance.

TI  == dynamics and biodiversity of populations of lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid  bacteria involved in spontaneous heap fermentation of cocoa beans in ghana.
AB  == the ghanaian cocoa bean heap fermentation process was studied through a multiphasic approach, encompassing both microbiological and metabolite target analyses. a culture-dependent (plating and incubation, followed by repetitive-sequence-based pcr analyses of picked-up colonies) and culture-independent (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis [dgge] of 16s rrna gene amplicons, pcr-dgge) approach revealed a limited biodiversity and targeted population dynamics of both lactic acid bacteria (lab) and acetic acid bacteria (aab) during fermentation. four main clusters were identified among the lab isolated: lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, and enterococcus casseliflavus. other taxa encompassed, for  instance, weissella. only four clusters were found among the aab identified: acetobacter pasteurianus, acetobacter syzygii-like bacteria, and two small clusters of acetobacter tropicalis-like bacteria. particular strains of l. plantarum, l. fermentum, and a. pasteurianus, originating from the environment, were well adapted to the environmental conditions prevailing during ghanaian cocoa bean heap fermentation and apparently played a significant role in the cocoa bean fermentation process. yeasts produced ethanol from sugars, and lab produced lactic acid, acetic acid, ethanol, and mannitol from sugars and/or citrate. whereas l. plantarum strains were abundant in the beginning of the fermentation, l. fermentum strains converted fructose into mannitol upon prolonged fermentation. a. pasteurianus grew on ethanol, mannitol, and lactate and converted ethanol into acetic acid. a newly proposed weissella sp., referred  to as "weissella ghanaensis," was detected through pcr-dgge analysis in some of the fermentations and was only occasionally picked up through culture-based isolation. two new species of acetobacter were found as well, namely, the species tentatively named "acetobacter senegalensis" (a. tropicalis-like) and "acetobacter ghanaensis" (a. syzygii-like).

TI  == microbiological study of lactic acid fermentation of caper berries by molecular and culture-dependent methods.
AB  == fermentation of capers (the fruits of capparis sp.) was studied by molecular and  culture-independent methods. a lactic acid fermentation occurred following immersion of caper berries in water, resulting in fast acidification and development of the organoleptic properties typical of this fermented food. a collection of 133 isolates obtained at different times of fermentation was reduced to 75 after randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis. isolates were identified by pcr or 16s rrna gene sequencing as lactobacillus plantarum (37 isolates), lactobacillus paraplantarum (1 isolate), lactobacillus pentosus (5 isolates), lactobacillus brevis (9 isolates), lactobacillus fermentum (6 isolates), pediococcus pentosaceus (14 isolates), pediococcus acidilactici (1  isolate), and enterococcus faecium (2 isolates). cluster analysis of rapd-pcr patterns revealed a high degree of diversity among lactobacilli (with four major  groups and five subgroups), while pediococci clustered in two closely related groups. a culture-independent analysis of fermentation samples by temporal temperature gradient electrophoresis (ttge) also indicated that l. plantarum is the predominant species in this fermentation, in agreement with culture-dependent results. the distribution of l. brevis and l. fermentum in samples was also determined by ttge, but identification of pediococcus at the species level was not possible. ttge also allowed a more precise estimation of the distribution of  e. faecium, and the detection of enterococcus casseliflavus (which was not revealed by the culture-dependent analysis). results from this study indicate that complementary data from molecular and culture-dependent analysis provide a more accurate determination of the microbial community dynamics during caper fermentation.
