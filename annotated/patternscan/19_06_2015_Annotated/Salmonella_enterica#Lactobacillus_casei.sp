TI  == reduction of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 infection in experimentally challenged weaned pigs fed a lactobacillus-fermented feed.
AB  == salmonella typhimurium is a foodborne pathogen and commonly present on pig farms. probiotics have shown potential as a means of reducing salmonella shedding in pigs. three experimental challenge trials were conducted to investigate the potential application of newly isolated lactobacillus isolates for controlling salmonella infection in pigs. in each trial, 16 yorkshire piglets (28-d old) were randomly allocated to 1 of 4 dietary treatments: (1) basal diet (bd), (2) naturally fermented (nf) feed, (3) lactobacillus zeae-fermented (lz-f) feed, and  4) lactobacillus casei-fermented (lc-f) feed. all pigs consumed their assigned diets for 3 d prior to the challenge of salmonella typhimurium dt104 (approximately 6 log colony-forming units/pig) through gavage. pediococcus pentosaceus, l. zeae, and l. casei were most abundant in nf, lz-f, and lc-f feed, respectively. after the challenge, pigs on fermented feed had lower rectal temperature, diarrhea scores, serum haptoglobin concentrations, and intestinal salmonella counts than the control group (bd) (p </= 0.01). salmonella spp. were  detected in both ileocecal lymph nodes (icln) and spleens from all pigs on bd, nf, and lc-f, but only 50% of spleens from pigs on lz-f. pigs had a dynamic spatial and temporal immune response to salmonella infection and dietary treatments, as indicated by up- and downregulation in gene expression of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (il)-1beta, il-6, il-10, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor) in the ileum, icln, and spleen. the alternation in cytokine expression by fermented feed, particularly lz-f, appeared to benefit pigs in combating salmonella infection.

TI  == consumption of lactobacillus casei fermented milk prevents salmonella reactive arthritis by modulating il-23/il-17 expression.
AB  == reactive arthritis is the development of sterile joint inflammation as a sequel to a remote infection, often in the gut. we have previously shown that a low dose of s. enteritidis inoculated to streptomycin-pretreated mice generates a self-limiting enterocolitis suitable for studying reactive arthritis. here we show that consumption of lactobacillus casei prior to infection abolishes intestinal and joint inflammation triggered by salmonella. balb/c mice were sacrificed after infection; intestinal and joint samples were analyzed for histological changes and expression of cytokines. tnf-alpha was measured by elisa and the expression of il-1beta, il-6, il-10, il-17, il-23 and tgf-beta was assessed by qpcr. l. casei consumption prevented salmonella-induced synovitis, the increment of tnf-alpha in knees and the increase of il-17 expression in popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes. at intestinal level consumption of l. casei drastically diminished s. enteritidis invasiveness and shortened splenic persistence of the pathogen. bacterial loads recovered at days 2 and 5 from peyer's patches were 10-fold lower in mice fed with l. casei. in accordance, we found that the augment in gut permeability induced during enterocolitis was decreased in those animals. consumption of l. casei prior to infection failed to  increase anti- inflammatory molecules such as il-10 and tgf-beta in the intestine. on the other hand, consumption of l. casei abrogated the expression of tnf-alpha, il-17, il-23, il-1beta and il-6 in cecum and mesenteric lymph nodes. these cytokines are needed for differentiation of immune cells involved in the development of reactive arthritis such as th17 and gammadelta t cells. trafficking of these inflammatory cells from the gut to the joints has been proposed as a mechanism of generation of reactive arthritis. our results suggest  that l. casei consumption prevents salmonella-induced synovitis by altering the intestinal milieu necessary for differentiation of cells involved in the generation of joint inflammation.

TI  == tailoring the probiotic potential of non-starter lactobacillus strains from ripened parmigiano reggiano cheese by in vitro screening and principal component  analysis.
AB  == non-starter lactic acid bacteria (nslab) inhabiting fermented food have been recently revised as source of probiotic strains. here, we in vitro assessed the potential probiotic aptitude of a de-replicated set of nslab previously isolated  from long ripened parmigiano reggiano cheeses (22 lactobacillus rhamnosus, 18 lactobacillus paracasei, 3 lactobacillus casei, 2 lactobacillus harbinensis, and  2 lactobacillus fermentum). most strains showed moderate to good resistance to biological barriers, including bile salts, lysozyme, and simulated gastric and pancreatic juices. antimicrobial susceptibility tests against seven antimicrobials belonging to different categories showed that most strains are susceptible towards all the antibiotics, with the exception of vancomycin and streptomycin. the strains lost the streptomycin resistance when assayed on agar medium containing 0.5% bile salts, suggesting that detergent-like properties of cholic acids increase membrane permeability and mediate streptomycin susceptibility. no isolate showed bile salt hydrolase (bsh) activities, supporting that bile salts resistance and bsh activity are unpaired traits. finally, nslab strains had moderate to high auto-aggregative and hydrophobic phenotypes, whereas two subsets of 22 and 8 strains co-aggregated with escherichia coli and salmonella enterica s. typhimurium, respectively. a multivariate analysis was effective to segregate one l. casei and two l. rhamnosus strains showing physiological characteristics compatible with probiotic properties.

TI  == lack of correlation between in vitro antibiosis and in vivo protection against enteropathogenic bacteria by probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == increased resistance to infection is one of the beneficial effects attributed to  probiotic microorganisms. this effect may be due to several mechanisms: production of inhibitory substances, blocking of adhesion sites on the intestinal surface, competition for nutrients and stimulation of mucosal and systemic immunity. the present study aimed to investigate the correlation between in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of probiotic lactobacilli. the agar spot test  was used to show that twenty lactobacillus strains were able to inhibit the enteropathogenic bacterium yersinia enterocolitica. this inhibition was mainly attributable to a decrease in ph resulting from dextrose fermentation by lactobacilli. the inhibition of y. enterocolitica, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes by two probiotic strains, lactobacillus casei c1 and lactobacillus plantarum c4, was also associated with the ph decrease. however, both strains lacked protective effects in mouse experimental infection models, with the exception of long-lasting pre-treatment with l. plantarum c4, which exerted a partial protective effect against s. typhimurium that was attributable to an immunostimulatory mechanism. our results show that in vitro antibiosis tests do not provide useful information on the probiotic potential of lactobacillus strains.

TI  == antipathogenic activity of probiotics against salmonella typhimurium and clostridium difficile in anaerobic batch culture systems: is it due to synergies  in probiotic mixtures or the specificity of single strains?
AB  == probiotics are currently being investigated for prevention of infections caused by enteric pathogens. the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the influence of three single probiotics: lactobacillus casei ncimb 30185 (pxn 37), lactobacillus acidophilus ncimb 30184 (pxn 35), bifidobacterium breve ncimb 30180 (pxn 25) and a probiotic mixture containing the above strains plus twelve other strains belonging to the lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, lactococcus, streptococcus and bacillus genera on the survival of salmonella typhimurium and clostridium difficile using ph-controlled anaerobic batch cultures containing mixed faecal bacteria. changes in relevant bacterial groups and effects of probiotic addition on survival of the two pathogens were assessed over 24 h. quantitative analysis of bacterial populations revealed that there was a significant increase in lactobacilli and/or bifidobacteria numbers, depending on  probiotic addition, compared with the control (no added probiotic). there was also a significant reduction in s. typhimurium and c. difficile numbers in the presence of certain probiotics compared with controls. of the probiotic treatments, two single strains namely l. casei ncimb 30185 (pxn 37), and b. breve ncimb 30180 (pxn 25) were the most potent in reducing the numbers of s. typhimurium and c. difficile. in addition, the supplementation with probiotics into the systems influenced some fermentations parameters. acetate was found in the largest concentrations in all vessels and lactate and formate were generally  detected in higher amounts in vessels with probiotic addition compared to controls.

TI  == compound(s) secreted by lactobacillus casei strain shirota yit9029 irreversibly and reversibly impair the swimming motility of helicobacter pylori and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, respectively.
AB  == we conducted experiments in order to examine whether the probiotic lactobacillus  casei strain shirota yit9029 (lcs) in vitro and in vivo antagonism of helicobacter pylori and salmonella, involves inhibition of the swimming motility  of these pathogens. we report the irreversible inhibition of the swimming motility of h. pylori strain 1101 and reversible inhibition of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (s. typhimurium) strain sl1344 by compound(s) secreted by lcs. in h. pylori 1101, irreversible inhibition results in the helical cells being progressively replaced by cells with 'c'-shaped and coccoid morphologies, accompanied by a loss of flaa and flab flagellin expression. in s.  typhimurium sl1344, transient inhibition develops after membrane depolarization and without modification of expression of flic flagellin. the inhibitory activity of strain lcs against both s. typhimurium and h. pylori swimming motilities is linked with a small sized, heat-sensitive, and partially trypsin-sensitive, secreted compound(s), and needed the cooperation of the secreted membrane permeabilizing lactic acid metabolite. the inhibition of s. typhimurium sl1344 swimming motility leads to delayed cell entry into human enterocyte-like caco-2/tc7 cells and a strong decrease of cell entry into human mucus-secreting ht29-mtx cells.

TI  == probiotic-mediated competition, exclusion and displacement in biofilm formation by food-borne pathogens.
AB  == the objective of this study was to examine the inhibitory effect of probiotic strains on pathogenic biofilm formation in terms of competition, exclusion and displacement. probiotic strains (lactobacillus acidophilus kacc 12419, lact. casei kacc 12413, lact. paracasei kacc 12427 and lact. rhamnosus kacc 11953) and  pathogens (salmonella typhimurium kccm 40253 and listeria monocytogenes kacc 12671) were used to evaluate the auto-aggregation, hydrophobicity and biofilm formation inhibition. the highest auto-aggregation abilities were observed in lact. rhamnosus (17.5%), lact. casei (17.2%) and lact. acidophilus (15.1%). salm. typhimurium had the highest affinity to xylene, showing the hydrophobicity of 53.7%. the numbers of l. monocytogenes biofilm cells during the competition, exclusion and displacement assays were effectively reduced by more than 3 log when co-cultured with lact. paracasei and lact. rhamnosus. the results suggest that probiotic strains can be used as alternative way to effectively reduce the biofilm formation in pathogenic bacteria through competition, exclusion and displacement.

TI  == comparative study of the protective capacity against salmonella infection between probiotic and nonprobiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == aims: to investigate the immunoprotective ability of three lactobacilli strains against salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium in a mouse model. to identify the probiotic properties involved in the protection against infection caused by this  pathogen. methods and results: the immunomodulatory effect of three different lactobacilli strains: lactobacillus (lact.) casei crl 431 (probiotic bacterium),  lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus crl 423 (lact. bulgaricus) and lact.acidophilus crl 730 was compared using a mouse model of salmonella infection. lactobacillus casei continuous administration improved animal survival, diminished pathogen spreading outside the intestine, attenuated the intestinal inflammation, modulated cytokine profile previous and postinfection and increased the expression and secretion of iga in the gut. additionally, the administration of this lactobacilli increased peritoneal, peyer's patches and spleen macrophages' phagocytic activity in healthy mice and monocyte chemotactic  protein (mcp-1) released by intestinal epithelial cells in an in vitro assay. although lact. acidophilus increased the number of iga-secreting cells previous and postinfection, and lact. bulgaricus increased mcp-1 released by intestinal epithelial cells and the phagocytic activity of macrophages, these effects alone  were not enough to confer protection against salmonella typhimurium infection in  mouse. conclusions: probiotic strain lact. casei crl 431 was the one that induced protection against salmonella, by increasing the intestinal barrier function and  by decreasing the local inflammatory response. significance and impact of the study: salmonella spp. constitutes an important agent of foodborne diseases in the world. not all lactobacilli, even with some immunostimulating properties at gut level, can protect against salmonella infection. lactobacillus casei crl 431, a probiotic bacterium, could be useful as an oral mucosal adjuvant of the immune  system to improve gut health, especially in the prevention or amelioration of salmonella infections. we demonstrated that there is not a unique mechanism by which this protective effect was exerted.

TI  == pathogen translocation and histopathological lesions in an experimental model of  salmonella dublin infection in calves receiving lactic acid bacteria and lactose  supplements.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the capacity of a lactic acid bacteria  (lab) inoculum to protect calves with or without lactose supplements against salmonella dublin infection by evaluating histopathological lesions and pathogen  translocation. fifteen calves were divided into three groups [control group (c-g), a group inoculated with lab (lab-g), and a group inoculated with lab and given lactose supplements (l-lab-g)] with five, six, and four animals, respectively. the inoculum, composed of lactobacillus (l.) casei dspv 318t, l. salivarius dspv 315t, and pediococcus acidilactici dspv 006t, was administered with milk replacer. the lab-g and l-lab-g received a daily dose of 10(9) cfu/kg body weight of each strain throughout the experiment. lactose was provided to the l-lab-g in doses of 100 g/day. salmonella dublin (2 x 10(10) cfu) was orally administered to all animals on day 11 of the experiment. the microscopic lesion index values in target organs were 83%, 70%, and 64.3% (p < 0.05) for the c-g, lab-g, and l-lab-g, respectively. administration of the probiotic inoculum was not fully effective against infection caused by salmonella. although probiotic treatment was unable to delay the arrival of pathogen to target organs, it was evident that the inoculum altered the response of animals against pathogen infection.

TI  == [protection against salmonella via immunization with recombinant lactic acid bacteria].
AB  == mucosal immunization of hens may be effective to prevent contamination of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis (se) in eggs. lactic acid bacteria have been considered potential vaccine delivery agents because they are safe, immunogenic, and inexpensive. our research group has been investigating the development of oral vaccines against se using a lactobacillus casei strain as an  antigen delivery vehicle. recombinant lactobacilli expressing se antigens flic and sipc have been constructed and administered to mice. antigen specific immune  responses and protective immunity were elicited after the immunization. for adjuvant delivery, il-1beta-secreting l. casei was also engineered and its efficacies were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. this article reviews a novel approach to develop se vaccines using recombinant lactobacilli.

TI  == effects of bile salt deconjugation by probiotic strains on the survival of antibiotic-resistant foodborne pathogens under simulated gastric conditions.
AB  == this study was designed to evaluate the effects of bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains on the antibiotic susceptibility of antibiotic-sensitive and multiple antibiotic-resistant salmonella typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus. eight probiotic strains, bifidobacterium longum b6, lactobacillus acidophilus adh, lactobacillus brevis kacc 10553, lactobacillus casei kacc 12413, lactobacillus paracasei atcc 25598, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, leuconostoc mesenteroides kacc 12312, and pediococcus acidilactici kacc 12307, were used to examine bile acid tolerance. the ability to deconjugate bile acids was evaluated  using both thin-layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography.  the antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out to determine the synergistic inhibitory activity of deconjugated bile acids. l. acidophilus, l. brevis, and p. acidilactici showed the most tolerance to the conjugated bile acids. p. acidilactici deconjugated glycocholic acid and glycodeoxycholate from 3.18 and 3.09 mm to the detection limits, respectively. the antibiotic susceptibility of selected foodborne pathogens was increased by increasing the concentration of deconjugated bile acids. the study results are useful for understanding the relationship between bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains and antibiotic susceptibility in the presence of deconjugated bile acids, and they may be useful for designing new probiotic-antibiotic combination therapy based on bile acid deconjugation.

TI  == oral administration of a probiotic lactobacillus modulates cytokine production and tlr expression improving the immune response against salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium infection in mice.
AB  == background: diarrheal infections caused by salmonella, are one of the major causes of childhood morbidity and mortality in developing countries. salmonella causes various diseases that range from mild gastroenteritis to enteric fever, depending on the serovar involved, infective dose, species, age and immune status of the host. probiotics are proposed as an attractive alternative possibility in  the prevention against this pathogen infection. previously we demonstrated that continuous lactobacillus casei crl 431 administration to balb/c mice before and after challenge with salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (s. typhimurium) decreased the severity of salmonella infection. the aim of the present work was to deep into the knowledge about how this probiotic bacterium exerts its effect,  by assessing its impact on the expression and secretion of pro-inflammatory (tnfalpha, ifngamma) and anti-inflammatory (il-10) cytokines in the inductor and  effector sites of the gut immune response, and analyzing toll-like receptor (tlr2, tlr4, tlr5 and tlr9) expressions in both healthy and infected mice. results: probiotic administration to healthy mice increased the expression of tlr2, tlr4 and tlr9 and improved the production and secretion of tnfalpha, ifngamma and il-10 in the inductor sites of the gut immune response (peyer's patches). post infection, the continuous probiotic administration, before and after salmonella challenge, protected the host by modulating the inflammatory response, mainly in the immune effector site of the gut, decreasing tnfalpha and  increasing ifngamma, il-6 and il-10 production in the lamina propria of the small intestine. conclusions: the oral administration of l. casei crl 431 induces variations in the cytokine profile and in the tlrs expression previous and also after the challenge with s. typhimurium. these changes show some of the immune mechanisms implicated in the protective effect of this probiotic strain against s. typhimurium, providing an alternative way to reduce the severity of the infection.

TI  == efficacy of an anaerobic swab transport system to maintain aerobic and anaerobic  microorganism viability after storage at -80 degrees c.
AB  == an amies agar gel swab transport system was evaluated for its ability to maintain bacterial viability and relative quantity after freezing at -80 degrees c. nine american type culture collection (atcc) bacterial strains were used: 3 anaerobic  strains (propionibacterium acnes, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and clostridium  sporogenes) and 6 facultative or strict aerobic bacterial strains (stenotrophomonas maltophilia, escherichia coli ([atcc 25922 and atcc 11775], salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium, staphylococcus saprophyticus, and lactobacillus casei). the bacterial species were chosen because they corresponded to bacteria identified in psittacine feces and cloacal  samples. there were no significant differences between growth scores at baseline  and after storage at -80 degrees c for 40 days for any of the bacteria examined after 48 and 72 hr of incubation, with the exception of p. anaerobius. for p. anaerobius, there was a significant reduction (p < 0.001) in the growth score after storage at -80 degrees c for 40 days from that of the baseline; however, the bacteria were still viable. the tested swab transport system may be useful when lengthy storage and transport times necessitate freezing samples prior to culture.

TI  == development of recombinant vaccines in lactobacilli for elimination of salmonella.
AB  == many lactobacillus and lactococcus strains are generally regarded as safe for consumption because they are utilized for food fermentation or inhabit the intestinal mucosa as commensals. recently, vaccine delivery systems using lactic  acid bacteria (lab) have been under development. our research group has been investigating the development of oral mucosal vaccines against salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis (se) using lactobacillus casei igm393 as an antigen  delivery vehicle. recombinant lactobacilli expressing se antigens, flic, sipc, and ompc, have been constructed and orally administered to mice. antigen specific immune responses and protective immunity were elicited after the immunization. for adjuvant-delivery, il-1beta-secreting l. casei was also engineered and its effects evaluated in vitro and in vivo. this article reviews a novel approach to  the elimination of salmonella via the development of a vaccine in lactobacilli.

TI  == bactericidal activity of mouse alpha-defensin cryptdin-4 predominantly affects noncommensal bacteria.
AB  == mouse paneth cell alpha-defensins, termed cryptdins, are secreted into the intestinal lumen, have microbicidal activity, and contribute to intestinal innate immunity. among them, cryptdin-4 (crp4) has the most potent microbicidal activity. in the intestinal lumen, commensal bacteria colonize and elicit beneficial effects in the host. however, the effects of crp4 against commensal bacteria are poorly understood. thus, we investigated the bactericidal activities of crp4 against commensal bacteria compared to noncommensal bacteria. oxidized crp4 showed only minimal or no bactericidal activity against 8 out of 12 commensal bacterial species, including bifidobacterium bifidum and lactobacillus  casei. we further addressed a role of the conserved disulfide bonds of crp4 by analyzing reduced crp4 (r-crp4). r-crp4 demonstrated significantly greater bactericidal activities against 7 of 12 commensal bacteria than did oxidized crp4. oxidized crp4 and r-crp4 elicited equivalently potent bactericidal activities against 11 of the 11 noncommensal bacteria tested, such as salmonella  enterica serovar typhimurium,and against 5 of 12 commensal bacteria. furthermore, when r-crp4 was exposed to a processing enzyme of cryptdins, i.e. mmp-7, r-crp4 was degraded and the bactericidal activities disappeared. these findings suggest  that crp4 has selective bactericidal activities against intestinal microbiota and that the activities are dependent on the disulfide bonds.

TI  == protective effect of lactobacillus casei strain shirota against lethal infection  with multi-drug resistant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 in mice.
AB  == aims: the anti-infectious activity of lactobacilli against multi-drug resistant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 (dt104) was examined in a murine model of an opportunistic antibiotic-induced infection. methods and results: explosive intestinal growth and subsequent lethal extra-intestinal translocation  after oral infection with dt104 during fosfomycin (fom) administration was significantly inhibited by continuous oral administration of lactobacillus casei  strain shirota (lcs), which is naturally resistant to fom, at a dose of 10(8) colony-forming units per mouse daily to mice. comparison of the anti-salmonella activity of several lactobacillus type strains with natural resistance to fom revealed that lactobacillus brevis atcc 14869(t) , lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917(t) , lactobacillus reuteri jcm 1112(t) , lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 7469(t) and lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741(t) conferred no activity even when they obtained the high population levels almost similar to those of the effective strains such as lcs, lact. casei atcc 334(t) and lactobacillus zeae atcc 15820(t) . the increase in concentration of organic acids and maintenance of the lower ph in the intestine because of lactobacillus colonization were correlated with the anti-infectious activity. moreover, heat-killed lcs was not protective against the infection, suggesting that the metabolic activity of lactobacilli is important for the anti-infectious activity. conclusion: these results suggest that certain lactobacilli in combination with antibiotics may be  useful for prophylaxis against opportunistic intestinal infections by multi-drug  resistant pathogens, such as dt104. significance and impact of the study: antibiotics such as fom disrupt the metabolic activity of the intestinal microbiota that produce organic acids, and that only probiotic strains that are metabolically active in vivo should be selected to prevent intestinal infection when used clinically in combination with certain antibiotics.

TI  == microbial products from probiotic bacteria inhibit salmonella enteritidis 857-induced il-8 synthesis in caco-2 cells.
AB  == oral administration of lactobacillus spp. as probiotics is gaining importance in  the treatment of intestinal inflammations. however, their mechanism of action is  unknown. we investigated whether nonspecific binding lactobacillus casei shirota  (lcs) and mannose-specific lactobacillus plantarum 299v (lp) and their spent culture supernatant (scs) affect salmonella enteritidis 857 (se) growth, il-8 and hsp70 syntheses. in one set of experiments human enterocyte-like caco-2 cells were infected with lcs, lp or se at 1-500 bacteria per cell for 1 h. in another set, cells were exposed to se (0-200 per cell, 1 h) after exposure to lactobacilli (lb) (500 per cell, 30 min) or by co-incubation of se and lb (1 h).  the third set of experiments involved exposure of cells for 1 h to scs or se (100 per cell) pretreated (1 h) in scs. the effect of lb scs on se growth was evaluated by agar plate diffusion test. il-8 and hsp70 were assessed over 2-24 h  using elisa and western blotting, respectively. neither lcs nor lp affected the se growth and il-8 production. in addition, they did not induce hsp70 expression  by caco-2 cells. instead, their scs inhibited the se growth and il-8 production and induced the expression of hsp70 by both crypt- and villus-like cells. the beneficial effect of lactobacillus spp. to the intestinal inflammations might be  associated with a decrease in il-8 levels. this effect could be mediated, at least in part, via a secreted antimicrobial product(s) either directly against the pathogens or indirectly through the synthesis of hsp70.

TI  == anti-inflammatory properties of probiotic bacteria on salmonella-induced il-8 synthesis in enterocyte-like caco-2 cells.
AB  == invasion of the gut by pathogenic salmonella leads to production of il-8 that initiates inflammatory reactions to combat the bacterium. however, its persistent production causes tissue damage and interventions that suppress il-8 production prevent tissue damage. we hypothesised that probiotics could mediate their benefits via inhibition of il-8 synthesis. caco-2 cells were infected with probiotic bifidobacterium infantis w52, lactobacillus casei w56, lactococcus lactis w58, lactobacillus acidophilus w70, bifidobacterium bifidum w23, or lactobacillus salivarius w24 or pathogenic salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis 857 at 0, 0.2, 1, 2, 10, 20, 100 or 200 bacterial cells/caco-2 cell for 1 hour. cells were also exposed to a combination of one probiotic bacterium (200 bacterial cells/caco-2 cell) and the graded numbers of salmonella as either  co-incubation (1 hour) or pre-incubation of the probiotic bacterium (1 hour) followed by salmonella (1 hour). the cells recovered for 2 or 24 hours. il-8 and  hsp70 were determined by elisa and western blot respectively. both probiotics and salmonella induced a dose- and time-dependent synthesis of il-8 but probiotics induced far lower il-8 levels than salmonella. the salmonella-induced il-8 was significantly suppressed by b. infantis w52, l. casei w56 and l. lactis w58 at low numbers of salmonella (0.2 to 20 bacterial cells/caco-2 cell) and within 2 hours of recovery. the observed probiotic-mediated reduction in il-8 secretion was transient, and lost after a few hours. in addition, these three probiotics induced a significant increase in hsp70 expression while l. acidophilus w70, b. bifidum w23 and l. salivarius w24 induced a weak hsp70 expression and could not suppress the salmonella-induced il-8 synthesis. we conclude that suppression of salmonella-induced il-8 synthesis by caco-2 cells is exhibited by probiotics that induce expression of hsp70, suggesting that the protective role of probiotics could be mediated, at least in part, via hsp70 expression. this suppression is limited to a low number of infecting pathogenic salmonella.

TI  == anti-infective mechanisms induced by a probiotic lactobacillus strain against salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium infection.
AB  == the prevention of pathogen infections is one of the most extensively studied effects of probiotics. l. casei crl 431 is a probiotic bacterium and its effects  on the gut immune cells have been extensively studied. the aim of the present study was to determine, using a mouse model, the preventive and therapeutic effect of l. casei crl 431 to achieve protection against salmonella enteritidis serovar typhimurium infection. in both previous and continuous (previous and post-infection) probiotic administration, the mechanisms induced by this lactic acid bacteria on the first line of intestinal defense (non-specific barrier and the innate immune cells associated to the gut), as a way to understand some of the mechanisms involved in the protection against salmonella enteritidis serovar  typhimurium, were analyzed. the results obtained demonstrated that 7 days l. casei crl 431 administration before infection decreased the severity of the infection with salmonella enteritidis serovar typhimurium, demonstrating that the continuous administration (even after infection) had the best effect. this continuous administration diminished the counts of the pathogen in the intestine  as well as its spread outside this organ. several mechanisms and cells are involved in this protective effect against salmonella enteritidis serovar typhimurium. l. casei crl 431 acted on cells of the innate and adaptive immune response. the probiotic administration decreased the neutrophil infiltration with the consequent diminution of intestinal inflammation; activated the macrophage phagocytic activity in different sites such as peyer's patches, spleen and peritoneum; and increased the number of iga+cells in the lamina propria of the small intestine which was correlated with increased release of s-iga specific against the pathogen in the intestinal fluids. the mechanism of the inhibition of cellular apoptosis was not involved.

TI  == adjuvant effects for oral immunization provided by recombinant lactobacillus casei secreting biologically active murine interleukin-1{beta}.
AB  == vaccine delivery systems using lactic acid bacteria are under development, but their efficiency is insufficient. autologous cytokines, such as interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), are potential adjuvants for mucosal vaccines and can be provided by recombinant lactic acid bacteria. the aim of this study was the construction and  evaluation of recombinant lactobacillus casei producing il-1beta as an adjuvant delivery agent. the recombinant strain was constructed using an expression/secretion vector plasmid, including a mature il-1beta gene from mouse. the biological activity of the cytokine was confirmed by il-8 production from caco-2 cells. in response to the recombinant l. casei secreting il-1beta, expression of il-6 was detected in vivo using a ligated-intestinal-loop assay. the release of il-6 from peyer's patch cells was also detected in vitro. intragastric immunization with heat-killed salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis (se) in combination with il-1beta-secreting lactobacilli resulted in  relatively high se-specific antibody production. in this study, it was demonstrated that recombinant l. casei secreting bioactive murine il-1beta provided adjuvant effects for intragastric immunization.

AB  == in the present study, effect of dahi containing probiotic lactobacillus casei (probiotic dahi) was evaluated to modulate immune response against salmonella enteritidis infection in mice. animals were fed with milk products along with standard diet for 2 and 7 days prior to the s. enteritidis challenge and continued on the respective dairy food-supplemented diets during the postchallenge period. translocation of s. enteritidis in spleen and liver, beta-galactosidase and beta-glucuronidase enzymatic activities and secretory iga  (siga) in intestinal fluid, lymphocyte proliferation, and cytokine (interleukin [il]-2, il-4, il-6, and interferon-gamma [ifn-gamma]) production in cultured splenocytes were assessed on day 2, 5, and 8 of the postchallenge period. colonization of s. enteritidis in liver and spleen was remarkably low in probiotic dahi-fed mice than mice fed milk and control dahi. the beta-galactosidase and beta-glucuronidase activities in intestinal fluid collected from mice prefed for 7 days with probiotic dahi were significantly lower at day 5 and 8 postchallenge than in mice fed milk and control dahi. levels of siga and lymphocyte proliferation rate were also significantly increased in probiotic dahi-fed mice compared with the other groups. production of il-2, il-6, and ifn-gamma increased, whereas il-4 decreased in splenic lymphocytes collected  from probiotic dahi-fed mice. data showed that dahi prefed for 7 days before s. enteritidis challenge was more effective than when mice were prefed for 2 days with dahi. moreover, probiotic dahi was more efficacious in protecting against s. enteritidis infection by enhancing innate and adaptive immunity than fermented milk and normal dahi. results of the present study suggest that prefeeding of probiotic dahi may strengthen the consumer's immune system and may protect infectious agents like s. enteritidis.

TI  == live and heat-inactivated lactobacilli from feces inhibit salmonella typhi and escherichia coli adherence to caco-2 cells.
AB  == a quantitative approach has been proposed to evaluate the competitive inhibition  of escherichia coli and salmonella typhi by live and heat-inactivated laboratory  isolated lactobacillus sp. on adhesion to monolayer of caco-2 cells. three species of lactobacillus (l. casei, l. acidophilus, l. agilis) isolated from human neonate feces and two commercial probiotic strains (l. casei, l. acidophilus) have been compared for probiotic activity. all lactobacilli were able to attach to the caco-2 cells, however, the degree of adhesion was bacterial strain-dependent. the adhesion indices of the two commercial probiotic strains were not significantly different from the values obtained for the other two similar fecal strains (p > 0.01). the inhibition of attachment of the pathogenic  bacteria by inactivated cells of fecal l. acidophilus was examined and compared to the results of live bacteria. the inhibition pattern was similar for live and  heat-inactivated l. acidophilus (p > 0.01). the number of attached pathogenic bacteria to the caco-2 cells decreased when the number of l. acidophilus increased from 10(6) to 10(9) cfu/ml. the heat-inactivated l. acidophilus displayed similar probiotic activity compared to the live bacteria.

TI  == dahi containing probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei has a protective effect against salmonella enteritidis infection in mice.
AB  == salmonella enteritidis infection has received attention during recent years owing to its high prevalence worldwide. in the present study, the protective effect of  probiotic dahi (curd) supplemented with lactobacillus acidophilus and l. casei against salmonella enteritidis infection in mice is investigated. seven days pre-feeding with probiotic dahi significantly increased anti-s. enteritidis siga  (secretary iga) antibodies and lymphocyte proliferation in s. enteritidis infected mice. il-2, il-6 and ifn-gamma production were significantly increased in supernatant of cultured splenocytes collected from mice pre-fed with probiotic dahi, while il-4 levels were not changed significantly. moreover, activities of beta-galactosidase and beta-glucuronidase, and counts of s. enteritidis in intestine, liver and spleen were decreased, whereas total lactobacilli in faeces  were increased in mice pre-fed with probiotic dahi. pre-feeding of probiotic dahi for 7 days was more effective than 2 days pre-feeding. thus, the results indicate that, pre-feeding with probiotic dahi ameliorated s. enteritidis infection by stimulating specific and non-specific immune response. above all, it lowered colonization of gastrointestinal tract as well as translocation of s. enteritidis.

TI  == [evaluation of the effect of lactobacillus rhamnosus probiotic culture added to yogurt over staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes and salmonella enteritidis populations].
AB  == the effect of different types of probiotics present in yogurt over known populations of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes and salmonella enteritidis was evaluated. the three types of yogurt used were: without added probiotics, with added probiotics (lactobacillus casei crl_431 and l. acidophilus crl_730 chr hansen) and another one with the same probiotics mentioned above and lactobacillus rhamnosus (lr-35) culture. about 10(9) cfu/ ml of each potentially pathogenic bacteria was added to each type of yogurt tested, and kept in refrigeration at 4 degrees c during its shelf life, about 30 days. bacterial count was done the initial day and every four days. results obtained show that there is a difference in the inhibition between yogurts without added probiotics and the commercial yogurt with added probiotics; there is a clear inhibitory effect of the last one over s. aureus, e. coli o157:h7 and listeria monocytogenes. the yogurt with added probiotics and l. rhamnosus did not show any additional inhibitory effect over the bacteria tested  when compared with the yogurt with added probiotics. s. enteritidis could not be  evaluated because it was not detectable in any yogurt samples evaluated four days after its inoculation. this study confirms the antagonic effect of probiotic cultures over potentially pathogenic bacteria for human beings and animals that may be present in food. nevertheless, the use of l. rhamnosus did not produce any additional inhibitory effect.

TI  == the lactobacillus plantarum strain aca-dc287 isolated from a greek cheese demonstrates antagonistic activity in vitro and in vivo against salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.
AB  == aims: the purpose of this study was to investigate the antibacterial activity of  the xynotyri cheese isolate lactobacillus plantarum aca-dc287 using a set of in vitro and in vivo assays. methods and results: the co-culture of l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strain sl1344 results in the killing of the pathogen. the killing activity was produced mainly  by non-lactic acid molecule(s) that were present in the cell-free culture supernatant of the l. plantarum strain aca-dc287. the culture of the l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 inhibited the penetration of s. typhimurium sl1344 into cultured human enterocyte-like caco-2/tc7 cells. in conventional mice infected with s. typhimurium sl1344, the intake of l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 results in a decrease in the levels of salmonella associated with intestinal tissues or those  present in the intestinal contents. in germ-free mice, the l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 colonized the gastrointestinal tract. conclusions: the l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 strain exerts anti-salmonella activity similar that of the established probiotic strains lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus casei shirota yit9029 and lactobacillus johnsonii la1. significance and impact of the study: the observation that a selected cheese lactobacillus strain exerted antibacterial activity that was similar to those of probiotic lactobacillus strains, is of interest for the use of this strain as an adjunct strain for the production of health-giving cheeses.

TI  == intragastric immunization with recombinant lactobacillus casei expressing flagellar antigen confers antibody-independent protective immunity against salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis.
AB  == a recombinant lactobacillus casei expressing a flagellar antigen from salmonella  enterica serovar enteritidis was constructed and evaluated as a mucosal vaccine.  intragastric immunization of the recombinant strain conferred protective immunity against salmonella infection in mice. this immunization did not result in antigen-specific antibody in either feces or sera but induced the release of ifn-gamma on restimulation of primed lymphocytes ex vivo. the results suggested that the protective efficacy provided by flagellin-expressing l. casei is mainly  attributable to cell-mediated immune responses. in addition, an adjuvant-type effect of the antigen delivery system with l. casei was also observed.

TI  == kinetic analysis of the antibacterial activity of probiotic lactobacilli towards  salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium reveals a role for lactic acid and other  inhibitory compounds.
AB  == six lactobacillus strains including commercial probiotic ones (l. acidophilus ibb 801, l. amylovorus dce 471, l. casei shirota, l. johnsonii la1, l. plantarum aca-dc 287 and l. rhamnosus gg) were investigated, through batch fermentations under controlled conditions, for their capacity to inhibit salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344. all lactobacilli displayed strong antibacterial activity toward this gram-negative pathogen and significantly inhibited invasion  of the pathogen into cultured human enterocyte-like caco-2/tc7 cells. by studying the production kinetics of antibacterial activity and applying the appropriate acid and ph control samples during a killing assay, we were able to distinguish between the effect of lactic acid and other inhibitory compounds produced. the antibacterial activity of l. acidophilus ibb 801, l. amylovorus dce 471, l. casei shirota and l. rhamnosus gg was solely due to the production of lactic acid. the  antibacterial activity of l. johnsonii la1 and l. plantarum aca-dc 287 was due to the production of lactic acid and (an) unknown inhibitory substance(s). the latter was (were) only active in the presence of lactic acid. in addition, the lactic acid produced was responsible for significant inhibitory activity upon invasion of salmonella into caco-2/tc7 cells.

TI  == ph-, lactic acid-, and non-lactic acid-dependent activities of probiotic lactobacilli against salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.
AB  == the mechanism(s) underlying the antibacterial activity of probiotic lactobacillus strains appears to be multifactorial and includes lowering of the ph and the production of lactic acid and of antibacterial compounds, including bacteriocins  and nonbacteriocin, non-lactic acid molecules. addition of dulbecco's modified eagle's minimum essential medium to the incubating medium delays the killing activity of lactic acid. we found that the probiotic strains lactobacillus johnsonii la1, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus casei shirota yit9029, l. casei dn-114 001, and l. rhamnosus gr1 induced a dramatic decrease in the viability of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344 mainly attributable to non-lactic acid molecule(s) present in the cell-free culture supernatant (cfcs). these molecules were more active against serovar typhimurium sl1344 in the exponential growth phase than in the stationary growth phase. we also showed  that the production of the non-lactic acid substance(s) responsible for the killing activity was dependent on growth temperature and that both unstable and stable substances with killing activity were present in the cfcss. we found that  the complete inhibition of serovar typhimurium sl1344 growth results from a ph-lowering effect.

TI  == the effect of probiotic bacteria on the adhesion of pathogens to human intestinal mucus.
AB  == human intestinal glycoproteins extracted from faeces were used as a model for intestinal mucus to investigate adhesion of pathogenic escherichia coli and salmonella strains, and the effect of probiotics on this adhesion. s-fimbriated e. coli expressed relatively high adhesion in the mucus model, but the other tested pathogens adhered less effectively. probiotic strains lactobacillus gg and l. rhamnosus lc-705 as well as a l. rhamnosus isolated from human faeces were able to slightly reduce s-fimbria-mediated adhesion. adhesion of s. typhimurium was significantly inhibited by probiotic l. johnsonii lj1 and l. casei shirota. lactobacillus gg and l. rhamnosus (human isolate) increased the adhesion of s. typhimurium suggesting that the pathogen interacts with the probiotic.

TI  == antibacterial activity of lactobacillus species against vibrio species.
AB  == forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.

TI  == antagonistic activity exerted in vitro and in vivo by lactobacillus casei (strain gg) against salmonella typhimurium c5 infection.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the antagonistic properties of lactobacillus casei gg exerted in vitro against salmonella typhimurium c5 in a cellular model,  cultured enterocyte-like caco-2 cells, to those exerted in vivo in an animal model, c3h/he/oujco mice. our results show that a 1-h contact between the invading strain c5 and either the culture or the supernatant of l. casei gg impeded the invasion by the salmonella strain in caco-2 cells, without modifying  the viability of the strain. after neutralization at ph 7, no inhibition of the invasion by c5 was observed. the antagonistic activity of l. casei gg was examined in c3h/he/oujco mice orally infected with c5 as follows: (i) l. casei gg was given daily to conventional animals as a probiotic, and (ii) it was given once to germ-free animals in order to study the effect of the population of l. casei gg established in the different segments of the gut. in vivo experiments show that after a single challenge with c5, this strain survives and persists at  a higher level in the feces of the untreated conventional mice than in those of the treated group. in l. casei gg germ-free mice, establishment of l. casei gg in the gut significantly delayed the occurrence of 100% mortality of the animals (15 days after c5 challenge versus 9 days in germ-free mice [p < 0.01]). cecal colonization level and translocation rate of c5 to the mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, and liver were significantly reduced during the first 2 days post-c5 challenge, although the l. casei gg population level in the gut dramatically decreased in these animals.

TI  == distribution of an l-isoaspartyl protein methyltransferase in eubacteria.
AB  == a protein carboxyl methyltransferase (ec 2.1.1.77) that recognizes age-damaged proteins for potential repair or degradation reactions has been found in all vertebrate tissues and cells examined to date. this enzyme catalyzes the transfer of methyl groups from s-adenosylmethionine to the carboxyl groups of d-aspartyl or l-isoaspartyl residues that are formed spontaneously from normal l-aspartyl and l-asparaginyl residues. a similar methyltransferase has been found in two bacterial species, escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium, suggesting that this enzyme performs an essential function in all cells. in this study, we show that this enzyme is present in cytosolic extracts of six additional members of the alpha and gamma subdivisions of the purple bacteria: pseudomonas aeruginosa (gamma), rhodobacter sphaeroides (alpha), and the gamma enteric species klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens. dna probes from the e. coli methyltransferase gene hybridized only to the chromosomal dna of the enteric species. interestingly, no activity was found  in the plant pathogen erwinia chrysanthemi, a member of the enteric family, nor in rhizobium meliloti or rhodopseudomonas palustris, two members of the alpha subdivision. additionally, we could not detect activity in the four gram-positive species bacillus subtilis, b. stearothermophilus, lactobacillus casei, and streptomyces griseus. the absence of enzyme activity was not due to the presence  of inhibitors in the extracts. these results suggest that many cells may not have the enzymatic machinery to recognize abnormal aspartyl residues by methylation reactions. since the nonenzymatic degradation reactions that generate these residues occur in all cells, other pathways may be present in nature to ensure that these types of altered proteins do not accumulate and interfere with normal  cellular physiology.

TI  == immunoadjuvant activity of oral lactobacillus casei: influence of dose on the secretory immune response and protective capacity in intestinal infections.
AB  == lactobacilli, often used as effectors of host functions, could play an important  role in maintaining human health by controlling other intestinal microorganisms capable of producing harmful effects. using an experimental model, we studied the effect of different oral doses of lactobacillus casei on the secretory iga response and the protective capacity of the microorganism in preventing intestinal infections. the optimization of the protective dose of lb. casei by previous feeding and the use of the lactobacillus as an immunological way to control enteric infections were investigated. we found that conventional mice were protected against infection with salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli by previous feeding for 2 consecutive days with a daily lb. casei dose of 1.2 x 10(9) cfu/mouse. previous feeding for 7 d proved less effective, and feeding for  5 d afforded no protection at all. we were also able to demonstrate that the protective effect of lb. casei against sal. typhimurium and esch. coli was connected mainly with the high level of iga antipathogen antibodies present in intestinal secretions. beta-glucuronidase (ec 3.2.1.31) and beta-galactosidase (ec 3.2.1.23) activities, measured both in the intestinal fluid and histological  samples, showed a marked increase in intestinal inflammatory response on day 5 of feeding. these results show that lb. casei plays an important role in the prevention of enteric infections, a low dose being enough for protection against  intestinal infections by increasing iga secretion into the intestinal lumen, thus providing adequate defences for the mucosal surface. a previously administered dose of this magnitude could therefore be used as an oral adjuvant in preventing  enteric infections.

TI  == prevention of gastrointestinal infection using immunobiological methods with milk fermented with lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == the protective effect of feeding milk fermented with a mixture of lactobacillus casei sp. and lb. acidophilus sp. against salmonella typhimurium infection in mice was compared with that obtained feeding milks fermented with these microorganisms individually. the survival rate obtained after oral infection with sal. typhimurium was 100% in mice pretreated by feeding during 8 d with the mixture of lb. casei and lb. acidophilus fermented milks. similar treatments with the individual milks were ineffective. moreover, mice became more susceptible to  infection with sal. typhimurium after such treatment. the colonization of liver and spleen with the pathogen was markedly inhibited by the pretreatment with the  mixture of fermented milk, while such inhibition was not observed using the lb. casei and lb. acidophilus milks. the highest levels of anti-salmonellae antibodies in serum and in intestinal fluid were found in the group of mice fed with the mixture and with lb. casei fermented milk respectively. however, this latter milk was not effective in protecting against sal. typhimurium. when the mice were first infected with sal. typhimurium and then fed with the mixture of fermented milks, pathogen colonization was not prevented. the results suggest that the augmentation of resistance to salmonellae caused by the treatment with lb. casei- + lb. acidophilus-fermented milk was due to the anti-salmonellae protective immunity mainly mediated by the mucosal tissue. milk fermented with this mixture could be used as an immunobiological method to prevent gastrointestinal infection.
