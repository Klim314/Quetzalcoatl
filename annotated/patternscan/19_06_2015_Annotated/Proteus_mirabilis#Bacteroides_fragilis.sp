TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == fournier's gangrene: ten-year experience in a medical center in northern taiwan.
AB  == background and purpose: fournier's gangrene is a life-threatening infection. the  mortality is still high despite the rapid advancement of modern intensive care and surgical technique. in this study, we present our institution's recent experience with a large series of patients with fournier's gangrene. methods: a retrospective chart review was performed including 44 consecutive patients with fournier's gangrene over a 10-year period. results: the 44 cases comprised 39 males and 5 females, with a mean age of 55.5 years. the mean duration of hospitalization was 27.9 days. overall mortality was 22.7%. diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic liver disease, liver cirrhosis and chronic renal insufficiency were the 5 leading predisposing factors. liver cirrhosis was highly related to mortality (p=0.009). the etiologic origin of the gangrene was colorectal, urological and dermatological in 52.3%, 25.0%, and 11.4% of patients, respectively. the most common isolated pathogens were escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus spp., and proteus mirabilis. there were a total of 74 debridements. other related surgical procedures were reconstruction surgery (n = 18), colostomy (2), cystostomy (1), vasectomy (1), orchiectomy (1) and penectomy (1). major complications of fournier's gangrene, including respiratory failure, renal failure, septic shock,  hepatic failure and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, were significantly to mortality (p<0.05). conclusions: early diagnosis, intensive medical care (aggressive resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics), and prompt and repeated surgical intervention are the mainstays of treatment. liver cirrhosis in particular is a poor prognostic factor. reconstructive surgery should also be a consideration once the acute condition has improved. patients with comorbid condition, serious infection, and major complications should be treated carefully and aggressively.

TI  == bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  == treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. it is active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. the aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella ozaenae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers  and non-producers). gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic bacteroides fragilis. ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs). killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the  first few hours of the kinetic curves against e. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (cfu) reduction in the first 2h), b. fragilis (4 log(10) cfu reduction in 4h), mssa (3 log(10) cfu reduction in 4-6h), k. ozaenae (esbl+), k. pneumoniae (esbl+ and -), e. cloacae (esbl-) in 1h and p. mirabilis (esbl+) in the first 2h. the potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of e. coli-b. fragilis and e. coli-b. fragilis-e. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of s. aureus-p. mirabilis. these results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == in vitro activities of tigecycline, ertapenem, isepamicin, and other antimicrobial agents against clinically isolated organisms in taiwan.
AB  == this study evaluated the in vitro activities of tigecycline, ertapenem, isepamicin, and other comparators against 861 bacterial isolates recovered from patients treated in three major teaching hospitals in 2003. mics to antimicrobial agents were determined by the agar dilution method. high rates of oxacillin resistance (58%) in staphylococcus aureus (60 isolates), and vancomycin resistance (21%) and quinupristin-dalfopristin non-susceptibility (39%) in enterococcus faecium (34 isolates) were found. carbapenems had excellent in vitro activities (>or=98% susceptibility) against the 419 isolates of enterobacteriaceae, with the mic(50) and mic(90) of imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem being 0.25 and 4 mg/l, 0.03 and 0.12 mg/l, and 0.03 and 0.5 mg/l, respectively. for, pseudomonas aeruginosa (74 isolates) and burkholderia cepacia  (21 isolates), meropenem (mic(90), 0.25, 2, and 4 mg/l, respectively) had better  in vitro activities than imipenem (mic(90), 8, 4, and 32 mg/l, respectively) and  ertapenem (mic(90), 0.5, >32, and 32 mg/l, respectively). isepamicin had a similar activity with amikacin against all enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, b. cepacia, and acinetobacter baumannii, except for c. freundii isolates in which isepamicin had an eight-fold activity better than amikacin. tigecycline had excellent in vitro activities against all isolates tested (mic(90), <or=1 mg/l) including 14 pandrugresistant a. baumannii isolates (mics,  1-4 mg/l), except for proteus mirabilis (59 isolates; mic(90), 8 mg/l), bacteroides fragilis (60 isolates; mic(90), 8 mg/l), p. aeruginosa (mic(90), 16 mg/l), and b. cepacia (21 isolates; mic(90), 16 mg/l). tigecycline, carbapenems,  and isepamicin exhibited better or comparable in vitro activities against a wide  spectrum of commonly encountered bacteria than other comparator antimicrobials and may represent therapeutic options for infections due to multidrug-resistant pathogens.

TI  == metabolic activation of bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene, 4-aminobiphenyl, and benzidine by pseudomonas aeruginosa and other human endogenous bacteria.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen of the human urinary tract, and other selected human endogenous bacteria were investigated for metabolic activation of the bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene (2-af), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ab), and benzidine (bz). the cell-free extracts of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, klebsiella pneumoniae,  and intestinal anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and eubacterium aerofaciens produced increased histidine revertant frequencies with the tester strain salmonella typhimurium ta98 in the ames salmonella mutagenicity assay. in addition, the cell-free extracts of pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, and eubacterium aerofaciens each showed the presence of a cytochrome p450 absorption peak in the carbon monoxide (co) difference spectrum. this was not demonstratable for the other bacteria. our findings indicate that human endogenous bacteria, which are opportunistic pathogens of the urinary bladder, can metabolically activate the bladder procarcinogens 2-af, 4-ab, and bz into mutagens. the metabolic activation by pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, and eubacterium aerofaciens is mediated by a cytochrome p450 enzyme. for those organisms that induced metabolic activation but did not show a p450 absorption peak with the cell-free extracts, other oxidative enzymes may be involved.

TI  == identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of micro-organisms recovered from cutaneous lesions of human american tegumentary leishmaniasis in minas gerais, brazil.
AB  == an evaluation of the microbiota present in cutaneous ulcers from 31 patients with a clinical and parasitological diagnosis of american tegumentary leishmaniasis (atl) was carried out by the standard filter paper disc technique, including antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacterial isolates. microbial examination indicated that 21 patients (67.7%) were contaminated with one to four bacteria and some of them also with yeast. a total of 142 micro-organisms were isolated. staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently recovered bacterium (95.2% of positive patients) and was found to produce type b (70% of the staphylococcal isolates) and type c (50%) enterotoxins as well as toxic shock syndrome toxin (60%). proteus mirabilis (33.3% of the positive patients), streptococcus pyogenes (19.0 %), h(2)s-negative proteus species (19.0%), klebsiella oxytoca (14.3%), enterobacter species (9.5%), peptostreptococcus species (9.5%), pseudomonas species (4.8%), prevotella bivia (4.8%), escherichia coli (4.8%), streptococcus agalactiae (4.8%), bacteroides fragilis (4.8%), candida albicans (9.5%) and candida tropicalis (4.8%) were also isolated. surprisingly, staph. aureus isolates were susceptible to almost all tested drugs, although some of them were  resistant to penicillin (69%) and ampicillin + sulbactam (68%). concerning obligate anaerobes, all the gram-negative isolates (25% of the total) were resistant to metronidazole. the results of the present study show that microbial  secondary contaminants, particularly staph. aureus, should be considered in the diagnosis and treatment of atl lesions.

TI  == [surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2003].
AB  == for the post-marketing surveillance of cefmetazole (cmz, cefmetazon), mics of injectable beta-lactam antibacterials including cmz against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over japan are measured yearly and the incidence rates of resistance in various species are also evaluated. in the first surveillance from june 2000 to march 2001, 574 isolates of 13 species were tested, 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from april 2001 to march 2002, and 654 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the third surveillance from april 2002 to march 2003. no remarkable changes in the activity of cmz were observed in these surveillances spanning three years. the activity of cmz in this study was comparable to that in the studies conducted before cefmetazon was launched. this result suggests that cmz still maintains potent activity. changes in percent resistance of each species to cmz (mic of cmz > or = 32 microg/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa, 0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, 72.9% --> 87.2% --> 88.7%), staphylococcus epidermidis (18.5% --> 31.6% --> 14.3%), coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. (cns, 13.3% --> 18.2% --> 21.4%), escherichia coli (3.6% -->  0.8% --> 2.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4% --> 3.8% --> 2.1%), klebsiella oxytoca (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), proteus mirabilis (2.3% --> 2.1% --> 0.0%), proteus vulgaris (13.6% --> 6.7% --> 0.0%), morganella morganii (7.3% --> 0.0% --> 14.0%), providencia spp. (12.5% --> 0.0% --> 18.2%), peptostreptococcus spp.  (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), bacteroides fragilis (10.3% --> 10.8% --> 17.1%), bacteroides spp. (78.6% --> 87.5% --> 62.5%). the change in percent resistance of mrsa, other cns, and b. flagiris tended to increase. it is necessary to pay much  attention to trends observed in these species. compared to other drugs tested, against mssa, the activity of cmz was inferior to that of cez, ctm, and fmox and  superior to that sbt/cpz. against mrsa, s. epidermidis, and cns, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and inferior to that of fmox. against b. flagiris and other bacteroides spp., the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and comparable to or inferior to that of sbt/cpz and fmox.

TI  == bacteriological study of diabetic foot infections.
AB  == aims: the polymicrobial nature of diabetic foot infection has been well documented in the literature. patients with diabetic foot infection not exposed to antibiotics are not well studied before. the relative frequency of bacterial isolates cultured from community-acquired foot infections that are not exposed to antimicrobial agents for 30 days is studied. in addition, the bacterial comparative in vitro susceptibility to the commonly used antibacterial agents is  assessed. methods: this is a prospective study in which the infected wounds of 86 consecutive diabetic patients seen in the diabetic foot clinic in adan teaching hospital were cultured when visiting the clinic. the patients did not receive antimicrobial therapy 30 days prior to taking the cultures. the specimen was cultured using aerobic and anaerobic microbiological techniques. isolates were tested for susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial therapy. result: staphylococcus aureus was the most common isolate, being recovered from 38.4% of  cases. other organisms were pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.5%) and proteus mirabilis  (18%), anaerobic gram-negative organisms (10.5%), mainly bacteroides fragilis. imipenem, meropenem, and cefepime were the most effective agents against gram-negative organisms. vancomycin was the most effective against gram-positive  organisms. conclusion: s. aureus and p. aeruginosa were the most common causes of diabetic foot infections. anaerobic organisms are still a common cause for infection, although the prevalence is less. these wounds may require use of combined antimicrobial therapy for initial management.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

TI  == evaluation of a new etest for detecting metallo-beta-lactamases in routine clinical testing.
AB  == several etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) gradient formats were developed for detection of metallo-beta-lactamases based on the reduction of imipenem (ip) or ceftazidime (tz) mics in the presence of edta or 2-mercaptopropionic acid (mpa).  the etest metallo-beta-lactamase (etest mbl) strips consisted of a double-sided seven-dilution range of ip or tz (4 to 256 microg/ml) and ip or tz (1 to 64 microg/ml) overlaid with a constant concentration of edta or mpa. the prototype strips were evaluated on several agar media (brain heart infusion agar, isosensitest agar, nutrient agar, and mueller-hinton agar for aerobes and brucella blood agar for anaerobes) with 138 challenge strains: acinetobacter spp. (n = 9), aeromonas spp. (n = 8), chryseobacterium spp. (n = 28), escherichia coli (n = 1), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 14), proteus  mirabilis (n = 3), serratia spp. (n = 10), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 43), sphingobacterium spp. (n = 3), and bacteroides fragilis group (n = 15). pcr analysis using specific primers for imp-1, l1, ccra, and bla(b/c) confirmed the presence of the metallo-beta-lactamase genes. enzyme assays were also performed with ip as an indicator substrate followed by edta inhibition profiles. edta was  found to be a better inhibitor of metallo-beta-lactamases, especially for anaerobes. ip was a better than tz. mueller-hinton agar was the preferred medium, particularly when compared to isosensitest agar, which frequently produced falsely low mics for ip. etest ip plus ip-edta with mueller-hinton agar had a sensitivity of 94% (79 of 84) and specificity of 95% (124 of 130). the etest mbl  strip appears to be an acceptable diagnostic reagent to detect metallo-beta-lactamase phenotypes in the clinical microbiology laboratory.

(b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lowffii throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae  yearly obviously increased with approximately 65-time difference during study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained  the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however,  the decrease in the antibacterial activity of czop against h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. changes in czop susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), escherichia coli (n = 276), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), enterobacter  aerogenes (n = 93), serratia marcescens (n = 172), serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), citrobacter freundii (n = 177), citrobacter koseri (n = 70), proteus mirabilis (n = 113), proteus vulgaris (n = 89), morganella morganii (n = 116), providencia spp. (n = 41), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), pseudomonas putida (n = 63), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and prevotella/porphyromonas (n = 173). an antibacterial activity of czop against e.  coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and s. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against m.(b.) catarrhalis, c. koseri, and p. aeruginosa  was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and p. mirabilis increased year by year. the increase in mic90 of czop against e. aerogenes and p. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. in contract, the susceptibility of e. cloacae  to czop was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to czop. mic90 of czop against c. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. additionally, mic90 of czop against h. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little  higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. an antibacterial activity of czop against p. fluorescens, p. putida, b. cepacia, s.  maltophilia, b. fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. changes in mic90 of czop against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.

TI  == in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against local bacterial isolates.
AB  == introduction: the emergence of resistance to common antimicrobials in bacteria has been increasingly reported in various countries. empirical antimicrobial therapy of various infections would therefore need to be reviewed. the introduction of new fluoroquinolones has created an interest in the use of these  as possible agents in the empirical treatment of respiratory tract infections. materials and methods: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the new fluoroquinolone, moxifloxacin, against 400 clinical bacterial isolates was determined by the e-test method. results: all streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (penicillin sensitive or resistant) were susceptible to moxifloxacin. similarly,  both beta-lactamase and non beta-lactamase producing haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis isolates were susceptible to moxifloxacin. as for enterobacteriaceae, 88.6% of the isolates tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin with mic < 8 mg/l, but resistance was noted for some of proteus mirabilis, klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli. enterococci and acinetobacter baumannii were resistant to moxifloxacin, whilst the anaerobes tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin. conclusion: moxifloxacin has good in vitro activity against common  organisms associated with community and nosocomial infections, with the exception of enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria. there was good anti-anaerobic activity against bacteroides fragilis and clostridum spp. results of this study are consistent with other similar published in vitro studies.

TI  == bacteriology of diabetic foot.
AB  == objectives: to study the relative frequency of bacterial isolates cultured from diabetic foot infections and assess their comparative in vitro susceptibility to  the commonly used antibacterial agents. methods: this is a retrospective study with a review of the bacteriology results of specimens taken from 111 consecutive patients with diabetic foot infections at king abdulaziz university hospital, jeddah, kingdom of saudi arabia, during the period january 1997 to june 1999. the specimens were cultured using optimal aerobic and anaerobic microbiologic techniques. antimicrobial susceptibility testing to different agents, was carried out using the disc diffusion method. results: staphylococcus aureus was the commonest isolate being recovered from 28% of cases, including methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus in 9 of 30 (30%) patient wounds. the other organisms isolated were pseudomonas aeruginosa (22%) and proteus mirabilis (18%), anaerobic gram-negative organisms (11%) mainly bacteroides fragilis. the antimicrobial susceptibility testing, showed that vancomycin was the most effective against gram-positive and and imipenem was the most effective against gram-negative organisms. conclusion: staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and bacteroides fragilis were the most common causes of diabetic foot infections. these wounds require use of combined antimicrobial therapy for initial patient management prior to susceptibility results.

TI  == sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  == the microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). there were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and  12 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). the predominant anaerobes were prevotella sp.  (5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

TI  == the periplasmic, group iii catalase of vibrio fischeri is required for normal symbiotic competence and is induced both by oxidative stress and by approach to stationary phase.
AB  == the catalase gene, kata, of the sepiolid squid symbiont vibrio fischeri has been  cloned and sequenced. the predicted amino acid sequence of kata has a high degree of similarity to the recently defined group iii catalases, including those found  in haemophilus influenzae, bacteroides fragilis, and proteus mirabilis. upstream  of the predicted start codon of kata is a sequence that closely matches the consensus sequence for promoters regulated in escherichia coli by the alternative sigma factor encoded by rpos. further, the level of expression of the cloned kata gene in an e. coli rpos mutant is much lower than in wild-type e. coli. catalase  activity is induced three- to fourfold both as growing v. fischeri cells approach stationary phase and upon the addition of a small amount of hydrogen peroxide during logarithmic growth. the catalase activity was localized in the periplasm of wild-type v. fischeri cells, where its role could be to detoxify hydrogen peroxide coming from the external environment. no significant catalase activity could be detected in a kata null mutant strain, demonstrating that kata is the predominately expressed catalase in v. fischeri and indicating that v. fischeri carries only a single catalase gene. the catalase mutant was defective in its ability to competitively colonize the light organs of juvenile squids in coinoculation experiments with the parent strain, suggesting that the catalase enzyme plays an important role in the symbiosis between v. fischeri and its squid host.

AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to report the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of periumbilical necrotizing fasciitis in newborn infants. study design: retrospective review was done of the author's 20-year experience. results: specimens obtained from 11 newborn infants with periumbilical necrotizing fasciitis were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. a total of 38 bacterial isolates was recovered: 21 aerobic and facultative and 17 anaerobic. aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 1 specimen (9%),  anaerobes only in 2 (18%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora in 8 (73%). multiple organisms were recovered from all instances and the number of isolates varied from two to six (average 3.5 isolates per specimen). the predominant isolates were peptostreptococcus sp. (7 isolates); bacteroides fragilis group (6); streptococcus group b (4); and staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus group d, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis (3 each). all patients underwent extensive debridement and resection, and they received supportive and antimicrobial therapy. six (55%) of the patients died. conclusions: these findings illustrate the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora of periumbilical necrotizing fasciitis.

TI  == the effect of the bacterial product, succinic acid, on neutrophil bactericidal activity.
AB  == we investigated the effect of succinic acid on neutrophil bactericidal activity in a model of intra-abdominal abscess induced in mice by the peritoneal inoculation of 5 x 10(6) cfu ml-1 e. coli and 5 x 10(8) cfu ml-1 b. fragilis plus 1 mg of bran as faecal fibre analogue. the mean ph of the induced abscesses at week 1 was 6.7, higher than the ph associated with succinic acid inhibitory activity. we therefore determined the effect of succinic acid (0-100 mm) at ph 6.7 on the bactericidal activity of mouse bone marrow-derived neutrophils. phagocytic killing of proteus mirabilis by neutrophils was significantly inhibited by 30-100 mm succinic acid at ph 6.7 but there was no significant effect of succinic acid on engulfment of bacteria at this ph. however, significant inhibition of intracellular killing (assayed by adding succinic acid  to suspensions of neutrophils which had engulfed bacteria in low serum concentrations but in the absence of succinic acid) was noted at 70 and 100 mm. these results indicate that succinic acid inhibits neutrophil bactericidal activity at a physiological ph, principally through inhibition of intracellular killing mechanisms and therefore contributing to bacterial persistence in this model of abscess formation.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against clinical isolates].
AB  == in order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefodizime (cdzm), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cdzm and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates collected from nation-wide medical institutions and in  our laboratory from september to december of 1992 and from september to december  of 1995. the results are summarized as follows: 1. bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to cdzm included streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis and neisseria gonorrhoeae. the  range of mic values of cdzm against klebsiella pneumoniae was spread. other strains, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., peptostreptococcus spp.  and bacteroides fragilis group were resistant to cephems including cdzm. 2. the mic90's of cdzm were 0.05 approximately 3.13 micrograms/ml against streptococcus  spp., h. influenzae, m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, klebsiella spp., p. mirabilis, n. gonorrhoeae and peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently  found in daily treatment of infections. it appears that the effectiveness of cdzm was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. among h. influenzae isolates included imipenem (ipm)-resistant and norfloxacin (nflx)-resistant strains. the mic-range of cdzm against strains collected in 1995 including ipm-resistant and nflx-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and mic90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. cdzm showed strong antimicrobial activities against h. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.

TI  == sonographically guided aspiration: an alternative therapy for tubo-ovarian abscess.
AB  == our objective was to evaluate the role of single-step ultrasound-guided aspiration in conjunction with intracavitary antibiotic instillation for the treatment of tubo-ovarian abscess. ten women with the clinical and sonographic diagnosis of tubo-ovarian abscess, who failed to respond to systemic antibiotic therapy, were treated by ultrasound-guided aspiration of the abscess followed by  intracavitary instillation of a combination of antibiotics. all ten women improved clinically and none required surgery. the mean time from aspiration to hospital discharge was 3.1 days with mean duration of hospitalization 7.8 days. no major complications were observed. the average time interval between aspiration of the lesion and resolution on sonographic follow-up was 9.5 weeks. in three cases, pelvic inflammatory disease recurred, but none needed surgical intervention. the average follow-up period of the patients was 12 months. one-step sonographically guided aspiration of tubo-ovarian abscess followed by intracavitary antibiotic instillation may serve as an easy and safe alternative therapy in patients in whom treatment with systemic antibiotics has failed.

TI  == an evaluation of the in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam.
AB  == tazobactam is a new, irreversible inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases of staphylococci, plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of the tem and shv types found in escherichia coli and klebsiella species and beta-lactamases of anerobes such as bacteroides species. its combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum ureido-penicillin, would be expected to improve the activity of piperacillin against staphylococci, tem and shv beta-lactamase producing gram negative bacteria and anerobes. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of piperacillin/tazobactam were determined for 1952 individual patient isolates of gram positive and negative bacteria causing significant infections and compared with mic values for cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid. mics were determined by agar dilution (nccls 1990 and 1992). piperacillin/tazobactam had excellent activity against methicillin susceptible staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, enterococci and organisms of the bacteroides fragilis group. it was also active against the majority of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates tested. it was not active against extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producing klebsiella species and some high level tem and shv beta-lactamase producing e. coli and klebsiella species. activity against gram negative organisms capable of producing chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases was good, since in most organisms tested, the enzymes were not induced in sufficient quantities to cause antibiotic resistance. however some enterobacter species were derepressed hyperproducing mutants; these isolates showed resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam since tazobactam does not inhibit these class i beta lactamases. activity was superior to ticarcillin/clavulanic acid for gram negative rods. imipenem was the most active agent against esbl producing klebsiella species. piperacillin/tazobactam has a suitable spectrum of activity in vitro to suggest its use in monotherapy of mixed anerobic infections, mixed respiratory infections such as aspiration pneumonia and, in combination with an aminoglycoside, it would provide gram positive as well as gram negative cover of  febrile episodes in immunosuppressed patients.

TI  == bacteroides fragilis enterotoxin modulates epithelial permeability and bacterial  internalization by ht-29 enterocytes.
AB  == background & aims: enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis has been associated with  diarrheal disease, and the enterotoxin has a cytopathic effect on cultured ht-29  enterocytes. experiments were designed to determine the effect of b. fragilis enterotoxin on bacteria-enterocyte interactions. methods: confluent ht-29 enterocytes were incubated for 1 hour with b. fragilis enterotoxin, followed by 1 hour of incubation with pure cultures of enteric bacteria, namely, salmonella typhimurium (two strains), listeria monocytogenes (three strains), proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli (three strains), and enterococcus faecalis. enterocyte viability was assessed using vital dyes, epithelial permeability was measured using transepithelial electrical resistance, enterocyte morphology and bacteria-enterocyte interactions were visualized using light and electron microscopy, and bacterial internalization was assessed using a quantitative culture of lysed enterocytes. results: b. fragilis enterotoxin did not affect enterocyte viability but decreased transepithelial electrical resistance, and individual enterocytes pulled apart. enterotoxin pretreatment decreased internalization of l. monocytogenes (p < 0.01) but increased (p < 0.01) internalization of the other strains of enteric bacteria. augmented bacterial internalization was associated with preferential bacterial adherence on the exposed lateral surface of enterotoxin-treated enterocytes. conclusions: b. fragilis enterotoxin was associated with ht-29 cell rounding and with augmented internalization of selected strains of enteric bacteria that were preferentially  adherent on the exposed enterocyte lateral surface.

TI  == the features and aetiology of fournier's gangrene.
AB  == this paper reports a clinical study of 20 cases of gangrenous ulcers of the scrotum and/or of the penis (fournier's gangrene) and a review of previous publications. even though found mostly in elderly male patients, the disease spares no age group and can involve the external genitalia in neonates and women  as well. the disease is a necrotising fasciitis of infective origin and always has a portal of entry of the infecting organisms even though it may be so trivial as to be undetected. the commonest portals of entry of infection are periurethral sepsis, groin wound sepsis, anorectal sepsis, prostatic sepsis and trauma. the infecting organisms comprise both aerobic and anaerobic organisms such as escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, proteus mirabilis, enterococci, bacteroides fragilis and anaerobic streptococcus. fournier's gangrene is probably the same disease as necrotizing fasciitis occurring in other parts of the body, but modified by the peculiar anatomy of the genitoperineum.

TI  == effect of different combinations of antibiotics on experimental septic peritonitis in rabbits.
AB  == this study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of different combinations of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of experimental septic peritonitis. two hundred rabbits, divided into ten groups of 20 rabbits each, were used. septic peritonitis was provoked in two stages: treatment of animals by mechanical lavage or antibiotics was performed during the first stage; blood cultures, isolation and identification of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the peritoneal cavity were performed during the second stage. the parameters assessed were survival and, in the second phase, the formation of peritoneal abscesses. the most significant finding was noted in the first phase, where diffuse peritonitis took  place, with a very high mortality rate due to bacteremia and sepsis. in both blood and pus from the peritoneal cavity cultures in all groups, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis (among the aerobes) and bacteroides fragilis, clostridium sp. and peptostreptococcus sp. (among anaerobes) were the predominant pathogens identified. high mortality rates appeared to be due to the aerobic microbes, particularly escherichia coli, whereas abscess formation was related to the anaerobes, particularly bacteroides  fragilis. all antibiotics tested were effective, whether alone or in combination. metronidazole, however, was the most effective in the reduction of intraabdominal abscesses. the lowest mortality rate was observed in animals injected with piperacillin and a combination of cefoxitin and an aminoglycoside with metronidazole. finally, good peritoneal lavage seemed to be as effective as any combination of antibiotic treatment.

AB  == the in vitro activity of nine fluoroquinolones, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, fleroxacin and levofloxacin, and two earlier quinolones, nalidixic acid and pipemidic acid, against 1,346 bacterial strains isolated clinically between 1989 and 1990, was evaluated by agar dilution method. the bacteria studied were staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains), staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus species (including high-level gentamicin-resistant strains), escherichia coli, salmonella species, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and bacteroides fragilis. in contrast to the moderate to poor activity of two earlier quinolones, the fluoroquinolones acted well against most enterobacteriaceae and a. baumannii. the minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the drug strains (mic90s) were < 1 microgram/ml against most tested species. ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin  were more effective against multi-drug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. all fluoroquinolones assayed were very active against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, with mic90s < or = 1 microgram/ml. for methicillin-resistant strains, on  the other hand, the mic90s were > or = 4 micrograms/ml. there was no significant  difference in fluoroquinolone susceptibility between methicillin-susceptible and  -resistant s. epidermidis. sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more active against enterococci. most fluoroquinolones were relatively inactive against b. fragilis, with the exception of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin. the mic90s of most quinolones assayed against k. pneumoniae, citrobacter spp., e. cloacae, s. aureus and s. epidermidis were at least four-fold higher in our study. therefore, it is important for physicians to use fluoroquinolones carefully so as to prevent or delay the emergence of resistant strains.

TI  == the effect of cytokines on bactericidal activity of murine neutrophils.
AB  == a range of recombinant cytokines have now been shown to modify aspects of the phenotype and function of human and murine neutrophils. however, few reports describe modification of the bactericidal activity of neutrophils. we therefore examined the recombinant murine cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha, 10-1000 ng ml-1) and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (gm-csf, 10-1000 u ml-1) for their ability to increase the bacterial killing capacity of murine neutrophils. neutrophils from either bone marrow (fresh or cultured), or peritoneal exudates, or abscesses, were pre-incubated with either cytokine for 30-60 min and the killing of proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, or bacteroides  fragilis was examined in the presence or absence of serum over a 90 min period. only for one combination was a small but significantly enhanced level of bacterial killing observed, the phagocytic killing of p. mirabilis by peritoneal  exudate neutrophils in the presence of gm-csf and serum. with this exception there was no enhancement of bacterial killing for the range of combinations of neutrophils and bacterial species tested. in contrast, at the concentrations tested for effect on bactericidal activity, tnf-alpha and gm-csf were able to significantly upregulate cr3 (but not fc gamma rii) expression on mouse neutrophils. these results indicate that upregulation of cr3 as an index of neutrophil activation does not necessarily correlate with increased bactericidal  activity.

TI  == oral infectivity and bacterial interactions with mononuclear phagocytes.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to clarify the association between the oral infectivity of a bacterial strain and its susceptibility to ingestion by mononuclear phagocytes or ability to survive within them. ten bacterial strains tested--all of known oral infectivity--comprised salmonella typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes (three strains), escherichia coli (two strains), proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, and a bacteroides sp. the phagocytic uptake of each strain was measured as the bacteria to phagocyte ratio after mononuclear phagocytes in mouse peritoneal exudate were permitted to ingest bacteria in vivo for 3 min. the three listeria strains were the most susceptible  to phagocytic uptake and the salmonella strain was relatively resistant. the intracellular survival of each strain was studied during a subsequent 2 h in-vitro incubation of the mononuclear phagocytes that had been permitted to ingest bacteria in vivo. the strains with the best intracellular survival were ent. faecalis and two of the three listeria strains. the ability of s. typhimurium to survive intracellularly was intermediate but better than that of the two e. coli strains. oral infectivity was not consistently correlated with susceptibility to ingestion by mononuclear phagocytes or ability to survive within them.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of biapenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic.
AB  == biapenem is a new carbapenem antibiotic with high stability to human renal dehydropeptidase i. its in vitro activity was compared with that of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, piperacillin and gentamicin against a total  of 650 recent clinical isolates. mics were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and all isolates were tested at two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu). biapenem inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus  mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia stuartii, enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, shigella sonnei and yersinia enterocolitica at < or = 2 mg/l and was as active as or two- to four-fold more active than imipenem against all these species, with the exception of serratia marcescens, against which imipenem was two-fold more active. biapenem was two-fold more active than imipenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 4 mg/l) and had activity similar to that of imipenem against the bacteroides fragilis group (mic90 0.5 mg/l) but was two-fold less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90 0.06 mg/l)  and was, like imipenem, inactive against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == gram-negative enteric bacillary meningitis: a twenty-one-year experience.
AB  == we reviewed our experience with gram-negative enteric bacillary meningitis in neonates and infants from 1969 through 1989. ninety-eight patients were identified. their ages were from 1 day to 2 years with a median of 10 days. in 25 patients (26%), predisposing factors were identified, the most common of which were neural tube defects and urinary tract anomalies. the causative agents were escherichia coli (53%), klebsiella-enterobacter species (16%), citrobacter diversus (9%), salmonella species (9%), proteus mirabilis (4%), serratia marcescens (3%), bacteroides fragilis (3%), and aeromonas species (2%). at the time of diagnosis, gram-stained smears of cerebrospinal fluid revealed gram-negative bacilli in 61% of patients. the causative organism was cultured from blood obtained from 55% of patients, and 21% had positive urine culture results. the cerebrospinal fluid leukocyte counts ranged from 0 to 80,600 cells/mm3, and the cerebrospinal fluid/serum glucose concentration ratio was less than 0.5 in 72% of patients. antimicrobial regimens varied greatly. after initiation of antibiotic therapy, an average of 3 days was needed for eradication of bacteria from cerebrospinal fluid. the case-fatality rate was 17%, and 61% of  survivors had long-term sequelae that included seizure disorders, hydrocephalus,  physical disability, developmental delay, and hearing loss.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of ceftazidime on fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (caz) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout japan in 1989 and 1991. those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic90 of caz in 1991 were markedly higher against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. also, among other bacteria such as providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, xanthomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to caz were observed in high proportions. however, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of caz on streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella spp, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, haemophilus influenzae and anaerobic gpc (gram-positive cocci). 2. among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant gram-negative bacilli of enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. it appears therefore, that caz failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these  strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. antimicrobial activities of caz on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. however, it was also demonstrated that caz maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. when it is additionally taken into account that caz is one of those limited drugs with activity against p. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that caz still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activities of ticarcillin alone and ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid against beta-lactamase producing and non-producing microorganisms.
AB  == a total of 818 clinical bacterial isolates were tested for the production of beta-lactamase by rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method and for the susceptibility to ticarcillin alone and in combination with clavulanic acid (2 micrograms/ml) by agar dilution method. these included 83 strains of methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), 31 of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), 49 of neisseria gonorrhoeae, 58 of haemophilus influenzae, 112  of escherichia coli, 118 of klebsiella pneumoniae, 58 of proteus mirabilis, 30 of proteus vulgaris, 60 of serratia marcescens, 113 of enterobacter cloacae, 60 of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 46 of bacteroides fragilis. the results revealed that  46.6% of p. mirabilis, 53.4% of h. influenzae, 57.1% of n. gonorrhoeae, 80% of p. vulgaris, 83.9% of mrsa, 85.6% of mssa, 87.5% of e. coli, 91.7% of s. marcescens, 95.7% of b. fragilis, 98.2% of e. cloacae, and 100% of k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa strains produced beta-lactamase. in general, beta-lactamase nonproducers were more susceptible to ticarcillin than beta-lactamase producers.  the ranges of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ticarcillin for beta-lactamase nonproducers of mssa, mrsa, h. influenzae, e. coli, p. vulgaris, s. marcescens, e. cloacae, b. fragilis and beta-lactamase producers of mssa, h. influenzae strains were all within the in vitro susceptible range. the presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the antibacterial activity of ticarcillin against beta-lactamase producers of mrsa, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris and b. fragilis strains. clavulanic acid had no synergistic activity for ticarcillin against s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa and e. cloacae.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of ceftriaxone against clinically isolated strains].
AB  == antibiotic activities (mics) of ceftriaxone (ctrx) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of  other cephems. 1. when compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated mic90s of ctrx: staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and providencia spp. no changes were observed in mic90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and peptostreptococcus spp. 2. the mic90 of ctrx to s. pneumoniae was high because a  large number of benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp) was present among this species. the mic80 to bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. other oxime-type cephems also had high mics against the above mentioned bacteria. therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as ctrx against pisp and b. fragilis group. 3. sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), cephamycin-resistant  as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. some of there resistant bacteria  are also ctrx-resistant, and ctrx had insufficient activities against them. 4. with regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with ctrx-resistance from year to year,  the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989  and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. it appears that those strains resistant to cephems including ctrx are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. ctrx, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. furthermore, considering that ctrx is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that ctrx is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.

TI  == pathogenicity of bacteroides fragilis group in rat intra-abdominal abscesses.
AB  == attempts were made to study the pathogenicity of some strains of bacteroides fragilis group in the rat intra-abdominal abscess model. multiple intraabdominal  abscesses were produced in 50 to 70% of animals when an inoculum containing 10(9) cfu/ml of any of the five species of bacteroides fragilis group was injected. rising homologous antibody titers determined by indirect fluorescent antibody test were observed till the 3rd week when tested last, indirectly confirming the  multiplication of the organisms as also evident by viable count of bacteria in the abscesses. in some cases in addition to inoculated organisms some intestinal  bacteria like escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and streptococcus spp. were also recovered from the abscess pus. studies with the electron microscope showed  presence of capsular polysaccharide only in bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides  thetaiotaomicron. it was doubtful in bacteroides distasonis and absent in bacteroides ovatus and bacteroides vulgatus, suggesting that virulence factor beside the capsular polysaccharide may be playing a role. further studies are required to investigate the virulence factor responsible for the pathogenicity of noncapsulated species.

TI  == pathogenesis of intraabdominal abscess formation: abscess-potentiating agents and inhibition of complement-dependent opsonization of abscess-inducing bacteria.
AB  == bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli are synergistic in the production of intraabdominal abscesses. however, these bacteria initiate abscess formation only when inoculated with an agent such as autoclaved colonic contents (acc) or bran (a fiber analogue). the mechanism of action of the abscess-potentiating agent was studied. opsonins in normal mouse serum were determined for phagocytic killing by murine neutrophils of b. fragilis and e. coli. opsonization required fixation of  complement by the alternative pathway. acc (0.2 mg/ml) and bran (1.0 mg/ml) inhibited phagocytic killing of proteus mirabilis in the presence of normal but not immune serum. assay of the alternative pathway of complement activation indicated that both bacterial components and abscess-potentiating agents in an abscess-inducing mixture activated complement. these findings suggest that abscess-potentiating agents inhibit opsonization and therefore the subsequent phagocytic killing of bacteria in the nonimmune host.

AB  == tazobactam (ytr 830), a new beta-lactamase inhibitor, was evaluated for its effect in combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum, but beta-lactamase sensitive, penicillin, against 14 common bacteria. a total of 1,086 clinical isolates from different clinical specimens were tested for beta-lactamase production by the rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method. their susceptibilities  to piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam in a ratio of 8:1 by the agar dilution method were evaluated. the percentage of beta-lactamase producing strains ranged from 14.5% to 100% in these tested species. in general, the beta-lactamase producers were more resistant to piperacillin than the beta-lactamase nonproducers with higher minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). for the beta-lactamase producers, tazobactam decreased the mics of piperacillin prominently in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, salmonella species and bacteroides fragilis, with a 4-fold or greater decrease in mic50, mic90 and the geometric mean of mic. for serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mics did not change after adding tazobactam. for other species, there was a moderate decrease in mics. we conclude that tazobactam is an effective beta-lactamase inhibitor for increasing the antimicrobial activity of piperacillin against beta-lactamase producing strains of many species of bacteria.

TI  == bacterial killing in vitro by abscess-derived neutrophils.
AB  == in the absence of antimicrobial therapy, bacteria such as bacteriodes fragilis, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis may persist within an intra-abdominal abscess in the presence of large numbers of neutrophils which, under optimal conditions in vitro, can readily phagocytose and kill the same bacterial strains. neutrophils taken from abscesses induced by gram-negative bacteria such as those  above contain viable organisms. on incubation in vitro in the presence of serum,  these neutrophils kill the bacteria phagocytosed in the abscess poorly, if at all, yet can readily kill organisms added in vitro. to determine possible mechanisms that might explain this, we examined the bactericidal activity in vitro of neutrophils from a range of abscesses induced by one or two species of bacteria plus an abscess-potentiating agent, bran. the organisms studied were b.  fragilis, e. coli, p. mirabilis and staphylococcus aureus. the killing in vitro of e. coli and p. mirabilis, engulfed within an abscess, was significantly less than that of the same organisms when they were added to the in-vitro assay. in contrast, the killing of s. aureus was similar, whether engulfed in vivo or in vitro. however, s. aureus was less susceptible to phagocytosis and killing in vitro than p. mirabilis or e. coli, and the killing of s. aureus during in-vitro  incubation of neutrophils that had engulfed the organism with in the abscess was  similar to that of the gram-negative bacteria engulfed within the abscess.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the in-vitro activity of cefodizime: a review.
AB  == for enterobacteriaceae, mic50s and mic90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: escherichia  coli 0.12 and 0.5, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, serratia  marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. the activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. haemophilus spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as n. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic50s and mic90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic50 and mic90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were generally resistant: streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (mic50 and mic90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium perfringens (mic50 and mic90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). these results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.

TI  == molecular analysis of the bacteroides fragilis reca gene.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of a 2.5-kb dna segment containing the bacteroides fragilis reca gene was determined. the coding region of the reca gene specifies a protein of 318 amino acids. the reca protein of b. fragilis shows significant homology with that of escherichia coli, thiobacillus ferrooxidans, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis. no sos box characteristic of lexa-regulated promoters could be identified in the 5'-noncoding region of the b. fragilis reca  gene. promoter activity of the cloned reca gene in e. coli was located within a 113-bp fragment of the b. fragilis dna by in vitro construction of operon fusions with a promoterless lacz gene. the transcription start point for this gene in b.  fragilis was determined by primer extension analysis.

TI  == [in vitro activity of imipenem against hospital bacteria].
AB  == imipenem proved highly active against enterobacteriaceae: the different bacterial groups exhibited similar mode mics (0.12 to 0.25 micrograms/ml), except for serratia (0.25-0.5 micrograms/ml), proteus mirabilis (0.5 micrograms/ml), indole-positive proteus (2 micrograms/ml) and providencia (1 mu/ml). the mics of  cefotaxime-resistant strains (cephalosporinase hyperproducing or very broad spectrum betalactamase producing) were within the susceptibility range. imipenem  also exhibited satisfactory activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mode mic 1-2 micrograms/ml), although resistant strains by decrease of permeability were observed, and against acinetobacter (mode mic 0.25-0.5 micrograms/ml). the mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 micrograms/ml (mode mic 0.5) for haemophilus and from 0.25  to 1 micrograms/ml for neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of the betalactamase producing status. the mics for n. meningitidis were less than 0.06 micrograms/ml. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 micrograms/ml (mode mic 0.016). the mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely from 0.016 to 64 micrograms/ml and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008 to 0.03 micrograms/ml). the mics for enterococci varied from 0.12 to 32 micrograms/ml (mode mic 1-2). with the exception of clostridium difficile, anaerobic bacteria were inhibited by concentrations lower than 1 (mode mic 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for bacteroides fragilis).

TI  == [bacteremia secondary to decubitus ulcer].
AB  == we have prospectively evaluated 16 episodes of bacteremia induced by decubitus ulcers. the most commonly isolated microorganisms were staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacteroides fragilis. bacteremia was polymicrobial in 5 cases (31%). most ulcers were already present at the time  of admission, but bacteremia developed within the hospital in 13 patients. in 3 patients, ulcers did not show local features of infection. the initial antibiotic therapy was satisfactory in 13 cases. mortality rate directly associated with bacteremia was 18%, but the overall mortality rate was 62%. we did not identify data permitting a reliable prediction of the findings of blood culture; therefore, the initial empirical therapy should be active against staphylococcus  aureus, pseudomonas, enteric gram-negative bacilli and anaerobes including bacteroides fragilis.

TI  == comparative in vitro and in vivo activities of piperacillin combined with the beta-lactamase inhibitors tazobactam, clavulanic acid, and sulbactam.
AB  == tazobactam (ytr-830h), a novel beta-lactamase inhibitor, was compared with clavulanic acid and sulbactam for enhancement of the activity of piperacillin against beta-lactamase-producing, piperacillin-resistant clinical isolates. piperacillin mics were determined in media containing a fixed concentration of 2  or 4 micrograms of the inhibitors per ml. the higher concentration was generally  more effective. tazobactam was superior to sulbactam in enhancing the spectrum and potency of piperacillin. although the calvulanic acid combination was more potent, tazobactam was effective for a similar spectrum of resistant gram-negative clinical isolates containing beta-lactamase. mics were reduced to the susceptible range for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp.,  salmonella spp., and shigella spp. combinations with tazobactam and sulbactam, but not clavulanic acid, were effective against morganella spp. some antagonism of the activity of piperacillin was observed with clavulanic acid but not with tazobactam or sulbactam. the inhibitors were similarly effective with piperacillin against beta-lactamase-positive staphylococcus spp. and the bacteroides fragilis group. piperacillin-tazobactam was more effective against a  broader spectrum of gram-negative enteric bacteria than ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid was. combinations with tazobactam or clavulanic acid had a broader spectrum of activity than combinations with sulbactam against bacteria that produce characterized plasmid-mediated enzymes of clinical significance. in  particular, piperacillin with tazobactam or clavulanic acid, but not with sulbactam, inhibited tem-1, tem-2, and shv-1 enzymes. in vitro activity was reflected in vivo. tazobactam and clavulanic acid were superior to sulbactam in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of piperacillin in mice infected with beta-lactamase-positive e. coli, k. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus aureus. only combinations with tazobactam and sulbactam were effective against the morganella infection. tazobactam has a good potential for enhancing the clinical efficacy of piperacillin.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == fk482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. it displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (cfix), cefaclor (ccl) or cephalexin (cex) against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci including staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the streptococcus group. moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, fk482  had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of cfix but superior to that of ccl or cex. however, it was clearly inferior to cfix in activity against serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. strains of s. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to fk482. all tested strains of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ccl and cex were susceptible to fk482, as were all the strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (ampc). fk482, like cfix, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of ccl or cex. the antibacterial activity of fk482 against csh2  strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. fk482 showed higher affinity  for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) (3, 2 and 1) of s. aureus than did cfix, ccl and cex. fk482 also showed very high affinity for the pbps (2 and 3) of e. faecalis and pbps (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of e. coli. the bactericidal activity of fk482 against s. aureus was almost as strong as that of ampc and superior to that of ccl or cex. against gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, fk482 was similar to cfix and superior to ccl and cex in bactericidal activity.

TI  == role of intestinal anaerobic bacteria in colonization resistance.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to clarify the role of the intestinal anaerobe bacteria in colonization resistance. germfree mice were associated with escherichia coli c25 and either (a) no other species; (b) enterococcus; (c) escherichia coli m14 and proteus mirabilis, or (d) bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides vulgatus. all species colonized the cecum in high numbers, but only enterococcus significantly limited the translocation of escherichia coli c25 to mesenteric lymph nodes. however, the overall translocation rates were similar in  all groups and ranged from 60% to 100%, due to translocation of other intestinal  flora in addition to escherichia coli c25. conventionally reared mice were given  either streptomycin, bacitracin/streptomycin or metronidazole which selectively eliminated facultative gram-negative bacteria, nearly all bacterial species or strictly anaerobic bacteria respectively. only metronidazole significantly increased the rates of translocation of normal intestinal bacteria into mesenteric lymph nodes. cohort groups of mice were then orally inoculated with drug resistant escherichia coli c25, which actively colonized the cecum of all drug treated mice and translocated to the mesenteric lymph nodes of approximately half the streptomycin and metronidazole treated mice and nearly all the bacitracin/streptomycin treated mice. these results indicate that anaerobic bacteria play a pivotal role in limiting the translocation of normal intestinal bacteria, but that other bacterial groups also have a role in preventing the intestinal colonization and translocation of potential pathogens.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new penem, cgp 31608.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cgp 31608, a new penem, against aerobic and anaerobic organisms was evaluated and compared with those of other beta-lactams. cgp 31608  inhibited escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, and salmonella, shigella, aeromonas, and yersinia spp. with mics for 50% of the strains (mic50s) of 2 to 4 micrograms/ml and mic90s of 4 micrograms/ml, compared with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and imipenem mics of less than 0.25 microgram/ml. mic90s were 8 micrograms/ml for enterobacter species and c. freundii, for which other agents had mics of 32 micrograms/ml, except imipenem, which had equal activity. the mic90 for proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia stuartii, and providencia rettgeri was 8 micrograms/ml, compared with less than 2 micrograms/ml shown by the other agents. acinetobacter species resistant to other agents except imipenem were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml, as were pseudomonas aeruginosa, including piperacillin-, ceftazidime-, and gentamicin-resistant isolates. the mic for p. cepacia, p. fluorescens, and p. acidovorans was less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, but that for p. maltophilia was greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. hemolytic streptococci a, b, c, g, and f were inhibited by less than 1 micrograms/ml, but the mic for streptococcus faecalis was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. mics for staphylococcus aureus methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, as were those for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant s. epidermidis. bacteroides fragilis and clostridium species and fusobacterium spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. cgp 31608 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, pse-1, oxa-2, pse-4, or by s. aureus. chromosomal beta-lactamases of type ia in enterobacter cloacae p99 and morganella morganii, ic in p. vulgaris, k-1 in k. oxytoca, and id in p. aeruginosa also did not hydrolyze cgp 31608. it inhibited tem-1, but the 50% inhibitory concentration was 14.2 micrograms/ml compared with 0.15 micrograms/ml for the p99 enzyme. cgp 31608 induced beta-lactamases in p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae, c. freundii and providencia rettgeri, but there was no increase in mics for the isolates and it did not select strains derepressed for beta-lactamase production. synergy of cgp 31608 and gentamicin was found against 90% p. aeruginosa, 60% enterobacter cloacae, and 50% serratia marcescens strains. no synergy was found with rifampin. a postantibiotic effect was found against e. coli.

TI  == in-vitro bacterial killing kinetics of ticarcillin/clavulanic acid.
AB  == an in-vitro model was developed to study the rates of killing by ticarcillin/clavulanic acid combinations of various beta-lactamase producing, ticarcillin resistant, logarithmic phase clinical isolates. killing, defined as a 3 log reduction, was dependent on the organism, the concentration of clavulanic acid and the duration of exposure. for most isolates studied an optimum period of exposure to and concentration of clavulanic acid could be defined. certain test strains showed optimum response to readily attainable in-vivo concentrations of clavulanic acid while other strains, although sensitive by mic data showed a poor response. the clinical implications of this are discussed.

TI  == in vitro study of the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against recent clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, was studied by a standardized single disc method. a total of 990 clinical isolates were tested, including 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria. ofloxacin was highly active against 683 strains (70.41%), had intermediate activity against 109 (11.23%) and had no activity against 178 (18.35%). ofloxacin was highly active against e. coli, klebsiella sp., citrobacter sp., proteus mirabilis, proteus morganii, salmonella sp., campylobacter jejuni, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, eubacterium sp., propionibacterium acnes and streptococcus sp. pseudomonas sp., serratia sp. and proteus vulgaris had percentages of resistance to ofloxacin of 37.11%, 32% and 33.33% respectively. high percentages of resistance to ofloxacin  were found only for providencia sp., proteus rettgeri and bacteroides fragilis. with regard to streptococcus faecalis, the results obtained with the disc procedure were not reliable and mic determination was necessary to assess the behaviour of the drug.

TI  == effects of bacteroides asaccharolyticus cells and b. fragilis surface components  on serum opsonisation and phagocytosis.
AB  == the effect of bacteroides asaccharolyticus on the opsonisation and phagocytosis of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmnl) was investigated. uptake of most isolates of staphylococci, streptococci and clostridia by pmnl after opsonisation with serum treated with b. asaccharolyticus was largely unimpaired. the same treatment of serum before opsonisation of isolates of pseudomonas, enterobacter, klebsiella and gardnerella resulted in the uptake by pmnl varying with individual isolates; a large reduction occurred with some and none with others. treatment of serum with b. fragilis lipopolysaccharide before opsonisation of proteus mirabilis produced a marked reduction in uptake, whereas treatment with b. fragilis capsular polysaccharide had little effect.

TI  == sepsis and cholestasis: the in vitro effects of bacterial products on 14c-taurocholate uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.
AB  == bacterial endotoxins are known to be an important cause of cholestasis, yet not all organisms that cause cholestasis produce endotoxins. in order to determine whether bacterial products other than endotoxins may be involved in the cholestasis process, 14c-taurocholate (tc) uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes was measured in the presence of mid-log, stationary and mid-death phase bacterial broth supernatants from eight common bacterial pathogens. the results were then correlated with a quantitative assessment of endotoxin production by each organism. supernatants from haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumonia demonstrated a striking inhibitory effect on bile salt uptake (77.2 +/- 6.7, 46.9 +/- 6.5 and 32.9 +/- 7.1% maximum inhibition of 14c-tc uptake, respectively) when compared to sterile broth controls. streptococcus faecalis (enterococcus), escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and bacteroides  fragilis products, on the other hand, had relatively minor effects (12.3 +/- 5.2, 12.0 +/- 7.5, 8.4 +/- 6.7 and less than 5.0% inhibition respectively), while those from proteus mirabilis had an intermediate effect (18.5 +/- 8.3% inhibition). bile salt efflux rates (16.0 +/- 2.7 and 25.1 +/- 4.2 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, mean +/- sem) were similar in bacteria demonstrating marked uptake inhibition (haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) when compared to those with only minor inhibitory effects (staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis) (14.3 +/- 1.1 and 18.4 +/- 2.6 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, respectively, p greater than 0.05). 14c-tc uptake inhibition did not correlate with the amount of endotoxin produced by each organism (r = 0.251). the results of this study indicate that bacteria produce a factor other than endotoxin that significantly inhibits bile salt uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the efficacy of pefloxacin in comparison to gentamicin in the treatment of experimentally induced peritonitis in rats.
AB  == a reproducible experimental model of intra-abdominal infections in rats has been  devised in order to stimulate intra-abdominal sepsis in patients. pre-operatively, the rats were fed with lean ground beef for two weeks in order to change the intestinal flora to one similar to that of humans. a 1 cm segment of ileum was isolated on its vascular pedicle. the intestine was then divided at  each end of the segment and intestinal continuity was re-established by an end-to-end anastomosis. the segment of ileum was then returned to the abdominal cavity. this experimental model was used to compare the efficacy of pefloxacin alone and in combination with metronidazole with the combination gentamicin and metronidazole in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections. seventy per cent of the untreated animals died within two days. within three days 40% of the animals  receiving pefloxacin died. animals treated with pefloxacin plus metronidazole or  gentamicin plus metronidazole had a significantly decreased mortality and increased cure rates during the experimental period. only 5% of these animals died. thus the combination of pefloxacin and metronidazole seems to be as successful as gentamicin plus metronidazole in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == neutrophil activity in abscess-bearing mice: comparative studies with neutrophils isolated from peripheral blood, elicited peritoneal exudates, and abscesses.
AB  == intraabdominal abscesses were induced in mice by intraperitoneal inoculation of bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli plus bran as the abscess-potentiating agent. six- or seven-day-old abscesses were mechanically disaggregated in buffer, and the cells obtained were fractionated on discontinuous percoll density gradients. neutrophil populations of different density, each approximately 90% pure, were isolated. when the abscess-derived neutrophils were subsequently incubated with normal serum in vitro under aerobic conditions, the viability of the gram-negative bacteria that had been phagocytosed within the abscess did not  change significantly. this anergy to intracellular bacteria (on subsequent incubation in vitro under optimal conditions for phagocytic killing) was also found for neutrophils that had been obtained from abscesses induced by a mixture  that included proteus mirabilis plus b. fragilis and from those induced by e. coli plus p. mirabilis. while unable to significantly kill intracellular organisms that had been phagocytosed in vivo, the abscess-derived neutrophils could engulf and kill organisms to which they were exposed in vitro. neutrophils  from abscesses induced by p. mirabilis only plus bran killed that organism introduced in vitro significantly more effectively than the organisms that had been engulfed in vivo. in contrast, neutrophils from abscesses induced by the gram-positive organism staphylococcus aureus plus bran were able to kill their intracellular organisms on subsequent incubation in vitro as effectively as they  could kill added s. aureus. neutrophils isolated from the peripheral blood and from induced peritoneal exudates of abscess-bearing mice were able to phagocytose and kill organisms in vitro with greater efficiency than abscess-derived neutrophils. the mechanism whereby neutrophils from abscesses induced by the gram-positive organism s. aureus can kill the organisms phagocytosed in vivo on subsequent in vitro incubation, in contrast to the relative anergy to their intracellular organisms displayed by neutrophils derived from abscesses induced by combinations of gram-negative bacteria, is not known.

TI  == the activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy 7 beta acyl ureido cephalosporin.
AB  == the activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy ureido cephalosporin, was determined against 726 clinical isolates. ninety percent of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, salmonella, and shigella species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin and piperacillin against these species. concentrations of 25 micrograms/ml of cefbuperazone were needed to inhibit serratia marcescens and providencia species, and 50% of enterobacter cloacae had mics greater than 25 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was less active by 8 to 32-fold than cefotaxime or moxalactam against most enterobacteriaceae. cefbuperazone did not inhibit acinetobacter or pseudomonas species. hemolytic streptococci were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml  and staphylococci by 25 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone had activity comparable to cefoxitin and moxalactam against bacteroides fragilis with mic90s of 6.3 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was not hydrolyzed by plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamases and was an inhibitor of the p99 e. cloacae beta-lactamase with an i50 of 1 microgram/ml. it was a less effective inhibitor of the k. oxytoca k1 and e. coli tem-1 beta-lactamases than was clavulanic acid. cefbuperazone induced beta-lactamases in p. aeruginosa and resistant e. cloacae. a permeability barrier in e. cloacae, c. freundii and p. aeruginosa is suggested by the potentiation of  cefbuperazone's activity by edta.

TI  == antibacterial activity of ticarcillin in the presence of clavulanate potassium.
AB  == the antibacterial effects produced by ticarcillin disodium plus clavulanate potassium, a combination of the broad-spectrum penicillin ticarcillin, and the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid as the potassium salt, have been measured in vitro and in experimental infection studies. the presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the activity of ticarcillin against a wide range of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. these included ticarcillin-resistant strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, and the anaerobe bacteroides fragilis. in addition, beta-lactamase-producing isolates of  hemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ticarcillin and clavulanate. clavulanic acid did not influence the activity of ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible bacteria. the bactericidal effects of the antibiotic combination were measured in an in vitro kinetic model in which the drug concentrations were varied to simulate those measured in humans after intravenous dosing with ticarcillin (3.0 g) and clavulanate potassium (100 mg clavulanic acid). in these tests, ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid had pronounced bactericidal activity against ticarcillin-resistant bacteria. the protection of ticarcillin by clavulanic acid from inactivation by bacterial beta-lactamases in  vivo was demonstrated in experimental infection models in which the efficacy of the ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid combination against infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing bacteria was correlated with the presence of effective concentrations of both antibiotic and inhibitor at the site of infection.

TI  == role of imipenem/cilastatin in the treatment of soft tissue infections.
AB  == imipenem/cilastatin was given to 243 evaluable patients with moderately severe to severe soft tissue infections. cultures prior to therapy yielded staphylococcus aureus (108 isolates), group d and non-group d enterococci (49), group a streptococci (42), other aerobic gram-positive cocci (72), pseudomonas aeruginosa (54), escherichia coli (32), proteus mirabilis (31), enterobacter (21), klebsiella (20), other aerobic gram-negative rods (58), bacteroides fragilis group (16), and other anaerobes (65). overall, 95 percent (230 of 243) of the patients treated had clinical cure (137 of 243) or improvement (93 of 243). of the 506 strains of etiologic bacterial pathogens isolated from these patients and tested against imipenem, 498 (98 percent) were susceptible to the antibiotic. many were resistant to both older and newer penicillins and cephalosporins. serial cultures of infection sites revealed that 426 of 498 (86 percent) of pre-therapy bacterial isolates were eradicated by imipenem/cilastatin therapy. eight of 498 etiologic pathogens (1.6 percent) acquired resistance to imipenem (seven p. aeruginosa and one enterococcus). such resistance acquisition was associated with clinical failure in two patients. imipenem/cilastatin appears to  be a highly effective, relatively safe therapy of soft tissue infections caused by a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes, both  polymicrobial and monomicrobial in nature. imipenem/cilastatin should be considered particularly when infection by the more antibiotic-resistant of these  bacteria is suspected or proved.

AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. imipenem proved highly active against enterobacteriaceae, with an mic less than or equal to 0.25  for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. the different groups of enterobacteriaceae exhibited  similar mode mics (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of serratia (0.25-0.5), p. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive proteus (2), and providencia (1). mics of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. imipenem also  exhibited satisfactory activity against p. aeruginosa (mode mic 1-2) and acinetobacter sp. (mode mic: 0.25-0.5). mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode mic: 0.5) for haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. mics for meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode mic : 0.016); mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely,  from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci, except for enterococci, and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); mics for enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode mic: 1-2). except  for four c. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode mics: 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for b. fragilis).

TI  == abscess induction in beige (bg/bg) mutant mice.
AB  == humans with chediak-higashi syndrome (chs) and several animal species with similar defects have been reported to have increased susceptibility to infection, including abscess formation, associated with granulocyte abnormalities. these defects were investigated by comparing mice of the sb/le strain, homozygous for the beige mutation, with their heterozygous littermates and with normal balb/c mice with respect to the ability to form intraabdominal abscesses. mice were autopsied 7 days after the intraperitoneal inoculation of a mixture of bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli and an abscess-potentiating agent, bran. although homozygous beige mice formed more numerous abscesses than controls, the  total abscess sizes and bacterial contents were not significantly different. histopathologically, the abscesses resembled those in normal mice. phagocytic killing assays using granulocytes from beige mice of the sb/le and c57bl/6j strains showed no significant differences between homozygous beige mice and controls. within the context of these experiments in which neutrophil function in vivo and in vitro was examined with respect to anaerobic and facultative gram-negative bacteria, it is concluded that beige mice can respond adequately to an infectious bacterial challenge. the increased susceptibility to an infection seen in various species with chs-like disease may relate to virulence factors of  the infecting organisms and defects in host defences documented by others but not manifest in these experiments.

AB  == the determinant responsible for the ability of bacteroides spp. to inhibit polymorph phagocytic killing of aerobic organisms has not yet been identified. therefore, the roles of lipopolysaccharide and capsular polysaccharide of b. fragilis were investigated. serum-resistant and serum-sensitive strains of proteus mirabilis were used to indicate inhibition of phagocytic killing and serum killing of aerobes. whole organisms of b. fragilis, purified lipopolysaccharide and capsular polysaccharide were added to an in-vitro phagocytosis system. results showed that greater than 10(7) bacteroides/ml inhibited both serum and phagocytic killing. concentrations below 10(7)/ml had little effect on either process. purified capsular polysaccharide (10 or 100 micrograms/ml), either alone in the system or in combination with sub-inhibitory  concentrations of b. fragilis also markedly inhibited serum and phagocytic killing. lipopolysaccharide (9 micrograms/ml) appeared relatively inert. b. ovatus, reputedly non-capsulated, produced identical results to those obtained with b. fragilis, but an encapsulated strain of streptococcus pneumoniae did not  inhibit serum or phagocytic killing.

TI  == clavulanic acid in combination with ticarcillin: an in-vitro comparison with other beta-lactams.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of ticarcillin in combination with clavulanic acid was compared with that of ticarcillin alone, piperacillin, cefotaxime and, where appropriate, other beta-lactams against a total of 301 recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. an agar dilution procedure was used to determine mics and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. mics of the combination of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid were expressed as mics of ticarcillin in the presence of 5 or 10 mg/l of clavulanic acid. against most members of the enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii and serratia marcescens), ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid was as active as or more active than piperacillin. against staphylococcus aureus. haemophilus influenzae and the bacteroides fragilis group  the combination was considerably more active than piperacillin. piperacillin was  more active than the ticarcillin/clavulanic acid combination against pseudomonas  aeruginosa.

TI  == pathogenic synergy: mixed intra-abdominal infections.
AB  == in this article we review our researches into the pathogenesis of mixed infections. these may conveniently be divided into in vitro and in vivo studies.  in vitro we confirmed that interference with the killing of aerobes by polymorphonuclear leucocytes (pmn's) is a property of the bacteroides strains tested and appears to depend on competition for opsonins i.e. complement factors. further studies are in progress to define which complement factors and which bacterial structures are involved. the influence of b. fragilis on chemotaxis has also been studied. our preliminary data suggest that b. fragilis is itself poorly chemotactic and reduces the chemoattractivity of proteus mirabilis. this observation is surprising when we consider that abscess formation is the hall-mark of b. fragilis infections and needs clarification. in vivo we have developed a skin infection model in mice which is economical and gives reproducible and quantitative results. in this model we have demonstrated pathogenic synergy between escherichia coli and b. fragilis. further studies are  planned to assess the role of complement and bacterial factors in this in vivo synergy.

AB  == the in vitro activity of e-0702 was compared with the in vitro activity of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam against 600 gram-positive and  gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates. e-0702 had a minimal inhibitory concentration for 50% of isolates (mic50) of 25 micrograms for staphylococcus aureus, 50 micrograms for staphylococcus epidermidis, and 1.6 to 3.1 micrograms for streptococci, with streptococcus faecalis resistant. e-0702 had mic50s against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter aerogenes comparable to those of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam, but mic90s were higher than those of the other agents. it was as active as the other  agents against proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp., and shigella spp., but was four- to eightfold less active against citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, providencia spp., morganella spp., and proteus vulgaris, with isolates in each species resistant. activity against bacteroides fragilis was fourfold less than that of cefoxitin. e-0702 was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases and was only a weak inhibitor of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. there was an inoculum effect for e. cloacae, serratia spp., morganella spp., and pseudomonas spp.

TI  == effect of anaerobic bacteria on killing of proteus mirabilis by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  == killing of proteus mirabilis by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes was tested in  the presence of different bacteroides species. in vitro experiments showed that anaerobic bacteria interfered with the killing of aerobic bacteria. however, this inhibitory effect was not a property of all bacteroides species. bacteroides gingivalis w83 showed the greatest inhibitory effect of the five bacteroides strains tested. killing of p. mirabilis was inhibited by the culture supernatant  of b. gingivalis but not by washed cells. two factors were found in the supernatant of b. gingivalis to account for the inhibitory effect. one was heat stable with a molecular weight of less than 3,500 and inhibited the killing activity of leukocytes, and the other was heat labile and partly inactivated the  complement system. the killing experiments paralleled chemiluminescence measurements.

AB  == six transtracheal aspirations (tta) and expectorated sputum specimens were collected from four children suffering from cystic fibrosis who had pulmonary infection. specimens obtained from both sites were cultured for aerobic bacteria  and tta aspirates were also cultured for anaerobes. differences in bacteria isolated in tta and sputum aspirates were present in all instances. six isolates  were recovered in both sites (three pseudomonas aeruginosa, two staphylococcus aureus and one aspergillus flavus). five aerobic isolates were recovered only in  the expectorated sputum and not in tta aspirations (two klebsiella pneumoniae and one each of p. aeruginosa, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis). nine organisms were isolated only from the tta (two each of veillonella parvula and alpha hemolytic streptococci, and one each of bacteroides fragilis, b. melaninogenicus, lactobacillus sp., haemophilus influenzae and gamma hemolytic streptococci). the recovery of anaerobic organisms from four of the six tta specimens suggests a possible role for these organisms in the etiology of pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis. we found tta to be helpful in the bacterial diagnosis and management of pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis.

TI  == isolation of anaerobic organisms from kidney in serious renal infections.
AB  == we have studied 45 patients who underwent nephrectomy owing to unilateral renal sepsis for anaerobic and aerobic bacterial growth in the urine and kidney. anaerobic organisms were recovered from 11 patients: 10 had positive kidney cultures, and only 1 had positive kidney and urine cultures. there was a distinct relationship between anaerobic infection of the kidney and urinary tract obstruction; 44 per cent of the obstructed kidneys yielded anaerobic organisms versus only 11 per cent of the unobstructed kidneys. bacteroides fragilis was the anaerobic organism most often cultured. it is suggested that cultures for anaerobic organisms be performed together with aerobic cultures in patients with  symptomatic upper urinary tract infections associated with urinary obstruction. in patients in whom anaerobic infection is suspected, in spite of negative anaerobic cultures, antibiotic treatment for anaerobes should be added to the existing therapeutic measures.

TI  == management and microbiology of cutaneous abscesses.
AB  == cutaneous abscesses in the perineal region contain primarily anaerobes commonly found in stool. non-perineal abscesses contain mixed microflora indigenous to the skin. bacteroides fragilis, the only anaerobe resistant to penicillin, is found predominantly in the perineal area. staphylococcus aureus, although the most common aerobe found, is seen less frequently than expected and is almost always resistant to penicillin. escherichia coli and neisseria gonorrhoeae are rarely found. incision and drainage is the primary mode of treatment. fever is rare, though tachycardia is common in patients with normal host defenses. patients with altered host defenses may require initial culture and gram-stained smear to determine appropriate antibiotic therapy. the gram-stained smear reliably indicates sterile and mixed abscesses, as well as those containing pure s aureus. incision and drainage alone is the only therapy required in the usual patient. since in these patients antibiotics are not required, initial culture and gram-stained smear are unnecessary.

AB  == the activities of azlocillin and mezlocillin were compared with those of carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and pirbenicillin against a wide range of gram-negative organisms. the two new drugs were considerably more active than carbenicillin against klebsiella species and escherichia coli. carbenicillin was  twice as active against proteus mirabilis as mezlocillin and four times as active as azlocillin. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, azlocillin was eight times as active as carbenicillin. azlocillin and mezlocillin were twice as active as carbenicillin against bacteroides fragilis, and these drugs showed a high degree  of activity against haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae.

TI  == inhibition of phagocytosis in vitro by obligate anaerobes.
AB  == a variety of species of obligate anaerobes have been shown to interfere with the  phagocytosis and killing of proteus mirabilis and other aerobic bacteria in vitro. although all the obligate anaerobes examined showed this activity, the effect was greatest with strains of bacteroides melaninogenicus and b. fragilis.  in contrast, none of the 36 aerobes tested acted in this way. these observations  suggest that the presence of obligate anaerobes may be fundamental to the pathogenesis of some types of infections.

TI  == [growth of non-sporing anaerobes in an oxygen-free blood culture system (author's transl)].
AB  == the efficacy of the commercially available vacutainer blood culture system to support the growth of non-sporing anaerobes was compared with two laboratory-prepared blood culture media (supplemented thioglycollate medium and brain heart infusion). the media were inoculated with 10, 100 and 1000 organisms  of the species tested, and the number of colony-forming units was determined at intervals of 8-10 hrs. analogous experiments were performed with batches of the media to which 10% vol/vol of human blood had been added. from the results obtained with strains of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides splanchnicus, sphaerophorus necrophorus, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and propionibacterium acnes it became obvious that growth of non-sporing anaerobes was significantly enhanced in the vacutainer culture tubes, whereas enterobacteriaceae and streptococcus spp. grew equally well in all the media tested.

TI  == comparison of in vitro activity of cephalexin, cephradine, and cefaclor.
AB  == inhibitory activity of cephalexin, cephradine, and cefaclor was compared by the who-ics agar dilution technique. cefaclor was substantially more active against staphylococci, streptococci, gonococci, meningococci, haemophilus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, salmonellae, and shigellae than was cephalexin, which in turn was more active than cephradine. cefaclor appeared to be less resistant to staphylococcal penicillinase than did the other two agents. none of these cephalosporins was active against enterobacter, serratia, indole-positive proteeae, pseudomonas, or  bacteroides fragilis.

TI  == in vitro activity of gentamicin and minocycline alone and in combination against  bacteria associated with intra-abdominal sepsis.
AB  == the minimal inhibitory concentrations of gentamicin and minocycline alone and in  combination were determined by a broth microdilution method for 100 aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic isolates representative of pathogens recovered from patients with intra-abdominal sepsis. gentamicin inhibited all strains of klebsiella, enterobacter, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in concentrations of 0.4 to  3.1 mug/ml and all strains of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis in concentrations of 0.8 to 12.5 mug/ml. whereas minocycline did not consistently inhibit these organisms in concentrations of 1.6 mug or less/ml, it did act synergistically with gentamicin against 43% of the enterobacteriaceae tested in clinically achievable concentrations; significant synergy was most common with e. coli (60%). minocycline inhibited 62% of bacteroides fragilis, 71% of clostridium, 40% of anaerobic cocci, and 40% of enterococci tested in concentrations of 1.6 mug or less/ml. whereas gentamicin rarely inhibited these organisms in concentrations of 6.2 mug or less/ml, it did act synergistically with minocycline against 20% of b. fragilis, 67% of clostridium, 22% of anaerobic cocci, and 22% of enterococci (which had minimal inhibitory concentrations of minocycline within the range tested) at clinically achievable concentrations. although only four (13%) of the 30 isolates resistant to both gentamicin and minocycline alone were inhibited by clinically achievable concentrations of the combination, the observed synergy, particularly against strains of e. coli, was considered to be of potential clinical usefulness. antagonism between gentamicin  and minocycline was not observed at the concentrations tested.

TI  == antibacterial activity of oxidized regenerated cellulose.
AB  == it has been demonstrated that oxidized regenerated cellulose promptly and markedly reduces the bacterial census of ten different strains of common pathogens when exposed to them in vitro. this was not true of two other hemostatic agents tested, namely, absorbable gelatin sponge and topical thrombin. wounds in guinea pigs in which oxidized regenerated cellulose was placed and infected with one of three pathogens had healing per primum in 39 of 40 instances. in similar control wounds and incisions in which absorbable gelatin sponge was placed, sepsis of the wound developed in 19 of 20 of the control group and in 39 of 40 guinea pigs in the absorbable gelatin sponge group.

TI  == significance of anaerobic bacteria isolated from the urinary tract. ii. experimental studies.
AB  == an attempt to cause retrograde urinary tract infection with bacteroides fragilis  (a strain subcultured in artificial media) failed to produce any significant renal infection in rats. intravenous inoculation with fusobacterium (a strain subcultured in artificial media) also did not cause demonstrable renal infection  in rats. nor could the anaerobic organism be demonstrated in the kidneys of these animals. animals receiving bacteroides (a strain subcultured in artificial media) inoculated directly into the renal medulla developed no renal infection. the anaerobic organism however, continued to be demonstrable in the kidneys of 78 per cent of these animals even on the 3rd day after inoculation. rabbits receiving bacteroides (a fresh clinical isolate) which was injected into the subcutaneously fixed kidney with ureteral obstruction all developed overt renal infection. there was also evidence of marked proliferation of the injected anaerobic bacteria and  pyuria in these cases.

TI  == pigment production by bacteroides species with reference to sub-classification.
AB  == all six reference strains of bacteroides species, 36 laboratory isolates conforming to this group, and individual strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, salmonella typhimurium and clostridum welchii produced a dense black pigment, identified as ferrus sulphide, when grown in cooked-meat media containing cystine and ferrous sulphate. this was an indicator effect resulting from the production of h2s by the bacteria in the presence of ferrous ions and was unrelated to the characteristic pigment produced by strains of b. melaninogenicus when grown on blood agar. a pigment was extracted by ultrasonic disintegration of washed cells of three reference strains of b. melanino-genicus  grown for 1 week in horse-blood broth and on human-blood agar. it was intracellular or cell-associated, soluble in water and had the spectrophotometric characteristics of a derivative of haemoglobin. no such pigment was extracted from strains of b. fragilis or b. necrophorus by similar procedures. pigment production is a stable characteristic of those strains of bacteroides called b. melaninogenicus and it is a significant property in the classification of the bacteroides group. however, the pigment-producing strains are not a homogenous species, and there were considerable differences between the results of biochemical tests and antibograms obtained with the three strains of b. melaninogenicus.

TI  == effect of colon flora and short-chain fatty acids on growth in vitro of pseudomonas aeruginsoa and enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == heat-stable antibacterial activity in the following suspensions was demonstrated  against pseudomonas aeruginosa at ph 6.5, 6.0, and 5.5: (i) pooled colon contents of normal mice; (ii) an anaerobic, 48-h culture of normal mouse feces; and (iii)  anaerobic, 48-h cultures of different bacteria from human colon flora (escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis). the lower the ph of the medium, the greater was the antibacterial activity of these suspensions. the antibacterial activity of five fatty acids (propionic, butyric, isobutyric, acetic, and formic acids) was greater against p. aeruginosa than against three enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p.  mirabilis) at all fatty acid concentrations (0.16 m to 0.005 m) and at the 3 ph values studied (5.5, 6.0, and 6.5). as the ph value increased, the antibacterial  activity decreased. antibacterial activity was greater at higher fatty acid concentrations, and at each ph value it was greatest for the fatty acids having high pk(a) values. lactic acid, with the lowest pk(a), exhibited little or no antibacterial activity. acetic and butyric acids, two of the three predominant volatile fatty acids determined by gas chromatography in the mouse colon contents and in the anaerobic culture of mouse feces, occurred in vivo in concentrations which inhibited growth of p. aeruginosa in vitro at the ph of the mouse cecum. these results suggest that undissociated short-chain fatty acids produced by the  colon flora may be a mechanism of intestinal resistance to colonization by p. aeruginosa.
