TI  == design of benzimidazole- and benzoxazole-2-thione derivatives as inhibitors of bacterial hyaluronan lyase.
AB  == bacterial hyaluronan lyases (hyal) degrade hyaluronan, an important component of  the extracellular matrix, and are involved in microbial spread. hyal inhibitors may serve as tools to study the role of the enzyme, its substrates and products in the course of bacterial infections. moreover, such enzyme inhibitors are potential candidates for antibacterial combination therapy. based on crystal structures of streptococcus pneumoniae hyal in complex with a hexasaccharide substrate and with different inhibitors, 1-acylated benzimidazole-2-thiones and benzoxazole-2-thiones were derived as new leads for the inhibition of streptococcus agalactiae strain 4755 hyal. structure-based optimization led to n-(3-phenylpropionyl)benzoxazole-2-thione, one of the most potent compounds known to date (ic(50) values: 24 mum at ph 7.4, 15 mum at ph 5). among the 27 new derivatives, other n-acylated benzimidazoles and benzoxazoles are just as active  at ph 7.4, but not at ph 5. the results support a binding mode characterized by interactions with residues in the catalytic site and with a hydrophobic patch.

TI  == screening of binding activity of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus suis to berries and juices.
AB  == antiadhesion therapy is a promising approach to the fight against pathogens. antibiotic resistance and the lack of effective vaccines have increased the search for new methods to prevent infectious diseases. previous studies have shown the antiadhesion activity of juice from cultivated cranberries (vaccinium macrocarpon ait.) against bacteria, especially e. coli. in this study, the binding of two streptococcal strains, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus  agalactiae, to molecular size fractions (fi, fii and fiii, <10 kda, 10-100 kda, and >100 kda, respectively) of berries and berry and fruit juices from 12 plant species were studied using a microtiter well assay. for streptococcus suis a hemagglutination inhibition assay was used. in general, binding activity was detected especially to wild cranberry (vaccinium oxycoccos l.) and to other vaccinium species. s. pneumoniae cells bound most to cranberry juice fraction fi  and s. agalactiae cells to cranberry fraction fiii. hemagglutination induced by s. suis was most effectively inhibited by cranberry fraction fii. nmr spectra of  some characteristic active and non-active fractions were also measured. they indicate that fractions fii and fiii contained proanthocyanidins and/or other phenolic compounds. the results suggest vaccinium berries as possible sources of  antiadhesives against bacterial infections.

TI  == novel 6-o-acylated vitamin c derivatives as hyaluronidase inhibitors with selectivity for bacterial lyases.
AB  == previously, we identified ascorbic acid 6-o-hexadecanoate as an up to 1500 times  more potent inhibitor of bacterial and bovine hyaluronidases than the parent compound, vitamin c, and determined a crystal structure of hyaluronidase from streptococcus pneumoniae in complex with the inhibitor. as the alkanoyl chain interacts with a hydrophobic patch of the enzyme we synthesized other 6-o-acylated vitamin c derivatives bearing various lipophilic residues and investigated the inhibition of streptococcus agalactiae strain 4755 hyaluronidase (saghyal(4755)) and of bovine testicular hyaluronidases (bth) in a turbidimetric  assay. all compounds showed selectivity for the bacterial enzyme. whereas vitamin c 6-o-hexanoate only weakly inhibited saghyal(4755), the inhibition of both enzymes increased with the length of the aliphatic chain. in the case of the 6-o-octadecanoate, ic(50) values of 0.9 and 39microm for saghyal(4755) and bth, respectively, were determined. partial replacement of the aliphatic chain with a  phenyl, p-phenylene or p-biphenylyl group resulted in inhibitors with activity in the lower micromolar range, too. the title compounds are among the most potent inhibitors of both enzymes known to date.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of macrolides against recent clinical isolates, and analysis of resistant mechanisms].
AB  == we examined antibacterial activities of 4 kinds of macrolides, erythromycin (em), clarithromycin (cam), azithromycin (azm) and rokitamycin (rkm), against 6 bacterial species of clinical strains isoleted in 2002. bacterial isolates used were each 50 strains of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae and 43 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae. s. agalactiae were derived from gynecological samples, and other species were isolated from respiratory specimens. antimicrobial activities against s. aureus,  s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, m. catarrhalis and h. influenzae of 14-membered macrolides, such as em and cam, were higher than those of 16-membered macrolide,  rkm. by contrast, against s. pneumoniae, rkm was more effective than 14-membered  macrolides. six, three and four strains of s. aureus, s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae, respectively, were resistant to macrolides. thirty-five among 43 pneumococcal isolates were resistant, and 15 of the 35 were highly-resistant, mic of > 128 micrograms/ml, to any one of em, cam or azm. isolation frequency of resistant strains to rkm was lower than those to 14- and 15-membered macrolides:  only one strain was highly-resistant and 12 were intermediately-resistant. no resistant strain was recognized in m. catarrhalis and h. influenzae. further, we  analyzed the resistant mechanisms, methylation or efflux, of macrolide resistant  strains by the double-disk method. methylation was major mechanism in s. aureus,  and in s. pyogenes, all of the resistance was caused by methylation. in s. agalactiae and s. pneumoniae, methylation and efflux shared about half and half.

TI  == comparative in vitro potency of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and four oral agents  against recent north american clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29  species isolated in the us and canada between 1997 and 1999. based upon minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. against enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general,  displayed weak activity with only proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of gram-negative non-enterobacteriaceae including haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against burkholderia cepacia, pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.
