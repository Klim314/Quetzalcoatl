TI  - Reduced Burden of Salmonella enterica in Bovine Subiliac Lymph Nodes Associated with Administration of a Direct-fed Microbial.
AB  - Despite effective food safety interventions within abattoirs, Salmonella enterica remains a common contaminant of raw ground beef. Research has recently implicated peripheral lymph nodes (PLNs) as a potential route by which Salmonella contaminates ground beef. This study examined the efficacy of using Lactobacillus animalis (formerly designated Lactobacillus acidophilus; NP51) and Propionibacterium freudenreichii (NP24), at 109 cfu/head/day, as a direct-fed microbial (DFM) in feedlot cattle diets to control Salmonella within PLNs. Two studies were conducted in which cattle were randomly allocated into either control or DFM treatment groups. Diets of treated cattle were supplemented with 109 cfu/head/day of the DFM, while control groups received no DFM supplementation. During slaughter at abattoirs, one subiliac lymph node (SLN) per carcass was collected from 627 carcasses from one study and 99 carcasses from the second study. Lymph nodes were cultured to estimate the presence and concentration of Salmonella. In the first study, effects of DFM supplementation varied across slaughter days. On the first and second slaughter days, prevalence was reduced by 50% (P = 0.0072) and 31% (P = 0.0093), respectively. No significant difference was observed on slaughter day three (P = 0.1766). In the second study, Salmonella was 82% less likely (P = 0.008) to be recovered from SLNs of treatment cattle. While a greater relative risk reduction was observed in the latter study, absolute risk reductions were similar across studies. A significant reduction in the concentration of Salmonella in SLNs (P < 0.0001) on a cfu/g and cfu/node basis was also observed in cattle administered NP51 and NP24 in the first study; in the second study, too few quantifiable SLNs were observed to facilitate meaningful comparisons. The results indicate that NP51 and NP24 supplementation may aid in reducing the prevalence and concentration of Salmonella in SLNs and, therefore, serve as an effective control measure to reduce Salmonella in ground beef products.
TI  - The use of direct-fed microbials to reduce shedding of Escherichia coli O157 in beef cattle: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
AB  - Human illness due to infections with Escherichia coli O157 is a serious health concern. Infection occurs through direct contact with infected animals or their faeces, through contaminated food or water and/or through person-to-person transmission. A reduction in faecal E. coli O157 shedding in cattle might reduce the burden of human infections. We used systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of direct-fed microbials (DFM), compared with placebo or no treatment, fed during the pre-harvest stage of production in reducing faecal E. coli O157 shedding in beef cattle during field trials. Four electronic databases, Nebraska Beef Reports and review article reference lists were searched. A total of 16 publications assessing faecal shedding at the end of the trial and/or throughout the trial period were included. The majority of publicly disseminated trials evaluated the prevalence of E. coli O157 faecal shedding; only two evaluated the concentration of organisms in faeces. The prevalence of faecal E. coli O157 shedding in cattle is significantly reduced by DFM treatments (summary effect size for all DFM - OR = 0.46; CI = 0.36-0.60). The DFM combination Lactobacillus acidophilus (NP51) and Propionibacterium freudenreichii (NP24) was more efficacious in reducing the prevalence of faecal E. coli O157 shedding at the time of harvest and throughout the trial period compared with the group of other DFM, although this difference was not statistically significant. Furthermore, we found that the combination [NP51 and NP24] treatment was more efficacious in reducing the prevalence of faecal E. coli O157 shedding at the time of harvest and throughout the trial period when fed at the dose of 10(9) CFU/animal/day than any lesser amount, although this difference was not statistically significant. Feeding beef cattle DFM during the pre-harvest stage of production reduces the prevalence of E. coli O157 faecal shedding and might effectively reduce human infections.
TI  - Variable efficacy of a vaccine and direct-fed microbial for controlling Escherichia coli O157:H7 in feces and on hides of feedlot cattle.
AB  - To evaluate the efficacy of a type-III secreted proteins vaccine and a Lactobacillus-acidophilus-based direct-fed microbial (DFM) for controlling Escherichia coli O157:H7, cattle (n=864) were allocated to the following groups: DFM, finishing diets containing 10(9) colony-forming units (CFU)/animal/day L. acidophilus and Propionibacterium freudenreichii; VAC, finishing diets and 2 mL intramuscular injection of vaccine at allocation and 28 days later; or CON, finishing diets only. Cattle within replicates were stratified by initial levels of E. coli O157:H7 and randomized to experimental groups, with 30 pens allocated on June 15, 2011 (AS1), 18 pens allocated on June 28, 2011 (AS2), and 18 cattle per pen. Rectal fecal samples and perineal swabs were collected at 28-day intervals until shipment to slaughter (103-145 days on trial). Numbers of cattle with enumerable E. coli O157:H7 (>/=1.6 CFU/g feces) were reduced in AS1 and AS2 by VAC (p=0.008), although interventions had no impact on numbers of E. coli O157:H7 shed. For AS1, VAC reduced prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 in feces (p=0.03) and perineal swabs (p=0.04) in the feeding period but not at shipment to slaughter. For AS2, prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 was not reduced in either feces or perineal swabs by VAC at any time. For AS1, DFM reduced prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 in perineal swabs (p=0.01) during the feeding period. For AS2, DFM increased E. coli O157:H7 detection in feces (p=0.03) and perineal swabs (p=0.01) at shipment to slaughter. Seventy-five percent of AS1 E. coli O157:H7 isolates had only stx1, while 87% of AS2 isolates had stx1 and stx2 genes. Of the two interventions, VAC shows the most potential for pre-harvest control of E. coli O157:H7, but due to variable efficacy of both DFM and VAC, additional product development is necessary to ensure more consistent pre-harvest control of E. coli O157:H7.
TI  - Escherichia coli O26 in feedlot cattle: fecal prevalence, isolation, characterization, and effects of an E. coli O157 vaccine and a direct-fed microbial.
AB  - Escherichia coli O26 is second only to O157 in causing foodborne, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) infections. Our objectives were to determine fecal prevalence and characteristics of E. coli O26 in commercial feedlot cattle (17,148) that were enrolled in a study to evaluate an E. coli O157:H7 siderophore receptor and porin (SRP((R))) vaccine (VAC) and a direct-fed microbial (DFM; 10(6) colony-forming units [CFU]/animal/day of Lactobacillus acidophilus and 10(9) CFU/animal/day of Propionibacterium freudenreichii). Cattle were randomly allocated to 40 pens within 10 complete blocks; pens were randomly assigned to control, VAC, DFM, or VAC+DFM treatments. Vaccine was administered on days 0 and 21, and DFM was fed throughout the study. Pen-floor fecal samples (30/pen) were collected weekly for the last 4 study weeks. Samples were enriched in E. coli broth and subjected to a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) designed to detect O26-specific wzx gene and four major virulence genes (stx1, stx2, eae, and ehxA) and to a culture-based procedure that involved immunomagnetic separation and plating on MacConkey agar. Ten presumptive E. coli colonies were randomly picked, pooled, and tested by the multiplex PCR. Pooled colonies positive for O26 serogroup were streaked on sorbose MacConkey agar, and 10 randomly picked colonies per sample were tested individually by the multiplex PCR. The overall prevalence of E. coli O26 was higher (p<0.001) by the culture-based method compared to the PCR assay (22.7 versus 10.5%). The interventions (VAC and or DFM) had no impact on fecal shedding of O26. Serogroup O26 was recovered in pure culture from 23.9% (260 of 1089) of O26 PCR-positive pooled colonies. Only 7 of the 260 isolates were positive for the stx gene and 90.1% of the isolates possessed an eaebeta gene that codes for intimin subtype beta, but not the bfpA gene, which codes for bundle-forming pilus. Therefore, the majority of the O26 recovered from feedlot cattle feces was atypical enteropathogenic E. coli, and not STEC.
TI  - Role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  - Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. Following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285((R)) and Lactobacillus casei LBC80R((R)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical MRSA isolates, we conducted a literature search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment of S. aureus infection. As summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of S. aureus and clinical isolates of MRSA in vitro. The most active strains were Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Propionibacterium freudenreichii, Propionibacterium acnes, Lactobacillus paracasei, L. acidophilus, L. casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactococcus lactis. Their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. L. acidophilus also inhibited S. aureus biofilm formation and lipase production. In vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. S. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in vitro to L. acidophilus, whilst in vivo Bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. On the other hand, L. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against S. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with S. aureus in mice. Very few clinical data were found on the interactions between probiotics and MRSA, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of MRSA colonisation with probiotic use.
TI  - Effects of the addition of direct-fed microbials and glycerol to the diet of lactating dairy cows on milk yield and apparent efficiency of yield.
AB  - A study was conducted to evaluate the effects of a direct-fed microbial (M) and dietary glycerol (G) on milk yield, efficiency of yield, and nutrient digestibility during hot weather. Sixty Holstein cows averaging 120 d in milk (DIM) and 36.2 kg/d of milk were used in a 12-wk 2x2 factorial design trial from June through September 2008. Cows were fed a common diet during the 2-wk standardization period and were blocked by milk yield, DIM, parity, and dry matter intake. Diets were based on corn and ryegrass silages and balanced to be isocaloric and isonitrogenous. Treatments included a negative control (M- or G-), 4 x 10(9) cfu/head of a combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus NP51 and Propionibacterium freudenreichii NP24 (M+), control plus 400 g/h per day of 99% pure food-grade glycerol (G+), and 4x10(9) cfu/h per day of a combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus NP51 and Propionibacterium freudenreichii NP24 plus 400 g/h per day of 99% pure food-grade glycerol (MG++). No interactions were observed between direct-fed microbials and dietary glycerol in the study except on apparent nutrient digestibility. No differences were observed in dry matter intake, which averaged 22.7, 23.1, 23.4, and 22.9 for M-, G-, M+, and G+, respectively. Milk yield was increased for M+ compared with M- at 34.1 and 31.7 kg/d, but G+ had no effect on yield. No treatment effect was noted for milk fat percentage or milk protein percentage among diets. Milk protein yield was higher for M+ compared with M- at 0.93 versus 0.87 kg/d. Energy-corrected milk was improved for the M+ versus M- groups at 33.5 and 31.6 kg/d, respectively. No differences in respiratory rate, skin temperature, body temperature, or concentrations of serum glucose or urea N were observed among treatments. Improvement in apparent digestibility was observed with M+ and G+ compared with M-/G- in this experiment. The addition of a direct-fed microbial alone improved milk and protein yield, energy-corrected milk, and apparent digestibility of crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, and acid detergent fiber, and the inclusion of glycerol (G+) had a positive effect on apparent dry matter and acid detergent fiber digestibility compared with M-/G-. The addition of a direct-fed microbial and dietary glycerol may improve yield and digestibility for cows subject to heat stress.
TI  - Effects of increasing dose of live cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus (Strain  NP 51) combined with a single dose of Propionibacterium freudenreichii (Strain NP 24) on performance and carcass characteristics of finishing beef steers.
AB  - Two experiments, each with a randomized complete block design, were conducted to  evaluate the effects of feeding live cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus plus Propionibacterium freudenreichii on performance and carcass characteristics of feedlot cattle. British and British x Continental steers (240 steers in each experiment; 12 pens/treatment in each study; average initial BW = 370 +/- 6 kg) were fed a 92% concentrate diet based primarily on steam-flaked corn. Four treatments were evaluated, which included a control diet (lactose carrier only) or diets containing 1 x 10(9) cfu/(steer x d) of P. freudenreichii (strain NP 24) with 1 x 10(7) (L), 1 x 10(8) (M), or 1 x 10(9) (H) cfu of L. acidophilus strain NP 51/(steer x d). Data were pooled for the 2 experiments. No differences (P > 0.10) were detected among treatments for final BW, final BW based on HCW, or DMI during various stages of the feeding period or overall. Likewise, no differences among treatments were observed for either ADG or carcass-adjusted ADG (P > 0.10), except for the tendency for a quadratic effect of NP 51 dose for the overall feeding period (P = 0.10), in which cattle fed M had a lower ADG than those fed L and H. Gain efficiency on a live BW basis was improved (P = 0.02) by NP 51 treatments compared with the control, with G:F responding quadratically to NP 51 dose for the overall feeding period (P = 0.05). In contrast to G:F based on live BW, carcass-adjusted G:F tended (P = 0.14) to decrease linearly with increasing NP 51 dose because the dressing percent tended (P = 0.12) to be less for steers fed direct-fed microbial compared with control cattle. Within the direct-fed microbial treatments, there also was a tendency (P = 0.13) for a linear decrease in the dressing percent as the NP 51 dose increased. No differences were observed in other carcass characteristics (P > 0.10), except tendencies for a quadratic increase in marbling score (P = 0.11) and percentage of USDA Choice cattle (P = 0.10). These data indicate that live cultures of L. acidophilus strain NP 51 plus P. freudenreichii strain NP 24 increased G:F of feedlot cattle fed steam-flaked corn-based diets by approximately 2%, but the effects depended on the dose of Lactobacillus.
TI  - Reduction of Escherichia coli O157 and Salmonella in feces and on hides of feedlot cattle using various doses of a direct-fed microbial.
AB  - In this study, the effectiveness of direct-fed microbials at reducing Escherichia coli O157 and Salmonella in beef cattle was evaluated. Steers (n=240) received one of the following four treatment concentrations: control = lactose carrier only; low = 1 X 10(7) CFU per steer daily Lactobacillus acidophilus NP51; medium = 5 x 10(8) CFU per steer daily L. acidophilus NP51; and high = 1 x 10(9) CFU per steer daily L. acidophilus NP51. Low, medium, and high diets also included 1 x 10(9) CFU per steer Propionibacterium freudenreichii NP24. Feces were collected from each animal at allocation of treatment and found to have no variation (P = 0.54) between cohorts concerning E. coli O157 recovery. Feces and hide swabs were collected at harvest and analyzed for the presence of E. coli O157 by immunomagnetic separation and Salmonella by PCR. No significant dosing effects were detected for E. coli O157 recovery from feces at the medium dose or from hides at the medium and high doses. E. coli O157 was 74% (P < 0.01) and 69% (P < 0.01) less likely to be recovered in feces from animals receiving the high and low diets, respectively, compared with controls. Compared with controls, E. coli O157 was 74% (P = 0.05) less likely to be isolated on hides of cattle receiving the low dose. No significant dosing effects were detected for Salmonella recovery from feces at the medium and low doses or from hides at any doses. Compared with controls, Salmonella was 48% (P = 0.09) less likely to be shed in feces of cattle receiving the high dose. No obvious dose-response of L. acidophilus NP51 on recovery of E. coli O157 or Salmonella was detected in our study.
TI  - Pre-harvest interventions to reduce the shedding of E. coli O157 in the faeces of weaned domestic ruminants: a systematic review.
AB  - Our objective was to use formal systematic review methods to evaluate the efficacy of interventions to reduce faecal shedding of Escherichia coli O157 in post-weaned ruminants by increasing animal resistance. The methodology consisted of an extensive search to identify all potentially relevant research, screening of titles and abstracts for relevance to the research question, quality assessment of relevant research, extraction of data from research of sufficient quality, and qualitative summarization of results. The interventions evaluated included probiotics, vaccination, antimicrobials, sodium chlorate, bacteriophages and other feed additives. There was evidence of efficacy for the probiotic combination Lactobacillus acidophilus NP51 (NPC 747) and Propionibacterium freudenreichii and for sodium chlorate in feed or water. The effectiveness of vaccination varied among studies and among vaccine protocols and there was no consistent evidence to suggest that antibiotic use was associated with a decrease in faecal shedding of E. coli O157, or that current industry uses of antimicrobials were associated with increased faecal shedding. There were an insufficient number of studies available to address the effectiveness of bacteriophages and several other feed additives. In general, few of the primary studies evaluated the interventions under commercial housing conditions with a natural disease challenge, there were inconsistencies in the results among study designs and in some cases among studies within study designs, and a relatively large proportion of publications were excluded based on quality assessment criteria. Few studies reported on associations between the proposed intervention and production parameters, such as average daily gain and feed: gain ratio. While the results suggest that some interventions may be efficacious, there are knowledge gaps in our understanding of the efficacy of pre-harvest interventions to increase animal resistance to E. coli O157 that require further targeted research.
TI  - Effect of direct-fed microbials on performance, diet digestibility, and rumen characteristics of Holstein dairy cows.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the effect of feeding direct-fed microbial (DFM) products containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Propionibacteria freudenreichii on the performance, nutrient digestibility, and rumen fermentation of Holstein dairy cows in midlactation. Experiments were conducted from February to May 2003. Cows were fed 1 of 3 dietary treatments: 1) 1 x 10(9) colony-forming units (cfu)/d of live L. acidophilus strain LA747 and 2 x 10(9) cfu/d of live P. freudenreichii strain PF24 (DFM1); 2) 1 x 10(9) cfu/d of live L. acidophilus strain LA747, 2 x 10(9) cfu/d of live P. freudenreichii strain PF24, and 5 x 10(8) cfu/d of L. acidophilus strain LA45 (DFM2); or 3) lactose (control). Treatments were administered by mixing 45 g of finely ground corn with 5 g of DFM products or lactose and top dressing on the total mixed rations once daily. All cows received the same total mixed ration: 12.7% alfalfa hay, 46.2% corn silage, and 41.1% concentrate on a dry matter (DM) basis. In study 1 (lactation study), 39 multiparous and 18 primiparous Holstein cows were blocked by parity and randomly assigned to treatments for 84 d. Starting on d 35, fecal grab samples were collected from each cow at 5- to 8-h intervals over 48 h for digestibility measurements. A rumen fermentation study (study 2) was conducted concurrently with the lactation study. Three rumenfistulated, multiparous Holstein cows were randomly assigned to dietary treatments DFM1, DFM2, and control in a 3 x 3 Latin square design with 28-d periods. In study 1, there was no difference in average DM intake (23.9, 23.6, and 24.2 kg/d) or 4% fat-corrected milk (36.8, 35.3, and 36.2 kg/d) for treatments DFM1, DFM2, and control. Percentage or yield of milk components also did not differ among treatments. Feed efficiency averaged 1.52 kg of 4% fat-corrected milk/kg of DM intake and did not differ among treatments. There were no differences in apparent DM, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, or starch digestibility among treatments. In study 2, there was no difference in rumen pH and concentrations of ammonia or total volatile fatty acids measured at 0, 1, 3, and 6 h after feeding. Under the conditions of these studies, supplementing midlactation cows with DFM products containing L. acidophilus and P. freudenreichii did not affect cow performance, diet digestibility, or rumen fermentation.
TI  - Production of Propionibacterium shermanii biomass and vitamin B12 on spent media.
AB  - AIMS: The propionibacteria are commercially important due to their use in the cheese industry, and there is a growing interest for their probiotic effects. Stimulatory effects of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on propionic acid bacteria have been observed. This study was designed to examine the possibility of using spent media previously used to grow LAB for the production of biomass and metabolites of Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventeen MRS and vegetable juice media were prefermented by various LAB and evaluated for their ability to subsequently support the growth of Propionibacterium, using automated spectrophotometry (AS). Growth of Propionibacterium in spent media was strongly affected by the LAB strain used to produce the spent medium. The native MRS medium (not prefermented) yielded the highest optical density values followed by prefermented media by Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium longum and Lactococcus lactis. Prefermented cabbage juice enabled good growth of Propionibacterium. For the production of organic acids and vitamin B12, cells of Propionibacterium were concentrated and immobilized in alginate beads in the aim of accelerating the bioconversions. More propionic acid was obtained in spent media than in native MRS. The concentration of vitamin B12 was higher in media fermented with free cells than those with immobilized cultures; with the free cells, its concentration varied from 900 to 1800 ng ml(-1) of media. CONCLUSIONS: It was demonstrated that spent media could be recycled for the production of Propionibacterium and metabolites, depending on the LAB strain that was previously grown. Media remediation is needed to improve the production of vitamin B12, especially with immobilized cells. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study presents an option for recycling of spent media generated by producers of LAB or producers of fermented vegetables. The propionic fermentation may result in three commercial products: biomass, vitamin B12 or organic acids, which may be used as starters, supplements or food preservatives. It is an attractive process from economical and environmental standpoints.
TI  - Reduction of Escherichia coli O157 in finishing beef cattle by various doses of Lactobacillus acidophilus in direct-fed microbials.
AB  - Our objective was to evaluate the effects of three doses of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain NP51 and a combination treatment of strains NP51 and NP45 on prevalence of Escherichia coli O157 in cattle. Three hundred steers were assigned randomly to 60 pens (five steers per pen) and received one of five treatments: (i) control, no added direct-fed microbial; (ii) HNP51, high dose of NP51 at 10(9) CFU per steer daily; (iii) MNP51, NP51 at 10(8) CFU per steer daily; (iv) LNP51, low dose of NP51 at 10(7) CFU per steer daily; and (v) NP51+45, NP51 at 10(9) CFU per steer daily and NP45 at 106 CFU per steer daily. All direct-fed microbial treatments included Propionibacterium freudenreichii at 10(9) CFU per steer. Individual rectal fecal samples were collected on arrival and every 28 days throughout the feeding period. Fecal and hide samples were collected on the day of harvest. Samples were analyzed for presence of E. coli O157 using immunomagnetic separation methods. Cattle receiving HNP51, MNP51, and LNP51 had a lower prevalence (P < 0.01) of E. coli O157 throughout the feeding period compared with the controls, and the dose response for NP51 was a linear decrease in prevalence with increasing dose (P < 0.01). No decrease in prevalence for cattle receiving the combination NP51+45 was detected compared with controls (P = 0.15). E. coli O157 prevalences averaged across collection times were 23.9, 10.5, 9.9, 6.8, and 17.3% for cattle in the control, LNP51, MNP51, HNP51, and NP51 +45 groups, respectively. Least squares mean estimates of fecal prevalence at harvest of E. coli O157 were 31.7, 12.5, 17.4, 8.2, and 41.6% among cattle in the control, LNP51, MNP51, HNP51, and NP51+45 groups, respectively. Least squares mean estimates of the percentage of positive hide samples at harvest were 8.7, 5.9, 4.8, 3.4, and 8.6% among cattle in the control, LNP51, MNP51, HNP51, and NP51+45 groups, respectively. The greatest decrease in E. coli O157 carriage was achieved using NP51 at 10(9) CFU per steer.
TI  - Dietary supplementation with Lactobacillus- and Propionibacterium-based direct-fed microbials and prevalence of Escherichia coli O157 in beef feedlot cattle and on hides at harvest.
AB  - The objective of this study was to describe the prevalence of Escherichia coli O157 in the feces and on the hides of finishing beef cattle fed a standard diet and those fed diets supplemented with direct-fed microbials. Two hundred forty steers received one of four treatments throughout the feeding period: (i) control: no added microbials; (ii) HNP51: high dose of Lactohacillius acidophilus strain NP 51 (10(9) CFU per steer daily) and Propionibacterium freudenreichii (10(9) CFU per steer daily); (iii) HNP51+45: high dose of NP 51 (10(9) CFU per steer daily), P. freudenreichii (10(9) CFU per steer daily), and L. acidophilus NP 45 (10(6) CFU per steer daily); or (iv) LNP51+45: low dose of NP 51 (10(6) CFU per steer daily), P. freudenreichii (10(9) CFU per steer daily), and NP 45 (10(6) CFU per steer daily). Samples were collected from each animal and analyzed for the presence of E. coli O157 using immunomagnetic separation methods on day 0 (feces), 7 days before harvest (feces), and at harvest (feces and hide). At the end of the feeding period, cattle receiving HNP51 were 57% less likely to shed detectable E. coli O157 in their feces than were the controls (P < 0.01). For animals receiving HNP51+45 and LNP51+45, fecal prevalence did not differ from that of the controls. The prevalence of positive hide samples was least among cattle receiving HNP51+45 (3.3%); these animals were 79% less likely (P < 0.06) to have a positive hide sample than were the controls (prevalence = 13.8%). There was poor agreement of the culture results between fecal and hide samples collected from the same animal (kappa = 0.08; confidence interval = -0.05 to 0.2). Cattle supplemented with a high dose of NP 51 had reduced E. coli O157 prevalence in both fecal and hide samples, indicating that this treatment may be an efficacious preharvest intervention strategy.
TI  - Effects of live cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus (strains NP45 and NP51) and Propionibacterium freudenreichii on performance, carcass, and intestinal characteristics, and Escherichia coli strain O157 shedding of finishing beef steers.
AB  - In Exp. 1, 240 beef steers (initial BW = 332.8 kg) were used to determine the effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) plus Propionibacterium freudenreichii (PF) on performance, carcass, and intestinal characteristics; serum IgA concentrations; and the prevalence of Escherichia coli O157 (EC). Cattle were fed a steam-flaked corn-based, 92% concentrate diet, and the four direct-fed microbial (DFM) treatments (12 pens/treatment) included in a randomized complete block design were as follows: 1) control, lactose carrier only (CON); 2) 1 x 10(9) cfu of LA NP51 plus 1 x 10(6) cfu of LA NP45 plus 1 x 10(9) cfu of PF NP24 per animal daily (LA45-51H); 3) 1 x 10(9) cfu of LA NP51 plus 1 x 10(9) cfu of PF NP24 per animal daily (LA51); and 4) 1 x 10(6) cfu of LA NP51 plus 1 x 10(6) cfu of LA NP45 plus 1 x 10(9) cfu of PF NP24 per animal daily (LA45-51L). No differences (P > 0.10) were detected for pen-based performance data. The average lamina propria thickness for LA51 and LA45-51H steers was less (P = 0.02) than the average for CON and LA45-51L steers. Moreover, LA51 and LA45-51H steers had a lower (P = 0.06) prevalence of EC shedding than CON and LA45-51L steers. In Exp. 2, 660 steers fed 91% concentrate, steam-flaked corn-based diets were used to determine the effects of the following DFM treatments (10 pens/treatment) on performance, carcass, and intestinal characteristics: 1) control, lactose carrier only (CON); 2) 5 x 10(6) cfu of LA NP51 plus 5 x 10(6) cfu of LA NP45 plus 1 x 10(9) cfu of PF NP24 per animal daily (LA45-51L); and 3) 1 x 10(9) cfu of LA NP51 plus 5 x 10(6) cfu of LA NP45 plus 1 x 10(9) cfu of PF NP24 per animal daily (LA45-51H). Steers were from two weight groups (WG). One group (SDOF; BW at arrival = 351.5 kg) had grazed before arrival, and the other group (LDOF; BW at arrival = 314 kg) had been in a grower yard. A split plot was used with WG as the whole-plot factor and DFM in the split plot. There was an interaction of WG and DFM for ADG (P = 0.05) and for carcass-adjusted ADG (P = 0.08). The simple-effect ADG and carcass-adjusted ADG means for DFM treatments differed (P < or = 0.01) between WG classifications. Within SDOF, ADG for CON and LA45-51L did not differ (P = 0.70), but both were less (P < or = 0.08) than for LA45-51H. Overall, these data indicate that live cultures of LA plus PF did not greatly affect feedlot performance and carcass characteristics. Some of the DFM used decreased fecal EC shedding, which might be related to the results for ileal lamina propria thickness.
TI  - Human ileostomy glycoproteins as a model for small intestinal mucus to investigate adhesion of probiotics.
AB  - Human ileostomy glycoproteins were used as a model for small intestinal mucus to  investigate the adhesion of 12 Lactobacillus strains, one Lactococcus strain and one Propionibacterium strain, Both probiotic and dairy strains were tested. Adhesive and non-adhesive Escherichia coli strains were used as controls. All the strains were also tested for their adhesion to polystyrene. Adhesion to ileostomy glycoproteins and to polystyrene varied significantly among the strains tested. Lactobacillus rhamnosus (human isolate), Lactobacillus GG, Lact. acidophilus 1 and P. freudenreichii adhered to ileostomy glycoproteins. Adhesion was concentration-dependent and the most adhesive strains were able to saturate the substratum. These results indicate that human ileostomy glycoproteins can be used as a model system to select potential probiotic strains to complement the adhesion test with intestinal cell lines.
