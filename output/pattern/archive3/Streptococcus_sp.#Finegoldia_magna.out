an in vitro comparison of two silver-containing antimicrobial wound dressings .
preclinical studies have shown that release of silver by different wound dressings varies. the purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the antimicrobial activity of silver alginate (sa) and silver carboxymethylcellulose (scm) dressings. an- timicrobial activity was tested using nine bacterial strains with log10 reduction and corrected zone of inhibition (czoi) as- says. antimicrobial effect was visualized using confocal microscopy (clsm). log10 reduction was comparable between both dressings for staphylococcus aureus ncimb 9518, candida albicans atcc 90028, finegoldia magna nctc 11804t, and pseudomonas aeruginosa nctc 10662. log10 reduction was higher for scm than sa dressing-exposed escherichia coli (p = 0.035) and p. aeruginosa atcc 15692 (p = 0.032), and lower for scm than sa dressing-exposed streptococcus pyogenes (p = 0.007), peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus (p = 0.045), and s. aureus nctc 8325 (p = 0.012). both dressings were equivalent against four strains (5 to 8 days' activity) in the czoi assay. sa dressing silver activity lasted >24 hours longer than scm activity when exposed to c. albicans (9 days' activity), e. coli (7 days' activity), f. magna (5 days' activity), and p. asaccharolyticus (5 days' activity), whereas the smc exhibited greater persistence against s. pyogenes (13 days' activity). clsm showed complete kill of s. aureus after 20 hours for both dressings. the results of this study confirm the broad-spectrum, in vitro activity of some dressings containing ionic silver. the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of both wound dressings was comparable, but clinical studies comparing the efficacy and effectiveness of silver-containing dressings to nonionic silver-containing dressings are needed.
constitutive and inflammation-dependent antimicrobial peptides produced by epithelium are differentially processed and inactivated by the commensal finegoldia magna and the pathogen streptococcus pyogenes.
epithelial linings serve as physical barriers and produce antimicrobial peptides  (amps) to maintain host integrity. examples are the bactericidal proteins midkine (mk) and brak/cxcl14 that are constitutively produced in the skin epidermal layer, where the anaerobic gram-positive coccoid commensal finegoldia magna resides. consequently, this bacterium is likely to encounter both mk and brak/cxcl14, making these molecules possible threats to its habitat. in this study, we show that mk expression is upregulated during inflammation, concomitant with a strong downregulation of brak/cxcl14, resulting in changed antibacterial conditions. mk, brak/cxcl14, and the inflammation-dependent antimicrobial beta-defensins human beta-defensin (hbd)-2 and hbd-3 all showed bactericidal activity against both f. magna and the virulent pathogen streptococcus pyogenes at similar concentrations. sufa, a released protease of f. magna, degraded mk and brak/cxcl14 but not hbd-2 nor hbd-3. cleavage was seen at lysine and arginine residues, amino acids characteristic of amps. intermediate sufa-degraded fragments of mk and brak/cxcl14 showed stronger bactericidal activity against s. pyogenes than f. magna, thus promoting survival of the latter. in contrast, the cysteine-protease speb of s. pyogenes rapidly degraded all amps investigated. the proteins faf and sic, released by f. magna and s. pyogenes, respectively, neutralized the antibacterial activity of mk and brak/cxcl14, protein faf being the most efficient. quantitation and colocalization by immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated significant levels and interactions of the molecules in in vivo and ex vivo samples. the findings reflect strategies used by a permanently residing commensal and a virulent pathogen, the latter operating during the limited time course of invasive disease.
sufa of the opportunistic pathogen finegoldia magna modulates actions of the antibacterial chemokine mig/cxcl9, promoting bacterial survival during epithelial inflammation.
the anaerobic bacterium finegoldia magna is part of the human commensal microbiota, but is also an important opportunistic pathogen. this bacterium expresses a subtilisin-like serine proteinase, sufa, which partially degrade the antibacterial chemokine mig/cxcl9. here, we show that mig/cxcl9 is produced by human keratinocytes in response to inflammatory stimuli. in contrast to the virulent human pathogen streptococcus pyogenes, the presence of f. magna had no enhancing effect on the mig/cxcl9 expression by keratinocytes, suggesting poor detection of the latter by pathogen-recognition receptors. when mig/cxcl9 was exposed to sufa-expressing f. magna, the molecule was processed into several smaller fragments. analysis by mass spectrometry showed that sufa cleaves mig/cxcl9 at several sites in the cooh-terminal region of the molecule. at equimolar concentrations, sufa-generated mig/cxcl9 fragments were not bactericidal against f. magna, but retained their ability to kill s. pyogenes. moreover, the sufa-generated mig/cxcl9 fragments were capable of activating the angiostasis-mediating cxcr3 receptor, which is expressed on endothelial cells, in an order of magnitude similar to that of intact mig/cxcl9. f. magna expresses a surface protein called faf that is released from the bacterial surface by sufa. soluble faf was found to bind and inactivate the antibacterial activity of mig/cxcl9, thereby further potentially promoting the survival of f. magna. the findings suggest that sufa modulation of the inflammatory response could be a mechanism playing an important role in creating an ecologic niche for f. magna, decreasing antibacterial activity and suppressing angiogenesis, thus providing advantage in survival for this anaerobic opportunist compared with competing pathogens during inflammation.
