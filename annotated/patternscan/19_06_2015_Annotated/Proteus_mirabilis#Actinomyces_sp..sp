TI  == microbiological profile of orbital abscess.
AB  == background: knowledge of the culture and sensitivity pattern is necessary, for the institution of appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy in orbital abscess. objective: the objective of this study is to describe culture and sensitivity patterns of specimens from the orbit and surrounding structures. materials and methods: retrospectively the medical records of 56 cases of orbital abscess were  reviewed. results: cultures were positive in 38/56 (68.8%) orbital specimens and  the organisms included staphylococcus aureus 18, streptococci 7, pseudomonas aeruginosa 3, 2 each of enterobactersp, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, acinetobacter sp. and 1 each of actinomyces israelii, diptheroids, coagulase negative staphylococcus, citrobacter freundii, methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. four had polymicrobial infection. culture of purulent  nasal discharge, swabs taken from foci of infection on the face, and blood cultures were done in 26/56, and positive cultures were obtained in 16/26 (61.5%) specimens. in 12 patients, there was a concurrence in the organism cultured from  the orbit and from cultures from other sites. gram-negative organisms were associated with increased ocular morbidity. conclusion: gram-positive cocci, especially s. aureus are the most common organisms isolated from orbital abscesses. infections by gram-negative organisms were associated with more complications. empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy should have a broad spectrum of activity effective against a wide range of staphylococcal organisms and gram-negative bacilli.

TI  == isolation of bacteriophages from the oral cavity.
AB  == aims: to isolate bacteriophages lytic for oral pathogens from human saliva, dental plaque and mature biofilms constituted from saliva-derived bacteria. methods and results: saliva and dental plaque samples from healthy volunteers and from patients with gingivitis and periodontitis were examined for the presence of lytic bacteriophage using a panel of oral pathogens and bacteria isolated from the samples. samples were also enriched for bacteriophage using static culture techniques and mature biofilms. a limited number of samples contained bacteriophage particles that were visualized using electron microscopy. cultures  yielded phage infecting non-oral bacteria (proteus mirabilis) but no bacteriophage specific for recognized oral pathogens were found. some micro-organisms from the oral microflora elaborated antibacterial substances that inhibited growth of other residents of the oral cavity. conclusions: unlike other ecosystems, the composition of the oral cavity does not appear to be heavily influenced by interactions between bacteriophages and their hosts. significance and impact of the study: bacteriophage for control of oral infections may need to be obtained from other sources. antibacterial substances derived from some members of the oral microflora warrant investigation as potential antibiotics.

TI  == bacterial flora of the uterus of cows after calving on two hygienically contrasting farms.
AB  == intrauterine swabs were obtained from cows after calving on two commercial dairy  herds with contrasting hygienic environments and incidence of leucorrhea, and cultured aerobically and anaerobically. of 26 cows with a normal calving and puerperium, eight of 14 (57 per cent) were sterile on farm b where hygiene was poor, compared with five of 12 (42 per cent) on farm a where hygiene was better.  two cows on farm b retained their placentas and subsequently developed metritis/endometritis. actinomyces pyogenes was the commonest bacterial isolate and fusobacterium nucleatum, proteus mirabilis and bacteroides melaninogenicus were also frequently observed. similar isolates were obtained from cows on farm b with parturient or puerperal disorders. the contrasting hygienic environments had no influence on either the quantitative or qualitative uterine bacterial flora. thus, the difference in the incidence of endometritis must have been due to factors other than hygiene.

TI  == further observations on enhancement of the infectivity of fusobacterium necrophorum by other bacteria.
AB  == it had already been shown with a single virulent strain (a42) of fusobacterium necrophorum that suspension of the fusobacteria in sub-lethal doses of broth cultures of other bacteria reduced the minimum infective dose (greater than 10(6) organisms) for mice by subcutaneous inoculation, sometimes to less than 10 organisms. the present study extended the known range of bacteria with strong infectivity-enhancing properties to include bacillus cereus, klebsiella oxytoca and staphylococcus aureus; and those with weaker effect to include bacillus subtilis, 'bacteroides melaninogenicus', clostridium sporogenes, pasteurella haemolytica, and proteus mirabilis. the study also showed that five further virulent strains of f. necrophorum closely resembled a42 in respect of striking susceptibility to infectivity enhancement by escherichia coli. actinomyces (corynebacterium) pyogenes and s. aureus. one further strain (a6) of f. necrophorum resembled a42 in respect of strong infectivity enhancement by a. pyogenes, s. aureus, b. cereus and k. oxytoca but differed from it and the other  five strains in being only slightly affected by e. coli. this work was a necessary prelude to the development of a method, based on infectivity enhancement, for the detection and isolation of f. necrophorum present in small numbers in heavily contaminated material such as faeces.

TI  == root canal microflora: qualitative changes after endodontic instrumentation.
AB  == the changes in the pattern of bacteria in root canal after repeated washing with  naocl and endodontic instrumentation were evaluated. samples were obtained from the root canals of patients before and after endodontic instrumentation, and analyzed according to the usual microbiological techniques. washing with naocl and endodontic instrumentation act against bacteria such as peptostreptococci, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces israelii, proteus mirabilis, bacteroides, whereas streptococcus lactis and aerococcus were present before and after endodontic instrumentation. environmental conditions such as low ph could be responsible for the persistence of gram-positive bacteria. the use of topical treatment and the associated endodontic instrumentation seem useful in the eradication of some bacteria in the root canal.
