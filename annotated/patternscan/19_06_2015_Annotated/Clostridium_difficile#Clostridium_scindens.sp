TI  == dysfunctional families: clostridium scindens and secondary bile acids inhibit the growth of clostridium difficile.
AB  == c. difficile infection is a deadly disease that is influenced by the microbiome.  in a recent article in nature, buffie et al. (2014) demonstrate that the ability  of c. scindens to synthesize secondary bile acids is crucial to providing resistance to c. difficile infection.

TI  == precision microbiome reconstitution restores bile acid mediated resistance to clostridium difficile.
AB  == the gastrointestinal tracts of mammals are colonized by hundreds of microbial species that contribute to health, including colonization resistance against intestinal pathogens. many antibiotics destroy intestinal microbial communities and increase susceptibility to intestinal pathogens. among these, clostridium difficile, a major cause of antibiotic-induced diarrhoea, greatly increases morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. which intestinal bacteria provide resistance to c. difficile infection and their in vivo inhibitory mechanisms remain unclear. here we correlate loss of specific bacterial taxa with development of infection, by treating mice with different antibiotics that result in distinct microbiota changes and lead to varied susceptibility to c. difficile. mathematical modelling augmented by analyses of the microbiota of hospitalized patients identifies resistance-associated bacteria common to mice and humans. using these platforms, we determine that clostridium scindens, a bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylating intestinal bacterium, is associated with resistance to c.  difficile infection and, upon administration, enhances resistance to infection in a secondary bile acid dependent fashion. using a workflow involving mouse models, clinical studies, metagenomic analyses, and mathematical modelling, we identify a probiotic candidate that corrects a clinically relevant microbiome deficiency. these findings have implications for the rational design of targeted antimicrobials as well as microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics for individuals at risk of c. difficile infection.

TI  == inhibiting the initiation of clostridium difficile spore germination using analogs of chenodeoxycholic acid, a bile acid.
AB  == to cause disease, clostridium difficile spores must germinate in the host gastrointestinal tract. germination is initiated upon exposure to glycine and certain bile acids, e.g., taurocholate. chenodeoxycholate, another bile acid, inhibits taurocholate-mediated germination. by applying michaelis-menten kinetic  analysis to c. difficile spore germination, we found that chenodeoxycholate is a  competitive inhibitor of taurocholate-mediated germination and appears to interact with the spores with greater apparent affinity than does taurocholate. we also report that several analogs of chenodeoxycholate are even more effective  inhibitors. some of these compounds resist 7alpha-dehydroxylation by clostridium  scindens, a core member of the normal human colonic microbiota, suggesting that they are more stable than chenodeoxycholate in the colonic environment.
