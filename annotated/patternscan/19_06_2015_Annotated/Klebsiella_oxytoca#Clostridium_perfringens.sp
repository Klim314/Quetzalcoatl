TI  == evaluation of a rapid colorimetric assay for detection of bacterial contamination in apheresis and pooled random-donor platelet units.
AB  == background: despite existing strategies, bacterial contamination of platelets (plts) remains a problem, and reliable testing near the time of use is needed. we evaluated the bactx assay (immunetics, inc.), a rapid colorimetric assay for detection of bacterial peptidoglycan, for this purpose. study design and methods: apheresis- and whole blood-derived plt units, the latter tested in 6-unit pools,  inoculated with 10 representative bacterial species (eight aerobic, two anaerobic), were tested with the bactx assay at two sites to determine analytic sensitivity and time to detection. specificity on sterile plts and reproducibility across different plt units and assay kit lots was also determined. results: analytical sensitivity for the 10 bacterial species ranged from 6.3 x 10(2) to 7.6 x 10(4) colony-forming units (cfus)/ml. in time-to-detection studies after inoculation of plts with 0.7 to 5.3 cfus/ml, 10 replicates of all eight aerobic species were positive when bacterial titers were  above the analytic sensitivity detection limit, which occurred at 48 hours for 60 plt units and at 72 hours for the remaining 4 units, as well as at 7 days for all units. specificity was 99.8% and reproducibility was 100%. conclusions: the bactx assay had an analytical sensitivity below the 10(5) cfus/ml threshold of clinical significance, detected all eight aerobic bacterial species 48 to 72 hours after inoculation as well as at 7 days, and had high specificity and reproducibility. these findings suggest that the bactx assay will be a valuable test for detection of clinically relevant levels of bacterial contaminants in plt units and pools near time of use.

TI  == [nosocomial diarrhea in intensive care unit: other than clostridium difficile].
AB  == objective: to investigate the incidence and clinical features of non-clostridium  difficile (c. difficile) associated nosocomial diarrhea in intensive care unit (icu) caused by klebsiella oxytoca and clostridium perfringens. methods: the faeces of 102 patients with non-c. difficile associated nosocomial diarrhea in icu of west china hospital, were collected during april to november, 2012. the target bacterial genes were detected by pcr amplification and sequencing, including toxic gene pehx of klebsiella oxytoca, species-specific 16s rrna gene and toxic gene cpa and cpe of clostridium perfringens, species-specific 16s rrna  gene with mapa and toxic gene hipo of campylobacter jejuni. clinical features of  the patients with positive results were summarized. results: among 102 patients with non-c. difficile associated nosocomial diarrhea, 4 patients (3.9%) were detected with toxic klebsiella oxytoca while 4 patients (3.9%) were detected with toxic clostridium perfringens. no toxic campylobacter jejuni was detected. most of the patients had severe underlying diseases and poor final outcome, accepted potent antibiotics which disturbed intestinal flora obviously.. conclusion: non-c. difficile associated nosocomial diarrhea in icu caused by klebsiella oxytoca is and clostridium perfringens is associated with severe diseases and poor outcome, but the incidence in our hospital is relatively low in our hospital.

TI  == [the hot point and controversy of clinical measures in critical are medicine].
AB  == with its powerful ability to monitoring and support of organs, the survival rate  of critically ill patients has been improved significantly by critical care medicine. critical ill patients centralized in icu accepted the treatments given  by multidisciplinary team as a mode have played a very important role, especially during the rescue of victims in public health emergencies and natural disasters.  changings of the measures of monitoring and support are always along with the development of the critical care medicine. fluid therapy is the most core measures in icu, but there is a significant contradiction between positive fluid  therapy and patient's impaired organ compensatory ability. the premise of appropriate fluid therapy is continuous and accurate evaluation of the hemodynamic status of critical ill patients. the variation of peak velocity of common carotid artery measured by bedside ultrasound can estimate the volume status of the sicu patients accurately. this method has high feasibility and accuracy and easy to be handled by the residents of icu. the non-c. difficile associated nosocomial diarrhea even fatal enteritis in icu can be caused by klebsiella oxytoca and clostridium perfringens. although this kind of incidence occurs in a relatively low rate, it always associates with severe diseases and poor outcome. analgesia and sedation had become routine measures in icu. there is still great controversy in some of the sedation protocol, such as sedation level  and wake up daily. more and more evidence-based data suggested taking appropriate sedation targeting to individuals, and the protocol should be integrated with the dealing of pain, anxiety and delirium.

TI  == postprocessing microflora of commercial attieke (a fermented cassava product) produced in the south of cote d'ivoire.
AB  == the distribution and presence of hygiene indicator and pathogenic micro-organisms in 375 samples of attieke marketed in cote d'ivoire, and their roles in the food  poisoning were evaluated. microbiological analyses were carried out, which included the total viable bacteria, coliforms, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella, bacillus spores, fungi and clostridium perfringens. the results revealed that the viable bacteria counts ranged from 2.2 +/- 1.2 x 10(5)  to 3.4 +/- 1.4 x 10(6) cfu g(-1), while the yeasts and the moulds counts ranged,  respectively, from 2.4 +/- 0.12 x 10(4) to 9.8 +/- 0.4 x 10(5) cfu g(-1) and 1.3  +/- 0.7 x 10(1) to 1.7 +/- 0.7 x 10(2) cfu g(-1). bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter freundi, enterobacter amnigenus, citrobacter youngae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter agglomerans and klebsiella oxytoca were the bacteria isolated, and rhizopus spp., mucor spp., thamnidium spp., fusarium spp., moniliella spp. the fungi. escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens and salmonella spp. were not found. the occurrence of some bacteria and fungi illustrate that attieke collected in cote d'ivoire markets may act as a reservoir of pathogenic micro-organisms for human. significance and impact of study: this study demonstrates the great need to carry out microbiological tests frequently on attieke and even more the need to apply correct haccp system during the production. attieke is especially a well-known product in west africa; hence, it  is extremely important to ensure an adequate microbiological quality to guarantee consumers health. overall, the study highlighted the need for effective communication on microbiological food risks, proper instruction and supervision in food-handling procedures, greater education on food safety risks.

TI  == nosocomial diarrhea: evaluation and treatment of causes other than clostridium difficile.
AB  == diarrhea is common among hospitalized patients but the causes are distinct from those of diarrhea in the community. we review existing data about the epidemiology of nosocomial diarrhea and summarize recent progress in understanding the mechanisms of diarrhea. clinicians should recognize that most cases of nosocomial diarrhea have a noninfectious etiology, including medications, underlying illness, and enteral feeding. apart from clostridium difficile, the frequency of infectious causes such as norovirus and toxigenic strains of clostridium perfringens, klebsiella oxytoca, staphylococcus aureus, and bacteroides fragilis remains largely undefined and test availability is limited. here we provide a practical approach to the evaluation and management of nosocomial diarrhea when tests for c. difficile are negative.

TI  == expression of a clostridium perfringens type iv pilin by neisseria gonorrhoeae mediates adherence to muscle cells.
AB  == clostridium perfringens is an anaerobic, gram-positive bacterium that causes a range of diseases in humans, including lethal gas gangrene. we have recently shown that strains of c. perfringens move across the surface of agar plates by a  unique type iv pilus (tfp)-mediated social motility that had not been previously  described. based on sequence homology to pilins in gram-negative bacteria, c. perfringens appears to have two pilin subunits, pila1 and pila2. structural prediction analysis indicated pila1 is similar to the pseudopilin found in klebsiella oxytoca, while pila2 is more similar to true pilins found in the gram-negative pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa and neisseria gonorrhoeae. strains of n. gonorrhoeae that were genetically deficient in the native pilin, pile, but  supplemented with inducible expression of pila1 and pila2 of c. perfringens were  constructed. genetic competence, wild-type twitching motility, and attachment to  human urogenital epithelial cells were not restored by expression of either pilin. however, attachment to mouse and rat myoblast (muscle) cell lines was observed with the n. gonorrhoeae strain expressing pila2. significantly, wild-type c. perfringens cells adhered to mouse myoblasts under anaerobic conditions, and adherence was 10-fold lower in a pilt mutant that lacked functional tfp. these findings implicate c. perfringens tfp in the ability of c.  perfringens to adhere to and move along muscle fibers in vivo, which may provide  a therapeutic approach to limiting this rapidly spreading and highly lethal infection.

TI  == nosocomial and antibiotic-associated diarrhoea caused by organisms other than clostridium difficile.
AB  == most cases of nosocomial and antibiotic-associated diarrhoea are caused by alteration of the physiological gut microflora. this alteration leads to reduced  microbial metabolism of carbohydrates and primary bile acids, resulting in osmotic or secretory forms of diarrhoea. moreover, facultative enteropathogens may experience a growth advantage due to the antibiotic-induced microflora alteration that, in turn, can harm the gut mucosa by the toxins they produce. clostridium difficile is the major infectious agent leading to pseudomembranous colitis. however, there is increasing evidence that certain other pathogens such  as enterotoxin-producing clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella oxytoca can induce mucosal deterioration and diarrhoea after antibiotic use. but, as with c. difficile, these facultative enteropathogens can  also be found in the healthy population. their contribution to disease is, therefore, controversial and their presence in the stools of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea patients is often claimed to be mere colonisation. in this respect, the causal relationship of each suspected pathogen with the development of intestinal disease has to be proved clinically and experimentally.

TI  == antibiotic-associated diarrhea: candidate organisms other than clostridium difficile.
AB  == background/aims: the direct toxic effects of antibiotics on the intestine can alter digestive functions and cause pathogenic bacterial overgrowth leading to antibiotic-associated diarrhea (aad). clostridium difficile (c. difficile) is widely known to be responsible for 10 approximately 20% of aad cases. however, klebsiella oxytoca, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, and candida species might also contribute to aad. methods: we prospectively analyzed the organisms in stool and colon tissue cultures with a c. difficile toxin a assay in patients with aad between may and december 2005. in addition, we performed the c. difficile toxin a assays using an enzyme-linked fluorescent assay technique. patients were enrolled who had diarrhea with more than three stools per day for at least 2 days after the initiation of antibiotic treatment for up to 6 approximately 8 weeks after antibiotic discontinuation. results: among 38 patients (mean age 59 +/- 18 years, m:f =18:20), the organism isolation rates were 28.9% (11/38) for stool culture, 18.4% (7/38) for colon tissue cultures and  13.2% (5/38) for the c. difficile toxin a assay. the overall rate of identification of organisms was 50.0% (19/38). of the five patients that had a positive result by the c. difficile toxin a assay, two had no organism isolated by the stool or colon tissue culture. the organisms isolated from the stool cultures were c difficile (4), klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae) (3), candida species (3), and staphylococcus aureus (1). c. difficile (4) and k. pneumoniae (3) were isolated from the colon tissue culture. conclusions: for c. difficile negative aad patients, k. pneumoniae, candida species and staphylococcus aureus were found to be potential causative organisms.

TI  == antibiotic associated diarrhoea: infectious causes.
AB  == nearly 25% of antibiotic associated diarrhoeas (aad) is caused by clostridium difficile, making it the commonest identified and treatable pathogen. other pathogens implicated infrequently include clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella oxytoca, candida spp. and salmonella spp. most mild cases of aad are due to non-infectious causes which include reduced break down of primary  bile acids and decrease metabolism of carbohydrates, allergic or toxic effects of antibiotic on intestinal mucosa and pharmacological effect on gut motility. the antibiotics most frequently associated with c. difficile associated diarrhoea are clindamycin, cephalosporin, ampicillin and amoxicillin. clinical presentation may vary from mild diarrhoea to severe colitis and pseudomembranous colitis associated with high morbidity and mortality. the most sensitive and specific diagnostic test for c. difficile infection is tissue culture assay for cytotoxicity of toxin b. commercial elisa kits are available. though less sensitive, they are easy to perform and are rapid. withdrawal of precipitating antibiotic is all that is needed for control of mild to moderate cases. for severe cases of aad, oral metronidazole is the first line of treatment, and oral  vancomycin is the second choice. probiotics have been used for recurrent cases.

TI  == microbial-gut interactions in health and disease. antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
AB  == most cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (aad) are directly or indirectly due to the alteration of gut microflora by antibiotics. 'functional' diarrhoea, usually limited to a mild and brief change in stool frequency, is considered as the most frequent pattern of aad. reduced carbohydrate fermentation and impaired  metabolism of bile acids have been claimed as the potential causes of this transient digestive discomfort but a critical analysis of the data supporting these theories is necessary. alternatively, changes in the gut flora ecosystem allow pathogens to proliferate. clostridium difficile is responsible for approximately 10% of cases of aad and almost all cases of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis. the level of evidence which supports the potential responsibility of other candidate pathogens (klebsiella oxytoca, enterotoxin-producing clostridium perfringens and staphylococcus aureus, candida) needs to be appreciated according to the updated postulates of causality relationships between a bacterium and a disease.

TI  == evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  == background: approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. the time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. study design and methods: isolates  of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus viridans were inoculated into day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 cfu per ml (2 units/organism). each bag was sampled 10 times (20 ml/sample). four ml of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 ml was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 ml into thioglycollate broth. results: with the exception of p. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. a range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. a mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 cfu/ml inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of p. acnes in anaerobic bottles. conclusion: bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 cfu per ml. p. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). however, p. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination.  such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet  storage.

TI  == mechanisms and management of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
AB  == only 10%-20% of all cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (aad) are caused by infection with clostridium difficile. other infectious organisms causing aad include clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella oxytoca, candida species, and salmonella species. most of the clinically mild aad cases are due to functional disturbances of intestinal carbohydrate or bile acid metabolism, to allergic and toxic effects of antibiotics on intestinal mucosa, or to pharmacological effects on motility. saccharomyces boulardii and enterococcus  sf68 can reduce the risk of developing aad. patients receiving antibiotic treatment should avoid food containing high amounts of poorly absorbable carbohydrates. mild cases of aad that may or may not be caused by c. difficile can be resolved by discontinuation of antibiotic therapy and by dietary carbohydrate reduction. only severe aad caused by c. difficile requires specific  antibiotic treatment.

TI  == opportunistic infections in hysterectomy-derived, barrier-maintained guinea pigs.
AB  == guineapigs were rederived by hysterectomy and associated with a colonization-resistant enteric microflora (crf) of mouse origin to establish a strict barrier-maintained breeding colony. infections were suspected in 55 of 209 animals autopsied. from 65 of 67 tissue samples selected for bacteriological examination 167 isolates, belonging to 16 usually non-pathogenic bacterial species or groups, were isolated mostly from cases of mastitis, typhlitis, enteritis, otitis media and pneumonia. faecal streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium perfringens, citrobacter spp., c. freundii, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca and enterobacter cloacae accounted for 86.8% of all isolates. variations in the recovery rate of these 8 species during the study and a gradual decline in the incidence of infections were observed. elimination by rederivation of the autochthonous bacterial flora seemed to have predisposed to opportunistic infections by aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria. enteric colonization resistance to the growth of these bacteria was presumably insufficiently provided by the crf of mouse origin and might be remedied by using a flora of guineapig origin.

TI  == assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  == blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (cfu) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. at intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (hs-glc). forty-six isolates including all those examined of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, s. faecalis, s. milleri, s. mitior, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia sp., enterobacter cloacae, bacterioides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, candida albicans, c. krusei and torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by hs-glc. hs-glc failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus. haemophilus influenzae, corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of s. epidermidis. the growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. no significant difference was found between hs-glc analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. all the yeast isolates were detected by hs-glc after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by hs-glc analysis than by other methods.
