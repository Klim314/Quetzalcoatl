TI  - An investigation of the presence of specific anaerobic species in necrotic primary teeth.
AB  - Different microbial identification methods have shown that the microbial community profiles in endodontic infections are diverse and assorted. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of selected endodontic pathogens in the pulp chambers (PCs) and root canals (RCs) of infected primary teeth using PCR methods. Paired PC and RC samples were collected from 15 subjects and analyzed by PCR for the presence of Filifactor alocis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella tannerae, Tanerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, and Treponema socranskii. The frequency of each species was determined in the PC and RC of each case. The species most frequently detected in PCs were P. nigrescens (86.7%), P. gingivalis (73.3%), and F. alocis (73.3%). Of the PC samples, 13.3% contained P. micra and T. denticola, and 6.7% contained T. forsythia. The species most frequently detected in RCs were P. gingivalis (100%) and P. nigrescens (93.3%). P. tannerae, P. micra, and T. denticola were found in 40% of the RC samples; T. forsythia was found in 26.7% of the RC samples. The "red complex", which comprises P. gingivalis, T. denticola, and T. forsythia, was not found in the PC of any tooth but was found in 30% of the RC samples. The detection of P. nigrescens in the PC was statistically associated with the presence of P. nigrescens in the RC (p = 0.04). The results suggest high heterogeneity among the samples, even among those from the same subject.
TI  - Molecular analysis of 16S rRNA genes identifies potentially periodontal pathogenic bacteria and archaea in the plaque of partially erupted third molars.
AB  - PURPOSE: Small subunit rRNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were used to identify cultivable and uncultivable microorganisms present in the dental plaque of symptomatic and asymptomatic partially erupted third molars to determine the prevalence of putative periodontal pathogens in pericoronal sites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Template DNA prepared from subgingival plaque collected from partially erupted symptomatic and asymptomatic mandibular third molars and healthy incisors was used in polymerase chain reaction with broad-range oligonucleotide primers to amplify 16S rRNA bacterial and archaeal genes. Amplicons were cloned, sequenced, and compared with known nucleotide sequences in online databases to identify the microorganisms present. RESULTS: Two thousand three hundred two clones from the plaque of 12 patients carried bacterial sequences from 63 genera belonging to 11 phyla, including members of the uncultivable TM7, SR1, and Chloroflexi, and difficult-to-cultivate Synergistetes and Spirochaetes. Dialister invisus, Filifactor alocis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella denticola, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola, which have been associated with periodontal disease, were found in significantly greater abundance in pericoronal compared with incisor sites. Dialister invisus and F nucleatum were found in greater abundance in sites exhibiting clinical symptoms. The archaeal species, Methanobrevibacter oralis, which has been associated with severe periodontitis, was found in 3 symptomatic patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings have provided new insights into the complex microbiota of pericoronitis. Several bacterial and archaeal species implicated in periodontal disease were recovered in greater incidence and abundance from the plaque of partially erupted third molars compared with incisors, supporting the hypothesis that the pericoronal region may provide a favored niche for periodontal pathogens in otherwise healthy mouths.
TI  - Antigenic activity of bacterial endodontic contents from primary root canal infection with periapical lesions against macrophage in the release of interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Periradicular tissue chronic stimulation by endotoxin may cause apical periodontitis. This study investigated the microbial profile and the levels of endotoxin found in primary root canal infection with apical periodontitis, determined their antigenicity against macrophages through the levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and evaluated their relationship with clinical and radiographic findings. METHODS: Samples were taken from 21 root canals with primary endodontic infection and apical periodontitis with paper points. PCR technique (16S rDNA) was used for the detection of the target bacteria. Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) was used to measure endotoxin. The amounts of IL-1ss/ TNF-alpha in macrophages supernatants were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay--Duoset-kit (ELISA). RESULTS: Prevotella nigrescens (13/21), Porphyromonas endodontalis (6/21), and Treponema socranskii (6/21) were the most frequently detected gram-negative bacterial species. The presence of the sinus tract (2/21) was related to the detection of Filifactor alocis (p < 0.05), whereas a tooth with a radiolucent area > or = 2 mm was related to the detection of Treponema denticola. A correlation was found between the number of gram-negative bacteria and the levels of IL-1beta/TNF-alpha (p < 0.05). Increased levels of endotoxin were followed by TNF-alpha release (p < 0.05). Higher levels of IL-1beta (p < 0.05) and endotoxin contents were related to the larger size of the radiolucent area. CONCLUSION: The antigenicity of the endodontic contents is not only related to the amount of endotoxin found in the root canal but also to the number of different species of gram-negative bacteria involved in the infection. Moreover, a larger size (> or = 2 mm) of the radiolucent area was related to IL-1beta and endotoxin.
TI  - Microbial analysis of canals of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - The objective of the present study was to investigate the presence of nine bacterial species in root-filled teeth associated with periapical lesions using a polymerase chain reaction analysis and to correlate these species with clinical features of the cases. DNA was extracted from 45 canal samples of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions. A PCR assay using species-specific primers of 16S rDNA and the downstream intergenic spacer region was used for microbial detection. Enterococcus faecalis was the most prevalent species, detected in 77.8% of the study teeth, followed by Peptostreptococcus micros, detected in 51.1%. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Prevotella nigrescens were detected in 35.6%, 22.2%, 11.1%, and 11.1% of the sampled teeth, respectively. Moreover, PCR detected Filifactor alocis in 26.7%, Treponema denticola in 24.4%, and Tannerella forsythia in 4.4% of the samples. T. denticola and P. micros were statistically associated with tenderness to percussion (p < 0.05). P. nigrescens was associated with the presence of spontaneous pain and abscess (p < 0.05). P. endodontalis and P. nigrescens were associated with purulent exudates (p < 0.05). Synergistic relationship was also observed between some species. The results of this study indicated that E. faecalis was the most frequently identified test species by PCR in teeth with failing endodontic treatment.
TI  - Selected endodontic pathogens in the apical third of infected root canals: a molecular investigation.
AB  - Bacteria located at the apical portion of the root canals are conceivably in a strategic position to induce damage to the periradicular tissues and resulting inflammatory diseases. This study sought to investigate the prevalence of 11 selected putative endodontic pathogens in the apical third of infected root canals associated with periradicular lesions. The apical root portion of 23 extracted teeth with carious pulpal exposures and attached periradicular lesions was sectioned, and the root canals were sampled for microbiological investigation. DNA was extracted from the samples and analyzed for the presence of 11 bacterial species using a nested polymerase chain reaction assay. The results showed that Pseuramibacter alactolyticus occurred in 10 cases (44%), Treponema denticola in 6 (26%), Fusobacterium nucleatum in 6 (26%), Porphyromonas endodontalis in 4 (17%), Filifactor alocis in 2 (9%), Dialister pneumosintes in 1 (4%), Porphyromonas gingivalis in 1 (4%), and Tannerella forsythensis in 1 (4%). No sample yielded Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, or Campylobacter rectus. Of the samples examined, 17 were positive for at least 1 of the target species. Occurrence of these bacterial species in the apical third of infected root canals suggests that they can be involved in causation of periradicular lesions.
