TI  == analysis of bacterial flora associated with peri-implantitis using obligate anaerobic culture technique and 16s rdna gene sequence.
AB  == purpose: to analyze and characterize the predominant bacterial flora associated with peri-implantitis by using culture techniques under obligate anaerobic conditions and 16s rdna gene sequences. materials and methods: subgingival bacterial specimens were taken from 30 patients: control (n = 15), consisting of  patients with only healthy implants; and test (n = 15), consisting of patients with peri-implantitis. in both groups, subgingival bacterial specimens were taken from the deepest sites. an anaerobic glove box system was used to cultivate bacterial strains. the bacterial strains were identified by 16s rdna genebased polymerase chain reaction and comparison of the gene sequences. results: peri-implantitis sites had approximately 10-fold higher mean colony forming units (per milliliter) than healthy implant sites. a total of 69 different bacterial species were identified in the peri-implantitis sites and 53 in the healthy implant sites. the predominant bacterial species in the peri-implantitis sites were eubacterium nodatum, e. brachy, e. saphenum, filifactor alocis, slackia exigua, parascardovia denticolens, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, centipeda periodontii, and parvimonas micra. the predominant bacteria in healthy implant sites apart from streptococcus were pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, veillonella species, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces species, propionibacterium acnes, and parvimonas micra. conclusion: these results suggest that the environment in the depths of the sulcus showing peri-implantitis is well suited for growth of obligate anaerobic bacteria. the present study demonstrated that the sulcus around oral implants with peri-implantitis harbors high levels of asaccharolytic anaerobic gram-positive rods (aagprs) such as e. nodatum, e. brachy, e. saphenum, filifactor alocis, slackia exigua, and gram-negative anaerobic rods, suggesting that conventional periodontopathic bacteria are not the only periodontal pathogens active in peri-implantitis, and that aagprs may also play an important role.

TI  == taxonomic characterization of mogibacterium diversum sp. nov. and mogibacterium neglectum sp. nov., isolated from human oral cavities.
AB  == novel isolates, strains hm-7, hm-6, hh-31, p9a-ht and ujb13-d, which were isolated from tongue plaque and necrotic dental pulp, were studied taxonomically  and phylogenetically. these organisms were anaerobic, non-spore-forming, gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria that were inert in most of the conventional biochemical tests and phenotypically resemble mogibacterium species or asaccharolytic eubacterium species. the g+c contents of the dnas from the novel isolates ranged from 41 to 42 mol %. dna-dna hybridization studies demonstrated that these strains might be assigned to the genus mogibacterium but not to the previously described species. it was also apparent that strain hm-7 belonged to the same species as strains hm-6 and hh-31, and that strains p9a-ht and ujb13-d belonged to a second species. the levels of dna-dna relatedness to asaccharolytic eubacterium species, including eubacterium brachy, eubacterium nodatum, eubacterium saphenum and the more recently proposed eubacterium minutum and eubacterium exiguum (reclassified as slackia exigua), are less than 2%. the results of 16s rdna sequence comparisons revealed that these organisms represent  novel lineages distinct from all previously described species of gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria. on the basis of phenotypic characteristics, dna-dna hybridization data and phylogenetic analysis with 16s rrna gene sequence data, new species are proposed, namely mogibacterium diversum (for strains hm-7, hm-6 and hh-31) and mogibacterium neglectum (for strains p9a-ht and ujb13-d). hm-7t (= atcc 700923t = jcm 11205t) is the type strain of the former and p9a-ht (= atcc 700924t = jcm 11204t) is the type strain for the latter.

TI  == detection of slackia exigua, mogibacterium timidum and eubacterium saphenum from  pulpal and periradicular samples using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method.
AB  == aim: the purpose of this study was to detect slackia exigua from root canal samples using a sensitive pcr amplification method. mogibacterium timidum and eubacterium saphenum were also included because of their culture-difficult properties. methodology: the species-specific pcr primers were prepared according to 16s rdna sequence analysis data, and confirmed to be effective for pcr amplification as species-specific, respectively. a total of 36 clinical samples were obtained during the first visit of root canal treatment. results: the sensitivity of detection was a minimum of 10 organisms for s. exigua and five organisms for m. timidum and e. saphenum, respectively. in seven cases of pulpitis, sexigua was detected in two cases (29%), and m. timidum in two cases (29%), but e. saphenum was not detected. in 17 cases of root canal treatment, s.  exigua was detected in seven cases (41%), m. timidum in 12 cases (71%) and e. saphenum in four cases (24%). in 12 cases of root canal retreatment, s. exigua was detected in three cases (25%), m. timidum in three cases (25%) and e. saphenum in two cases (17%). conclusions: s. exigua, m. timidum and e. saphenum were present in root canal systems, and may be associated with pulpal and periradicular pathosis.

TI  == description of mogibacterium pumilum gen. nov., sp. nov. and mogibacterium vescum gen. nov., sp. nov., and reclassification of eubacterium timidum (holdeman et al. 1980) as mogibacterium timidum gen. nov., comb. nov.
AB  == a new genus, mogibacterium, is proposed for anaerobic, non-spore-forming, gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria which have been isolated from the periodontal  pockets of adult human patients with periodontal disease and infected root canals. the novel isolates, strains d2-18t, ba11a-f and d5-2t, were inert in most of the conventional biochemical tests and phenotypically resemble asaccharolytic  eubacterium species. the protein profiles of whole cells on sds-page gels and western immunoblotting reaction analysis distinguished these organisms from type  strains belonging to the previously described eubacterium species. the g + c content of the dna is 45-46 mol% for mogibacterium pumilum and 46 mol% for mogibacterium vescum. the levels of dna-dna relatedness of these new species to other eubacterium species, including eubacterium limosum, eubacterium brachy, eubacterium lentum, eubacterium nodatum, eubacterium saphenum, and the more recently proposed eubacterium minutum and eubacterium exiguum (reclassified as slackia exigua), are less than 2%. the dna-dna hybridization value between m. pumilum and m. vescum was 30%. eubacterium timidum exhibited dna homologies with  mogibacterium species which were low (17 and 18%) but clearly higher than with all the other eubacterium species. phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequences revealed that the closest phylogenetic neighbour of mogibacterium species was e. timidum, and that these three species represent a novel lineage distinct from the previously described genera of gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria. on the basis of phenotypic characteristics and 16s rrna gene sequence comparisons, it is also proposed that e. timidum is transferred to the genus mogibacterium gen. nov. as mogibacterium timidum gen. nov., comb. nov. (type strain atcc 33093t).
