TI  == maple sap predominant microbial contaminants are correlated with the physicochemical and sensorial properties of maple syrup.
AB  == maple sap processing and microbial contamination are significant aspects that affect maple syrup quality. in this study, two sample sets from 2005 and 2008 were used to assess the maple syrup quality variation and its relationship to microbial populations, with respect to processing, production site and harvesting period. the abundance of maple sap predominant bacteria (pseudomonas fluorescens  group and two subgroups, rahnella spp., janthinobacterium spp., leuconostoc mesenteroides) and yeast (mrakia spp., mrakiella spp.,guehomyces pullulans) was assessed by quantitative pcr. maple syrup properties were analyzed by physicochemical and sensorial methods. results indicate that p. fluorescens, mrakia spp., mrakiella spp. g. pullulans and rahnella spp. are stable contaminants of maple sap, as they were found for every production site throughout the flow period. multiple factor analysis reports a link between the relative abundance of p. fluorescens group and mrakia spp. in maple sap with maple and vanilla odor as well as flavor of maple syrup. this evidence supports the contribution of these microorganisms or a consortium of predominant microbial contaminants to the characteristic properties of maple syrup.

TI  == exopolysaccharide-producing bacteria from sugar beets.
AB  == six hundred microorganisms were isolated from sugar beets collected from different parts of finland to study their slime production. a total of 170 of them produced exopolysaccharides, of which 35% were heteropolysaccharides. the yield of heteropolysaccharides from sucrose was lower than that of dextrans. five isolates, which were chosen for closer study, were identified as leuconostoc mesenteroides (two species), rahnella aquatilis (two species), and enterobacter amnigenus.
