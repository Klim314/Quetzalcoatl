TI  == purification and characterization of a novel plantaricin, kl-1y, from lactobacillus plantarum kl-1.
AB  == three bacteriocins from lactobacillus plantarum kl-1 were successfully purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange chromatography and reverse-phase hplc. the bacteriocin peptides kl-1x, -1y and -1z had molecular masses of 3053.82, 3498.16 and 3533.16 da, respectively. all three peptides were  stable at ph 2-12 and 25 degrees c and at high temperatures of 80 and 100 degrees c for 30 min and 121 degrees c for 15 min. however, they differed in their susceptibility to proteolytic enzymes and their inhibition spectra. kl-1y showed  broad inhibitory activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis dmst 17368, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 15442, p. aeruginosa atcc 9027, escherichia coli o157:h7 and e. coli atcc 8739. kl-1x and -1z inhibited only gram-positive bacteria. kl-1x, kl-1y and kl-1z exhibited synergistic activity. the successful amino acid sequencing of kl-1y had a hydrophobicity of approximately 30 % and no cysteine residues suggested its novelty, and it was designated "plantaricin kl-1y". plantaricin kl-1y exhibited bactericidal activity against bacillus cereus jcm 2152(t). compared to nisin, kl-1y displayed broad inhibitory activities of 200, 800, 1600, 800, 400 and 400 au/ml against the growth of bacillus coagulans jcm 2257(t), b. cereus jcm 2152(t), listeria innocua atcc 33090(t), staphylococcus aureus tistr 118, e. coli o157:h7 and e. coli atcc 8739, respectively, whereas nisin had similar activities against only b. coagulans jcm 2257(t) and b. cereus jcm 2152(t). therefore, the novel plantaricin kl-1y is a promising antimicrobial substance for food safety uses in the future.

TI  == novel topical formulation for ischemic chronic wounds. technological design, quality control and safety evaluation.
AB  == abstract ulceration of the foot in diabetes is common and disabling, and frequently leads to amputation of the leg. the pathogenesis of foot ulceration is complex, clinical presentation variable and management requires early expert assessment. despite treatment, ulcers readily become chronic wounds. chronic wounds are those that remain in a chronic inflammatory state failing a normal healing process patterns. this is partially caused by inefficient eradication of  opportunistic pathogens like pseudomonas aeruginosa. we propose its control or eradication will promote wound healing. lactobacillus plantarum cultures supernatants (laps) shows antipathogenic and pro-healing properties. the main objective was to design two pharmaceutical dosage forms by using laps as active pharmaceutical ingredient and to perform its quality control, in vitro activity conservation tests and human trials (safety evaluation). both selected formulations reach the technological quality expected for 120 days, shows adequate occlusive characteristics and proper adhesion to human skin. from the in vitro release assays were found that laps shows adequate release from matrix and  maintain its antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activity. first human trials were developed and neither edema nor erythema on healthy skin voluntaries was found. we conclude that c80 and c100 are adequate for their use in future clinical trials to demonstrate a comprehensive therapeutic effectiveness in ischemic chronic wounds.

TI  == probiotic potential of lactobacillus strains isolated from sorghum-based traditional fermented food.
AB  == sorghum-based traditional fermented food was screened for potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria. the isolates were identified by biochemical, physiological  and genetic methods. species identification was done by 16s rrna sequence analysis. the functional probiotic potential of the two lactobacillus species viz., lactobacillus plantarum (lact. plantarum) and lactobacillus pentosus (lact. pentosus) was assessed by different standard parameters. the strains were tolerant to ph 2 for 1 h and resistant to methicillin, kanamycin, vancomycin and  norfloxacin. two (lact. plantarum coorg-3 and lact. pentosus coorg-8) out of eight isolates recorded the cell surface hydrophobicity to be 59.12 and 64.06 %,  respectively. all the strains showed tolerance to artificial duodenum juice (ph 2) for 3 h, positive for bile salt hydrolase test and negative for haemolytic test. the neutralized cell-free supernatant of the strains lact. pentosus coorg-4, lact. plantarum coorg-1, lact. plantarum coorg-7, lact. pentosus coorg-8 and lact. plantarum coorg-3 showed good antibiofilm activity. lact. pentosus coorg-8 exhibited 74 % activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa-mtcc 7903 and lact. plantarum coorg-7 showed 68 % inhibition of biofilm against klebsiella pneumonia mtcc 7407. three (lact. plantarum coorg-7, lact. pentosus coorg-5 and lact. pentosus coorg 8) out of eight isolates exhibited a good antimicrobial activity against listeria monocytogenes and five isolates (lact. pentosus coorg 2, lact. plantarum coorg 1, lact. plantarum coorg 4, lact. pentosus coorg 3 and lact. plantarum coorg 6) are active against escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumonia, enterococcus faecalis. the study also evaluated the cholesterol lowering property of the lactobacillus strains using hen egg yolk as the cholesterol source. the cholesterol in hen egg yolk was assimilated by 74.12 and 68.26 % by lact. plantarum coorg 4 and lact. pentosus coorg 7, respectively. the results of the present study suggest that the lactobacillus strains isolated and characterized from sorghum-based fermented product may be used as probiotic strains for therapeutic applications.

TI  == pre-treatment with probiotics prolongs survival after experimental infection by multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa in rodents: an effect on sepsis-induced immunosuppression.
AB  == based on several randomised clinical studies indicating benefit from oral probiotic intake for the prevention of hospital-acquired infections in critically ill patients, this study aimed to explain the mechanism of action of probiotics for the prevention of lethal experimental infection by multidrug-resistant (mdr)  pseudomonas aeruginosa. experiments using an escherichia coli strain susceptible  to all antimicrobials were also conducted. c57bl/6 mice were pre-treated intraperitoneally with sterile water for injection or lactobacillus plantarum. survival was recorded and mice were sacrificed for measurement of apoptosis and tissue bacterial overgrowth and for isolation and culture of splenocytes for cytokine production. experiments were repeated after pre-treatment with a commercial preparation of four probiotics (l. plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, saccharomyces boulardii and bifidobacterium lactis; lactolevure((r))). peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) of healthy volunteers were stimulated by heat-killed p. aeruginosa following pre-treatment with medium or probiotics. pre-treatment with l. plantarum significantly prolonged survival after challenge by either mdr p. aeruginosa (66.7% vs. 31.3%;  p=0.026) or e. coli (56.0% vs. 12.0%, p=0.003). survival benefit was even more pronounced when mice were pre-treated with lactolevure((r)). tissue bacterial outgrowth and apoptosis of white blood cells and splenocytes were not altered. tnfalpha and il-10 production by splenocytes of mice pre-treated with probiotic was increased and ifngamma production was decreased. pre-treatment with lactolevure((r)) restored production of il-17. stimulation of human pbmcs after probiotic pre-treatment was accompanied by reduced gene expression of socs3. the  results suggest that the protective effect of probiotics is mediated through prevention of sepsis-induced immunosuppression.

TI  == compounds from lactobacillus plantarum culture supernatants with potential pro-healing and anti-pathogenic properties in skin chronic wounds.
AB  == context: it is necessary to advance the field of alternative treatments for chronic wounds that are financially accessible to the least economically developed countries. previously we demonstrated that topical applications of lactobacillus plantarum culture supernatants (laps) on human-infected chronic wounds reduce the pathogenic bioburden, the amount of necrotic tissue, and the wound area, as well as promote debridement, granulation tissue, and wound healing. objective: to study laps chemically and biologically and to find potential molecules responsible for its pro-healing and anti-pathogenic properties in chronic wounds. materials and methods: (1) chemical analysis: extracts were subjected to a column chromatography and the fractions obtained were studied by gcms. (2) quantification: dl-lactic acid (commercial kit), phenolic compounds (folin-ciocalteu), h2o2 (micro-titration), and cations (flame  photometry). (3) biological analysis: autoinducers type 2 (ai-2) (vibrio harveyi  bb170 bioassay), dnaase activity (agar dnaase), and pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm inhibition (crystal violet technique). results: according to its biological activity, the most significant molecules found by gcms were the following: antimicrobials (mevalonolactone, 5-methyl-hydantoine, benzoic acid, etc.); surfactants (di-palmitin, distearin, and 1,5-monolinolein); anesthetics (barbituric acid derivatives), and ai-2 precursors (4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione and 2-methyl-2,3,3,4-tetrahydroxytetrahydrofurane). concentrations measured (microg/ml): dl-lactic acid (11.71 +/- 1.53) and h2o2 (36 +/- 2.0); phenolic compounds (485.2 +/- 15.20); sodium (370 +/- 17); potassium 920 +/- 24); calcium  (20 +/- 4); and magnesium (15 +/- 3). dnaase from laps had activity on genomic dna from pmns and p. aeruginosa. discussion and conclusion: the molecules and biological activities found in laps could explain the observed effects in human chronic wounds.

TI  == formulation and quality control of semi-solid containing harmless bacteria by-products: chronic wounds pro-healing activity.
AB  == abstract chronic wounds are those that remain in a chronic inflammatory state and fail to follow normal healing process. infection is one of the most important causes of chronicity. a frequent pathogen isolated from chronic infections is pseudomonas aeruginosa; refractory to therapy and host immune attack in its biofilm phenotype. lactobacillus plantarum cultures supernatants (laps) interfere with its pathogenic capacity. in addition, laps showed bacteriostatic and bactericide properties and is neither cytotoxic nor an inductor of necrosis-apoptosis. lapss chemical composition was determined; allowing us to propose a correlation between its constituents and their biological activity. this article shows a pharmaceutical dosage form designed by using laps as an api  with pro-healing activity and its quality control. pharmacotechnical and anti-microbial assays were adapted to demonstrate that the vehicle used does not  modify laps activities. selected formulation (f100) showed fair mechanical and technological properties. from the in vitro release assays was found an adequate  release from the carrier matrix and maintains its anti-pathogenic activity for 6  months. we propose f100 for chronic wounds treatment. the use of harmless bacteria by-products, such as laps, to antagonize infectious pathogens that have  ability to form biofilm is an efficient and economic approach to treat infected chronic wounds.

TI  == evaluation of indirect impedance for measuring microbial growth in complex food matrices.
AB  == the suitability of indirect impedance to accurately measure microbial growth in real food matrices was investigated. a variety of semi-solid and liquid food products were inoculated with bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus plantarum, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella enteriditis, candida tropicalis or zygosaccharomyces rouxii and co2 production was monitored using a conductimetric (don whitely r.a.b.i.t.) system. the majority (80%) of food and microbe combinations produced  a detectable growth signal. the linearity of conductance responses in selected food products was investigated and a good correlation (r(2) >/= 0.84) was observed between inoculum levels and times to detection. specific growth rate estimations from the data were sufficiently accurate for predictive modeling in some cases. this initial evaluation of the suitability of indirect impedance to generate microbial growth data in complex food matrices indicates significant potential for the technology as an alternative to plating methods.

TI  == interaction of antimicrobial peptide plantaricin149a and four analogs with lipid  bilayers and bacterial membranes.
AB  == the amidated analog of plantaricin149, an antimicrobial peptide from lactobacillus plantarum nric 149, directly interacts with negatively charged liposomes and bacterial membranes, leading to their lysis. in this study, four pln149-analogs were synthesized with different hydrophobic groups at their n-terminus with the goal of evaluating the effect of the modifications at this region in the peptide's antimicrobial properties. the interaction of these peptides with membrane models, surface activity, their hemolytic effect on red blood cells, and antibacterial activity against microorganisms were evaluated. the analogs presented similar action of plantaricin149a; three of them with no hemolytic effect (< 5%) until 0.5 mm, in addition to the induction of a helical element when binding to negative liposomes. the n-terminus difference between the analogs and plantaricin149a retained the antibacterial effect on s. aureus and p. aeruginosa for all peptides (mic50 of 19 mum and 155 mum to plantaricin149a, respectively) but resulted in a different mechanism of action against the microorganisms, that was bactericidal for plantaricin149a and bacteriostatic for  the analogs. this difference was confirmed by a reduction in leakage action for the analogs. the lytic activity of plantaricin149a is suggested to be a result of the peptide-lipid interactions from the amphipathic helix and the hydrophobic residues at the n-terminus of the antimicrobial peptide.

TI  == lactonase-expressing lactobacillus plantarum nc8 attenuates the virulence factors of multiple drug resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa in co-culturing environment.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa possesses an arcade of both cell-associated and extracellular cytotoxic virulence factors which are regulated by a multi-component quorum sensing system. many research studies report success of lactonase in combating the pathogenicity of p. aeruginosa but delivery of lactonase remains a challenge. the present study aims at developing a delivery vehicle for lactonase. lactobacillus plantarum nc8 was used as host for aiia (bacillus thuringiensis 4a3 lactonase gene) using psip409 expression vector. psip409: aiia construct was stably maintained in l. plantarum nc8. co-culturing of multi-drug resistant (mdr) clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa and pao1 with recombinant l. plantarum nc8 led to significant reduction (p < 0.001) in extracellular virulence factors like pyocyanin, protease, elastase and rhamnolipids in p. aeruginosa and also showed significant reduction in adhesion of p. aeruginosa strains to uroepithelial cells in vitro. this study shows the heterologous expression of aiia lactonase in l. plantarum nc8. co-culturing of lactonase expressing l. plantarum nc8 with mdr p. aeruginosa strains led to attenuation of their virulence significantly. these results underscore the potential application of recombinant l. plantarum nc8 with anti-quorum sensing properties to control infections caused by multidrug resistant p. aeruginosa.

TI  == plantaricin ld1: a bacteriocin produced by food isolate of lactobacillus plantarum ld1.
AB  == plantaricin ld1, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus plantarum ld1, was characterized for biochemical and antimicrobial properties. bacteriocin showed stability at high temperatures (100 degrees c for 20 min and 121 degrees c for 15 min under 15 psi pressure), in a ph range of 2.0-8.0 and also in the presence of  organic solvents, surfactants and detergents. the crude preparation was not affected by catalase, amylase and lipase but activity was reduced in the presence of pepsin, trypsin and proteinase k showing proteinaceous nature of the compound. the molecular weight of bacteriocin was found to be approximately 6.5 kda, and antimicrobial activity was confirmed by bioassay. it inhibited not only related strains but also other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria such as lactobacillus curvatus nrrl b-4562, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis nrrl b-1821, enterococcus faecium nrrl b-2354, enterobacter cloacae nrrl b-14298, micrococcus  luteus, staphylococcus aureus, urogenic escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri and vibrio sp. these properties of plantaricin ld1 suggest its applications not only in food safety but in therapeutics as well.

TI  == human pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and viruses in drosophila: disease modeling, lessons, and shortcomings.
AB  == drosophila has been the invertebrate model organism of choice for the study of innate immune responses during the past few decades. many drosophila-microbe interaction studies have helped to define innate immunity pathways, and significant effort has been made lately to decipher mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis. here we catalog 68 bacterial, fungal, and viral species studied in  flies, 43 of which are relevant to human health. we discuss studies of human pathogens in flies revealing not only the elicitation and avoidance of immune response but also mechanisms of tolerance, host tissue homeostasis, regeneration, and predisposition to cancer. prominent among those is the emerging pattern of intestinal regeneration as a defense response induced by pathogenic and innocuous bacteria. immunopathology mechanisms and many microbial virulence factors have been elucidated, but their relevance to human health conventionally necessitates  validation in mammalian models of infection.

TI  == frequent replenishment sustains the beneficial microbiome of drosophila melanogaster.
AB  == we report that establishment and maintenance of the drosophila melanogaster microbiome depend on ingestion of bacteria. frequent transfer of flies to sterile food prevented establishment of the microbiome in newly emerged flies and reduced the predominant members, acetobacter and lactobacillus spp., by 10- to 1,000-fold in older flies. flies with a normal microbiome were less susceptible than germfree flies to infection by serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. augmentation of the normal microbiome with higher populations of lactobacillus plantarum, a drosophila commensal and probiotic used in humans, further protected the fly from infection. replenishment represents an unexplored strategy by which  animals can sustain a gut microbial community. moreover, the population behavior  and health benefits of l. plantarum resemble features of certain probiotic bacteria administered to humans. as such, l. plantarum in the fly gut may serve as a simple model for dissecting the population dynamics and mode of action of probiotics in animal hosts. importance: previous studies have defined the composition of the drosophila melanogaster microbiome in laboratory and wild-caught flies. our study advances current knowledge in this field by demonstrating that drosophila must consume bacteria to establish and maintain its microbiome. this finding suggests that the dominant drosophila symbionts remain associated with their host because of repeated reintroduction rather than internal growth. furthermore, our study shows that one member of the microbiome,  lactobacillus plantarum, protects the fly from intestinal pathogens. these results suggest that, although not always present, the microbiota can promote salubrious effects for the host. in sum, our work provides a previously unexplored mechanism of microbiome maintenance and an in vivo model system for investigating the mechanisms of action of probiotic bacteria.

TI  == cell-free supernatants obtained from fermentation of cheese whey hydrolyzates and phenylpyruvic acid by lactobacillus plantarum as a source of antimicrobial compounds, bacteriocins, and natural aromas.
AB  == cheese whey hydrolyzates supplemented with phenylpyruvic acid (ppa) and commercial nutrients can be efficiently metabolized by lactobacillus plantarum cect-221 to biosynthesize some compounds with attractive applications in the food market. the main metabolites of cell-free extracts were antimicrobial compounds such as phenyllactic acid (pla) and lactic acid (la). the production of pla by l. plantarum cect-221 was evaluated in the man-rogosa-sharpe broth supplemented with two biosynthetic precursors: phenylalanine or ppa. using 30.5 mm ppa, the microorganism increased sevenfold the concentration of pla producing 16.4 mm pla  in 46 h. a concentration of 40 mm ppa was a threshold to avoid substrate inhibition. the biosynthesis of whey hydrolyzates as a carbon source was enhanced by fed-batch fermentation of ppa; the average productivity of pla increased up to 45.4 +/- 3.02 mm after 120 h with a product yield of 0.244 mm mm(-1); meanwhile,  la reached 26.1 +/- 1.3 g l(-1) with a product yield of 0.72 g g(-1). cell-free fed-batch extracts charged in wells showed bacteriocin activity with halos of 7.49 +/- 1.44 mm in plates inoculated with carnobacterium piscicola and antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus (11.54 +/- 1.14 mm), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.17 +/- 2.46 mm), listeria monocytogenes (7.75 +/- 1.31 mm), and salmonella enterica (3.60 +/- 1.52 mm). additionally, the analysis of the volatile composition of the headspace of this cell-free extract revealed that l. plantarum is a potential producer for natural aromas, such as acetophenone, with high price in the market. this is the first report of pla production from cheese whey and ppa. the extracts showed bacteriocin activity and potential to be applied as an antimicrobial in the elaboration of safer foods.

TI  == antipathogenic properties of lactobacillus plantarum on pseudomonas aeruginosa: the potential use of its supernatants in the treatment of infected chronic wounds.
AB  == pathogenic bacteria delay wound healing through several different mechanisms such as persistent production of inflammatory mediators or maintenance of necrotic neutrophils, which release cytolytic enzymes and free oxygen radicals. one of the most frequent pathogens isolated from infections in chronic wounds is pseudomonas aeruginosa. this bacterium is extremely refractory to therapy and to host immune  attack when it forms biofilms. therefore, antibiotics and antiseptics are becoming useless in the treatment of these infections. in previous works, we demonstrated that lactobacillus plantarum has an important antipathogenic capacity on p. aeruginosa. the aim of the present work was to elucidate the mechanism involved in the control of growth of p. aeruginosa on different surfaces by l. plantarum. for this purpose, we investigated the effects of l. plantarum supernatants on pathogenic properties of p. aeruginosa, such as adhesion, viability, virulence factors, biofilm formation, and quorum sensing signal expression. l. plantarum supernatants were able to inhibit pathogenic properties of p. aeruginosa by a quorum quenching mechanism. the antipathogenic properties mentioned above, together with the immunomodulatory, tissue repair, and angiogenesis properties in the supernatants of l. plantarum, make them an attractive option in infected chronic wound treatment.

TI  == antimicrobial and safety properties of lactobacilli isolated from two cameroonian traditional fermented foods.
AB  == twenty-one lactobacillus isolates from "sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. these isolates were preliminarily identified as lactobacillus plantarum (62%), lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-pcr genomic fingerprinting. twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, proteinase k) and inhibition of other lactobacillus spp. these  bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin g, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. the bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria,  several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the world health organization, as well as multidrug-resistant strains. these include staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare typhi, bacillus cereus, streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella pneumoniae and shigella flexneri. these lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.

TI  == alginate films containing viable lactobacillus plantarum: preparation and in vitro evaluation.
AB  == the objective of the study was to develop calcium alginate films, containing lactobacillus plantarum atcc 8040 with preserved and stable viability and antibacterial activity. l. plantarum-loaded films containing different calcium concentrations were physically characterized for mechanical and bioadhesive properties and lactobacilli release. the viability and antibacterial activity of  l. plantarum was studied before and after processing, and during 6 months of storage. a multiresistant clinical isolate, vim-2-metalo-beta-lactamase producing pseudomonas aeruginosa, was used as an indicator strain. interference between l.  plantarum and films enhanced films elasticity, water absorption ability, release  of lactobacilli, and decreased films adherence. a decrease of l. plantarum viability in alginate films (</=1 log unit) was observed after freeze drying. l.  plantarum, at cell concentrations of 108 cfu/ml, was inhibitory active. the viability and antibacterial activity of the immobilized lactobacilli remained stable during 6 months of storage. the study has proved the potential of alginate films to deliver l. plantarum in high numbers to individuals.

TI  == antibiosis of vineyard ecosystem fungi against food-borne microorganisms.

TI  == antagonistic intestinal microflora produces antimicrobial substance inhibitory to pseudomonas species and other spoilage organisms.
AB  == chicken intestine harbors a vast number of bacterial strains. in the present study, antimicrobial substance produced by lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of healthy chicken was detected, characterized, and purified. based on 16s rrna sequencing, the bacteria were identified as lactobacillus plantarum vn. the antimicrobial substance produced by this bacterium was designated vn-1 and exhibited a broad-spectrum of activity against  many important pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus, salmonella typhimurium, and erwinia amylovova. vn-1 was determined to be thermostable, insensitive to ph  values ranging from 2.0 to 8.0, resistant to various organic solvents and to enzymatic inactivation. the inhibition kinetics displayed a bactericidal mode of  action. this study revealed an antimicrobial substance with low molecular mass of less than 1 kda as determined by ultrafiltration and having features not previously reported for lab isolated from chicken intestines. the detection of this antimicrobial substance addresses an important aspect of biotechnological control agents of spoilage caused by pseudomonas spp. and promises the possibility for preservation of refrigerated poultry meat. practical application: the newly characterized antimicrobial substance and designated as vn-1 may have the potential to be used in food preservation.

TI  == preservation of viability and antibacterial activity of lactobacillus spp. in calcium alginate beads.
AB  == the objective of the study was to produce calcium alginate beads able to deliver  lactobacillus spp. (lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus bulgaricus and lactobacillus lactis) with preserved viability and antibacterial activity. four types of beads, containing entrapped (e), surface and entrapped (es), surface (s) and concentrated surface and entrapped lactobacilli (c(es)) were prepared and physically characterized. the antibacterial activity of lactobacilli cultures before and after immobilization,  freeze-drying and throughout storage was studied in relationship to the viable number of lactobacilli. multi-resistant clinical isolates (methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus, vancomycine-resistant enterococcus faecalis, vim-2-metalo-beta-lactamase producing pseudomonas aeruginosa and ctx-m-15-beta-lactamase producing strains: escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae) were used as indicator strains. alginate beads in which lactobacilli  proliferated to the beads surface (es and c(es)) differed significantly from the  other types of beads in their physicochemical properties, showing smoother surface morphology, more spherical shape, bigger weight, lower calcium content, density and crushing force. lactobacilli cultures, at high cell concentrations (10(8)cfu/ml) were active against both gram-positive and negative multi-resistant bacteria. beads containing both entrapped and surface lactobacilli (es) resulted  in viability and antibacterial activity most similar to non-processed lactobacilli cultures. the viability and antibacterial activity of the immobilized lactobacilli remained stable after 6 months storage.

TI  == probiotics versus antibiotic decontamination of the digestive tract: infection and mortality.
AB  == purpose: selective decontamination of the digestive tract (sdd) has been shown to decrease the infection rate and mortality in intensive care units (icus); lactobacillus plantarum 299/299v plus fibre (lab) has been used for infection prevention and does not harbour the potential disadvantages of antibiotics. the objective was to assess whether lab is not inferior to sdd in infection prevention. methods: two hundred fifty-four consecutive icu patients with expected mechanical ventilation >/= 48 h and/or expected icu stay >/= 72 h were assigned to receive sdd: four times daily an oral paste (polymyxin e, gentamicin, amphotericin b), enteral solution (same antibiotics), intravenous cefotaxime (first 4 days) or lab: two times daily l. plantarum 299/299v with rose-hip. results: the primary endpoint was infection rate. a difference <12% between both  groups indicated non-inferiority of lab. the trial was prematurely stopped after  a study reporting increased mortality in critically ill pancreatitis patients receiving probiotics. no significant difference in infection rate [31% in the lab group, 24% in the sdd group (or 1.68, 95% ci 0.91-3.08; p = 0.10)] was found. icu mortality was 26% and not significantly different between the lab and sdd groups. gram-positive cocci and pseudomonas aeruginosa were significantly more frequently isolated from surveillance cultures in the sdd group compared to the lab group (for sputum: 18 vs. 10% and 33 vs. 14%). significantly more enterobacteriaceae were found in the lab group (23 vs. 50%). no increase in antibiotic resistance was found during and after sdd or lab use. conclusions: the trial could not demonstrate the non-inferiority of lab compared with sdd in infection prevention. results suggest no increased icu mortality risk in the lab group.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of phenolic acids against commensal, probiotic and pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == phenolic acids (benzoic, phenylacetic and phenylpropionic acids) are the most abundant phenolic structures found in fecal water. as an approach towards the exploration of their action in the gut, this paper reports the antimicrobial activity of thirteen phenolic acids towards escherichia coli, lactobacillus spp., staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. the growth of e. coli atcc 25922 was inhibited by only four of the phenolic acids tested at a concentration of 1000 microg/ml, whereas pathogenic e. coli o157:h7 (cect 5947) was susceptible to ten of them. the genetically manipulated e. coli lpxc/tolc strain was highly susceptible to phenolic acids. the growth of lactobacilli (lactobacillus paraplantarum lch7, lactobacillus plantarum lch17, lactobacillus fermentum lph1, l. fermentum cect 5716, lactobacillus brevis lch23, and lactobacillus coryniformis cect 5711) and pathogens (s. aureus ep167 and c. albicans my1055) was also inhibited by phenolic acids, but to varying extents. only p. aeruginosa pao1 was not susceptible to any of the phenolic compounds tested. structure-activity relationships of phenolic acids and some of their diet precursors [(+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin] were established, based on multivariate analysis of microbial activities. the antimicrobial properties of phenolic acids reported in this paper might be relevant in vivo.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus plantarum and pseudomonas aeruginosa culture supernatants on polymorphonuclear damage and inflammatory response.
AB  == in a previous study we determined that by-products of lactobacillus plantarum inhibited pathogenicity of pseudomonas aeruginosa and is effective in the treatment of infected wounds. this study assesses the cytotoxic activity of acetic acid (aa), supernatants of l. plantarum and p. aeruginosa, with and without signal acyl-homoserine-lactones (ahl), and mixtures of both bacterial supernatants on human neutrophils. cytotoxicity was determined through viability  using trypan blue, apoptosis by annexin v, necrosis by propidium iodide and intracellular ph by snarf-1. we found that supernatants of l. plantarum caused less cytotoxicity than aa at the same extracellular ph (p<0.05). p. aeruginosa induced a remarkable drop in intracellular ph, which was independent of extracellular ph. this intracellular acidity was correlated with a significant decrease in viability and was higher than supernatants of ahl producing p. aeruginosa (p<0.05). when supernatants were mixed, the quantity of ahl diminished (p<0.001) and the cytotoxic effect induced by p.aeruginosa was ameliorated by l.  plantarum supernatant (p<0.001 vs p<0.01). these results are in agreement with the inflammatory in vivo assays determined by intradermal inoculations in balb/c  mice. our findings will be useful for the formulation of effective and inexpensive products to resolve infected chronic wounds in our hospitals.

TI  == inhibition of fungi and gram-negative bacteria by bacteriocin bactn635 produced by lactobacillus plantarum sp. tn635.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate 54 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains isolated from meat, fermented vegetables and dairy products for their capacity to produce antimicrobial activities against several bacteria and fungi. the strain designed tn635 has been selected for advanced studies. the supernatant culture of this strain inhibits the growth of all tested pathogenic including the four gram-negative bacteria (salmonella enterica atcc43972, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 49189, hafnia sp. and serratia sp.) and the pathogenic fungus candida tropicalis r2 cip203. based on the nucleotide sequence of the 16s rrna gene of the strain tn635 (1,540 pb accession no fn252881) and the phylogenetic analysis,  we propose the assignment of our new isolate bacterium as lactobacillus plantarum sp. tn635 strain. its antimicrobial compound was determined as a proteinaceous substance, stable to heat and to treatment with surfactants and organic solvents. highest antimicrobial activity was found between ph 3 and 11 with an optimum at ph = 7. the bactn635 was purified to homogeneity by a four-step protocol involving ammonium sulfate precipitation, centrifugal microconcentrators with a 10-kda membrane cutoff, gel filtration sephadex g-25, and c18 reverse-phase hplc. sds-page analysis of the purified bactn635, revealed a single band with an estimated molecular mass of approximately 4 kda. the maximum bacteriocin production (5,000 au/ml) was recorded after a 16-h incubation in man, rogosa, and sharpe (mrs) medium at 30 degrees c. the mode of action of the partial purified bactn635 was identified as bactericidal against listeria ivanovii bug 496 and as  fungistatic against c. tropicalis r2 cip203.

TI  == interleukin-8 production by polymorphonuclear leukocytes from patients with chronic infected leg ulcers treated with lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == bacterial infection impairs the healing process, promoting the chronicity of inflammation and wounds. because antibiotics fail to eradicate bacteria, especially in biofilm form, new therapeutic modalities may be required. in the present study, the effectiveness of bacteriotherapy with lactobacillus plantarum  on infected chronic venous ulcers was investigated and its effects on interleukin (il)-8 production by cells from the ulcer bed and neutrophils isolated from peripheral blood that were previously challenged in vitro with pseudomonas aeruginosa and l. plantarum were studied. topical application of l. plantarum culture to lesions (25-60 cm(2)) of 14 diabetic and 20 non-diabetic patients induced debridement, granulation tissue formation and total healing after 30 days in 43% diabetics and in 50% non-diabetics. no significant differences between the groups were observed. the cells from ulcer beds collected after treatment with l. plantarum for 10 days showed a decrease in the percentage of polymorphonuclear, apoptotic and necrotic cells and an enhancement of il-8 production. il-8 production by isolated neutrophils from these patients was compared with that in  diabetics without ulcers, as well as normal subjects under basal conditions, and  after infection of polymorphonuclear cells with p. aeruginosa preincubated either with or without l. plantarum. the basal values in diabetic and ulcer patients were higher than normal (p <0.001) and were increased by p. aeruginosa infection  in normal, diabetics (p <0.001) and non-diabetics with ulcers (p <0.01). preincubation with l. plantarum decreased il-8 production in patients with ulcers non-diabetic and diabetic (p <0.001). lactobacillus plantarum treatment reduced wound bacterial load, neutrophils, apoptotic and necrotic cells, modified il-8 production and induced wound healing.

TI  == characterization of the beneficial properties of lactobacilli isolated from bullfrog (rana catesbeiana) hatchery.
AB  == the present work addresses the isolation and partial identification of the microbial population of a r. catesbeiana hatchery in spring and summer as well as some beneficial properties of lactobacillus strains isolated in different seasons and hatchery areas. the bacterial population was grouped into the following taxa: lactobacillus spp., pediococcus spp., enterococcus faecalis and ent. faecium, and enterobacteriaceae (enterobacter spp., escherichia coli) while pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis were isolated from frogs displaying red-leg syndrome. the lactobacillus plantarum and l. curvatus strains isolated showed to inhibit the growth of red-leg syndrome associated pathogens and food-borne bacteria by organic acids. while l. plantarum crl 1606 also inhibited  red-leg syndrome related pathogens by hydrogen peroxide, meat spoilage bacteria were only inhibited by acidity. however, by using a mrs medium added with tetramethyl-benzidine and peroxidase, a high percentage of h(2)o(2)-producing lactobacilli were detected. the surface properties of lactobacillus strains showed that a few strains were able to agglutinate abo human erythrocytes, while  the highest number of strains had a low to medium degree of hydrophobicity. this  paper constitute the first study related to the beneficial properties of lactobacillus isolated from a bullfrog hatchery, as well as the selection criteria applied to a group of strains, which could help to control or prevent bacterial infectious diseases in raniculture.

TI  == differences between pseudomonas aeruginosa in a clinical sample and in a colony isolated from it: comparison of virulence capacity and susceptibility of biofilm  to inhibitors.
AB  == we study the differences between pseudomonas aeruginosa from an infected wound (clinical strain) and a colony isolated from it. we assessed the in vitro inhibition of these p. aeruginosa biofilms by dnase and filtrate of lactobacillus plantarum cultures (acid=af and neutralize=nf) with crystal violet technique. inhibition by af was greatest than dnase for clinical and isolated strain (p<0.001) and greatest than nf for clinical (p<0.05) and isolated strain (p<0.001). using a burn model in mice, we compared the infection producing by clinical and isolated strains in planktonic and biofilm form. deaths were quantified and the infection was assessed by determining cfu/g of tissue in the lesion, spleen and liver. the infections with planktonic bacteria tended to become systemic and more deadly than biofilm infections. all infected wounds required the same healing period (30 days). these findings were independent of the origin of the bacteria (clinical or colony isolated strain).

TI  == bioprotection of golden delicious apples and iceberg lettuce against foodborne bacterial pathogens by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were isolated from fresh vegetables and fruit and its ability to inhibit the growth of foodborne human pathogens (escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, and staphylococcus aureus) was tested using the agar spot assay. eighteen isolates showed a strong antagonistic capacity and were further characterised and identified using 16s rdna sequencing and api 50ch. most of them pertained to leuconostoc spp. and lactobacillus plantarum, and a few corresponded to weissella spp. and lactococcus lactis. growth and efficacy of control of foodborne pathogen test bacteria by selected strains were tested in wounded golden delicious apples  and iceberg lettuce leaf cuts. the strains grew on the substrates and did not cause negative effects on the general aspect of tissues of apple or lettuce. treatment of apple wounds and lettuce cuts with the antagonistic strains reduced  the cell count of s. typhimurium and e .coli by 1 to 2 log cfu/wound or g, whereas the growth of l. monocytogenes was completely inhibited. results support  the potential use of lactic acid bacteria as bioprotective agents against foodborne human pathogens in ready-to-eat fresh fruit and vegetable products.

AB  == bacteriocin-producing strains of lactobacillus plantarum st23ld and st341ld, enterococcus faecium st311ld and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides st33ld were isolated from the brine of spoiled black olives. the bacteriocins produced by all four strains inhibited the growth of gram-positive bacteria (e. faecalis, l. casei and streptococcus pneumoniae), but also escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. strain st23ld produced two bacteriocins (st23lda and st23ldb of approximately 3.0 and 14.0 kda, respectively), with a combined maximum level of activity of 25,600 au/ml after 18 h of growth. the same level of activity was recorded for bacteriocin st341ld (approximately 3.0 kda), but after  16 h. bacteriocins st311ld (ca. 2.3 kda) and st33ld (ca. 2.7 kda) were produced at much lower levels (6400 au/ml), and only after 20 h of growth. bacteriocin activity was destroyed after treatment with proteolytic enzymes and triton x, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta, or when heated for 20 min at 121 degrees c. addition of bacteriocins st23ld, st341ld and st311ld to cells of lactobacillus casei lhs in logarithmic phase resulted in  growth inhibition for one hour, followed by a slight increase in optical density  over the next seven hours. bacteriocin st33ld also inhibited the growth of strain lhs, but to a lesser extent. bacteriocins st23ld, st341ld and st33ld remained at  the same level of activity for 6 h at ph<4.0. however, the activity of bacteriocin st311ld decreased by 50% within 2 h at ph 4.4. the possibility of the bacteriocin adsorbing to the producer cell and proteolytic degradation is unlikely.

TI  == interference of lactobacillus plantarum with pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro and  in infected burns: the potential use of probiotics in wound treatment.
AB  == this study evaluated the ability of the probiotic organism lactobacillus plantarum to inhibit the pathogenic activity of pseudomonas aeruginosa, both in vitro and in vivo, and investigated the mechanisms involved in such protection. l. plantarum whole cultures, culture filtrates (acid filtrate and neutralised acid filtrate) and isolated, washed cells were tested in vitro for their effects  on the production of the p. aeruginosa quorum-sensing signal molecules, acyl-homoserine-lactones (ahls), and two virulence factors controlled by these signal molecules, elastase and biofilm. all were inhibited by l. plantarum cultures and filtrates, but not by isolated, washed cells. the acid l. plantarum  growth medium itself had some inhibitory activity, but the greatest activity was  exerted by the whole culture. to test the in-vivo activity of l. plantarum, a burned-mouse model was used in which burns infected with p. aeruginosa were treated with l. plantarum at 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9 days post-infection. samples from skin, liver and spleen taken after 5, 10 and 15 days demonstrated inhibition of p. aeruginosa colonisation by l. plantarum. there was also an improvement in tissue repair, enhanced phagocytosis of p. aeruginosa by tissue phagocytes, and a decrease in apoptosis at 10 days. these results indicate that l. plantarum and/or its by-products are potential therapeutic agents for the local treatment of p. aeruginosa burn infections.

TI  == detection of low levels of listeria monocytogenes cells by using a fiber-optic immunosensor.
AB  == biosensor technology has a great potential to meet the need for sensitive and nearly real-time microbial detection from foods. an antibody-based fiber-optic biosensor to detect low levels of listeria monocytogenes cells following an enrichment step was developed. the principle of the sensor is a sandwich immunoassay where a rabbit polyclonal antibody was first immobilized on polystyrene fiber waveguides through a biotin-streptavidin reaction to capture listeria cells on the fiber. capture of cells on the fibers was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. a cyanine 5-labeled murine monoclonal antibody, c11e9, was used to generate a specific fluorescent signal, which was acquired by  launching a 635-nm laser light from an analyte 2000 and collected by a photodetector at 670 to 710 nm. this immunosensor was specific for l. monocytogenes and showed a significantly higher signal strength than for other listeria species or other microorganisms, including escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella enterica, lactobacillus plantarum, carnobacterium gallinarum, hafnia alvei, corynebacterium glutamicum, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens, in pure or in mixed-culture setup. fiber-optic results could be obtained within 2.5 h of sampling. the sensitivity threshold was about 4.3 x 10(3) cfu/ml for a pure culture of l. monocytogenes grown at 37 degrees c. when l. monocytogenes was mixed with lactic acid bacteria or grown at 10 degrees c with 3.5% nacl, the detection threshold was 4.1 x 10(4) or 2.8 x 10(7) cfu/ml, respectively. in less  than 24 h, this method could detect l. monocytogenes in hot dog or bologna naturally contaminated or artificially inoculated with 10 to 1,000 cfu/g after enrichment in buffered listeria enrichment broth.

TI  == commensal gram-negative bacteria prime human dendritic cells for enhanced il-23 and il-27 expression and enhanced th1 development.
AB  == dendritic cells (dc) are the main orchestrators of specific immune responses. depending on microbial information they encounter in peripheral tissues, they promote the development of th1, th2 or unpolarized th cell responses. in this study we have investigated the immunomodulatory effect of non-pathogenic intestinal gram-negative (escherichia coli, bacteroides vulgatus,veillonella parvula, pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram-positive (bifidobacterium adolescentis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus plantarum and staphylococcus aureus) bacteria on human monocyte-derived dc (modc). none of the gram-positive bacteria  (gpb) primed for th1 or th2 development. in contrast, despite the low levels of il-12 they induce, all gram-negative bacteria (gnb) primed modc for enhanced th1  cell development, which was dependent on il-12 and an additional unidentified cofactor. strikingly, gnb-matured modc expressed elevated levels of p19 and p28 mrna, the critical subunits of il-23 and il-27, respectively, suggesting that the il-12 family members may jointly be responsible for their th1-driving capacity. purified major cell wall components of either gnb or gpb did not yield th cell profiles identical to those obtained with whole bacteria, and could not explain the induction of the il-12 family members nor th1 priming by gnb. importantly, this study gives indications that the expression of the different il-12 family members is dictated by different priming conditions of immature dc.

AB  == the hygiene hypothesis postulates that the prevalence of allergy has increased due to decreased microbial stimulation early in life, leading to delayed maturation of the immune system. the aim of this study was to examine the cytokine pattern produced from cord blood mononuclear cells relative to adult cells after stimulation with bacterial strains from the normal flora. mononuclear cells from cord and adult blood samples were stimulated with the following bacteria: bifidobacterium adolescentis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus mitis, corynebacterium minutissimum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides vulgatus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, veillonella parvula, and neisseria sicca. the levels of interleukin 12 (il-12), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-10, and il-6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the tnf-alpha production was also analyzed after blocking cd14, toll-like receptor 2 (tlr-2), and tlr-4 prior to stimulation with bacteria. the levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha were similar in cord and adult cells. gram-positive bacteria induced considerably higher levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha than gram-negative bacteria in both cord and adult cells. the levels of il-6 were significantly higher in newborns than in adults, whereas the levels of  il-10 were similar in newborns and adults. gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria induced similar levels of il-6 and il-10 in cord cells. l. plantarum bound or signaled through cd14, tlr-2, and tlr-4, whereas e. coli acted mainly through cd14 and tlr-4. these results indicate that the innate immune response in newborns to commensal bacteria is strong and also suggest that different bacterial strains may have differential effects on the maturation of the immune system of infants.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of essential oils from plants against selected pathogenic  and saprophytic microorganisms.
AB  == the beneficial health effects of extracts from many types of plants that are used as seasoning agents in foods and beverages have been claimed for centuries. the purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of selected herb and spice essential oils for control of growth and survival of microorganisms. inhibition of growth was tested by the paper disc agar diffusion method. antibiotic susceptibility discs were used as control. minimum lethal concentration (mlc) was determined by the tube dilution method. essential oils from anise, angelica, basil, carrot, celery, cardamom, coriander, dill weed, fennel, oregano, parsley,  and rosemary were evaluated. inhibition ranged from complete with oregano to no inhibition with carrot oil for each of the test strains that included: listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o:157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, lactobacillus plantarum, aspergillus niger, geotrichum, and rhodotorula. oregano essential oil showed the greatest inhibition (zone, > or = 70 to 80 mm) (mlc, approximately 8 ppm). coriander and basil were also highly inhibitory (mlc, approximately 25 to 50 ppm) to e. coli o:157:h7 and to the other bacteria and fungi tested. anise oil was not particularly inhibitory to bacteria (inhibition zone, approximately 25 mm); however, anise oil was highly inhibitory to molds. because some of the herbal and spice essential oils are highly inhibitory to selected pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms, they may provide alternatives and supplements to conventional antimicrobial additives in foods.

TI  == identification of a non-haem catalase in salmonella and its regulation by rpos (sigmas).
AB  == we report the identification and functional analysis of katn, a gene encoding a non-haem catalase of salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium. katn, which is not present in escherichia coli, is located between the ycigfe and ycid e. coli homologues in the salmonella genome. its predicted protein product has a molecular weight of 31 826 da and is similar to the mn-catalases of lactobacillus plantarum and thermus spp. its product, katn, was visualized as a 37 kda protein  in e. coli maxicells. a katn recombinant protein, containing six histidine residues at its c-terminus, was purified, and its catalase activity was observed  on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. katn was also visualized by catalase activity gel staining of bacterial cell extracts. its expression was shown to be  regulated by growth phase and rpos. northern blotting indicated that kat forms an operon with the upstream ycigfe genes. a putative rpos-regulated promoter was identified upstream of ycig. southern blotting revealed that katn is conserved within salmonella serovars. katn homologues were found in pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens. a katn mutation did not appear to affect the hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) response of salmonella. however, the expression of katn increased the h2o2 resistance of unadapted cells in the exponential phase and of rpos mutants in stationary phase. thus, katn may contribute to hydrogen peroxide resistance in salmonella in certain environmental conditions.

TI  == molecular characterization of lactobacillus plantarum genes for beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase iii (fabh) and acetyl coenzyme a carboxylase (accbcda), which are essential for fatty acid biosynthesis.
AB  == genes for subunits of acetyl coenzyme a carboxylase (acc), which is the enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the synthesis of fatty acids in lactobacillus plantarum l137, were cloned and characterized. we identified six potential open reading frames, namely, manb, fabh, accb, accc, accd, and acca, in that order. nucleotide sequence analysis suggested that fabh encoded beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase iii, that the accb, accc, accd, and acca genes encoded biotin carboxyl carrier protein, biotin carboxylase, and the beta and alpha subunits of carboxyltransferase, respectively, and that these genes were clustered. the organization of acc genes was different from that reported for escherichia coli, for bacillus subtilis, and for pseudomonas aeruginosa. e. coli  accb and accd mutations were complemented by the l. plantarum accb and accd genes, respectively. the predicted products of all five genes were confirmed by using the t7 expression system in e. coli. the gene product of accb was biotinylated in e. coli. northern and primer extension analyses demonstrated that the five genes in l. plantarum were regulated polycistronically in an acc operon.

TI  == synergist effect of sucrose fatty acid esters on nisin inhibition of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == nisin in combination with the sucrose fatty acid esters, sucrose palmitate (p-1570 and p-1670) or sucrose stearate (s-1570 and s-1670) was tested against a  range of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. initial liquid culture investigation showed that the sugar ester p-1670 resulted in a synergist enhancement of the bacteriostatic activity of nisin against gram-positive bacteria and not gram-negative bacteria. some enhancement of the bactericidal activity of nisin against listeria monocytogenes was also observed. this increased nisin inhibitory effect was confirmed on solid media using plates with  gradients of ph and nacl. synergism was observed with all four sucrose fatty acid esters, which enhanced the antimicrobial activity of nisin against several strains of l. monocytogenes, bacillus cereus (both cells and spores), lactobacillus plantarum and staphylococcus aureus. the combination of nisin and the sucrose fatty acid esters showed no inhibition of gram-negative bacteria (salmonella enteritidis, salm. typhimurium and pseudomonas aeruginosa).

TI  == distribution of epiphytic bacteria on olive leaves and the influence of leaf age  and sampling time.
AB  == mesophilic heterotrophic, aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria that grow on yeast tryptone glucose extract agar were isolated from the surface of olive leaves of 3 or 4 different ages in january, april, july, and october from 1984 to 1989. unweighted average linkage cluster analysis on either the jaccard coefficient or the simple matching coefficient recovered 1,701 representative strains in 32 phena defined at the 70% and 80% similarity level, respectively. of these, 25 were identified to genus or lower level. from the identity of the representative strains, the frequency of occurrence among the phylloplane bacteria over the 6-year period was estimated at 51% forpseudomonas syringae, followed byxanthomonas campestris (6.7%),erwinia herbicola (6%),acetobacter aceti (4.7%),gluconobacter oxydans (4.3%),pseudomonas fluorescens (3.9%),bacillus megaterium (3.8%),leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp.dextranicum (3.1%),lactobacillus plantarum (2.8%),curtobacterium plantarum (2.2%),micrococcus luteus (2.2%),arthrobacter globiformis (1.4%),klebsiella planticola (1.2%),streptococcus faecium (1.2%),clavibacter sp. (0.98%),micrococcus sp. (0.82%),serratia marcescens (0.81%),bacillus subtilis (0.57%),cellulomonas flavigena (0.4%),erwinia sp. (0.37%),zymomonas mobilis (0.3%),bacillus sp. (0.29%),alcaligenes faecalis (0.27%),erwinia carotovora (0.08%), andpseudomonas aeruginosa (0.04%). bacterial communities on leaves of a given age at a given time during any one year displayed a very similar structure but differed significantly from those on the leaves of the same age at a different time or on  the leaves of a different age at any time during any one year. communities on the leaves of a given age at a given time of the year were invariably dominated by one or another of only 9 taxa, which accounted for 22 to 98.5% of the isolates from those leaves. the communities on 10- and 13-month-old leaves were invariably made up of fewer taxa than those on younger leaves at the same time of the year.

TI  == deconjugation of bile acids by human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the purpose of this report is to present the deconjugation of bile acids by numbers of strains of bacteria in the small intestine and feces. the small intestinal juice was aseptically aspirated by a double lumen tube with a rubber cover on the tip devised by us ("fukushima type 1"). bile acids were analyzed with thin layer chromatography. the results: 1) among aerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split conjugated bile acids was enterococcus, and most of the strains split were staphylococcus (s.) epidermidis and lactobacillus  (l.) bifidus. species of which none of the strains split were escherichia (e.) coli, e. communior, e. freundii, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. buchneri, l. cellobiosus, l. bulgaricus, s. aureus, aerobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida, proteus, serratia, and almost none of the species split was  intermediate coliform bacilli. 2) among anaerobic bacteria, species of which all  of the strains split were bacteroides (b.) vulgatus, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis, corynebacterium (c.) granulosum, c. avidum, peptostreptococcus (peptostrept.) putridus, eubacterium (eubact.) lentum, peptococcus (pept.) grigoroffii, pept. anaerobius, veillonella (v.) orbiculus, and most of the strains split were coryne. diphtheroides, eubact. parvum, peptostrept. intermedius. species of which none of the strains split were coryne, parvum, peptostrept. micros, v. alcalescens, v. parvula, catenabacterium (catena.) catenaforme, and catena. filamentosum. 3) all or none, or almost all or none, of  the strains of each species tested split conjugated bile acids, and it seems probably that the presence or absence of this ability would be a proper character of eachspecies.
