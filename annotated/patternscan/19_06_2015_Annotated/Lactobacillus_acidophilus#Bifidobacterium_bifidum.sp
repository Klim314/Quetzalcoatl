TI  == a randomized double-blind controlled trial of lactobacillus acidophilus plus bifidobacterium bifidum versus placebo in patients with hypercholesterolemia.
AB  == background: hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. not all patients respond well to traditional cholesterol lowering medications. probiotics have been evaluated for their cholesterol-lowering effects in humans with variable results. this study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of two probiotics in lowering the serum cholesterol of hypercholesterolemic patients. materials and methods: a randomized double-blind controlled trial was conducted comparing placebo to lactobacillus acidophilus plus bifidobacterium bifidum in patients diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia. placebo or probiotic capsules were taken three times daily for six weeks. pre- and post-treatment total cholesterol (tc), hdl-cholesterol (hdl-c), ldl-cholesterol (ldl-c) and triglyceride (tg) levels and demographic parameters of the two groups were compared. from a total of 70 participants, 64 completed the assigned treatment (31 in probiotics group and 33 in the control group).the two treatment groups were matched for age, sex, weight, height, bmi, waist and hip circumferences, and blood pressure. results: baseline evaluation revealed no  difference between the probiotics group and control group levels of tc, hdl-c, ldl-c and tg. tc levels in the probiotics group decreased during treatment (237.2 vs. 212.7 mg/dl, p<0.05). tc and ldl-c levels in the control group increased significantly from their baseline levels during treatment. tc (212.7 vs 252.8 mg/dl, p<0.001), hdl-c (52.0 vs 59.1 mg/dl, p=0.04) and ldl-c (153.9 vs 182.1 mg/dl, p<0.01) levels in the probiotics group were significantly lower at the end of treatment than the corresponding levels in the control group. conclusion: a combination of lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum decreased serum total cholesterol, ldl-cholesterol and hdl-cholesterol levels in hypercholesterolemic patients over a six week period. there was no effect on serum triglyceride or fasting blood glucose levels.

TI  == a randomized controlled trial to test the effect of multispecies probiotics on cognitive reactivity to sad mood.
AB  == background: recent insights into the role of the human microbiota in cognitive and affective functioning have led to the hypothesis that probiotic supplementation may act as an adjuvant strategy to ameliorate or prevent depression. objective: heightened cognitive reactivity to normal, transient changes in sad mood is an established marker of vulnerability to depression and is considered an important target for interventions. the present study aimed to test if a multispecies probiotic containing bifidobacterium bifidum w23, bifidobacterium lactis w52, lactobacillus acidophilus w37, lactobacillus brevis w63, lactobacillus casei w56, lactobacillus salivarius w24, and lactococcus lactis (w19 and w58) may reduce cognitive reactivity in non-depressed individuals. design: in a triple-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, pre- and  post-intervention assessment design, 20 healthy participants without current mood disorder received a 4-week probiotic food-supplement intervention with the multispecies probiotics, while 20 control participants received an inert placebo  for the same period. in the pre- and post-intervention assessment, cognitive reactivity to sad mood was assessed using the revised leiden index of depression  sensitivity scale. results: compared to participants who received the placebo intervention, participants who received the 4-week multispecies probiotics intervention showed a significantly reduced overall cognitive reactivity to sad mood, which was largely accounted for by reduced rumination and aggressive thoughts. conclusion: these results provide the first evidence that the intake of probiotics may help reduce negative thoughts associated with sad mood. probiotics supplementation warrants further research as a potential preventive strategy for  depression.

TI  == probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in older patients: a systematic review.
AB  == objective: here, we evaluated the efficacy of probiotic interventions in prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (aad) and clostridium difficile diarrhoea (cdd) in older patients. methods: pubmed, embase, central, cinahl, and  web of science were comprehensively searched from their dates of inception to may 2014. only randomised controlled trials reporting data on probiotics including lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, saccharomyces, streptococcus, enterococcus, and bacillus-alone or in combination-versus placebo or absence of treatment in older  patients (age >/=65 years) were included. risk ratios (rrs) for aad and cdd relative to placebo or absence of treatment were estimated. results: six trials with a total of 3562 patients were included. only one trial showed that bacillus  licheniformis was effective for preventing aad in older patients. however, there  was no preventive effect for aad and cdd with lactobacillus acidophilus (florajen), lactobacillus casei shirota, saccharomyces cerevisiae (boulardii) lyo, mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum (cultech strains), and mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus cul60, cul21, bifidobacterium  bifidum cul20 and b. lactis cul34. conclusions: our findings indicate that probiotics may not reduce the risk of aad and cdd in older patients. however, with current published data, it is difficult to draw concrete conclusions. to confirm these findings, sample sizes, multi-centre, double-blind studies that consider factors such as probiotic strains and types of antibiotics are required.

TI  == perioperative synbiotics decrease postoperative complications in periampullary neoplasms: a randomized, double-blind clinical trial.
AB  == periampullary neoplasms are rapidly progressive tumors with a poor prognosis and  high morbidity and mortality rates, which have a negative influence on patient outcomes. some probiotics and prebiotics have the ability to protect the intestinal barrier and prevent bacterial translocation, infection, and postoperative complications. we evaluated the use of synbiotics in a prospective, double-blind study of patients undergoing surgery for periampullary neoplasms (pns) and assessed the effect of these agents on nutritional status, postoperative complications, antibiotic use, length of hospital stay, and mortality. patients were randomized to receive probiotics and prebiotics-synbiotics--group s [lactobacillus acidophilus 10, 1 x 10(9)cfu, lactobacillus rhamnosus hs 111, 1 x 10(9) cfu, lactobacillus casei 10, 1 x 10(9)  cfu, bifidobacterium bifidum, 1 x 10(9)cfu, and fructooligosaccharides (fos) 100  mg]--or placebo-controls--group c, twice daily, for a total of 14 days. risk, clinical status, and postoperative complication rates were assessed. twenty-three patients were allocated to each group. the incidence of postoperative infection was significantly lower in group s (6 of 23 patients, 26.1%) than in group c (16  of 23 patients, 69.6%) (p = 0.00). duration of antibiotic therapy was also shorter in group s (mean = 9 days vs. 15 days in group c; p = 0.01). noninfectious complications were less common in group s (6 of 23 vs. 14 of 23 patients in group c; p = 0.03). mean length of hospital stay was 12 +/- 5 days in group s vs. 23 +/- 14 days in group c (p = 0.00). no deaths occurred in group s,  whereas 6 deaths occurred in group c (p = 0.02). perioperative administration of  synbiotics reduces postoperative mortality and complication rates in patients undergoing surgery for pns.

TI  == cocktails of probiotics pre-adapted to multiple stress factors are more robust under simulated gastrointestinal conditions than their parental counterparts and  exhibit enhanced antagonistic capabilities against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == background: the success of the probiotics in delivery of health benefits depends  on their ability to withstand the technological and gastrointestinal conditions;  hence development of robust cultures is critical to the probiotic industry. combinations of probiotic cultures have proven to be more effective than the use  of single cultures for treatment and prevention of heterogeneous diseases. we investigated the effect of pre- adaptation of probiotics to multiple stresses on  their stability under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and the effect of their singular as well as their synergistic antagonistic effect against selected  enteric pathogens. methods: probiotic cultures were inoculated into mrs broth adjusted to ph 2 and incubated for 2 h at 37 degrees c. survivors of ph 2 were subcultured into 2% bile acid for 1 h at 37 degrees c. cells that showed growth after exposure to 2% bile acid for 1 h were finally inoculated in fresh mrs broth and incubated at 55 degrees c for 2 h. the cells surviving were then used as stress adapted cultures. the adapted cultures were exposed to simulated gastrointestinal conditions and their non- adapted counterparts were used to compare the effects of stress adaptation. the combination cultures were tested for their antipathogenic effects on escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. results: acid and bile tolerances of most of the stress-adapted cells were higher than of the non-adapted cells. viable counts of all the stress-adapted lactobacilli and bifidobacterium longum lmg 13197 were higher after sequential exposure to simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. however, for b. longum bb46  and b. bifidum lmg 13197, viability of non-adapted cells was higher than for adapted cells after exposure to these fluids. a cocktail containing l. plantarum  + b. longum bb46 + b. longum lmg 13197 best inhibited s. aureus while e. coli was best inhibited by a combination containing l. acidophilus la14 150b + b. longum bb46 + b. bifidum lmg 11041. a cocktail containing the six non- adapted cultures  was the least effective in inhibiting the pathogens. conclusion: multi-stress pre-adaptation enhances viability of probiotics under simulated gastrointestinal  conditions; and formulations containing a mixture of multi stress-adapted cells exhibits enhanced synergistic effects against foodborne pathogens.

TI  == [biological effect of extracellular peptide factor from lateococcus japonicas subsp. casei on probiotic bacteria].
AB  == the biological effect of the extracellular peptide reactivating factor (rf) from  luteococcus casei on cells of probiotic cultures was studied. the rf showed the protective and reactivating effects on the bifidobacterium bifidum cells under the action of bile salts and an acidic stress. also, it acted as a cryoprotector  during lyophilisation and long-term culture storage. the rf and the l. casei culture liquid (cl) were shown to have bifidogenic properties. the degree of protection and reactivation of lactic-acid bacteria under the action of bile salts depended on the particular strain properties. the maximum degree of protection (more than thirteen-fold) and reactivation (close to three-fold) was found in lactobacillus casei, while the minimum values were characteristic of lactobacillus reuterii. the resistance of lactobacilli to bile was increased in the row of l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, and l. reuterii  correlating with the rf protection degree.

TI  == bioactivity of water soluble extracts and some characteristics of white cheese during the ripening period as effected by packaging type and probiotic adjunct cultures.
AB  == in this study, the chemical composition, proteolysis and in vitro angiotensin-converting enzyme-(ace)-inhibitory and antioxidant activities of white cheeses made using probiotic adjunct cultures (bifidobacterium bifidum dsmz 20456 and lactobacillus acidophilus dsmz 20079) were investigated. the cheeses were ripened in a vacuum package or brine for 120 d at 4 degrees c. the cheese samples maintained the probiotic characteristics of the viable cells as >106 cfu/g even after ripening for 120 d. the proteolysis degrees in terms of water-soluble nitrogen/total nitrogen (wsn/tn), trichloroacetic acid-soluble nitrogen/total nitrogen (tca-sn/tn) and phosphotungstic acid-soluble nitrogen/total nitrogen (pta-sn/tn) values in the cheeses increased throughout the ripening. the highest levels of proteolysis were found in cheese made using lb. acidophilus dsmz 20079 and ripened in a vacuum package. ace-inhibitory activity of the water soluble extracts (wses) of the cheeses increased significantly (p < 0.05) throughout the ripening (ic50 values 82.78-140.99 mug/ml). use of lb. acidophilus dsmz 20079 and packaging under vacuum significantly increased the percentage of ace inhibiting activity. wses had dpph  scavenging activity (the ic50 values were 2.41-5.39 mg/ml and the inhibition values were 5.10-10.38%), increasing up to 60 d ripening. in the present study, it was observed that lb. acidophilus dsmz 20079 was more effective than bifido. bifidum dsmz 20456 in terms of the cheese characteristics investigated.

TI  == effect of probiotic supplementation on bacterial translocation in common bile duct obstruction.
AB  == objective: to investigate the effects of probiotics on bacterial translocation in the obstructive common bile duct with comparison to an enteral product containing arginine and glutamine. material and method: in our study, 40 sprague-dawley rats each weighing 250-300 g were used. animals in group 1 (sham) were laparatomized and fed standard chow supplemented with physiologic saline at daily doses of 2 ml through orogastric tube for 7 days. common bile ducts of the animals in the other groups were ligated with 3/0 silk sutures. group 2 (control group) was fed standard chow supplemented with daily doses of 2 ml physiologic saline. group 3 (probiotic group) was fed standard chow supplemented with a probiotic solution (acidophilus plus) containing strains of lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium bifidum and lactobacillus bulgaricus at a daily doses of 2 x 10(9) colony forming units (cfu). group 4 (formula group) was fed only an enteral solution (stresson multi fiber) containing glutamine, arginine and a medium-chain fatty acid at daily doses of 2 g/kg. at the end of the 7th day, all animals were  relaparatomized, and to determine bacterial translocation, aerobic, and anaerobic cultures were obtained from the specimens of mesenteric lymph nodes, intestinal mucosa, and blood samples. smear cultures prepared from caecum were examined to determine the number of cfu. finally, for histological examination specimens were excised from terminal ileum, and oxidative damage was assessed in liver tissues.  afterwards all animals were killed. results: moderately lesser degrees of bacterial translocation, and mucosal damage were seen in groups 3, and 4 relative to group 2 (p < 0.05). in group 4, any difference was not seen in the number of cecal bacteria relative to baseline values, while in group 3, significant decrease in cecal colonization was seen. among all groups, a significant difference between levels of malondialdehyde, and glutathione was not observed. conclusion: at the end of our study, we have concluded that both probiotics, and  enteral diets which contain immunomodulators such as glutamine, and arginine alleviate bacterial translocation, and impairment of intestinal mucosa.

TI  == performance evaluation of bulk freeze dried starter cultures of dahi and yoghurt  along with probiotic strains in standardized milk of cow and buffalo.
AB  == performance of bulk freeze dried (bfd) cultures of dahi (d) and yoghurt (y) either with or without probiotic cultures (ab -lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum) in standardized milk of cow and buffalo was evaluated. in buffalo milk, significantly (p < 0.05) low viable count of probiotic culture combination of dahi cultures (dab) over non probiotic combination (d) was noticed; whereas, difference in counts of yoghurt culture combinations y and yab  was not significant. the culture activity of d and dab was similar in both types  of milk, however, the volatile acidity (va) produced by combination d was higher  (32.5 ml/50 g sample) in buffalo milk than in cow milk (29.2 ml/50 g sample). whereas, dab produced very low amount of va (16 ml/50 g sample) both in cow and buffalo milk. the diacetyl and tyrosine contents produced by either d or dab in cow or buffalo milk were in the same order. although y and yab produced slightly  more va in buffalo milk than in cow milk, significant change in the performance of yoghurt cultures (y or yab) both in cow and buffalo milk was not noticed. however, the va and acetaldehyde produced by yab either in cow and buffalo milk was higher than that by combination y. addition of probiotic cultures significantly enhanced the production of acetaldehyde content in both types of milk. difference in tyrosine content in yoghurt made either with cow or buffalo milk was not significant. overall, the present study indicated that the bfd cultures can be used to prepare dahi or yoghurt either from cow or buffalo milk,  without affecting the biochemical profile of these products.

TI  == probiotics (lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum) prevent nec in vlbw infants fed breast milk but not formula.
AB  == background: specific probiotics prevent necrotizing enterocolitis (nec). a mixture of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria (infloran) was highly effective in asian very-low-birth-weight (vlbw) infants. we analyzed the effect of infloran on nec, nec severity, and the influence of enteral feedings (breast milk vs. formula) on nec prevention in a cohort of european vlbw infants. methods: infloran was implemented for routine use at our department. vlbw infants receiving probiotics were prospectively followed (2010-2012) and compared with historic controls (2008-2009). data on nec, neonatal morbidity, feeding tolerance, and descriptive parameters on nec cases were analyzed. results: infloran had no statistically significant impact on nec (controls: 24/233 (10.3%); probiotics: 16/230 (7%); p = 0.2). however, nec was significantly reduced in infants of the probiotics group who were fed any breast milk (20/179 (11.2%) vs. 10/183 (5.5%); p = 0.027), whereas it was ineffective in infants exclusively fed formula (4/54 (7.4%) vs. 6/44 (13.6%); p = 0.345). occurrence of  severe nec (iiib), time until full feeds, and gastric residuals were similar. conclusion: infloran was of lower efficacy in a european vlbw cohort and showed a reduction of nec only in infants fed breast milk. future studies should investigate the influence of feeding formula or breast milk on the effect of probiotics.

TI  == effect of oral probiotics supplementation in the prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis among very low birth weight preterm infants.
AB  == background: necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) is the most serious gastrointestinal  problem in very low birth weight preterm infants. multiple risk factors activate  the inflammatory cascade leading to high expressions of pro-inflammatory mediators causing bowel injury in nec. the anti-inflammatory effect of probiotics is due to the inhibition and reduction of inflammatory signal in intestinal epithelium. objective: to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics supplementation in  the prevention of nec among very low birth weight preterm infants. study design:  a prospective randomized controlled trial. material and method: all preterm infants with gestational age less than or equal to 34 weeks and birth weight less than or equal to 1,500 grams admitted in neonatal care unit, queen sirikit national institute of child health during june 1st, 2012 and january 31th, 2013 were enrolled in this study. they were randomized into two groups, study and control group. infants in the study group were fed infloran (lactobacillus acidophilus 1 x 10(9) and bifidobacterium bifidum 1 x 10(9) organisms) dose 125 mg/kg/dose twice a day with breast milk or premature formula from the start of feeding until 6 weeks or discharge. infants in the control group were fed with either breast milk or premature formula alone. the primary outcome was nec stage  >/= 2. results: sixty infants completed the study, 31 infants in the study group  and 29 infants in the control group. the baseline characteristic data of infants  were similar except for more males in the present study group. incidence of nec stage >/= 2 were similar in both the groups, 3.2 vs. 3.4% (p = 0.74). there were  no deaths during the study period. days to reach full feeding, 150 ml/kg/day, were no differences between the two groups, 12.03 +/- 5.49 days vs. 13.76 +/- 8.25 days (p = 0.31). no adverse effects such as sepsis, flatulence or diarrhea were noted. conclusion: in this study, there was no difference in incidence of nec stage >/= 2 between the two groups. no adverse effects of probiotics supplementation were observed.

TI  == short-term probiotic therapy alleviates small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, but does not improve intestinal permeability in chronic liver disease.
AB  == aim: : although numerous animal studies suggest that probiotic therapy has beneficial effects in various liver diseases, the evidence for beneficial effects in human liver disease is controversial. this study was carried out to investigate the efficacy of probiotic therapy in alleviating small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (sibo) and permeability in chronic liver disease. methods: fifty-three patients with chronic liver disease were randomized to either probiotic therapy or placebo. six bacterial species were used: bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and streptococcus thermophilus. after 4 weeks, changes in the composition of fecal bacteria, sibo, intestinal permeability, and clinical symptoms were examined. results: three of the six probiotic species, b. lactis, l. rhamnosus, and l. acidophilus, increased in the  feces of the probiotic therapy group (p<0.001), whereas there was no change in fecal microbiota in the placebo group. sibo disappeared in many individuals of the probiotic therapy group, but none in the placebo (24 vs. 0%, p<0.05). general gastrointestinal symptoms also improved more in the probiotic group and improvement in intestinal permeability was slightly but not significantly more frequent in the probiotic arm than the placebo arm (50 vs. 31.3%, p=0.248). numbers of lactobacilli in stool were correlated negatively with intestinal permeability (p for trend<0.05). liver chemistry did not improve significantly in either group. conclusions: we conclude that short-term probiotic administration in chronic liver disease is effective in alleviating sibo and clinical symptoms,  but ineffective in improving intestinal permeability and liver function.

TI  == probiotic bifidobacterium species stimulate human slc26a3 gene function and expression in intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  == slc26a3, or downregulated in adenoma (dra), plays a major role in mediating cl(-) absorption in the mammalian intestine. disturbances in dra function and expression have been implicated in intestinal disorders such as congenital cl(-)  diarrhea and gut inflammation. we previously showed that an increase in dra function and expression by lactobacillus acidophilus and its culture supernatant  (cs) might underlie antidiarrheal effects of this probiotic strain. however, the  effects of bifidobacterium species, important inhabitants of the human colon, on  intestinal cl(-)/hco3 (-) exchange activity are not known. our current results demonstrate that cs derived from bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, and bifidobacterium bifidum increased anion exchange activity in caco-2 cells ( approximately 1.8- to 2.4-fold). consistent with the increase in dra function, cs also increased the protein, as well as the mrna, level of dra (but not putative anion transporter 1). cs of all three bifidobacterium sp. increased dra promoter  activity (-1,183/+114 bp) in caco-2 cells (1.5- to 1.8-fold). furthermore, the increase in dra mrna expression by cs of b. breve and b. infantis was blocked in  the presence of the transcription inhibitor actinomycin d (5 mum) and the erk1/2  mapk pathway inhibitor u0126 (10 mum). administration of live b. breve, b. infantis, and b. bifidum by oral gavage to mice for 24 h increased dra mrna and protein levels in the colon. these data demonstrate an upregulation of dra via activation of the erk1/2 pathway that may underlie potential antidiarrheal effects of bifidobacterium sp.

TI  == a multispecies probiotic reduces oral candida colonization in denture wearers.
AB  == purpose: the prevalence of candida infections has been rising with an increasingly aging population and a larger population of immunocompromised individuals. the use of probiotics may be an alternative approach to antifungal agents in the prevention and treatment of oral candidiasis. this study aimed to evaluate the short-term effect of probiotics in reducing the infection level of oral candida in candidiasis-asymptomatic elderly denture wearers. materials and methods: in a double-blind randomized study, 59 denture wearers harboring candida spp. in the oral cavity with no clinical symptoms were allocated into two groups: probiotic and placebo. all patients were instructed to clean the denture daily. the probiotic group poured a capsule containing lyophilized lactobacillus rhamnosus hs111, lactobacillus acidophillus hs101, and bifidobacterium bifidum daily on the palatal surface of the maxillary denture, whereas the placebo group  was submitted to the same regimen using placebo capsules. candida spp. infection  levels were evaluated in palate mucosa samples obtained before and after a 5-week experimental period. results: all patients harbored candida in the palate mucosa  at baseline. fifty-five individuals completed the experimental period. the detection rate of candida spp. was 92.0% in the placebo group after the experimental period, whereas it was reduced to 16.7% in the probiotic group. the  reduction promoted by the probiotic regimen was independent of baseline characteristics such as candida infection level and colonizing species, age of denture, and other variables. conclusion: the probiotic product was effective in  reducing the colonization of the oral cavity with candida in candidiasis-asymptomatic elderly denture wearers, suggesting that this multispecies probiotic could be used to prevent oral candidiasis. clinical implications: colonization of oral surfaces by candida is considered a risk factor for invasive fungal infections. the use of a product with l. rhamnosus, l. acidophilus, and b. bifidum may represent an alternative treatment for reduction  of candida infections in elderly denture wearers.

AB  == bovine lactoferrin (blf) is a natural glycoprotein, and it shows broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. however, reports on the influences of blf on probiotic bacteria have been mixed. we examined the effects of apo-blf (between 0.25 and 128 mg/ml) on both aerobic and anaerobic cultures of probiotics. we found that blf had similar effects on the growth of probiotics under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, and that it actively and significantly (at concentrations of >0.25 mg/ml) retarded the growth rate of bifidobacterium bifidum (atcc 29521), b. longum (atcc 15707), b. lactis (bcrc 17394), b. infantis (atcc 15697), lactobacillus reuteri (atcc 23272), l. rhamnosus (atcc 53103), and l. coryniformis (atcc 25602) in a dose-dependent manner. otherwise, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were 128 or >128 mg/ml against b. bifidum, b. longum, b. lactis, l. reuteri, and l. rhamnosus (atcc 53103). with regard to mics, blf showed at least four-fold lower inhibitory effect on probiotics than on pathogens. intriguingly, blf (>0.25 mg/ml) significantly enhanced the growth of rhamnosus (atcc 7469) and l. acidophilus (bcrc 14065) by approximately 40-200 %,  during their late periods of growth. supernatants produced from aerobic but not anaerobic cultures of l. acidophilus reduced the growth of escherichia coli by about 20 %. thus, blf displayed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the growth  of most probiotic strains under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. an antibacterial supernatant prepared from the aerobic cultures may have significant practical use.

TI  == dahi containing lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum improves phagocytic potential of macrophages in aged mice.
AB  == the present study investigated the effect of dahi containing potential probiotic  bacterial strains on macrophage functions in ageing mice. probiotic dahi was prepared by co-culturing dahi bacteria (lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis biovar diacetylactis) along with lactobacillus acidophilus lavk2 (la-dahi) or combined l. acidophilus lavk2 and bifidobacterium  bifidum bbvk3 (labb-dahi) in buffalo milk. the effect of ageing on phagocytic function was evaluated on 4 mo, 12 mo and 16 mo old mice. the effect of probiotic dahi was evaluated for macrophage functions in ageing mice (12 mo old) fed la-dahi or labb-dahi supplements for 4 months. the production of extracellular superoxide and h2o2 declined in peritoneal macrophages but enhanced in splenic macrophages, while intracellular superoxide declined in both peritoneal and splenic macrophages with ageing in mice. a decline in phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages was also observed in aged mice. supplementation of diet with la-dahi or labb-dahi for 4 months improved production of reactive oxygen species and phagocytic and adherence indices of peritoneal macrophages in aged mice. these results suggest that oral administration of la-dahi or labb-dahi has  potential to improve immune functions in ageing individuals.

TI  == comparative determination of two probiotics by qcm and owls-based immunosensors.
AB  == the regular consumption of foods containing probiotic bacteria has beneficial physiological effects on the health and the digestion system. there is a need for novel analytical approaches for the determination of these bacteria that are faster than the classical plate counting method. for this purpose, two label-free biosensors were investigated and presented in this paper: quartz crystal microbalance (qcm) and optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy (owls) based direct immunosensors were developed for real-time direct detection of probiotic bacteria in fermented dairy products. bifidobacterium bifidum o1356 and lactobacillus acidophilus o1132 were detected by polyclonal anti-b. bifidum igg and anti-l. acidophilus igg immobilized on the sensors' surface. sulfo-lc-spdp cross linking agent was used to bind antibodies to the gold surface of the qcm's  at-cut quartz wafer. concerning owls, antibodies were covalently bound to the amino groups of the silanized surface of the waveguide by glutaraldehyde. the dynamic measuring range was found between 1.0e+3 and 5.0e+5cfuml(-1) in 100 fold  diluted fermented milk products by qcm and with owls. considering the current legislation of the probiotic content in probiotic products, the two developed immunosensors can be applied for rapid quantification of l. acidophilus and b. bifidum in fermented milk. these examinations offer effective alternatives to the microbiological plate counting method.

TI  == probiotic dahi containing lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum modulates the formation of aberrant crypt foci, mucin-depleted foci, and cell proliferation on 1,2-dimethylhydrazine-induced colorectal carcinogenesis in wistar rats.
AB  == aberrant crypt foci (acf) and mucin-depleted foci (mdf) are pre-neoplastic lesions identified in the colon of carcinogen-treated rodents and in humans at high risk for colon cancer. the present study was carried out to divulge the protective potential of the probiotic dahi containing lactobacillus acidophilus lavk2 and bifidobacterium bifidum bbvk3 alone or in combination with piroxicam (pxc) on the development of early biomarkers of colorectal carcinogenesis in male wistar rats administered 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh). dmh was injected subcutaneously at the rate of 40 mg/kg body weight per animal twice a week for 2  weeks. a total of 120 male wistar rats were randomly allocated to five groups, each group having 24 animals. the rats were fed with buffalo milk or probiotic supplement (20 grams) alone or as an adjunct with pxc in addition to a basal diet ad libitum for 32 weeks. group i was offered buffalo milk (bm) and served as the  control group. group ii was administered dmh along with bm and served as the dmh-control group; group iii was administered bm-dmh-pxc, in which besides administering bm-dmh, pxc was also offered. group iv was offered probiotic labb dahi and dmh, and group v was offered both probiotic labb dahi and pxc along with dmh. the rats were euthanized at the 8(th), 16(th), and 32(nd) week of the experiment and examined for development of acf, aberrant crypts per acf (ac/acf), mucin-depleted foci (mdf), large mdf, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna) labeling index. administration of dmh in rats induced pre-neoplastic lesions (acf and mdf) and increased the pcna index in colorectal tissue. a significant (p<0.05) reduction in the number of acf, ac/acf, mdf, large mdf, and  pcna labeling index were observed in the probiotic labb dahi group compared with  the dmh control group. feeding rats with labb dahi or treatment with pxc diminished the initiation and progression of dmh-induced pre-neoplastic lesions and the pcna index, and treatment with labb dahi and pxc combined was significantly more effective. the dietary intervention of probiotics and pxc significantly protects against the development of crc in the rat-dmh model. these observations suggest that probiotic labb dahi alone or as an adjunct with pxc may have anti-neoplastic and anti-proliferative activities. moreover, probiotic labb  dahi possesses the medicinal properties to prevent colorectal carcinogenesis.

TI  == effect of denak (oliveria decumbens vent) on growth and survival of lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum for production of probiotic herbal milk and yoghurt.
AB  == this study was undertaken to determine the suitability of different doses (0, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5%) of denak powder (oliveria decumbens vent) on viability of lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum in milk and yoghurt during  21 day refrigerated storage for production of probiotic herbal milk and yoghurt.  in order to determine the effect of different doses of denak powder on growth of  probiotic bacteria in milk and yoghurt, first lyophilized bacteria lactobacillus  acidophilus was added to 1 liter of low fat sterilized milk and was considered as control. denak powder at the concentrations of 0.5, 1 and 1.5% were added to the  samples and incubated until acidity reached 40 degrees dornic and then left in refrigerator. similar procedure was applied to the bacteria bifidobacterium bifidum. the results of this experiment indicate the positive correlation between increased bacterial growth and increased denak concentration. the investigation showed that the yoghurt containing 1% denak powder had the best for taste, color, and insolubility. the sample with 1.5% denak powder in milk and yoghurt had greater viscosity than the other samples investigated. the shelf lives of products were determined to be 21 days during which the bacterial count decreased but not less than 10(9). all the results suggest that denak (oliveria decumbens vent) promoted the metabolism of lactic acid bacteria in milk and yoghurt. according to these findings, addition of denak powder to milk and yoghurt can be  recommended to take advantage of their beneficial properties on human health attributed to antimicrobial activities.

TI  == probiotic supplement consumption alters cytokine production from peripheral blood mononuclear cells: a preliminary study using healthy individuals.
AB  == the objective of this study was to examine the effect of daily probiotic supplementation upon the immune profile of healthy participants by the assessment of ex vivo cytokine production. twenty healthy adult volunteers received a multi-strain probiotic supplement consisting of two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus (cul60 and cul21), bifidobacterium lactis (cul34) and bifidobacterium bifidum (cul20) and fructooligosaccharide for 12 weeks. blood samples were collected at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks. peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) were isolated and cultured ex vivo in the presence or absence of lipopolysaccharide and cytokine production was assessed. postintervention, a significant decrease in the production of interleukin-6 and interleukin-1beta was apparent when pbmcs were incubated in the presence of lipopolysaccharide, whilst  a significant increase in il-10 and transforning growth factor-beta production was seen when the cells were incubated without an additional stimulus. this preliminary study demonstrates the potential of a multi-strain probiotic supplement to alter the immune response as demonstrated by changes in ex vivo cytokine production. such results demonstrate the potential benefit of probiotic  supplementation for healthy individuals and warrants further investigation.

TI  == role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature  search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment  of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase  production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in  vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with  s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between  probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.

TI  == antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

TI  == exploring the ameliorative potential of probiotic dahi containing lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum on dextran sodium sulphate induced colitis in mice.
AB  == conventional medical therapies for ulcerative colitis (uc) are still limited due  to the adverse side effects like dose-dependent diarrhoea and insufficient potency to keep in remission for long-term periods. so, new alternatives that provide more effective and safe therapies for ulcerative colitis are constantly being sought. in the present study, probiotic labb dahi was selected for investigation of its therapeutic effect on dss-induced colitis model in mice. labb dahi was prepared by co-culturing dahi culture of lactococci along with selected strain of lactobacillus acidophilus lavk2 and bifidobacterium bifidum bbvk3 in buffalo milk. four groups of mice (12 each) were fed for 17 d with buffalo milk (normal control), buffalo milk plus dss (colitis control), dahi plus dss, and labb dahi plus dss, respectively, with basal diet. the disease activity  scores, weight loss, organ weight, colon length, myeloperoxidase (mpo) and beta-glucoronidase activity was assessed, and the histopathological picture of the colon of mice was studied. all colitis control mice evidenced significant increase in mpo, beta-glucoronidase activity and showed high disease activity scores along with histological damage to colonic tissue. feeding with labb dahi offered significant reduction in mpo activity, beta-glucoronidase activity and improved disease activity scores. we found significant decline in length of colon, organ weight and body weight in colitis induced controls which were improved significantly by feeding labb dahi. the present study suggests that labb dahi can be used as a potential nutraceutical intervention to combat uc related changes and may offer effective adjunctive treatment for management of uc.

TI  == hypolipidemic effects of lactic acid bacteria fermented cereal in rats.
AB  == background: the objectives of the present study were to investigate the efficacy  of the mixed culture of lactobacillus acidophilus (dsm 20242), bifidobacterium bifidum (dsm 20082) and lactobacillus helveticus (ck60) in the fermentation of maize and the evaluation of the effect of the fermented meal on the lipid profile of rats. methods: rats were randomly assigned to 3 groups and each group placed on a diet a (high fat diet into which a maize meal fermented with a mixed culture of lb acidophilus (dsm 20242), b bifidum (dsm 20082) and lb helveticus (ck 60) was incorporated), b (unfermented high fat diet) or c (commercial rat chow) respectively after the first group of 7 rats randomly selected were sacrificed to obtain the baseline data. thereafter 7 rats each from the experimental and control groups were sacrificed weekly for 4 weeks and the plasma, erythrocytes, lipoproteins and organs of the rats were assessed for cholesterol, triglyceride and phospholipids. results: our results revealed that the mixed culture of lb acidophilus (dsm 20242), b bifidum (dsm 20082) and lb helveticus (ck 60) were able to grow and ferment maize meal into 'ogi' of acceptable flavour. in addition to plasma and hepatic hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, phospholipidosis in plasma, as well as cholesterogenesis, triglyceride constipation and phospholipidosis in extra-hepatic tissues characterized the consumption of unfermented hyperlipidemic diets. however, feeding the animals with the fermented maize diet reversed the dyslipidemia. conclusion: the findings of this study indicate that consumption of mixed culture lactic acid bacteria (lb acidophilus (dsm 20242), bifidobacterium bifidum (dsm 20082) and lb helveticus (ck 60) fermented food results in the inhibition of fat absorption. it also inhibits the activity of hmg coa reductase. this inhibition may be by feedback inhibition or repression of the transcription of the gene encoding the enzyme via activation of the sterol regulatory element binding protein (srebp) transcription factor. it is also possible that consumption of fermented food enhances conversion of cholesterol to bile acids by activating cholesterol-7alpha-hydroxylase.

TI  == mucosal immunology and probiotics.
AB  == the cross-talk between the mucosa-associated immune system and microbiota is critical in mucosal tissue homeostasis as well as in protection against infectious and inflammatory diseases occurring at mucosal sites. this recent evidence has paved the way to therapeutic approaches aimed at modulating the mucosa-associated immune system using probiotics. different strains of probiotics possess the ability to finely regulate dendritic cell (dc) activation, polarizing the subsequent t cell activity toward th1 (e.g. lactobacillus (lb) acidophilus),  th2 (lb.reuteri and bifidobacterium bifidum) or, as more recently demonstrated, th17 responses induced by specific strains such as lb.rhamnosus gg and lac23a, the latter isolated in our laboratory. here, we review some recent advances in our understanding of probiotics effects on mucosal immunology, particularly on cells of the innate immunity such as dcs. we also highlight our own experiences in modulating dc functions by commensal bacteria and discuss the relevance of probiotics administration in the treatment of human immunopathologies.

TI  == effect of a synbiotic on microbial community structure in a continuous culture model of the gastric microbiota in enteral nutrition patients.
AB  == patients with dysphagia require long-term nutritional support. this can be delivered by the enteral route via a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (peg) tube. enteral nutrition (en) bypasses the body's innate defences that prevent the microbial colonization of the proximal gut, which predisposes to microbial overgrowth. a continuous culture model simulating the upper gastrointestinal tract microbiota of en patients was used to investigate the effects of a synbiotic (lactobacillus acidophilus dun-311, bifidobacterium bifidum bb-02, bifidobacterium lactis bl-01, synergy 1) on microbial community structure and metabolism. a peg tube was inserted into the fermenters to study biofilm formation. the synbiotic delivered in sterile semi-skimmed milk (sssm) was introduced either 48 h prior to or after peg tube insertion. the synbiotic reduced biofilm formation on peg tube surfaces, with suppression of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae when it was added subsequent to peg insertion. when synbiotic feeding was commenced prior to peg insertion, colonization by staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans and candida famata was also inhibited. lactate production increased in response the synbiotic or control (sssm). these results indicate that the use of a synbiotic has the potential to reduce pathogen colonization on peg tube surfaces in vivo, thereby reducing the incidence of biofilm-related infectious complications.

AB  == dendritic cells (dc) play a pivotal regulatory role in activation of both the innate as well as the adaptive immune system by responding to environmental microorganisms. we have previously shown that lactobacillus acidophilus induces a strong production of the pro-inflammatory and th1 polarizing cytokine il-12 in dc, whereas bifidobacteria do not induce il-12 but inhibit the il-12 production induced by lactobacilli. in the present study, genome-wide microarrays were used  to investigate the gene expression pattern of murine dc stimulated with lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium bifidum z9. l. acidophilus ncfm strongly induced expression of interferon (ifn)-beta, other virus defence genes, and cytokine and chemokine genes related to the innate and the adaptive immune response. by contrast, b. bifidum z9 up-regulated genes encoding cytokines and chemokines related to the innate immune response. moreover, b. bifidum z9 inhibited the expression of the th1-promoting genes induced by l. acidophilus ncfm and had an additive effect on genes of the innate immune response and th2 skewing genes. the gene encoding jun dimerization protein 2 (jdp2), a transcription factor regulating the activation of jnk, was one of the few genes only induced by b. bifidum z9. neutralization of ifn-beta abrogated l. acidophilus ncfm-induced expression of th1-skewing genes, and blocking of the jnk pathway completely inhibited the expression of ifn-beta. our results indicate that b. bifidum z9 actively inhibits the expression of genes related to the adaptive immune system in murine dendritic cells and that jpd2 via blocking of ifn-beta plays a central role in this regulatory mechanism.

TI  == lactobacillus acidophilus induces virus immune defence genes in murine dendritic  cells by a toll-like receptor-2-dependent mechanism.
AB  == lactobacilli are probiotics that, among other health-promoting effects, have been ascribed immunostimulating and virus-preventive properties. certain lactobacillus spp. have been shown to possess strong interleukin-12 (il-12) -inducing properties. as il-12 production depends on the up-regulation of type i interferons (ifns), we hypothesized that the strong il-12-inducing capacity of lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm in murine bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (dcs) is caused by an up-regulation of ifn-beta, which subsequently induces il-12 and the double-stranded rna binding toll-like receptor-3 (tlr-3). the expression  of the genes encoding ifn-beta, tlr-3, il-12 and il-10 in dcs upon stimulation with l. acidophilus ncfm was determined. lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm induced a much stronger expression of ifn-beta, il-12 and il-10 compared with the synthetic double-stranded rna ligand poly i:c, whereas the levels of expressed tlr-3 were similar. whole genome microarray gene expression analysis revealed that other genes related to viral defence were significantly up-regulated and among the strongest induced genes in dcs stimulated with l. acidophilus ncfm. the ability to induce ifn-beta was also detected in another l. acidophilus strain (x37), but  was not a property of other probiotic strains tested, i.e. bifidobacterium bifidum z9 and escherichia coli nissle 1917. the ifn-beta expression was markedly reduced in tlr-2(-/-) dcs, dependent on endocytosis, and the major cause of the induction of il-12 and tlr-3 in dcs stimulated with l. acidophilus ncfm. collectively, our results reveal that certain lactobacilli trigger the expression of viral defence genes in dcs in a tlr-2 manner dependent on ifn-beta.

TI  == anti-inflammatory properties of probiotic bacteria on salmonella-induced il-8 synthesis in enterocyte-like caco-2 cells.
AB  == invasion of the gut by pathogenic salmonella leads to production of il-8 that initiates inflammatory reactions to combat the bacterium. however, its persistent production causes tissue damage and interventions that suppress il-8 production prevent tissue damage. we hypothesised that probiotics could mediate their benefits via inhibition of il-8 synthesis. caco-2 cells were infected with probiotic bifidobacterium infantis w52, lactobacillus casei w56, lactococcus lactis w58, lactobacillus acidophilus w70, bifidobacterium bifidum w23, or lactobacillus salivarius w24 or pathogenic salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis 857 at 0, 0.2, 1, 2, 10, 20, 100 or 200 bacterial cells/caco-2 cell for 1 hour. cells were also exposed to a combination of one probiotic bacterium (200 bacterial cells/caco-2 cell) and the graded numbers of salmonella as either  co-incubation (1 hour) or pre-incubation of the probiotic bacterium (1 hour) followed by salmonella (1 hour). the cells recovered for 2 or 24 hours. il-8 and  hsp70 were determined by elisa and western blot respectively. both probiotics and salmonella induced a dose- and time-dependent synthesis of il-8 but probiotics induced far lower il-8 levels than salmonella. the salmonella-induced il-8 was significantly suppressed by b. infantis w52, l. casei w56 and l. lactis w58 at low numbers of salmonella (0.2 to 20 bacterial cells/caco-2 cell) and within 2 hours of recovery. the observed probiotic-mediated reduction in il-8 secretion was transient, and lost after a few hours. in addition, these three probiotics induced a significant increase in hsp70 expression while l. acidophilus w70, b. bifidum w23 and l. salivarius w24 induced a weak hsp70 expression and could not suppress the salmonella-induced il-8 synthesis. we conclude that suppression of salmonella-induced il-8 synthesis by caco-2 cells is exhibited by probiotics that induce expression of hsp70, suggesting that the protective role of probiotics could be mediated, at least in part, via hsp70 expression. this suppression is limited to a low number of infecting pathogenic salmonella.

TI  == enhancing the biotransformation of isoflavones in soymilk supplemented with lactose using probiotic bacteria during extended fermentation.
AB  == soymilk (sm) lacks lactose; hence supplementation of sm with lactose is likely to enhance the growth of probiotic bacteria and biotransformation of isoflavone glycosides to isoflavone aglycones. in this study, 11 strains of probiotic bacteria including lactobacillus rhamnosus, l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, howaru l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium lactis type bi-07, b. longum, howaru b. bifidum, and b lactis type bi-04 were inoculated individually or as mixed cultures into sm and soymilk  supplemented with lactose (sml). a total of 2% of lactose was added to 1 l of sm  with the aim of improving the growth of probiotic organisms and promoting the biotransformation of isoflavone isomers to bioactive isoflavone aglycomes. samples of sm were incubated at 37 degrees c and 10 ml aliquots of sm were taken  at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h to monitor the growth of probiotic bacteria and changes in isoflavone contents using high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). results  indicated that sml fermented with probiotics had higher viable counts by >2.4 log cfu/ml than that in sm at the end of the 72 h fermentation period. mixed cultures grew at different rates and in general lactobacilius spp. had >1.02 log cfu/ml more cells than bifidobacterium spp. at the end of the fermentation period. the total aglycone content in sm at 72 h of fermentation was 0.924 mg/100 ml, whereas that in sml was 1.623 mg/100 ml. addition of lactose not only improved the growth of probiotic bacteria in sm but also enhanced the biotransformation of isoflavone glucosides to the more bioactive isoflavone aglycones. mixed cultures did not improve the biotransformation of bioactive isoflavones when compared to single cultures.

TI  == effect of probiotics on symptoms in korean adults with irritable bowel syndrome.
AB  == background/aims: irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a troublesome disease. some strains of probiotics reportedly exert remarkable immunomodulatory effects, and so we designed a prospective double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical  study to assess their effects in korean adults with ibs. methods: ibs patients who met rome iii criteria were randomly assigned to receive composite probiotics  or placebo. a total of 20 billion lyophilized bacteria were administered twice daily for 8 weeks. primary outcome variables were symptom scores consisting of abdominal pain, flatulence, defecation discomfort, and sum of symptom scores. a visual analogue scale was used to quantify the severity. secondary outcome variables consisted of the quality of life and bowel habits including defecation  frequency and stool form. results: thirty-six and 34 patients were randomized to  the probiotics and placebo groups, respectively. intention-to-treat analysis showed significant reductions in pain after 8 weeks of treatment: -31.9 and -17.7 in the probiotics and placebo groups, respectively (p=0.045). the reductions in abdominal pain, defecation discomfort, and sum of scores were more significant in 58 patients with a score of at least 3 on the baseline stool-form scale. conclusions: composite probiotics containing bifidobacterium bifidum bgn4, lactobacillus acidophilus ad031, and other species are safe and effective, especially in patients who excrete normal or loose stools.

TI  == the effect of nonylphenol on the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum.
AB  == background and purpose: nonylphenol (np) is a well-known environmental hormone recognized as detrimental to the reproductive systems of aquatic animals and humans. the effect of np on probiotics in the human gastrointestinal tract remains unclear. this study investigated the effect of np on the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum. methods: l. acidophilus and b. bifidum were grown in anaerobic cultures. both strains were incubated with and without np. the dose effects of np on the growth of both probiotics were compared, and the effects of np on the growth of l. acidophilus and b. bifidum in different concentrations were evaluated. results: np 5 to 10 microg/ml inhibited  the growth of l. acidophilus (p < 0.05), but was ineffective at 2.5 microg/ml (p  > 0.05). np significantly inhibited the growth of b. bifidum in a dose-dependent  manner (p < 0.05). np inhibited the growth of different concentrations of l. acidophilus (6.25 x 10(4); to 2.5 x 10(5); colony-forming units [cfu]/ml) and b.  bifidum (1.25 x 10(9); to 5.0 x 10(9); cfu/ml) [p < 0.05]. conclusions: growth of l. acidophilus and b. bifidum was inhibited by np. this finding suggests that np  may interfere with normal gastrointestinal microbiota. this may alter immunomodulation in the intestinal mucosa and may be correlated with an increase  in the incidence of allergic diseases or other gastrointestinal disorders.

TI  == effect of probiotic mix (bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus) in the primary prevention of eczema: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == controversy exists regarding the preventive effect of probiotics on the development of eczema or atopic dermatitis. we investigated whether supplementation of probiotics prevents the development of eczema in infants at high risk. in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 112 pregnant  women with a family history of allergic diseases received a once-daily supplement, either a mixture of bifidobacterium bifidum bgn4, b. lactis ad011, and lactobacillus acidophilus ad031, or placebo, starting at 4-8 wks before delivery and continuing until 6 months after delivery. infants were exclusively breast-fed during the first 3 months, and were subsequently fed with breastmilk or cow's milk formula from 4 to 6 months of age. clinical symptoms of the infants were monitored until 1 yr of age, when the total and specific ige against common  food allergens were measured. a total of 68 infants completed the study. the prevalence of eczema at 1 yr in the probiotic group was significantly lower than  in the placebo group (18.2% vs. 40.0%, p=0.048). the cumulative incidence of eczema during the first 12 months was reduced significantly in probiotic group (36.4% vs. 62.9%, p=0.029); however, there was no difference in serum total ige level or the sensitization against food allergens between the two groups. prenatal and postnatal supplementation with a mixture of b. bifidum bgn4, b. lactis ad011, and l. acidophilus ad031 is an effective approach in preventing the development of eczema in infants at high risk of allergy during the first year of life.

TI  == growth-inhibiting activities of phenethyl isothiocyanate and its derivatives against intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibiting activities of sinapis alba l. seed-derived materials were examined on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, b. breve, b. longum, clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, escherichia coli, lactobacillus acidophilus, and l. casei. the active component of s. alba seeds was purified using silica gel column chromatography and hplc and was identified as phenethyl isothiocyanate by various spectroscopic analyses. the antimicrobial activity of phenethyl isothiocyanate varied according to the dose and bacterial strain tested. phenethyl isothiocyanate strongly inhibited the growth of c. difficile and c. perfringens at 1 mg/disc, and weakly (+) inhibited its growth at 0.1 mg/disc. furthermore, phenethyl isothiocyanate moderately (++) inhibited the growth of e. coli at a dose of 2 mg/disc, but did not inhibit the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. addition of various functional groups to isothiocyanates resulted in selective inhibitory activity against harmful bacteria with low concentrations of aromatic isothiocyanates demonstrating greater inhibitory activity against clostridia and e. coli than aliphatic isothiocyanates. in conclusion, aromatic isothiocyanates containing phenethyl-, benzyl-, and benzoyl-groups might be useful in the development of novel preventive and therapeutic agents against diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.

AB  == the growth capacity of probiotic lactobacillus paracasei a13, bifidobacterium bifidum a1 and l. acidophilus a3 in a probiotic fresh cheese commercialized in argentina since 1999 was studied during its manufacture and refrigerated storage  at 5 degrees c and 12 degrees c for 60 days. additionally, viable cell counts for probiotic bacteria in the commercial product are reported for batch productions over the last 9 years. l. paracasei a13 grew a half log order at 43 degrees c during the manufacturing process of probiotic cheese and another half log order during the first 15 days of storage at 5 degrees c, without negative effects on sensorial properties of the product. however, a negative impact on sensorial characteristics was observed when cheeses were stored at 12 degrees c for 60 days. colony counts in the commercial product showed variations from batch to batch over the last 9 years. however, colony counts for each probiotic bacterium  were always above the minimum suggested. growth capacity of l. paracasei a13 in cheese during manufacturing and storage, mainly at temperatures commonly found in retail display cabinets in supermarkets (12 degrees c or more), would make it necessary to re-evaluate its role as possible probiotic starter and the consequences on food sensorial characteristics if storage temperature during commercial shelf life is not tightly controlled.

TI  == antigen-presenting cells exposed to lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, bifidobacterium bifidum bi-98, and bi-504 reduce regulatory t cell activity.
AB  == background: the effect in vitro of six different probiotic strains including lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, lactobacillus salivarius ls-33, lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei ys8866441, lactobacillus plantarum lp-115, bifidobacterium bifidum bi-504 and bi-98 was studied on splenic enteroantigen-presenting cells (apc) and cd4(+)cd25(+) t-regulatory cells (tregs) in splenocyte-t cell proliferation assays. methods: splenocytes exposed to enteroantigen +/- probiotics were used to stimulate cultured cd4(+)cd25(-) t cells to which titrated numbers of tregs were added. cytokine assays were performed by use of neutralizing antibodies and elisa. results: exposure of apcs  to enteroantigens and the series of probiotic strains mentioned above did not influence the stimulatory capacity of apcs on proliferative enteroantigen-specific t cells. however, exposure to b. bifidum bi-98, bi-504 and l. acidophilus ncfm consistently reduced the suppressive activity of tregs. the suppressive activity was analyzed using fractionated components of the probiotics, and showed that a component of the cell wall is responsible for the decreased treg activity in the system. the probiotic-induced suppression of treg  function is not mediated by changes in apc-secretion of the inflammatory cytokines il-6 or il-1b. conclusion: we conclude that certain probiotic strains can modify apcs to cause reduced treg activity. this effect apparently depends on a direct apc-to-treg cell contact. the apc-mediated suppressive effect on treg function of certain probiotic strains may constrain the anti-inflammatory activity, which is often desired from probiotic therapy. this unexpected function of certain probiotic strains should be taken into consideration when designing adjuvant therapies with these bacteria, or when probiotic strains are selected for improvement of gut-associated inflammation like ibd.

TI  == probiotic use in the critically ill.
AB  == probiotics are "live microbes which when administered in adequate amounts confer  a health benefit to the host" (fao/who joint group). their potential role in bio-ecological modification of pathological internal milieu of the critically ill is under evaluation. probiotics are available as single microbial strain (e.g., bacillus clausii, lactobacillus) or as a mix of multiple strains of lactobacillus (acidophilus, sporogenes, lactis, reuteri rc-14, gg, and l. plantarum 299v), bifidobacterium (bifidum, longum, infantis), streptococcus (thermophillus, lactis, fecalis), saccharomyces boulardii etc. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are gram-positive, anaerobic, lactic acid bacteria. these are normal inhabitant of human gut and colonize the colon better than others. critical illness and its  treatment create hostile environment in the gut and alters the micro flora favoring growth of pathogens. therapy with probiotics is an effort to reduce or eliminate potential pathogens and toxins, to release nutrients, antioxidants, growth factors and coagulation factors, to stimulate gut motility and to modulate innate and adaptive immune defense mechanisms via the normalization of altered gut flora. scientific evidence shows that use of probiotics is effective in prevention and therapy of antibiotic associated diarrhea. however, available probiotics strains in currently used doses do not provide much needed early benefits, and need long-term administration to have clinically beneficial effects (viz, a reduction in rate of infection, severe sepsis, icu stay, ventilation days and mortality) in critically ill surgical and trauma patients. possibly, available strains do not adhere to intestinal mucosa early, or may require higher dose than what is used. gap exists in our knowledge regarding mechanisms of action of different probiotics, most effective strains--single or multiple, cost  effectiveness, risk-benefit potential, optimum dose, frequency and duration of treatment etc. more information is needed on safety profile of probiotics in immunocompromised state of the critically ill in view of rare reports of fungemia and sepsis and a trend toward possible increase in nosocomial infection. at present, despite theoretical potential benefits, available evidence is not conclusive to recommend probiotics for routine use in the critically ill.

AB  == a study was conducted to determine whether direct-fed microbials (dfm) could be used to increase digestibility and minimize the risk of acidosis associated with  feeding an increase in the amount of starch fed to horses. fifteen mature thoroughbred geldings were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments in a 3 x 3 latin square design balanced for carryover effects. within each 26-d period, horses were offered grass hay + low-starch concentrate (ls; 1.2 g of starch x kg  of bw(-1) x meal(-1)) from d 1 to 13 and then were abruptly changed to hay + high-starch concentrate (hs; 2.4 g of starch.kg of bw(-1)x meal(-1)) on d 14 continuing through d 26. the dfm treatments were offered in concentrate pellets at a target dosage of 10(8) cfu/(50 kg of bw x d) as follows: no dfm (con; control), lactobacillus acidophilus (lac1; single-species dfm), or a mixture of l. acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium bifidum, and enterococcus faecium (lac4; multiple-species dfm). total feces were collected over 72 h from d 11 to 13 (ls; low dietary starch collection), from d 15 to 17 (ac; abrupt change  in dietary starch collection), and at the end of each experimental period, from d 24 to 26 (hs; high dietary starch collection). data collected consisted of total  dm intake and fecal output, fecal ph, fecal acetate and propionate concentrations, and viable numbers of dfm in the feed. with the exception of fe digestibility, there were no starch x dfm interactions. there was an effect of starch level (p <or= 0.02) on most nutrient digestibilities, except for mg (p = 0.08) and cp, k, and zn (p > 0.10). horses supplemented with lac4 had increased ether extract (p < 0.05) and a tendency for decreased na (p < 0.10) digestibilities compared with con horses. all dfm-supplemented horses had increased cu (p < 0.05) and fe and numerically increased zn digestibilities compared with con horses. fecal ph decreased (p < 0.05), and fecal propionate concentration increased (p < 0.05) as dietary starch content changed from ls to hs. there was a tendency for elevated fecal ph (p < 0.10) in lac1 horses compared with con horses. these results confirm that increasing starch in the equine diet  can enhance nutrient digestibility of the diet. supplementing equine diets with either a single or mixed strain direct-fed lactic acid bacteria had limited effects on nutrient digestibility or on reducing the risk of acidosis associated  with feeding high-starch concentrates to horses. the potential response of dfm supplementation should be evaluated when a more acute acidotic state is induced in horses than in the current study.

TI  == rapid identification of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium in probiotic products using multiplex pcr.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are beneficial for the gastrointestinal tract and reinforce immunity in human health. recently, many functional products using the  lactic acid bacteria have been developed. among these lab, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium bifidum are frequently used for probiotic products. in order to monitor these lab in commercial probiotic products, a multiplex pcr method was developed. we designed four species-specific primer pairs for multiplex pcr from the 16s rrna,  16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region, and 23s rrna genes in lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium bifidum. using these primer pairs, 4 different lab were detected with high specificity in functional foods. we suggest that the multiplex pcr method developed in this study would be an efficient tool for simple, rapid, and reliable identification of lab used as probiotic strains.

TI  == design of a multispecies probiotic mixture to prevent infectious complications in critically ill patients.
AB  == background & aims: although the potential for probiotics is investigated in an increasing variety of diseases, there is little or no consensus regarding the desired probiotic properties for a particular disease in question, nor about the  final design of the probiotic. specific strain selection procedures were undertaken to design a disease-specific multispecies probiotic. methods: from a strain collection of 69 different lactic acid bacteria a primary selection was made of 14 strains belonging to different species showing superior survival in a  simulated gastrointestinal environment. functional tests like antimicrobial activity against a range of clinical isolates and cytokine inducing capacity in cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used to further identify potential strains. results: specific strains inhibited growth of clinical isolates whereas others superiorly induced the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10.  based on functional tests and general criteria regarding probiotic design and safety, a selection of the following six strains was made (ecologic 641); bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus salivarius and lactococcus lactis. combination of these strains resulted in a wider antimicrobial spectrum, superior induction of il-10 and silencing of pro-inflammatory cytokines as compared to the individual components. conclusions: application of strict criteria during the design of a disease-specific probiotic prior to implementation in clinical trials may provide a rational basis for use of probiotics.

TI  == basic characteristics of sporolactobacillus inulinus bcrc 14647 for potential probiotic properties.
AB  == the basic characteristics of the spore-forming lactic acid bacterium, sporolactobacillus inulinus bcrc 14647, was evaluated in vitro for its potential  probiotic properties. assessments including acid and bile salt tolerance, adhesiveness, and antagonistic effects on pathogenic salmonella enteritidis bcrc  10744, as well as inhibition factors of spent culture supernatant (scs) and an invasion assay, were conducted using lactobacillus acidophilus bcrc 10695 and two bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium bifidum bcrc 14615 and b. longum bcrc 11847) as a reference. in the results, s. inulinus spores presented significantly higher survival rates than the vegetative cell form in acidic conditions as well as the  reference bifidobacteria. however, l. acidophilus showed the highest viability among all tested strains. similar results were found in the bile tolerance test.  compared with the reference strains, the vegetative cell form of s. inulinus possessed a proper adhesive characteristic (71.7 bacteria/field for s. inulinus and 91.3 and 45.7 bacteria/field for b. bifidum and b. longum, respectively). in  the adhesion assay, both the spore form of s. inulinus (17.1 bacteria/field) and  the negative control, l. bulgaricus bcrc 14009 (5.9 bacteria/field), displayed nonadhesive traits. the vegetative cells of s. inulinus and its scs both dramatically decrease the adhesion of s. enteritidis to caco-2 cells; meanwhile,  the scs of s. inulinus vegetative cells inhibited the growth of s. enteritidis in the inhibition zone test. the existing inhibition factor could be assumed to be lactic acid in the scs. from the results of the invasion assay, s. inulinus showed high safety properties. in conclusion, based on these in vitro evaluations, results suggest that s. inulinus presents probiotic features of great potential in the vegetative cell form.

TI  == meta-analysis of probiotics for the prevention of traveler's diarrhea.
AB  == background: traveler's diarrhea (td) is a common health complaint among travelers. rates of td can range from 5% to 50%, depending on the destination. the use of probiotics for this disease remains controversial. the objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of probiotics for the prevention of td based on published randomized, controlled clinical trials. methods: pubmed, google scholar, metaregister, nih registry of clinical trials and cochrane central register of controlled trials were searched from 1977 to 2005, unrestricted by language. secondary searches of reference lists, authors, reviews, commentaries, associated diseases, books and meeting abstracts. inclusion criteria included: randomization, controlled, blinded, efficacy trials, in humans, peer-reviewed journals. exclusion criteria were: pre-clinical, safety, phase 1 studies in volunteers, reviews, duplicate reports, trials of unspecified  probiotics, trials of prebiotics, and inconsistent outcome measures. results: twelve of 940 screened studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. the pooled relative risk indicates that probiotics significantly prevent td (rr=0.85, 95% ci 0.79,0.91, p<0.001). conclusion: several probiotics (saccharomyces boulardii and a mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum) had significant efficacy. no serious adverse reactions were reported in the 12 trials. probiotics may offer a safe and effective method to prevent td.

TI  == combined effect of different lactic acid bacteria strains on the mode of cytokines pattern expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
AB  == the balance between immunogenic and tolerogenic activities in human immune system strongly depends on microflora-induced pro-and anti-inflammatory activities. lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important components of microflora. the interactions of the different strains of lab and the cells of immune system are largely unknown. to assess if lab strains composition would have an effect on the cellular responses profile (proliferation, cytokines synthesis) peripheral blood  mononuclear cells (pbmc) model system was used. pbmc were induced by three different strains of lab: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii spp. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium bifidum. tested strains were mixed together, in  combinations with each other (pairs) or alone. both, the lab mixture as well as the pairs and the single lab strains induced low lymphocyte proliferation (about  10% of cona-induced response). however, the single lab strains and their combinations were quite different cytokines inducers. first, l. acidophilus was much stronger ifn-gamma inducer than the lab mixture, being a few times higher il-12 stimulator than l. bulgaricus and b. bifidum. second, l. bulgaricus and b.  bifidum suppressed l.acidophilus-induced ifn-gamma synthesis to the level equal to that induced by the lab mixture, limiting il-12 production by about 30% and 70%, respectively. third, the lab strains were good il-10 and tnf-alpha inducers, irrespectively of their combinations used. we conclude that lab strains' pro or anti-inflammatory potentials are at least in part dependent on their composition. low lab mixture-induced il-12 and ifn-gamma production and relatively high il-10  and tnf-alpha expression may represent cellular activities normally induced in vivo by a combined action of bacterial antigens. their presence is important to limit pro-inflammatory reactions (via il-10) and to provide protection against infections (via tnf-alpha).

TI  == comparison of the concentrations of phenolic compounds in olive oils and other plant oils: correlation with antimicrobial activity.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of different edible vegetable oils was studied. in vitro results revealed that the oils from olive fruits had a strong bactericidal  action against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, this effect being higher in general against gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria. thus, olive oils showed bactericidal activity not only against harmful bacteria of the intestinal  microbiota (clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli) also against beneficial microorganisms such as lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum. otherwise, most of the foodborne pathogens tested (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica, yersinia sp., and shigella sonnei) did not survive after 1 h of contact with olive oils. the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl oleuropein and ligstroside aglycons, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol,  were the phenolic compounds that statistically correlated with bacterial survival. these findings were confirmed by testing each individual phenolic compound, isolated by hplc, against l. monocytogenes. in particular, the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl ligstroside aglycon showed a potent antimicrobial activity. these results indicate that not all oils classified as "olive oil" had similar bactericidal effects and that this bioactivity depended on their content of certain phenolic compounds.

TI  == modulation of antibody-mediated immune response by probiotics in chickens.
AB  == probiotic bacteria, including lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum, have been shown to enhance antibody responses in mammals. the objective  of this study was to examine the effects of a probiotic product containing the above bacteria in addition to streptococcus faecalis on the induction of the chicken antibody response to various antigens, both systemically and in the gut.  the birds received probiotics via oral gavage and subsequently were immunized with sheep red blood cells (srbc) and bovine serum albumin (bsa) to evaluate antibody responses in serum or with tetanus toxoid (tt) to measure the mucosal antibody response in gut contents. control groups received phosphate-buffered saline. overall, bsa and srbc induced a detectable antibody response as early as  week 1 postimmunization (p.i.), which lasted until week 3 p.i. probiotic-treated  birds had significantly (p <or= 0.001) more serum antibody (predominantly immunoglobulin m [igm]) to srbc than the birds that were not treated with probiotics. however, treatment with probiotics did not enhance the serum igm and  igg antibody responses to bsa. immunization with tt resulted in the presence of specific iga and igg antibody responses in the gut. again, treatment with probiotics did not change the level or duration of the antibody response in the gut. in conclusion, probiotics enhance the systemic antibody response to some antigens in chickens, but it remains to be seen whether probiotics have an effect on the generation of the mucosal antibody response.

TI  == effect of probiotic supplementation on bacterial translocation in thermal injury.
AB  == purpose: to examine the effects of probiotic supplementation and enteral solutions containing glutamine and arginine on bacterial translocation (bt) and intestinal villous atrophy in thermal injury. methods: forty male sprague-dawley  rats weighing 200-250 g were divided into four groups of ten. group 1 served as control group without thermal injury and was fed standard chow. thermal injury was inflicted as a 30% scald burn in the other three groups. group 2 was fed standard chow and group 3 was fed standard chow supplemented with a probiotic (acidophilus plus) containing bifidobacterium bifidum, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus bulgaricus (2 x 10(9) cfu/day) via an orogastric tube. group 4  was fed only an enteral diet (stresson multifiber) containing glutamine, arginine, and medium chain triglyceride, at 1 g/kg per day amino acid and 230 kcal/kg, for 7 days before thermal injury. all the animals were killed 24 h after thermal injury, and ileal segments were resected and examined histopathologically. to evaluate bt, samples from blood, mesenteric lymph nodes,  and cecal content were cultured under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. terminal  ileum specimens were histologically examined to evaluate mucosal integrity. results: significantly less bt was seen in groups 3 and 4 than in group 2 (p < 0.001). no significant difference was found between groups 3 and 4. histological  evaluation showed significant reduction in villous atrophy in groups 3 and 4. conclusion: probiotic supplementation seems to reduce bacterial translocation and decrease intestinal mucosal atrophy in rats with thermal injury, as do enteral solutions with arginine and glutamine.

TI  == effect of probiotics on preventing disruption of the intestinal microflora following antibiotic therapy: a double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study.
AB  == in this pilot-scale, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 30 patients with helicobacter pylori infection were randomised into three groups prior to their 7  days eradication therapy, to study the effects of probiotic supplement comprising lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum on the intestinal microflora in response to antibiotic therapy. group i received the placebo product from day 1 to day 15, group ii received placebo from day 1 to day 7 and probiotics from day 8 to day 15 and group iii received probiotics from day 1 to day 15. patients provided stool samples for analysis on days 1, 7, 12, 17 and 27. for patients in groups i and ii, significant increases in the facultative anaerobe component of the microflora occurred between days 1 and 7. in group i, the numbers remained elevated to day 27 but in group ii, the numbers decreased significantly between days 7 and 27 back to the starting levels. in group iii, the facultative anaerobe population remained stable throughout. the total anaerobe numbers increased significantly at day 27 than at day 1 for group i, were unchanged throughout for group ii and decreased significantly for the patients in group iii between days 1 and 7 before reverting to the starting levels by day 27. from these results, it can be seen that probiotic supplementation modulates the response of the intestinal microflora to the effects of antibiotic therapy.

AB  == the growth-inhibiting activity of anthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid and lapachol identified in the inner bark of taheebo, tabebuia impetiginosa, toward 10 human intestinal bacteria was evaluated by using a paper disk diffusion bioassay and compared to those of seven lapachol congeners (1,4-naphthoquinone, naphthazarin,  menadione, lawsone, plumbagin, juglone, and dichlone) as well as two commercially available antibiotics, chloramphenicol and tetracycline. anthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid exhibited very strong growth inhibition of clostridium paraputrificum at 1 microg/disk while 100 microg/disk of lapachol was needed for moderate growth inhibition of the same organism. these two isolates exhibited weak inhibition of clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli at 100  microg/disk while no adverse effects were observed on the growth of bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium infantis,  lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus casei at 1000 microg/disk. structure-activity relationships indicate that a methyl group in the c-2 position of 1,4-naphthoquinone derivatives might play an important role in antibacterial activity.

TI  == relationship between interaction sites in the gut, hydrophobicity, mucosal immunomodulating capacities and cell wall protein profiles in indigenous and exogenous bacteria.
AB  == aims: to investigate whether there is a relationship between interaction sites in the gut, hydrophobicity, mucosal immunomodulating capacities and cell wall protein profiles in lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and enterococci. methods and results: hydrophobicity, cell wall protein profiles and sites of interaction in the gut (by using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled bacteria) were determined for lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, b. animalis and enterococcus faecalis. we also determined the number of immunoglobulin (ig)a+, tumour necrosis factor (tnf)alpha+, interleukin (il)-6+ and il-10+ cells after oral administration of the above bacteria to balb/c mice.  all strains assessed were found to interact with the sites of induction of the immune response in the gut. no correlation with hydrophobicity was observed. when some strains at certain doses were administered to mice, bacterial translocation  to liver was observed. the oral administration of indigenous (104 cells day(-1))  and exogenous (107 cells day(-1)) bifidobacteria and lactobacilli for 5 consecutive days activated the systemic and intestinal mucosal immune response in a strain-specific way, independently whether the strain was indigenous or exogenous in relation to the host. the differences in the immunopotentiating capacity of the various strains might be related to the differences in their cell wall protein profiles. conclusions: indigenous bacteria activated the mucosal immune response at a dose significantly smaller than the one required for probiotic exogenous bacteria. however, probiotic exogenous bacteria can be used at high concentrations in fermented dairy products with a great impact on the immune system, favouring its immunomodulation. significance and impact of the study: the immunomodulation capacity of probiotic bacteria is strain specific and independent of the specificity of the host. the ability of certain strains to down-regulate the production and release of il-6 by il-10 may have potential implications in their use in cases in which cytokine deregulation or excessive production at the mucosal level can be the cause of tissue damage.

AB  == antigenotoxic activity against 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-nqo) of lactic acid bacteria isolated from commercial dairy products was studied using sos-chromotest. the supernatants from bacteria-genotoxin co-incubations in general exhibited a strong suppression on sos-induction produced by 4-nqo on the  tester organism escherichia coli pq37 (sfia::lacz). high genotoxicity inhibition  (>75%) was found for 31/67 of the examined bacteria and the maximum values of some strains within the species were as follows: lactobacillus casei, 99.1%; l. plantarum, 93.3%; l. rhamnosus, 93.4%; l. acidophilus, 90.9%; l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, 85.7% and bifidobacterium bifidum, 89.6%; strains with low antigenotoxicity (5-60%) were evidenced in both l. acidophilus and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, whereas some inactive strains were found only in l. casei and  l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. cell exposure to 100 degrees c for 15 min prevented antigenotoxicity and no effect was evidenced for cell-free spent media. the active strains survived at 0.1 mm 4-nqo exposure and generally presented some relevant functional properties, such as tolerance to bile (0.5%) or acid environment (ph 2.0) and adherence to caco-2 enterocytes. antigenotoxicity was always associated with modification of the 4-nqo absorbance profile.

TI  == evolution of carbohydrate fraction in carbonated fermented milks as affected by beta-galactosidase activity of starter strains.
AB  == the influence of carbonation on the evolution of lactose, galactose and glucose in fermented milks with added probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus acidophilus and/or bifidobacterium bifidum) was evaluated and related to beta-galactosidase activity of starter strains. during incubation and  first days of refrigeration, lactose hydrolysis resulting in the liberation of galactose and glucose occurred in ct (streptococcus thermophilus/lb. casei), at (str. thermophilus/lb. acidophilus) and abt fermented milks (str. thermophilus/lb. acidophilus/bifid. bifidum). levels of galactose were higher than those of glucose and could be related to the preferential consumption of glucose by actively growing bacteria. through the incubation, lactose and monosaccharide levels were not affected by milk carbonation. however, during refrigerated storage the presence of this gas was associated with slightly lower  content of lactose and higher levels of galactose and glucose in at and abt products but not in ct fermented milks. through the refrigeration galactose was moderately utilised by lb. acidophilus in at products whereas the presence of bifid. bifidum seems to prevent the consumption of this sugar in abt fermented milks. glucose remained constant, with minor variations in ct products but a continuous increase of this sugar occurred in carbonated at and abt fermented milks during storage. beta-galactosidase activity displayed by str. thermophilus  strains was similar at ph 6.5 (initial ph of non-carbonated samples) and ph 6.3 (initial ph of carbonated samples) whereas lb. acidophilus laa3 showed greater beta-galactosidase activity at ph 6.3 than at higher ph values. thus, the enhanced metabolic activity of lb. acidophilus caused by the low initial ph of carbonated milk also promoted higher cellular beta-galactosidase activity that could have released greater amounts of galactose and glucose from lactose in at and abt fermented milks through the refrigerated period. in ct fermented milks, similar beta-galactosidase activity levels of str. thermophilus at ph 6.5 and 6.3 together with the absence of beta-galactosidase activity in lb. casei could explain the lack of differences on glucose and galactose content between carbonated and non-carbonated samples.

TI  == selective responses of three ginkgo biloba leaf-derived constituents on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the selective responses of ginkgo biloba leaf-derived materials against six intestinal bacteria was examined using an impregnated paper disk method and compared with that of bilobalide, ginkgolides a and b, kaempferol, and quercetin. the components of g. biloba leaves were characterized as kaempferol 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside), kaempferol 3-o-(2' '-o-beta-d-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside, and quercetin 3-o-alpha-(6'  "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) by spectroscopic analysis. the growth  responses varied with each bacterial strain tested. at 2 mg/disk, kaempferol 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) and quercetin 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) revealed potent inhibition against clostridium perfringens, and kaempferol 3-o-(2' '-o-beta-d-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside showed a clear inhibitory effect on escherichia coli. at 0.5 mg/disk, quercetin 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) showed a strong activity against c. perfringens, but weak activity was exhibited by kaempferol 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) against c. perfringens and kaempferol  3-o-(2' '-o-beta-d-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside against e. coli. no inhibition was observed from treatments conducted with bilobalide, ginkgolides a  and b, kaempferol, or quercetin. furthermore, these isolated compounds did not inhibit bifidobacterium bifidum, b. longum, b. adolescentis, or lactobacillus acidophilus.

TI  == preventive effects of bifidobacterium- and lactobacillus-fermented milk on the development of inflammatory bowel disease in senescence-accelerated mouse p1/yit  strain mice.
AB  == background/aims: we recently discovered inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) in the ileum and cecum of samp1/yit strain mice under specific pathogen-free (spf) conditions. to determine the effect of lactic acid bacteria (lab - bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium bifidum and lactobacillus acidophilus)-fermented milk on the prevention of ibd in samp1/yit strain mice, we compared the disease severity on the intestinal inflammation among the group of mice fed saline, unfermented milk or lab-fermented milk. methods: three-week-old  samp1/yit strain mice (n = 72) were subdivided into three groups, that were fed saline, unfermented milk and lab-fermented milk, respectively. the diets were orally administered daily via a gastric tube. when the mice reached 20 weeks of age, they were sacrificed and the ibd scores were compared among the three groups. results: administration of the lab-fermented milk to samp1/yit strain mice reduced histological injury score, compared with those in saline-treated or  unfermented milk-treated samp1/yit strain mice. ileal tissue weight and myeloperoxidase activity also reduced by treatment of lab-fermented milk. moreover, the tissue contents of immunoglobulins such as igg1 and igg2a were lower in the inflammatory regions in the samp1/yit strain group fed lab-fermented milk than that fed saline and unfermented milk. cytokine-specific elisa assays indicated the production of t-helper 1 cytokines such as interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the culture supernatants of mln cells in the samp1/yit strain group fed lab-fermented milk was lower than those fed saline and unfermented milk. on the contrary, the production of interleukin-10 in mln cells  increased by prevention with lab-fermented milk. conclusion: lab-fermented milk is beneficial for the treatment of murine ibd and this effect may be modulated through stabilization of the mucosal immunity by lab.

TI  == selective growth inhibitor toward human intestinal bacteria derived from pulsatilla cernua root.
AB  == among 21 medicinal plants, the growth-inhibiting activity of pulsatilla cernua root-derived materials toward human intestinal bacteria was examined by using an  impregnated paper disk method. the biologically active components of p. cernua roots were characterized as 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid and 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid by spectroscopic analysis. the activity was compared with that of six commercially available cinnamic acid derivatives trans-cinnamaldehyde, trans-cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-methoxycinnamic acid, 3-methoxycinnamic acid, and 4-methoxycinnamic acid. the growth responses varied with each bacterial strain tested. two isolated compounds revealed a potent inhibition against clostridium perfringens, and moderate to weak activity  against escherichia coli was exhibited by 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid. weak  or no inhibitory activity was obtained against the bifidobacteria or lactobacillus acidophilus. the inhibitory effect was much more pronounced in c. perfringens and e. coli as compared to b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. fragilis,  b. longum, or l. acidophilus. cinnamaldehyde exhibited a strong growth-inhibiting activity, but no inhibition was observed from treatments with trans-cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-methoxycinnamic acid, 3-methoxycinnamic acid, and 4-methoxycinnamic acid. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of p. cernua root.

TI  == the synergistic effect of lactic acid bacteria and alkylglycerols on humoral immunity in mice.
AB  == investigations on immune suppression and reconstitution of immune functions dependent on the presence of physiological microflora allow us to conclude that symbiotic microorganisms such as lactobacillus sp. are essential for adequate activity of the defense system in humans. in addition to their beneficial influence on the intestinal microbial balance, these microorganisms exert a variety of immunomodulatory effects on the host immune system. on the other hand, immunostimulatory animal-derived substances rich in alkylglycerols have been shown to enhance lactic acid bacteria proliferation. therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects on murine humoral response of the combined administration of lyophilized combination of three lactic acid bacteria: l. acidophilus, l. bulgaricus and bifidobacterium bifidum together with alkylglycerol-rich shark liver oil. the lactic acid bacteria mixture induced markedly stronger enhancement of the humoral response than alkylglycerols did. a  significant synergistic stimulatory effect of lactic acid bacteria and alkylglycerols was observed in both treatment schedules: post- as well as in preimmunization with sheep red blood cells. however, their concomitant administration exerted stronger immunomodulatory effect than did the alternative  route of treatment.

TI  == thin layer chromatographic determination of organic acids for rapid identification of bifidobacteria at genus level.
AB  == this study presents a simple and fast method for the identification of bifidobacteria using a thin layer chromatographic (tlc) analysis of the short chain fatty acids in a culture broth. when the chromatogram was sprayed with the  indicator solution (methyl red-bromophenol blue in 70% ethanol), lactic acid exhibited two red spots, and acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid all produced blue spots. succinic acid and citric acid produced yellow and dark yellow spot, respectively. in addition, these organic acids showed different r(f) values. the total time taken to analyze the organic acids in the 10 bacterial culture broths using the proposed method was approximately 50 min. the proposed tlc method was used to analyze the organic acids in culture broths of the following strains, five bifidobacterium species. (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. bifidum, and b. adolescentis) and five other lactic acid bacteria strains (lactobacillus casei, l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus, and s. lactis). both spots of lactic acid and acetic  acid were detected on all the tlc plates from the five bifidobacterial culture broths. the five other lactic acid bacterial culture broths, however, only exhibited lactic acid spots. accordingly, the proposed tlc method would appear to be a useful tool for rapid identification of bifidobacterium spp. at the genus level.

TI  == influence of microbial species on small intestinal myoelectric activity and transit in germ-free rats.
AB  == the effect of an intestinal microflora consisting of selected microbial species on myoelectric activity of small intestine was studied using germ-free rat models, with recording before and after specific intestinal colonization, in the  unanesthetized state. intestinal transit, neuropeptides in blood (ria), and neuromessengers in the intestinal wall were determined. clostridium tabificum vp  04 promoted regular spike burst activity, shown by a reduction of the migrating myoelectric complex (mmc) period from 30.5 +/- 3.9 min in the germ-free state to  21.2 +/- 0.14 min (p < 0.01). lactobacillus acidophilus a10 and bifidobacterium bifidum b11 reduced the mmc period from 27.9 +/- 4.5 to 21.5 +/- 2.1 min (p < 0.02) and accelerated small intestinal transit (p < 0.05). micrococcus luteus showed an inhibitory effect, with an mmc period of 35.9 +/- 9.3 min compared with 27.7 +/- 6.3 min in germ-free rats (p < 0.01). inhibition was indicated also for  escherichia coli x7 gnotobiotic rats. no consistent changes in slow wave frequency were observed. the concentration of neuropeptide y in blood decreased after introduction of conventional intestinal microflora, suggesting reduced inhibitory control. intestinal bacteria promote or suppress the initiation and aboral migration of the mmc depending on the species involved. bacteria with primitive fermenting metabolism (anaerobes) emerge as important promoters of regular spike burst activity in small intestine.

(one strain), lactobacillus acidophilus (two strains), and lactobacillus casei (two strains) in different combinations, as probiotic adjuncts. probiotic, lactic starter (lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus), and contaminant (coliforms,  yeasts, and molds) organisms were counted at 0, 30, and 60 d of refrigerated storage. furthermore, the acid resistance of probiotic and starter bacteria was determined from hydrochloric solutions (ph 2 and 3) of fresco cheese. the results showed that nine different combinations of bifidobacteria and l. acidophilus had  a satisfactory viability (count decreases in 60 d <1 log order) in the cheese. both combinations of bifidobacteria and l. casei cultures assayed also showed a satisfactory survival (counts decreased <1 log order for bifidobacteria but no decrease was detected for l. casei). on the other hand, the three combinations of bifidobacteria, l. acidophilus, and l. casei tested adapted well to the fresco cheese environment. when a cheese homogenate at ph 3 was used to partially simulate the acidic conditions in the stomach, the probiotic cultures had an excellent ability to remain viable up to 3 h. at ph 2, the cell viability was more affected; b. bifidum was the most resistant organism. this study showed that the argentinian fresco cheese could be used as an adequate carrier of probiotic bacteria.

(lepidoptera: bombycidae) were examined using spectrophotometric and impregnated paper disk methods and compared to those of tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as those of coptis japonica root-derived berberine chloride. the biologically active constituent of the cultures was characterized as cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine) by spectroscopic analysis. this compound revealed potent growth-inhibiting activity toward clostridium paraputrificum and clostridium perfringens at 10 microgram/disk without adverse effects on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus casei, whereas tetracycline and chloramphenicol inhibited the growth of these lactic acid-producing bacteria, clostridia and escherichia coli. however, c. militaris-derived materials revealed no growth stimulation on the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of c. militaris. as a naturally occurring antibacterial agent, cordycepin could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by clostridia.

TI  == effects of probiotic bacteria on diarrhea, lipid metabolism, and carcinogenesis:  a review of papers published between 1988 and 1998.
AB  == we reviewed the evidence from human intervention studies for the health effects of probiotic bacteria, ie, live bacteria that survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract and have beneficial effects on the host. of the 49 studies reviewed, 26 dealt with the prevention or treatment of diarrheal disease, 9 with  the prevention of cancer or of the formation of carcinogens, 7 with the lowering  of serum cholesterol, and 7 with the stimulation of the immune system. the most widely studied probiotic bacteria were lactobacillus gg (22 studies), lactobacillus acidophilus (16 studies), bifidobacterium bifidum (6 studies), and  enterococcus faecium (7 studies). intake of lactobacillus gg consistently shortened the diarrheal phase of rotavirus infection by 1 d. however, evidence for the prevention by lactobacillus gg and other probiotics of diarrhea due to viral or bacterial infections was less strong. effects of probiotics on the immune system are inconclusive because of the variety of outcome variables reported. cholesterol lowering by l. acidophilus was shown in some but not all studies; cholesterol lowering by e. faecium seems to be transient. two studies of one research group showed a smaller recurrence of bladder tumors in patients after treatment with lactobacillus casei; these results await confirmation. the production of mutagens after a meal might be reduced by the concomitant intake of probiotics, but the relevance of this finding is unclear. in conclusion, consumption of foods containing lactobacillus gg may shorten the course of rotavirus infection. other health effects of probiotic bacteria have not been well established. well-designed placebo-controlled studies with validated outcome variables are needed to determine the health effects of probiotics.

AB  == lactic acid bacteria have been reported to have benefits for the prevention and treatment of some forms of diarrhea and related conditions. to determine whether  these effects might involve direct stimulation of the gastrointestinal immune response, we administered yogurt to try to enhance mucosal and systemic antibodies against an orally presented immunogen, cholera toxin. yogurts were manufactured with starter cultures containing different species and strains of lactic acid bacteria. mice were fed these yogurts for 3 wk, during which they were also orally immunized twice with 10 micrograms of cholera toxin. blood was collected on d 0 and 21, and fecal pellets were collected weekly. mice that were  immunized orally with cholera toxin responded by producing specific intestinal and serum immunoglobulin (ig)a anti-cholera toxin. antibody responses of the iga  isotype were significantly increased in mice fed yogurts made with starters containing the conventional yogurt bacteria lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus supplemented with lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium bifidum, and bifidobacterium infantis. yogurt that was manufactured with starters containing only conventional yogurt bacteria produced  less iga anti-cholera toxin than did the control group fed nonfat dry milk. although strong responses were also observed for igg anti-cholera toxin in serum, the responses did not differ among groups. thus, administration of yogurt supplemented with l. acidophilus and bifidobacterium spp. enhanced mucosal and systemic iga responses to the cholera toxin immunogen.

TI  == immune modulation of blood leukocytes in humans by lactic acid bacteria: criteria for strain selection.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria in food can transiently colonize the intestine and exert beneficial effects (probiotic). survival during intestinal transit or adhesion to epithelium or both seem to be important for modifying the host's immune reactivity. because lactobacillus acidophilus strain la1 is adherent to enterocytes in vitro, we hypothesize that contact with immune cells may occur in  vivo. however, bifidobacterium bifidum strain bb12, which shows high fecal colonization, is another potential immunomodulator. twenty-eight volunteers were  divided into two groups and given a fermented product containing one of the two strains. lymphocyte subsets and leukocyte phagocytic activity were studied in blood. no modifications were detected in lymphocyte subsets. in contrast, phagocytosis of escherichia coli ssp. was enhanced in both groups (p < 0.001 for  both). bacterial adhesion to enterocytes, fecal colonization, or both seem to be  valuable selection criteria for immunomodulation. antiinfective mechanisms of defense can be enhanced after ingestion of specific lactic acid bacteria strains.

AB  == this study was conducted to validate a dynamic model of the stomach and small intestine to quantify the survival of lactic acid bacteria and to assess the influence of gastrointestinal secretions. the survival of a single strain of each of the following species, bifidobacterium bifidum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus, was measured under physiological conditions (e.g., peristalsis, changes in ph, and changes in concentrations of enzymes and bile) and were compared with data obtained from humans. no significant differences were found between the in vitro and in vivo data, indicating that the model has a predictive value for the survival of these  bacteria in humans. the survival of these strains of lactic acid bacteria in the  gastrointestinal model was investigated under two different conditions in the small intestine: simulation of physiological secretion of bile and low bile secretion. reductions in viability were significantly different between the bacterial species. the dose-response effect of bile on the survival of the tested bacteria was significant, demonstrating the bactericidal effect of bile salts. this study demonstrates the differences among bacterial species in their sensitivity to gastric and intestinal secretions.

AB  == objective: to study the effect of administration of clindamycin with or without supplementation of the intestinal microflora with bifidobacterium bifidum and lactobacillus acidophilus. methods: twenty-three healthy subjects received clindamycin by mouth for 7 days. eleven of the subjects also received capsules containing lyophilized l. acidophilus and b. bifidum for 14 days. the other 12 subjects received placebo. results: there was a marked decrease in total numbers  of anaerobic bacteria during the administration of clindamycin. in the lactic acid bacteria-supplemented group, a tendency towards delayed reduction and earlier increase in bifidobacteria was observed, and two of 11 subjects (18%) were colonized with clostridium difficile, in comparison with five of 12 (41%) in the placebo group. the total number of microorganisms was significantly higher in the lactic acid bacteria-supplemented group than in the placebo group (p=0.02) 4  days after the end of clindamycin administration. the difference was mainly due to higher counts of escherichia coli and enterococci. mean levels of other enterobacteria increased less in the lactic acid bacteria-supplemented group than in the placebo group between days 0 and 14. conclusions: the recolonization with  aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms was faster in the lactic acid bacteria-supplemented group than in the placebo group. this may be of importance  in preventing colonization with c. difficile.

AB  == previous studies in our laboratory suggested that lactobacillus acidophilus strain dds-1 (la1) has a suppressive effect on chemically induced tumors in experimental animals. in an effort to understand the possible mechanisms underlying this effect, we investigated the ability of la1 to induce the production of interleukin-1 alpha (il-1 alpha) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), which have potent cytocidal and cytostatic effects on tumor cells. the mouse macrophage cell line raw264.7 was incubated with live or heat-killed cells of four strains of l. acidophilus or bifidobacterium bifidum. escherichia coli was used as a source of lipopolysaccharide that is known to induce the above cytokines. the amount of the cytokines present in the culture fluid was quantitated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. la1 induced the production of higher levels of il-1 alpha and tnf-alpha than other lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. stimulation of the production of the cytokines was not due to the lipopolysaccharide (lps) component, since lps at concentrations equivalent to, or 100-fold greater than, that of la1 induced only negligible amounts of il-1 alpha  and tnf-alpha. these results reveal that non-lps component(s) of la1 stimulate(s) the production of il-1 alpha and tnf-alpha by macrophages, indicating that this organism stimulates the production of immunologic factors.

TI  == antiproliferative effect of fermented milk on the growth of a human breast cancer cell line.
AB  == in vivo and in vitro studies have shown an antitumor activity of lactobacilli in  colon cancer, and some epidemiologic studies have indicated a reduced risk of breast cancer in women who consume fermented milk products. we studied the direct effect of milk fermented by five bacteria strains (bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium animalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus paracasei) on the growth of the mcf7 breast cancer cell line. our results showed a growth inhibition induced by all fermented milks, even though b. infantis and l. acidophilus were the most effective (85% inhibition after 9 days). the antiproliferative effect was not related to the presence of bacteria in fermented milk, and neither whole milk (crude or ultrahigh temperature sterlizied) nor its main fractions (lactalbumin or beta-lactoglobulin fraction) affected cell growth. our findings suggest the presence of an ex novo soluble compound produced by lactic acid bacteria during milk fermentation or the microbial transformation of some milk components in a biologically active form. although the mechanism of the antitumor activity is not clear, the present study  suggests the potentiality offered by fermented milk as producers of compounds with antiproliferative activity useful in the prevention and therapy of solid tumors like breast cancer.

TI  == biotherapeutic agents. a neglected modality for the treatment and prevention of selected intestinal and vaginal infections.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the potential of biotherapeutic agents (microorganisms with therapeutic properties) for the prevention and/or treatment of selected intestinal and vaginal infections. data sources: the medline database was searched for all relevant articles published between 1966 and september 1995. search terms used were biotherapeutic agent, probiotic, lactobacillus, saccharomyces, bifidobacterium, candida, gastrointestinal- system, vaginitis, vaginosis-bacterial, and related terms. the bibliographies of obtained articles were also reviewed. study selection and data extraction: all placebo-controlled human studies on biotherapeutic agents were reviewed. english-language open trials, case series and reports, and animal studies were reviewed only if they were especially relevant to providing information on the potential efficacy, adverse effects, or mechanisms of action of these agents. data synthesis: placebo-controlled studies have shown that biotherapeutic agents have been used successfully to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea (lactobacillus caseigg, bifidobacterium longum, b longum with l acidophilus, and saccharomyces boulardii), to prevent acute infantile diarrhea (bifidobacterium bifidum with streptococcus thermophilus), to treat recurrent clostridium difficile disease (s  boulardii), and to treat various other diarrheal illnesses (enterococcus faecium  sf68, l caseigg, and s boulardii). there is also evidence for lactobacillus acidophilus in the prevention of candidal vaginitis. few adverse effects have been reported. however, many of the studies tested only small numbers of patients or volunteers. conclusions: there is now evidence that administration of selected microorganisms is beneficial in the prevention and treatment of certain intestinal and, possibly, treatment of vaginal infections. in an effort to decrease the reliance on antimicrobials, the time has come to carefully explore the therapeutic applications of biotherapeutic agents.

TI  == [the efficacy of the eubiotic bifacide when used in the combined antibacterial therapy of newborn infants with infectious-inflammatory diseases].
AB  == the efficacies of bifacid and bifidumbacterin were studied comparatively in the correction of intestinal biocenosis in 60 newborns with infectious inflammatory diseases and intestine disfunction treated with massive doses of antibacterial drugs. the study showed that the use of bifidumbacterin was accompanied by significant disturbances in the biocenosis and by development of the intestinal syndrome. the protective action of the drug was observed after a short-term use only of one antibiotic and when the course of the bifidum therapy was continued after discontinuation of the treatment with antibacterial drugs. the use of bifacid was accompanied by a rapid (by the 2nd or the 5th day fo the treatment) and stable normalization of the stools and a marked improvement of the patient general state. the clinical efficacy of bifacid was much higher than that of bifidumbacterin. at the background of the bifacid therapy there was observed correction of the intestinal microflora composition due to normalization of the count of bifidobacterium, lactobacillus and colibacillus as well as to eradication of opportunistic pathogens.

TI  == inability of lactobacillus casei strain gg, l. acidophilus, and bifidobacterium bifidum to degrade intestinal mucus glycoproteins.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria have been suggested for use in the prevention of relapse of ulcerative colitis and of recurrent pouchitis. these strains may not damage the protective intestinal mucus glycoproteins. methods: lactobacillus casei strain gg and strains isolated from a commercial fermented product (lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium bifidum, and a mesophylic lactic culture) were cultured in vitro on hog gastric mucin and human intestinal glycoproteins. furthermore, germ-free rats were mono-associated with lactobacillus gg and poly-associated with the other strains. glycoproteins were isolated from rat distal ileum, cecum, and colon. mucus degradation was established by assaying carbohydrates (hexosamines, hexoses, pentoses), proteins, and blood group antigenicity. results: all strains colonized the intestinal mucus but were not found in the deep crypts. degradation of mucus glycoproteins was observed neither in vitro nor in vivo. conclusion: the tested strains do not break down intestinal mucus glycoproteins and thus far are safe to use for therapy.

TI  == immunomodulation of human blood cells following the ingestion of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == because of the lack of data that convincingly show immunomodulatory properties of lactic acid bacteria in humans, a study was performed in which healthy volunteers were divided into two groups and given a fermented milk product supplemented with lactobacillus acidophilus strain la1 or bifidobacterium bifidum strain bb 12 for  3 wk. blood was sampled throughout the study to assess changes in lymphocyte subsets or leukocyte phagocytic activity following consumption of the fermented products. no modifications of lymphocyte subpopulations were detected. in contrast, phagocytosis of escherichia coli sp. in vitro was enhanced after the administration of both fermented products. the increment in phagocytosis was coincident with fecal colonization by the lactic acid bacteria and persisted for  6 wk after ingestion of the fermented products. by this time, the fecal lactobacilli and bifidobacteria had returned to concentrations prior to consumption. nonspecific, anti-infective mechanisms of defense can be enhanced by the ingestion of specific lactic acid bacteria strains. these strains can be used as nutritional supplements to improve the immune function of particular age groups, i.e., the neonate or the elderly, for which these functions are diminished.

TI  == absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium.
AB  == to investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum, lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. the production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by hplc analysis in growing cultures. resting whole cells from a positive control strain, eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of  .2 mm cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at ph 7.3. however, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. in growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by e. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. none of the test strains showed production of either  deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.

AB  == a double-blind placebo controlled investigation was carried out to study the effect of peroral colonization. human volunteers were given mixtures of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria. measurements were made over a 1 week treatment period and for another week after the end of the treatment. two different bacteriological preparations were used, one consisted of enterococcus faecium and bifidobacterium longum (a total of 6.4 x 10(8) cfu d-1); the other consisted of lactobacillus acidophilus, bif. bifidum, lact. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus (a total of 9 x 10(9) cfu d-1). together with a placebo preparation, they were given to 24 healthy controls (eight in each group). microbiological examinations of jejunal aspirates showed that viable counts of most species were below the detection limit. however, the test preparation containing ent. faecium and bif. longum significantly reduced the anaerobe: aerobe ratio in faeces by a factor of three during treatment (p = 0.03), and increased it by a factor of 30 during the following week (p < 0.02). this study shows that peroral administration of certain bacterial cultures may affect the distal intestinal microflora.

TI  == effect of lactic acid bacteria on the intestinal production of lactate and short-chain fatty acids, and the absorption of lactose.
AB  == the characteristic fermentation pattern seen with specific saccharides in incubations with pure cultures of lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum disappeared when incubated in 16.7% fecal homogenate. the productions of  lactate and short-chain fatty acids in mixed bacterial-fecal incubations were similar to productions in fecal homogenates without l acidophilus and b bifidum and were mainly associated with the specific mono-, di-, and polysaccharides added to the incubate. b bifidum was cultured from ileostomic contents in eight of nine ileostomists after oral administration (2.4 x 10(10) cells), but did not  influence the concentrations and productions of dl-lactate and short-chain fatty  acids in the ileostomic outputs and incubates. large amounts of ingested lactic acid bacteria (4.2 x 10(10) cells) did not ameliorate lactose malabsorption measured by the breath-hydrogen test in 12 lactose malabsorbers. this study shows that ingested lactic acid bacteria are indeed present in the colon, but it does not support the theory that they change the pattern of colonic fermentation or the degree of intestinal lactose malabsorption.

TI  == microbial purification technique of mineral dressing plants reject waters.
AB  == earlier investigations on laboratory and pilot plant scale have shown the resort  to microorganisms to be a practicable approach to the problem of purifying mineral dressing plant reject waters from residual flotation reagents and/or metal ions. in spite of the proven effectiveness of this method, one major drawback, namely the pathogenicity of some microorganisms, has so far hampered its application on a commercial scale. a research programme, aimed at developing  a microbial reject water purification technique utilizing non-pathogenic strains  was thus drawn up and is currently being implemented. strains such as bacillus subtilis, saccharomyces cerevisiae, bifidobacterium bifidum, lactobacillus acidophilus and acinetobacter calcoaceticus, which are not harmful to human health, some of them being commonly found in the human intestine, have been successfully tested for removing alkylsulphates, alkylamines and fatty acids from solutions simulating flotation plant tailings waters. removals as high as 90% in  less than 48 h can be easily achieved with no nutrient requirements, since in most cases the flotation reagent residue to be removed is metabolized by the microorganisms themselves.

TI  == the assumed assimilation of cholesterol by lactobacilli and bifidobacterium bifidum is due to their bile salt-deconjugating activity.
AB  == to study the mechanism of the propsed assimilation of cholesterol, we cultured various strains of lactobacillus acidophilus and a bifidobacterium sp. in the presence of cholesterol and oxgall. during culturing, both cholesterol and bile salts were precipitated. because of bacterial bile salt deconjugation, no conjugated bile salts were observed in either the culture fluids or the pellets.  during incubation, the cell count and optical density decreased. the degree of precipitation of bile salts and of cholesterol was dependent on the culture conditions. if l. acidophilus rp32 was cultured under acidifying conditions, the  degree of precipitation of deconjugated bile salts was higher than if the ph was  maintained at 6.0. under acidifying conditions, cholesterol was coprecipitated with the bile salts, whereas in ph-controlled cultures, no coprecipitation of cholesterol was observed. from control experiments with different mixtures of bile salts, it appeared that coprecipitation of cholesterol during culturing was  a result of formation of deconjugated bile salts, which have a decreased solubility at ph values lower than 6.0. it is concluded that the removal of cholesterol from the culture medium by l. acidophilus rp32 and other species is not due to bacterial uptake of cholesterol, but results from bacterial bile salt-deconjugating activity.
