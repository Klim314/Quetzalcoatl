TI  == effects of baseplates of orthodontic appliances with in situ generated silver nanoparticles on cariogenic bacteria: a randomized, double-blind cross-over clinical trial.
AB  == aim: polymethyl-methacrylate (pmma) is commonly used primarily for baseplates of  orthodontic appliances (boa). the activities of cariogenic bacteria in bioflm on  these surfaces may contribute to dental caries, gingival infammation and periodontal disease. the pmma incorporated with nanoparti-cles of silver (nanoag-i-pmma) and nanoag in situ in pmma (nanoag-is-pmma) have been shown to control the growth of cariogenic bacteria, but clinical trial of anti-cariogenic  application of these novel materials in orthodontics has not been evaluated. the  main aim of the study is to compare the clinical effectiveness of using nanoag-is-pmma and nanoag-i-pmma for construction of new boa in inhibiting the planktonic growth and bioflm formation of the cariogenic bacteria. materials and  methods: twenty four patients with a median age of 12.6 years (7-15) harboring streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus and lactobacillus acidophilus as well as lactobacillus casei participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. the experimental boa, nanoag-is-boa and nanoag-i-boa, contained 0.5% w/w nanoag while the control boa was standard pmma. antibacterial effect of  nanoag-is-boa and nanoag-i-boa was assessed against test cariogenic bacteria by planktonic and bioflm bacterial cells growth inhibition. results: the average levels of test cariogenic bacteria in saliva decreased about 2 to 70 fold (30.9-98.4%) compared to baseline depending on the microorganism type and test boa. bioflm inhibition analysis demonstrated that nanoag-i-boa and nanoag-is-boa  inhibited the bioflm of all test bacteria by 20.1 to 79.9% compared to boa. nanoag-is-boa had a strong anti-bioflm effect against s. mutans, s. sobrinus and  l. casei. however, nanoag-i-boa showed only slight anti-bioflm effects on test bacteria. most notably, at all period of the clinical trial, nanoag-is-boa showed a higher antibacterial activity than nanoag-i-boa. conclusion: based on the novel data that presented here, the nanoag-is-boa had strong antimicrobial activity in  the planktonic phase and subsequent bioflm formation of the cariogenic bacteria.  clinical significance: wearing of nanoag-is-boa has the potential to minimize dental plaque formation and caries during orthodontic treatment.

TI  == innate immune response of pullets fed diets supplemented with prebiotics and synbiotics.
AB  == prebiotics and synbiotics are considered to be among the most promising replacements for in-feed antibiotic growth promoters (agp) in poultry feed. the current study was designed to study the effect of bacitracin methylene disalicylate (bmd) (control), yeast-derived carbohydrates (ydc), and a blend of ydc and probiotics [lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, streptococcus faecium, bacillus subtilis, and ydc] (snb) in the performance and innate immune response of pullets. feed intake and bw were measured on a weekly basis. at the end of the study (d 21), 10 birds/treatment were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and ileum, cecal tonsil, and spleen samples were collected for gene expression analysis. no significant difference (p > 0.05) in feed intake and g:f  was observed among treatments. in the second and third wk age, higher bw gain was observed in snb treatment compared to control and both control and ydc treatments, respectively. expression of tlr2b was upregulated in ydc and snb in the ileum, and in snb in the spleen (p < 0.05). expression of tlr4 was downregulated in snb in the cecal tonsil. expression of tlr21 was downregulated in ydc in the ileum, while it was upregulated in snb in the spleen (p < 0.05). in the ileum, ydc resulted in downregulated il-12p35, cxcli2, and il-13, and snb resulted in upregulated il-6, interferon (ifn)-gamma, and il-4 (p < 0.05). in the cecal tonsil, ydc resulted in upregulated il-12p35, il-2, il-13 and il-10, and snb resulted in downregulated il-2 and upregulated il-13 and il-10 (p < 0.05). in the spleen, ydc resulted in dowregulated il-2 and cxcli2, and snb resulted in upregulated il-6, ifn-gamma, il-4, and il-10 (p < 0.05). in conclusion, no change in performance was observed. innate immune response analysis showed snb with a more potent effect compared to ydc where the former showed a balanced t-helper (th)-1/th-2 response locally and a more th-2-dependent response systemically; snb might provide a more beneficial immune modulation with maintaining immune homeostasis, which was observed in a strong il-10 response.

TI  == an assessment of adhesion, aggregation and surface charges of lactobacillus strains derived from the human oral cavity.
AB  == there is limited information concerning the adhesion and aggregation of human oral lactobacilli. in this study, the adhesion of 10 lactobacillus species was investigated using h357 oral keratinocyte cells as an in vitro model for oral mucosa. coaggregation with the representative oral pathogen, streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, and the physicochemical cell properties was also evaluated. the results demonstrated significant variations in adhesion (42-96%) and aggregation  (autoaggregation, 14-95%; coaggregation, 19-65%). all strains showed a high affinity for chloroform, and most strains had a moderate-to-high hydrophobicity.  all strains, except lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus gasseri, showed a moderate affinity for ethyl acetate. there was a strong association of autoaggregation with coaggregation (rs = 0.883, p < 0.001). the highest mean for  autoaggregation (74%) and coaggregation (47%) belonged to the lact. gasseri strains. correlations between the adhesion and surface characteristics and aggregation were observed among the lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus paracasei strains; however, there was a variation in the strains properties within and between species. this study indicated that the lact. gasseri, lact. fermentum, and lact. paracasei strains might be potential probiotics for the human oral cavity given their desirable properties. it should also be emphasized  that a selective process for probiotic strains is required. significance and impact of the study: adhesion to host tissues and bacterial aggregation (auto- and coaggregation) are the highly important criteria for selecting strains with probiotic potential. these abilities are commonly involved with surface-charged characteristics. this is the first study to investigate the oral lactobacillus species using an oral keratinocyte cell line. significant results were found for  the correlations between the adhesion and surface charge characteristics and for  aggregation among certain strains of lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus paracasei. this observation could be useful when collecting background information for the selection of probiotic strains for use  in oral health.

TI  == nisin-induced expression of a recombinant antihypertensive peptide in dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == objective: to improve the process for the production of milk-derived antihypertensive peptides, including a 12-residue peptide (ffvapfpecvgk) from alphas1-casein. results: a synthetic gene encoding this peptide was cloned within the pediocin operon, replacing the nucleic acid sequence encoding the mature pediocin peptide (papa) and resulting in a translational fusion between the pediocin leader peptide and the 12-residue hypotensive (c-12) peptide. the recombinant operon was subsequently cloned immediately downstream of the nisa promoter to allow for inducible gene expression within streptococcus thermophilus st128, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ml3 and lactobacillus casei c2. rt-pcr was used to confirm recombinant gene expression in complex medium; and sds-page analysis showed that the pediocin secretion machinery, encoded by papc and papd,  allowed for secretion of the recombinant peptide from both l. lactis ml3 and l. casei c2 in a chemically defined medium. conclusion: the use of a nisin as a "food-grade" inducer molecule, and generally-regarded-as-safe lab species suggests that this system could be used for the production of functional food ingredients.

TI  == comparison of the antibacterial properties of three mouthwashes containing chlorhexidine against oral microbial plaques: an in vitro study.
AB  == background: the mouth provides an environment that allows the colonization and growth of a wide variety of microorganisms, especially bacteria. one of the most  effective ways to reduce oral microorganisms is using mouthwashes. objectives: the aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial effects of chlorhexidine mouthwashes (manufacture by livar, behsa, boht) on common oral microorganisms. materials and methods: in this in vitro study, isolated colonies  of four bacteria, including streptococcus mutans, s. sanguinis, s. salivarius and lactobacillus casei, were prepared for an antimicrobial mouth rinse test. the tube dilution method was used for determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc). results: the  mics for kin gingival, behsa and boht mouthwashes were 0.14, 0.48 and 1000 micrograms/ml using the tube method for s. mutans, respectively. the mbcs for the mentioned mouthwashes were 0.23, 1.9 and 2000 micrograms/ml for s. mutans, respectively. the mics for kin gingival, behsa and boht mouthwashes were 0.073, 0.48 and 250 micrograms/ml using the tube method for s. sanguinis, respectively.  the mbcs for the mentioned mouthwashes were 0.14, 1.9 and 1000 micrograms/ml for  s. sanguinis, respectively. conclusions: the kin gingival chlorhexidine mouthwash has a greater effect than behsa and boht mouthwashes on oral microorganisms and is recommended to be used for plaque chemical inhibition.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of apitoxin, melittin and phospholipase a(2) of honey bee  (apis mellifera) venom against oral pathogens.
AB  == in this work, we used the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) technique to evaluate the antibacterial potential of the apitoxin produced by apis mellifera bees against the causative agents of tooth decay. apitoxin was assayed in natura  and in the commercially available form. the antibacterial actions of the main components of this apitoxin, phospholipase a2, and melittin were also assessed, alone and in combination. the following bacteria were tested: streptococcus salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, lactobacillus casei,  and enterococcus faecalis. the mic results obtained for the commercially available apitoxin and for the apitoxin in natura were close and lay between 20 and 40 microg / ml, which indicated good antibacterial activity. melittin was the most active component in apitoxin; it displayed very promising mic values, from 4 to 40 microg / ml. phospholipase a2 presented mic values higher than 400 microg / ml. association of mellitin with phospholipase a2 yielded mic values ranging between 6 and 80 microg / ml. considering that tooth decay affects people's health, apitoxin and its component melittin have potential application against oral pathogens.

TI  == probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in older patients: a systematic review.
AB  == objective: here, we evaluated the efficacy of probiotic interventions in prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (aad) and clostridium difficile diarrhoea (cdd) in older patients. methods: pubmed, embase, central, cinahl, and  web of science were comprehensively searched from their dates of inception to may 2014. only randomised controlled trials reporting data on probiotics including lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, saccharomyces, streptococcus, enterococcus, and bacillus-alone or in combination-versus placebo or absence of treatment in older  patients (age >/=65 years) were included. risk ratios (rrs) for aad and cdd relative to placebo or absence of treatment were estimated. results: six trials with a total of 3562 patients were included. only one trial showed that bacillus  licheniformis was effective for preventing aad in older patients. however, there  was no preventive effect for aad and cdd with lactobacillus acidophilus (florajen), lactobacillus casei shirota, saccharomyces cerevisiae (boulardii) lyo, mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum (cultech strains), and mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus cul60, cul21, bifidobacterium  bifidum cul20 and b. lactis cul34. conclusions: our findings indicate that probiotics may not reduce the risk of aad and cdd in older patients. however, with current published data, it is difficult to draw concrete conclusions. to confirm these findings, sample sizes, multi-centre, double-blind studies that consider factors such as probiotic strains and types of antibiotics are required.

TI  == different bacterial models for in vitro induction of non-cavitated enamel caries-like lesions: microhardness and polarized light miscroscopy analyses.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare different bacterial models for in vitro induction of non-cavitated enamel caries-like lesions by microhardness and polarized light microscopy analyses. one hundred blocks of bovine enamel were randomly divided into four groups (n = 25) according to the bacterial model for caries induction: (a) streptococcus mutans, (b) s. mutans and lactobacillus acidophilus, (c) s. mutans and l. casei, and (d) s. mutans, l. acidophilus, and l. casei. within each group, the blocks were randomly divided into five subgroups according to the duration of the period of caries induction (4-20 days). the enamel blocks were immersed in cariogenic solution containing the microorganisms, which was changed every 48 h. groups c and d presented lower surface hardness values (smh) and higher area of hardness loss (deltas) after the cariogenic challenge than groups a and b (p < 0.05). as regards lesion depth, under polarized light microscopy, group a presented significantly lower values, and groups c and d the highest values. group b showed a higher value than group a (p  < 0.05). groups a and b exhibited subsurface caries lesions after all treatment durations, while groups c and d presented erosion-type lesions with surface softening. the model using s. mutans, whether or not it was associated with l. acidophilus, was less aggressive and may be used for the induction of non-cavitated enamel caries-like lesions. the optimal period for inducing caries-like lesions was 8 days. microsc. res. tech. 78:444-451, 2015.

TI  == improvement of exopolysaccharide production in lactobacillus casei lc2w by overexpression of nadh oxidase gene.
AB  == lactobacillus casei lc2w is an exopolysaccharide (eps)-producing strain with probiotic effects. to investigate the regulation mechanism of eps biosynthesis and to improve eps production through cofactor engineering, a h(2)o-forming nadh  oxidase gene was cloned from streptococcus mutans and overexpressed in l. casei lc2w under the control of constitutive promoter p(2)(3). the recombinant strain lc-nox exhibited 0.854 u/ml of nadh oxidase activity, which was elevated by almost 20-fold in comparison with that of wild-type strain. as a result, overexpression of nadh oxidase resulted in a reduction in growth rate. in addition, lactate production was decreased by 22% in recombinant strain. it was proposed that more carbon source was saved and used for the biosynthesis of eps,  the production of which was reached at 219.4 mg/l, increased by 46% compared to that of wild-type strain. this work provided a novel and convenient genetic approach to manipulate metabolic flux and to increase eps production. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report which correlates cofactor engineering  with eps production.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese.
AB  == the water buffalo mozzarella cheese is a typical italian cheese which has been introduced in the thriving brazilian market in the last 10 y, with good acceptance by its consumers. lactic acid bacteria (lab) play an important role in the technological and sensory quality of mozzarella cheese. in this study, the aim was to evaluate the diversity of the autochthones viable lab isolated from water buffalo mozzarella cheese under storage. samples were collected in 3 independent trials in a dairy industry located in the southeast region of brazil, on the 28th day of storage, at 4 masculinec. the lab were characterized by gram staining, catalase test, capacity to assimilate citrate, and production of co2 from glucose. the diversity of lab was evaluated by rapd-pcr (randomly amplified  polymorphic dna-polymerase chain reaction), 16s rrna gene sequencing, and by vitek 2 system. twenty lab strains were isolated and clustered into 12 different  clusters, and identified as streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and lactobacillus helveticus. enterococcus species were dominant and  citrate-positive. only the strains of l. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and l. fermentum produced co2 from glucose and were citrate-positive, while l. casei  was only citrate positive. this is the first report which elucidates the lab diversity involved in brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese. furthermore, the results show that despite the absence of natural whey cultures as starters in production, the lab species identified are the ones typically found in mozzarella cheese.

TI  == effects of biosurfactant produced by lactobacillus casei on gtfb, gtfc, and ftf gene expression level in s. mutans by real-time rt-pcr.
AB  == background: the streptococci are the pioneer strains in plaque formation and streptococcus mutans are the main etiological agent of dental plaque and caries.  in general, biofilm formation is a step-wise process, which begins by adhesion of planktonic cells to the surfaces. evidences show that expression of glucosyltransferase b and c (gtfb and gtfc) and fructosyltransferase (ftf) genes  play critical role in initial adhesion of s. mutans to the tooth surface which results in formation of dental plaques and consequently caries and other periodontal disease. materials and methods: the aim of this study was to determine the effect of biosurfactants produced by a probiotic strain; lactobacillus casei (atcc39392) on gene expression profile of gftb/c and tft of s. mutans (atcc35668) using quantitative real-time pcr. results: the application  of the prepared biosurfactant caused dramatic down regulation of all the three genes under study. the reduction in gene expression was statistically highly significant (for gtfb, p > 0.0002; for gtfc, p > 0.0063, and for ftf, p > 0.0057). conclusion: considerable downregulation of all three genes in the presence of the prepared biosurfactant comparing to untreated controls is indicative of successful inhibition of influential genes in bacterial adhesion phenomena. in view of the importance of glucosyltransferase gene products for s.mutans attachment to the tooth surface which is the initial important step in biofilm production and dental caries, further research in this field may lead to  an applicable alternative for successful with least adverse side effects in dental caries prevention.

TI  == molecular characterization of lactobacillus plantarum dmdl 9010, a strain with efficient nitrite degradation capacity.
AB  == nitrites commonly found in food, especially in fermented vegetables, are potential carcinogens. therefore, limiting nitrites in food is critically important for food safety. a lactobacillus strain (lactobacillus sp. dmdl 9010) was previously isolated from fermented vegetables by our group, and is not yet fully characterized. a number of phenotypical and genotypical approaches were employed to characterize lactobacillus sp. dmdl 9010. its nitrite degradation capacity was compared with four other lactobacillus strains, including lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus 719, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricu 1.83, streptococcus thermophilus 1.204, and lactobacillus plantarum 8140, on mrs medium. compared to these four lactobacillus strains, lactobacillus  sp. dmdl 9010 had a significantly higher nitrite degradation capacity (p<0.001).  based on 16s rdna sequencing and sequence comparison, lactobacillus sp. dmdl 9010 was identified as either lactobacillus plantarum or lactobacillus pentosus. to further identify this strain, the flanking regions (922 bp and 806 bp upstream and downstream, respectively) of the l-lactate dehydrogenase 1 (l-ldh1) gene were amplified and sequenced. lactobacillus sp. dmdl 9010 had 98.92 and 76.98% sequence identity in the upstream region with l. plantarum wcfs1 and l. pentosus  ig1, respectively, suggesting that lactobacillu sp. dmdl 9010 is an l. plantarum  strain. it was therefore named l. plantarum dmdl 9010. our study provides a platform for genetic engineering of l. plantarum dmdl 9010, in order to further improve its nitrite degradation capacity.

TI  == influence of a probiotic lactobacillus casei strain on the colonisation with potential pathogenic streptococci and staphylococcus aureus in the nasopharyngeal space of healthy men with a low baseline nk cell activity.
AB  == the effect of a daily intake of the probiotic strain lactobacillus casei shirota  (lcs) on the colonisation of pathogens, specifically streptococci and staphylococcus aureus, in the nose and throat of healthy human volunteers with low natural killer cell activity, was investigated in a randomised and controlled intervention study. the study consisted of a 2-week run-in phase, followed by a 4-week intervention phase. the probiotic treatment group received a fermented milk drink with lcs, while the placebo group received an equally composed milk drink without the probiotic additive. to isolate potential pathogenic streptococci and staph. aureus, samples from the pharynx, as well as of both middle nasal meati, were taken, once after the run-in phase and once at the end of the intervention phase. isolated bacteria were identified as either staph. aureus and alpha- or beta-haemolytic streptococci in a polyphasic taxonomical approach based on phenotypic tests, amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis  genotyping, and 16s rrna gene sequencing of representative strains. salivary secretory immunoglobulin a (siga) was used as marker of protective mucosal immunity to evaluate whether lcs treatment influenced siga production. no statistically significant effect could be determined for intervention with lcs on the incidence of staph. aureus in the nasal space, staph. aureus in the pharyngeal space or for beta-haemolytic streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae in the pharyngeal space. thus, the intervention did not influence the nasopharyngeal colonisation with gram-positive potential pathogens. production of salivary siga as a potential means of microbiota modulation was also not affected.

TI  == immunoreactivity of lactic acid-treated mare's milk after simulated digestion.
AB  == the similarity of mare's milk to breast milk makes it an interesting substrate for the creation of dairy beverages. the aim of this study was to determine the immunoreactivity of the digested mare's milk products carried out by lactic acid  fermentation with lactobacillus casei lcy, streptococcus thermophilus mk10 and bifidobacterium animalis bi30. simulation of digestion with saliva, pepsin and pancreatin/bile salts was carried out. the immunoreactivity of the milk proteins  was assessed by competitive elisa. the separation of proteins was studied using a tricine sds-page method. it has been demonstrated that lactic acid fermentation significantly decreases the immunoreactivity of beta-lactoglobulin, beta-casein,  kappa-casein and bovine serum albumin. the level of reduction was connected to the type of bacterial strain. the simulated digestion processes caused the decline of immunoreactivity, and the decreases obtained in the experiment were as follows: lactoferrin: 95%, beta-lactoglobulin: 94%, beta-casein: 93%, alpha-lactalbumin: 82%, alpha-casein: 82%, bovine serum albumin: 76% and kappa-casein: 37%. the results of the study indicated that microbial fermentation with tested strains is a valuable method for reducing the immunoreactivity of mare's milk proteins. however, further studies with other bacterial strains are needed to gain a higher level of elimination or total reduction of mare's milk immunoreactivity to possibly introduce fermented mare's milk into the diet of patients with immune-mediated digestive problems.

TI  == probiotics for preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  == background: ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) is common in intensive care units (icus). some evidence indicates that probiotics may reduce the incidence of vap. several additional published studies have demonstrated that probiotics are safe and efficacious in preventing vap in icus. we aimed to systematically summarise the results of all available data to generate the best evidence for the prevention of vap. objectives: to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for preventing vap. search methods: we searched central (2014, issue 8), medline (1948 to september week 1, 2014) and embase (2010 to september 2014). selection criteria: randomised controlled trials (rcts) comparing probiotics with placebo or another control (excluding rcts that use probiotics in both study groups) to prevent vap. data collection and analysis: two review authors independently assessed eligibility and the quality of trials, and extracted data. main results: we included eight rcts, with 1083 participants. all studies compared a form of probiotic (lactobacillus casei rhamnosus; lactobacillus plantarum; synbiotic 2000forte; ergyphilus; combination bifidobacterium longum +  lactobacillus bulgaricus + streptococcus thermophilus) versus a control group (placebo; glutamine; fermentable fibre; peptide; chlorhexidine). the analysis of  all rcts showed that the use of probiotics decreased the incidence of vap (odds ratio (or) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.52 to 0.95, low quality evidence). however, the aggregated results were uncertain for icu mortality (or 0.84, 95% ci 0.58 to 1.22 very low quality evidence), in-hospital mortality (or 0.78, 95% ci 0.54 to 1.14, very low quality evidence), incidence of diarrhoea (or 0.72, 95% ci 0.47 to 1.09, very low quality evidence), length of icu stay (mean difference (md) -1.60, 95% ci -6.53 to 3.33, very low quality evidence), duration of mechanical ventilation (md -6.15, 95% ci -18.77 to 6.47, very low quality evidence) and antibiotic use (or 1.23, 95% ci 0.51 to 2.96, low quality evidence). antibiotics for vap were used for a shorter duration (in days) when participants received probiotics in one small study (md -3.00, 95% ci -6.04 to 0.04). however, the ci of the estimated effect was too wide to exclude no difference with probiotics. there were no reported events of nosocomial probiotic infections in any included study.the overall methodological quality of the included studies, based on our 'risk of bias' assessments, was moderate with half of the included studies rated as a 'low' risk of bias; however, we rated four included studies as a 'high' risk of bias across one or more of the domains. the  study limitations, differences in probiotics administered and participants, and small sample sizes across the included studies mean that the power to detect a trend of overall effect may be limited and chance findings cannot be excluded.to  explore the influence of some potential confounding factors in the studies, we conducted an intention-to-treat (itt) analysis, which did not change the inference of per-protocol analysis. however, our sensitivity analysis did not indicate a significant difference between groups for instances of vap. authors' conclusions: evidence suggests that use of probiotics is associated with a reduction in the incidence of vap. however, the quality of the evidence is low and the exclusion of the one study that did not provide a robust definition of vap increased the uncertainty in this finding. the available evidence is not clear regarding a decrease in icu or hospital mortality with probiotic use. three trials reported on the incidence of diarrhoea and the pooled results indicate no  clear evidence of a difference. the results of this meta-analysis do not provide  sufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the efficacy and safety of probiotics  for the prevention of vap in icu patients.

AB  == one of the leading causes for the failure of dental composite restorations is secondary caries. effectively inhibiting cariogenic biofilms and reducing secondary caries could extend the service life of composite restorations. dental  composites releasing antibacterial agents such as chlorhexidine (chx) have shown  biofilm-inhibitory efficacy, but they usually have poor physical and mechanical properties. herein, we present a study of a new method to encapsulate and release chx from dental composite using mesoporous silica nanoparticles (msns). sba-15 msns were synthesized according to a reported procedure. chx (62.9 wt%) was encapsulated into dried msn from 0.3 m chx ethanol solution. the dental composites containing 0% (control), 3%, 5%, and 6.3% chx or the same amounts of chx entrapped in msn (denoted as chx@msn) were fabricated with methacrylate monomers and silanized glass fillers (chx or chx@msn + glass filler particle = 70 wt%). the monomer mixture consisted of bisphenol a glycidyl methacrylate (bisgma), hexanediol dimethacrylate (hddma), ethoxylated bisphenol a dimethacrylate (ebpadma), and urethane dimethacrylates (uedma) at a weight ratio  of 40:30:20:10. the composites were tested for chx release and recharge, flexural strength and modulus (at 24 hr and 1 mo), surface roughness, in vitro wear, and antibacterial activity against streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus casei (in both planktonic growth and biofilm formation). the results showed that the composites with chx@msn largely retained mechanical properties and smooth surfaces and showed controlled release of chx over a long time. in contrast, the  composites with directly mixed chx showed reduced mechanical properties, rough surfaces, and burst release of chx in a short time. the composites with chx either directly mixed or in msn showed strong inhibition to s. mutans and l. casei. this research has demonstrated the successful application of msns as a novel nanotechnology in dental materials to inhibit oral biofilm without sacrificing materials' mechanical properties and surface integrity.

TI  == safety of a nasal vaccine against streptococcus pneumoniae using heat-killed lactobacillus casei as adjuvant.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is a highly important respiratory pathogen that causes infections in children, elderly people and immunocompromised people around the world. pneumococcal vaccines licensed did not reach to eradicate the pneumococcal infection. in a previous study was demonstrated the effectiveness of a nasal experimental vaccine that consisted in a pneumococcal protective protein a (pppa) co-administrated with heat-killed-lactobacillus casei (lcm), in mice model of respiratory pneumococcal challenge. in the present work the safety of the experimental vaccine lcm+pppa and its components were evaluated through hematological, biochemical and immune parameters in a model infection with s. pneumoniae. thus, alanine transaminase activity, creatinine levels, lactate dehydrogenase activity, c reactive protein levels, corticosterone levels in serum, total and differential leukocyte counts in blood and bronchoalveolar lavages (bal) and ige in bal, were evaluated. experimental vaccine: lcm+pppa nasally administered does not induce harmful effects in our vaccination-infection model. studied parameters showed lcm+pppa's safety in liver, kidney, pulmonary and systemic levels. although studies in experimental animals do not guarantee security for the application of the vaccine on humans, they are important evidence for the planning and subsequent clinical trials in humans.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and synergism of lactoferrin and lysozyme against cariogenic microorganisms.
AB  == the present study evaluated the antimicrobial in vitro effects of the salivary proteins lactoferrin and lysozyme on microorganisms involved in the carious process, obtaining their minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc). streptococcus mutans (atcc 25175) and lactobacillus casei (atcc 7469) were submitted to broth macrodilution of lysozyme at 80 mg/ml and lactoferrin at 200 mg/ml. the tubes were read in a spectrophotometer after they had been incubated at 37 degrees c for 18 h, in a carbon dioxide chamber, in order to read the mic. a new subculture was carried on agar plates to obtain the mbc. the agar diffusion method was also tested, using bhi agar with 100 microl of the standardized microbial inocula. filter-paper disks soaked in 10 microl of the solutions lactoferrin (200 microg/ml) and lysozyme (80 microg/ml) were placed on the agar surface. inhibition halos were not observed on the plates, showing the absence of the antimicrobial effects of these proteins in this method. the bactericidal and bacteriostatic effects of lysozyme on l. casei were 50.3 mg/ml and 43.1 mg/ml respectively. the bactericidal and bacteriostatic effects on s. mutans were 68.5 mg/ml and 58.7 mg/ml. lactoferrin did not induce any inhibitory effects on any microorganism, even in the concentration of 200 mg/ml. there was not a synergic antimicrobial effect of proteins, when they were tested together, even in the concentration of  42.8 mg/ml of lysozyme and 114 mg/ml of lactoferrin (the highest values evaluated). s. mutans and l. casei were only inhibited by lysozyme, not affected  by lactoferrin and by the synergic use of both proteins.

TI  == microbial ecology dynamics reveal a succession in the core microbiota involved in the ripening of pasta filata caciocavallo pugliese cheese.
AB  == pyrosequencing of the 16s rrna targeting rna, community-level physiological profiles made with biolog ecoplates, proteolysis, and volatile component (voc) analyses were mainly used to characterize the manufacture and ripening of the pasta filata cheese caciocavallo pugliese. plate counts revealed that cheese manufacture affected the microbial ecology. the results agreed with those from culture-independent approaches. as shown by urea-page, reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (rp-hplc), and free-amino-acid (faa) analyses, the extent of secondary proteolysis mainly increased after 30 to 45 days of ripening. vocs and volatile free fatty acids (vffa) were identified by a purge-and-trap method (pt) and solid-phase microextraction (spme) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms), respectively. except for aldehydes, the levels of most of vocs and vffa mainly increased from 30 to 45 days onwards. as shown through pyrosequencing analysis, raw cows' milk was contaminated by firmicutes (53%), proteobacteria (39%), bacteroidetes (7.8%), actinobacteria (0.06%), and fusobacteria (0.03%), with heterogeneity at the genus level. the primary starter streptococcus thermophilus dominated the curd population. other genera occurred at low incidence or sporadically. the microbial dynamics reflected on the overall physiological diversity. at 30 days, a microbial succession was clearly highlighted. the relative abundance of streptococcus sp. and especially st. thermophilus decreased, while that of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus sp., and especially lactobacillus paracasei increased consistently. despite the lower relative abundance compared to st. thermophilus, mesophilic lactobacilli were the only organisms positively correlated with the concentration of faas, area of hydrophilic peptide peaks, and several vocs (e.g., alcohols, ketones, esters and all furans). this study showed that a core microbiota was naturally selected during middle ripening, which seemed to be the main factor responsible for cheese ripening.

TI  == synbiotic in the management of infantile colic: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  == aim: infant colic is a frequent problem affecting up to 10-30% of infants in first 3 months of life. results from previous trials have shown that manipulation of gut microbiota can lead to symptomatic improvements. in a randomised clinical  trial, we aimed to determine efficacy of synbiotic in reducing average infant crying time at day 7 and day 30 after starting intervention. methods: fifty breastfed infants aged 15-120 days with infantile colic randomly assigned to receive either the synbiotic sachet containing 1 billion cfu of: lactobacillus casei, l. rhamnosus, streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium breve, l. acidophilus, b. infantis, l. bulgaricus and fructooligosacharide (protexin healthcare, somerset, uk), or placebo daily for 30 days. parents were asked to record details of crying times in a symptoms diary. the primary outcome measure was the treatment success (reduction in the daily crying time >50%) and the secondary outcome measure was symptom resolution (reduction in the daily crying time >90%). results: the treatment success was significantly higher in synbiotic  group (82.6%) compared with placebo (35.7%) at day 7 (p < 0.005). at day30, treatment success was 87% and 46% in synbiotic and placebo group, respectively (p < 0.01). symptom resolution was also higher in synbiotic group (39%) compared with placebo (7%) at day 7 (p < 0.03) but not at day 30 (56% vs.36%, p = 0.24). we encountered no complication related to synbiotic use. conclusion: this synbiotic (a mixture of seven probiotic strains plus fos) significantly improved  colic symptoms in comparison with placebo.

TI  == propolis varnish: antimicrobial properties against cariogenic bacteria, cytotoxicity, and sustained-release profile.
AB  == varnishes are preparations that differ in the polymeric matrix and therapeutical  agents. in dentistry they are used to prevent caries. in this study we developed  a propolis varnish, considering propolis properties against cariogenic bacteria.  to a chitosan polymeric base (chv) was added ethanolic propolis extract in different concentrations: pv1 (5%), pv2 (10%), and pv3 (15%). antimicrobial activity was carried out against streptococcus mutans (sm), streptococcus sanguinis (sg), streptococcus salivarius (ss), and lactobacillus casei (lc) through agar diffusion method. the three propolis concentrations incorporated were effective in inhibiting the growth of all microorganisms, but without significant difference between the zones of inhibition observed. cytotoxicity assay was done by mtt method. data were analyzed by one-way anova and bonferroni  test. none of the varnishes were cytotoxic, keeping 80% of viable cells, while chv allowed cellular proliferation (120%). sustained-release test was carried out by applying 40 mu l of each varnish in the buccal surface of bovine teeth and kept in an ethanol/water solution removed in regular times. according to the "independent model approach," the release profiles were distinct from each varnish and the most prolonged was pv3 (8 weeks). varnish formulations had satisfactory antimicrobial activity against cariogenic bacteria and have a low cytotoxicity (<50%).

TI  == a comparative study of the effect of probiotics on cariogenic biofilm model for preventing dental caries.
AB  == dental caries is induced by oral biofilm containing streptococcus mutans. probiotic bacteria were mainly studied for effect on the gastrointestinal tract and have been known to promote human health. however, the information of probiotics for oral health has been lack yet. in this study, we investigated influence of various probiotics on oral bacteria or cariogenic biofilm and evaluated candidate probiotics for dental caries among them. the antimicrobial activity of the spent culture medium of probiotics for oral streptococci was performed. probiotics were added during the biofilm formation with salivary bacteria including s. mutans. the oral biofilms were stained with a fluorescent dye and observed using the confocal laser scanning microscope. to count bacteria  in the biofilm, the bacteria were plated on msb and bhi agar plates after disrupting the biofilm and cultivated. glucosyltransferases (gtfs) expression of  s. mutans and integration of lactobacilli into the biofilm were evaluated by real-time rt-pcr. among probiotics, lactobacillus species strongly inhibited growth of oral streptococci. moreover, lactobacillus species strongly inhibited formation of cariogenic biofilm model. the expression of gtfs was significantly reduced by lactobacillus rhamnosus. the integration of l. rhamnosus into the biofilm model did not exhibit. however, l. acidophilus and l casei integrated into the biofilm model. these results suggest that l. rhamnosus may inhibit oral  biofilm formation by decreasing glucan production of s. mutans and antibacterial  activity and did not integrate into oral biofilm, which can be a candidate for caries prevention strategy.

TI  == effect of a novel quaternary ammonium methacrylate polymer (qamp) on adhesion and antibacterial properties of dental adhesives.
AB  == this study investigated the resin-dentin bond strength (mutbs), degree of conversion (dc), and antibacterial potential of an innovative adhesive system containing a quaternary ammonium methacrylate polymer (qamp) using in situ and in vitro assays. forty-two human third molars were flattened until the dentin was exposed and were randomly distributed into three groups of self-etching adhesive  systems: clearfil se bond containing 5% qamp (experimental group), clearfil protect bond (positive control) and clearfil se bond (negative control). after light curing, three 1 mm-increments of composite resin were bonded to each dentin surface. a total of thirty of these bonded teeth (10 teeth per group) was sectioned to obtain stick-shaped specimens and tested under tensile stress immediately, and after 6 and 12 months of storage in distilled water. twelve bonded teeth (4 teeth per group) were longitudinally sectioned in a mesio-to-distal direction to obtain resin-bonded dentin slabs. in situ dc was evaluated by micro-raman spectroscopy. in vitro dc of thin films of each adhesive system was measured using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. in vitro susceptibility tests of these three adhesive systems were performed by the minimum inhibitory/minimum bactericidal concentration (mic/mbc) assays against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei, and actinomyces naeslundii. no statistically significant difference in mutbs was observed between clearfil se bond containing 5% qamp and clearfil se bond (p>0.05) immediately, and after 6 and 12 months of water storage. however clearfil protect bond showed a significant reduction of mutbs after 12 months of storage (p=0.039). in addition, qamp provided no significant change in dc after incorporating into clearfil se bond (p>0.05). clearfil se bond containing 5% qamp demonstrated mic/mbc values similar to the positive control against l. casei and a. naeslundii and higher than the negative control for all evaluated bacterial strains. the use of qamp in an adhesive system demonstrated effective bond strength, a suitable degree of conversion, and adequate antibacterial effects against oral bacteria, and may be  useful as a new approach to provide long-lasting results for dental adhesives.

TI  == molecular detection of bacteria associated to dental caries in 4-12-year-old tunisian children.
AB  == the occurrence of several microbial species in the oral cavity of 4-12-year-old tunisian children was investigated. samples were taken from 158 children (81 caries actives and 77 caries free). genomic dna was extracted and analyzed for the presence of 17 microbial species using a polymerase chain reaction assay. all samples were positive for at least one of the target microbial strains. streptococcus mutans was the most prevalent species (76.5%) detected in genomic dna collected from carious lesions. other prevalent species were candida spp (63%), streptococcus salivarius (59%) and streptococcus oralis (42%). the frequency of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus casei-group in caries lesions was 29.5%, 34.5% and 22% respectively. pathogenic bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus was found in 28.5% of carious lesion samples compared to 15.5% in the control. frequency of porphyromonas endodontali, actinomyces radicidentis and treponema denticola recovery did not differ significantly between origins of samples. pcr analysis of genomic dna detect various oral bacteria that differ between caries actives and caries-free children. in addition, the association of same aciduric bacteria (s.  mutans, s. salivarius, l. acidophilus) and caries formation was noticed.

TI  == the effect of five probiotic lactobacilli strains on the growth and biofilm formation of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == objective: to compare the effects of five probiotic lactobacilli strains on the growth and biofilm formation of streptococcus mutans (ms). materials and methods: five probiotic lactobacilli bacteria (lb), lactobacillus casei shirota, lactobacillus casei lc01, lactobacillus plantarum st-iii, lactobacillus paracasei lpc-37, and lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001, were used as test strains effecting on the streptococci strain s. mutans ua159 in this study. the effect of lb strains and their supernatants on the viability of the ms was evaluated. then, the effect of lb strains on the growth of ms biofilm formation was observed by fluorescence  microscope. results: all of the lb strains inhibited the growth of ms at concentrations of 1 x 10(8) and 3 x 10(8) cfu ml(-1) (p < 0.05). untreated (without ph adjustment and ultrafiltration) lb supernatants from all of the lb strains inhibited the growth of ms (p < 0.05) as well. after ph adjustment and ultrafiltration (treated), only supernatants from l. casei shirota and l. rhamnosus hn001 inhibited the growth of ms (p < 0.05). ms biofilm formation was also inhibited by all untreated supernatants and by the treated supernatants of l. casei shirota and l. rhamnosus hn001 (p < 0.05). conclusion: all five probiotic lactobacilli strains inhibited the growth and biofilm formation of ms,  likely through the production of an acid environment, bacteriocin-like poly peptides, or both, and the effects on ms were dependent on the lb strains used.

TI  == probiotic viability and storage stability of yogurts and fermented milks prepared with several mixtures of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == currently, the food industry wants to expand the range of probiotic yogurts but each probiotic bacteria offers different and specific health benefits. little information exists on the influence of probiotic strains on physicochemical properties and sensory characteristics of yogurts and fermented milks. six probiotic yogurts or fermented milks and 1 control yogurt were prepared, and we evaluated several physicochemical properties (ph, titratable acidity, texture, color, and syneresis), microbial viability of starter cultures (lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus) and probiotics (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus reuteri) during fermentation and storage (35 d at 5 degrees c), as well as sensory preference among them. decreases in ph (0.17 to 0.50 units) and increases in titratable acidity (0.09 to 0.29%) were observed during storage. only the yogurt  with s. thermophilus, l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and l. reuteri differed in  firmness. no differences in adhesiveness were determined among the tested yogurts, fermented milks, and the control. syneresis was in the range of 45 to 58%. no changes in color during storage were observed and no color differences were detected among the evaluated fermented milk products. counts of s. thermophilus decreased from 1.8 to 3.5 log during storage. counts of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus also decreased in probiotic yogurts and varied from 30 to 50% of initial population. probiotic bacteria also lost viability throughout storage, although the 3 probiotic fermented milks maintained counts >/= 10(7)cfu/ml for 3 wk. probiotic bacteria had variable viability in yogurts, maintaining counts of l. acidophilus >/= 10(7) cfu/ml for 35 d, of l. casei for 7d, and of l. reuteri for 14 d. we found no significant sensory preference among  the 6 probiotic yogurts and fermented milks or the control. however, the yogurt and fermented milk made with l. casei were better accepted. this study presents relevant information on physicochemical, sensory, and microbial properties of probiotic yogurts and fermented milks, which could guide the dairy industry in developing new probiotic products.

TI  == antibacterial action of chlorhexidine/thymol containing varnishes in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == objectives: the antibacterial activity of two different formulations of a chlorhexidine/thymol varnish should be elucidated in vitro and in vivo. methods:  the agar diffusion assay with cervitec((r)) and cervitecplus((r)) and three reference strains each of streptococci, lactobacilli, actinomyces and periodontal pathogens was performed. in a split-mouth study, 40 volunteers applied the test (cervitecplus((r)), solvent water and ethanol) and control (cervitec((r)), solvent ethyl acetate) varnish at buccal recessions of premolar teeth at baseline as well as after two, four and seven days. supra- and subgingival plaques were collected 2 weeks before baseline and at the screening appointments. supragingival plaque was analysed for mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and subgingival samples for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and porphyromonas intermedia. friedman/wilcoxon tests and u-test were used for statistical analysis (p < 0.05). results: most reference strains were susceptible with inhibition zones (mm) as follows: cervitec((r))/cervitecplus((r)) streptococci 27 +/- 1.7/21.3 +/- 2.5, lactobacilli 26 +/- 9.2/23.7 +/- 4.9, actinomyces 36.3 +/- 6.6/27.3 +/- 1.5, periodontal pathogens 18.7 +/- 7.6/18 +/- 1.7. both varnishes reduced significantly the counts of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in the patients. however, no significant differences were found between test and control sides at  any time. the total counts of periodontal pathogens were low. a tendency to higher counts of a. actinomycetemcomitans at the control side could be shown; the test side did not harbour significantly higher counts. conclusion: both varnishes may influence the plaque formation and reduce mutans streptococci in supragingival plaque.

AB  == the chemical composition of the essential oil isolated from the aerial parts of melampodium divaricatum (rich.) dc. (asteraceae) was characterized by gc-fid and  gc/ms analyses. (e)-caryophyllene (56.0%), germacrene d (12.7%), and bicyclogermacrene (9.2%) were identified as the major oil components. the antimicrobial activity of the oil against seven standard strains of oral pathogens from the american type culture collection (atcc) was evaluated by determining minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) using the microdilution method. mic values below 100 mug/ml were obtained against streptococcus sobrinus  (90 mug/ml), lactobacillus casei (30 mug/ml), s. mutans (20 mug/ml), and s. mitis (18 mug/ml). in contrast, the mic values of the major oil compound (e)-caryophyllene were higher than 400 mug/ml against all pathogens, suggesting that the activity of the oil might depend on minor oil components and/or on synergistic effects. the m. divaricatum essential oil is a promising agent to include in anticariogenic oral rinse formulations for the control of oral pathogens.

TI  == biodegradable nanofibrous drug delivery systems: effects of metronidazole and ciprofloxacin on periodontopathogens and commensal oral bacteria.
AB  == objectives: the purposes of this study were to fabricate biodegradable polydioxanone (pds ii(r)) electrospun periodontal drug delivery systems (hereafter referred to as matrices) containing either metronidazole (met) or ciprofloxacin (cip) and to investigate the effects of antibiotic incorporation on both periodontopathogens and commensal oral bacteria. materials and methods: fibrous matrices were processed from pds polymer solution by electrospinning. antibiotic-containing pds solutions were prepared to obtain four distinct groups: 5 wt.% met, 25 wt.% met, 5 wt.% cip, and 25 wt.% cip. pure pds was used as a control. high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) was done to evaluate met and cip release. dual-species biofilms formed by lactobacillus casei (lc) and streptococcus salivarius (ss) were grown on the surface of all electrospun matrices. after 4 days of biofilm growth, the viability of bacteria on biofilms was assessed. additionally, antimicrobial properties were evaluated against periodontopathogens fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) using agar diffusion assay. results: a three-dimensional interconnected porous network was observed in the different fabricated matrices. pure pds showed the highest fiber diameter mean (1,158 +/- 402 nm) followed in a descending order by groups 5 wt.% met (1,108 +/- 383 nm), 25 wt.% met (944 +/- 392 nm), 5 wt.% cip (871 +/- 309 nm), and 25 wt.% cip (765 +/- 288 nm). hplc demonstrated that groups containing higher amounts (25 wt.%) of incorporated drugs released more over time, while those with lower levels (5 wt.%) the least. no inhibitory effect of the tested antibiotics was detected on biofilm formation by the tested commensal oral bacteria. meanwhile, cip-containing matrices inhibited growth of fn and aa. conclusion: cip-containing matrices led to a significant inhibition of periodontopathogens without negatively impairing the growth of periodontal beneficial bacteria. clinical relevance: based on the proven in vitro inhibition of periodontitis-related bacteria, future in vivo research using relevant animal models is needed to confirm the effectiveness of these drug delivery systems.

TI  == antibacterial activity of selected glass ionomer cements.
AB  == introduction: the aim of the paper was to determine the antibacterial activity of four glass ionomer cements against bacteria of the genera streptococcus and lactobacillus. material and methods: four capsulated glass ionomer cements were applied in the study: fuji triage (gc), fuji ix (gc), ketac molar (3m espe) and ketac silver (3m espe). four standard bacterial strains were used to assess the antibacterial activity of the studied cements: streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis,  s. salivarius and lactobacillus casei. the antibacterial activity was determined  by the agar diffusion method. the bacterial suspension was spread with a cotton swab on tsa plates. for each material six wells (7 mm diameter, 5 mm deep) were made with a cork borer. each well was then filled with freshly prepared cements.  the results were obtained by measuring the bacterial growth inhibition zone after 1, 2, 3 and 7 days. results: fuji triage cement inhibited the growth of all bacterial strains. fuji ix cement demonstrated the most potent antibacterial activity against s. sanguis. ketac molar showed antibacterial activity against s. sanguis and s. salivarius, whereas ketac silver was efficient against s. mutans as well. neither of the ketac cements inhibited growth of the standard l. casei strain. discussion: antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements has attracted the interest of scientists in recent years. most authors, including us, carried out experiments using the agar diffusion method and demonstrated antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements. different antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements, observed in our study and studies of other authors, depended on  the evaluated cement, bacterial strain and period of evaluation.

TI  == antibacterial activity, fluoride release, and physical properties of an antibiotic-modified glass ionomer cement.
AB  == purpose: this study's purpose was to examine the influence of adding an antibiotic mixture to conventional glass ionomer cement (gic) on its antibacterial activity, fluoride-releasing ability, and physical properties. methods: an antibiotic mixture containing ciprofloxacin and metronidazole was added to gic at concentration ratios of one percent weight antibiotic/weight total powder before mixing (w/w; group 1) and two percent w/w (group 2) to obtain the test groups. conventional gic served as the control. the antibacterial activity of the cement specimens was evaluated against streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus casei using the agar inhibition test. the fluoride release from the cement specimens was evaluated using a fluoride ion selective electrode. the physical parameters evaluated were net setting time, compressive strength, shear  bond strength, and microleakage. results: group 2 showed a significantly greater  inhibition zone than group 1 against both tested organisms, while the control did not inhibit organism growth. the addition of antibiotics at one percent and two percent to gic enhanced its fluoride release. at two percent, however, the physical properties of gic were adversely affected. conclusion: antibiotics at one percent weight solute/weight total solution after mixing may modestly confer  an antibacterial activity to glass ionomer cement and enhance its fluoride-releasing ability. its effects on shear bond strength and microleakage were found to be encouraging.

TI  == viability of probiotic lactobacillus casei in yoghurt: defining the best processing step to its addition.
AB  == probiotics are live microorganisms capable of producing beneficial effects on its host when consumed in adequate amounts. to exert these effects, foods must contain probiotic microorganisms in populations above 10(6) cfu/g or ml throughout its shelf life. one of the strategies to ensure high population of probiotics in fermented milk is to add them during or after the fermentation process separately from the starter cultures. the objective of this study was to  investigate the behavior of the probiotic microorganism lactobacillus casei added to yoghurt in different stages of production. yoghurts with l. casei were produced at different stages: before addition of starter (streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus),  added together with this culture and at the end of fermentation. yoghurt without  probiotic added was produced as a control. the products were stored at 4 degrees  c and analyzed after 1, 7, 14 and 21 days of storage. in these periods, the populations ofprobiotic and starter cultures were enumerated and the parameters ph and acidity were analyzed. the results were evaluated using analysis of variance and tukey's test, both at 5% significance level. l. casei remained viable in populations of more than 10(8) cfu / g during 21 days of storage, which is suitable to define the formulations as probiotics. when the different stages of the addition of probiotics in yoghurts were evaluated there was no statistical difference between the formulations (p < 0.05) for populations of l. casei except for the first day of storage.

TI  == significant effect of ca2+ on improving the heat resistance of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the heat resistance of lactic acid bacteria (lab) has been extensively investigated due to its highly practical significance. reconstituted skim milk (rsm) has been found to be one of the most effective protectant wall materials for microencapsulating microorganisms during convective drying, such as spray drying. in addition to proteins and carbohydrate, rsm is rich in calcium. it is not clear which component is critical in the rsm protection mechanism. this study investigated the independent effect of calcium. ca(2+) was added to lactose solution to examine its influence on the heat resistance of lactobacillus rhamnosus zy, lactobacillus casei zhang, lactobacillus plantarum p8 and streptococcus thermophilus nd03. the results showed that certain ca(2+) concentrations enhanced the heat resistance of the lab strains to different extents, that is produced higher survival and shorter regrowth lag times of the bacterial cells. in some cases, the improvements were dramatic. more scientifically insightful and more intensive instrumental study of the ca(2+) behavior around and in the cells should be carried out in the near future. in the meantime, this work may lead to the development of more cost-effective wall materials with ca(2+) added as a prime factor.

TI  == a defined-multispecies microbial model for studying enamel caries development.
AB  == the aims of this study were to describe and validate an in vitro multispecies microbial biofilm model for caries development by evaluating the effects of varying medium concentration of sucrose (0.5 and 1.0%) and fluoride (0.4, 0.8 and 1.0 ppm f) in study 1, and calcium (1.0 and 2.0 mm ca) in study 2. defined-multispecies biofilms, formed by lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mutans, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, were grown on the surface of salivary-pellicle-coated enamel slabs, with known baseline surface hardness; growth medium was changed daily. counts of viable cells on biofilms and the percentage of surface microhardness change (%smc), lesion depth (ld) and integrated mineral loss (iml) on enamel slabs were assessed after 4 days of biofilm formation under the tested conditions. counts of viable cells on biofilms were significantly affected by sucrose, fluoride and calcium concentrations (p <  0.05). there was a decrease in %smc in response to increased fluoride and calcium concentrations (p < 0.001). lower iml (p < 0.001) and ld (p < 0.05) were found in the presence of 0.8 and 1.0 ppm f. a negative correlation was found between the response variables (%smc, ld and iml) and fluoride and calcium concentrations. the results suggest that the microbial caries model developed was able to show distinct levels of caries inhibition in response to fluoride and calcium concentrations, corroborating clinical observations. an effect of sucrose concentration on caries development was found only in the presence of the lowest  fluoride concentration.

TI  == high strength re-mineralizing, antibacterial dental composites with reactive calcium phosphates.
AB  == objective: development of high strength dental composites with adhesive, antibacterial and re-mineralizing potential. materials: urethane and triethylene  glycol dimethacrylates were combined with hema (10 or 20wt%) and 2mp (2 or 10wt%), antibacterial chlorhexidine (2.5wt%) and chemical cure initiators. reactive mono/tri calcium phosphate (cp) mixed with silica/silicon carbide nanoparticles (s) (cp:s weight ratio 1:2 or 2:1) was added (50wt%). results: decreasing cp/s ratio and hema content reduced monomer conversion at 15min from 93 to 63%. conversely, decreasing cp/s increased initial "dry" compressive (137-203mpa) and flexural (79-116mpa) strength. with high hema content, these decreased by approximately 15-20mpa upon 24h water storage. with low hema content, average decline was <8mpa due to reduced water sorption. early water sorption induced mass increase, volume expansion, mono calcium phosphate dissolution and chlorhexidine release, were proportional to the initial calcium phosphate content. furthermore, they increased approximately 1.5 fold upon raising hema wt%. these diffusion controlled processes and strength decline slowed after 24h as phosphates reaction bound water within the materials. increasing 2mp concentration reduced calcium release but did not affect strength. formulations with high cp/s indicated greater antibacterial activity in agar diffusion and in vitro biofilm tests. significance: new material use beneath a conventional composite could potentially reduce high failure rates associated with residual caries and bacterial microleakage.

TI  == increasing antioxidant activity of procyanidin extracts from the pericarp of litchi chinensis processing waste by two probiotic bacteria bioconversions.
AB  == litchi chinensis pericarp from litchi processing waste is an important plant source of a-type procyanidins, which were considered a natural dietary supplement because of their high biological activity in vivo. litchi pericarp oligomeric procyanidins (lpopcs) did not selectively modify the growth of streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus casei -01 at concentrations of 0.25 and 0.5 mg/ml, and it was demonstrated that the two strains could transform procyanidins during  their log period of growth by two different pathways. s. thermophilus was able to metabolize procyanidin a2 to its isomer, and l. casei could decompose flavan-3-ols into 3,4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 4-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid, m-coumaric acid, and p-coumaric acid. the total antioxidant capability (t-aoc) of lpopcs before and after microbial incubation was estimated, and the results suggested that probiotic bacteria bioconversion is a feasible and efficient method to convert litchi pericarp procyanidins to a more effective antioxidant agent.

TI  == clinical and microbiological evaluation of the carious dentin before and after application of papacarie gel.
AB  == objective: to evaluate clinically and microbiologically the efficacy of papacarie in the removal of carious dentin in both permanent and primary teeth. study design: thirty permanent and primary molars with dentinal carious lesions were excavated and subjected to clinical and microbiological assessment before and after application of papacarie. the gel was further tested for in vitro antimicrobial efficacy against standard cariogenic micro-organisms using agar diffusion assay. results: papacarie was able to differentiate between infected and affected dentin clinically along with high patient comfort during caries excavation. the mean time taken for caries removal and restoration was observed to be 4.17 +/- 0.40 min. and 8.57 +/- 0.45 min. for permanent teeth and 4.21 +/-  0.36 min. and 9.24 +/- 0.58 min. for primary teeth. there was a significant reduction in the total viable colony forming units from the dentin samples before and after application of papacarie. it was also observed that papacarie had no inhibitory effect on standard cariogenic microorganisms in the agar diffusion assay. conclusions: papacarie is an effective caries removal method clinically in both permanent and primary teeth. the number of viable microorganisms after complete caries excavation using papacarie still appears to be high and this bacterial count should be tackled by a suitable restorative material with potent  antimicrobial activity.

TI  == salivary streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli levels following probiotic cheese  consumption in adults: a double blind randomized clinical trial(*).
AB  == background: the beneficial effects of lactobacillus species have been reported but the role of these species including lactobacillus casei (l. casei) on oral health is not well documented. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of conventional or probiotic cheese containing l.casei on salivary streptococcus mutans (sm) and lactobacilli levels. methods: in this double-blind  controlled trial (irct201009144745n1), 60 adults were randomly allocated in 2 parallel blocks. sm and lactobacilli count assessment were performed three times. subjects consumed either cheese containing l. casei (1x10(6)cfu/g) (probiotic block, n=29) or cheese without any probiotic (control block, n=31) twice daily for two weeks. bacterial levels changes were compared using wilcoxon and mann-whitney tests. logistic regression compared changes in number of subjects with lowest and highest sm or lactobacilli levels. results: statistically significant (p = 0.001) reduction of salivary sm was found in probiotic group. sm levels reduction was not significant between placebo and trial groups (p = 0.46,  62% in probiotic vs. 32% in placebo group). lacto-bacilli count changes during trial were not statistically significant inter and intra blocks (p = 0.12). probiotic intervention was significantly effective in high levels (> 10(5)cfu/ml) of sm (odds ratio 11.6, 95% ci 1.56-86.17, p = 0.017). conclusions: probiotic cheese containing l. casei was not effective in salivary sm levels reduction comparing to conventional cheese. adding l. casei to cheese could be useful in decreasing sm counts in adults 18-37 years old with highest level of sm.

TI  == potentiation by metal ions of the efficacy of the ionophores, monensin and tetronasin, towards four species of ruminal bacteria.
AB  == concentrations of na(+), k(+) and ca(2+) in the growth medium were varied within  limits normally found in vivo to determine how cation concentrations affect the sensitivity of ruminal bacteria to the ionophores, monensin (a na(+)/h(+) and k(+)/h(+) exchanger) and tetronasin (ca(2+)/h(+)). high [na(+)] (172 mm cf. 137 mm in control medium) enhanced the efficacy of monensin towards eubacterium ruminantium 2388, streptococcus bovis c277, lactobacillus casei lb17 and prevotella albensis m384. high [k(+)] (35 mm cf. 19 mm) alone caused a decreased  potency of both ionophores, except with l. casei. added ca(2+) (7.4 cf. 2.8 mm) increased the potency of tetronasin when [na(+)] was low. high [na(+)] alone also potentiated the efficacy of tetronasin. monensin caused intracellular [na(+)] and [k(+)] to be decreased in the most sensitive of these organisms, e. ruminantium,  whereas only intracellular [ca(2+)] fell with tetronasin. the changes were small; however, deltap fell by only 20 mv after 2 h when ionophores caused immediate cessation of growth. atp concentrations fell by 77% and 75% with monensin and tetronasin, respectively. thus, altering cation concentrations might be used to potentiate the efficacy of ionophores, by increasing the rate of energy expenditure to maintain ionic homoeostasis in sensitive bacteria.

TI  == microbial colonization in orthodontic mini-implants.
AB  == peri-implant inflammation contributes for loss of secondary stability of orthodontic mini-implants. the investigation of microbial colonization in this area would benefit its control, and consequently favor the long-term success of mini-implants. therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the establishment and the evolution of microbial colonization process in orthodontic  mini-implants for 3 months, since the time of their installation. one-hundred and fifty samples collected from 15 mini-implants were investigated from baseline up  to 3 months. the biological material was obtained from peri-implant area using paper points. nonspecific, streptococcus spp, lactobacillus casei and candida spp colonizations were analyzed by cell growth methods. porphyromonas gingivalis colonization was observed by 16s rdna-directed polymerase chain reaction. data from cell growth were submitted to the wilcoxon sign rank test and results from molecular analysis were presented in a descriptive way. there was no significant  difference in the microbial colonization among the examined time intervals, except for streptococcus spp, between baseline and 24 h, which characterized the  initial colonization in this time interval. lactobacillus casei and candida spp colonizations were insignificant. no porphyromonas gingivalis was detected among  the analyzed samples. the microbial colonization of mini-implants did not significantly change during the study. however, it should be monitored by orthodontists, since it is an important factor for mini-implants success.

TI  == comparative study of the antimicrobial effect of three irrigant solutions (chlorhexidine, sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidinated mums).
AB  == aim: to compare the antimicrobial effect of 2% chlorhexidine, 2.5% sodium hypochlorite and mums containing 2% chlorhexidine. materials and methods: all of  the above irrigants were examined on enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans, candida albicans, lactobacillus casei and e. coli. a total of 0.5 cc of each solution and 0.5 cc of mcfarland solution bacterium were added to each examination tube. after 15, 30 and 45 minutes, colony count was performed for each tube. the difference in the number of bacteria indicated the effect taken by disinfectant material. results: mums containing chlorhexidine showed the antimicrobial properties just like chlorhexidine's effect against e. coli, streptococcus mutans, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis and lactobacillus casei in preventing these entire microorganisms to incubate. sodium hypochlorite  was not effective against enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans incubated in 15, 30 and 45 minutes and enterococcus faecalis in 15 minutes. conclusion: mums has antimicrobial properties similar to chlorhexidine. clinical significance: as  mums containing chlorhexidine can transfer chlorhexidine through its own surfactant around apical area and it can open the dentinal tubules by its own chelator for more penetration of chlorhexidine, it may be a choice for canal irrigation.

TI  == incorporation of antimicrobial agents can be used to enhance the antibacterial effect of endodontic sealers.
AB  == aim: the antibacterial activity of five endodontic sealers against three different microorganism strains alone and following incorporation of 2% benzalkonium chloride (bc) and 2% cetylpyridinium chloride (cpc) was evaluated. methodology: the agar diffusion method was used to determine the inhibitory effect of the following endodontic sealers: roekoseal, endomethasone n, n2, apexit plus and ah plus, on streptococcus mutans - atcc 25175, lactobacillus casei - atcc 4646 and actinomyces viscosus - atcc 19246. bacterial strains were inoculated into bhib, and incubated in an anaerobic atmosphere (37 degrees c). from the bacteria grown in the liquid medium, the density of the inoculum was set to be equivalent to mcfarland 2 standard. in shaedler agar, 350 mul of the bacterial suspension were equally spread. specimens (4 mm x 6 mm) were prepared from each material without and with addition of 2% bc or 2% cpc. the inhibition zones were determined after 2 days, after 7 days and after 21 days of incubation. results: the largest inhibition zones were shown at zero time in all cases, with  progressively less inhibition at 7 and 21 days. endomethasone n and n2 showed the most intense antimicrobial activity, while roekoseal showed the least antimicrobial effect. the most susceptible microorganism was a. viscosus. greater antimicrobial effects were found following incorporation of bc or cpc, and generally, bc gave greater inhibition zones than cpc. conclusions: adding either  bc or cpc has the potential to improve clinical outcomes with endodontic sealers, as these substances enhance the short-term antimicrobial effects of the sealers.

TI  == modulation of the immuno-coagulative response in a pneumococcal infection in malnourished mice nasally treated with lactobacillus casei.
AB  == we studied the systemic effects of the intranasal administration of lactobacillus casei on the immuno-coagulative response in pneumoccocal infection in immunocompromised mice. weaned mice consumed a protein-free diet (pfd) for 21 days and were therefore malnourished. malnourished mice were fed a balanced conventional diet (bcd) for 7 days (bcd group) or a bcd for 7 days with nasal administration of viable l. casei on days 6 and 7 (bcd+lcn group). the malnourished control mice (mnc) received a pfd, whereas the well-nourished control mice (wnc) continually consumed a bcd. at the end of the treatment period, the mice were infected with streptococcus pneumoniae. at different times  after infection, we analysed the following parameters: global coagulation system, activation of coagulation, coagulation inhibitors, platelet count, leukocyte count and myeloperoxidase (mpo) activity, total proteins, albumin and acute phase proteins (apps). the mnc group showed greater impairment in the coagulation tests and an increase in the positive apps. these parameters were normalized by the l.  casei treatment. however, the number of leukocytes, decreased by malnutrition, was improved only by the administration of l. casei. after infection, the bcd+lcn group showed similar results to those of the wnc group for most of the haemostatic parameters. the bcd+lcn group did not show significant variations in  the prothrombin time or in the level of anticoagulant protein c, but showed higher levels of fibrinogen, platelets, albumin, leukocytes and mpo activity compared with the different experimental groups. the intranasal administration of l. casei was effective in modulating the pro-inflammatory aspects of coagulation  without affecting coagulation itself.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from cheeses and yogurts.
AB  == the biopreservation of foods using bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated directly from foods is an innovative approach. the objectives of this study were to isolate and identify bacteriocinogenic lab from various cheeses and yogurts and evaluate their antimicrobial effects on selected spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in vitro as well as on a food commodity.lab were isolated using mrs and m17 media. the agar diffusion bioassay was used to screen  for bacteriocin or bacteriocin-like substances (bls) producing lab using lactobacillus sakei and listeria innocua as indicator organisms. out of 138 lab isolates, 28 were found to inhibit these bacteria and were identified as strains  of enterococcus faecium, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei using 16s rrna gene sequencing. eight isolates were tested for antimicrobial activity at 5 degrees c and 20 degrees c against l. innocua, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas fluorescens, erwinia carotovora, and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides using the agar diffusion bioassay, and also against penicillium expansum, botrytis cinerea and monilinia frucitcola using the microdilution plate method. the effect of selected lab strains on l. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions was also investigated.twenty percent of our isolates produced bls inhibiting the growth of l. innocua and/or lact. sakei. organic acids and/or h2o2 produced by lab and not  the bls had strong antimicrobial effects on all microorganisms tested with the exception of e. coli. ent. faecium, strep. thermophilus and lact. casei effectively inhibited the growth of natural microflora and l. innocua inoculated  onto fresh-cut onions. bacteriocinogenic lab present in cheeses and yogurts may have potential to be used as biopreservatives in foods.

TI  == diversity in growth and protein degradation by dairy relevant lactic acid bacteria species in reconstituted whey.
AB  == the high nutritional value of whey makes it an interesting substrate for the development of fermented foods. the aim of this work was to evaluate the growth and proteolytic activity of sixty-four strains of lactic acid bacteria in whey to further formulate a starter culture for the development of fermented whey-based beverages. fermentations were performed at 37 degrees c for 24 h in 10 and 16% (w/v) reconstituted whey powder. cultivable populations, ph, and proteolytic activity (o-phthaldialdehyde test) were determined at 6 and 24 h incubation. hydrolysis of whey proteins was analysed by tricine sds-page. a principal component analysis (pca) was applied to evaluate the behaviour of strains. forty-six percent of the strains grew between 1 and 2 deltalog cfu/ml while 19% grew less than 0.9 deltalog cfu/ml in both reconstituted whey solutions. regarding the proteolytic activity, most of the lactobacilli released amino acids and small peptides during the first 6 h incubation while streptococci consumed the amino acids initially present in whey to sustain growth. whey proteins were degraded by the studied strains although to different extents. special attention  was paid to the main allergenic whey protein, beta-lactoglobulin, which was degraded the most by lactobacillus acidophilus crl 636 and lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus crl 656. the strain variability observed and the pca applied in this study allowed selecting appropriate strains able to improve the nutritional characteristics (through amino group release and protein degradation) and storage (decrease in ph) of whey.

TI  == lactocepin secreted by lactobacillus exerts anti-inflammatory effects by selectively degrading proinflammatory chemokines.
AB  == the intestinal microbiota has been linked to inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd), and oral treatment with specific bacteria can ameliorate ibd. one bacterial mixture, vsl#3, containing lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, and streptococcus, was clinically shown to reduce inflammation in ibd patients and normalize intestinal  levels of ip-10, a lymphocyte-recruiting chemokine, in a murine colitis model. we identified lactobacillus paracasei prtp-encoded lactocepin as a protease that selectively degrades secreted, cell-associated, and tissue-distributed ip-10, resulting in significantly reduced lymphocyte recruitment after intraperitoneal injection in an ileitis model. a human lactobacillus casei isolate was also found to encode lactocepin and degrade ip-10. l. casei feeding studies in a murine colitis model (t cell transferred rag2(-/-) mice) revealed that a prtp-disruption mutant was significantly less potent in reducing ip-10 levels, t cell infiltration and inflammation in cecal tissue compared to the isogenic wild-type  strain. thus, lactocepin-based therapies may be effective treatments for chemokine-mediated diseases like ibd.

TI  == using high throughput sequencing to explore the biodiversity in oral bacterial communities.
AB  == high throughput sequencing of 16s ribosomal rna gene amplicons is a cost-effective method for characterization of oral bacterial communities. however, before undertaking large-scale studies, it is necessary to understand the technique-associated limitations and intrinsic variability of the oral ecosystem. in this work we evaluated bias in species representation using an in vitro-assembled mock community of oral bacteria. we then characterized the bacterial communities in saliva and buccal mucosa of five healthy subjects to investigate the power of high throughput sequencing in revealing their diversity  and biogeography patterns. mock community analysis showed primer and dna isolation biases and an overestimation of diversity that was reduced after eliminating singleton operational taxonomic units (otus). sequencing of salivary  and mucosal communities found a total of 455 otus (0.3% dissimilarity) with only  78 of these present in all subjects. we demonstrate that this variability was partly the result of incomplete richness coverage even at great sequencing depths, and so comparing communities by their structure was more effective than comparisons based solely on membership. with respect to oral biogeography, we found inter-subject variability in community structure was lower than site differences between salivary and mucosal communities within subjects. these differences were evident at very low sequencing depths and were mostly caused by  the abundance of streptococcus mitis and gemella haemolysans in mucosa. in summary, we present an experimental and data analysis framework that will facilitate design and interpretation of pyrosequencing-based studies. despite challenges associated with this technique, we demonstrate its power for evaluation of oral diversity and biogeography patterns.

TI  == inflammation-hemostasis relationship in infected malnourished mice: modulatory effect of lactobacillus casei crl 431.
AB  == objective and design: the coagulation system is considered part of the defense machinery, but its excessive activation can lead to additional damage. we studied the effects of oral administration of lactobacillus casei crl 431--a probiotic bacterium--on the activation of coagulation and the relationship with inflammatory parameters during a respiratory infection in malnourished mice. materials and methods: malnourished swiss albino mice were nourished with a balanced commercial diet (bcd) for 7 days or bcd with l. casei for the last 2 days (bcd + lc). bcd, bcd + lc, malnourished (mnc) and well-nourished controls (wnc) were infected with streptococcus pneumoniae. blood and bronchoalveolar lavage samples were obtained at different times post-infection. results and conclusions: malnutrition altered most of the evaluated parameters before and after infection. the repletion diet with supplemental l. casei was the most effective in limiting coagulation activation and normalizing coagulation inhibition mechanisms. these findings will help develop further strategies to reduce the damaging effects of clotting and enhance its beneficial contribution to immune reactions.

TI  == antimicrobial properties and cytotoxicity of an antimicrobial monomer for application in prosthodontics.
AB  == purpose: this study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial properties and cytotoxicity of the monomer methacryloyloxyundecylpyridinium bromide (mupb), an antiseptic agent capable of copolymerizing with denture base acrylic resins. materials and methods: the antimicrobial activity of mupb was tested against the  species candida albicans, candida dubliniensis, candida glabrata, lactobacillus casei, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus mutans. the minimum inhibitory and fungicidal/bactericidal concentrations (mic, mfc/mbc) of mupb were determined by serial dilutions in comparison with cetylpyridinium chloride (cpc). the cytotoxic effects of mupb at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 1 g/l were assessed by mtt test on l929 cells and compared with methyl methacrylate (mma). the antimicrobial activity of copolymerized mupb was tested by means of acrylic resin specimens containing three concentrations of the monomer (0, 0.3, 0.6% w/w). activity was quantified by means of a disc diffusion test and a quantification of adhered planktonic cells. statistical analysis employed the mann-whitney test for mic and mfc/mbc, and anova for the microbial adherence test (alpha = 0.05). results: mubp presented lower mic values when compared with cpc,  although differences were significant for c. dubliniensis and s. mutans only (p=  0.046 and 0.043, respectively). mfc/mbc values were similar for all species except c. albicans; in that case, mupb presented significantly higher values (p = 0.046). mupb presented higher cytotoxicity than mma for all tested concentrations (p < 0.001) except at 0.01 g/l. irrespective of the concentration incorporated and species, there was no inhibition halo around the specimens. the incorporation of mupb influenced the adhesion of c. albicans only (p = 0.003), with lower cfu counts for the 0.6% group. conclusions: it was concluded that non-polymerized mupb has an antimicrobial capacity close to that of cpc and high cytotoxicity when compared with mma. the antimicrobial activity of mupb after incorporation within a denture base acrylic resin did not depend on its elution, but was shown  to be restricted to c. albicans.

TI  == effect of periodontal pathogens on the metatranscriptome of a healthy multispecies biofilm model.
AB  == oral bacterial biofilms are highly complex microbial communities with up to 700 different bacterial taxa. we report here the use of metatranscriptomic analysis to study patterns of community gene expression in a multispecies biofilm model composed of species found in healthy oral biofilms (actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula, and fusobacterium  nucleatum) and the same biofilm plus the periodontopathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the presence of the periodontopathogens altered patterns in gene expression, and data indicate that transcription of protein-encoding genes and small noncoding rnas is stimulated. in the healthy biofilm hypothetical proteins, transporters and transcriptional regulators were upregulated while chaperones and cell division proteins were downregulated. however, when the pathogens were present, chaperones were highly upregulated, probably due to increased levels of stress. we also observed a significant upregulation of abc transport systems and putative transposases. changes in clusters of orthologous groups functional categories as well as gene set enrichment analysis based on kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (kegg) pathways showed that in the absence of pathogens, only sets of proteins related to transport and secondary metabolism were upregulated, while in the presence of  pathogens, proteins related to growth and division as well as a large portion of  transcription factors were upregulated. finally, we identified several small noncoding rnas whose predicted targets were genes differentially expressed in the open reading frame libraries. these results show the importance of pathogens controlling gene expression of a healthy oral community and the usefulness of metatranscriptomic techniques to study gene expression profiles in complex microbial community models.

TI  == manufacture of fior di latte cheese by incorporation of probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == this work aimed to select heat-resistant probiotic lactobacilli to be added to fior di latte (high-moisture cow milk mozzarella) cheese. first, 18 probiotic strains belonging to lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus reuteri were screened. resistance to heating (65 or  55 degrees c for 10 min) varied markedly between strains. adaptation at 42 degrees c for 10 min increased the heat resistance at 55 degrees c for 10 min of  all probiotic lactobacilli. heat-adapted l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 (decimal reduction time at 55 degrees c of 227.4 min) and l. paracasei bgp1 (decimal reduction time at 55 degrees c of 40.8 min) showed the highest survival  under heat conditions that mimicked the stretching of the curd and were used for  the manufacture of fior di latte cheese. two technology options were chosen: chemical (addition of lactic acid to milk) or biological (streptococcus thermophilus as starter culture) acidification with or without addition of probiotics. as determined by random amplified polymorphic dna-pcr and 16s rrna gene analyses, the cell density of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 and l. paracasei bgp1 in chemically or biologically acidified fior di latte cheese was approximately 8.0 log(10)cfu/g. microbiological, compositional, biochemical, and  sensory analyses (panel test by 30 untrained judges) showed that the use of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 and l. paracasei bgp1 enhanced flavor formation and shelf-life of fior di latte cheeses.

TI  == the effect of microbial-nutrient interaction on the immune system of young chicks after early probiotic and organic acid administration.
AB  == the combined effects of probiotics (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, streptococcus faecium, and saccharomyces cerevisiae) and organic acids (sorbic and citric acid) on intestinal morphology and expression of immune-related genes were investigated. one-day-old chicks were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: birds not receiving probiotic or organic acids (control; t1), or birds receiving an oral combination (1 g/l in water) of 10(8) cfu/g of each of the aforementioned probiotics and organic acids (1% sorbic acid and 0.2% citric acid) for 7 (t2) or 14 d (t3). each group was divided into 5 replicate pens of 20 birds each, and 5 birds from each group (1 from each pen) were killed on d 11 and 22. intestinal sections were collected for histological assessment, and reverse transcriptase-pcr analysis was used to assess defensin and cathelicidins expression. quantitative real-time pcr was used to assess toll-like receptors (tlr) and cytokine expression. duodenal villus height was greater in t2 and t3 at d 11 (p </= 0.036) and 22 (p </= 0.015) compared with t1. at d 11, duodenal goblet cell/unit area was less in t3, whereas it was greater in t2 compared with  t1 in the jejunum (p = 0.009). ileal goblet cell/unit area was greater in t3 at d 22 compared with t1 (p < 0.001). avian beta-defensin-3 was expressed in all tissues except the bursa of t3 birds at d 11, and tlr-2 was down regulated in the cecal tonsil of birds in t2 and t3 at d 11 compared with t1 (p = 0.020 and 0.003, respectively). expression of il-12p35 in the ileum at d 11 was down regulated in  t2 and t3 compared with t1 (p = 0.030 and 0.012, respectively). reduced expression of inf-gamma was observed in the ileum in t3 compared with t1 at d 11  (p = 0.047). ileal il-6 and il-10 and cecal tonsil interferon-gamma (inf-gamma) expressions were greater t2 at d 22 (p </= 0.047) than t1. in conclusion, supplementation of combined probiotics and organic acids resulted in inconsistent gut morphology associated responses, and avian beta-defensins and cathelicidins expression were not associated with combined probiotics and organic acids supplementation. birds supplemented with combined probiotics and organic acids for 7 d showing similar responses in tlr-2, il-12p35, and ifn-gamma compared with those supplemented for 14 d indicates that shorter periods of supplementation might be enough to elicit beneficial responses.

TI  == the effect of a commercial probiotic drink on oral microbiota in healthy complete denture wearers.
AB  == background: it is acknowledged that oral and general health status declines with  age. the global population of denture wearers is increasing, so is the incidence  of denture biofilm-related problems, such as denture-associated stomatitis, aspiration pneumonia and malodour. it has been suggested that consumption of probiotic bacteria may improve oral health. however, the effects of probiotics on the oral microbiota of denture wearers have received little attention. methods: the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of consumption of a commercial probiotic product (yakult) on microbiota of saliva, tongue and denture biofilm in healthy complete denture wearers. eight healthy complete denture-wearing national health service (nhs) patients undertook a 7-week trial comprising three phases: baseline; 4-week consumption of one bottle of yakult per day, each containing a minimum 6.5x10(9) viable cells of lactobacillus casei strain shirota (lcs); 4-week washout period. the microbial viability and composition of saliva, tongue dorsum coating and denture biofilm were assessed using a range of solid selective and indicator media. questionnaires were used to explore participants' denture cleaning habits and impact of wearing dentures on their life quality and well-being [modified oral health impact profile (ohip-14)] prior to and after the study. results: seven volunteers (1 male, 6 females) completed the trial. lcs temporarily colonised oral cavity and denture surface. there was no significant change in the viability of streptococcus mutans, acidogenic microorganisms, total anaerobic species and gram-negative obligate anaerobes between study phases. there was no obvious effect of lcs on occurrence  and viability of candida. participants presented a good general knowledge of denture hygiene and their responses to ohip-14 questionnaires improved after completing the study (p=0.16). conclusion: it appeared that 4-week consumption of probiotic drink had no overall effect on selected oral parameters in healthy denture wearers despite temporary presence of lcs.

TI  == molecular detection of in-vivo microbial contamination of metallic orthodontic brackets by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == introduction: knowing the microbiota that colonizes orthodontic appliances is important for planning strategies and implementing specific preventive measures during treatment. the purpose of this clinical trial was to evaluate in vivo the  contamination of metallic orthodontic brackets with 40 dna probes for different bacterial species by using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cddh) technique. methods: eighteen patients, 11 to 29 years of age having fixed orthodontic treatment, were enrolled in the study. each subject had 2 new metallic brackets bonded to different premolars in a randomized manner. after 30  days, the brackets were removed and processed for analysis by cddh. data on bacterial contamination were analyzed descriptively and with the kruskal-wallis and dunn post tests (alpha = 0.05). forty microbial species (cariogenic microorganisms, bacteria of the purple, yellow, green, orange complexes, "red complex +treponema socranskii," and the cluster of actinomyces) were assessed. results: most bacterial species were present in all subjects, except for streptococcus constellatus, campylobacter rectus, tannerella forsythia, t socranskii, and lactobacillus acidophillus (94.4%), propionibacterium acnes i and eubacterium nodatum (88.9%), and treponema denticola (77.8%). among the cariogenic microorganisms, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus were found in larger numbers than l acidophillus and lactobacillus casei (p <0.001). the periodontal pathogens of the orange complex were detected in larger numbers than those of the "red complex +t socranskii" (p <0.0001). among the bacteria not associated with specific pathologies, veillonella parvula (purple complex) was the most frequently detected strain (p <0.0001). the numbers of yellow and green  complex bacteria and the cluster of actinomyces were similar (p >0.05). conclusions: metallic brackets in use for 1 month were multi-colonized by several bacterial species, including cariogenic microorganisms and periodontal pathogens, reinforcing the need for meticulous oral hygiene and additional preventive measures to maintain oral health in orthodontic patients.

TI  == the fate of indigenous microbiota, starter cultures, escherichia coli, listeria innocua and staphylococcus aureus in danish raw milk and cheeses determined by pyrosequencing and quantitative real time (qrt)-pcr.
AB  == the purpose of this work was to study the bacterial communities in raw milk and in danish raw milk cheeses using pyrosequencing of tagged amplicons of the v3 and v4 regions of the 16s rdna and cdna. furthermore, the effects of acidification and ripening starter cultures, cooking temperatures and rate of acidification on  survival of added escherichia coli, listeria innocua and staphylococcus aureus in cheeses at different stages of ripening were studied by pyrosequencing and quantitative real time (qrt)-pcr. a high diversity of bacterial species was detected in raw milk. lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus rhamnosus were the main bacteria detected in raw milk and cheeses. bacteria belonging to the genera brevibacterium, staphylococcus, escherichia, weissella, leuconostoc, pediococcus were also detected in both 16s rdna and cdna obtained from raw milk and cheeses. e. coli, which was added to milk used for production of some cheeses, was detected in both dna and rna extracted from cheeses at different stages of ripening showing the highest percentage of the total sequence reads at 7 days of ripening and decreased again in the later ripening stages. growth of e. coli in cheeses appeared to be affected by the cooking temperature and the rate of acidification  but not by the ripening starter cultures applied or the indigenous microbiota of  raw milk. growth of l. innocua and s. aureus added to milks was inhibited in all  cheeses at different stages of ripening. the use of 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing  and qrt-pcr allows a deeper understanding of the behavior of indigenous microbiota, starter cultures and pathogenic bacteria in raw milk and cheeses.

TI  == community-based interference against integration of pseudomonas aeruginosa into human salivary microbial biofilm.
AB  == as part of the human gastrointestinal tract, the oral cavity represents a complex biological system and harbors diverse bacterial species. unlike the gut microbiota, which is often considered a health asset, studies of the oral commensal microbiota have been largely limited to their implication in oral conditions such as dental caries and periodontal disease. less emphasis has been  given to their potential beneficial roles, especially the protective effects against oral colonization by foreign or pathogenic bacteria. in this study, we used salivary microbiota derived from healthy human subjects to investigate protective effects against colonization and integration of pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic bacterial pathogen, into developing or pre-formed salivary biofilms. when co-cultivated in saliva medium, p. aeruginosa persisted in the planktonic phase, but failed to integrate into the salivary microbial community during biofilm formation. furthermore, in saliva medium supplemented with sucrose, the oral microbiota inhibited the growth of p. aeruginosa by producing lactic acid. more interestingly, while pre-formed salivary biofilms were able to prevent p. aeruginosa colonization, the same biofilms recovered from mild chlorhexidine gluconate treatment displayed a shift in microbial composition and showed a drastic reduction in protection. our study indicates that normal oral communities with balanced microbial compositions could be important in effectively preventing the integration of foreign or pathogenic bacterial species, such as p. aeruginosa.

TI  == probiotics for prevention and treatment of diarrhea.
AB  == probiotics have been extensively studied over the past several years in the prevention and, to a larger extent, in the treatment of diarrheal diseases, especially in pediatric populations. diarrhea is a symptom, and not a disease. this review will not address chronic disorders associated with diarrhea, or clostridium difficile-induced diarrhea. rather it will focus on published clinical trials performed on acute-onset, likely infectious diarrhea occurring in the settings of day-care centers, in the community, acquired in the hospital, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and treatment of acute infectious diarrhea. for prevention of diarrhea acquired in day-care centers, 9 randomized and placebo-controlled trials have been published, conducted in different parts of the world. probiotics tested were lactobacillus gg, bifidobacterium lactis (alone or in combination with streptococcus thermophilus, and lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus (not gg), and lactobacillus acidophilus, in various trials either alone or in comparison with each other. the evidence of their efficacy in these settings is only modest for the prevention of diarrhea, although somewhat better for prevention of upper respiratory infections. in the community, new trails conducted in underprivileged areas of india, again with modest efficacy. previous trials that examined the potential role of probiotics in preventing the spreading of diarrhea in hospitalized children had yielded conflicting results. more recently, a large trial in poland showed, however, rather good evidence of efficacy for lactobacillus gg. the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea has been the subject of many investigations, both  in children and in adults. most commonly used probiotics were lactobacillus gg, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium ssp, streptococcus ssp, and the yeast saccharomyces boulardii. in general, most of these trials do show clear evidence of efficacy, with the 2 most effective strains being lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii. evidence is also emerging on the importance of the dose in reducing the incidence of this type of diarrhea, and the incidence of clostridium difficile-associated postantibiotic diarrhea. as for treatment, a large body of data is available, especially in children, on the effect of several strains of probiotics in treating sporadic infectious diarrhea. the vast majority of the published trials show a statistically significant benefit and moderate clinical benefit of a few, well-identified probiotic strains-mostly lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii-in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea, and particularly those due to rotavirus. such a beneficial effect results, on average, in a reduction of diarrhea duration of approximately 1 day.  the effect is strain-dependent and dose-dependent.

TI  == host immunity in the protective response to nasal immunization with a pneumococcal antigen associated to live and heat-killed lactobacillus casei.
AB  == background: at present, available pneumococcal vaccines have failed to eradicate  infections caused by s. pneumoniae. search for effective vaccine continues and some serotype independent pneumococcal proteins are considered as candidates for  the design of new vaccines, especially a mucosal vaccine, since pneumococci enter the body through mucosal surfaces. selection of the appropriate adjuvant is important for mucosal vaccines, and lactic acid bacteria (lab) with immunostimulant properties are promissory candidates. in this work, we assessed the adjuvant effect of a probiotic strain, lactobacillus casei (l. casei), when nasally administered with a pneumococcal antigen (pneumococcal protective protein a: pppa) for the prevention of pneumococcal infection. adjuvanticity of both live (lcv) and heat-killed (lcm) was evaluated and humoral and cellular antigen-specific immune response was assessed in mucosal and systemic compartments. the potential mechanisms induced by nasal immunization were discussed. results: nasal immunization of young mice with pppa+lcv and pppa+lcm induced anti-pppa iga and igg antibodies in mucosal and systemic compartments and levels of these specific antibodies remained high even at day 45 after the 3rd immunization (3rd i). these results were correlated with il-4 induction by the mixture of antigen plus lcv and lcm. also, pppa+lc (v and m) induced stimulation  of th1 and th17 cells involved in the defence against pneumococci. the protection against pneumococcal respiratory challenge at day 30 after the 3rd i showed that  pppa+lcv and pppa+lcm immunizations significantly reduced pathogen counts in nasal lavages while prventing their passage into lung and blood. survival of mice immunized with the co-application of pppa plus lcv and lcm was significantly higher than in mice immunized with pppa alone and control mice when intraperitoneal challenge was performed. no significant differences between the treatments involving lcv and lcm were found. conclusions: live and heat-killed l. casei enhanced the antigen-specific immune response when administered nasally with a pneumococcal antigen. considering the potential risk associated with live  bacteria, the design of a nasal vaccine based on pneumococcal antigens and heat-killed l. casei emerges as a safe and effective strategy for the prevention  of pneumococcal infections and opens new possibilities of application of dead lab as adjuvants in vaccine formulations against other pathogens.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of nanoemulsion on cariogenic planktonic and biofilm organisms.
AB  == introduction: nanoemulsions (ne) are a unique class of disinfectants produced by  mixing a water immiscible liquid phase into an aqueous phase under high shear forces. ne have antimicrobial properties and are also effective anti-biofilm agents. materials and methods: the effectiveness of nanoemulsion and its components was determined against streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus casei by live/dead staining. in vitro antimicrobial effectiveness of nanoemulsion against  planktonic s. mutans, l. casei, actinomyces viscosus, candida albicans and mixed  culture was determined by a serial dilution technique to obtain minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration (mic/mbc). in addition, efficacy was investigated by kinetics of killing, adherence and biofilm assays. results: compared to its components, nanoemulsion showed notable antimicrobial activity against biofilm organisms, up to 83.0% kill within 1min. ne dilutions ranging from 243 to 19683 were effective against planktonic s. mutans, l. casei, a. viscosus, c. albicans and mixed culture of these four strains as shown through mic/mbc assays. ne showed antimicrobial activity against planktonic cells at high dilutions, confirmed by time kill studies. the level of  adhesion on glass surface was reduced by 94.2-99.5% in nanoemulsion treated groups (p<0.001). 4-day-old s. mutans, l. casei, a. viscosus, c. albicans and mixed cultures biofilms treated with ne showed reductions of bacterial counts with decreasing dilutions (p<0.001). conclusion: these results suggest that nanoemulsion has effective anti-cariogenic activity against cariogenic microorganisms and may be a useful medication in the prevention of caries.

AB  == the up- and downstream regions of ctl1 and ctl2 that encode a cystathionine lyase were analyzed in various lactobacillus casei strains. ctl1 and ctl2 were found to be part of a gene cluster encoding two other open reading frames. one of the two  open reading frames precedes ctl1 and encodes a putative cysteine synthase. the other open reading frame lies downstream of ctl1 and encodes a putative serine acetyltransferase. the gene cluster is not present in the publicly available genome sequences of l. casei atcc 334, bl23 and zhang. apparently, the gene cluster was acquired by a horizontal gene transfer event and can also be found in other lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus. rt-pcr was used to  analyze the expression of the gene cluster. additionally, an mass spectrometry-based selected reaction monitoring method was developed for quantifying ctl1 in a cell-free extract of lactic acid bacteria. the gene cluster cysk2-ctl1-cyse2 was expressed as single transcript, and expression was down-regulated by cysteine. in addition, cystathionine lyase activity present in  cell-free extracts disappeared when l. casei was grown in the presence of cysteine. whereas the transcript and the gene product of ctl1 protein were found  in all studied ctl1(+)l. casei strains, only the transcript but not the protein or cystathionine lyase activity was detected in l. helveticus fam2888, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus atcc 11842 and s. thermophilus fam17014, which actually possess a homolog of the cysk2-ctl1-cyse2 gene cluster.

TI  == bioconversion of ovine scotta into lactic acid with pure and mixed cultures of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == scotta is the main by-product in the making of ricotta cheese. it is widely produced in southern europe and particularly in italy where it represents a serious environmental pollutant due to its high lactose content. with the aim of  evaluating whether scotta bioconversion into lactic acid can be considered as an  alternative to its disposal, besides providing it with an added value, here the growth, fermentative performances, and lactic acid productions of pure and mixed  cultures of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus were evaluated on ovine scotta-based media, without and with the addition of nutritional supplements. the outcomes indicate that ovine scotta can  be utilized for the biotechnological production of lactic acid with yields up to  92%, comparable to those obtained on cheese-whey. indeed, the addition of nutritional supplements generally improves the fermentative performances of lactic acid bacteria leading to about 2 g l(-1) h(-1) of lactic acid. moreover, the use of mixed cultures for scotta bioconversion reduces the need for nutritional supplements, with no detrimental effects on the productive parameters compared to pure cultures. finally, by using l. casei and s. thermophilus in pure and mixed cultures, up to 99% optically pure l: -lactic acid can be obtained.

TI  == oral microflora in infants delivered vaginally and by caesarean section.
AB  == background. early in life, vaginally delivered infants exhibit a different composition of the gut flora compared with infants delivered by caesarean section (c-section); however, it is unclear whether this also applies to the oral cavity. aim. to investigate and compare the oral microbial profile between infants delivered vaginally and by c-section. design. this is a cross-sectional case-control study. eighty-four infants delivered either vaginally (n = 42) or by c-section (n = 42) were randomly selected from the 2009 birth cohort at the county hospital in halmstad, sweden. medically compromised and premature children (<32 weeks) were excluded. the mean age was 8.25 months (range 6-10 months), and  parents were asked to complete a questionnaire on socioeconomic factors, lifestyle, and hygiene habits. saliva was collected and analysed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results. a higher prevalence of salivary streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus curvata, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacuillus casei was detected in infants delivered vaginally (p < 0.05). the  caries-associated bacteria streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus were detected in 63% and 59% of all children, respectively. conclusion. a significantly higher prevalence of certain strains of health-related streptococci and lactobacilli was found in vaginally delivered infants compared with infants delivered by c-section. the possible long-term effects on oral health need to be  further investigated.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in mongolia.
AB  == spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in mongolia. the lab counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/ml. fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of lab, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. in total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. each isolate was considered to be presumptive lab based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  multiplex pcr assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. all isolates from mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), enterococcus durans (3 strains), lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), lactobacillus casei (16 strains), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and weissella cibaria (1 strain). the predominant lab were strep. thermophilus and lb. helveticus, which were isolated  from all sampling sites. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of mongolia have complex compositions of lab species. such diversity of lab provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.

TI  == typing of bacteriophages by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr to assess genetic diversity.
AB  == the recent boom in phage therapy and phage biocontrol requires the design of suitable cocktails of genetically different bacteriophages. the current methods for typing phages need significant quantities of purified dna, may require a priori genetic information and are cost and time consuming. we have evaluated the randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr technique to produce unique and reproducible band patterns from 26 different bacteriophages infecting staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, lactococcus lactis, escherichia coli, streptococcus thermophilus, bacillus subtilis and lactobacillus casei bacterial strains. initially, purified dna and phage suspensions of seven selected phages were used as a template. the conditions that were found to be optimal 8 mum of 10-mer primers, 3 mum magnesium oxalacetate and 5% dimethyl sulfoxide. the rapd genomic fingerprints using a phage titer suspension higher than 10(9) pfu ml(-1) were highly reproducible. clustering by the pearson correlation coefficient and the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages clustering algorithm correlated largely with genetically different phages infecting the same bacterial species, although closely related phages with a similar dna restriction pattern were indistinguishable. the results support the use of rapd-pcr for quick typing of phage isolates and preliminary assessment of  their genetic diversity bypassing tedious dna purification protocols and previous knowledge of their sequence.

TI  == use of the checkerboard dna-dna hybridisation technique for in vivo detection of  cariogenic microorganisms on metallic brackets, with or without use of an antimicrobial agent.
AB  == objective: using checkerboard dna-dna hybridisation (cddh) assay, this randomised clinical study evaluated the contamination of metallic brackets by four cariogenic bacterial strains (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus acidophilus) and the efficacy of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate (chx) mouthwashes in reducing bacterial contamination. methods: thirty-nine 11-33-year-old patients under treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances were enrolled in the study and had 2 new metallic brackets bonded to premolars. nineteen patients used a 0.12% chx mouthwash (periogard) and 20 patients used a placebo mouthwash (control) twice a week. after 30 days, the brackets were removed and samples were obtained for analysis by cddh. data were analysed statistically by the kruskal-wallis test (alpha=0.05) using the sas software. results: s. mutans, s. sobrinus, l. casei and l. acidophilus were detected in 100% of the samples from both groups. however, brackets of the control group were more heavily contaminated by s. mutans and s. sobrinus (p<0.01). in the experimental group, although all counts decreased after rinsing  with the chlorhexidine solution, there was significant difference only for s. mutans (p=0.03). conclusions: the use of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwashes can be useful in clinical practice to reduce the levels of cariogenic microorganisms in patients under treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances.

TI  == nasal immunization of mice with lactobacillus casei expressing the pneumococcal surface protein c primes the immune system and decreases pneumococcal nasopharyngeal colonization in mice.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae colonizes the upper respiratory tract of healthy individuals, from where it can be transmitted to the community. occasionally, bacteria invade sterile niches, causing diseases. the pneumococcal surface protein c (pspc) is a virulence factor that is important during colonization and  the systemic phases of the diseases. here, we have evaluated the effect of nasal  or sublingual immunization of mice with lactobacillus casei expressing pspc, as well as prime-boosting protocols using recombinant pspc, on nasopharyngeal pneumococcal colonization. none of the protocols tested was able to elicit significant levels of anti-pspc antibodies before challenge. however, a significant decrease in pneumococcal recovery from the nasopharynx was observed in animals immunized through the nasal route with l. casei-pspc. immune responses evaluated after colonization challenge in this group of mice were characterized by an increase in mucosal anti-pspc immunoglobulin a (iga) 5 days later, a time point in which the pneumococcal loads were already low. a negative correlation between the concentrations of anti-pspc iga and pneumococcal recovery from the nasopharynx was observed, with animals with the lowest colonization levels having higher iga concentrations. these results show that nasal immunization with l. casei-pspc primes the immune system of mice, prompting faster immune responses that result in a decrease in pneumococcal colonization.

TI  == development and evaluation of a safe and effective sugar-free herbal lollipop that kills cavity-causing bacteria.
AB  == dental caries (tooth decay) is caused by a specific group of cariogenic bacteria, like streptococcus mutans, which convert dietary sugars into acids that dissolve  the mineral in tooth structure. killing cariogenic bacteria is an effective way to control or prevent tooth decay. in a previous study, we discovered a novel compound (glycyrrhizol a), from the extraction of licorice roots, with strong antimicrobial activity against cariogenic bacteria. in the current study, we developed a method to produce these specific herbal extracts in large quantities, and then used these extracts to develop a sugar-free lollipop that effectively kills cariogenic bacteria like streptococcus mutans. further studies showed that  these sugar-free lollipops are safe and their antimicrobial activity is stable. two pilot human studies indicate that a brief application of these lollipops (twice a day for ten days) led to a marked reduction of cariogenic bacteria in oral cavity among most human subjects tested. this herbal lollipop could be a novel tool to promote oral health through functional foods.

TI  == evaluating the in-vitro antibacterial effect of iranian propolis on oral microorganisms.
AB  == propolis has traditionally been used in curing infections and healing wounds and  burns. current researches have shown that propolis has antibacterial, antifungal  and antiviral actions however, the pharmacological activity of propolis is highly variable depending on its geographic origin. there have been few studies on the effects of iranian propolis on the oral microorganisms. in this in-vitro study, the antimicrobial activity of the ethanolic and water extracts of the iranian propolis (10%, w/v) from north-east area of tehran was evaluated. susceptibility  of the oral strains tested (streptococcus mutans atcc 35668; streptococcus salivarius atcc 9222; staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis atcc 9854 and lactobacillus casei atcc 39392) was evaluated using the agar diffusion method at a concentration of 20 mg/ml of propolis and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. antibacterial activity was determined by using minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) at different concentrations of propolis. the ethanolic extract showed bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity against all the strains, with mic and mbc ranges of 250-500 microg/ml. the mic concentration of the water extract was 500 microg/ml against s. mutans and e. faecalis. the water extract showed bactericidal activity only against s. mutans (20 mg/ml). these results indicate that the ethanolic extract is probably more useful in the control of oral biofilms and subsequent dental caries development. however, to determine the consequence of the ethanolic extract of iranian propolis on the oral mucosa, in-vivo studies of its possible effects are needed.

TI  == [comparative clinical efficacy of a probiotic vs. an antibiotic in the treatment  of patients with intestinal bacterial overgrowth and chronic abdominal functional distension: a pilot study].
AB  == introduction: patients with intestinal bacterial overgrowth (sibo) are usually treated with different antibiotics. certain probiotics have proved to be clinically effective in patients with abdominal distension. objective: to compare the short-term clinical efficacy of metronidazol vs. a probiotic in patients with sibo and functional chronic abdominal distension. patients and methods. this was  a randomized prospective pilot study. the study population consisted of 50 patients with chronic abdominal distension (rome iii criteria) and diagnosis of sibo made by a lactulose h2 breath test. patients were consecutively randomized to receive either metronidazol or a probiotic. the metronidazol group consisted of 25 subjects (23 women, median age 49 +/- 19 years old), who received metronidazol (flagyl), 500 mg bid for 5 days. the probiotic group consisted of 25 subjects (20 women, median age 58 +/- 19 years old). the probiotic administered to the latter group contained lactobacillus casei (3.3 x 10(7) ufc), lactobacillus plantarum (3.3 x 10(7) ufc), streptococcus faecalis (3.3 x 10(7) ufc) and bifidobacterium brevis (1.0 x 10(6) ufc) (bioflora) and 5 ml bid were administered for 5 days. both groups went on the same diet, which consisted in reduced consumption of alcohol, legumes, dairy products and leafy green vegetables. response to treatment was assessed by an independent questioner 15 days post treatment. a five-level overall response questionnaire was used. responses included much better, better, the same, worse, and much worse. better and much better were considered positive responses. results: thirteen (52%) subjects receiving metronidazol and 20 (82%) receiving the probiotic referred clinical improvement after the treatment. a statistically significant difference  favoured the use of the probiotic (p = 0.036). all the study patients completed treatment. no adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were observed.  conclusions: based on this pilot study results, we can suggest that the probiotic herein used has a higher efficacy than metronidazol in the early clinical response of patients with chronic abdominal distension and sibo.

TI  == the antibacterial effect of gas ozone after 2 months of in vitro evaluation.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of healozone on two microorganisms, 4 and 8 weeks after treatment, using a tooth cavity model. four groups of caries-free third molars (n = 12) were used (a, b, c and d). three cavities were prepared into each tooth. after sterilization, groups a and b were  inoculated with streptococcus mutans, and groups c and d, with lactobacillus casei for 48 h. one cavity of each tooth was used to evaluate the infection. after inoculation, groups b and d were treated with ozone (60 s), and groups a and c were used as controls. then, the two cavities of each tooth were filled with composite, and the teeth were stored in sucrose medium. the restorations were removed after 4 and 8 weeks, respectively; dentin chips were collected, and  the amount of microorganisms was determined. ozone treatment reduced significantly the amount of s. mutans compared to the control group (p </= 0.05). this antibacterial effect was able to be seen after 4 (p = 0.0005) and 8 (p = 0.0002) weeks. no significant difference was found between the control and treated group as far as l. casei is concerned (p > 0.05). healozone (60 s) can provide some antibacterial treatment against s. mutans even after 8 weeks. however, an elimination of the microorganisms through healozone seems not to be possible. l. casei was more resistant to ozone. although ozone exerts a significant antibacterial effect against s. mutans, it is probably not enough as  the only antibacterial method, during the fillings therapy.

TI  == probiotic assessment of enterococcus faecalis cp58 isolated from human gut.
AB  == a total of seventy lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from the faeces of healthy humans and their identities were confirmed by sequencing of their 16s rdna genes. of these only 5 isolates were found to resist bile salts and indicated survival in the simulated in vitro digestion assay which reproduces the stomach and intestinal digestion indicating their tolerance to gastric enzymes and the low ph conditions. species that showed the best resistance to these conditions were: lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus sp., uncultured bifidobacteria, enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus anginosus. these strains  were investigated further to study their capacity to adhere to human intestinal caco-2 cells. e. faecalis was the most adherent strain. examination of the virulence determinants for this strain indicated that it was positive for efaafs, gele, agg, cpd, cob, ccf and cad, a profile that is similar to that of many e. faecalis isolates from food sources. the cytolysin biosynthetic genes cyla, cylb  and cylm that are more associated with the clinical isolates of e. faecium were not detected in this strain. the antibiotic susceptibility tests indicated that the strain was sensitive to vancomycin, tetracycline, rifampicin and erythromycin but resistant only to kanamycin and chloramphenicol. these data suggest that the  strain e. faecalis cp58 may be tested further for beneficial properties and developed as a new probiotic.

TI  == comparison of culture-dependent and -independent methods for bacterial community  monitoring during montasio cheese manufacturing.
AB  == the microbial community in milk is of great importance in the manufacture of traditional cheeses produced using raw milk and natural cultures. during milk curdling and cheese ripening, complex interactions occur in the microbial community, and accurate identification of the microorganisms involved provides essential information for understanding their role in these processes and in flavor production. recent improvements in molecular biological methods have led to their application to food matrices, and thereby opened new perspectives for the study of microbial communities in fermented foods. in this study, a description of microbial community composition during the manufacture and ripening of montasio cheese was provided. a combined approach using culture-dependent and -independent methods was applied. culture-dependent identification was compared with 16s clone libraries sequencing data obtained from both dna and reverse-transcribed rna (cdna) amplification and real-time quantitative pcr (qpcr) assays developed to detect and quantify specific bacterial species/genera (streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei, pediococcus pentosaceus, enterococcus spp., pseudomonas spp.). s. thermophilus was the predominant lab species throughout the entire ripening period of montasio cheese. the culture-independent method demonstrates the relevant presence of pseudomonas spp. and lactococcus piscium at the beginning of ripening. the culture-dependent approach and the two culture-independent approaches produced complementary information, together generating a general view of cheese microbial ecology.

TI  == phylogenetic group- and species-specific oligonucleotide probes for single-cell detection of lactic acid bacteria in oral biofilms.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to design and evaluate fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) probes for the single-cell detection and enumeration of lactic acid bacteria, in particular organisms belonging to the major phylogenetic groups and species of oral lactobacilli and to abiotrophia/granulicatella. results: as lactobacilli are known for notorious resistance to probe penetration, probe-specific assay protocols were experimentally developed to provide maximum cell wall permeability, probe accessibility, hybridization stringency, and fluorescence intensity. the new assays were then applied in a pilot study to three biofilm samples harvested from variably demineralized bovine enamel discs that had been carried in situ for 10 days by different volunteers. best probe penetration and fluorescent labeling of reference strains were obtained after combined lysozyme and achromopeptidase treatment followed by exposure to lipase.  hybridization stringency had to be established strictly for each probe. thereafter all probes showed the expected specificity with reference strains and  labeled the anticipated morphotypes in dental plaques. applied to in situ grown biofilms the set of probes detected only lactobacillus fermentum and bacteria of  the lactobacillus casei group. the most cariogenic biofilm contained two orders of magnitude higher l. fermentum cell numbers than the other biofilms. abiotrophia/granulicatella and streptococci from the mitis group were found in all samples at high levels, whereas streptococcus mutans was detected in only one sample in very low numbers. conclusions: application of these new group- and species-specific fish probes to oral biofilm-forming lactic acid bacteria will allow a clearer understanding of the supragingival biome, its spatial architecture and of structure-function relationships implicated during plaque homeostasis and caries development. the probes should prove of value far beyond the field of oral microbiology, as many of them detect non-oral species and phylogenetic groups of importance in a variety of medical conditions and the food industry.

AB  == in the present work, the anticariogenic activities of three pimarane-type diterpenes obtained by fungal biotransformation were investigated. among these metabolites, ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol was the most active compound, displaying very promising mic values (ranging from 1.5 to 4.0 mug ml(-1)) against the main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: streptococcus salivarius,  s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, and lactobacillus casei. time kill assays performed with ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol against the primary causative agent s. mutans revealed that this compound only avoids growth of the inoculum in the first 12 h (bacteriostatic effect). however, its bactericidal effect is clearly noted thereafter (between 12 and 24 h). the curve profile obtained by combining ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol and chlorhexidine revealed a  significant reduction in the time necessary for killing s. mutans compared with each of these two chemicals alone. however, no synergistic effect was observed using the same combination in the checkerboard assays against this microorganism. in conclusion, our results point out that ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol is an important metabolite in the search for new effective anticariogenic agents.

TI  == ftir-based polyphasic identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional greek graviera cheese.
AB  == this study used a combination of phenotypic, physical (fourier transformed infra-red [ftir] spectroscopy) and molecular (rflp and sscp analysis of 16s rrna  genes) methods to identify the lactic acid bacteria (lab) flora present in traditional greek graviera cheese after five weeks of ripening. a total of 300 isolates collected from high dilution plates of tsaye (incubated at 30 degrees c), m-17 (22 degrees c) and m-17 (42 degrees c) agar media were clustered by ftir and then representative strains of each cluster were cross-identified blindly by  all methods. based on their ftir spectra, 282 isolates were lab grouped in 28 clusters. the lab species identified and their prevalence in the cheese samples were: lactobacillus casei/paracasei (68.8%), lactobacillus plantarum (19.5%), streptococcus thermophilus (8.9%), enterococcus faecium (2.1%), and lactococcus lactis (0.7%). also, staphylococcus equorum (11 isolates), corynebacterium sp. (5 isolates) and brevibacterium sp. (1 isolate) were recovered from tsaye. comparative identification results showed that phenotypic and molecular methods were in mutual agreement as regards the lab species identified. the present polyphasic identification approach based on rapid ftir screening of 10-fold more  isolates than a previous classical identification approach allowed or improved detection of few sub-dominant species; however the predominant lab species in the cheese samples were the same with both approaches.

TI  == two strains of nonstarter lactobacilli increased the production of flavor compounds in soft cheeses.
AB  == the contribution to flavor generation and secondary proteolysis of 2 strains of mesophilic lactobacilli isolated from cheese was studied. miniature soft cheeses  (200 g) were produced with or without the inclusion of a culture of lactobacillus plantarum i91 or lactobacillus casei i90 in the starter composed of streptococcus thermophilus. during ripening, cheeses containing the added lactobacilli showed an increased content of total free amino acids, but this increase was only significant in cheeses with lb. plantarum i91. in addition, free amino acid profiles were modified by selective increases of some amino acids, such as asp, ser, arg, leu, and phe. cheeses inoculated with lb. plantarum i91 or lb. casei i90 were also characterized by a significantly higher concentration of diacetyl,  a key flavor compound, and an increased content of acetoin. results suggest an increase in the catabolism of either citrate or aspartate, with the production of the derived aroma compounds. overall, aspartate content increased in both lactobacilli-added cheeses, whereas citrate was more or less constant, suggesting that aspartate could be the source of increased diacetyl and acetoin. a triangle  aroma test showed that the addition of the lactobacilli strains significantly changed the sensory attributes of cheeses. at least 11 of 12 panelists commented  that the aroma of cheeses with adjuncts was more buttery than that of control cheeses, which is desirable in most soft cheeses. both lb. plantarum i91 and lb.  casei i90 performed well as adjunct cultures by influencing cheese aroma development and cheese proteolysis.

TI  == microbial diversity, dynamics and activity throughout manufacturing and ripening  of castelmagno pdo cheese.
AB  == the diversity, dynamics and activity of castelmagno pdo cheese microbiota were studied in three batches produced in a floor valley farm, in the grana valley (northwest italy), during the wintertime. samples of milk, curd and cheese (core  and subsurface) at different ripening time were submitted to both culture-dependent and -independent analysis. in particular, dna and rna directly  extracted from the matrices were studied by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and reverse transcription (rt)-pcr-dgge. culture-dependent methods highlighted the initial dominance of a thermophilic streptococcal population with the species streptococcus thermophilus and s. agalactiae. then, mesophilic lactococci occurred among isolates during manufacturing, with lactococcus lactis which was also well represented in the first month of castelmagno pdo ripening. at this point and throughout the ripening, lactobacilli prevailed in cheese samples, represented from lactobacillus plantarum and lb. casei. culture-independent analysis underlined the undoubted role of l. lactis, actively involved in both castelmagno pdo manufacturing and ripening. despite lb. helveticus was never isolated on selective media, a dgge band referred to this microorganism was detected, at rna level, in samples from ripened cheeses. on the other hand, lb. plantarum was widely isolated from the plates, among lactobacilli, but never detected by direct analysis. due to the importance of microbiota in the sensory richness and properties of traditional cheeses, new information have been added, in this work, on microbial diversity of castelmagno  pdo cheese.

TI  == antibacterial activity of a triclosan-containing resin composite matrix against three common oral bacteria.
AB  == this study investigated the antibacterial effect of a resin composite matrix with or without incorporated triclosan (0.3 wt%) on streptococcus mutans, actinomyces  viscosus and lactobacillus casei. in the quantitative assay, bacterial suspensions were filled into 20-mul cavities within temporary restorative resins. after 0, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h of incubation, the suspensions were removed from the restoratives and the numbers of viable bacteria were determined. bacterial suspensions incubated without restoratives served as the controls. ten replicates were carried out for each experiment. the resin composite containing triclosan demonstrated variable degrees of antibacterial activity against the microorganisms, revealing a significant inhibitory effect on s. mutans within 12  h compared to the control. the viable counts of a. viscosus significantly decreased after 24 h. a significant reduction of l. casei was observed after 48 h. the unloaded resin composite did not reveal a marked antibacterial effect. the resin composite loaded with triclosan might be beneficial in preventing cavity contamination and minimizing the risk of pulpal irritation in the short-term.

TI  == microbial stability and safety of traditional greek graviera cheese: characterization of the lactic acid bacterial flora and culture-independent detection of bacteriocin genes in the ripened cheeses and their microbial consortia.
AB  == the microflora of four batches of traditional greek graviera cheese was studied at 5 weeks of ripening, and 200 lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolates were phenotypically characterized and screened for antilisterial bacteriocins. the cheeses were also analyzed for organic acids by high-performance liquid chromatography and for the potential presence of 25 known lab bacteriocin genes directly in cheese and their microbial consortia by pcr. all batches were safe according to the european union regulatory criteria for listeria monocytogenes, salmonella, enterobacteria, and coagulase-positive staphylococci. the cheese flora was dominated by nonstarter lactobacillus casei/paracasei (67.5%) and lactobacillus plantarum (16.3%) strains, whereas few streptococcus thermophilus (3.8%), lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (0.6%), and leuconostoc (1.9%) organisms were present. enterococcus faecium (9.4%) and enterococcus durans (0.6%) were isolated among the dominant lab from two batches; however, enterococci were present in all batches at 10- to 100-fold lower populations than mesophilic lactobacilli. sixteen e. faecium isolates produced antilisterial enterocins. in accordance, enterocin b gene was detectable in all cheeses and enterocin p gene was present in one cheese, whereas the consortia of all cheeses contained at least two of the enterocin a, b, p, 31, l50a, and l50b genes. plantaricin a gene  was also amplified from all cheeses. mean concentrations of lactic, acetic, citric, and propionic acids in the ripened cheeses exceeded 1.5% in total, of which approximately 0.9% was lactate. thus, organic acid contents constitute an important hurdle factor for inhibiting growth of pathogens in traditional graviera cheese products, with lab bacteriocins, mainly enterocins, potentially contributing to increased cheese safety.

TI  == anti-cariogenic effect of a cetylpyridinium chloride-containing nanoemulsion.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this pilot study was to investigate the anticaries activity of a nanoemulsion composed of soybean oil, water, triton x-100 and cetylpyridinium chloride. methods: tooth blocks (3 mm length x 3 mm width x 2 mm  thickness) were cut from smooth surfaces of selected molar teeth using a water-cooled diamond wire saw. the blocks were randomly assigned to three experimental groups: (a) nanoemulsion, (b) 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate, and (c) no treatment. the formation of dental caries in human tooth enamel was tested using a continuous flow dual-organism (streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus casei), biofilm model, which acts as an artificial mouth and simulates the biological and physiological activities observed within the oral environment. experimental groups a and b were treated with their respective solutions once daily for 30 s on each occasion, while group c received no treatment. 10% sucrose was supplied every 6 h for 6 min to simulate meals and ph cycling. the experiment lasted for 5 days, and the tooth blocks were harvested and processed for demineralization assessment using transverse microradiography (tmr). results: for both lesion depth and mineral loss, statistical analysis indicated that emulsion  was significantly lower than control and chlorhexidine, and chlorhexidine was significantly lower than control. conclusions: we conclude that cetylpyridinium-containing nanoemulsions appear to present a feasible means of preventing the occurrence of early caries.

TI  == biofilm formation and virulence expression by streptococcus mutans are altered when grown in dual-species model.
AB  == background: microbial cell-cell interactions in the oral flora are believed to play an integral role in the development of dental plaque and ultimately, its pathogenicity. the effects of other species of oral bacteria on biofilm formation and virulence gene expression by streptococcus mutans, the primary etiologic agent of dental caries, were evaluated using a dual-species biofilm model and realtime-pcr analysis. results: as compared to mono-species biofilms, biofilm formation by s. mutans was significantly decreased when grown with streptococcus  sanguinis, but was modestly increased when co-cultivated with lactobacillus casei. co-cultivation with s. mutans significantly enhanced biofilm formation by  streptococcus oralis and l. casei, as compared to the respective mono-species biofilms. realtime-pcr analysis showed that expression of spap (for multi-functional adhesin spap, a surface-associated protein that s. mutans uses to bind to the tooth surface in the absence of sucrose), gtfb (for glucosyltransferase b that synthesizes alpha1,6-linked glucan polymers from sucrose and starch carbohydrates) and gbpb (for surface-associated protein gbpb,  which binds to the glucan polymers) was decreased significantly when s. mutans were co-cultivated with l. casei. similar results were also found with expression of spap and gbpb, but not gtfb, when s. mutans was grown in biofilms with s. oralis. compared to mono-species biofilms, the expression of luxs in s. mutans co-cultivated with s. oralis or l. casei was also significantly decreased. no significant differences were observed in expression of the selected genes when s. mutans was co-cultivated with s. sanguinis. conclusions: these results suggest that the presence of specific oral bacteria differentially affects biofilm formation and virulence gene expression by s. mutans.

TI  == characterization of a novel lysm domain from lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage endolysin and its use as an anchor to display heterologous proteins on the surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the endolysin lyb5, from lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phipyb5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria. sequence analysis revealed that the c terminus of the endolysin lyb5 (ly5c) contained three putative lysin motif (lysm) repeat regions, implying that  ly5c was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. to investigate the potential of ly5c for surface display, green fluorescent protein (gfp) was fused to ly5c at its n or c terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in escherichia coli. after being mixed with various cells in vitro, gfp was successfully displayed on the surfaces of lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus casei, lb. brevis, lb. plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lb. helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus cells. increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated l. lactis and lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for ly5c. moreover, the ph and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of gfp-ly5c, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. all results suggested that ly5c was  a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (lab). to demonstrate the applicability of the ly5c-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) from paenibacillus sp. strain k1, replacing gfp, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of lab cells via ly5c. the success in surface display of gfp and beta-gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in  lab.

AB  == aims: to test whether a single vector, nisin-controlled expression (nice) system  could be used to regulate expression of the pediocin operon in streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and lactobacillus casei. methods and results: the intact pediocin operon was cloned immediately into pmsp3535 downstream of the nisa promoter (pnisa). the resulting vector, prsnped, was electrotransformed into strep. thermophilus st128, l. lactis subsp. lactis ml3 and lact. casei c2. presence of the intact vector was confirmed by pcr, resulting in the amplification of a 0.8-kb dna fragment, and inhibition zones were observed for all lactic acid bacteria (lab) transformants following induction with 50 ng ml(-1) nisin, when listeria monocytogenes scott a was used as the target bacterium. using l. monocytogenes nr30 as target, the l. lactis transformants produced hazy zones of inhibition, while the lact. casei transformants produced clear zones of inhibition. zones of inhibition were not observed when the strep.  thermophilus transformants were tested against nr30. conclusions: the lab hosts were able to produce enough pediocin to inhibit the growth of l. monocytogenes scott a; the growth of l. monocytogenes nr30 was effectively inhibited only by the lact. casei transformants. significance and impact of the study: this is the  first time that the nice system has been used to express the intact pediocin operon in these lab hosts. this system could allow for the in situ production of  pediocin in fermented dairy foods supplemented with nisin to prevent listeria contamination.

AB  == atmospheric plasma jets are being intensively studied with respect to potential applications in medicine. the aim of this in vitro study was to test a microwave-powered non-thermal atmospheric plasma jet for its antimicrobial efficacy against adherent oral micro-organisms. agar plates and dentin slices were inoculated with 6 log(10) c.f.u. cm(-2) of lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mutans and candida albicans, with escherichia coli as a control. areas of 1 cm(2) on the agar plates or the complete dentin slices were irradiated with a helium plasma jet for 0.3, 0.6 or 0.9 s mm(-2), respectively. the agar plates were incubated at 37 degrees c, and dentin slices were vortexed in liquid  media and suspensions were placed on agar plates. the killing efficacy of the plasma jet was assessed by counting the number of c.f.u. on the irradiated areas  of the agar plates, as well as by determination of the number of c.f.u. recovered from dentin slices. a microbe-killing effect was found on the irradiated parts of the agar plates for l. casei, s. mutans, c. albicans and e. coli. the plasma-jet  treatment reduced the c.f.u. by 3-4 log(10) intervals on the dentin slices in comparison to recovery rates from untreated controls. the microbe-killing effect  was correlated with increasing irradiation times. thus, non-thermal atmospheric plasma jets could be used for the disinfection of dental surfaces.

AB  == the present study analyzed whether nasal administration of viable and non-viable  lactobacillus casei crl 431 to immunocompromised mice was capable of increasing resistance against streptococcus pneumoniae. weaned mice were malnourished after  consuming a pfd for 21 days. malnourished mice were fed a bcd for 7 days or bcd for 7 days with viable or non-viable l. casei nasal treatments on day 6 and day 7 (bcd+lcv and bcd+lcn, respectively). the mnc group received pfd whereas the wnc mice consumed bcd. mnc mice showed greater lung colonization, more severe lung injuries, impaired leukocyte recruitment and reduced antibodies and cytokine production when compared with wnc mice. administration of l. casei increased the  resistance of malnourished mice to the infection. both bcd+lcv and bcd+lcn treatments prevented the dissemination of the pathogen to the blood and induced its lung clearance. bcd+lcv or bcd+lcn groups showed improved production of tnf-alpha and activity of phagocytes in the respiratory tract, an effect that was not observed in the bcd control group. in addition, il-4 and il-10 were significantly increased in bcd+lcv and bcd+lcn groups, which correlated with the  increase in the levels of specific respiratory iga. the nasal treatments with l.  casei were also effective at stimulating the production of specific igg at both the systemic and the respiratory levels. the comparative study between the viable and the non-viable bacteria demonstrated that viability would be an important factor to achieve maximum protective effects. however, the results from this study suggest that heat-killed lactic acid bacteria are also effective in the immunomodulation of the systemic and respiratory immune system.

TI  == requirement of the lactobacillus casei maekr two-component system for l-malic acid utilization via a malic enzyme pathway.
AB  == lactobacillus casei can metabolize l-malic acid via malolactic enzyme (malolactic fermentation [mlf]) or malic enzyme (me). whereas utilization of l-malic acid via mlf does not support growth, the me pathway enables l. casei to grow on l-malic acid. in this work, we have identified in the genomes of l. casei strains bl23 and atcc 334 a cluster consisting of two diverging operons, maepe and maekr, encoding a putative malate transporter (maep), an me (maee), and a two-component  (tc) system belonging to the citrate family (maek and maer). homologous clusters  were identified in enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus uberis. our results show that me is essential for l-malic acid utilization in l. casei. furthermore, deletion of either the gene encoding the histidine kinase or the response regulator of the tc system resulted in the loss of the ability to grow on l-malic acid, thus indicating that the cognate tc system regulates and is essential for the expression of me. transcriptional analyses showed that expression of maee is induced in the presence of l-malic acid and repressed by glucose, whereas tc system expression was induced by l-malic acid and was not repressed by glucose. dnase i footprinting analysis showed that maer binds specifically to a set of direct repeats [5'-ttatt(a/t)aa-3'] in the mae promoter region. the location of the repeats strongly suggests that maer activates the expression of the diverging operons maepe and maekr where the first one is also subjected to carbon catabolite repression.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of ocimum americanum l. essential oil against oral microorganisms.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of the essential oil of ocimum americanum l. on in vitro activity against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei and candida albicans. an agar disk diffusion method was employed for screening antimicrobial activity. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum cidal concentration (mcc) values of the oil against planktonic  cells were determined using the millipore membrane method. the antimicrobial potential of the essential oil was also investigated with a biofilm model. the results indicate that essential oil has antimicrobial activity against all tested microorganisms. the mic values of the oil against the three organisms was 0.04% v/v whereas the mcc values for s. mutans, l. casei and c. albicans were 0.08%, 0.3% and 0.08% v/v, respectively. s. mutans and c. albicans were more sensitive to the essential oil than l. casei. with the biofilm assay, a 5-minute exposure to 3% v/v essential oil eliminated 3 logo10 of the tested microorganisms. at a lower concentration (0.3% v/v), a 2 log10 reduction in s. mutans and c. albicans  was observed while the lactobacilli were more resistant. this finding indicates the possibility of using the essential oil of o. americanum l. in oral health care products for reducing these pathogenic microorganisms in the oral cavity.

TI  == effect of probiotic supplementation on immunoglobulins, isoagglutinins and antibody response in children of low socio-economic status.
AB  == background: antigen exposure is one of the major exogenous factors modulating human immunocompetence acquisition. decline in family size and improvements in public health and hygiene in developed countries, may deprive the immune system of appropriate antigen input by diminishing infectious stimuli. probiotics are a  large group of microorganisms defined by their beneficial effects on human health and with stimulating effects on different functions of the immune system. aim of  the study: we conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine if  probiotics maintain their immune-stimulating effects in a population of 162 children with a high index of natural exposure to microorganisms. children were to ingest for at least 4 months one of two products, low-fat milk fermented by streptococcus thermophilus (control product) or low-fat milk fermented by s. thermophilus and lactobacillus casei, with lactobacillus acidophilus, oligofructose and inulin added after the fermentation process (test product). according to their age, children were vaccinated with dtp-hib vaccine or a 23-valent anti-pneumococcal vaccine. results: final analysis of results was done  in 70 children in each group, showing that the rate of immunoglobulin and isoagglutinin acquisition was similar in both groups. there was no difference between groups in antibody levels neither before nor after vaccination. days of fever and number of episodes of infection were not statistically different in either group. conclusions: supplementation of standard fermented milk with additional probiotics was not of benefit. the high natural rate of early microbial exposure in infants and children from a population of low socio-economic status living in a "less hygienic environment" may account for the absence of an additional immune-stimulating effect by supplementary probiotics.

TI  == lactobacillus casei modulates the inflammation-coagulation interaction in a pneumococcal pneumonia experimental model.
AB  == background: we have previously demonstrated that lactobacillus casei crl 431 administration improved the resistance to pneumococcal infection in a mouse model. methods: this study examined the effects of the oral administration of lactobacillus casei crl 431 (l. casei) on the activation of coagulation and fibrinolytic systems as well as their inhibitors during a streptococcus pneumoniae infection in mice. results: the alveolo-capillary membrane was damaged and the coagulation system was also activated by the infection. as a consequence, we could see fibrin(ogen) deposits in lung histological slices, increased levels  of thrombin-antithrombin complex (tatc) in bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) and plasma, decrease in prothrombin activity (pt) and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time test (aptt) values. factor vii (fvii) and factor x (fx) were  decreased in plasma, whereas fibrinogen (f) and factor viii (fviii) were increased. the low levels of protein c (pc) in bal and plasma proved damage on inhibitory activity. the infected animals showed reduced fibrinolytic activity, evidenced by an increase in plasminogen activation inhibitor-1 (pai-1) in bal and plasma. the pathogen induced an increase of tnf-alpha, il-1beta and il-6 in bal and serum a few hours after challenge followed by a significant decrease until the end of the assayed period. il-4 and il-10 in bal and serum were also augmented, especially at the end of the experiment. the animals treated with l. casei showed an improvement of alveolo-capillary membrane, lower fibrin(ogen) deposits in lung and decrease in tatc. aptt test and pt, fvii and fx activity were normalized. l. casei group showed lower f levels than control during whole experiment. in the present study no effect of l. casei on the recovery of the inhibitory activity was detected. however, l. casei was effective in reducing pai-1 levels in bal and in increasing anti-inflammatory ils concentration. conclusion: l. casei proved effective to regulate coagulation activation and fibrinolysis inhibition during infection, leading to a decrease in fibrin deposits in lung. this protective effect of l. casei would be mediated by the induction of higher levels of il-4 and il-10 which could regulate the anti-inflammatory, procoagulant and antifibrinolytic effects of tnf-alpha, il-1beta and il-6.

TI  == production of exopolysaccharides by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains of  human origin, and metabolic activity of the producing bacteria in milk.
AB  == this work reports on the physicochemical characterization of 21 exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, as well as the growth and metabolic activity of the eps-producing strains in milk. the strains belong to the species  lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus vaginalis, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. the molar mass distribution of eps fractions showed 2 peaks of different sizes, which is a feature shared with some eps from bacteria of food origin. in general, we detected an association between the eps size distribution and the eps-producing species, although because of the low numbers of human bacterial eps tested, we could not conclusively establish a correlation. the main monosaccharide components of the eps under study were glucose, galactose, and rhamnose, which are the same as those found in food polymers; however, the rhamnose and glucose ratios was generally higher than the  galactose ratio in our human bacterial eps. all eps-producing strains were able to grow and acidify milk; most lactobacilli produced lactic acid as the main metabolite. the lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio in bifidobacteria was 0.7, close to the theoretical ratio, indicating that the eps-producing strains did not produce an excessive amount of acetic acid, which could adversely affect the sensory properties of fermented milks. with respect to their viscosity-intensifying ability, l. plantarum h2 and l. rhamnosus e41 and e43r were able to increase the viscosity of stirred, fermented milks to a similar extent as the eps-producing streptococcus thermophilus strain used as a positive  control. therefore, these human eps-producing bacteria could be used as adjuncts  in mixed cultures for the formulation of functional foods if probiotic characteristics could be demonstrated. this is the first article reporting the physicochemical characteristics of eps isolated from human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == fermented goats' milk produced with selected multiple starters as a potentially functional food.
AB  == a screening among five lactic acid bacteria, used alone or in combination, led to select a mixed starter (streptococcus thermophilus cr12, lactobacillus casei lc01, lactobacillus helveticus pr4, lactobacillus plantarum 1288) capable to produce a fermented goats' milk containing gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba) and angiotensin-i converting enzyme (ace)-inhibitory peptides. the fermented milk was characterized by cell counts of lactic acid bacteria not lower than 7.0 log cfu g(-1), even after 45 days of storage at 4 degrees c. fermentation of goats' milk  resulted in the production of ca. 28 mg kg(-1) of gaba. furthermore the fermented goats' milk had an in vitro ace-inhibitory activity of ca. 73%. prolonged cold storage did not significantly affect both the concentration of gaba and the ace-inhibitory activity. moreover, the taurine content did not significantly vary during both fermentation and the entire storage period.

TI  == identification and characterization of a strain-dependent cystathionine beta/gamma-lyase in lactobacillus casei potentially involved in cysteine biosynthesis.
AB  == the trans-sulfuration pathways allow the interconversion of cysteine and methionine with the intermediary formation of cystathionine and homocysteine. the genome database of lactobacillus casei atcc 334 provides evidence that this species cannot synthesize cysteine from methionine via the trans-sulfuration pathway. however, several l. casei strains use methionine as the sole sulfur source, which implies that these strains can convert methionine to cysteine. cystathionine synthases and lyases play a crucial role in the trans-sulfuration pathway. by applying proteomic techniques, we have identified a protein in cell-free extracts of l. casei, which showed high homology to a gene product encoded in the genome of lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus helveticus but not in the genome of l. casei atcc  334. the presence of the gene was only found in strains able to grow on methionine as the sole sulfur source. moreover, two gene variants were identified. both gene variants were cloned and expressed heterologously in escherichia coli. the recombinant enzymes exhibited cystathionine lyase activity  in vitro and also cleaved cysteine, homocysteine and methionine releasing volatile sulfur compounds.

TI  == does strontium play a role in the cariostatic activity of glass ionomer? strontium diffusion and antibacterial activity.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this work was to evaluate the activity of strontium ions on the main pathogens of the oral flora. the leaching of strontium from resin modified glass ionomer cements (rmgic) was evaluated together with its uptake by  superficial dental enamel. methods: the antibacterial activity was measured by the growth inhibition method following exposure of supra- and sub-gingival bacteria to a range of strontium concentrations (0.19 moll(-1), 0.37 moll(-1), 0.74 moll(-1) and 1.11 moll(-1)). strontium concentrations were analyzed chemically and migration at 5 microm and 15 microm depths was quantified by microprobe following fuji ortho lc application on the vestibular enamel of extracted teeth. results: strontium was found in appreciable amounts (0.8 wt.%) in superficial enamel, but in insignificant concentrations deeper in. at the same time, 8% fluoroapatite was formed in the enamel. under our experimental conditions, strontium had no significant antibacterial activity; only one log reduction of activity was observed at the highest concentrations tested. conclusions: rmgic releases strontium ions which are rapidly exchanged for calcium ions in the superficial enamel. no significant antibacterial activity was observed for strontium ions alone at the concentrations considered. however synergistic effects with fluoride could promote antibacterial activity.

TI  == tgf-beta1 inhibits tlr-mediated odontoblast responses to oral bacteria.
AB  == tgf-beta1 exerts diverse functions in tooth development and tissue repair, but its role in microbial defenses of the tooth is not well-understood. odontoblasts  extending their cellular processes into the dentin are the first cells to recognize signals from tgf-beta1 and bacteria in carious dentin. this study aimed to determine the role of tgf-beta1 in modulating odontoblast responses to oral bacteria. we show that these responses depend upon the expression levels of microbial recognition receptors tlr2 and tlr4 on the cell surface. porphyromonas  gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum activated both tlrs, but tlr4 played a greater role. lack of cell-surface tlr2 was associated with poor response to streptococcus mutans, enterococcus faecalis, and lactobacillus casei. tgf-beta1 inhibited tlr2 and tlr4 expression and attenuated  odontoblast responses. our findings suggest that the balance between tlr-mediated inflammation and tgf-beta1 anti-inflammatory activity plays an important role in  pulpal inflammation.

TI  == antibacterial effect of ozone on cariogenic bacterial species.
AB  == objective: the aim was to evaluate the antibacterial effect of ozone on cariogenic bacterial species with and without the presence of saliva and a possible effect on the salivary proteins. methods: suspensions of actinomyces naeslundii (actcc 12104(t)), lactobacilli casei (n ctc 151) and streptococcus mutans (nctc 10449), in salt buffer or in saliva, were exposed to ozone gas delivered by the ozone generator healozone 2130c. aliquots of the suspensions were taken after 10, 30 and 60s ozone exposures and cultivated on agar plates. initial number of bacteria per ml was 8.0 x 10(7) (sd 2.2 x 10(7)) (a. naeslundii), 1.0 x 10(8) (sd 3.1 x 10(6)) (l. casei) and 1.0 x 10(8) (sd 7.0 x 10(5)) (s. mutans), respectively. the proteins were separated by sds electrophoresis and visualized by silver staining. results: in salt buffer 92%, 73% and 64% of the initial numbers of a. naeslundii, s. mutans and l. casei, respectively, were killed already after 10s ozone exposure, while approximately 99.9% of the bacteria were dead after a 60s exposure. after 10 and 30s, but not after 60s exposure to ozone, s. mutans and l. casei were less efficiently killed  in saliva compared to the salt buffer. various saliva proteins were degraded by ozone after a 60s exposure. conclusions: the cariogenic species s. mutans, l. casei and a. naeslundii were almost eliminated following 60s of ozone treatment.  this killing was reduced in the presence of saliva although increasing the ozone  application time to 60s overcame these reductants in saliva. detection of altered salivary proteins indicates that saliva components constitute additional targets  for ozone.

TI  == lactobacillus casei secreting alpha-msh induces the therapeutic effect on dss-induced acute colitis in balb/c mice.
AB  == the neuropeptide alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha- msh) has anti-inflammatory property by downregulating the expressions of proinflammatory cytokines. because alpha-msh elicits the anti-inflammatory effect in various inflammatory disease models, we examined the therapeutic effect of oral administration of recombinant lactobacillus casei, which secretes alpha-msh (l. casei-alpha-msh), on dextran sulfate sodium (dss)-induced colitis in balb/c mice. thus, we constructed the alpha-msh-secreting lactobacillus casei by the basic plasmid, pluat-ss, which was composed of a pldhutls promoter and alpha-amylase signal sequence from streptococcus bovis strain. acute colitis was induced by oral administration of 5% dss in drinking water for 7 days. to investigate the effect of l. casei-alpha-msh on the colitis, l. casei or l. casei-alpha-msh was orally administered for 7 days and their effects on body weight, mortality rate,  cytokine production, and tissue myeloperoxidase (mpo) activity were observed. administration of l. casei-alpha-msh reduced the symptom of acute colitis as assessed by body weight loss (dss alone: 14.45+/-0. 2 g; l. casei-alpha- msh: 18.2+/-0.12 g), colitis score (dss alone: 3.6+/-0.4; l. casei-alpha-msh: 1.4+/-0.6), mpo activity (dss alone: 42.7+/-4.5 u/g; l. casei-alpha-msh: 10.25+/-0.5 u/g), survival rate, and histological damage compared with the dss alone mice. l. casei-alpha-msh-administered entire colon showed reduced in vitro  production of proinflammatory cytokines and nf-kappab activation. the alpha-msh-secreting recombinant l. casei showed significant anti-inflammatory effects in the murine model of acute colitis and suggests a potential therapeutic role for this agent in clinical inflammatory bowel diseases.

AB  == the aim of this study was to test the antibacterial effects of three experimental quaternary ammonium salt monomers in order to evaluate their potential applications as dental materials. in vitro susceptibility testing of the monomers was performed by the broth dilution method on bacteria associated with oral infections: streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, actinomyces viscosus atcc 15987, staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213 and lactobacillus casei atcc 393. the time-kill  kinetics of the monomer with relatively higher antibacterial activity against s.  mutans were also investigated. it was found that all the tested bacteria strains  were susceptible to the three monomers, among which methacryloxylethyl cetyl ammonium chloride (dmae-cb) exhibited the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations, ranging from 1.2 to 4.8 microg/ml. the time-kill curve showed that dmae-cb achieved 99.44% killing at 19.2 microg/ml (4 times the minimal bactericidal concentration) against s. mutans after 1 min and 100% killing within 10 min of contact. this result indicates that the quaternary ammonium salt monomer dmae-cb may be a candidate antibacterial agent for incorporation into dental restorative materials.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of kaurane diterpenes against oral pathogens.
AB  == two kaurane diterpenes, ent-kaur-16(17)-en-19-oic acid (ka) and 15-beta-isovaleryloxy-ent-kaur-16(17)-en-19-oic acid (ka-ival), isolated from aspilia foliacea, and the methyl ester derivative of ka (ka-me) were evaluated against oral pathogens. ka was the most active compound, with mic values of 10 microg ml(-1) against the following microorganisms: streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, and lactobacillus casei. however, ka did not show significant activity against streptococcus salivarius and enterococcus faecalis, with mic values equal to 100  and 200 microg ml(-1), respectively. our results show that ka has potential to be used as a prototype for the discovery of new effective anti-infection agents against microorganisms responsible for caries and periodontal diseases. moreover, these results allow to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to studies on the structure-activity relationship of this type of metabolites with respect to caries and periodontal diseases.

TI  == the effects of probiotics on ppi-triple therapy for helicobacter pylori eradication.
AB  == background: this study was performed to evaluate whether the addition of probiotics to proton pump inhibitor (ppi)-based triple therapy increases the likelihood of successful helicobacter pylori eradication. materials and methods:  three hundred and forty-seven h. pylori-infected patients were randomized into a  triple-plus-yogurt group (yogurt group, n = 168) or a triple-only group (control  group, n = 179). triple therapy consisted of ppi b.i.d., clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d., and amoxicillin 1 g b.i.d. for 7 days. yogurt group received triple therapy for 1 week and one bottle of will yogurt per day for at 3 weeks, starting on the first day of triple therapy. will yogurt (a korean brand) contains lactobacillus acidophilus hy2177, lactobacillus casei hy2743, bifidobacterium longum hy8001, and streptococcus thermophilus b-1. (13)c-urea breath test was performed at least 4 weeks after completion of triple therapy. eradication rates, compliances, and adverse events were compared. results: by intention-to treat analysis the h. pylori eradication rates in the yogurt group 79.2% (133 of 168) was similar to that in the control group 72.1% (129 of 179) (p = .124). however,  by per-protocol (pp) analysis, the eradication rate in the yogurt group, 87.5% (133 of 152) was higher than that in the control group, 78.7% (129 of 164) (p = .037). common adverse events were metallic taste (11.8%) and diarrhea (8.6%). the frequency of adverse effects in the yogurt group 41.1% (69/168) were higher than  in the control group, 26.3% (47 of 179) (p = .003). however, most adverse events  were mild to moderate in intensity, and the severities of adverse effects were similar in both groups (p = .401). conclusions: the addition of will yogurt to triple therapy did not reduce the side-effects of triple therapy. but it increased the h. pylori eradication rate by pp analysis, encouraging more research in this field.

TI  == microbiological, chemical, and sensory characteristics of swiss cheese manufactured with adjunct lactobacillus strains using a low cooking temperature.
AB  == the effect of nonstarter lactobacillus adjunct cultures on the microbial, chemical, and sensory characteristics of swiss cheese manufactured using the "kosher make procedure" was investigated. the kosher make procedure, which uses a lower cooking temperature than traditional swiss cheese making, is used by many american cheese manufacturers to allow for kosher-certified whey. cheeses were manufactured using a commercial starter culture combination and 1 of 3 non-starter lactobacillus strains previously isolated from swiss cheeses, lactobacillus casei a26, l. casei b21, and lactobacillus rhamnosus h2, as an adjunct. control cheeses lacked the adjunct culture. cheeses were analyzed during ripening for microbial and chemical composition. adjunct strain l. casei a26, which utilized citrate most readily in laboratory medium, dominated the lactobacillus population within 30 d, faster than the other adjunct cultures. there were no significant differences in propionibacterium counts, streptococcus  thermophilus counts, protein, fat, moisture, salt, and ph among the cheeses. free amino acid concentration ranged from 5 to 7 mmol/100 g of cheese at 90 d of ripening and was adjunct strain dependent. lactic, acetic, and propionic acid concentrations were not significantly different among the cheeses after a 90-d ripening period; however differences in propionic acid concentrations were apparent at 60 d, with the cheeses made with l. casei adjuncts containing less propionic acid. citric acid was depleted by the end of warm room ripening in cheeses manufactured with adjunct l. casei strains, but not with adjunct l. rhamnosus. cheeses made with l. casei a26 were most similar to the control cheeses in diacetyl and butyric/isobutyric acid abundance as evaluated by electronic nose during the first 3 mo of ripening. the 4 cheese types differed in their descriptive sensory profiles at 8 mo of age, indicating an adjunct strain-dependent effect on particular flavor attributes. adjunct lactobacillus spp. affected the flavor profile and concentration of some flavor compounds in swiss cheeses produced with the kosher make procedure. use of adjunct lactobacillus cultures provides swiss cheese makers using a low cooking temperature with a means to control the dominant lactobacillus strain during ripening, reduce citrate concentration, and modify cheese flavor.

TI  == probiotic bacteria affect the composition of salivary pellicle and streptococcal  adhesion in vitro.
AB  == introduction: the use of probiotic bacteria is increasing worldwide and at least  some of them can transiently colonize the oral cavity. several studies have shown that probiotic bacteria, which are often thought of in relation only to intestinal health, can also affect the oral ecology, but the mechanisms for this  are largely unknown. the aim of this study was to investigate in vitro if the probiotic bacteria used in commercial products affect the protein composition of  the salivary pellicle and the adherence of other oral bacteria. methods: salivary pellicle on hydroxyapatite and the adhesion of two oral streptococci, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus gordonii, were used as a model. results: probiotic bacteria that bound to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite reduced the adhesion of s. mutans but the inhibitory effect on the adherence of s. gordonii was weaker. salivary pellicle protein composition was modified by all the strains tested. the modifications in the pellicle affected the adherence of s. mutans but not of s. gordonii. two of the proteins missing from the pellicles made of saliva-treated with the probiotic bacteria were identified as salivary agglutinin gp340 and salivary peroxidase. all bacterial strains bound salivary agglutinin gp340. the ability of the probiotic bacteria to degrade peroxidase was demonstrated with purified bovine lactoperoxidase and two of the probiotic strains. conclusion: this in vitro study showed that probiotic strains used in commercial products may affect the oral ecology by specifically preventing the adherence of other bacteria and by modifying the protein composition of the salivary pellicle.

TI  == new strategy for enhancement of microbial viability in simulated gastric conditions based on display of starch-binding domain on cell surface.
AB  == the c-terminal region of the peptidoglycan hydrolase (cph) of lactococcus lactis  il1403 fused to the linker region and the starch-binding domain (sbd) of the *-amylase of streptococcus bovis 148 was produced intracellularly in escherichia  coli. the fusion protein (cph-sbd) was able to bind to the cell surface of lactobacillus casei nrrl b-441 and to corn starch. therefore, adhesion of cells to corn starch was mediated by the fusion protein. at a cell density of 10(9) cfu/ml and a starch concentration of 5 mg/ml, cph-sbd-displaying l. casei cells aggregated with corn starch, whereas the free cells of l. casei did not form any  aggregates with corn starch. after incubation in simulated gastric juice (ph 3.0, 1 h), the survival percentages of free cells, amylose-coated free cells, and free cells mixed with corn starch were 0.074%, 7.2%, and 3.1% respectively. when cph-sbd-displaying bacteria aggregated with corn starch, their survival percentage was 8% higher than that of free cells mixed with corn starch. the survival of the amylose-coated cph-sbd-displaying l. casei cells was comparable to that of amylose-coated free cells, whereas the survival percentage of amylose-coated aggregates of cph-sbd-displaying bacteria with corn starch was 28% higher than that of amylose-coated mixture of free cells with corn starch. these  results demonstrate the potential usefulness of the cell-surface display technique for enhancement of the delivery of viable microorganisms to the intestinal tract.

TI  == nasal immunization of mice with lactobacillus casei expressing the pneumococcal surface protein a: induction of antibodies, complement deposition and partial protection against streptococcus pneumoniae challenge.
AB  == strategies for the development of new vaccines against streptococcus pneumoniae infections try to overcome problems such as serotype coverage and high costs, present in currently available vaccines. formulations based on protein candidates that can induce protection in animal models have been pointed as good alternatives. among them, the pneumococcal surface protein a (pspa) plays an important role during systemic infection at least in part through the inhibition  of complement deposition on the pneumococcal surface, a mechanism of evasion from the immune system. antigen delivery systems based on live recombinant lactic acid bacteria (lab) represents a promising strategy for mucosal vaccination, since they are generally regarded as safe bacteria able to elicit both systemic and mucosal immune responses. in this work, the n-terminal region of clade 1 pspa was constitutively expressed in lactobacillus casei and the recombinant bacteria was  tested as a mucosal vaccine in mice. nasal immunization with l. casei-pspa 1 induced anti-pspa antibodies that were able to bind to pneumococcal strains carrying both clade 1 and clade 2 pspas and to induce complement deposition on the surface of the bacteria. in addition, an increase in survival of immunized mice after a systemic challenge with a virulent pneumococcal strain was observed.

TI  == impact of lux gene insertion on bacterial surface properties and transport.
AB  == genetic markers have been in popular use for tracing microbial movement in the environment. however, the impact of genetic marker insertion on microbial surface properties and consequent transport is often ignored. for this research, we investigated the impact of luminescence-based genetic marker insertion on bacterial surface properties and transport. typical gram-positive bacterial strains of lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mitis and micrococcus luteus were used as model bacterial strains in this research. we manipulated gene transfer to observe the impact of lux gene insertion on bacterial surface properties based on contact angle measurements, and we conducted column experiments to evaluate the impact of lux gene insertion on bacterial transport. after lux gene insertion, bacterial interactions with the porous media increased, demonstrating stronger deposition potential in the porous media. accordingly, retention of the daughter  strains increased. lux gene insertion also resulted in an increase in bacterial dispersion and equilibrium adsorption in the porous media. the bacterial deposition coefficient was found to correlate with the free energy of interactions between bacteria and the porous media.

TI  == probiotic crescenza cheese containing lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus acidophilus manufactured with high-pressure homogenized milk.
AB  == high-pressure homogenization (hph) is one of the most promising alternatives to traditional thermal treatment of food preservation and diversification. its effectiveness on the deactivation of pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms in model systems and real food is well documented. to evaluate the potential of milk treated by hph for the production of crescenza cheese with commercial probiotic lactobacilli added, 4 types of cheeses were made: hph (from hph-treated milk), p  (from pasteurized milk), hph-p (hph-treated milk plus probiotics), and p-p (pasteurized milk plus probiotics) cheeses. a strain of streptococcus thermophilus was used as starter culture for cheese production. compositional, microbiological, physicochemical, and organoleptic analyses were carried out at 1, 5, 8, and 12 d of refrigerated storage (4 degrees c). according to results obtained, no significant differences among the 4 cheese types were observed for gross composition (protein, fat, moisture) and ph. differently, the hph treatment of milk increased the cheese yield about 1% and positively affected the viability during the refrigerated storage of the probiotic bacteria. in fact, after 12 d of storage, the lactobacillus paracasei a13 cell loads were 8 log cfu/ g, whereas lactobacillus acidophilus h5 exhibited, in p-p cheese, a cell load decrease of about 1 log cfu/g with respect to the hph-p cheese. the hyperbaric treatment had  a significant positive effect on free fatty acids release and cheese proteolysis. also, probiotic cultures affected proteolytic and lipolytic cheese patterns. no significant differences were found for the sensory descriptors salty and creamy among hph and p cheeses as well as for acid, piquant, sweet, milky, salty, creamy, and overall acceptance among hph, hph-p, and p-p crescenza cheeses.

AB  == synthesis of oligosaccharides during milk fermentation was attempted by inoculating leuconostoc citreum with lactobacillus casei, lb. delbrueckii subsp.  bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus as starters. dextransucrase of ln. citreum worked as a catalyst for the transglycosylation reaction of sugars; sucrose was added as the glucose donor, and lactose or maltose acted as the acceptor compound for the reaction. when 4% sucrose was added in milk, glucosyl-lactose was synthesized (about 1%, w/v) after 1-2 days of fermentation at 15 or 25 degrees c. alternatively, when sucrose and maltose (2% each, w/v) were added, panose (about 1%, w/v) and other isomaltooligosaccharides were made in a day at 15-35 degrees c. growth patterns of lactobacilli and streptococci starters were not affected by the coculture of leuconostoc starter, but the rate  of acid synthesis was slightly slowed at every temperature. addition of sugars in milk did not give any adverse effect on the lactate fermentation. accordingly, the use of leuconostoc starter and addition of sugars in milk allowed the production of oligosaccharides-containing fermented milk, and application of this method will facilitate the extensive development of synbiotic lactate foods.

TI  == the effect of daily consumption of probiotic and conventional yoghurt on oxidant  and anti-oxidant parameters in plasma of young healthy women.
AB  == in recent years there has been increasing interest in the potential beneficial effects of probiotic bacteria, particularly concerning their immune-modulating effects. considering the involvement of free radicals in immunological processes, we tried to verify and compare the effects of probiotic (lactobacillus casei) and conventional yoghurt on antioxidant and oxidant parameters in plasma of humans. in this study female volunteers consumed 100 g/day of probiotic (n = 17) or conventional yoghurt (n = 16) for two weeks (t1-t2) and 200 g/day for another two weeks (t2-t3). a wash-out phase lasting two weeks followed. total antioxidant capacity (tac), albumin, and bilirubin were determined photometrically, uric acid was determined by enzymatic methods, and vitamin e, carotenoids, malondialdehyde  (mda), and conjugated dienes (cd) were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). in the period of continuous yoghurt intake (t1-t3), mean concentrations of the antioxidants vitamin e, lycopene, and zeaxanthin decreased  significantly (p < 0.01) in the probiotic and in the control group. the average concentrations of lutein, beta-carotene, albumin, uric acid, and bilirubin decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in the probiotic group, only. these alterations led to a significant (p < 0.001) decrease of the average tac values during the period t1-t3 in both tested groups. in the interval of daily yoghurt consumption (t1-t3) the mean plasma levels of oxidant parameters mda and cd increased significantly in the probiotic (mda: p < 0.01; cd: p < 0.001) and the control group (cd: p < 0.01). the average activity of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (sod) was quite constant throughout the study in both groups. the mean activities of gsh-px and catalase decreased significantly (p < 0.001) in the probiotic group, only after consuming yoghurt daily for four weeks  (t1-t3). although several parameters changed significantly during the study, no significant differences were observed between both investigated groups. therefore, the results indicate a possible influence of both probiotic and conventional yoghurt on the plasma levels of antioxidant and oxidant parameters.

TI  == nonstarter lactobacillus strains as adjunct cultures for cheese making: in vitro  characterization and performance in two model cheeses.
AB  == nonstarter lactic acid bacteria are the main uncontrolled factor in today's industrial cheese making and may be the cause of quality inconsistencies and defects in cheeses. in this context, adjunct cultures of selected lactobacilli from nonstarter lactic acid bacteria origin appear as the best alternative to indirectly control cheese biota. the objective of the present work was to study the technological properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from cheese by in  vitro and in situ assays. milk acidification kinetics and proteolytic and acidifying activities were assessed, and peptide mapping of trichloroacetic acid  8% soluble fraction of milk cultures was performed by liquid chromatography. in addition, the tolerance to salts (nacl and kcl) and the phage-resistance were investigated. four strains were selected for testing as adjunct cultures in cheese making experiments at pilot plant scale. in in vitro assays, most strains  acidified milk slowly and showed weak to moderate proteolytic activity. fast strains decreased milk ph to 4.5 in 8 h, and continued acidification to 3.5 in 12 h or more. this group consisted mostly of lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus rhamnosus strains. approximately one-third of the slow strains, which comprised mainly lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus curvatus, were capable to grow when milk was supplemented with glucose and casein hydrolysate. peptide maps were similar to those of lactic acid bacteria considered to have a moderate proteolytic activity. most strains showed  salt tolerance and resistance to specific phages. the lactobacillus strains selected as adjunct cultures for cheese making experiments reached 10(8) cfu/g in soft cheeses at 7 d of ripening, whereas they reached 10(9) cfu/g in semihard cheeses after 15 d of ripening. in both cheese varieties, the adjunct culture population remained at high counts during all ripening, in some cases overcoming  or equaling primary starter. overall, proximate composition of cheeses with and without added lactobacilli did not differ; however, some of the tested strains continued acidifying during ripening, which was mainly noticed in soft cheeses and affected overall quality of the products. the lactobacilli strains with low acidifying activity showed appropriate technological characteristics for their use as adjunct cultures in soft and semihard cheeses.

TI  == use of probiotic lactobacillus preparation to prevent diarrhoea associated with antibiotics: randomised double blind placebo controlled trial.
AB  == objective: to determine the efficacy of a probiotic drink containing lactobacillus for the prevention of any diarrhoea associated with antibiotic use  and that caused by clostridium difficile. design: randomised double blind placebo controlled study. participants: 135 hospital patients (mean age 74) taking antibiotics. exclusions included diarrhoea on admission, bowel pathology that could result in diarrhoea, antibiotic use in the previous four weeks, severe illness, immunosuppression, bowel surgery, artificial heart valves, and history of rheumatic heart disease or infective endocarditis. intervention: consumption of a 100 g (97 ml) drink containing lactobacillus casei, l bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus twice a day during a course of antibiotics and for one week after the course finished. the placebo group received a longlife sterile milkshake. main outcome measures: primary outcome: occurrence of antibiotic associated diarrhoea. secondary outcome: presence of c difficile toxin and diarrhoea. results: 7/57 (12%) of the probiotic group developed diarrhoea associated with antibiotic use compared with 19/56 (34%) in the placebo group (p=0.007). logistic regression to control for other factors gave an odds ratio 0.25 (95% confidence interval 0.07 to 0.85) for use of the probiotic, with low albumin and sodium also increasing the risk of diarrhoea. the absolute risk reduction was 21.6% (6.6% to 36.6%), and the number needed to treat was 5 (3 to 15). no one in the probiotic group and 9/53 (17%) in the placebo group had diarrhoea caused by c difficile (p=0.001). the absolute risk reduction was 17% (7% to 27%), and the number needed to treat was 6 (4 to 14). conclusion: consumption of a probiotic drink containing l casei, l bulgaricus, and s thermophilus can reduce the incidence of antibiotic associated diarrhoea and c difficile associated diarrhoea. this has the potential to decrease morbidity, healthcare costs, and mortality if used routinely in patients aged over 50. trial registration: national research register n0016106821.

TI  == novel chlorhexidine releasing system developed from thermosensitive vinyl ether-based hydrogels.
AB  == the aim of this study is to determine the effective concentrations of chlorhexidine on the release for prolonged periods of time from a novel hydrogel  system. a hydrogel that exhibits a volume phase transition in response to temperature was synthesized by radiation copolymerization of ethylene glycol vinyl ether and butyl vinyl ether in the presence of crosslinking agent, diethylene glycol divinyl ether. hydrogel samples in the disc form (diameter, 10  mm and height, 1.5 mm) were utilized as a matrix for the release of an antimicrobial agent, chlorhexidine diacetate. chlorhexidine loading into the hydrogel was performed by water sorption at 4 degrees c, which allows high swelling and thus high loading capacity, i.e., approximately 36 mg drug per gram  of dry gel. chlorhexidine release was examined as short-term (24 h) and long-term (27 days) by uv spectrophotometer. microbial studies were carried out by micro-dilution method in order to determine the effectiveness of the drug release. minimum inhibitory concentration values for the pathogens of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus casei were determined. the long-term chlorhexidine release is initially very fast. after that, the drug release reaches a slow but a steady rate. such a release pattern provides an effective drug release. the prolonged release of chlorhexidine is continued up to the 27th  day. mic values for the two pathogens have been shown that the release rate from  disc is effective to inhibit the growth of pathogens. these in vitro drug release results suggested that the thermosensitive hydrogel system developed in this study can be evaluated as a delivery system for the release of chlorhexidine.

TI  == nonstarter lactobacilli isolated from soft and semihard argentinean cheeses: genetic characterization and resistance to biological barriers.
AB  == nonstarter lactic acid bacteria isolated from argentinean cheeses were identified and characterized by focusing on their resistance to biological barriers, along with other physiological features of potential interest, in the search for future probiotic organisms. lactobacilli were enumerated and isolated from semihard and  soft cheeses made with multistrain streptococcus thermophilus starters. lactobacilli counts in 1-week-old cheeses were between 10(5) and 10(7) cfu/g and  then reached 10(7) cfu/ g in all 1-month samples, while streptococci were always  above 10(9) cfu/g. a total number of 22 lactobacilli isolates were retained, identified, and characterized by in vitro tests. species identity was determined  by carbohydrate metabolism and species-specific pcr assays. genetic diversity was explored by random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) pcr analysis. the lactobacillus strains were assigned to the species l. casei, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, and l. perolens. all the strains studied tolerated 25 ppm of lysozyme, and most of them showed resistance to 0.3% bile. after incubation in gastric solution (ph 2.0), counts decreased by several log units, ranging from 3.2 to 7.0. the strains were able to grow in the presence of  bile salts, but only three isolates were capable of deconjugation. the nonstarter lactobacilli that were assayed fermented the prebiotic substrates (especially lactulose and inulin). some strains showed high cell hydrophobicity and beta-galactosidase activity, as well as inhibitory activity against pathogenic bacteria. it was concluded that most of the lactobacilli isolated in this study demonstrated resistance to biological barriers and physiological characteristics  compatible with probiotic properties, which make them suitable for further research in in vivo studies aimed at identifying new probiotic organisms.

TI  == calcium modulates interactions between bacteria and hydroxyapatite.
AB  == bacterial adhesion onto hydroxyapatite is known to depend on the surface properties of both the biomaterial and the bacterial strain, but less is known about the influence of the composition of the aqueous medium. here, the adhesion  of streptococcus mutans and 3 different lactobacilli on powdered hydroxyapatite was shown to change with ca2+ concentration. the effect depends on the surface properties of each strain. adhesion of lactobacillus fermentum and salivarius (and of streptococcus mutans at low ca2+) was enhanced with increasing ca2+ concentration. lactobacillus casei was efficiently removed by adhesion on hydroxyapatite, even without ca2+ addition, and the effect of this ion was only marginal. the results are interpreted in terms of ca2+-mediated adhesion, and relative to the hydrophobic properties of each strain and the electrical properties of the bacterial and solid surfaces (electrophoretic mobility).

TI  == bioproduction of conjugated linoleic acid by probiotic bacteria occurs in vitro and in vivo in mice.
AB  == probiotics have been shown to reduce the incidence of colon cancer in animal models. the mechanisms responsible for this activity are poorly defined. conjugated linoleic acids (cla) are a group of isomers of linoleic acid (la) possessing anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties, which can be produced from la by certain bacterial strains. in this study, the ability of probiotic bacteria to exert anticarcinogenic effects through the production of cla was assessed. incubation of probiotic bacteria (vsl3, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. plantarum, bifidobacterium breve, b. infantis, b. longum, and streptococcus thermophilus) in the presence of la yielded cla production as measured by gas chromatography. conditioned medium, containing probiotic-produced cla, reduced viability and induced apoptosis of ht-29 and caco-2 cells, as assessed by mtt assay and dna laddering, respectively. western blotting demonstrated an increased expression of ppargamma in cells treated with conditioned medium compared with la alone. incubation of murine feces with la after administering vsl3 yielded 100-fold more cla than feces collected prior to vsl3 feeding. this study supports a role for supplemental probiotics as a strategy both for attenuating inflammation and for preventing colon cancer.

TI  == induction of systemic and mucosal immune response and decrease in streptococcus pneumoniae colonization by nasal inoculation of mice with recombinant lactic acid bacteria expressing pneumococcal surface antigen a.
AB  == mucosal epithelia constitute the first barriers to be overcome by pathogens during infection. the induction of protective iga in this location is important for the prevention of infection and can be achieved through different mucosal immunization strategies. lactic acid bacteria have been tested in the last few years as live vectors for the delivery of antigens at mucosal sites, with promising results. in this work, streptococcus pneumoniae psaa antigen was expressed in different species of lactic acid bacteria, such as lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus helveticus. after nasal inoculation of c57bl/6 mice, their ability to induce both systemic (igg in serum) and mucosal (iga in saliva, nasal and bronchial washes) anti-psaa antibodies was determined. immunization with l. lactis mg1363 induced very low levels of iga and igg, possibly by the low amount of psaa expressed in this strain and its short persistence in the nasal mucosa. all three lactobacilli persisted in the nasal mucosa for 3 days and produced a similar amount of psaa protein (150-250 ng per 10(9) cfu). however, l. plantarum ncdo1193 and l. helveticus atcc15009 elicited the highest antibody response (iga and igg). vaccination with recombinant lactobacilli but not with recombinant l. lactis led  to a decrease in s. pneumoniae recovery from nasal mucosa upon a colonization challenge. our results confirm that certain lactobacillus strains have intrinsic  properties that make them suitable candidates for mucosal vaccination experiments.

AB  == the occurrence of dental caries is mainly associated with oral pathogens, especially cariogenic streptococcus mutans. preliminary antibacterial screening revealed that the extract of myristica fragrans, widely cultivated for the spice  and flavor of foods, possessed strong inhibitory activity against s. mutans. the  anticariogenic compound was successfully isolated from the methanol extract of m. fragrans by repeated silica gel chromatography, and its structure was identified  as macelignan by instrumental analysis using 1d-nmr, 2d-nmr and ei-ms. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of macelignan against s. mutans was 3.9 microg/ml, which was much lower than those of other natural anticariogenic agents such as 15.6 microg/ml of sanguinarine, 250 microg/ml of eucalyptol, 500 microg/ml of menthol and thymol, and 1000 microg/ml of methyl salicylate. macelignan also possessed preferential activity against other oral microorganisms such as streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis,  lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei in the mic range of 2-31.3 microg/ml. in particular, the bactericidal test showed that macelignan, at a concentration of 20 microg/ml, completely inactivated s. mutans in 1 min. the specific activity and fast-effectiveness of macelignan against oral bacteria strongly suggest that it could be employed as a natural antibacterial agent in functional foods or oral care products.

TI  == display of alpha-amylase on the surface of lactobacillus casei cells by use of the pgsa anchor protein, and production of lactic acid from starch.
AB  == we developed a new cell surface engineering system based on the pgsa anchor protein from bacillus subtilis. in this system, the n terminus of the target protein was fused to the pgsa protein and the resulting fusion protein was expressed on the cell surface. using this new system, we constructed a novel starch-degrading strain of lactobacillus casei by genetically displaying alpha-amylase from the streptococcus bovis strain 148 with a flag peptide tag (amyaf). localization of the pgsa-amya-flag fusion protein on the cell surface was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometric analysis. the  lactic acid bacteria which displayed amyaf showed significantly elevated hydrolytic activity toward soluble starch. by fermentation using amyaf-displaying l. casei cells, 50 g/liter of soluble starch was reduced to 13.7 g/liter, and 21.8 g/liter of lactic acid was produced within about 24 h. the yield in terms of grams of lactic acid produced per gram of carbohydrate utilized was 0.60 g per g  of carbohydrate consumed at 24 h. since amya was immobilized on the cells, cells  were recovered after fermentation and used repeatedly. during repeated utilization of cells, the lactic acid yield was improved to 0.81 g per g of carbohydrate consumed at 72 h. these results indicate that efficient simultaneous saccharification and fermentation from soluble starch to lactic acid were carried out by recombinant l. casei cells with cell surface display of amya.

TI  == the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence.
AB  == some novel caries detection and excavation devices rely on the ability of bacteria to produce red fluorescing compounds. the aim of this study was to examine the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence. streptococcus mutans, s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus fermentans, l. casei, l. rhamnosus, actinomyces naeslundi, a. israelii, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum were inoculated onto columbia  agar with haemin and vitamin k and incubated anaerobically for up to 7 days in the dark. the resulting bacterial colonies were excited using filtered xenon light (405 +/- 20 nm) and digitally photographed through a 530-nm high-pass filter. the red and green portions of the colony fluorescence were analyzed using a computer program and the red/green ratio was calculated. all colonies emitted both red and green fluorescence. the green outweighed the red portion for the following species (in descending order) s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. mutans, f. nucleatum and s. sobrinus. the red portion was higher for the following species (in descending order) p. intermedia, a. naeslundi, a. israelii, l. fermentans, l. rhamnosus and l. casei. with all the bacteria examined, one color portion generally outweighed the other, giving the visual impression of either red or green fluorescence. we conclude that red fluorescence is well suited to detection of the bacteria which cause dentin caries but it is not suitable as an indicator  of the presence and activity of the streptococci involved in initial caries.

TI  == [partial sequence homology of ftsz in phylogenetics analysis of lactic acid bacteria].
AB  == ftsz is a structurally conserved protein, which is universal among the prokaryotes. it plays a key role in prokaryote cell division. a partial fragment  of the ftsz gene about 800bp in length was amplified and sequenced and a partial  ftsz protein phylogenetic tree for the lactic acid bacteria was constructed. by comparing the ftsz phylogenetic tree with the 16s rdna tree, it was shown that the two trees were similar in topology. both trees revealed that pediococcus spp. were closely related with l. casei group of lactobacillus spp. , but less related with other lactic acid cocci such as enterococcus and streptococcus. the results  also showed that the discriminative power of ftsz was higher than that of 16s rdna for either inter-species or inter-genus and could be a very useful tool in species identification of lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells by using chitosan-immobilized silica.
AB  == cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells were conducted by using chitosan-immobilized silica (cis). when chitosan was immobilized onto silica surfaces with glutaraldehyde, bacterial cells adsorbed well and retained viability. testing of the adsorption and desorption ability of  cis using various microbes such as escherichia coli, aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, saccharomyces cerevisiae, saccharomyces ludwigii, and schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed that most microbes could be adsorbed and selectively desorbed under different conditions. in particular, recovery was improved when l-cysteine was added. a mixture of two bacterial strains adsorbed onto cis could also be successfully separated by use of specific solutions for each strain. most of the desorbed cells were alive. thus, quantitative and selective fractionation of cells is readily achievable by  employing chitosan, a known antibacterial material.

TI  == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

AB  == the presence of lactic acid bacteria (lab) during shochu fermentation was monitored by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and by bacteriological culturing. no lab were detected from fermented mashes by pcr-dgge using a universal bacterial pcr primer set. however, pcr-dgge using a new primer  specific for the 16s rdna of lactococcus, streptococcus, tetragenococcus, enterococcus, and vagococcus and two primers specific for the 16s rdna of lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, and weissella revealed that enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus nagelii, lactobacillus plantarum, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and weissella cibaria inhabited in shochu mashes. it was also found that the lab community composition during shochu fermentation changed after the main ingredient and water were added during the fermentation process. therefore, we confirmed that pcr-dgge using all three primers specific for groups of lab together was well suited to the study of the lab diversity in shochu mashes. the results of dgge profiles were similar to the results of bacteriological culturing. in conclusion, lab are present during shochu fermentation but not dominant.

TI  == antibacterial effects and physical properties of glass-ionomer cements containing chlorhexidine for the art approach.
AB  == objectives: since atraumatic restorative treatment (art) involves removal of carious lesions with manual instruments, improvement of filling materials to guarantee greater success should be considered. this study aimed to evaluate antibacterial, physical, and bonding properties of glass-ionomer cements (gic) containing chlorhexidine (chx), and to determine optimal concentrations for incorporation of agents to obtain antibacterial gics for use with the art approach. methods: chx diacetate combined with chx dihydrochloride was added to control gic powder to obtain concentration ratios of 1/0, 2/0, 3/0, 1/1, or 2/2%  w/w. antibacterial activity of each cement against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei or actinomyces naeslundii was examined using agar-diffusion methods, and release of chx was analyzed by hplc. compressive strength, bond strength to dentin, and setting time were measured, and compared with those of control samples. results: all experimental gics exhibited inhibition of three bacteria, but sizes of inhibition zones and concentrations of chx released were not dependent upon chx content. incorporation of chx diacetate at 2% or greater,  significantly decreased compressive strength, and bond strength to dentin was adversely affected by addition of chx diacetate at 2% or more (p<0.05, anova, fisher's plsd test), although setting time was extended a little by addition of any concentrations of chx. significance: the present results demonstrate that experimental gics containing chx are effective in inhibiting bacteria associated  with caries, and incorporation of 1% chx diacetate is optimal to give appropriate physical and bonding properties.

TI  == effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB  == fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. in this study, three sourdough yeasts, candida milleri cbs 8195, saccharomyces cerevisiae ts 146, and torulaspora delbrueckii ts 207; a control, baker's yeast s. cerevisiae alko 743; and four lactobacillus spp., l. acidophilus tsb 262, l. brevis tsb 307, l. plantarum tsb 304, and l. sanfranciscensis tsb 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. the microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. total folate contents were determined using lactobacillus rhamnosus (atcc 7469) as the growth  indicator organism. the microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised  rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g  after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. strains of lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, l. helveticus, pediococcus spp., and streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. although the four lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal.  it was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as enterobacter cowanii and pantoea agglomerans.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial effects of the dentin primer of clearfil protect bond.
AB  == objectives: this study aimed to investigate the antibacterial effects of the dentin primer of a commercially available self-etching adhesive system, clearfil  protect bond, which contains antibacterial monomer 12-methacryloyloxydodecylpyridinium bromide (mdpb). methods: inhibitory effects against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei, or actinomyces naeslundii were examined by an agar-disc diffusion method using the clearfil protect bond primer  containing 5% mdpb and an acidic adhesion-promoting monomer mdp, the primer only  with mdp, and the primer with 1% cetylpyridinium chloride. the minimum inhibitory/bactericidal concentrations (mic/mbc) of each primer for the three bacterial species were determined by serial microdilution assays. for testing the bactericidal effects seen in dentin, the primer was applied to demineralized dentin blocks in which s. mutans had been impregnated, and numbers of viable bacteria were counted. results: for all three bacteria, the sizes of the inhibition zones produced by clearfil protect bond primer were significantly greater than for the other primers (p<0.05, anova and scheffe's f-test). the mic/mbc values of clearfil protect bond primer were less than those of the primer without mdpb, and comparable to those of the primer containing cetylpyridinium chloride. no bacterial recovery was obtained after application of clearfil protect bond primer to the bacteria-impregnated dentin, although the primer without mdpb showed some bactericidal effect. significance: clearfil protect bond primer has strong antibacterial activity based upon mdpb against s. mutans, l. casei and a. naeslundii, and the capability to disinfect cavities containing residual bacteria.

AB  == bacteriocin-producing strains of lactobacillus plantarum st23ld and st341ld, enterococcus faecium st311ld and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides st33ld were isolated from the brine of spoiled black olives. the bacteriocins produced by all four strains inhibited the growth of gram-positive bacteria (e. faecalis, l. casei and streptococcus pneumoniae), but also escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. strain st23ld produced two bacteriocins (st23lda and st23ldb of approximately 3.0 and 14.0 kda, respectively), with a combined maximum level of activity of 25,600 au/ml after 18 h of growth. the same level of activity was recorded for bacteriocin st341ld (approximately 3.0 kda), but after  16 h. bacteriocins st311ld (ca. 2.3 kda) and st33ld (ca. 2.7 kda) were produced at much lower levels (6400 au/ml), and only after 20 h of growth. bacteriocin activity was destroyed after treatment with proteolytic enzymes and triton x, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta, or when heated for 20 min at 121 degrees c. addition of bacteriocins st23ld, st341ld and st311ld to cells of lactobacillus casei lhs in logarithmic phase resulted in  growth inhibition for one hour, followed by a slight increase in optical density  over the next seven hours. bacteriocin st33ld also inhibited the growth of strain lhs, but to a lesser extent. bacteriocins st23ld, st341ld and st33ld remained at  the same level of activity for 6 h at ph<4.0. however, the activity of bacteriocin st311ld decreased by 50% within 2 h at ph 4.4. the possibility of the bacteriocin adsorbing to the producer cell and proteolytic degradation is unlikely.

TI  == bacterial adhesion to silica sand as related to gibbs energy variations.
AB  == bacterial adhesion to silica sand was related to variations in system gibbs energy deltag(adh). two typical gram-positive bacterial strains of streptococcus  mitis and lactobacillus casei were used as the model bacteria in this research. impacts of solution chemistry and goethite coating of silica sand on bacterial adhesion were also explored. s. mitis and l. casei had negative deltag(adh) with  both uncoated and goethite-coated silica sand, demonstrating their adhesion potentials to these substrate. after goethite coating, deltag(adh) decreased (negatively increased) for both s. mitis and l. casei. in the presence of rhamnolipid biosurfactant, deltag(adh) increased (negatively decreased) in answer to the increase of the rhamnolipid biosurfactant concentration. bacterial percentage adhesion to silica sand corresponded to deltag(adh). this study demonstrated that bacterial adhesion to substrate could be explained in terms of  bacterial, substratum and intervening medium physicochemical surface properties,  which can be independently determined based on contact angle measurements.

TI  == salivary actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 and lactobacillus casei levels predict pregnancy outcomes.
AB  == background: gravida's poor periodontal health is emerging as a modifiable independent risk factor for preterm delivery and low birth weight. methods: to test the hypothesis that oral bacteria other than periodontal pathogens are also  associated with pregnancy outcomes, specific oral bacterial levels measured during pregnancy were evaluated in relation to gestational age and birth weight while controlling for demographic, medical, and dental variables. the study population consisted of 297 predominantly african- american women who were pregnant for the first time. the salivary bacterial levels evaluated were streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus sanguinus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, actinomyces naeslundii genospecies (gsp) 1 and 2, total streptococci, and total cultivable organisms. results: for 1 unit increase in log(10) a. naeslundii gsp 2 levels, there was a 60 gm decrease in birth weight (beta = -59.7 g; se = 29.1; p = 0.04), and a 0.17  week decrease in gestational age (beta = -0.17 wk; se = 0.09; p = 0.05). in contrast, per 1 unit increase in log(10) l. casei levels, there was a 42 gm increase in birth weight (beta = 42.2 g; se = 19.3; p = 0.03), and a 0.13 week increase in gestational age (beta = 0.13 week; se = 0.06; p = 0.04). conclusions: we conclude that other oral bacterial species can also be related to pregnancy outcomes in addition to previously reported periodontal pathogens. these organism levels may not only predict poor pregnancy outcomes, but also be used as modifiable risk factors in reducing prematurity and low birth weight.

TI  == in situ and non-invasive detection of specific bacterial species in oral biofilms using fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibodies.
AB  == noninvasive in situ detection of suspected cariogenic bacterial species within dental biofilms could facilitate monitoring of the dynamic change of oral microbial flora and assist in the assessment of the treatment efficacy of therapeutic agents. in this study, we explore the possibility to use three well-characterized monoclonal antibodies (mabs) against streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, and lactobacillus casei to identify these three important members of the oral microbial community in the complex environment of oral biofilms. these mabs, which were conjugated to different fluorescent labels and visualized with confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm), proved to be an useful tool to identify the three species of interest (s. mutans, a. naeslundii, and l.  casei) under various experimental conditions including in vitro and in vivo derived oral biofilms. manifold addition of the mabs on consecutive days did not  alter the biofilm structure thus allowing monitoring of the same biofilm over extended time periods. using this mab-based method the effect of sucrose challenge on the biofilm composition and the distribution of s. mutans, a. naeslundii, and l. casei were examined. s. mutans was found to be the predominant species under the various biofilm conditions tested. these studies indicate that  mabs based bacterial detection with clsm is a versatile tool which permits new insights into the ecology of oral biofilm development.

AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

AB  == the effect of probiotic cultures over known populations of staphylococcus aureus  inoculated in yogurt was studied; also the production and stability of its thermonuclease during yogurt storage was evaluated. in three different occasions, two different yogurt brands, one with additional probiotic cultures (lactobacillus casei and l. acidophilus), were inoculated with known populations  of s. aureus in high and low concentration (10(9) cfu/g and 10(7) cfu/g), respectively. these samples were stored for 28 days at 5 degrees c. every four days the count of lactic bacteria, s. aureus and ph were evaluated, according to  the methodology described in the compendium of methods for the microbiological examination of foods, vanderzant & splittstoesser. the presence of thermonuclease was determined using petrifilm for s. aureus from 3m company. the ph and lactic bacteria population were constant during the testing period. yogurt with additional probiotic cultures (high and low concentration) lowered the population of s. aureus to non detectable levels in 8 days; but, s. aureus could be cultured from yogurt without probiotics even after 24 days of incubation. same time, the presence of thermonuclease was positive in all tests; it was not affected by probiotics. the presence of thermonuclease is related to the production of s. aureus enterotoxin. this work emphasizes again the beneficial effects of probiotic cultures in yogurt over bacteria and the importance of keeping hygienic practices in order to avoid the contamination of food with s. aureus and the eventual production of its enterotoxin, since it is not affected by probiotics.

TI  == the antimicrobial activity of a dentin conditioner combined with antibacterial agents.
AB  == dental hand instruments are not efficient in removing all infected dentin when performing carious removal for minimal intervention techniques. the use of an antibacterial dentin conditioner may therefore be useful when restoring cavities  that have residual carious dentin. antibacterial agents--chlorhexidine hydrochloride, cetylpyridinium chloride, cetrimide, benzaikonium chloride and sodium hypochlorite, were added either to a dentin conditioner used for glass ionomer cements or distilled water at 1% concentration. dentin conditioning solutions at ph 2.5, 4.9 and 7.7 were also prepared, along with 1% aqueous thymol. using an agar diffusion test, 25 microl aliquots were examined for their  inhibitory effects on three cariogenic bacteria. after 24 hours, an agar pellet was extracted adjacent to the agar well and placed on a second inoculated agar plate to observe sustained inhibitory effects, after which this procedure was repeated one more time. antibacterial dentin conditioners showed significant inhibitory effect compared to the control over the three test periods (p<0.016).  the combination of dentin conditioners with antibacterial agents significantly reduced the inhibitory effect compared to the antibacterial aqueous solutions (p<0.016). one-percent aqueous thymol showed no inhibitory effect against the test bacteria. the cetrimide-dentin conditioner showed the greatest inhibitory effect against all three test bacteria over the three experimental periods (p<0.016). the inhibitory effect of antibacterial agents was significantly reduced when combined with a dentin conditioner. only the cetrimide-dentin conditioner combination produced significant inhibitory effects against all three test organisms.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of croton cajucara benth linalool-rich essential oil on artificial biofilms and planktonic microorganisms.
AB  == we have previously demonstrated that a linalool-rich essential oil from croton cajucara benth presents leishmanicidal activity. in the present study, we demonstrate that this essential oil inhibits the growth of reference samples of candida albicans, lactobacillus casei, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sobrinus, porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus mutans cell suspensions, all of them associated with oral cavity disease. the purified linalool fraction was only inhibitory for c. albicans. microbes of saliva specimens from human individuals with fixed orthodontic appliances, as well as the reference strains,  were used to construct an artificial biofilm which was exposed to linalool or to  the essential oil. as in microbial suspensions, the essential oil was toxic for all the microorganisms, while the purified linalool fraction mainly inhibited the growth of c. albicans. the compounds of the essential oil were separated by thin  layer chromatography and exposed to the above-cited microorganisms. in this analysis, the proliferation of the bacterial cells was inhibited by still uncharacterized molecules, and linalool was confirmed as the antifungal component of the essential oil. the effects of linalool on the cell biology of c. albicans  were evaluated by electron microscopy, which showed that linalool induced a reduction in cell size and abnormal germination. neither the crude essential oil  nor the purified linalool fraction is toxic to mammalian cells, which suggests that the essential oil or its purified components may be useful to control the microbial population in patients with fixed orthodontic appliances.

TI  == effectiveness of a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice on microbiological and inflammatory parameters.
AB  == according to the us surgeon general's report, "oral health in america," published in 2000, most adults in the united states show some degree of periodontal pathology, with severe periodontal diseases affecting about 14% of middle-aged adults. periodontal diseases are polymicrobial-induced inflammatory diseases, and they vary from mild gingival inflammation to severe deterioration of the periodontium, ie, loss of periodontal supportive tissues and, ultimately, tooth loss. new evidence shows that periodontal diseases may impact systemic health. for this reason, the maintenance of a healthy mouth is becoming increasingly important for the overall health of the body. this article summarizes laboratory  research conducted during the development of a novel, multibenefit, oral-care technology based on triclosan--a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent--and a polyvinylmethylether/maleic acid copolymer. this unique combination of agents is  found in colgate total, a clinically proven efficacious dentifrice for control of dental plaque and gingivitis. data are presented that demonstrate the unique antibacterial properties of this dentifrice: (1) a broad-spectrum antimicrobial profile; (2) the long-lasting retention of triclosan on hydroxyapatite and epithelial cells; and (3) molecular evidence of antibacterial activity against specific pathogens in clinical dental plaque. in addition, data are presented that demonstrate the anti-inflammatory effects of triclosan on specific cytokines, the interruption of inflammatory pathways, and the inhibition of bone  resorption. overall, these data support the multibenefit clinical effects of colgate total and suggest a plurality of mechanisms of action.

TI  == molecular quantification of lactic acid bacteria in fermented milk products using real-time quantitative pcr.
AB  == real-time quantitative pcr assays were developed for the absolute quantification  of lactic acid bacteria (lab) (streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, l. casei, l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, l. acidophilus and l. johnsonii) in fermented milk products. the results of molecular quantification and classic bacterial enumeration did not differ significantly with respect to s. thermophilus and the species of the l. casei group which were detected in the six commercial fermented products tested, thus showing that dna extraction was efficient and that genomic dna solutions were free of pcr inhibitors. for l. delbrueckii, the results of bacterial enumeration were generally lower by a factor 10 to 100 than those of pcr quantification, suggesting a loss of viability during storage of the dairy products at 1-8 degrees c for most of the strains in  this species. real-time quantitative assays enabled identification of the species of lactic acid bacterial strains initially present in commercial fermented milk products and their accurate quantification with a detection threshold of 10(3) cells per ml of product.

TI  == in vitro antibiotic susceptibility of lactobacilli isolated from commercial products containing active lactobacilli.
AB  == to survey the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of some commercially available lactobacillus, we collected four commercial products that contain active lactobacillus. we incubated individual product and identified these colonies by the methods of api50 ch test kit and rapid id 32a kit. strains of streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei were collected. by agar dilution method, each identified strain was inoculated to brucella blood agar-mic plates. each plate contained one of the following antibiotics with different concentrations: amoxicillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, vancomycin, erythromycin, rifampin, tetracyclin and penicillin g, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, cefmetazole, metronidazole, ampicillin/sulbactum, cefoxtin, etc. after incubation, the growth condition of each brucella blood agar-mic plate was observed and the breakpoint of each antibiotic to different lactobacillus products determined. the mics of amoxicillin, ampicillin/sulbactum and penicillin-g to all identified strains were < or =2 microg/ml and those of vancomycin, clindamycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, cefmetazole and cefoxtin for l. casei were >32 microg/ml. l. casei was more resistant to all the testing antibiotics than the other strains. according to the mics of the above antibiotics, proper active lactobacillus products could be chosen to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea in the pediatric field.

TI  == fluoride releasing materials: their anti-cariogenic properties tested in in vitro caries models.
AB  == the anti-cariogenic properties of three fluoride-releasing materials on root surfaces were evaluated using two different caries models. standardized cavities  were prepared in dentin specimens and restored with either glass-ionomer, resin-modified glass-ionomer, polyacid-modified resin composite or resin composite material. two groups of 56 specimens were demineralized using a microbial caries model for three days, while another 56 specimens were demineralized using a chemical demineralization model for three days. lesions around the restorations were measured with a confocal laser scanning microscope.  glass ionomers demonstrated significant anti-cariogenic properties when exposed to the chemical model. however, no significant anti-cariogenic properties were observed with the microbial caries model. in conclusion, the fluoride releasing materials showed different anti-cariogenic properties in root surfaces under the  different caries models, suggesting that caution should be exercised when trying  to extrapolate the results of in vitro studies to the clinical situation.

TI  == influence of camembert consumption on the composition and metabolism of intestinal microbiota: a study in human microbiota-associated rats.
AB  == the objective of the present study was to evaluate the consequence of camembert consumption on the composition and metabolism of human intestinal microbiota. camembert cheese was compared with milk fermented by yoghurt starters and lactobacillus casei as a probiotic reference. the experimental model was the human microbiota-associated (hm) rat. hm rats were fed a basal diet (hmb group),  a diet containing camembert made from pasteurised milk (hmcp group) or a diet containing fermented milk (hmfm group). the level of micro-organisms from dairy products was measured in faeces using cultures on a specific medium and pcr-temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis. the metabolic characteristics of the caecal microbiota were also studied: scfa, nh3, glycosidase and reductase activities, and bile acid degradations. the results showed that micro-organisms from cheese comprised 10(5)-10(8) bacteria/g faecal sample in the hmcp group. lactobacillus species from fermented milk were detected in hmfm rats. consumption of cheese and fermented milk led to similar changes in  bacterial metabolism: a decrease in azoreductase activity and nh3 concentration and an increase in mucolytic activities. however, specific changes were observed: in hmcp rats, the proportion of ursodeoxycholic resulting from chenodeoxycholic epimerisation was higher; in hmfm rats, alpha and beta-galactosidases were higher than in other groups and both azoreductases and nitrate reductases were lower. the results show that, as for fermented milk, camembert consumption did not greatly modify the microbiota profile or its major metabolic activities. ingested micro-organisms were able to survive in part during intestinal transit. these dairy products exert a potentially beneficial influence on intestinal metabolism.

TI  == bacterial desorption in water-saturated porous media in the presence of rhamnolipid biosurfactant.
AB  == we investigated the effects of transients in elution chemistry on bacterial desorption in water-saturated porous media. two typical gram-positive bacterial strains of lactobacillus casei and streptococcus mitis were used as the model bacteria in this research. these two strains were first deposited in the porous medium, after which the medium with deposited bacteria was flushed with rhamnolipid biosurfactant solutions with a step increase in concentrations, and pulse-type bacterial releases were obtained. bacterial desorption was quantified  from bacterial breakthrough curves. it was found that bacterial retention in silica sand corresponded to bacterial interaction free energies with silica sand  evaluated at the equilibrium distance, which were calculated based on independently determined bacterial, sediment and solution surface thermodynamic properties. with the increase in rhamnolipid biosurfactant concentrations, interactions between bacteria and silica sand decreased, and consequently less bacteria were retained. the decrease in interactions between bacteria and silica  sand with increasing rhamnolipid biosurfactant concentrations was attributed to a decrease in the solution electron acceptor parameter of the lewis acid/base component of surface tension, gamma3+. the increase in rhamnolipid biosurfactant  concentrations favored the decrease in solution gamma3+, and consequently decreased the interactions between bacteria and silica sand.

TI  == low ph-induced membrane fatty acid alterations in oral bacteria.
AB  == four oral bacterial strains, of which two are considered aciduric and two are considered acid-sensitive, were grown under glucose-limiting conditions in chemostats to determine whether their membrane fatty acid profiles were altered in response to environmental acidification. streptococcus gordonii dl1, as well as the aciduric strains s. salivarius 57.i, and lactobacillus casei 4646 increased the levels of mono-unsaturated membrane fatty acids. the non-aciduric strain s. sanguis 10904 did not alter its membrane composition in response to ph  values examined here. thus, in response to low ph, aciduric oral bacteria alter their membrane composition to contain increased levels of long-chained, mono-unsaturated fatty acids. this suggests that membrane fatty acid adaptation is a common mechanism utilized by bacteria to withstand environmental stress.

TI  == comparison of type 1 and type 2 cytokine production by mononuclear cells cultured with streptococcus mutans and selected other caries bacteria.
AB  == a feature of pulpal immune responses is the predominance of type 1 cytokine mrna  under shallow caries and a mixed (type 1/type 2) profile under deep caries. these results prompted an examination of the cytokine profiles induced by bacteria in shallow caries (streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus) and deep caries (lactobacillus casei, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and prevotella intermedia). all isolates induced interferon-gamma and interleukin-10, whereas interleukin-4 and interleukin-2 titers were low to undetectable. s. mutans was the most potent  and persistent interferon-gamma inducer. differences in interleukin-10 were apparent at low doses but were less dramatic, with l. casei the dominant producer. s. mutans induced substantially more interferon-gamma than interleukin-10 over all doses and time points, suggesting strong type 1 polarization. p. alactolyticus induced significantly more interleukin-10 than interferon-gamma at higher concentrations, suggesting polarization toward type 2. a similar amount of interferon-gamma and interleukin-10 induced by l. casei, a. viscosus, and p. intermedia reflected a mixed profile. a better understanding of  pulpal immune response to caries bacteria may enable us to develop an immune system-based pulp therapy in the future.

TI  == two distinct pathways for the formation of hydroxy fa from linoleic acid by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == twenty-three of 86 strains of lactic acid bacteria transformed linoleic acid into hydroxy fa. two distinct conversion pathways were in operation. two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus and a strain of pediococcus pentosaceus produced 13(s)-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid 113(s)-oh 18:11 and 10,13dihydroxyoctadecanoic  acid (10,13-oh 18:0) as main and minor products, respectively, whereas 13 strains, including l. casei subsp. casei, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, l. lactis subsp. cremoris, and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus produced 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid (10-oh 18:1). seven strains of l. plantarum converted linoleic acid to 10-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10-oh 18:0) through 10-oh 18:1. linoleic acid at 2 g/l was converted by l. acidophilus  ifo13951t to 1.3 g of 13(s)-oh 18:1 and 0.09 g of 10,13-oh 18:0 in 7 d. lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei jcm 1111 produced 10-oh 18:1 in 91% yield, and l. plantarum jcm 8341, 10-oh 18:0 in 59% yield from linoleic acid (2 g/l) under optimal conditions. to our knowledge, this is the first report on the  production of 13(s)-oh 18:1 by lactic acid bacteria other than ruminal bacteria,  and of 10,13-oh 18:0 by any bacteria.

TI  == xylitol inhibition of acid production and growth of mutans streptococci in the presence of various dietary sugars under strictly anaerobic conditions.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of xylitol on the  growth of and acid production by mutans streptococci in the presence of various dietary sugars, and the relationship between the inhibition and the accumulation  of xylitol 5-phosphate (x5p) under strictly anaerobic conditions like those in the deep layers of dental plaque. xylitol retarded the growth of mutans streptococci in the presence of glucose (g), galactose (gal), maltose (m), lactose (l) or sucrose (s) as an energy source, though the inhibition of growth on fructose (fr) was small. xylitol inhibited acid production by washed cells of  streptococci mutans from g, gal, m, l or s (12-83% inhibition). s. mutans accumulated x5p intracellularly through activity of the phosphoenolpyruvate-xylitol phosphotransferase system (pep-xylitol pts) when they fermented these sugars in the presence of xylitol. however, in the presence of fr, no inhibition of acid production was observed. in addition, the amounts of x5p during the fermentation of fr were smaller than those of other sugars in spite of the presence of pep-xylitol pts activity. these results suggest that along with the intracellular accumulation of x5p, xylitol decreases the growth and acid production of mutans streptococci in the presence of various dietary sugars except fr.

TI  == the acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  == the intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. in addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. the results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well  as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at ph 5.5 and 1% at ph 5.0, ph values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. at ph 5.0, members of the genus streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. the other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordinii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius and sstreptococcus sanguis. analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.

TI  == role of peptidoglycan subtypes in the pathogenesis of bacterial cell wall arthritis.
AB  == background: bacterial cell wall (cw) arthritis develops in susceptible strains of rats after a single intraperitoneal injection of the cw from certain bacterial species, both pathogenic and non-pathogenic. for the development of chronic bacterial cw arthritis, the structure of the bacterial peptidoglycan (pg) has been found to be decisive. objective: to define the role of pg subtypes in the pathogenesis of chronic bacterial cw arthritis. method: arthritis was induced with cws of lactobacillus plantarum, l casei b, l casei c, and l fermentum. gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to measure the presence of cw derived muramic acid in the liver and to determine pg subtypes. cws were also tested for  their resistance to lysozyme in vitro. results: these results and those published previously indicate that pgs of cws which induce chronic arthritis, no matter whether they were derived from strains of streptococcus, bifidobacterium, collinsella, or lactobacillus, all have lysine as the third amino acid of the pg  stem peptide, representing pg subtypes a3alpha and a4alpha. those strains which induce only transient acute arthritis or no arthritis at all do not have lysine in this position, resulting in different pg subtypes. conclusions: in vivo degradation of only those pgs with the subtypes a3alpha and a4alpha leads to the  occurrence of large cw fragments, which persist in tissue and have good proinflammatory ability. cws with other pg subtypes, even if they are lysozyme resistant, do not cause chronic arthritis, because the released fragments are not phlogistic. it is emphasised that a variety of microbial components not causing inflammation have been found in animal and human synovial tissue.

TI  == macrophage inflammatory protein-3alpha and beta-defensin-2 stimulate dentin sialophosphoprotein gene expression in human pulp cells.
AB  == macrophage inflammatory protein (mip)-3alpha and beta-defensin (bd)-2 have antimicrobial activity and chemotactic activity for immature dendritic cells, natural killer cells, and memory t cells. however, it remains unknown if the widespread effects of these peptides also include an influence on the differentiation of mesenchymal cells. pulp cells have the capacity to differentiate into odontoblasts and to form dentin. the aim of this study was to  determine if inflammatory leukocyte products influence the capacity of pulp cells to differentiate. dentin sialophosphoprotein (dspp) is a tooth-specific protein being expressed mostly by odontoblast cells. in the present study, we investigated effects of mip-3alpha and bd-2 on the dspp and osteopontin (opn) gene expression in cultures of human pulp-derived fibroblastic cells (hp cells).  hp cells expressed mrna for the cc chemokine receptor (ccr) 6 to which both mip-3alpha and bd-2 can bind. real-time pcr showed that mip-3alpha and bd-2 significantly increased dspp mrna levels, although bd-2 increased dspp mrna levels less than mip-3alpha. mip-3alpha and bd-2 increased opn mrna levels very slightly. mip-3alpha and bd-2 possessed antibacterial activity against streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus casei, which are involved in caries, although the antibacterial activity of mip-3alpha was lower than that of bd-2. these findings suggest the mip-3alpha and bd-2 have the ability to stimulate odontoblast differentiation in addition to their more traditional role in inflammation and have potential in the removal of bacteria in infected soft dentin and pulp tissues.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of commercial annatto extracts against selected pathogenic, lactic acid, and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  == annatto preparations are used to impart distinctive flavor and color to foods and are a primary colorant in dairy foods such as cheese and butter. there are several reports indicating that certain fractions of the annatto plant have biological activities against microorganisms of significance in food fermentation, food preservation, and human health. however, little is reported describing the nature of the antimicrobial compound(s) or their potential presence in commercial annatto colorant preparations. this study was conducted to determine whether commonly available annatto extracts are capable of influencing  the outgrowth of selected lactic acid, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms. disk diffusion and tube macrodilution techniques were used to determine the mics  and mbcs of double-strength water-soluble annatto extracts. standard antibiotic disks were used as controls for the disk diffusion assay. the results demonstrate that annatto has an inhibitory effect on bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, and staphylococcus aureus, with mics of 0.08, 0.31, and 0.16% (vol/vol) and diameters of inhibition of 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16 mm, respectively. a concentration of 0.63% (vol/vol) inhibited the growth of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, lactococcus lactis, and paenibacillus polymyxa. the mics for listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus  durans were 1.25 and 2.5% (vol/vol), respectively. no activity was detected against lactobacillus plantarum, bifidobacterium bifidum, yeasts, or selected gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == a primer design strategy named codehop (consensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primer) for amplification of distantly related sequences was used to detect the priming glycosyltransferase (gt) gene in strains of the lactobacillus casei group. each hybrid primer consisted of a short 3' degenerate  core based on four highly conserved amino acids and a longer 5' consensus clamp region based on six sequences of the priming gt gene products from exopolysaccharide (eps)-producing bacteria. the hybrid primers were used to detect the priming gt gene of 44 commercial isolates and reference strains of lactobacillus rhamnosus, l. casei, lactobacillus zeae, and streptococcus thermophilus. the priming gt gene was detected in the genome of both non-eps-producing (eps(-)) and eps-producing (eps(+)) strains of l. rhamnosus. the sequences of the cloned pcr products were similar to those of the priming gt  gene of various gram-negative and gram-positive eps(+) bacteria. specific primers designed from the l. rhamnosus rw-9595m gt gene were used to sequence the end of  the priming gt gene in selected eps(+) strains of l. rhamnosus. phylogenetic analysis revealed that lactobacillus spp. form a distinctive group apart from other lactic acid bacteria for which gt genes have been characterized to date. moreover, the sequences show a divergence existing among strains of l. rhamnosus  with respect to the terminal region of the priming gt gene. thus, the pcr approach with consensus-degenerate hybrid primers designed with codehop is a practical approach for the detection of similar genes containing conserved motifs in different bacterial genomes.

TI  == influence of the oral administration of lactic acid bacteria on iga producing cells associated to bronchus.
AB  == intestinal, respiratory and genitourinary mucosal surfaces are the most important routes of entry for microbial pathogens. the stimulus of the mucosal immunity is  not easy because the trigger keys for the activation do not follow the ones of the systemic immune response. in previous works we have demonstrated that some lactic acid bacteria (lab), when orally administered, can induce an enhance of the gut immune response. taking into account the concept of a common mucosal response, we studied the effect of orally administered mice with lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactococcus lactis on the iga secreting cells associated to bronchus. as shown before, oral immunostimulation with lab induced an increase of the iga* cells at intestinal level by a dose depending effect. in this study it is also showed that the lab assayed, with exception of l. acidophilus, were able to enhance iga+ cells at bronchial level,  being also this effect dose dependent. the increment induced by some lab in the number of iga+ cells on the mucosa surface of the lower respiratory tract may be  very important to prevent bronchus diseases.

TI  == differences in antimicrobial activity of four commercial 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthrinse formulations: an in vitro contact test and salivary bacterial counts study.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of four commercial 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthrinses. material and methods: the in vitro antimicrobial activity test consisted in a modified contact test where 20 selected bacterial species were tested during 1 min with each test product. after the contact, the inoculum was cultured, and the results were expressed in terms of survival/resistance and the percentage of survival as compared to a saline control. the in vivo test consisted of a double-blind, randomized, crossover salivary bacterial counts study. 10 volunteers rinsed during 1 min with each tested product. saliva samples were obtained before rinsing, and after 5 min, and 1, 3, 5 and 7 h. these samples were cultured both aerobically and anaerobically.  percentages of survival, in regard to baseline, were calculated for each time point. comparisons among products were tested using anova and selected paired t-test. results: the in vitro contact test showed no survival in any tested species with chx+cpc, while three species (lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mitis and peptostreptococcus micros) were resistant to the other three products.  chx and chx+naf demonstrated additional resistant species (three and four species, respectively). the in vivo salivary bacterial counts test showed higher  reductions of chx+cpc and chx+alc in aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, lasting for  5 h. significant differences were detected at multiple time points, when these two products were compared both with the control and the other tested products. conclusion: important differences in activity, among 0.12% chx products, were detected by both in vitro and in vivo tests. the formulation with alcohol was more active than those without alcohol, excepting the formulation with chx+cpc, in which the reformulation and addition of cpc not only compensate but rather increase the antimicrobial activity.

TI  == comparison of antibacterial activity of simplified adhesive systems.
AB  == purpose: to determine and compare the intrinsic antibacterial activity of commercially available simplified adhesive systems. materials and methods: the antibacterial activity of five self-etching/priming one-step adhesives and three  priming/bonding adhesives against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei, and  actinomyces viscosus was assessed by the agar disc-diffusion test and determination of the minimum inhibitory/bactericidal concentration (mic/mbc). twenty microl of each adhesive was impregnated into a paper disc and placed on an agar plate inoculated with a bacterial suspension, with or without light-irradiation. the size of inhibition zones produced around the specimens was measured after 48 hours of incubation. the mic values were measured by serial microdilution assays, visually examining the growth of bacteria after incubation  with each adhesive for 24-48 hours. the subcultures were made on bhi agar plates  from the wells showing no visible growth of bacteria, and the mbc values were determined based on production of colonies. two primers in two-step self-etching  systems and an experimental primer containing chlorhexidine were tested for reference. the results of disc-diffusion tests were analyzed by anova and fisher's plsd test. results: the size of inhibition zones produced by adhesives varied among the brands. none of the available commercial adhesives showed significant inhibition against all three of the bacterial species tested. light-irradiation reduced the size of inhibition zones for a few materials, but a similar trend to the effectiveness of non-irradiated specimens was observed. the  antibacterial activity of commercial products determined in terms of mic/mbc values were different from the results by disc-diffusion tests. the self-etching  adhesives with low ph were not necessarily more effective than priming/bonding solutions, and no significant relationships between the acidity and antibacterial effects were found. compared with commercial products, an experimental primer containing chlorhexidine produced significantly larger inhibition zones against all species (p < 0.05) and exhibited greater bacteriostatic/bactericidal activity, demonstrating lower mic/mbc values.

TI  == cell wall attachment of a widely distributed peptidoglycan binding domain is hindered by cell wall constituents.
AB  == the c-terminal region (ca) of the major autolysin acma of lactococcus lactis contains three highly similar repeated regions of 45 amino acid residues (lysm domains), which are separated by nonhomologous sequences. the ca domain could be  deleted without destroying the cell wall-hydrolyzing activity of the enzyme in vitro. this acma derivative was capable neither of binding to lactococcal cells nor of lysing these cells while separation of the producer cells was incomplete.  the ca domain and a chimeric protein consisting of ca fused to the c terminus of  msa2, a malaria parasite surface antigen, bound to lactococcal cells specifically via ca. the fusion protein also bound to many other gram-positive bacteria. by chemical treatment of purified cell walls of l. lactis and bacillus subtilis, peptidoglycan was identified as the cell wall component interacting with ca. immunofluorescence studies showed that binding is on specific locations on the surface of l. lactis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus, b. subtilis, lactobacillus sake, and lactobacillus casei cells. based on these studies, we propose that lysm-type repeats bind to peptidoglycan and that binding is hindered by other cell wall constituents, resulting in localized binding of acma. lipoteichoic acid is a candidate hindering component. for l. lactis sk110,  it is shown that lipoteichoic acids are not uniformly distributed over the cell surface and are mainly present at sites where no msa2ca binding is observed.

TI  == intestinal pathway of internalisation of lactic acid bacteria and gut mucosal immunostimulation.
AB  == the induction of the gut mucosal immune response is dependent on the antigen interacting with the m cells of peyer's patches and with the immune cells associated with this lymphoid organ. in previous studies we showed that the mucosal immunostimulation by lab varied depending upon the strain being studied.  some of them increased the inflammatory immune response and others enhanced the level of secretory antibody (s-iga). our aim was to determine the pathway of the  internalisation of lab strains in the intestine, to provide a basis for understing the different behaviour exhibited by them. the presence of lab on peyer's patches or in the immune cells associated with the villi of small intestine was determined using fluorescein-labelled bacteria and by transmission  electron microscopy. mice were dosed orally by intubation, with 10<sup>1</sup> cells of labelled single strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus. for electron microscopy studies unlabelled bacteria were used. histological preparations of the small and large intestine were performed 1 hour  after administration of the bacteria. fluorescent bacteria of l. casei and s. thermophilus were found only in peyer's patches while l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and l. acidophilus were observed in peyer's patches and in the small intestine. l. acidophilus was also found in the large intestine. we confirmed these findings by electron microscopy. we determined that for l. casei the pathway of internalisation was via the m and fae cells of peyer's patches, while  for s. thermophilus, l. acidophilus and l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus the interaction with the immune cells of peyer's patches was through the follicle associated epithelium (fae). l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and l. acidophilus also interacted with the epithelial cells of the small intestine and l. acidophilus with epithelial cells of the large intestine. these results suggest that the different effects of lab on the mucosal immunostimulation, are related to the different pathways of gut internalisation used to take contact with the immune cells associated with the lamina propria intestinal.

TI  == inhibitory effects on selected oral bacteria of antibacterial agents incorporated in a glass ionomer cement.
AB  == the objectives of the study were to investigate the antimicrobial efficacy, over  time, of combining antibacterial agents with a glass ionomer cement (gic). this was assessed using an agar diffusion test. chlorhexidine hydrochloride, cetylpyridinium chloride, cetrimide and benzalkonium chloride were added to fuji  ix gic at 0, 1, 2 and 4% w/w. antibacterial-gic specimens were placed onto agar plates inoculated with one of six bacterial species (streptococcis, lactobacillus, and actinomyces, two each) and the area of inhibition calculated after 24 h incubation. the experiment was repeated weekly and at week 11 the surface of the specimen was abraded prior to replacing on inoculated agar plates. control specimens of the gic produced no bacterial inhibition. the antibacterial-gic combination specimens showed significant inhibition which decreased at different rates over the test period. resurfacing of the specimens showed a dramatic increase of antibacterial action similar to levels produced on  week 1. ct-gic showed the greatest (p < 0.005) inhibitory effect throughout the experimental period for 4 out of 6 test bacteria. the addition of antibacterial agents to fuji ix creates a gic material with significant antimicrobial action in vitro which is dependent on concentration and type of antibacterial agent, and appears to be associated primarily with a release of the antibacterial from the surface layer of the specimen.

TI  == feasibility studies to control acute diarrhoea in children by feeding fermented milk preparations actimel and indian dahi.
AB  == the aim of this work was to study feasibility of diarrhoea control in children (6 months to 5 y of age) by feeding fermented milk preparations. the design used was a randomized controlled clinical trial and the study was carried out at the delhi university college hospital providing tertiary care, and a nearby community centre nand nagri, a resettlement colony in east delhi. children suffering from acute diarrhoea (75 patients from the hospital and 75 from the community) were allocated to three groups by double-blind technique. group 1 was given a fermented milk, actimel, containing 10(8) of each lactobacillus casei dn-114001,  lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus per gram. group 2 was given indian dahi (lf 40) containing 10(8) of each lactococcus lactis, lactococcus lactis cremoris and leuconostac mesenteroides cremoris per gram. group 3 was given ultra-heat-treated yoghurt preparation (no live bacteria). actimel was also used as a starter to prepare the curd in order to study the preventive effect of diarrhoea in children in a community. in the hospital study  indian dahi and actimel administration reduced mean duration of diarrhoea by 0.3  and 0.6 day (p<0.001), respectively. the corresponding figures in the community study were 0.2 and 0.5 day (p<0.05), respectively. the families using actimel as  a starter showed a reduction in diarrhoeal morbidity episodes by 40% of the children tested in a 3 month follow-up. in conclusion, actimel, fermented milk containing lactobacillus casei dn-114001, and indian dahi can significantly reduce the duration of diarrhoea in children; the former preparation being superior.

TI  == interaction of lactic acid bacteria with the gut immune system.
AB  == health claims of lactic acid bacteria (lab) used in functional foods and pharmaceutical preparations are based on the capacity of these microorganisms to  stimulate the host immune system. in this study, the antigenic effect of lab (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus) on the gut immune system of balb/c mice was evaluated. a dose-dependent increase of the bcl2 protein was observed with all lab assayed. furthermore, the analysis of cytokine-producing cells in the lamina propria of gut showed that tnfalpha and infgamma values, determined in macrophages cultured from peyer patches, were enhanced for all the lab assayed. an important increase of interleukins il-10 and il-4 was observed mainly in mice  fed with lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus or lactobacillus casei, while  a significant induction of il-2 and il-12 was only observed with l. acidophilus (p<0.01). these effects were dose dependent. the role of produced cytokines in the balance th1/th2 was determined by a systemic antibody response against parenterally injected ovoalbumin. l. casei, l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and l. acidophilus enhanced the igg1 response favouring th2 balance, while l. acidophilus also increased the igg2a response inducing th1 balance. s. thermophilus did not influence the balance th1/th2. our studies showed that lactic acid bacteria induce distinct mucosal cytokine profiles showing different  adjuvant capacity among them. thus, selection of probiotic strain with immunological properties must be well defined to influence cytokine expression that favour the claimed immune response.

TI  == effects of nitrite and nitrate on the growth and acidogenicity of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == it is hypothesised that exogenous nitrite acidified by metabolic products of acidogenic bacteria in the mouth will be converted to products which inhibit growth of the bacteria in question which contribute to dental caries. objectives: the aims of this study were (1) to test the activity of both sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite at differing concentrations on the ability of streptococcus mutans to lower the ph of its surroundings and hence (2) to determine whether either nitrate or nitrite might be bactericidal or bacteriostatic against s. mutans. methods: s. mutans nctc 10449(t) was cultured in a liquid medium to which either  sodium nitrate or sodium nitrite was added to a final concentration of 0.0, 0.2,  2.0, 20 or 200 mm, of which the first acted as a test substance negative control. after 24 h, the cultures were streaked onto agar to test for growth and the remaining culture used for ph measurement. the mann-whitney u-test was used for statistical comparison of ph values. results: nitrite at concentrations of 20 and 200 mm had a highly significant inhibitory effect (p < 0.001) on the ability of s. mutans nctc 10449(t) to lower ph. moreover, bacteria that had been subjected to these levels of nitrite were unable to recover on solid medium. nitrate had no such effect on either the growth of the bacteria or on their ability to lower ph. conclusions: it is concluded that nitrite, at final concentrations of either 20 or 200 mm, is both bactericidal and anti-acidogenic with respect to s. mutans, while lower concentrations of nitrite and all concentrations of nitrate are ineffective. nitrite might be worthy of consideration as a mouth-rinse constituent.

TI  == the dilemma of phage taxonomy illustrated by comparative genomics of sfi21-like siphoviridae in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the complete genome sequences of two dairy phages, streptococcus thermophilus phage 7201 and lactobacillus casei phage a2, are reported. comparative genomics reveals that both phages are members of the recently proposed sfi21-like genus of siphoviridae, a widely distributed phage type in low-gc-content gram-positive bacteria. graded relatedness, the hallmark of evolving biological systems, was observed when different sfi21-like phages were compared. across the structural module, the graded relatedness was represented by a high level of dna sequence similarity or protein sequence similarity, or a shared gene map in the absence of sequence relatedness. this varying range of relatedness was found within sfi21-like phages from a single species as demonstrated by the different prophages harbored by lactococcus lactis strain il1403. a systematic dot plot analysis with 11 complete l. lactis phage genome sequences revealed a clear separation of all temperate phages from two classes of virulent phages. the temperate lactococcal phages share dna sequence homology in a patchwise fashion over the nonstructural gene cluster. with respect to structural genes, four dna homology groups could be defined within temperate l. lactis phages. closely related structural modules for all four dna homology groups were detected in phages from streptococcus or listeria, suggesting that they represent distinct evolutionary lineages that have not uniquely evolved in l. lactis. it seems reasonable to base phage taxonomy on data from comparative genomics. however, the peculiar modular nature of phage evolution creates ambiguities in the definition  of phage taxa by comparative genomics. for example, depending on the module on which the classification is based, temperate lactococcal phages can be classified as a single phage species, as four distinct phage species, or as two if not three different phage genera. we propose to base phage taxonomy on comparative genomics of a single structural gene module (head or tail genes). this partially phylogeny-based taxonomical system still mirrors some aspects of the current international committee on taxonomy in virology classification system. in this system the currently sequenced lactococcal phages would be grouped into five genera: c2-, sk1, sfi11-, r1t-, and sfi21-like phages.

TI  == the evaluation of mixtures of yeast and potato extracts in growth media for biomass production of lactic cultures.
AB  == the effectiveness of yeast extracts (ye) and potato extracts (pe) to promote growth of seven lactic cultures was evaluated by automated spectrophotometry (as). two aspects of the growth curve were analysed: (1) maximum biomass obtained (using odmax) and (2) highest specific growth rate mu(max)) eleven lots from the  same pe-manufacturing process were examined for lot-to-lot variability. the odmax values of three of the seven strains were significantly affected by lot source, but mu(max) was not significantly affected. the growth of bacteria was systematically lower in base medium containing 100% pe than in base medium containing 100% ye for both odmax or mu(max) data, which could be related to the  lower content in nitrogen-based compounds in pe. in as assays, highest od values  for lactobacillus casei eq28, lactobacillus rhamnosus r-011, lactobacillus plantarum eq12, and streptococcus thermophilus r-083 were obtained with a mixture of pe and ye. fermentations (2 l) were also carried out to determine the accuracy of as to predict biomass levels obtained under fermentation trials. in these fermentations, replacement of 50% ye with pe was shown to enable good growth of s. thermophilus. with l. rhamnosus r-011, a high correlation (r2 = 0.95) was found between odmax data obtained in the as assays and that of the 2-l bioreactor when the same growth medium was used for both series of fermentations. however, as was not as efficient when industrial media were used for the bioreactor assays. the relationship was still good for odmax between as data and that of the bioreactor data with l. rhamnosus r-011 in industrial lbs medium (r2 = 0.87), but was very poor with the s. thermophilus r-083 on rosell #43 industrial medium (r2  = 0.33). since pe cost 40% less than ye, there are strong economic advantages in  considering such a partial replacement of ye by pe.

TI  == suppression of antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation by gram-positive bacterial cell walls.
AB  == it is largely unknown how bacterial cell walls (bcw) modulate human immune responses. in the present work the effect of gram-positive bcw on lymphocyte proliferation responses towards several microbial antigens (ag) or mitogens was studied. gram-positive bcw were derived from four indigenous bacterial strains and from one pathogen (streptococcus pyogenes). all bcw preparations used non-specifically suppressed the proliferation responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) against bacterial and viral ag, but not against mitogens. both lymphocytes and macrophages or their secreted products mediated the suppressive effects of bcw, which were not il-10 dependent. furthermore, the  expression of hla-dr and cd86 on monocytes/macrophages was downregulated by bcw.  unlike in lps-induced suppression, the cd14 pathway was not used by bcw of lactobacillus casei (l.c.). the observed results indicate that gram-positive bcw  suppress antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation through several mechanisms. this non-specific immunosuppression might be a general function of bcw in the bacteria-host interaction, being of importance for bacterial survival and pathogenicity.

AB  == objective: to study whether enterobacteria and gram-positive bacterial cell walls (bcw) derivedfrom normal intestinal microbiota are involved in the etiopathogenesis of early rheumatoid arthritis (ra). methods: peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) and synovial fluid mononuclear cells (sfmc) were isolatedfrom patients with early ra (the average duration of 5 months) and the controls (other types of inflammatory arthritis). the mononuclear cell proliferation and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) responses to heat-killed salmonella enteritidis (se). yersinia enterocolitica (ye), and escherichia coli (ec), and to gram-positive bcw derived from four common intestinal indigenous bacteria, eubacterium aerofaciens (ea), eubacterium limosum (el), lactobacillus casei (lc), and lactobacillus fermentum (lf), and a bcw derived from a pathogen, streptococcus pyogenes (sp) were investigated. results:  39% or 56% of patients with early ra showed significant proliferation responses by pbmc or sfmc against enterobacteria, respectively. in other types of arthritis, corresponding figures were 59% or 66%. when bcw were used as antigens, 8.1% or 23% of patients with early ra showed proliferation responses by pbmc or sfmc, respectively. in other types of arthritis the corresponding figures were 7.5% or 35%, respectively. however, tnf-alpha production by sfmc stimulated by ea bcw, se, ye or ec, was significantly higher in early ra than in other types of arthritis. conclusion: these results suggest that sfmc reacting with enterobacteria or bcw exist in some patients with early ra, but also in other types of inflammatory arthritis. intestinal bacterial agents may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of ra, but the effect appears to be non-specific.

TI  == evolution of carbohydrate fraction in carbonated fermented milks as affected by beta-galactosidase activity of starter strains.
AB  == the influence of carbonation on the evolution of lactose, galactose and glucose in fermented milks with added probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus acidophilus and/or bifidobacterium bifidum) was evaluated and related to beta-galactosidase activity of starter strains. during incubation and  first days of refrigeration, lactose hydrolysis resulting in the liberation of galactose and glucose occurred in ct (streptococcus thermophilus/lb. casei), at (str. thermophilus/lb. acidophilus) and abt fermented milks (str. thermophilus/lb. acidophilus/bifid. bifidum). levels of galactose were higher than those of glucose and could be related to the preferential consumption of glucose by actively growing bacteria. through the incubation, lactose and monosaccharide levels were not affected by milk carbonation. however, during refrigerated storage the presence of this gas was associated with slightly lower  content of lactose and higher levels of galactose and glucose in at and abt products but not in ct fermented milks. through the refrigeration galactose was moderately utilised by lb. acidophilus in at products whereas the presence of bifid. bifidum seems to prevent the consumption of this sugar in abt fermented milks. glucose remained constant, with minor variations in ct products but a continuous increase of this sugar occurred in carbonated at and abt fermented milks during storage. beta-galactosidase activity displayed by str. thermophilus  strains was similar at ph 6.5 (initial ph of non-carbonated samples) and ph 6.3 (initial ph of carbonated samples) whereas lb. acidophilus laa3 showed greater beta-galactosidase activity at ph 6.3 than at higher ph values. thus, the enhanced metabolic activity of lb. acidophilus caused by the low initial ph of carbonated milk also promoted higher cellular beta-galactosidase activity that could have released greater amounts of galactose and glucose from lactose in at and abt fermented milks through the refrigerated period. in ct fermented milks, similar beta-galactosidase activity levels of str. thermophilus at ph 6.5 and 6.3 together with the absence of beta-galactosidase activity in lb. casei could explain the lack of differences on glucose and galactose content between carbonated and non-carbonated samples.

TI  == lack of therapeutic effect of a specially designed yogurt for the eradication of  helicobacter pylori infection.
AB  == background: current antibiotic treatment for helicobacter pylori infection is often associated with frequent adverse effects and resistance to antibiotics. alternative treatment methods to control h. pylori infection are needed. some specific strains of lactic acid bacteria (probiotics) in dairy products are known to inhibit the growth of h. pylori in vitro. a clinical trial was conducted to see the efficacy of a specially designed yogurt product containing specific probiotics on the eradication of h. pylori. method: the yogurt was prepared using three lactobacillus spp. (l. acidophilus and l. casei) and one commercial starter culture (l. acidophilus, l. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus). all these cultures were previously evaluated, and found to have strong in vitro inhibitory  effects on the growth of h. pylori. twenty-seven asymptomatic women positive for  h. pylori on gastric biopsy and 13c urea breath test were recruited, and administered 175 ml of the yogurt three times a day for 30 days. the 13c urea breath test was administered again, one month after stopping the yogurt treatment to detect the presence of h. pylori. results: in 26 of 27 subjects, the urea breath test values remained positive, indicating that the consumption of the yogurt had no effect on the eradication of h. pylori. conclusion: although the designed fermented milk containing lactobacilli is very effective in the inhibition of h. pylori growth in vitro, eradication of this infection in humans  is difficult to achieve by consuming this product.

TI  == inhibitory effect of zncl(2) on glycolysis in human oral microbes.
AB  == although the inhibition of bacterial glycolysis by zinc ions might be expected to moderate dental caries, there has not been a comparison of the effect of zn on different organisms under both fixed ph and free-fall conditions. here, the effect of zncl(2) on streptococcus salivarius, strep. mutans, strep. sobrinus, actinomyces naeslundii and lactobacillus casei, as well as on mixtures of oral organisms outgrown from human dental plaque and saliva, was surveyed. ph-stat experiments were performed at ph 7, 6 or 5 in a solution containing 5% glucose and a suspension of the test organism; ph-fall experiments started at ph 7. in both cases, acid production was monitored for 60 min, when samples were taken for zn and lactate determinations. under ph-stat conditions, acid production was inhibited by zn most strongly in strep. sobrinus and strep. salivarius. in terms  of total acid production averted, however, the effect of zn under both ph-stat and ph-fall conditions was clearly greatest with strep. salivarius. a. naeslundii was inhibited the least strongly under ph-stat conditions. cultured oral organism mixtures were more sensitive to moderate concentrations of zinc (0.2-0.3mm initial concentration) than were the single species to higher concentrations (1mm). packed cell layers responded to zn quite differently from suspensions, the ph often falling in the presence of 1mm zn at a rate similar to the no zn control. as streptococci had the highest acidogenesis rates in both ph-stat and ph-fall experiments, it seems likely that inhibition of acid production with these organisms would be of more value in moderating caries than the inhibition of less acidogenic organisms such as a. naeslundii.

TI  == the predominant microflora of nursing caries lesions.
AB  == the predominant microflora recovered from infected dentine of 52 carious teeth from 14 children with nursing caries was determined using both selective and non-selective media for the isolation of specific genera and acidified media (ph  5.2) to isolate the predominant aciduric microorganisms, and compared with the microflora of sound enamel surfaces in caries-free children. streptococcus mutans formed a significantly greater proportion of the lesion flora while streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus gordonii formed a significantly greater proportion of the plaque flora from sound tooth surfaces. the proportions of actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces odontolyticus were significantly greater in the plaque samples than in the lesion samples. actinomyces israelii formed 18.2% of the flora from the lesions, but was not isolated from the plaque  samples. the proportions of candida albicans, lactobacillus spp. and veillonella  spp. were also significantly greater in the carious dentine than in the plaque samples. the most frequently isolated lactobacilli were lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the predominant aciduric flora was s. oralis, s. mutans and a. israelii and these taxa were also isolated  from a similar proportion of the lesions at ph 7.0. strains of s. mutans, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. rhamnosus isolated from individual carious teeth were  genotyped using pcr-based methods. each species was genotypically heterogeneous and different genotypes were recovered from different carious teeth in the same child. these data indicate that the microflora of lesions in the same child is microbiologically diverse and support a non-specific aetiology for nursing caries in which the physiological characteristics of the infecting flora, not its composition, is the major determinant underlying the disease process.

TI  == specific iga to lactic acid bacteria in feces of children consuming milk fermented by yoghurt symbiosis and lactobacillus casei (danone strain dn 114 001).
AB  == an immunoreactive role of lactic acid bacteria established in animals has seldom  been investigated in humans. in a large-scale clinical study, children from day-care centers received either yoghurt (y), milk fermented by yoghurt symbiosis and lactobacillus casei (dn 114 001) (yc), or gelified milk (gm) as diet supplements during two 30-day supplementation periods separated by one 30-day period without supplementation. feces samples were collected before, during, and  after the 2nd supplementation period. proteins were extracted in a buffer containing enzymatic inhibitors. iga levels were assessed and adjusted to the weight of feces samples. specific iga to lactic acid bacteria strains (streptococcus thermophilus 8901a, 8902a; lactobacillus bulgaricus; lactobacillus casei) present in y and yc were assayed in elisa and adjusted to individual iga levels. mean levels of fecal iga were within reported ranges for pediatric populations of similar age. iga levels decreased significantly but transiently in children receiving y, and increased significantly in children receiving gm, but did not vary in the group of children who were given yc. specific iga to the 4 strains tested increased significantly during the supplementation period only in  the group of children receiving gm, while it was transient and not significant in children receiving yc. no variation was noted in children given y specific iga to lactic acid bacteria can be assayed in feces. supplementation with fermented milks might induce a mucosal tolerance to environmental flora.

TI  == evolution of the lactic acid bacterial community during malt whisky fermentation: a polyphasic study.
AB  == the development of the lactic acid bacterial community in a commercial malt whisky fermentation occurred in three broad phases. initially, bacteria were inhibited by strong yeast growth. fluorescence microscopy and environmental scanning electron microscopy revealed, in this early stage, both cocci and rods that were at least partly derived from the wort and yeast but also stemmed from the distillery plant. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of partial 16s rrna genes and sequence analysis revealed cocci related to streptococcus thermophilus or saccharococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus brevis, and lactobacillus fermentum. the middle phase began 35 to 40 h after yeast inoculation and was characterized by exponential growth of lactobacilli and residual yeast metabolism. lactobacillus casei or lactobacillus paracasei, l. fermentum, and lactobacillus ferintoshensis were detected in samples of fermenting wort examined by dgge during this stage. bacterial growth was accompanied by the accumulation of acetic and lactic acids and the metabolism of  residual maltooligosaccharides. by 70 h, two new pcr bands were detected on dgge  gels, and the associated bacteria were largely responsible for the final phase of the fermentation. the bacteria were phylogenetically related to lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii, and strains similar to the former had  previously been recovered from malt whisky fermentations in japan. these were probably obligately homofermentative bacteria, required malt wort for growth, and could not be cultured on normal laboratory media, such as mrs. their metabolism during the last 20 to 30 h of fermentation was associated with yeast death and autolysis and further accumulation of lactate but no additional acetate.

AB  == bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of  ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.

TI  == lactobacillus casei acquires the binding activity to fibronectin by the expression of the fibronectin binding domain of streptococcus pyogenes on the cell surface.
AB  == fibronectin binding domain was expressed on the cell surface of lactobacillus casei strain shirota which hardly adheres to fibronectin. dna for the fibronectin binding domain of the sfbl gene, which encodes a fibronectin binding protein of streptococcus pyogenes atcc 21059, was amplified with polymerase chain reaction,  cloned into a surface display vector psak332, and introduced into l. casei. the fibronectin binding domain was expressed as a fusion protein consisting of staphylokinase of staphylococcus aureus and the anchor sequence of cell wall-associated 763 proteinase of lactococcus lactis ncdo 763. the fibronectin binding ability of the resulting l. casei was confirmed with western blot analysis, immunoelectron microscopic analysis, and adherence to fibroblast cells. these results indicate that l. casei has acquired a new phenotype to bind fibronectin upon the expression of the fibronectin binding domain on the cell surface. this l. casei also shows binding affinity to fibrinogen, indicating that fibronectin binding domain is involved in the binding to fibrinogen as well.

TI  == inhibitory effects of moabs against a surface protein antigen in real-time adherence in vitro and recolonization in vivo of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == a surface protein antigen (pac) of streptococcus mutans, particularly the a-region of the molecule, has been reported to interact with salivary components  on the tooth surface. it might be a candidate antigen inducing the production of  antibodies against the adherence of s. mutans to the tooth surface. we investigated the effects of monoclonal antibodies (moabs) obtained by immunization of synthetic pac peptides that completely correspond to the amino acid sequence of part of the a-region. these moabs recognize several core b-cell  epitopes in the sequence. two (kh5 and sh2) of these antibodies reacted with both s. mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, but not with streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, porphyromonas gingivalis or lactobacillus casei. they clearly inhibited the real-time adherence of s. mutans to salivary components in  a biosensor. kh5, which showed a real-time inhibition (71%), also significantly prevented the recolonization of s. mutans on the tooth surface in rats. these results suggested that the core b-cell epitope (-y---l--y----) recognized by kh5  was the essential sequence in the antigenic epitopes of pac protein recognized specifically by the inhibitory antibody. therefore, the amino acid residues were  found to be important in the initial attachment of s. mutans to the tooth surface. these results provide for the mechanism of pac molecule in the initial attachment of s. mutans on the tooth surface and more effective designs for the removal of s. mutans and s. sobrinus from the oral cavity.

TI  == the effect of oral bacteria on candida albicans germ-tube formation.
AB  == a total of eight bacterial isolates belonging to six species, and a select group  of 12 oral candida albicans isolates, were used to study the effect of bacteria on germ-tube formation. briefly, each bacterial suspension (10(5-6) cells/ml) was mixed with a c. albicans suspension (10(7) cells/ml) and incubated at 37 degrees  c for 90 min with bovine serum, and the percentage germ-tube-positive candida cells was quantified using a haemocytometer, under light microscopy. in general,  out of eight bacteria, streptococcus sanguis sk21a, streptococcus salivarius sk56, escherichia coli atcc 25922, and s. salivarius obu3 suppressed germ-tube formation to varying degrees, with different c albicans isolates. porphyromonas gingivalis pg 50, lactobacillus casei atcc 7469 and prevotella intermedia obu4 elicited significant enhancement of germ-tube formation, whereas s. sanguis obu 2 had no effect. e. coli atcc 25922 was the only organism to show statistically significant suppression of germ-tube formation (p=0.0312). a significant increase in the germ tube production of c. albicans isolated from hiv-infected compared with hiv-free individuals was also noted. the current results tend to suggest that commensal and transient oral bacterial populations may selectively influence the differential expression of germ-tube-forming ability of c. albicans isolates.

TI  == thin layer chromatographic determination of organic acids for rapid identification of bifidobacteria at genus level.
AB  == this study presents a simple and fast method for the identification of bifidobacteria using a thin layer chromatographic (tlc) analysis of the short chain fatty acids in a culture broth. when the chromatogram was sprayed with the  indicator solution (methyl red-bromophenol blue in 70% ethanol), lactic acid exhibited two red spots, and acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid all produced blue spots. succinic acid and citric acid produced yellow and dark yellow spot, respectively. in addition, these organic acids showed different r(f) values. the total time taken to analyze the organic acids in the 10 bacterial culture broths using the proposed method was approximately 50 min. the proposed tlc method was used to analyze the organic acids in culture broths of the following strains, five bifidobacterium species. (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. bifidum, and b. adolescentis) and five other lactic acid bacteria strains (lactobacillus casei, l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus, and s. lactis). both spots of lactic acid and acetic  acid were detected on all the tlc plates from the five bifidobacterial culture broths. the five other lactic acid bacterial culture broths, however, only exhibited lactic acid spots. accordingly, the proposed tlc method would appear to be a useful tool for rapid identification of bifidobacterium spp. at the genus level.

TI  == influence of a probiotic yoghurt on the status of vitamins b(1), b(2) and b(6) in the healthy adult human.
AB  == background/aims: the main reason for this study was to determine whether yoghurt  bacteria, being rich in some water-soluble vitamins, release them or utilize vitamins from their surroundings. our study was trying to determine for the first time, if the viable bacteria of probiotic yoghurt are able to influence the parameters of the b-vitamin (b(1), b(2), b(6)) status of the healthy adult human. methods: the test yoghurt was commercially available probiotic yoghurt prepared with streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus acidophilus, enriched with lactobacillus casei gg. different chemical forms of all investigated b-vitamins were determined by hplc methods. in order to determine the influence of the yoghurt flora, each of 12 subjects consumed four yoghurt portions 125 g each ( =  500 g) a day, containing thermally inactivated cultures during the first 2-week period and yoghurt without heat treatment during the second 2-week period. results: the heat treatment of the probiotic yoghurt caused negligible changes in vitamin contents. the plasma levels of thiamin decreased significantly (p < 0.01) after the first 2-week period and kept on decreasing during the second 2-week period. a similar trend was found in the urinary excretion. the plasma levels of  the b(2)-vitamers were different. the flavin adenine dinucleotide concentrations  increased significantly (p < 0.01) after the consumption of heat-treated yoghurt  and decreased significantly (p < 0.05) after the following 2 weeks, in which the  subjects received the untreated yoghurt. in contrast, the flavin mononucleotide plasma levels decreased during the first 2-week period and increased during the second part of the study, but the change was not statistically significant. the free riboflavin concentrations in plasma and urine showed a continuous but not significant increase. the concentrations of pyridoxal-5-phosphate in plasma increased after the consumption of yoghurt with the inactivated bacteria and decreased in the second part of the study. however, the differences were not significant. the excretion of thiamin, b(2)- and b(6)-vitamers in the faeces did  not significantly change throughout the study period (p>0.05). conclusions: our observations show that the bacterial flora of the examined yoghurt does not influence the vitamin b(1), b(2) and b(6) status of man. it seems likely that even lactobacilli of the 'probiotic' type which are vitamin b consumers can decrease the bioavailability of these vitamins for man. obviously a thermal death of the cells did not induce a release of physiologically active vitamins.

TI  == gut mucosal immunostimulation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the beneficial properties of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on human health have been frequently demonstrated. the interaction of lab with the lymphoid cells associated to the gut to activate the mucosal immune system and the mechanisms by which they can exert an adjuvant effect is still unclear, as well as if this property is common for all the lab. we studied the influence of the oral administration of different geneous of lab such as lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. plantarum, lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus. we determined if the lab assayed were able to stimulate the specific, the non-specific immune response (inflammatory response), or both. we demonstrated that all the bacteria assayed were able to increase the number of iga producing cells associated to the lamina  propria of small intestine. this effect was dose dependent. the increase in iga+  producing cells was not always correlated with an increase in the cd4+ t cell number, indicating that some lab assayed only induced clonal expansion of b cells triggered to produce iga. most of them, induced an increase in the number of cells involved in the inflammatory immune response. cd8+ t cell were diminished or not affected, with exception of l. plantarum that induced an increase at low dose. this fact would mean that lab are unable to induce cytotoxicity mechanisms. we demonstrated the importance in the selection of lab to be used as gut mucosal  adjuvant. the different behaviours observed among them on the gut mucosal immune  response, specially those that induce inflammatory immune response, show that not all the lab can be used as oral adjuvant and that the beneficial effect of them can not generalized to genous or specie. the immunoadjuvant capacity would be a property of the strain assayed.

TI  == changes in the cultivable flora in deep carious lesions following a stepwise excavation procedure.
AB  == this study examined the cultivable microflora before and after stepwise excavation procedures in deep carious lesions in 9 permanent teeth, categorized according to degrees of proximal surface destruction. the final excavation was performed 4-6 months after the initial treatment, which included peripheral dentine excavation and removal of the central cariogenic biomass and the superficial necrotic dentine. dentine colour and consistency were assessed by means of standardized scales before the application of a ca(oh)(2) compound and temporary sealing. reassessments were performed before and after the final excavation. microbiological samples of the central demineralized dentine were obtained with a sterile bur before and after the first excavation, as well as before and after the final excavation. after anaerobic cultivation on enriched non-selective tryptic soy agar, 30 colonies from a representative area were identified by standardized biochemical and physiological tests. before temporary  restoration, a yellowish and light brown demineralized soft dentine was typically observed, and gram-positive rods accounted for 70% and lactobacilli for 50% of the total colony-forming units. lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus and actinomyces naeslundii dominated the lactobacilli and the other gram-positive rods, respectively. gram-negative rods were the next most frequent isolates, followed by streptococci, each group accounting for about 20% of the colony-forming units in positive samples. before the final excavation, which did  not cause exposure of the pulp in any of the cases, the retained demineralized dentine had changed into a darker and harder tissue, and the total colony-forming units, as well as the frequency and proportions of lactobacilli were substantially reduced. gram-negative rods also declined, and the flora was dominated by a. naeslundii and various streptococci. in conclusion, the cultivable flora detected following the treatment interval had declined substantially, and the distribution of bacterial species did not represent a typical cariogenic microbiota of deep lesions, confirming the clinical findings of arrested caries progression.

AB  == chronic pulpal inflammation under caries appears to be elicited by bacterial antigens that diffuse into the pulp through dentinal tubules. this prompted the hypothesis that cytokines elicited by antigens from streptococcus mutans, which frequently dominates shallow lesions, could play a major role in eliciting the initial t-cell response in the pulp. to test this, we examined the ability of s.  mutans to stimulate t cells and elicit cytokines and used lactobacillus casei, which often predominates in deep carious lesions where b cells and plasma cells predominate, as a control. in addition, the presence of cytokines in the pulp was analyzed at the mrna level. s. mutans elicited potent gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures and reduced the cd4/cd8 ratio by promoting cd8(+) t cells. multiple inflammatory cytokine mrnas (ifn-gamma, interleukin 4 [il-4], and il-10) were detected in human dental  pulp. a higher prevalence of ifn-gamma (67%) than il-4 (19%) or il-10 (29%) was obtained in shallow caries, suggesting a type 1 cytokine mechanism in early pulpitis where s. mutans predominates. in contrast, in deep caries no differences in cytokine frequency were observed. furthermore, the presence of ifn-gamma in the pulp correlated with the presence of s. mutans. the extraordinary induction of type 1 cytokines and the preferential activation of cd8(+) t cells by s. mutans offers an explanation for the etiology of the cd8(+) t-cell-dominant lesion in early pulpitis and suggests that s. mutans may have a major impact on the initial lesion and pulpal pathology.

TI  == fractional inhibitory concentration index of combinations of antibacterial agents against cariogenic organisms.
AB  == objectives: to examine the inhibitory effects between paired combinations of four antibacterial agents that have been investigated in dentistry against six bacteria associated with dentinal caries. methods: the antibacterial agents tested were: chlorhexidine dihydrochloride, benzalkonium chloride, cetrimide and  cetylpyridinium chloride. two organisms each belonging to streptococcus, lactobacillus and actinomyces species were evaluated against these agents. a checkerboard microtitration method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration and fractionary inhibitory concentration (fic) and summation operator fic index of the paired combinations of antibacterial agents against the six species of bacteria. appropriate controls were included. the summation operator fic index was then used to determine if synergy, antagonism, or indifference occurred as a result of interactions between the antibacterial agents and the test organisms. results: the data from a total of 295 test results were evaluated. using summation operator fic values for synergy as < or = 0.5 and antagonism as > 4.0 as recommended by the american society for microbiology, no significant synergistic or antagonistic interactions were observed between the paired antibacterial agents when tested against selected organisms. however, a tendency for an additive antibacterial effect was observed with approximately a third of the test results. nonetheless, no combination of antibacterial agents appeared to be superior to any other. conclusions: according to these in vitro results, there appears to be no beneficial effect of combining the antibacterial  agents against the individual cariogenic micro-organisms selected. however, it may be beneficial to use combined antibacterial agents that have a broader range  of activity against an ecosystem of bacteria than using individual agents.

TI  == competition for glucose between candida albicans and oral bacteria grown in mixed culture in a chemostat.
AB  == the competition for glucose as a growth-limiting substrate between candida albicans and a mixed community of oral bacteria was investigated. a chemostat was operated under glucose-limiting and glucose excess conditions at a dilution rate  of 0.05/h. a mixed population of oral bacteria was established and after a steady state had been reached the chemostat was inoculated with c. albicans. seven bacterial species streptococcus sanguis, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, lactobacillus casei, veillonella dispar, eubacterium saburreum and fusobacterium nucleatum - were able to establish stable populations under glucose-limiting conditions. the  yeast was unable to grow with the bacteria under glucose limitation. only three bacterial species, s. sobrinus, l. casei and e. saburreum, became established under glucose-excess conditions. c. albicans was also able to become established  in the glucose-excess chemostat and could grow and maintain a steady state in a mixed culture with these organisms. l. casei, s. mitis and s. sobrinus had faster glucose consumption rates than c. albicans. all the bacteria, except for e nucleatum, had maximum specific growth rates higher than c. albicans. the results suggest that glucose may act as a growth-limiting substrate for c. albicans in the establishment and growth of the yeast in a mixed community of oral bacteria.

TI  == the formation of mixed culture biofilms of oral species along a gradient of shear stress.
AB  == a chemostat mixed culture system was used to produce two distinct ecological states, state-1 (caries-like microcosm) and state-2 (periodontal-like microcosm). eleven bacterial species (streptococcus gordonii, strep. mitis i, strep. mutans,  strep. oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, neisseria subflava, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, veillonella dispar) were used to inoculate the planktonic system. a flow cell, designed to produce convergent flow with increasing shear stress, was attached to the chemostat system, and the resultant biofilms developed from the state-1 and state-2 microcosms along the shear stress gradient were examined and compared using image analysis and viable counts. the biofilm produced from state-1 showed  a lower shear stress tolerance (0.146 pa) than the state-2 biofilm (0.236 pa). the biofilm compositions did not vary along the gradient of shear stress and were dependent on the initial inoculum conditions. gram-positive species were predominant in the state-1 biofilm, while gram-negative species were predominant  in state-2.

AB  == we evaluated the suitability of argentinian fresco cheese as a food carrier of probiotic cultures. we used cultures of bifidobacterium bifidum (two strains), bifidobacterium longum (two strains), bifidobacterium sp. (one strain), lactobacillus acidophilus (two strains), and lactobacillus casei (two strains) in different combinations, as probiotic adjuncts. probiotic, lactic starter (lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus), and contaminant (coliforms,  yeasts, and molds) organisms were counted at 0, 30, and 60 d of refrigerated storage. furthermore, the acid resistance of probiotic and starter bacteria was determined from hydrochloric solutions (ph 2 and 3) of fresco cheese. the results showed that nine different combinations of bifidobacteria and l. acidophilus had  a satisfactory viability (count decreases in 60 d <1 log order) in the cheese. both combinations of bifidobacteria and l. casei cultures assayed also showed a satisfactory survival (counts decreased <1 log order for bifidobacteria but no decrease was detected for l. casei). on the other hand, the three combinations of bifidobacteria, l. acidophilus, and l. casei tested adapted well to the fresco cheese environment. when a cheese homogenate at ph 3 was used to partially simulate the acidic conditions in the stomach, the probiotic cultures had an excellent ability to remain viable up to 3 h. at ph 2, the cell viability was more affected; b. bifidum was the most resistant organism. this study showed that the argentinian fresco cheese could be used as an adequate carrier of probiotic bacteria.

TI  == microbial community dynamics during production of the mexican fermented maize dough pozol.
AB  == the dynamics of the microbial community responsible for the traditional fermentation of maize in the production of mexican pozol was investigated by using a polyphasic approach combining (i) microbial enumerations with culture media, (ii) denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) fingerprinting of total community dna with bacterial and eukaryotic primers and sequencing of partial 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) genes, (iii) quantification of rrnas from dominant microbial taxa by using phylogenetic oligonucleotide probes, and (iv) analysis of sugars and fermentation products. a streptococcus species dominated the fermentation and accounted for between 25 and 75% of the total flora throughout the process. results also showed that the initial epiphytic aerobic microflora was replaced in the first 2 days by heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria (lab), including a close relative of lactobacillus fermentum, producing  lactic acid and ethanol; this heterolactic flora was then progressively replaced  by homofermentative lab (mainly close relatives of l. plantarum, l. casei, and l. delbrueckii) which continued acidification of the maize dough. at the same time,  a very diverse community of yeasts and fungi developed, mainly at the periphery of the dough. the analysis of the dgge patterns obtained with bacterial and eukaryotic primers targeting the 16s and 18s rdna genes clearly demonstrated that there was a major shift in the community structure after 24 h and that high biodiversity-according to the shannon-weaver index-was maintained throughout the  process. these results proved that a relatively high number of species, at least  six to eight, are needed to perform this traditional lactic acid fermentation. the presence of bifidobacterium, enterococcus, and enterobacteria suggests a fecal origin of some important pozol microorganisms. overall, the results obtained with different culture-dependent or -independent techniques clearly confirmed the importance of developing a polyphasic approach to study the ecology of fermented foods.

TI  == effect of probiotic bacteria on prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses in vitro.
AB  == the proliferation of yeasts in the mixed bacterial and fungal biofilms colonising silicone rubber voice prostheses in laryngectomised patients is the main cause of malfunctioning of the valve mechanism on the oesophageal side of the prostheses.  indwelling voice prostheses usually have to be replaced every 3-4 months. the consumption of probiotic bacteria is largely motivated by health claims related to the urogenital and lower digestive tract, but not to the upper digestive tract. the present study examined the influence of probiotic bacteria on the prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses, as formed in a modified robbins device. exposure of oropharyngeal biofilms on voice prostheses to suspensions of bifidobacterium infantis 420 or enterococcus faecium 603 did not significantly reduce the number of yeasts in the biofilm. however, suspensions of lactobacillus fermentum b54, l. rhamnosus 744 or l. lactis cremoris sk11 led to a reduction in the number of yeasts harvested from the voice prostheses. suspensions of l. casei shirota and streptococcus thermophilus b significantly reduced the number of yeasts in the biofilm to 39% and 33%, respectively. the reduction brought about in yeast prevalence in the mixed biofilm was greatest by exposure to a suspension of l. lactis 53, with yeast prevalence only 4% of the control. in conclusion, the study demonstrated that the prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice  prostheses might be controlled by consumption of probiotic bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of acidified nitrite on cariogenic bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial agent nitric oxide (no) is formed in the mouth and its concentration is directly related to salivary nitrite, which in turn is related to dietary nitrate intake. the aim of this study was to determine whether nitrite under acidic conditions will have an inhibitory effect, possibly occurring through no production, on streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei and actinomyces naeslundii. whereas the growth of s. mutans was inhibited by a more acid ph, the addition of nitrite caused a marked, further dose-dependent reduction in bacterial numbers after 24 h of exposure. similar effects were observed with a. naeslundii and l. casei. the ability of these bacteria to recover from nitrite exposure was also markedly affected by nitrite concentration. at acidity levels below ph 7, low concentrations of nitrite (0.2 mm) caused effective complete killing of s. mutans, with similar effects on the other organisms tested. these results demonstrate the possibility that nitrite in saliva has an effect on the growth and survival of cariogenic bacteria.

AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the amounts and pattern of fluoride release  and antibacterial properties of new-generation restoratives over a 35-day period. materials evaluated included fluoride-releasing composites (tetric, experimental  x), compomers (dyract, compoglass), and a resin-modified glass-ionomer cement (fuji ii lc). a conventional glass ionomer (fuji ii cap) was used as a control for fluoride-release testing. five samples of each restorative material were evaluated for daily fluoride release over a 35-day period by means of ion chromatography. ranking of materials from least to greatest total fluoride release over 35 days was as follows: tetric < experimental x < dyract < fuji ii lc < compoglass < fuji ii cap. fuji ii cap had significantly greater fluoride release than all other materials evaluated. fuji ii cap, fuji ii lc, and compoglass had similar patterns of fluoride release characterized by a high initial release that was many times that released later. the fluoride-releasing composites evaluated stopped releasing fluoride by day 14. antibacterial testing  was conducted using the agar diffusion inhibitory test. five samples of each restorative were assessed at baseline and weekly intervals up to 35 days. the microorganisms used were lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus. irm, a zinc oxide/eugenol cement, was used as the baseline control. none of the restorative materials evaluated affected the growth of l casei, s sobrinus, or s mutans at all time periods including baseline, where fluoride was detected in the agar beneath the specimen disks. there was no correlation noted between fluoride-release potential and antibacterial properties.

TI  == modulating immune responses with probiotic bacteria.
AB  == for many years, probiotic bacteria have been known to confer health benefits to the consumer. one possible mechanism for this may be the ability of probiotic bacteria to modulate immune responses. oral administration of lactobacillus casei strain shirota (lcs) has been found to enhance innate immunity by stimulating the activity of splenic nk cells. oral feeding with killed lcs was able to stimulate  the production of th1 cytokines, resulting in repressed production of ige antibodies against ovalbumin in experimental mice. the ability to switch mucosal  immune responses towards th1 with probiotic bacteria provides a strategy for treatment of allergic disorders. growth of meth a tumour cells in the lungs was also inhibited by intrapleural injection of lcs. oral administration of other probiotic bacteria, such as streptococcus thermophilus (st), lactobacillus fermentum (lf) and yeast (y), elicited different immune responses. mice that were prefed yeast or lf followed by feeding with ovalbumin (ova) responded better to vaccination with ova than mice not given either probiotic or ova or mice that had been prefed only ova. however, antibody responses were significantly suppressed in response to vaccination with ova in mice that had been prefed yeast followed by yeast and ova as well as mice prefed lf followed by lf and ova. prefeeding st  followed by ova feeding enhanced cellular immune responses against ovalbumin. in  contrast, mice prefed st followed by st + ova were hyporesponsive against ova. while antigen feeding alone appears to prime for an immune response, cofeeding antigen with probiotic bacteria can suppress both antibody and cellular immune responses and may provide an efficacious protocol to attenuate autoimmune diseases, such as experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, by jointly dosing with myelin basic protein and probiotic bacteria.

AB  == cells from a number of bacterial genera have been shown to possess mitogenic and  polyclonal activating properties when cultured with cells of the immune system. based on previously reported health immune-enhancing effects of fermented dairy products, we tested the potentiating effects of representative lactic acid bacteria and their extracts on leukocyte function. specifically, the effects of in vitro exposure to heat-killed cells of bifidobacterium, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. gasseri, l. helveticus, l. reuteri, and  streptococcus thermophilus, their cell walls, and their cytoplasmic extracts on proliferation as well as cytokine and nitric oxide (no) production were examined  in the raw 264.7 macrophage cell line. a similar strategy was applied to murine cultures composed of peritoneal, spleen, and peyer's patch cells. both the cell wall and cytoplasmic fractions of lactic acid bacteria were able to stimulate cloned macrophages to produce significant amounts of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, (interleukin) il-6, and no. pronounced enhancement of il-6 production by peritoneal cells was observed when cultured with those extracts, whereas, effects were not noted in spleen and peyer's patch cell cultures from mice. based on the  results, it appears that, as a group, the lactic acid bacteria were capable of stimulating macrophages and possibly other immune cells to produce cytokines and  no, and both their cell walls and cytoplasm contributed to these capacities.

TI  == human cytokine responses induced by gram-positive cell walls of normal intestinal microbiota.
AB  == the normal microbiota plays an important role in the health of the host, but little is known of how the human immune system recognizes and responds to gram-positive indigenous bacteria. we have investigated cytokine responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) to gram-positive cell walls (cw) derived from four common intestinal indigenous bacteria, eubacterium aerofaciens  (eu.a. ), eubacterium limosum (eu.l.), lactobacillus casei (l.c.), and lactobacillus fermentum (l.f.). our results indicate that gram-positive cw of the normal intestinal microbiota can induce cytokine responses of the human pbmc. the profile, level and kinetics of these responses are similar to those induced by lipopolysaccharide (lps) or cw derived from a pathogen, streptococcus pyogenes (s.p.). bacterial cw are capable of inducing production of a proinflammatory cytokine, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), and an anti-inflammatory cytokine, il-10, but not that of il-4 or interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma). monocytes  are the main cell population in pbmc to produce tnf-alpha and il-10. induction of cytokine secretion is serum-dependent; both cd14-dependent and -independent pathways are involved. these findings suggest that the human cytokine responses induced by gram-positive cw of the normal intestinal microbiota are similar to those induced by lps or gram-positive cw of the pathogens.

TI  == study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. antigens administered orally can interact with m cells of peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. we have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance  the gut inflammatory immune response. the aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. we studied iga+ and igm+ b cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and cd4+ t cells and iga anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by  oral administration of lactobacillus casei, lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lb.  acidophilus, lb. plantarum, lb. rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, and streptococcus  salivarius ssp. thermophilus. the increase in the iga+ b cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the iga cycle by interaction with m cells from peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. the igm+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from igm+ to iga+. the increase in the cd4+ cells suggests interaction of peyer's patches and  enhancement of the b- and t-cell migration. the anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. we demonstrated that lb. casei and lb. plantarum were able to interact with peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in iga-, cd4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase  in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. although lb. rhamnosus and strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. lactococcus lactis and lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of iga+ cells entering the iga cycle but not cd4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated b lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. we did not determine specific antibodies against lc. lactis or lb. bulgaricus.

TI  == insertional inactivation of genes responsible for the d-alanylation of lipoteichoic acid in streptococcus gordonii dl1 (challis) affects intrageneric coaggregations.
AB  == most human oral viridans streptococci participate in intrageneric coaggregations, the cell-to-cell adherence among genetically distinct streptococci. two genes relevant to these intrageneric coaggregations were identified by transposon tn916 mutagenesis of streptococcus gordonii dl1 (challis). a 626-bp sequence flanking the left end of the transposon was homologous to dlta and dltb of lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 7469 (formerly called lactobacillus casei). a 60-kb probe based on this flanking sequence was used to identify the homologous dna in a fosmid library of s. gordonii dl1. this dna encoded d-alanine-d-alanyl carrier protein ligase that was expressed in escherichia coli from the fosmid clone. the cloned streptococcal dlta was disrupted by inserting an ermam cassette, and then it was  linearized and transformed into s. gordonii dl1 for allelic replacement. erythromycin-resistant transformants containing a single insertion in dlta exhibited a loss of d-alanyl esters in lipoteichoic acid (lta) and a loss of intrageneric coaggregation. this phenotype was correlated with the loss of a 100-kda surface protein reported previously to be involved in mediating intrageneric coaggregation (c. j. whittaker, d. l. clemans, and p. e. kolenbrander, infect. immun. 64:4137-4142, 1996). the mutants retained the parental ability to participate in intergeneric coaggregation with human oral actinomyces, indicating the specificity of the mutation in altering intrageneric  coaggregations. the mutants were altered morphologically and exhibited aberrant cell septa in a variety of pleomorphs. the natural dna transformation frequency was reduced 10-fold in these mutants. southern analysis of chromosomal dnas from  various streptococcal species with the dlta probe revealed the presence of this gene in most viridans streptococci. thus, it is hypothesized that d-alanyl lta may provide binding sites for the putative 100-kda adhesin and scaffolding for the proper presentation of this adhesin to mediate intrageneric coaggregation.

AB  == intracellular polysaccharides (ips) are glycogen-like storage polymers which contribute significantly to streptococcus mutans-induced cariogenesis. we previously identified and cloned a locus from the s. mutans chromosome which is required for the accumulation of ips. sequencing of this locus revealed at least  four contiguous open reading frames, all of which are preceded by a common promoter region and are transcribed in the same direction. analysis of the amino  acid sequence deduced from the first of these open reading frames (orf1) revealed domains which are highly conserved among d-alanine-activating enzymes (dlta) in lactobacillus rhamnosus (formerly lactobacillus casei) and bacillus subtilis. the deduced amino acid sequences derived from orf2, -3, and -4 also exhibit extensive similarity to dltb, -c, and -d, respectively, in these microorganisms. however, southern hybridization experiments indicate that this operon maps to a locus on the s. mutans chromosome which is separate from the glgp, glga, and glgd genes, whose products are known mediators of bacterial ips accumulation. we therefore assigned a new dlt designation to the locus which we had formerly called glg. we  maintain that the dlt genes are involved in s. mutans ips accumulation, however,  since they complement a mutation in trans which otherwise renders s. mutans ips deficient. in this study, we found that expression of the s. mutans dlt genes is  growth phase dependent and is modulated by carbohydrates internalized via the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (pts). we demonstrated that the s.  mutans dlt genes are expressed constitutively when non-pts sugars are provided as the sole source of carbohydrate. consistent with a role for the pts in dlt expression is a similar constitutive expression of the dlt genes in an s. mutans  pts mutant grown in a chemically defined medium supplemented with glucose. in summary, these findings support a novel role for the dlt gene products in s. mutans ips accumulation and suggest that dlt expression in this oral pathogen is  subject to complex mechanisms of control imposed by growth phase, dietary carbohydrate, and other factors present in the plaque environment.

TI  == effects of lactic acid bacteria ingestion of basal cytokine mrna and immunoglobulin levels in the mouse.
AB  == an increasing number of functional foods and pharmaceutical preparations containing lactic acid bacteria are being promoted with health claims based on the potential probiotic characteristics and on their capacity for stimulating the host immune system. however, the specific immune effects of oral administration of these microbes remain undefined. in this study, we tested the hypothesis that  basal gastrointestinal immune status in mice is affected by orally administered lactic acid bacteria. the specific objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of repeated oral exposure to viable and nonviable lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, and streptococcus thermophilus) in mice on basal cytokine mrna expression in mucosal (peyer's patches), systemic (spleen), and lymphoid tissue and on immunoglobulin levels. the results indicated that oral exposure to 10(9) cfu/day for up to 14 days did not significantly affect basal interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, or  interleukin-6 mrna expression or total serum and intestinal immunoglobulins.

TI  == ex vivo effects of lactobacilli, streptococci, and bifidobacteria ingestion on cytokine and nitric oxide production in a murine model.
AB  == increasing numbers of functional foods and pharmaceutical preparations are being  promoted with health claims based on the potential probiotic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria and on their capacity for stimulating the host immune system. however, the specific immune effects of oral administration of these microbes still remains undefined. in this study, we tested the hypothesis that production of immunologic mediators by leukocytes in mice is affected by orally administered lactic acid bacteria. the specific objectives of this study were to  evaluate the effects of exposure to eight different lactic acid bacteria in mice  on ex vivo cytokine and nitric oxide production in leukocyte cultures. mice were  gavaged with 1 x 10(9) viable bacteria and peritoneal, peyer's patch and splenic  leukocytes were isolated 8 h later. these were cultured for 2 or 5 days in the presence or absence of mitogens and then interleukin (il)-6, il-12, interferon (ifn)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, and nitric oxide production was measured. the results revealed that lactobacillus acidophilus and l. casei potentiated il-6 and il-12 production by peritoneal cells whereas l. acidophilus  upregulated ifn-gamma and nitric oxide. in contrast, l. helveticus, l. gasseri, l. reuteri, and bifidobacterium attenuated the production of il-6, ifn-gamma, and nitric oxide by peritoneal cells. tnf-alpha was not detectable in peritoneal cultures. none of the bacteria altered ex vivo production of cytokines or nitric  oxide by peyer's patch or spleen cell cultures. taken together, the results suggest that prior oral exposure to lactic acid bacteria could differentially potentiate or attenuate subsequent cytokine and nitric oxide production by peritoneal cells.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria growth promoters from spirulina platensis.
AB  == spirulina has been used for many years as human food because of its high protein  content and nutritional value. some strains also produce bioactive substances that may inhibit or promote microbial growth. lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus bulgaricus were grown in rich media, mrs and rm, as well as in minimal saline medium with and without addition of extracellular products obtained from a late log phase culture of spirulina platensis in zarrouk medium. in both mrs and rm media, the extracellular products significantly promote the growth of the lactic  acid bacteria assayed. this stimulatory effect was observed in media with ph adjusted to 5.3, 6.3 and 7.0. no effect was observed in minimal saline medium.

AB  == purpose: to determine and compare the in vitro antibacterial activity of three self-etching primers. materials and methods: lb primer (liner bond 2), fb primer  (fluoro bond), and mb conditioner (tokuso mac bond) were evaluated. the antibacterial activity against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei, and actinomyces viscosus was assessed using the agar disc-diffusion method. twenty microliters of each primer were impregnated into a paper disc and placed on a brain heart infusion agar plate inoculated with a bacterial suspension. the size  of inhibition zones produced around the specimens was measured after 48 hours of  incubation of the plate. in addition, 20 microliters of each primer was added to  a 1 ml suspension of s. mutans adjusted to 1 x 10(6), 1 x 10(5), or 1 x 10(4) cfu/ml in phosphate buffered saline and kept in contact for 30 seconds. the number of viable bacteria after contact with each primer was determined. the results were analyzed by anova and fisher's plsd test (p < 0.05). results: lb primer and fb primer produced inhibition zones against s. mutans and a. viscosus, and mb conditioner produced an inhibition zone only against a. viscosus. no inhibition zones were produced by any of the primers against l. casei. the three  primers completely killed 1 x 10(4) cfu of s. mutans within 30 seconds of contact. when 1 x 10(5) or 1 x 10(6) cfu of bacterial cells were kept in contact, significant differences in the number of recovered viable cells were found among  the three primers with mb conditioner being the most bactericidal. lb primer had  little bactericidal activity and the mean reduction of viable bacteria by fb primer and mb conditioner was approximately 30% and 65%, respectively.

TI  == acid-regulated proteins induced by streptococcus mutans and other oral bacteria during acid shock.
AB  == our previous research has demonstrated that with the more aciduric oral bacteria, an acid shock to sub-lethal ph values results in the induction of an acid tolerance response that protects the cells at extremely low ph (ph 3.0-4.0) that  kills unadapted control cells maintained at ph 7.5 (oral microbiol immunol 1997:  12: 266-273). in this study, we were interested in comparing the protein profiles of acid-shocked and control cells of nine organisms from three acid-ogenic genera that could be categorized as strong, weak and non-acid responders in an attempt to identify proteins that could be classified as acid-regulated proteins and which may be important in the process of survival at very low ph. for this, log-phase cultures were rapidly acidified from ph 7.5 to 5.5 in the presence of [14c]-amino acids for varying periods up to 2 h, the period previously shown to be required for maximum induction of the acid response. the cells were extracted  for total protein and subjected to one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide chromatography with comparable control and acid-shocked protein profiles compared by scanning and computer analysis. of particular interest were the proteins in the acid-shocked cells that showed enhanced labeling (i.e., synthesis) over the control cells, since these were considered acid-regulated proteins of importance in ph homeostasis. streptococcus mutans lt11 generated the most rapid and complex pattern: a total of 36 acid-regulated proteins showing enhanced synthesis, with 25 appearing within the first 30 min of acid shock. the enhanced synthesis was transient with all proteins, with the exception of two with molecular weights of 50/49 and 33/32 kda. within the acid-regulated proteins were proteins having molecular weights comparable to the  heat shock proteins and the various subunits of the membrane h+/atpase. by comparison, the strong responder, lactobacillus casei 151, showed the enhanced formation of only nine proteins within the first 30 min of the acid shock, with a total of 11 acid-regulated proteins formed during the 2-h adaptation period with  enhanced synthesis transient for seven of these proteins. streptococcus salivarius at2 and streptococcus gordonii th12 had the formation of 6 and 8 proteins enhanced, while the weakly responding organisms, streptococcus sanguis atcc 10,556 and streptococcus oralis atcc 10,557, exhibited 8 and 6 such proteins, respectively. even non-responding strains unable to survive at very low ph, such as streptococcus sobrinus ch125/43, streptococcus mitis atcc 12,261 and  actinomyces naeslundii 301-13 showed the initial formation of 3-9 acid-regulated  proteins, but protein synthesis was not sustained over the entire adaptation period. clearly, the survival of oral bacteria at very low ph is related, not to  the total number of the acid-regulated proteins induced per se but to the formation of key proteins that function to augment normal ph homeostasis.

TI  == subtraction radiography of dentinal caries-like lesions induced in vitro by cariogenic bacteria.
AB  == purpose: the objective of this project was to develop an in vitro model system for investigations of dentinal caries. methods: five extracted primary molar teeth with circular cavity preparations to the depth of the dentinoenamel junction were mounted individually in cold-cure acrylic bases constructed to fit  a positioning jig in a schick-technologies digital radiographic imaging apparatus. the mounted teeth (mt) were incubated with pure cultures of streptococcus mutans for 7 days and lactobacillus casei for 38 days. at baseline  and on day 23 and 45, four digital radiographs of each mt were made. subtraction  radiography was performed and analyzed using custom interactive software. results: lesions progressed roughly halfway through the dentin in all teeth at 23 days and approximated the pulp chambers at 45 days of incubation. images resulting from subtraction procedures clearly revealed incremental caries progression which could be quantitated. conclusion: the model may be useful for screening cariostatic dental materials or treatments and investigating microbial  mechanisms in dentinal caries.

TI  == effects of tamoxifen, melatonin, coenzyme q10, and l-carnitine supplementation on bacterial growth in the presence of mycotoxins.
AB  == the involvement of toxic oxygen intermediates in the bacteriostatic effects of mycotoxins (t-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin a, aflatoxin b1, and fumonisin  b1) was investigated by producing bacterial growth curves using turbidimetry assays in the presence and absence of oxygen radical-scavenging substances. the strains used in this study included escherichia coli (ft 101), streptococcus agalactiae (ft 311, ft 313, ft 315), staphylococcus aureus (ft 192), yersinia enterocolitica (ft 430), salmonella infantis (ft 431), erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (ft 432), lactobacillus plantarum (ft234) and lactobacillus casei (ft 232). tamoxifen, melatonin, l-carnitine and coenzyme q10 were used as radical scavengers against oxygen toxicity to the strains studied. tamoxifen was the most effective in inhibiting bacterial growth when used at a high concentration, whereas melatonin and l-carnitine were less effective. a combination of l-carnitine and coenzyme q10 provided better protection against oxygen toxicity caused by the mycotoxins growth than they did individually. it was concluded that oxygen radicals are involved in the killing of bacteria and that there is endogenous formation of toxic oxygen products by mycotoxins. the objective of this study was to determine whether the antioxidants were able to counteract the  toxic effects of the mycotoxins. the data obtained indicate that bacterial growth can be inhibited especially by t-2 toxin, aflatoxin b1 and ochratoxin a and that  this effect can be partially counteracted by antioxidants such as coenzyme q10 plus l-carnitine.

AB  == the binding specificities of streptococcus glucosyltransferase (gtf) b, c and d for hydroxyapatite (ha), saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha), and bacterial surfaces were examined. for ha beads the following values were obtained: (k = affinity; n = number of binding sites) gtfb, k = 46 x 10(5) ml/mumol, n = 0.65 x  10(-6) mumol/m2; gtfc, k = 86 x 10(5) ml/mumol, n = 4.42 x 10(-6) mumol/m2.; gtfd, k = 100 x 10(5) ml/mumol, n = 0.83 x 10(-6) mumol/m2. for sha beads, the following values were obtained: gtfb, k = 14.7 x 10(5) ml/mumol, n = 1.03 x 10(-6) mumol/m2; gtfc, k = 21.3 x 10(5) ml/mumol, n = 3.66 x 10(-6) mumol/m2; gtfd, k = 1.73 x 10(5) ml/mumol, n = 8.88 x 10(-6) mumol/m2. the binding of gtfb  to sha beads was reduced in the presence of parotid saliva, but the binding of gtfc and d was unaffected. the binding of gtfb to sha in the presence of parotid  saliva supplemented with gtfc and d was reduced when compared with its binding to sha in the presence of parotid saliva alone. in contrast, te binding of gtfc and  sha was unaffected when parotid saliva was supplemented with the other gtf enzymes. gtfb bound to several bacterial strains (strep, mutans gs-5, actinomyces viscosus omz105e and lactobacillus casei 4646) in an active form, while gtfc and  d did not bind to bacterial surfaces. it is concluded that of the three gtf enzymes, gtfc has the highest affinity for ha and sha surfaces and can adsorb on  the the sha surface in the presence of the other two enzymes. gtfd also binds to  sha in the presence of the other enzymes but has a very low affinity for the surface. gtfb does not bind to sha in the presence of the other gtf enzymes but binds avidly to bacterial surfaces in an active form. therefore, gtfc most probably binds to apatitic surfaces, while gtfb binds to bacterial surfaces.

AB  == objectives: a monomer methacryloyloxydodecylpyridinium bromide (mdpb) has antibacterial activity before polymerization. furthermore, the antibacterial agent is immobilized by the polymerization of mdpb and the resin-based material incorporating mdpb is able to show an antibacterial effect even after being cured. the purpose of this study was to investigate the antibacterial effect of a dentine primer containing mdpb after curing. methods: the inhibitory effect of a  cured mdpb-containing primer on the growth of streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus and lactobacillus casei was determined by the agar-disc method. the bactericidal activity of cured primer during a 1-h contact period was assessed using s. mutans, and the elution of unpolymerized mdpb was measured with high performance liquid chromatography. results: cured mdpb-containing primer showed an inhibitory effect on the growth of all species which were in contact with the  specimen surface, and displayed a little bactericidal effect on s. mutans without releasing any unpolymerized antibacterial components. conclusion: incorporation of antibacterial monomer mdpb into dentine primer is beneficial for providing antibacterial activity after curing.

TI  == acid tolerance response and survival by oral bacteria.
AB  == using 21 species of oral bacteria, representing six acidogenic genera, we undertook to determine whether the ph-limiting exponential growth is related to the ability of the organisms to generate an acid-tolerance response that results  in enhanced survival at low ph. the lower ph limit of exponential growth varied by more than two units with that of neisseria a182 at ph 6.34; growth of lactobacillus casei rb1014 stopped at ph 3.81, with species of actinomyces, enterococcus, prevotella and streptococcus falling between these limits. the working hypothesis was that the organisms with the higher ph limits for growth are unable to respond to acidic environments in order to survive, whereas the more aciduric organisms would possess or acquire acid tolerance. adaptation to acid tolerance was tested by determining whether the prior exposure of exponential-phase cells to a low, sub-lethal ph would trigger the induction of a  mechanism that would enhance survival at a ph killing ph 7.5 control cells. the killing ph varied from ph 4.5 for prevotella intermedia atcc 25611 to ph 2.3 for  the three lactobacillus casei strains in the study, with the three streptococcus  mutans strains killed at ph 3.0 for 3 h. the adaptation experiments revealed three groups of organisms: non-acid-responders, generally representing strains with the highest terminal ph values; weak acid-responders in the middle of the ph list, generating low numbers of survivors at one or two ph values, and the aciduric, strong responders generating a high number of survivors at ph values in the range 6.0 to 3.5, but not at ph 7.5. predominant among the latter group were  the s. mutans and lactobacilli casei strains, with the most significant adaptive  response exhibited by s. mutans lt11 and s. mutans ingbritt, involving a process  that required protein synthesis. time course experiments with the latter organisms indicated that 90-120 min was required after exposure to the triggering ph before the acid response was fully functional. these results indicate that the sudden exposure of strains of oral streptococci and lactobacilli, as well as enterococcus faecalis, to ph values between 6.0 and 3.5 results in the induction  of an acid tolerance response that enhances the survival of these strains at or below ph 3.5.

TI  == ecological study of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus and lactobacillus spp. at sub-sites from approximal dental plaque from children.
AB  == previous immunofluorescence (if) studies have indicated that streptococcus mutans may preferentially colonise specific sub-sites within approximal plaque. the present study aimed to extend these observations to other mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in such gingival margin plaque. two hundred and seventy approximal plaque samples were taken from 90 teeth (3 from each tooth) in 64 children; three gingival margin sub-sites in relation to the contact area: away from (a), to the  side of(s) and below (b) the contact area. samples were processed by indirect if  using high-titred polyclonal anti-s. mutans 'c', anti-s. sobrinus 'd', anti-l. casei and anti-l. acidophilus antisera. an overall positive association was found between s. mutans 'c' and s. sobrinus 'd' (p < 0.001). significant differences (p < 0.1) were found between the proportional counts at each sub-site for s. mutans  'c': a = 39%, s = 51% and b = 70%, and for s. sobrinus 'd' 21, 33 and 49%. mutans streptococci (ms) appeared to preferentially colonise the sub-site below the contact area (b = 81%), compared with sub-sites a and s (48 and 62%, respectively). s. mutans 'c' and s. sobrinus 'd' were detected together at subsites a = 12%, s = 22%, and b = 38%, with proportional counts at b sites being higher than those at a (b > a, p < 0.01, and b > s, p < 0.05). lactobacillus spp. were isolated rarely, and were usually found together with ms. there was a positive relationship between the presence of lactobacilli or ms and caries (white spot lesions only), although these species could frequently be isolated from noncarious sites. the presence of both s. mutans 'c' and s. sobrinus 'd' were strongly correlated with early caries lesions. in addition, this study confirmed the variation in the microflora at different sub-sites within approximal dental plaque.

TI  == anaerobic killing of oral streptococci by reduced, transition metal cations.
AB  == reduced, transition metal cations commonly enhance oxidative damage to cells caused by hydroperoxides formed as a result of oxygen metabolism or added externally. as expected, the cations fe2+ and cu+ enhanced killing of streptococcus mutans gs-5 by hydroperoxides. however, unexpectedly, they also induced lethal damage under fully anaerobic conditions in a glove box with no exposure to o2 or hydroperoxides from initial treatment with the cations. sensitivities to anaerobic killing by fe2+ varied among the organisms tested. the oral streptococci streptococcus gordonii atcc 10558, streptococcus rattus fa-1, and streptococcus sanguis nctc 10904 were approximately as sensitive as s. mutans gs-5. enterococcus hirae atcc 9790, actinomyces viscosus omz105e, and actinomyces naeslundii wvu45 had intermediate sensitivity, while lactobacillus casei atcc 4646 and escherichia coli b were insensitive. killing of s. mutans gs-5 in response to millimolar levels of added fe2+ occurred over a wide range of temperatures and ph. the organism was able to take up ferrous iron, but ferric reductase activity could not be detected. chelators, uric acid, and thiocyanate were not effective inhibitors of the lethal damage. sulfhydryl compounds, ferricyanide, and ferrocyanide were protective if added prior to fe2+ exposure. fe2+, but not fe3+, acted to reduce the acid tolerance of glycolysis by intact cells of s. mutans. the reduction in acid tolerance appeared to be related directly to fe2+ inhibition of f-atpase, which could be assayed with permeabilized cells, isolated membranes, or f1 enzyme separated from membranes. cu+ and cu2+ also inhibited f-atpase and sensitized glycolysis by intact cells to acid. all of these damaging actions occurred anaerobically and thus did not appear to involve reactive oxygen species.

AB  == in the antimicrobial therapy of denture stomatitis, it is desirable to inhibit the growth of not only the primary causative organism, candida albicans, but also other oral bacteria closely associated with the condition. three synthetic anti-candidal chalcones were characterized and compared for their additional activity in inhibiting these causative bacteria. among the tested chalcones, 2,4,2'-trihydroxy-5'-methylchalcone showed the highest activity for different gram-positive bacteria. it inhibited the growth of streptococci, staphylococci and lactobacilli at 25.0-50.0 micrograms/ml which was lower than or comparable to its minimum inhibitory concentration for candida. it functioned with a bactericidal action and leaked 260 nm-absorbing substances from the streptococcal cells. the antimicrobial activity of 2,4,2'-trihydroxy-5'-methylchalcone against  both primary and secondary causative agents suggests it could be useful as a potent therapeutic agent in denture stomatitis.

TI  == investigation of calcium-binding sites on the surfaces of selected gram-positive  oral organisms.
AB  == dental plaque is rich in anionic groups with a high calcium-binding capacity which may affect mineral dynamics at the tooth surface. the two major calcium-binding sites on gram-positive cell surfaces are carboxylate groups (in proteins and peptidoglycan cross-links) and phosphate groups (in lipoteichoic and teichoic acid). equilibrium dialysis was used to measure calcium-binding capacities of whole cells and purified cell-wall material (cwm) from streptococcus mutans r9, strep. oralis ef186, strep. gordonii nctc 7865, strep. downei nctc 11391, actinomyces naeslundii wvu627 and lactobacillus casei ac413. this material was stripped of phosphate (ps-cwm) and treated to mask carboxylate  groups (cm-cwm). whole-cell calcium-binding capacities ranged from 240 (strep. downei) to 50 (l. casei) mu mol/g (dry wt). differences in cwm, ps-cwm and cm-cwm calcium-binding capacities demonstrated the greater importance of phosphate in comparison with carboxylate groups in cell calcium binding. these data indicate that, in streptococci, calcium binding is predominantly phosphate group-based, especially in the teichoic acid-containing strep. oralis. in the other species tested, calcium binding is predominantly carboxylate group-based.

TI  == the association of yogurt starters with lactobacillus casei dn 114.001 in fermented milk alters the composition and metabolism of intestinal microflora in  germ-free rats and in human flora-associated rats.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the effects of milk and of various fermented milks on the composition and metabolic activities of the intestinal microflora. groups of eight rats were fed for 6 wk a diet containing 30% nonfermented milk (m), yogurt (y), milk fermented with lactobacillus casei (lcfm) or milk fermented with the association of l. casei dn 114.001 and yogurt starters (lcyfm). in the first study, the survival of the lactic acid bacteria from the fermented milks was assessed by bacterial enumeration in feces of germ-free rats (gf rats) fed milk or fermented milks. the metabolic activities of the lactic acid bacteria were studied in these rats by the measurement of glycolytic activities and products of bacterial fermentation, i.e., acetate and lactate (isoforms l and d). in a second study, the effects of fermented milks on the composition and metabolism [gas, glycolytic activities, short-chain fatty acids (scfa), alcohol and ammonia] of human flora were studied using human flora-associated rats (hf rats). in gf rats, the survival of l. casei in the feces did not differ between those fed the lcfm and lcyfm diets. l. bulgaricus was detected in the feces of the rats fed y, whereas streptoccus thermophilus was found in the feces of the lcyfm group. in hf rats, fecal concentration of bifidobacteria was greater in the lcfm group than in the others. beta-glucuronidase (ec 3.2.1.31) activity was lower in rats fed lcfm and y than in those fed m and lcyfm, whereas beta-galactosidase (3.2.1.23), alpha-glucosidase (ec 3.2.1 20) and beta-glucosidase (ec 3.2.1.21) activities were higher in the lcyfm group compared with the others. methane excretion was higher in rats fed y than in other groups. cecal scfa concentrations did not differ in lcfm, y and m groups, but total scfa, acetate, propionate and butyrate were significantly greater in the lcyfm group. these results suggest that milk fermented with the combination of l. casei and yogurt starters leads to specific effects that are different from the simple addition of the effects found with yogurt and milk fermented with l. casei. these specific effects are potentially beneficial to human health.

AB  == the polymerizable monomer methacryloyloxydodecylpyridinium bromide (mdpb) shows antibacterial activity when immobilized in a resin-based material. in this study, the antibacterial effect of a dentin primer incorporating mdpb was investigated.  the influence of incorporation of mdpb on bond strength to dentin and on the curing performance of the adhesive system was also evaluated. experimental primers were prepared by addition of mdpb into a proprietary primer at 1, 2, or 5%. antibacterial effects of experimental primers were compared with those of control primer and two other proprietary primers by an agar disc-diffusion method and bactericidal activity test. experimental primers produced greater inhibition  zones against streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, and lactobacillus casei than any of three proprietary primers, and inhibition increased as the concentration of mdpb was increased. bactericidal activity of mdpb-containing primers against streptococcus mutans was greater than those of the other three primers, with incorporation of mdpb at 5% showing complete killing of bacteria after 30 s contact. no decrease in tensile bond strength was observed for materials containing mdpb. on the contrary, the primer incorporating 1 and 2% mdpb showed higher bond strength than all the others, including the control (p <  0.05). when the degree of conversion of the complex of primer and adhesive resin  was determined with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, there were no significant differences between any of the experimental primers and the control (p > 0.05). these results indicate that incorporation of the antibacterial monomer mdpb enhanced the antibacterial effect of a proprietary dentin primer before curing, and had no adverse influence on bond strength to dentin and curing of the adhesive system.

TI  == plasmid integration in a wide range of bacteria mediated by the integrase of lactobacillus delbrueckii bacteriophage mv4.
AB  == bacteriophage mv4 is a temperate phage infecting lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. during lysogenization, the phage integrates its genome into the host  chromosome at the 3' end of a trna(ser) gene through a site-specific recombination process (l. dupont et al., j. bacteriol., 177:586-595, 1995). a nonreplicative vector (pmc1) based on the mv4 integrative elements (attp site and integrase-coding int gene) is able to integrate into the chromosome of a wide range of bacterial hosts, including lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus casei  (two strains), lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. integrative recombination of pmc1 into the chromosomes  of all of these species is dependent on the int gene product and occurs specifically at the pmc1 attp site. the isolation and sequencing of pmc1 integration sites from these bacteria showed that in lactobacilli, pmc1 integrated into the conserved trna(ser) gene. in the other bacterial species where this trna gene is less or not conserved; secondary integration sites either in potential protein-coding regions or in intergenic dna were used. a consensus sequence was deduced from the analysis of the different integration sites. the comparison of these sequences demonstrated the flexibility of the integrase for the bacterial integration site and suggested the importance of the trinucleotide  cct at the 5' end of the core in the strand exchange reaction.

TI  == the lac operon of lactobacillus casei contains lact, a gene coding for a protein  of the bg1g family of transcriptional antiterminators.
AB  == the 5' region of the lac operon of lactobacillus casei has been investigated. an  open reading frame of 293 codons, designated lact, was identified upstream of lace. the gene product encoded by lact is related to the family of transcriptional antiterminator proteins, which includes bglg from escherichia coli, arbg from erwinia chrysanthemi, sact, sacy, and lict from bacillus subtilis, and bglr from lactococcus lactis. amino acid sequence identities range  from 35 to 24%, while similarities range from 56 to 47%. the transcriptional start site of the lac operon was identified upstream of lact. the corresponding mrna would contain in the 5' region a sequence with high similarity to the consensus rna binding site of transcriptional antiterminators overlapping a sequence capable of folding into a structure that resembles a rho-independent terminator. lact was shown to be active as an antiterminator in a b. subtilis test system using the sacb target sequence. lact directly precedes lacegf, the genes coding for enzyme iicb, phospho-beta-galactosidase, and enzyme iia, and these genes are followed by a sequence that appears to encode a second rho-independent transcription terminator-like structure. northern hybridizations  with probes against lact, lace, and lacf revealed transcripts of similar sizes for the lac mrnas of several l. casei strains. since the length of the lac mrna is just sufficient to contain lactegf, we conclude that the lac operon of l. casei does not contain the genes of the accessory tagatose-6-phosphate pathway as occurs in the lac operons of lactococcus lactis, streptococcus mutans, or staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == rapid procedure for acid adaptation of oral lactic-acid bacteria and further characterization of the response.
AB  == acid-adaptive responses could be induced readily in oral lactic-acid bacteria by  growing them in batch cultures with excess sugar or more conveniently and rapidly by transferring cells to acidified growth media for the time required for biomass doubling. the response of streptococcus mutans gs-5 was induced in a progressive  rather than all-or-nothing way, and the extent of acid tolerance was inversely related to the ph of the inducing medium over a range from 8.5 to 5. the weak acids fluoride, acetate, or lactate did not measurably enhance acid adaptation, and so the response did not appear to depend primarily on changes in delta ph or  the proton motive force across the cell membrane. transcription and translation to form new proteins did appear to be necessary, as indicated by inhibition of adaptation by rifampin or chloramphenicol and by lack of adaptation by cells suspended in phosphate buffer at ph 5. streptococcus salivarius and lactobacillus casei were acid adapted by the rapid method, and the method appeared to be generally useful for oral lactic-acid bacteria. the rapid induction of the response in multiple oral lactic-acid bacteria suggests that it is of general importance for maintaining a diversity of organisms in the oral microbiota, which is regularly subjected to acid stresses.

AB  == six novel 2-amino-4-oxo-5-[(substituted phenyl)sulfanyl]pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines 7-12 were synthesized as potential inhibitors of thymidylate synthase (ts) and as antitumor and/or antibacterial agents. the analogues contain a 5-thio substituent with a phenyl, 4'-chlorophenyl, 3',4'-dichlorophenyl, 4'-nitrophenyl, 3',4'-dimethoxyphenyl, and 2'-naphthyl on the sulfur, and were synthesized from the key intermediate 2-(pivaloylamino)-4-oxo-6-methylpyrrolo[2,3-d]-pyrimidine, 17. appropriately substituted aryl thiols were appended to the 5-position of 17 via an oxidative addition reaction using iodine, ethanol, and water under conditions which also resulted in the deprotection of the 2-amino group. the compounds were evaluated against human, lactobacillus casei, escherichia coli, streptococcus faecium, and pneumocystis carinii (pc) tss and against human, rat liver (rl), pc, and toxoplasma gondii (tg) dhfrs. the nonclassical analogues with the 3',4'-dichloro and the 4'-nitro substituents in the side chain (9 and 10) were more potent than n-[4-[n-[(2-amino-3,4-dihydro-4-oxo-6-quinazolinyl)methyl]-n-prop- 2-ynylamino]benzoyl]-l-glutamic acid (pddf, 1) and n-[5-[n-[(3,4-dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxo-6-quinazolinyl)methyl]-n- methylamino]-2-thenoyl]-l-glutamic acid (zd1694,2) against human ts. analogues with the 4'-chloro, 3',4'-dimethoxy, and naphthyl side chains (8, 11 and 12) were more potent than the unsubstituted phenyl analogue (7) but less than 2, 9, and 10 by 1 order of magnitude. they were all poor inhibitors of human, rl, and pc dhfrs (ic50 = 10(-5) m) but moderate inhibitors (ic50 = 10(-6) m) of tg dhfr. the 4-nitro analogue, 10 (ec50 1.5 microm), was comparable to pddf in its potency as  an inhibitor of the growth of the fadu human squamous cell carcinoma cell line.

TI  == the establishment of a community of oral bacteria that controls the growth of candida albicans in a chemostat.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to establish and identify a community of oral bacteria that controls the growth of candida albicans in the chemostat. the chemostat was operated under glucose-limiting conditions at a dilution rate of 0.05 h-1 and inoculated with a yeast-free suspension of a tongue scraping. after  a steady state had been reached, it was inoculated with c. albicans to establish  the yeast and determine whether its growth could be contained. the steady-state community comprised the species streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mitis, lactobacillus casei, eubacterium saburreum, veillonella dispar and fusobacterium nucleatum. bacteroides gracilus and haemophilus segnis were also detected but infrequently. yeast growth was suppressed and yeast cells  were lost at the same rate as the theoretical washout rate. it is concluded that  this mixed community of oral bacteria can be used to identify the parameters that maintain the equilibrium between oral bacteria and c. albicans in the oral cavity.

TI  == 2,4-diamino-5-deaza-6-substituted pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine antifolates as potent and selective nonclassical inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductases.
AB  == fifteen novel nonclassical and two classical 2,4-diamino-6-(benzylamino)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine antifolates were synthesized as potential inhibitors of pneumocystis carinii, (pc) toxoplasma gondii, (tg) rat liver (rl), and human (h) recombinant dihydrofolate reductases (dhfr). these analogues lack a 5-methyl substitution which has been shown to be important for increased hdhfr inhibitory activity. in addition, they contain a reversal of the  c9-n10 bridge present in folates and most antifolates. the synthesis of the compounds involved the reaction of 2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine with the sodium salt  of nitromalonaldehyde to afford the key intermediate 2,4-diamino-6-nitropyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine (7), in a single step. reduction of 7  to the 2,4,6-triaminopyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine (8), followed by reductive amination with the appropriate benzaldehydes or phenylacetaldehydes afforded the target compounds. n9 methylation of these analogues was carried out using formaldehyde and sodium cyanoborohydride. the analogues demonstrated significant inhibition of pcdhfr and tgdhfr. n9 methylation significantly increased dhfr inhibitory potency. compound 11, the 3'4'5'-trimethoxy-substituted analogue with a selectivity ratio of 9.4 for tgdhfr (compared to rldhfr) was the most selective analogue of the nonclassical series. compound 22, the n9 methyl 2'5'-dimethoxy-substituted analogue was the most potent analogue against tgdhfr (ic 50 = 6.3 nm) and was the second most selective analogue for tgdhfr (compared  to rldhfr) in the nonclassical series. the naphthyl-substituted analogues 23-25 were generally more potent against rldhfr than against pcdhfr and tgdhfr. selected analogues were also evaluated against streptococcus faecium (sf) dhfr, escherichia coli (ec) dhfr, lactobacillus casei (lc) dhfr and tgdhfr with hdhfr as the mammalian reference, under slightly different assay conditions than those  employed for rldhfr. analogues 11 and 22 had selectivity ratios of greater than 100 for tgdhfr (compared to hdhfr). analogue 22 in particular, was the most selective analogue of the nonclassical series against tgdhfr (selectivity ratio = 303.5) with excellent potency (28 nm). analogue 11, also displayed significant selectivity for sfdhfr (selectivity ratio = 4902). compound 22 was evaluated in vivo for the inhibition of the growth of t.gondii trophozoites in mice, where at  50 mg/kg orally, it demonstrated distinct prolongation of survival without toxicity. compounds 11, 12 and 21-23 were evaluated as antitumor agents in the national cancer institutes preclinical in vitro screening program. compounds 12,  22, and 23 showed gi50s for tumor growth inhibition in the 10 -6 - 10 -7 m range.

TI  == an in vitro microbial model for studying secondary caries formation.
AB  == secondary caries is a major reason for the replacement of restorations. because it is hypothesized that the development of secondary caries is closely associated with pathogenic oral bacteria, an in vitro microbial model has been developed to  produce secondary carious lesions. a mixture of overnight cultures of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus casei in dextrose-free trypticase soy broth, supplemented with 5% sucrose (tsbs), at 37 degrees c was used in this model as the inoculum for the experimental groups. uninoculated control groups were incubated with medium only. groups of human tooth specimens restored using composite, together with their respective controls, were exposed for 7 or 12 days to circulating cycles of tsbs (30 min each, 3 times per day) and a mineral wash solution (for a total of 22.5 h per day), at 37 degrees c. the ph of the experimental groups dropped to 4.l-4.5 during the test periods. the ph of the control groups remained at 6.8-7.0. the inoculated bacteria remained viable throughout the study. no contamination of experimental or control samples occurred. laser scanning confocal microscopy demonstrated the development of incipient surface and wall lesions in all the specimens of experimental groups in as few as 7 days. reproducibility of the model was confirmed in a second investigation. therefore, it was concluded that this model can be used for studying the microbial etiology and prevention of secondary caries.

AB  == the ability of lactobacillus casei, streptococcus sobrinus, actinomyces viscosus, and streptococcus salivarius to induce dental caries was determined in vitro. a class i cavity (depth: 2mm) was prepared in extracted human caries-free premolars to make dentin blocks. the blocks were inoculated with these four bacterial strains in a monoinfective fashion and were incubated under anaerobic conditions. in addition to the monoinfection groups, mixed-infection groups of l. casei with  s. sobrinus or a. viscosus were also prepared. half of the culture medium was renewed every 3 days, and the ph of the medium was measured. after 4 or 12 wk, these dentin blocks were prepared by brown-brenn staining and by contact microradiography for light microscopic observation and for immunohistochemical staining. the final ph of the s. salivarius group was the highest among the experimental groups, at approximately 5.1; that of the others was approximately 4.3. bacterial invasion into the dentinal tubules was observed in all but the s.  salivarius group. among the monoinfection groups, the s. sobrinus group showed the highest invasion rate, followed by the a. viscosus group and the l. casei group. the invasion rate was also high in the mixed-infection groups. immunohistochemical staining revealed invasion only by l. casei, and not by s. sobrinus and a. viscosus. the invasion rate by l. casei was higher in the mixed-infection group with either s. sobrinus or a. viscosus than in the monoinfection groups. these findings suggest that lactobacillus might play an important role in the initiation and progress of dentinal caries, and that this bacterial species might exhibit a cooperative cariogenicity when it coexists with other bacterial species that surpasses its individual cariogenicity.

AB  == in streptococcus salivarius, the phosphoenolpyruvate (pep):mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system, which concomitantly transports and phosphorylates mannose, glucose, fructose, and 2-deoxyglucose, is composed of the general energy-coupling proteins ei and hpr, the specific membrane-bound iiiman, and two  forms of a protein called iiiman, with molecular weights of 38,900 (iiimanh) and  35,200 (iiimanl), that are found in the cytoplasm as well as associated with the  membrane. several lines of evidence suggest that iiimanh and/or iiimanl are involved in the control of sugar metabolism. to determine whether other bacteria  possess these proteins, we tested for their presence in 28 oral streptococcus strains, 3 nonoral streptococcus strains, 2 lactococcus strains, 2 enterococcus strains, 2 bacillus strains, 1 lactobacillus strain, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. three approaches were used to determine whether the iiiman proteins were present in these bacteria: (i) western blot (immunoblot) analysis of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins, using anti-iiimanh and anti-iiimanh rabbit  polyclonal antibodies; (ii) analysis of pep-dependent phosphoproteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; and (iii) inhibition by anti-iiiman antibodies of the pep-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose (a mannose analog) by crude cellular extracts. only the species s. salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis possessed the two forms of iiiman. fifteen other streptococcal species possessed one protein with a molecular weight between 35,200 and 38,900 that cross-reacted with both antibodies. in the case of 9 species, a protein possessing the same electrophoretic mobility was phosphorylated at the expense of pep. no such phosphoprotein, however, could be detected in the other six species. a iii(man)-like protein with a molecular weight of 35,500 was also detected in lactobacillus casei by western blot experiments as well as by pep-dependent phosphoprotein analysis, and a protein with a molecular weight of 38,900 that cross-reacted with anti-iii(man) antibodies was detected in lactococcus lactis. in several cases, the involvement  of these putative iii(man) proteins in the pep-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose was substantiated by the inhibition of phosphorylation activity of anti-iii(man) antibodies. no proteins cross-reacting with anti-iii(man) antibodies were detected in enterococci, bacilli, and e. coli. in s. aureus, a membrane protein with a molecular weight of 50,000 reacted strongly with the antibodies. this protein, however, was not phosphorylated at the expense of pep.

'fluoride-bound hydroxyapatite' (fha) and 'fluoride-free hydroxyapatite' (ha) rods were prepared as test and control surfaces, respectively. biofilms of s. mutans bm71, a. naeslundii genospecies 2 wvu627, and l. casei bm225 accumulated on the surfaces of rods in a semi-defined, mucin-based medium in a chemostat. culture conditions were varied from ph 4.5 to 7.0 under carbon (glucose) limitation and excess, at a dilution rate of d = 0.1 h-1. low environmental ph reduced both the numbers of cells on ha surfaces during the early phases (from 0 to 2 h) of accumulation and the final numbers of cells in mature biofilms (20 h). the initial adherence of cells was unaffected by surface  fluoride under any of the conditions tested. similarly, biofilm cells under carbon limitation and those under carbon excess at ph 7.0 were not affected by surface fluoride. however, at low environmental ph values, ph 5.5 for s. mutans and ph 6.0 for a. naeslundii under glucose excess, the accumulation of biofilm cells on the fha surfaces was significantly reduced (p < 0.05-0.001). biofilm cell number doubling times of s. mutans and a. naeslundii were increased on fha relative to ha. biofilms of l. casei were not significantly affected, even at ph  4.5 in glucose excess. the results confirmed that fluoride from the substratum affected fluoride-sensitive biofilm cells but only under conditions of glucose excess ad low ph.

TI  == characterisation of lactic acid bacteria isolated from naturally fermented greek  dry salami.
AB  == a total of 348 lactic acid bacteria isolated from five batches of naturally fermented dry salami at various stages of ripening were characterised. the majority of the strains were assigned to two main phylogenetic groups of species: (i) the psychrotrophic, formerly called atypical, meat streptobacteria (169 strains) and (ii) a new genus weissella (120), which was recently proposed (collins et al., 1993) to include leuconostoc paramesenteroides and some other closely related species. meat streptobacteria were identified as lactobacillus curvatus (88 strains) and l. sake (76), whereas 5 strains were indistinguishable  and, thus designated l. sake/curvatus. non-psychrotrophic streptobacteria were also isolated and identified as l. plantarum (34 strains), l. farciminis (10), l. coryniformis (1) and l. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (1). the majority of the weissella strains (86) were leuconostoc-like bacteria; four of them were identified as w. viridescens, 11 belonged to the newly described w. hellenica (collins et al., 1993), another 11 resembled w. paramesenteroides, whereas 60 isolates were not classified to any species. the latter group comprised strains that produced d(l)-lactate. the remaining weissella were gas-forming, arginine-positive rods assigned to w. minor (31) and w. halotolerans (3). other species identified were enterococcus faecium (10), leuconostoc mesenteroides (1), l. brevis (1) and pediococcus sp. (1). the main criteria used to distinguish between above species as well as their distribution on the five salami batches in relation to their succession with time and suitability as starters were discussed.

TI  == killing of cariogenic bacteria by light from a gallium aluminium arsenide diode laser.
AB  == suspensions of streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus casei and actinomyces viscosus were exposed to light from a gallium aluminium arsenide laser in the presence of aluminium disulphonated phthalocyanine and the numbers of survivors determined. exposure to the laser light in the absence of the dye, or the dye in the absence of the laser light, had no significant effect on the viability of the organisms. however, a light-dose-related decrease in the viable  count of all four target organisms was found on exposure to the laser light in the presence of the dye. the kills attributable to lethal photosensitization amounted to approximately 10(6) cfu in the case of each organisms. as appreciable kills were achieved within clinically convenient exposure times (30-90 s), these  results imply that lethal photosensitization may be a useful technique for eliminating bacteria from carious lesions prior to restoration.

AB  == the displacement of enterococcus faecalis 1131 from hydrophobic and hydrophilic substrata by isolates of lactobacillus casei 36 and streptococcus hyointestinalis km1 was studied in a parallel plate flow chamber. the experiments were conducted  with either 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer or human urine as the suspending fluid, and adhesion and displacement were measured by real-time in situ image analysis. the results showed that e. faecalis 1131 was displaced by lactobacilli  (31%) and streptococci (74%) from fluorinated ethylene propylene in buffer and that displacement by lactobacilli was even more effective on a glass substratum in urine (54%). the passage of an air-liquid interface significantly impacted on  adhesion, especially when the surface had been challenged with lactobacilli (up to 100% displacement) or streptococci (up to 94% displacement). these results showed that the parallel plate flow system with real-time in situ image analysis  was effective for studying bacterial adhesion and that uropathogenic enterococci  can be displaced by indigenous bacteria.

TI  == an in vitro model for adhesion of bacteria to human tooth root surfaces.
AB  == a model mimicking bacterial colonization of dentine has been developed. it employs uniform particles of pulverized human tooth root tissue incubated with radioactively labelled bacteria. after incubation, the number of attaching bacteria is quantified. attachment of streptococcus mutans ua140, actinomyces viscosus t14, and lactobacillus casei 101 was found to be time dependent and complete within 1-3 h. dissociation constants (kd) of the interactions equalled 2.5 x 10(8) and 1.6 x 10(8) cells/ml, for strep. mutants and a. viscosus, respectively. the kd for l. casei could not be determined as attachment was not saturable. the putative tissue components involved in adherence were studied by determining the attachment of bacteria in the presence of competing strains. the  results suggest that strep. mutans and a. viscosus recognized and competed for the same ligand (probably collagen) in the dentine. l. casei attachment did not complete with the attachment of strep. mutans and a. viscosus. attachment of all  strains was modified by preincubation with saliva and varied with bacterial strain and saliva donor.

TI  == bacterial colonization and degradation of demineralized dentin matrix in situ.
AB  == lesion formation in dentin involves demineralization followed by degradation of the exposed organic matrix. proteinases from microorganisms present in the dentin are believed to play an important role in the breakdown of the dentinal collagen. in this study, the microflora colonizing decalcified dentin matrix, placed in situ, was identified. the gelatinolytic activity of the isolated strains was assessed and related to the degradation of the dentin matrix. the predominant species found were streptococcus mitis. peptostreptococcus productus, lactobacillus casei, propionibacterium species and veillonella parvula. marked interindividual variation in the composition of the microflora was observed. the  microflora possessed gelatinolytic activity, although no correlation was found with the severity of dentin matrix degradation. the chemically determined loss of collagen varied between 0 and 67 wt% per participant and corresponded with the extent of collagen degradation observed by transmission electron microscopy.

TI  == the effects of triclosan and zinc citrate, alone and in combination, on a community of oral bacteria grown in vitro.
AB  == a mixed-culture chemostat system has been used as a more stringent laboratory system for evaluation of the antimicrobial effects of triclosan and zinc citrate. the inhibitors were added alone, and in combination, as a pulse (a high initial inhibitor concentration which decreased with time) or as a dose (concentration of inhibitor increased with time) to give maximum concentrations of 34.5 mumol/l triclosan and 39.8 mumol/l zinc citrate. when dosed, triclosan inhibited a. viscosus and all five gram-negative species, whereas zinc citrate had less effect, probably due to complexation by media components. similar effects were seen when triclosan was pulsed, except that s. mutans was the most sensitive gram-positive species and v. dispar was unaffected. however, when the inhibitors  were dosed or pulsed in combination, marked complementary and additive inhibitory effects were observed, particularly against gram-negative species, although s. gordonii and s. oralis were relatively unaffected. the data confirm that increased effects can be obtained with suitable combinations of antimicrobial agents and suggest that, under certain conditions, apparently broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents may be acting more selectively than hitherto suspected.

TI  == nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the lacr, lacabcd, and lacfe genes encoding the repressor, tagatose 6-phosphate gene cluster, and sugar-specific phosphotransferase system components of the lactose operon of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the complete nucleotide sequences of lacrabcdf and partial nucleotide sequence of lace from the lactose operon of streptococcus mutans are presented. comparison of the streptococcal lac determinants with those of staphylococcus aureus and lactococcus lactis indicate exceptional protein and nucleotide identity. the deduced polypeptides also demonstrate significant, but lower, sequence similarity with the corresponding lactose proteins of lactobacillus casei. additionally, lacr has sequence homology with the repressor (deor) of the escherichia coli deoxyribonucleotide operon, while lacc is similar to phosphokinases (fruk and pfkb) from e. coli. the primary translation products of the lacrabcdfe genes are  polypeptides of 251 (m(r) 28,713), 142 (m(r) 15,610), 171 (m(r) 18,950), 310 (m(r) 33,368), 325 (m(r) 36,495), 104 (m(r) 11,401), and 123 (nh2-terminal) amino acids, respectively. as inferred from their direct homology to the staphylococcal lac genes, these determinants would encode the repressor of the streptococcal lactose operon (lacr), galactose-6-phosphate isomerase (laca and lacb), tagatose-6-phosphate kinase (lacc), tagatose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (lacd), and the sugar-specific components enzyme iii-lactose (lacf) and enzyme ii-lactose (lace) of the s. mutans phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system.  the nucleotide sequence encompassing the s. mutans lac promoter appears to contain repeat elements analogous to those of s. aureus, suggesting that repression and catabolite repression of the lactose operons may be similar in these organisms.

AB  == this review summarizes experiments on the endogenous induction of tumor necrosis  factor (tnf) in mice by various biological response modifiers and bacterial preparations, such as heat-killed streptococcus pyogenes (ok-432) or lactobacillus casei (lc). intravenous administration of ok-432 or lc transiently  elicited endogenous tnf in mice. the endogenous tnf production was significantly  enhanced by priming (pretreatment) with high molecular-weight lignins or polysaccharides, but not by phenylpropenoid precursors or partially hydrolyzed products of glucans. when stimulated with lignins and ok-432, tumor-bearing and aged mice produced much lower amounts of tnf than normal and young mice. endogenously produced tnf was concentrated more in serum, liver and lungs, than in other organs. on the other hand, a much lower concentration of il-1alpha was induced in the serum fraction, whereas significant amounts of this cytokine were  detected in liver and lungs. histochemical examination revealed significant increase in the number and swelling of kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelium in the liver of the treated mice. the results suggest the possible efficacy of applying endogenous tnf production for the treatment of human cancer patients.

TI  == humoral igg antibodies to oral microbiota in a population at risk for root-surface caries.
AB  == mutans streptococci have been strongly implicated in the initiation of dental caries on coronal surfaces. their role in development of root-surface caries is less clear. the etiologic agents of both types of dental caries are likely to elicit systemic immune responses. the objective of the present study, therefore,  was to study the association of clinical variables of disease with humoral igg antibodies to nine oral micro-organisms in 314 adult subjects, aged 45-65 years,  who were at risk for root-surface caries. antibody activity to streptococcus mutans strain ingbritt, s. mutans/s. sobrinus gtfs, s. faecalis strain 19433, actinomyces viscosus strain wvu 626, actinomyces naeslundii strain 12, lactobacillus casei, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strain y4, porphyromonas gingivalis strain 381, eikenella corrodens strain 1073, and wolinella recta strain 371 was measured by elisa. pearson correlation coefficients among log10 antibody levels within subjects revealed marked positive correlations among subgingival bacteria, generally weak positive correlations among supragingival micro-organisms, and no correlations between elements of the  supragingival battery with the subgingival battery. igg antibody levels to mutans streptococcal antigens were significantly correlated with subject dmf scores (r = 0.23; p less than 0.0001). no significant correlation was seen between dmf scores and antibody to any other supragingival micro-organism tested. further relationships between levels of s. mutans antibody and individual clinical variables were analyzed by step-wise multiple linear regression, resulting in a model that was highly significant (p = 0.0001), with an r2 = 0.14. numbers of missing teeth, coronal caries, root-surface caries, and root-surface restorations were each positively associated with antibody levels to mutans streptococci.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == modulation of human neutrophil adherence by oral bacteria.
AB  == polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmns) comprise over 90 per cent of leukocytes in the oral cavity. although these phagocytic cells have primary defence roles in the gingiva, their stimulation by micro-organisms may also cause substantial tissue damage due to the release of lysosomal enzymes and oxygen radicals. adherence of pmns to the endothelium and their subsequent diapedesis and egress to areas of infection are considered early vital events in the inflammatory process. in this study, oral bacteria were screened to determine their direct effects on pmn activation using an in vitro method of measuring pmn adherence to  dacron fibres. most of the bacteria investigated increased pmn adherence, indicating their potential to cause tissue damage through the release of pmn lysosomal enzymes and other products. in contrast, bacteroides species suppressed pmns, indicating their ability to circumvent the phagocytic cells, thus gaining a potential advantage in dental colonization. the modulatory effects of oral bacteria on pmn activation may have significant roles in the immunopathogenesis of oral disease.

AB  == the function of peritoneal macrophages induced by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of attenuated streptococcus pyogenes (ok-432), bacillus calmette guerin (bcg), protein-bound polysaccharide preparation isolated from coriolus vesicolor  (psk) or lactobacillus casei was examined. the pma-triggered respiratory burst (production of o2- and h2o2) of macrophages induced by ok-432, bcg or lac. casei  was greater than that of resident or thioglycollate-stimulated macrophages and was similar to that of bcg-activated macrophages. psk failed to enhance the production of o2- or h2o2 by macrophages. alkaline phosphodiesterase (apd) activity was reduced in macrophages induced by ok-432, bcg or lac. casei injection and in bcg-activated macrophages. the apd activity of macrophages obtained 7 and 13 days after i.p. injection of psk was elevated, as with thioglycollate-stimulated macrophages. listericidal activity in vitro was enhanced in macrophages obtained in 13 and 7 days, but suppressed in macrophages  obtained 2 days after ok-432, bcg or lac. casei injection. lac. casei administered either 2 or 13 days before infection with listeria monocytogenes was protective but ok-432, bcg (0.1 mg) and psk were not, even though they were able  to stimulate macrophage function.

TI  == antibodies in normal and diseased pulps reactive with microorganisms isolated from deep caries.
AB  == immunoglobulin molecules in the supernatant fluids (sf) from pulpal explant cultures have been observed to react with microorganisms implicated in infections of root canals. in this study, the reactivity of immunoglobulin molecules in the  sf from normal and irreversible pulpitis pulps to six strains of predominant microorganisms isolated from the immediate layer of carious lesions above the pulps used for explant cultures was investigated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. two atcc strains of eubacterium were also included in this assay. specific antibodies to lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus (i), (ii), streptococcus mutans, bacteroides intermedius, eubacterium brachy, and eubacterium alactolyticum in the sf from the normal and irreversible pulpitis tissues were observed with a large variation of antibody levels in both groups. immunodiffusion assays of the sf revealed that igg was the major class of immunoglobulin in the normal as well as the irreversible groups. the presence of  natural antibodies in the normal pulps suggested a possible protective role of antibodies during the invasive process of caries.

TI  == multibacterial artificial plaque. a model for studying carious process.
AB  == a multibacterial artificial plaque was established in vitro on enamel slabs incubated in mixed culture of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans (serotype c), streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus casei and actinomyces viscosus. typical structure same as natural plaque was seen under microscope. the caries-like lesion produced under the plaque was observed in enamel sections. the lesion was similar in appearance to natural ones under optic and scanning electron microscopes. the acids produced in both culture media and artificial plaque were similar in composition and type to those produced in natural plaque after sugar attack. it is suggested that this kind of plaque model may be useful  in studying carious process in vitro, because it is easily controlled either by changing the composition of bacteria or by adding different kinds of nutrient in  the media. moreover, the results will be easier to explain than those produced in natural ones.

TI  == inhibition of microbial adherence and growth by various glass ionomers in vitro.
AB  == this study measured the in vitro inhibition of growth and adherence of five oral  bacteria by glass-ionomer materials. disks were prepared from two cavity liners and four restorative class materials, by use of teflon plates with circular wells, five mm wide and two mm deep. the bacterial species tested included: a. viscosus, s. mitis, s. mutans, l. casei, and s. sanguis. growth inhibition studies were performed by the spreading of 0.1 ml of standardized inocula over agar plates produced with selective media, followed by the direct application of  glass-ionomer disks onto the agar. on other plates, disks were placed onto uninoculated agars for 48 h, followed by bacterial inoculation. all agar plates were incubated under optimal growth conditions for each bacterial species. the four restorative materials were also placed aseptically into sterilized bovine incisors and placed into sucrose containing broth media, inoculated with s. mutans for three days. adhering materials were disclosed and scored. an ion-exchange electrode was used to measure fluoride release over a seven-day period for all six glass ionomers. the two cavity liners and two of the restorative materials produced the largest growth inhibition zones by direct contact. no growth inhibition occurred when the specimens were allowed to come into contact with the agars prior to inoculation. all four restorative materials  reduced bacterial accumulations on enamel surfaces by over 80%. elevations in short-term fluoride release levels were positively correlated with growth inhibition.

TI  == noncariogenicity of erythritol as a substrate.
AB  == erythritol is a sugar alcohol produced by aureobasidium sp. from glucose. it is 75-80% as sweet as sucrose and is also nonhygroscopic. the aim of this study was  to evaluate this sugar substitute from a cariological point of view. erythritol was neither utilized as a substrate for the lactic acid production nor for plaque formation of mutans streptococci (serotypes a-h) and certain oral microorganisms. it was not utilized for water-insoluble glucan synthesis or cellular adherence by glucosyltransferase from streptococcus mutans ps-14 (c) and streptococcus sobrinus 6715 (g). finally, a significantly lower caries score (3.1 +/- 0.5; mean +/- sem) was observed in specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. sobrinus 6715 and fed with a diet containing 26% erythritol, as compared to control rats fed with a diet containing 26% sucrose (60.5 +/- 2.0). also, rats provided a diet containing 56% erythritol chocolate (23.8% erythritol) and challenged with s. mutans ps-14 exhibited a significantly lower caries score (6.7 +/- 0.8) compared  to the sucrose chocolate group (82.8 +/- 2.8). the main conclusion from this study is therefore that erythritol is a promising sugar substitute from a cariological point of view.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of a dental varnish, in vitro.
AB  == the effects of a polymer based antimicrobial releasing varnish cervitec were investigated against different gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains  as well as a yeast using the agar diffusion inhibitory test (adt-test in vitro).  as positive controls a 1% chlorhexidine gel and 1% aqueous solution of thymol and a placebo polymer varnish without active agents were employed. the test experimental varnish containing 1% chlorhexidine and 1% thymol showed antimicrobial activity against all gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms tested including one candida strain. the positive controls were similar in effect compared to the test varnish. no antimicrobial effect was observed with the placebo varnish without active ingredients. toothpicks and dental floss treated with the test varnish showed an antimicrobial effect against s. mutans even after storing in room temperature up to 12 months. the results from this study support  earlier laboratory studies that chlorhexidine and thymol diffuse out of the experimental varnish and that the varnish is active against various of oral pathogens. the possibility to use toothpicks or dental floss impregnated with the varnish with the aim to become chemotherapeutically active against periodontal diseases as well as against dental caries, is promising and should be tested in vivo.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial effect of chlorhexidine added to glass-ionomer cements.
AB  == the aims of the present study were to investigate the antibacterial properties of glass-ionomer cements containing different concentrations of chlorhexidine and the possible release of chlorhexidine from the compound. chlorhexidine gluconate  or diacetate was mixed with glass-ionomer cements and tested in vitro against strains of lactobacillus casei and mutans streptococci. a spectrophotometric test was used to monitor the release of chlorhexidine from the mixture. in a broth culture test, the higher the concentrations of chlorhexidine in the mixture, the  longer the time of antibacterial effect on streptococcus mutans and the greater the tendency of the material to deteriorate. agar diffusion tests revealed bacterial inhibition in a dose-response manner. the tested bacterial strains were similarly inhibited and the antibacterial properties decreased with time. a minor portion of added chlorhexidine was released from the cement. the deterioration of the cements indicates that the material could be useful as a varnish-like chlorhexidine carrier.

TI  == pteroylpolyglutamates in human milk.
AB  == considerable variation exists in reported values for total folate content and the pteroylpolyglutamate (pteglun) content of human milk. we investigated possible methodological sources of this variation. in two laboratories, milk folate content (with and without folate conjugase) was determined microbiologically. no  differences in total milk folate or pteglun (n greater than 3) content were found between laboratories. pteglun was found to comprise a significant fraction of total milk folate (28%). use of rennin did not alter total folate content nor the percent of pteglun in human milk. heating (121 degrees c for 5 min) increased folate concentrations (190%, p less than 0.0001), indicating that release of folate from binding protein is necessary for folate utilization by lactobacillus  casei. although human milk folate conjugase, (fc) activity was approximately one-twentieth that of plasma fc activity, it was not sufficient to autolyze endogenous pteglun. thus, microbiological protocols that do not use folate conjugase and do not release folate from binding proteins will seriously underestimate milk folate values.

TI  == mobility of the spin-labeled side chains of some novel antifolate inhibitors in their complexes with dihydrofolate reductase.
AB  == four spin-labeled inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) have been synthesized, each of which has the 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (tempo) reporting group at a different distance from the 2,4-diaminopyrimidine moiety by  which the inhibitors are anchored and oriented in the active site. inhibitors in  which the tempo group is attached by a short side chain are weakly bound to dhfr  from bacteria (streptococcus faecium and lactobacillus casei), to the bovine enzyme and to recombinant human dhfr. however, binding is sufficiently tight, especially in the ternary complexes with nadph, for recording of the epr spectra  of the bound ligands. the spectra indicate that when these inhibitors are bound to the enzyme the tempo group is highly immobilized with correlation time, tau c, 4-20ns. inhibitors that have the reporter group attached to the glutamate moiety  of methotrexate bind to all four dhfrs more tightly than the inhibitors with shorter side chains by factors of up to 10(6). however, in most complexes formed  by the inhibitors with longer side chains immobilization of the tempo group is slight (tau c 0.2-4 ns). these results are in general agreement with predictions  from x-ray crystallographic results including thermal factors but there are some  unanticipated differences between some results for bacterial and eukaryotic enzymes. three of the splin-labeled inhibitors would provide good probes for distance measurements in and around the active site of mammalian dhfr.

AB  == streptococcus mutans, strep. sobrinus and lactobacillus casei were grown in glucose-supplemented, sterilized, human whole saliva, adjusted to ph 5, 6 or 7. components of the antibacterial peroxidase system--hypothiocyanous acid (hoscn) and hypothiocyanite ions (oscn-)--were generated by adding exogenous h2o2 to sterilized saliva containing endogenous peroxidases and thiocyanate (scn-) ions.  hoscn/oscn- generation was proportional to the amount of h2o2 added, and more hoscn/oscn- was detected in saliva at ph 7 than at ph 5. however, the growth of mutans streptococci and l. casei was inhibited at ph 5 by hoscn/oscn-, whereas no inhibition was found at ph 7. the findings show that (a) sufficient amount of hoscn/oscn- will inhibit the growth of cariogenic bacteria in human saliva at ph  5; (b) this amount of hoscn/oscn- can be generated in saliva by exogenously added h2o2; and (c) peroxidase systems have stronger antistreptococcal effects in human whole saliva than in phosphate buffer.

TI  == sugar, fluoride, ph and microbial homeostasis in dental plaque.
AB  == factors that may contribute to the maintenance or breakdown of the oral microflora have been studied in the laboratory using a mixed culture chemostat system. carbohydrate type had relatively little influence of the proportions of individual species at neutral ph. in contrast, when the ph was allowed to fall following carbohydrate metabolism, the stability of the microflora was markedly perturbed. the proportions of streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei and veillonella dispar increased and they became the predominant species, while levels of other gram-negative organisms and s. gordonii declined. low levels (1 mmol/l) of sodium fluoride (naf) had little effect on the microflora at neutral ph. however, when the ph fell following carbohydrate metabolism, 1 mmol/l of naf  slowed acid production and, in so doing, reduced the inhibition of acid-sensitive species, and suppressed the selection of s. mutans under otherwise favourable conditions. these data (and others) suggest that the mode of action of fluoride in human beings might include a subtle but clinically significant antimicrobial effect. these findings have also led to the proposal of a modified hypothesis (the "ecological plaque hypothesis") to explain the role of the resident oral microflora in dental disease. the hypothesis also has implications for treatment  and prevention strategies.

AB  == we show in this article that the transport of glucose, mannose and fructose by the phosphoenolpyruvate: mannose phosphotransferase system of oral streptococci requires the participation of a protein component that we have called iiiman. this protein was purified from streptococcus salivarius by chromatography on deae-cellulose, deae-tsk, hydroxyapatite, and dyematrex green a. the purified protein migrated as a 38,900 molecular weight protein on a sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel. however, electrophoretic analysis of phosphoproteins and western blot experiments indicated the presence in membrane-free cellular extracts of s. salivarius of 2 different forms of iiiman having molecular weights of 38,900 and 35,200. the presence of the high-molecular-weight form of iiiman was observed by immunodiffusion, western blot and phosphorylation by [32]pep in s. salivarius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, and streptococcus lactis but not in streptococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis and lactobacillus casei. antibodies directed against the iiiman of s. salivarius  did not react with the iiiman of escherichia coli.

TI  == microflora associated with experimental root surface caries in humans.
AB  == this study describes the microflora from actively progressing root surface caries lesions, in which mineral loss had been determined by quantitative microradiography. the caries lesions were produced experimentally in root surface specimens from human molars inserted in lower partial dentures carried for 3 months by six elderly individuals. a total of 780 bacterial isolates were identified from 13 plaque samples, collected with a punch technique, and six dentin samples. the composition of the microflora showed distinct individual differences. the microflora from plaque samples associated with the highest mineral loss was dominated by either actinomyces viscosus or a combination of mutans streptococci (serotypes c, d, and f) and lactobacillus species (l. casei and l. brevis). plaque from root surfaces with less pronounced mineral loss harbored a more complex microflora comprising gram-positive rods, mutans streptococci, streptococcus mitis biovar 1, veillonella spp., gram-negative rods, and low numbers of lactobacilli. in the latter samples, individual variations in  the proportions of mutans streptococci (serotypes c, d, and g), actinomyces species (a. viscosus and a. naeslundii), and veillonella parvula biotypes were observed. these findings suggest that certain species or combinations of species  are more cariogenic than others and that dominance of single acidogenic species in particular is conducive to high caries activity.

TI  == influence of aflatoxin b1 on gas production by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the main characteristic of homofermentative lactic acid bacteria is that they do  not produce gas from glucose and other sugars. however, in these experiments lactobacillus casei, lb. plantarum and streptococcus lactis in broth media with glucose, galactose, lactose and sucrose, and aflatoxin b1 produces acid and also  a significant amount of gas. in the control media without aflatoxin, these bacteria did not produce gas. the data suggest that lactic acid bacteria, known until now as homofermentative, become heterofermentative because of the influence of aflatoxin b1. the results of these investigations are of practical value because they may explain the defect of cheese "blowing," which can appear in trapist cheese vacuum packed in foil. this type of unusual "blowing" occurs approximately one month after cheese manufacture. this defect can be characterized by very large holes and cracks inside the cheese. the flavor is similar to that of young cheese, which can be very undesirable for a ripened, trapist, aged cheese.

TI  == role of aspartate 27 of dihydrofolate reductase from escherichia coli in interconversion of active and inactive enzyme conformers and binding of nadph.
AB  == the apoenzyme of wild-type (wt) dihydrofolate reductase (dhrf) from escherichia coli exists in two conformational states, et and ew, which differ in affinity for nadph and in kinetic competence. dissociation constants for the binary complex of nadph with the two conformers differ by over 100-fold (kdt = 0.17 microm, kdw = 22 microm). rate constants governing the interconversion of conformers are small  (t1/2 for ew----et = 71 s), and since ew is not catalytically competent, this conversion is accompanied by an increase in catalytic velocity. the equilibrium proportion of et in the absence of ligands is 63%, but binding of nadph greatly increases this proportion, and t1/2 for conversion of ew.nadph to et.nadph is 30  s. this conformational equilibrium has also been examined in mutant enzyme in which aspartate 27 is replaced by asparagine (d27n e. coli dhfr). although asp27  is an active site residue, it does not interact directly with bound nadph, and in the mutant the rate constant for nadph binding to et is unchanged as are the dissociation constants for nadph complexes with et or ew. however, for mutant apoenzyme, the proportion of et is decreased to 18% in the absence of ligands so  that the overall kd for nadph is increased (0.15 microm for wt e. coli dhfr, 0.68 microm for d27n e. coli dhfr). the lower proportion of et is due to a decreased rate for ew----et (t1/2 = 221 s) and an increased rate for et----ew (t1/2 = 50 s  versus 120 s for wt e. coli dhfr).

TI  == inhibition of proton-translocating atpases of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus casei by fluoride and aluminum.
AB  == one of the major effects of fluoride on oral bacteria is a reduction in acid tolerance, and presumably also in cariogenicity. the reduction appears to involve transport of protons across the cell membrane by the weak acid hf to dissipate the ph gradient, and also direct inhibition of the f1f0, proton-translocating atpases of the organisms, especially for streptococcus mutans. this direct inhibition by fluoride was found to be dependent on aluminum. the dependence on aluminum was indicated by the protection against fluoride inhibition afforded by  the al-chelator deferoxamine and by loss of protection after addition of umolar levels of al3+, which were not inhibitory for the enzyme in the absence of fluoride. the f1 form of the enzyme dissociated from the cell membrane previously had been found to be resistant to fluoride in comparison with the f1f0 membrane-associated form. however, this difference appeared to depend on less aluminum in the f1 preparation in that the sensitivity of the f1 enzyme to fluoride could be increased by addition of umolar levels of al3+. the effects of  al on fluoride inhibition were apparent when enzyme activity was assayed in terms of phosphate release from atp or with an atp-regenerating system containing phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate kinase, nadh and lactic dehydrogenase. also, be2+ but not other metal cations, e.g. co2+, fe2+, fe3+, mn2, sn2+, and zn2+, served to sensitize the enzyme to fluoride inhibition. the differences in sensitivities  of enzymes isolated from various oral bacteria found previously appeared also to  be related to differences in levels of al.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the acid production from sorbitol and glucose was studied under anaerobic conditions in resting cell suspensions of bacteria from the predominant sorbitol-fermenting human dental plaque flora, belonging to the genera streptococcus, lactobacillus and actinomyces. the acid production activity of the bacterial cells was followed by titration with alkali, at environmental ph 7.0, 6.0 and 5.0 after addition of carbohydrate solution. the metabolic end products formed in the suspensions were analyzed thereafter by isotachophoretic and enzymatic methods. the results showed that sorbitol was fermented at a slower rate than glucose. lowering the environmental ph decreased the acid production activity from the two carbohydrates. compared with glucose, the catabolism of sorbitol was affected to greater extent by the ph conditions. the total amount of acids formed from sorbitol was considerably less than from glucose. lactic acid,  which was the major end product in glucose-challenged suspensions, was produced only in low concentrations from sorbitol by all strains tested. the ratio strong  (formic + lactic)/weak acids was moreover lower for sorbitol than for glucose. the present results further illustrate some of the mechanisms behind the low cariogenic potential of this sugar substitute.

AB  == during a 2-yr study period samples from saliva, the tongue, and 276 interdental spaces were obtained from 23 7-yr-old children in order to (a) relate the presence of lactobacilli in various oral sites to the occurrence of lactobacilli  in saliva, and (b) relate the presence of mutans streptococci and various types of lactobacilli interdentally to the development of proximal carious lesions. the results showed an increased number of interdental samples containing lactobacilli with an increasing number of salivary lactobacilli. furthermore, lactobacilli were never found interdentally without the presence of mutans streptocci, lactobacilli proved to be the more suitable microorganism for prediction of proximal carious lesions. neither the number nor the differentiation into different species of interdental lactobacilli seemed to be of importance, but simply whether they were present. the presence of lactobacilli probably reflects  a caries-inducing environment (etiologic microflora + fermentable carbohydrates), thus explaining their high predictive ability compared to their rather limited etiologic importance in the initiation of decay.

TI  == the effect of ph on the sensitivity of species of lactobacillus to chlorhexidine  and the antibiotics minocycline and spiramycin.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity of a range of lactobacillus species to chlorhexidine, minocycline, and spiramycin, at a range of ph from 5.0 to 7.4. strains of streptococcus were also tested for their sensitivity to chlorhexidine, as a comparison between the genera. there were both inter- and intra-species variations in the sensitivity of these strains to chlorhexidine. the strains tested were sensitive at ph 6.7 to the following levels of chlorhexidine (micrograms/ml): l. casei (6 strains), 10-60; l. plantarum (4 strains), 40; l. fermentum (13 strains), 2-20; l. brevis (1 strain), 10; and l. acidophilus (3 strains), 10-60. the streptococcus species were sensitive to 1-4 micrograms/ml (13 strains); 4-10 micrograms/ml (3 strains); and  10-20 micrograms/ml (2 strains). one strain was able to survive 20 micrograms/ml. chlorhexidine was found to be less effective at lower ph levels. the following examples show sensitivity (micrograms/ml) at ph 6.5 followed by sensitivity at ph 5.0: l. casei (atcc 15008), 40,60; l. plantarum (ch 374), 40,100; l. fermentum (ch 324) 10,40; l. acidophilus (atcc 4356), 10,40; and s. mutans (bm 52), 2,2. all of the strains of lactobacillus tested with spiramycin were resistant at ph 5.0. minocycline was less affected by changes in ph, but at ph 7.4 lactobacillus  strains were more resistant to minocycline as compared with spiramycin. both of these antibiotics are bacteriostatic, and therefore may have a more limited effect than a bactericidal agent such as chlorhexidine. the lactobacillus strains tested required higher concentrations of chlorhexidine than did the strains of streptococcus for a killing effect in vitro.

TI  == folate analogues. 32. synthesis and biological evaluation of 2-desamino-2-methyl-n10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid and related compounds.
AB  == the chemical synthesis of three close analogues (2-4) of n10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolate (pddf) is described. the quinazoline ring of 2 and 4 was constructed from the pivotal intermediate 9 in a novel and unambiguous  manner during the final step of the synthesis under very mild conditions. 2-desamino-2-methyl-n10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolate (dmpddf) (2) was a strong inhibitor of human and lactobacillus casei thymidylate synthases, whereas 2-desamino-2-(trifluoromethyl)-n10-propargyl-5,8-didezafolate (3) and 2-desamino-2,3-dimethyl-n10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolate (4) were only weak inhibitors of this enzyme. dmpddf exhibited excellent growth inhibition of manca  human lymphoid leukemia and h35 hepatoma cells in culture. the inhibitor activities of 2 were 43- and 65-fold greater than that of pddf, respectively, in  these cell lines. h35r cells that are resistant to methotrexate by virtue of a transport defect were cross resistant to dmpddf but not to pddf. h35ff cells which have 70-fold greater amounts of thymidylate synthase compared to h35n cells were 130-fold resistant to dmpddf. furthermore, the toxicity of dmpddf to h35 hepatoma cells could be completely reversed by thymidine, establishing its locus  of action as thymidylate synthase. transport studies in vitro established that dmpddf effectively inhibits mtx influx into h35 hepatoma cells, whereas pddf has  no effect on mtx transport in this cell line. these data suggest that the greater activity of dmpddf relative to pddf is partly due to the ability of the former compound to enter cells via the mtx/reduced folate transport system. enzyme inhibition data of 4 suggest that the presence of n3h in dmpddf is essential for  binding to thymidylate synthase.

TI  == competition between streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus casei in mixed continuous culture.
AB  == in natural oral ecosystems, succession of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus  species occurs in bacterial communities which can be associated with the development of carious lesions. the objective of this study was to explore the interaction between 2 strains of s. mutans (sf2452) and lactobacillus casei (rb1014) when grown together in continuous culture under conditions of varying environmental ph and in the presence of fluoride. when the strains, isolated from approximal carious lesions, were grown initially at a dilution rate of 0.1 h-1 under a glucose limitation at ph 7.0, a stable mixed community developed (days 5-10) with s. mutans as the dominant population. when the ph control was removed  (day 10), the binary culture lowered the ph to 5.1 causing a small reduction in the numbers of s. mutans and allowing l. casei to predominate. a more dramatic effect was seen when the environmental ph was rapidly lowered to 4.8 by the addition of acid. in this case, the s. mutans population was significantly reduced and the l. casei population rose to the level previously held by s. mutans. re-adjustment of the ph to 7.0 resulted in a re-establishment of the population ratios prior to the addition of acid. the possibility that s. mutans was capable of aciduric adaptation during a biologically-generated ph reduction was examined by mixing cultures of both organisms after each had been grown to steady state at ph 5.5 in separate chemostats.

TI  == folate analogues. 31. synthesis of the reduced derivatives of 11-deazahomofolic acid, 10-methyl-11-deazahomofolic acid, and their evaluation as inhibitors of glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase.
AB  == the boon-leigh procedure, involving condensation of a 6-chloro-5-nitropyrimidine  (22) with an alpha-amino ketone (20 or 21) followed by reduction of the nitro group, cyclization, and l-glutamylation, led to the formation of 11-deazahomofolate (29) and its 10-methyl derivative (30). the corresponding (6r,s)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro (4, 5) and 7,8-dihydro (31, 32) derivatives were prepared by catalytic hydrogenation. (6s)-11-deazatetrahydrohomofolate was prepared from 29 by enzymatic reduction. compounds 29 and 30 had little effect (ic50 greater than 2 x 10(-5) m) on lactobacillus casei glycinamide ribonucleotide (gar) formyltransferase but (6r,s)-11-deazatetrahydrohomofolate (4) is a potent inhibitor of this enzyme (ic50 = 5 x 10(-8) m). it is at least 100 times more inhibitory than 33, the 6s compound, indicating that the 6r component of the mixture having the unnatural configuration at c6 (34) is responsible for the potent inhibition. compound 4 is a much weaker inhibitor of murine (l1210) and human (molt-4) leukemia cell gar formyltransferases (ic50 greater than 1 x 10(-5) m). (6r,s)-11-deaza-10-methyltetrahydrohomofolate (5) (ic50 = 1.1 x 10(-5) is 200 times weaker than 4 against l. casei gar formyltransferase. however, 11-deaza-10-methyldihydrohomofolate (32) is more inhibitory (ic50 = 5.5 x 10(-7) m) than 5 or 30. none of the compounds showed inhibition of l. casei aminoimidazolecarboxamide ribonucleotide (aicar) formyltransferase, dihydrofolate reductase, or thymidylate synthase. the dihydro  derivatives 31 and 32 are 5% as active as dihydrofolate as substrates for l. casei dihydrofolate reductase. compound 4 showed moderate inhibition of the growth of l. casei, streptococcus faecium, molt-4 cells, and mcf-7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells.

TI  == atypical transient state kinetics of recombinant human dihydrofolate reductase produced by hysteretic behavior. comparison with dihydrofolate reductases from other sources.
AB  == the transient state kinetics of catalysis for dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) from several enzyme sources including highly purified recombinant human enzyme (rhdhfr) have been examined. like dhfr from escherichia coli, the enzyme from lactobacillus casei, and isoenzyme 2 from streptococcus faecium exhibit a slow increase in activity upon addition of substrates to enzyme. no slow hysteresis of this type was detected with recombinant human dhfr (rhdhfr) or dhfr from chicken  or bovine liver or l1210 mouse leukemia cells (mdhfr). in contrast, both rhdhfr and mdhfr exhibited a very rapid decrease in activity (t1/2 = 30 and 20 ms, respectively) during a phase that occurred after the first turnover of the enzyme but before establishment of the steady state. this intermediate phase was not observed for the bacterial enzymes or the avian enzyme, nor was it observed with  a mutant of rhdhfr in which phe-31 has been replaced by leucine. for rhdhfr the intermediate phase is not a consequence of product inhibition, substrate depletion, or enzyme instability. it may therefore be concluded that this unusual transient state kinetic behavior results from the existence of two conformers of  the enzyme, one of which has a higher turnover number than the other with the equilibrium shifting in favor of the less active conformer during the course of catalysis. the equilibrium is particularly favorable for the less active conformer when nadp is present in the active site of rhdhfr, whereas bound tetrahydrofolate favors the more active conformer. the more active conformer has  a 6-fold higher km for dihydrofolate than does the less active conformer. the existence of these conformers is likely to produce cooperative behavior by rhdhfr in vivo.

TI  == the microbial ecology of soybean soaking for tempe production.
AB  == soybeans soaked in tap water for 24 to 36 h at 20, 30 or 37 degrees c underwent a natural fermentation that was characterized by the growth of microorganisms to 10(8)-10(10) cfu/ml (depending on temperature) and a reduction of ph from 6.5 to  4.5. lactobacillus casei, streptococcus faecium, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus dysgalactiae dominated the fermentation but, significant contributions were also made by klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella ozaenae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter agglomerans, citrobacter diversus and bacillus brevis, and the yeasts pichia burtonii, candida didensiae and rhodotorula rubra.  fermentation of surface-decontaminated beans in sterile water with pure cultures  of these isolates showed l. casei, strep. faecium and staph. epidermidis to be the main species responsible for the ph reduction. soybeans were the main source  of microorganisms for the fermentation. boiled beans did not undergo an acid fermentation.

TI  == arginolytic and ureolytic activities of pure cultures of human oral bacteria and  their effects on the ph response of salivary sediment and dental plaque in vitro.
AB  == thirty-nine different microorganisms commonly found in supragingival plaque and salivary sediment were screened for their ability to raise the ph by producing base from arginine, lysylarginine and urea. only actinomyces naeslundii and staphylococcus epidermidis showed significant ph-rise activity with all three compounds. eleven bacteria demonstrated such activity with arginine and lysylarginine but not with urea. only one, actinomyces viscosus, produced a ph-rise with urea but not with the two arginine compounds. the remaining 26 bacteria showed little or no base-forming activity with any of the three test substrates. the ability of the different oral bacteria to produce base (especially from urea) was a less universal function than their ability to produce acid from fermentable carbohydrate. substituting pure cultures of arginolytic or non-arginolytic bacteria for portions of the mixed bacterial populations of plaque or sediment in test incubations containing glucose and arginine altered their ability to produce ph-fall-ph-rise responses shaped like those of the stephen curve in vivo. in general, addition of arginolytic bacteria  made these in vitro ph responses less acidic, whereas addition of non-arginolytic bacteria made the responses more acidic. because of the relatively high arginolytic activity of the plaque harvested in this study, the effect of adding  non-arginolytic bacteria was more readily seen than the converse. similar changes in levels of ureolytic microorganisms and incubation with glucose and urea had little effect on sediment or plaque being able to produce a ph-fall-ph-rise type  of response. when increasing proportions of the mixed bacteria in salivary sediment were replaced with the highly cariogenic lactobacillus casei or streptococcus mutans, the ph minimum became slightly more acidic and then slightly more alkaline, whereas the ph-rise became progressively and significantly less. thus arginolytic bacteria have a different and greater effect on shaping the ph response of plaque or sediment than ureolytic bacteria. a large change in the proportions of arginolytic or non-arginolytic microorganisms may be needed to make a plaque microflora potentially non-cariogenic or cariogenic, respectively.

TI  == cariological assessment of leucrose [d-glucopyranosyl-alpha(1----5)-d-fructopyranose] as a sugar substitute.
AB  == leucrose [d-glucosyl-alpha(1----5)-d-fructopyranose] prepared by microbial-enzymatic transglycosidation from sucrose, is the first alpha(1----5)-linked disaccharide which possesses excellent nutritional properties with regard to metabolic utilization and is well tolerated. the aim of the present work was to assess its cariogenic potential. yeast invertase was shown to be inhibited by leucrose in a noncompetitive way, while hydrogenated leucrose (leucritol) acted as an activator. plaque polysaccharide forming glucosyltransferases from streptococcus cricetus aht were not influenced by leucrose, but by leucritol. essentially no acid formation was observed after incubation of leucrose with suspensions of human dental plaque, s. mutans nctc 10449, lactobacillus casei lsb 132 and actinomyces viscosus ny 1 no. 30. leucrose was a competitive inhibitor of the acid formation from sucrose by s. mutans nctc  10449 at neutral ph. furthermore, leucrose inhibited at neutral ph considerably the uptake of sucrose by s. mutans nctc 10449. the uptake of fructose and maltose was also inhibited but that of glucose not at all. in cara rats as the animal model, leucrose was compared to sucrose and to corn starch for its cariogenic potential. in sharp contrast to the group fed with 30% sucrose, caries scores of  the 30% leucrose group were not significantly different from the starch group. ph telemetry with an indwelling electrode in man proved lueucrose to be 'safe for teeth' since plaque ph did not drop below ph 5.7. leucrose is a novel noncariogenic disaccharide and thus represents a highly promising sugar substitute for caries prevention.

AB  == the effect of the oral and subcutaneous administration of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus on humoral antibody production and delayed type hypersensitivity response against sheep red blood cells (srbc) was studied. the species of the genus lactobacillus proved to be more effective in both cases, effects being stronger when working with viable bacteria than with non-viable cells. the stimulation of primary cellular and humoral immune responses reached optimal activity with a dose of 6 x 10(9) cells. the plaque-forming cells (pfc) and the circulating antibody titers to the srbc antigen obtained in the groups treated with lactobacilli were 2 to 3 times higher than those of the non-treated control  group. in mice fed with the different lactic acid bacteria circulating antibody against these microorganisms failed to be detected, but when they were administered by subcutaneous route a strong response to antilactic acid bacteria  was stimulated. s. thermophilus was not effective in increasing the immune response. these results suggest that the lactobacilli by oral route, exert a strong adjuvant activity which is responsible for the enhanced host immune responses obtained. in this respect, lactobacilli could be considered as the most promising oral adjuvant.

AB  == streptococcal plasmid pam beta 1 was conjugally transferred from streptococcus lactis kb953 (a transformant of pam beta 1) into lactobacillus casei 239. a unique transconjugant, l. casei c2, was found to contain a small (11.1 kilobase pair) plasmid, ply201, which was derived by a deletion event from pam beta 1. restriction analysis revealed that ply201 was missing approximately 58% of the original pam beta 1 genome, and contained 5 single restriction sites for avai, ecori, pvuii, hpai and kpni. physical analyses revealed that the stability and copy number of ply201 were elevated compared with those of pam beta 1 in l. casei. in addition, ply201 was no longer transferable by conjugation.

TI  == in vivo gene transfer systems and transposons.
AB  == the continued development of our understanding and application of the in vivo gene transfer systems, transduction and conjugation, and the more recent use of transposons in lactic acid bacteria is reviewed. the discovery of transduction and its use as a tool for genetic analysis is described. the history of the use of conjugation in lactic acid bacteria is outlined, but more detailed discussion  is reserved for in-depth analysis of the conjugation system associated with the lactose plasmids of streptococcus lactis strains ml3 and c2. this system is notable for an unusual cell aggregation phenotype associated with variants of lactose plasmids capable of high frequency transfer and the complex dna interactions associated with this property. recent advances in the use of wide host range conjugation systems, such as that of plasmid pam beta 1 are described, including the mobilisation of vectors by cointegrate formation and subsequent segregation after transfer. the successful exploitation of conjugation for the construction of bacteriophage-resistant starter cultures is highlighted. a description of transposable genetic elements in the lactic acid bacteria, both insertion sequences and transposons, puts emphasis on the elegant analysis of insertion sequence isl1 in lactobacillus casei and on the exploitation of the conjugative transposons tn916 and tn919. the latter is especially important for providing a technology to initiate analysis of the bacterial chromosome of the lactic acid bacteria.

AB  == urinary tract infections remain a common problem, particularly in the female population. new methods are required to manage recurrent cystitis, and extensive  research to date has suggested that restoration of the lactobacilli flora of the  urogenital tract may prevent these infections. in this study, five females suffering from recurrent urinary tract infections were treated twice weekly with  intravaginal and perineal implantation of lactobacillus casei gr-1. these organisms colonized the epithelium and prevented the emergence of coliform bacteria in most instances, but did not appear to affect enterococcal colonization. in vitro studies showed that l. casei gr-1 inhibited the growth of  the coliforms but did not inhibit enterococci. each of the five patients had infection-free periods ranging from 4 weeks to 6 months. the treatment was well tolerated, had no side effects, led to an improved well-being, and was preferred  to antibiotic treatment by all of the patients. these human studies, albeit of a  limited nature, are the first to examine the potential for lactobacillus therapy  in the prevention of urinary tract infections. the results show that lactobacilli therapy, using carefully selected organisms to treat patients who are closely followed, may be effective in the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections.

TI  == thermodynamic characterization of the interactions of methotrexate with dihydrofolate reductase by quantitative affinity chromatography.
AB  == affinity chromatography on methotrexate-sepharose has been used to evaluate dissociation constants for interactions of methotrexate with dihydrofolate reductase from lactobacillus casei. equilibrium constants of 0.25 microm and 0.6  nm were obtained for dissociation of the inhibitor from the enzyme-methotrexate and enzyme-nadph-methotrexate complexes, respectively, these estimates being in good agreement with the corresponding published values for dihydrofolate reductase from streptococcus faecium. by employing a different method for evaluating the thermodynamic dissociation constant for the enzyme-nadph-methotrexate interaction, this investigation provides independent support for the inference drawn from published fluorescence quenching studies that the interaction of methotrexate with dihydrofolate reductase-nadph complex is governed by a dissociation constant in the vicinity of 600 pm, a value slightly higher than, but approaching, the inhibition constant of 50-60 pm obtained by enzyme kinetic techniques.

AB  == the pharmacokinetics of leucovorin was evaluated after intravenous, intramuscular, and oral administration in a randomized crossover study of 37 healthy men. a single 25-mg dose of leucovorin calcium was administered intravenously, intramuscularly, or orally to the subjects. blood samples were obtained immediately before and at 13 time points up to 24 hours after the leucovorin dose. the three treatment phases were separated by one-week intervals. bioavailability was assessed by measuring over 24 hours the blood concentrations  of total folates, the parent compound 5-formyltetrahydrofolate, and the metabolite 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, using differential microbiologic assays with lactobacillus casei and streptococcus faecalis. both intravenous and intramuscular administration produced rapid increases in serum concentrations of  biologically active folates; these rises were sustained over time and were still  detectable at 24 hours after drug administration. the bioavailability of intravenous and intramuscular doses was comparable based on area under the serum  concentration-time curve, although for intramuscular administration, the peak concentration was lower and the time to peak concentration was longer. the initial rise in serum folate with intravenous and intramuscular dosing represented 5-formyltetrahydrofolate; this fell concomitantly with the appearance of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. oral leucovorin was 92% bioavailable compared with intravenous administration and produced a predictably different pattern of circulating folates, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate being the predominant form. terminal elimination half-life, apparent volume of distribution, and clearance of total folate were not significantly different among the three treatments.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the net surface charge density, as revealed by electrophoretic mobility values, of fourteen strains of lactobacilli and two strains of enterococci isolated from  the small intestine of pigs, was studied by a free zone electrophoretic technique in a rotating quartz electrophoresis tube. most lactobacilli strains of low surface hydrophobicity (i.e. hydrophilic strains) showed high electrophoretic mobility values but no visible capsule, while most strains of intermediate and high surface hydrophobicity showed low mobility. some strains, hydrophobic as well as hydrophilic, had mobility values equal or close to zero. electrophoretic  mobilities of strains of extremely high surface hydrophobicity were difficult to  determine due to cell clumping during electrophoresis. these strains adhered best in vitro to isolated pig intestinal epithelial cells. both enterococcal strains from pig showed high electrophoretic mobility values. in conclusion, a rapid, accurate and highly reproducible method is described for the determination of the net surface charge density of procaryotes. high electrophoretic mobility of hydrophilic strains suggests surface accumulation of highly negative charged surface polymers such as capsule or slime material. however, none of the porcine  strains showed visible capsule, as did the hydrophilic laboratory strain lactobacillus casei nctc 10302. electrophoretic methods have a great potential in studies of adhesion mechanisms of bacteria to different surfaces as well as isolation of capsule variants within a heterogenous bacterial population.

TI  == nucleotide sequence of the beta-d-phosphogalactoside galactohydrolase gene of lactobacillus casei: comparison to analogous pbg genes of other gram-positive organisms.
AB  == lactose metabolism in lactobacillus casei occurs via phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase uptake of lactose and subsequent cleavage of lactose-6-phosphate by beta-d-phosphogalactoside galactohydrolase (p-beta gal). the genes for lactose uptake and p-beta gal have been shown to be plasmid-associated in l. casei 64h [chassy et al., curr. microbiol. 1 (1978) 141-144]. the cloned p-beta gal-coding gene (pbg) previously described [lee et al., j. bacteriol. 152 (1982) 1138-1146] was subcloned on a 2.9-kb kpni-bg/ii fragment isolated from plz605. sequence analysis of this fragment revealed an open reading frame of 1422 bp capable of coding for a protein product containing  474 amino acids and having an mr of 53,989. the l. casei protein showed a high degree of homology to the proteins whose sequence was deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the pbg genes of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus lactis. because of the significant homologies observed, as reflected in amino acid content as well as predicted structural characteristics of the three proteins, we suggest a common origin for the p-beta gals of these three organisms.

AB  == the syntheses of 8-deazahomofolic acid and its tetrahydro derivative, potential inhibitors of thymidylate synthase (ts) and other folate related enzymes, are described. wittig condensation of 2-acetamido-6-formyl-4-pyrimidinol with the triphenylphosphine ylide 3 derived from n-acetyl-4-(p-carbethoxyanilino)-1-chloro-2-butanone, hydrogenation of the enone  intermediate 5, introduction of a 5-amino group via diazonium coupling, and reductive ring closure yielded ethyl n11-acetyl-8-deazahomopteroate (8). alkaline hydrolysis gave 8-deazahomopteroic acid, which was blocked as the 11-trifluoroacetyl derivative, coupled with diethyl l-glutamate, and the blocking groups saponified to afford 8-deazahomofolic acid (12). hydrogenation of the glutamate diester intermediate and subsequent saponification yielded the tetrahydro-8-deazahomofolate (14). growth inhibition of streptococcus faecium, lactobacillus casei, and l1210 cells in culture by the target compounds was modest. they were also weak inhibitors of thymidylate synthase, dihydrofolate reductase, glycinamide-ribonucleotide transformylase, and aminoimidazolecarboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase. in contrast, 8-deazafolate showed moderate inhibition of aminoimidazolecarboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase, suggesting that inhibition of this enzyme may be related to its cytotoxic action. tetrahydro-8-deazahomofolate showed low substrate activity with thymidylate synthase.

TI  == synthesis and biological evaluation of poly-gamma-glutamyl metabolites of 10-deazaaminopterin and 10-ethyl-10-deazaaminopterin.
AB  == the chemical synthesis of a series of poly-gamma-glutamyl metabolites of the experimental anticancer drugs 10-deazaaminopterin (10-daam) and 10-ethyl-10-deazaaminopterin (10-edaam) has been carried out by the solid-phase procedure. the synthetic products were identical with the poly-gamma-glutamyl metabolites of radiolabeled 10-daam and 10-edaam produced by normal mouse tissues with regard to elution volume from [(diethylamino)ethyl]cellulose columns and susceptibility to hydrolysis by human plasma folylpolyglutamate hydrolase. poly-gamma-glutamyl metabolites with a glutamate chain length of up to four glutamate residues were detected in the tissues. the antifolate activity was evaluated with methotrexate (mtx) sensitive and mtx-resistant strains of lactobacillus casei and streptococcus faecium. in general, inhibitory potency decreases with increasing glu chain length. however there are two exceptions. addition of one glu residue to 10-daam enhances its potency for mtx-resistant l.  casei and addition of one glu residue to 10-edaam enhances its potency for the mtx-sensitive l. casei. as shown earlier for mtx polyglutamates, polyglutamylation greatly enhances the inhibitory potency of 10-daam and 10-edaam for l. casei thymidylate synthase. mtx polyglutamates are 15-30 times more inhibitory than the corresponding 10-daam derivatives and 30-60 times more inhibitory than the corresponding 10-edaam derivatives. polyglutamylation of 10-daam had little influence on its ability to inhibit l. casei dihydrofolate reductase; however, with 10-edaam, addition of one or two glu residues enhanced its inhibitory potency 2.3-fold.

TI  == fluoride inhibition of proton-translocating atpases of oral bacteria.
AB  == the atpases of isolated membranes of lactic acid bacteria were found to be inhibited by fluoride in a complex manner. among the enzymes tested, that of streptococcus mutans gs-5 was the most sensitive to fluoride, and the initial rate of hydrolysis of atp was reduced 50% by approximately 3 mm fluoride. the enzyme of lactobacillus casei atcc 4646 was the most resistant, and about 25 mm fluoride was required for 50% inhibition. the response to fluoride appeared to involve reversible, noncompetitive inhibition during short exposure to low levels of fluoride and nonreversible inhibition at higher fluoride levels. in addition,  kinetic studies of the effects of fluoride on the enzymes of membranes of s. mutans and l. casei indicated that reversible inhibition was at least partly overcome at high levels of either atp or mg. the effects of ph on fluoride inhibition of atpases were markedly different from the effects of ph on inhibition of acid/base regulation of intact cells by fluoride. it appeared that  formation of hf was not required for inhibition of the atpases. f1 atpases isolated from the membranes by washing with buffers of low ionic strength proved  to be less sensitive to fluoride than the membrane-associated f1f0 holoenzymes, and it was concluded that the f0 or membrane sector of the holoenzyme is involved in fluoride inhibition.

TI  == factors affecting the rate of breakdown of bacterial protein in rumen fluid.
AB  == 1. the cellular proteins of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, lactobacillus casei, megasphaera elsdenii, selenomonas ruminantium and streptococcus bovis were labelled by growth in the presence of l-[14c]leucine, and the breakdown of labelled protein was measured in incubations of these bacteria with rumen fluid to which unlabelled 5 mm-l-leucine was added. the rate of protein breakdown was estimated from the rate of release of radioactivity into acid-soluble material. 2. protein breakdown occurred at different rates in different species. the mean rates for b. fibrisolvens, l. casei, m. elsdenii, sel. ruminantium and str. bovis were 28.6, 18.1, 17.7, 10.5 and 5.3%/h respectively in samples of strained rumen  fluid (srf) with different protozoal populations. rates of 3%/h or less were found in srf from ciliate-free sheep or in faunated srf from which protozoa had been removed by centrifugation. further removal of mixed rumen bacteria had little effect. suspensions of washed protozoa degraded bacterial protein at rates which were of the same order as those found in srf. 3. the rate of breakdown of bacterial protein in different samples of srf tended to increase as the numbers of small entodiniomorphid protozoa increased. the numbers of larger entodiniomorphs and holotrichs had no obvious influence on this rate. 4. autoclaved and u.v.-treated bacteria were generally no different from live bacteria in their susceptibility to breakdown in srf from faunated sheep, indicating that endogenous protein turnover was not a significant cause of bacterial protein catabolism. 5. the rate of bacterial protein breakdown was unrelated to the proteolytic activity of srf. 6. it was concluded that predation  by small protozoa is by far the most important cause of bacterial protein turnover in the rumen, with autolysis, other lytic factors and endogenous proteolysis being of minor importance.

TI  == a mixed-culture chemostat system to predict the effect of anti-microbial agents on the oral flora: preliminary studies using chlorhexidine.
AB  == a mixed-culture chemostat system, composed of nine bacterial species representative of plaque in health and disease, has been assessed as an improved  laboratory method of evaluating the likely in vivo effects of antimicrobial agents used in dentistry. the advantages of the system include reproducibility, the long-term stable cultivation of bacteria under controllable conditions, and repeated sampling, for bacteriological and biochemical studies, without disrupting the stability of the community. the effects of (i) the continuous provision of chlorhexidine (chx) and (ii) three pulses of chx (final concentration in both experiments = 0.24 mmol/l) on the composition of the chemostat communities were monitored. only l. casei survived the continuous provision of chx; the other bacteria were killed and were lost at different rates which generally corresponded to their known sensitivities to chx. after each chx  pulse, the numbers of bacteria fell markedly. again, l. casei was least affected, while a. viscosus, b. intermedius, and f. nucleatum were temporarily undetectable but returned to their original levels within 2-4 generation times. counts of s. mutans were affected more by chx than those of s. sanguis or s. mitior. the effect of successive pulses of chx on the viability of some bacteria and on acid  production (as measured by ph-fall experiments) decreased, suggesting that adaptation to chx had occurred. the fact that the in vitro observations paralleled previous clinical findings suggests that the mixed-culture system could be used as a predictive model of the probable effect on the oral flora of new anti-microbial agents prior to expensive trials in animals or human volunteers.

TI  == nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of lipoteichoic acid.
AB  == lipoteichoic acid acids with a range of chemical compositions have been studied using 1h; 13c- and 31p-nuclear magnetic resonance. proton spectroscopy provided a rapid method for demonstrating whether alanine in a sample is covalently bound to the polyglycerophosphate chains and for monitoring hydrolysis of alanine. the nature of sugar substituents can be determined, with some limitations, from the 13c spectra, and the proportions of glycerol residues substituted by alanine and  sugar can be measured. the 31p spectra of lipoteichoic acid provided information  about both the degree of substitution and the distribution of the substituent along the polyglycerophosphate chain, except when the substituent was galactose.  the polyglycerophosphate chains were shown to undergo rapid internal rotation and no evidence for tertiary structure was found either in the presence or absence of magnesium ions. magnesium ions exchange rapidly between the bound and free state  and the binding constant to lipoteichoic acid of 64 m-1 is typical for monophosphates in aqueous solution. there was no evidence that alanine substitution affects the binding constant for magnesium ions.

TI  == antimicrobial action of new, proprietary lining cements.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of innovative, commercial lining cements was investigated. a liner which contains calcium hydroxide and is polymerized by visible light (prisma vlc dycal) and a glass-ionomer lining cement (gc lining cement) were compared with two more established lining cements (advanced formula  ii dycal and life). antibacterial activity and hemolysis-like agar change at 24,  48, and 72 hours were measured on blood agar plates inoculated with streptococcus mutans kpsk 2 (serotype c), lactobacillus casei ssp rhamnosus atcc 11981, and chewing-stimulated saliva. prisma vlc dycal did not affect bacteria or agar. the  glass-ionomer lining cement, with an acidic ph at setting, had the most pronounced effect on all test organisms and on the agar. even after 48 hours' setting, it inhibited growth of s. mutans. the control lining cement (afii dycal) showed antibacterial activity toward both specific micro-organisms as well as some activity against the salivary organisms. the material life showed only partial inhibition of microbial growth. for all lining cements, the hemolytic-like agar change correlated with antibacterial effects. the surface ph  of the freshly-set cements containing calcium hydroxide was alkaline. it would seem that a simple correlation between high surface ph and antibacterial activity among these cements does not exist. also, further biological characterization of  new lining cements is required to direct their appropriate clinical use.

TI  == lysozyme-protease-inorganic monovalent anion lysis of oral bacterial strains in buffers and stimulated whole saliva.
AB  == similar to streptococcus mutans, buffer suspensions of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, and fusobacterium nucleatum all undergo cell lysis when  treated with the lysozyme-protease-inorganic monovalent anion antibacterial system. for lactobacillus species treated with lysozyme and proteases at phs of 4 and 5.3, lysis resulted when a lytic activating concentration of bicarbonate anion followed enzyme treatment. furthermore, synergistic lysis of these bacteria was noted when lysozyme-protease treatment was followed by bicarbonate anion used in combination with chloride or fluoride anions. noteworthy, the halides were not active in promoting lysis when used by themselves in the absence of bicarbonate.  for f. nucleatum suspended at ph 6.9, lysis was dependent upon the ionic strength of the buffer and resulted when lysozyme-protease treatment of the organism was followed by 100 mmol/l bicarbonate activation. when lysozyme and proteases were omitted from the incubation mixtures and replaced by stimulated whole saliva, ph  5.3, lysis was observed only with l. plantarum and s. mutans, but not with l. casei. the latter could be lysed, however, if suspended in saliva which was diluted several-fold with distilled water. in experiments where lysozyme was selectively depleted from whole saliva by immunoadsorption affinity chromatography, the great majority of the lysis capability of the saliva for l. plantarum was lost, although a significant degree of lysis appeared to be due to  salivary factors other than lysozyme. f. nucleatum was also found to lyse in saliva at neutral ph, suggesting that both gram-positive and gram-negative oral bacteria may be susceptible to this antibacterial system in vivo.

TI  == absorption kinetics of orally administered leucovorin calcium.
AB  == oral dose proportionality and pharmacokinetics of leucovorin [(d,l)-5-formyltetrahydrofolate (5-formyl-thf)] were studied in 30 healthy male subjects. in a randomized cross-over design, 24 fasted subjects were given 4 of a series of 5 single test doses between 20 and 100 mg, at 1-week intervals, of 5-formyl-thf as an oral solution of leucovorin calcium. six separate subjects received 200 mg iv and po in a 2-way crossover. blood and urine samples were collected over 24 hours for differential microbiological folate assays using lactobacillus casei and streptococcus faecalis. using l casei activity to measure total serum folates, the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to infinite time (auc[0-infinity]) was calculated. relative bioavailabilities were 78%, 62%, 49%, and 42% for the 40-, 60-, 80-, and 100-mg doses, respectively. both the auc and peak concentration (cpeak) of total folates (consisting predominantly of the major metabolite, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-methyl-thf], displayed significant deviation from linearity consistent with a saturation of folate absorption. absolute bioavailability of the 200-mg oral dose of leucovorin based on auc was 31% compared with that of the iv dose (6,848 vs. 22,298 ng.hr/ml, respectively). total clearance, terminal half-life, and apparent volume of distribution of total folate at the 200-mg dose were not significantly different between the two routes of administration. eighty-three percent of the biologically active iv dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours, 31% as 5-methyl-thf. twenty percent of the same oral dose was excreted in 24 hours, 16%  as 5-methyl-thf. in contrast to the nondose-proportionality observed in total serum folates, auc of the small component of s faecalis activity, which appeared  earlier than 5-methyl-thf, displayed linear kinetics, suggestive of a distinct mechanism of uptake. as dose increased, s faecalis activity increased in relative proportion to l casei, indicating that saturation of the enzymatic bioconversion  to 5-methyl-thf may also be occurring. in light of the demonstrated nondose-proportionality of total folates with oral leucovorin in this dose range, consideration should be given to parenteral administration in regimens employing  higher doses. oral administration should be at a level consistent with the capacity for efficient folate uptake.

AB  == the poly-gamma-glutamyl derivatives of n10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid (pddf) with a chain length of up to five glutamate residues were synthesized from n10-propargyl-5,8-dideazapteroic acid by the solid-phase procedure. these compounds were evaluated for their antifolate activity using folate-requiring microorganisms and intact and permeabilized l1210 cells and as inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthase derived from l. casei. the polyglutamylated derivatives of pddf (1) were more active than the parent compound in inhibiting the growth of l. casei, thymidylate synthesis in permeabilized l1210 cells, and l. casei thymidylate synthase. two analogues of 5,8-dideazafolic acid (2 and 3), one with a 2-butyne and another with a cyclopropylmethyl substituent at n10, were also synthesized and evaluated for their antifolate activities using the above-mentioned test systems. they were considerably less active than pddf or its polyglutamylated derivatives. n10-propargyl-5,8-dideazapteroyl tri-, tetra-, and pentaglutamates were equipotent with 5-fluorodeoxyuridylate as inhibitors of thymidylate synthesis in  permeabilized l1210 cells. the polyglutamyl metabolites of pddf were shown to be  the most potent antifolate inhibitors of l. casei and l1210 thymidylate synthases yet described.

TI  == acid tolerance, proton permeabilities, and membrane atpases of oral streptococci.
AB  == differences in acid tolerance among representative oral streptococci were found to be related more closely to the dynamic permeabilities of the bacteria to protons than to differences in the sensitivities of cell membranes to gross damage caused by environmental acidification. for streptococcus mutans gs-5, streptococcus sanguis nctc 10904, and streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419, gross  membrane damage, indicated by the release of magnesium from whole cells, occurred at ph values below about 4 and was rapid and extensive at ph values of about 3 or less. a more aciduric, lactic acid bacterium, lactobacillus casei atcc 4646, was  more resistant to environmental acidification, and gross membrane damage was evident only at ph values below 3. assessments of the movements of protons into s. mutans cells after an acid pulse at various ph values indicated that permeability to protons was minimal at a ph value of about 5, at which the average half time for ph equilibration across the cell membrane was about 12 min. the corresponding values for the less aciduric organism s. sanguis were ph 7 and  8.2 min, and the values for the intermediate organism s. salivarius were ph 6 and 6.6 min. the atpase inhibitor dicyclohexylcarbodiimide acted to increase markedly the permeability of each organism to protons, and this action indicated that permeability involved not only the passive inflow of protons but also active outflow through the proton-translocating membrane atpase. membranes were isolated from each of the bacteria, and ph profiles for atpase activities indicated ph optima of about 7.5, 7.0, 6.0, and 5.0 for s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. mutans,  and l. casei, respectively. thus, the ph profiles for the enzymes reflected the acid tolerances of the bacteria and the permeabilities of whole cells to protons.

AB  == evidence indicating that modifications at the 5- and 10-positions of classical folic acid antimetabolites lead to compounds with favorable differential membrane transport in tumor vs. normal proliferative tissue prompted an investigation of 5-alkyl-5-deaza analogues. 2-amino-4-methyl-3,5-pyridinedicarbonitrile, prepared  by hydrogenolysis of its known 6-chloro precursor, was treated with guanidine to  give 2,4-diamino-5-methylpyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carbonitrile which was converted via the corresponding aldehyde and hydroxymethyl compound to 6-(bromomethyl)-2,4-diamino-5-methylpyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine. reductive condensation of the nitrile 8 with diethyl n-(4-amino-benzoyl)-l-glutamate followed by ester hydrolysis gave 5-methyl-5-deazaaminopterin. treatment of 12 with formaldehyde and na(cn)bh3 afforded 5-methyl-5-deazamethotrexate, which was  also prepared from 15 and dimethyl n-[(4-methylamino)benzoyl]-l-glutamate followed by ester hydrolysis. 5-methyl-10-ethyl-5-deazaaminopterin was similarly  prepared from 15. biological evaluation of the 5-methyl-5-deaza analogues together with previously reported 5-deazaaminopterin and 5-deazamethotrexate for  inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) isolated from l1210 cells and for their effect on cell growth inhibition, transport characteristics, and net accumulation of polyglutamate forms in l1210 cells revealed the analogues to have essentially the same properties as the appropriate parent compound, aminopterin or methotrexate (mtx), except that 20 and 21 were approximately 10 times more growth inhibitory than mtx. in in vivo tests against p388/0 and p388/mtx leukemia in mice, the analogues showed activity comparable to that of mtx, with the more potent 20 producing the same response in the p388/0 test as mtx but at one-fourth the dose; none showed activity against p388/mtx. hydrolytic deamination of 12 and 20 produced 5-methyl-5-deazafolic acid and 5,10-dimethyl-5-deazafolic acid, respectively. in bacterial studies on the 2-amino-4-oxo analogues, 5-deazafolic acid proved to be a potent inhibitor of lactobacillus casei dhfr and also the growth of both l. casei atcc 7469 and streptococcus faecium atcc 8043. its 5-methyl congener 22 is also inhibitory toward l. casei, but its ic50 for growth  inhibition is much lower than its ic50 values for inhibition of dhfr or thymidylate synthase from l. casei, suggesting an alternate site of action.

AB  == nine oral bacteria, associated with both healthy and diseased sites in the mouth, were grown at d = 0.05 h-1 (mean generation time 13.9 h) in a glucose-limited chemostat. after an initial period of steady-state growth at ph 7.0, ph control was discontinued. the ph then decreased until it stabilized at ph 4.1 after 9 d (16 generations), while the eh rose from -165 mv to +160 mv. the lowering in ph resulted in the composition and metabolism of the flora being altered and in increased bacterial aggregation. at ph 7.0, 'streptococcus mitior', veillonella alcalescens and s. sanguis were most numerous while at ph 4.1 the counts of all bacteria fell except for lactobacillus casei, which became predominant. the proportions of s. mutans within the community also increased while s. sanguis was recovered only occasionally and bacteroides intermedius was not detected below ph 4.6. the survival at ph 4.1 of several other species would not have been predicted from earlier pure culture studies. relative to ph 7.0, the community growing at ph 4.1 produced more lactic acid, washed cells had a greater glycolytic activity over a wider ph range but amino acid metabolism decreased. in general, when ph control was restored, so were the original patterns of metabolism and bacterial counts, except for b. intermedius, which was still not detected. the inverse relationship between s. sanguis and s. mutans, and the increase in proportions of l. casei and s. mutans during growth in a low ph environment parallel observations made in vivo and suggest that the chemostat can be used as a model for microbial behaviour in dental plaque.

TI  == forms of human milk folacin and variation patterns.
AB  == the pattern of folacin in 180 human milk samples collected from 16 women was studied before and after pteroylglutamic hydroxylase (conjugase) treatment. the differential response of lactobacillus casei versus streptococcus faecalis distinguishes n-5-methyltetrahydrofolate from other forms. growth of pediococcus  cerevisiae differentiates the reduced monoglutamates, other than the n-5-methylated derivative, from oxidized folacins. mean folacin activity with l.  casei was 85.3 ng/ml. prior to conjugase treatment of samples, mean activity was  46.9 ng/ml with this organism. the responses of s. faecalis and p. cerevisiae were 48% and 7.6%, respectively, of the total l. casei active folacins. the total l. casei active folacins increased from 76.5 ng/ml at 6 weeks of lactation to 97.1 ng/ml at 12 weeks of lactation. increases were also observed with time of day: from morning (65.7 ng/ml), to afternoon (80.0 ng/ml), and to evening (114.7  ng/ml). hindmilk had greater total l. casei activity (100.0 ng/ml) than foremilk  (73.8 ng/ml). although folacins active for s. faecalis and p. cerevisiae were not affected by duration of lactation, increases in folacin activity with time of day and from fore- to hindmilk were observed using both of these organisms. values for the folacin content of human milk are therefore dependent on sampling procedures. pteroylpolyglutamates of greater than or equal to 3 glutamic acid residues and n-5-methyltetrahydrofolate are the predominant forms of human milk folacin based on differential growth responses of l. casei, s. faecalis, and p. cerevisiae to these forms.

TI  == abnormal folate metabolism in feed-related anemia of cultured channel catfish.
AB  == "no-blood disease" is a severe, feed-related anemia of channel catfish. pathological features in advanced cases include almost total absence of circulating red blood cells, hepatic fatty change, megaloblastic arrest of hematopoiesis, and intussusceptions of the small intestine. in view of similarities to folate deficiency in man studies were made regarding the intake and metabolism of folic acid. when a bacterial culture medium, containing inorganic salts and folic acid as the sole carbon source, was inoculated with a small sample of anemia-producing feed, over 95% of the folate was destroyed. a yellow precipitate formed and had the characteristic uv spectrum of pteroic acid; it represented 32% of the folate originally present. differential microbiological assays revealed that the same anemia-producing feed contained 20 times as much folate activity for streptococcus fecalis as for lactobacillus casei (59 micrograms/g vs 2.6 micrograms/g). this growth response is compatible with an excess of pteroic acid and/or formyl-pteroic acid which support the former but not the latter organism. plasma folate activity (mean +/- sd, ng/ml) assayed with l. casei and s. fecalis in 22 normal catfish (hematocrit range 32-43) was 17.2 +/- 6.2 and 23.4 +/- 13.8, respectively. comparable values in 15 anemic catfish (hematocrit range 0 to 30) were 35.5 +/- 33.7 and 58.7 +/- 76.5. the mean plasma  pteroate activity, estimated by subtraction, was 6.2 and 23.2 ng/ml, respectively, in normal and anemic fish. fingerling catfish raised under controlled conditions on feed containing 130 mg/kg of pteroic acid failed to gain weight and developed anemia with the characteristic red cell morphologic features that are seen in the naturally occurring disease. we conclude that severe anemia  in channel catfish can be caused by abnormal folate metabolism and may be due to  ingestion of folic acid-breakdown products, such as pteroic acid. it is postulated that microorganisms in contaminated feed synthesize folate which, in turn, is converted to pteroate by a pseudomonad or similar organism.

TI  == effect of monoclonal antibodies against lipoteichoic acid from the oral bacterium streptococcus mutans on its adhesion and plaque-accumulation in vitro.
AB  == five monoclonal antibodies directed against streptococcus mutans strain jbp lipoteichoic acid (lta) were characterized. they were all similarly reactive with the immunizing lta-containing extract, with intact strep. mutans jbp cells and with lta purified from lactobacillus casei. immobilized anti-lta antibodies removes lta from lta-containing extracts. the binding of antibodies to lta was inhibited by the aqueous extract but not by the organic extract of de-acylated lta, indicating reactivity with the polyglycerol-phosphate portion of the molecule. antibodies were reactive with all serotypes of strep. mutans, as well as with strains of streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis and l. casei,  but not with lta-negative species streptococcus mitis or actinomyces viscosus. anti-lta antibodies at doses of 0.3 or 3.0 micrograms/ml, had no effect on the adherence of strep. mutans jbp to experimental salivary pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite, but enhanced adherence 150-300 per cent at 30 micrograms/ml. there was no effect of anti-lta antibodies in a chemostat model which measured sucrose-dependent plaque accumulation by strep. mutans. the results argue against a major role for lta in strep. mutans adherence or plaque accumulation in vitro.

TI  == immunological study of lactate dehydrogenase from streptococcus mutans and evidence of common antigenic domains with lactate dehydrogenases from lactic bacteria.
AB  == rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against purified streptococcus mutans l-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase reacted with the purified enzyme, giving a marked deviation of its kinetic parameters. the enzyme affinity for pyruvate or nadh decreased in the presence of antibody, the affinity for fructose 1,6-diphosphate  (fdp) appeared to be slightly affected, and the cooperativity of the ligand binding was lowered. a partial protective effect was observed when the enzyme was preincubated with fdp prior to the antibody adjunction. an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay allowed detection of a 30% decrease in enzyme-antibody fixation when fdp was added. the protective effect observed with fdp could be correlated with a conformational change induced by the activator. a decrease of antibody binding in the presence of fdp was also obtained with s. sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, and lactobacillus casei lactate dehydrogenases, which reflects a similar mechanism of activation among lactic bacteria. nadh did not offer any protection against antibody inhibition or fixation, and the coenzyme affinity decrease could be attributed to an indirect mechanism. on the contrary,  pyruvate and the immunoglobulins apparently could compete for specific binding sites. a decrease of antibody binding was also obtained with three heterologous lactic bacterial lactate dehydrogenases, indicating a conservation of antigenic determinants implicated in the substrate binding.

TI  == phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase transport system of streptococcus mutans: purification of hpr and enzyme i and determination of their intracellular concentrations by rocket immunoelectrophoresis.
AB  == enzyme i and hpr, the general proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase system, play a pivotal role in the control of sugar utilization in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. to determine whether growth conditions could modify the rate of biosynthesis of these proteins in streptococcus mutans, we first purified to homogeneity enzyme i and hpr from s. mutans atcc 27352. using specific antibodies obtained against these proteins, we  determined by rocket electrophoresis the intracellular levels of enzyme i and hpr in cells of s. mutans 27352 grown under various batch culture conditions and in a number of glucose-grown cells of other strains of s. mutans. hpr was purified by  the procedure reported by gauthier et al. (l. gauthier, d. mayrand, and c. vadeboncoeur, j. bacteriol. 160:755-763, 1984) and displayed a single band with a molecular weight of 6,650 when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea gel electrophoresis. enzyme i was purified by deae-cellulose chromatography, affinity chromatography on an anti-streptococcus salivarius column, and preparative electrophoresis. the protein migrated as a single band in native and denaturating gel electrophoresis. the subunit molecular weight of enzyme i determined by electrophoresis under denaturating conditions was 68,000. in gel filtration chromatography at 4 degrees c, the enzyme migrated as a 135,000- to 160,000-molecular-weight species, suggesting that enzyme i is a dimer. in double  immunodiffusion experiments, antibodies against hpr reacted with several oral streptococci, streptococcus lactis, streptococcus faecium, and lactobacillus casei, but not with bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. antibodies against enzyme i of s. mutans 27352 cross-reacted with enzyme i  from all the other oral streptococci tested. no cross-reaction was observed with  other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the levels of enzyme i and hpr determined by rocket electrophoresis in s. mutans 27352 varied at the most by twofold, depending on the growth conditions. glucose-grown cells of other s. mutans strains contained levels of enzyme i and hpr which were similar to those found in s. mutans 27352.

TI  == the establishment of reproducible, complex communities of oral bacteria in the chemostat using defined inocula.
AB  == nine commonly isolated oral bacterial populations were inoculated into a glucose-limited and a glucose-excess (amino acid-limited) chemostat maintained at a constant ph 7.0 and a mean community generation time of 13.9 h. the bacterial populations were streptococcus mutans atcc 2-27351, strep. sanguis nctc 7865, strep. mitior ef 186, actinomyces viscosus wvu 627, lactobacillus casei ac 413, neisseria sp. a1078, veillonella alkalescens atcc 17745, bacteroides intermedius  t 588 and fusobacterium nucleatum nctc 10593. all nine populations became established in the glucose-limited chemostat although strep. sanguis and neisseria sp. were present only after a second and third inoculation, respectively. in contrast, even following repeated inoculations, strep. mutans, b. intermedius and neisseria sp. could not be maintained under glucose-excess conditions. a more extensive pattern of fermentation products and amino acid catabolism occurred under glucose-limited growth; this simultaneous utilization of mixed substrates also contributed to the higher yields (y molar glucose) and greater species diversity of these communities. microscopic and biochemical evidence suggested that cell-to-cell interactions and food chains were occurring  among community members. to compare the reproductibility of this system, communities were established on three occasions under glucose-limitation and twice under glucose-excess conditions. the bacterial composition of the steady-state communities and their metabolic behaviour were similar when grown under identical conditions but varied in a consistent manner according to the nutrient responsible for limiting growth. although a direct simulation of the oral cavity was not attempted, the results show that the chemostat could be used  as an environmentally-related model to grow complex but reproducible communities  of oral bacteria for long periods from a defined inoculum.

TI  == streptococcal phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system: purification  and characterization of a phosphoprotein phosphatase which hydrolyzes the phosphoryl bond in seryl-phosphorylated histidine-containing protein.
AB  == histidine-containing protein (hpr) of gram-positive bacteria was found to be phosphorylated at a seryl residue (p-ser-hpr) in an atp-dependent reaction catalyzed by a protein kinase (j. deutscher and m. h. saier, jr., proc. natl. acad. sci. u.s.a. 80:6790-6794, 1983). here we describe the purification and characterization of a soluble enzyme of streptococcus faecalis which splits the phosphoryl bond in p-ser-hpr. the enzyme has a molecular weight of ca. 7.5 x 10(4), as determined by its migration behavior on a sephacryl s-200 column. on native polyacrylamide gels the purified enzyme produced only one protein band. on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels we found one major protein band of molecular weight 2.9 x 10(4) and two minor protein bands of molecular weights 2.3 x 10(4) and 7 x 10(4). fructose 1,6-diphosphate, which stimulated the atp-dependent, protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of hpr, had no effect on  the phosphatase activity. other glycolytic intermediates also had no effect. however, inorganic phosphate, which inhibited the atp-dependent hpr kinase, stimulated the p-ser-hpr phosphatase. edta at a concentration of 0.1 mm completely inhibited the phosphatase. divalent cations like mg2+, mn2+, and co2+  overcame the inhibition by edta. fe2+, zn2+, and cu2+ had no effect, whereas ca2+ slightly inhibited the phosphatase. atp was also found to inhibit the phosphatase. under conditions in which atp severely inhibited the phosphatase, adp was found to have no effect on the enzyme activity. besides p-ser-hpr of s. faecalis, the phosphatase was also able to hydrolyze the phosphoryl bond in p-ser-hpr of streptococcus lactis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes, and lactobacillus casei. phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside phosphorylation, catalyzed by the s. aureus phosphoenolpyruvate:lactose phosphotransferase system, was about 150-fold  decreased in the presence of p-ser-hpr of s. aureus, as compared with hpr. however, when p-ser-hpr was first incubated with p-ser-hpr phosphatase to allow complete hydrolysis of the phosphoryl bond, it had the same activity as hpr. besides this cytoplasmic phosphoprotein phosphatase, we detected a membrane-bound phosphatase which also hydrolyzed the phosphoryl bond in p-ser-hpr.

TI  == binding of methotrexate to dihydrofolate reductase and its relation to protonation of the ligand.
AB  == stopped-flow spectrophotometry and stopped-flow fluorometry have been used to study the binding of methotrexate (mtx) and 3-deazamethotrexate (3-deazamtx) to dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) isoenzymes from streptococcus faecium and from lactobacillus casei. the absorbance change and fluorescence quenching that occur  when mtx binds to dhfr isoenzyme ii from s. faecium (sfdhfr ii) are both biphasic and give similar apparent rate constants for both phases. the faster phase has an apparent rate constant that is dependent on mtx concentration and therefore corresponds to the initial binding reaction. from the concentration dependence it has been calculated that the association rate constant is 3.0 x 10(5) m-1 s-1 at  20 degrees c and ph 7.3, and the association constant (equilibrium constant) under these conditions is 5.8 x 10(5) m-1. by examination of the amplitude of the fast-phase absorbance change at various wavelengths, it has been determined that  the absorbance change occurring in the fast phase is due to mtx protonation. within the limits of the method it was thus not possible to detect a difference in the rates of binding and of protonation of mtx. the mtx association rate constant is ph dependent, decreasing 330-fold as the ph is decreased from 5.0 to  9.0. the data fit well to a curve generated by assuming a single ionization with  a pka of 6.0 and a ph-independent association rate constant 1000-fold greater for binding of protonated mtx to sfdhfr ii than for binding of unprotonated mtx.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == multiplicity of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin antibiotic resistance determinants.
AB  == bacteria can resist macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin (mls) antibiotics enzymically by alteration of the target site or detoxification of the antibiotic. n6-dimethylation of adenine in 23 s ribosomal rna confers resistance to m, l, and s b-type (mlsb) antibiotics. investigation, by dna annealing, of the relationship between the genes specifying this resistance mechanism from streptococcus (groups a,b,d, and h, and pneumoniae), staphylococcus aureus, bacillus licheniformis, bacteroides fragilis, lactobacillus casei, and streptomyces erythreus indicated substantial sequence diversity among the mlsb resistance (r) determinants. a minimum of four distinct classes of mlsb r determinants could be defined: classes a and b for the gram-positive cocci (streptococci pmeumococci and staphylococci), class c for b. licheniformis, and class d for bact. fragilis. these data do not support the hypothesis that the r determinants were acquired recently from a single common origin and suggest an easy exchange of genetic information among the gram-positive cocci. the genetic classes do not correlate with differences in phenotypic expression or in regulation (inducibility or constitutivity) of resistance towards mlsb antibiotics. inactivation of the drug confers resistance  to m and/or l and/or s or sa or sb antibiotics and has been detected in strains of streptococcus, staph. aureus, lactobacillus, c. perfringens, streptomyces, and recently in the gram-negative organism escherichia coli. we have cloned and sequenced a dna fragment conferring high level resistance (mic greater than 2 g/l) to erythromycin by hydrolysis of the antibiotic. the distribution of this 'new' character in enterobacteria isolated from human faeces was studied by colony hybridization using an intragenic probe. the gene for the erythromycin esterase was detected in numerous strains of e. coli belonging to various biotypes, in klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter agglomerans, and in one 'coliform'. moreover, our results indicated the existence of at least two classes of genes specifying resistance to erythromycin by inactivation of the antibiotic  in enterobacteria.

AB  == a cytoplasmic fructose-1,6-diphosphate-dependent lactate dehydrogenase (ldh; ec 1.1.1.27) from streptococcus mutans omz175 was purified to homogeneity as judged  by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. the purification consisted of ammonium sulfate precipitation of the cytoplasmic fraction, deae-sephacel and blue-sepharose cl.6b chromatography, and sephacryl s200 gel permeation. the catalytic activity of the purified enzyme required the presence of fructose-1,6-diphosphate with a broad optimum between ph 5 and 6.2. the concentration of fructose-1,6-diphosphate required for half-maximal velocity was  around 0.02 mm and was affected by the pyruvate concentration. the enzyme seemed  to have at least two binding sites for the activator which interact in a cooperative manner. increasing concentrations of fructose-1,6-diphosphate up to 2 mm enhanced the relative affinity of the enzyme for pyruvate and modified the pyruvate saturation curve from sigmoidal to hyperbolic. the enzyme activity showed also a sigmoidal response to nadh, exhibiting two binding sites for the cofactor with a hill coefficient of about 1.9. the molecular weight of the native enzyme was 150,000 as determined by gel permeation on sephacryl s200. monomers (38,000 daltons) and dimers (85,000 daltons) were observed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis; the latter form was dissociated after reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol, and the enzyme could be considered a tetramer. antibodies obtained against the purified s. mutans omz175 ldh cross-reacted with the sodium  dodecyl sulfate-dissociated forms of ldhs from different s. mutans serotypes, streptococcus sanguis omz9, lactobacillus casei atcc 4646, and actinomyces viscosus ny 1. a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay allowed us to detect a very close relationship between the native states of l-ldhs from s. mutans serotypes and s. sanguis. cross-reactions were also observed with the ldhs from a. viscosus and l. casei, the latter being the least related. a very weak immunological relationship was obtained between the l-ldh from s. mutans omz175 and the d-ldh from lactobacillus leichmannii, whereas no cross-reaction could be  detected with mammal ldhs.

TI  == species-specific irreversible inhibition of neisseria gonorrhoeae dihydrofolate reductase by a substituted 2,4-diamino-5-benzylpyrimidine.
AB  == neisseria gonorrhoeae dihydrofolate reductase undergoes a time-dependent, irreversible inactivation by 2,4-diamino-5-[3,5-dimethoxy-4-(p-bromoacetamidophenoxy)benzyl] pyrimidine. the kinetics of inactivation are consistent with the reversible formation of an enzyme-inhibitor complex followed by covalent binding to the enzyme. the reversible component is competitive with dihydrofolate and has an inhibitor binding constant of 10 nm. irreversible inactivation proceeds as a pseudo first-order process with a minimum inactivation half-time of 20 min and a ki of 28 nm. using radiolabeled inhibitor, it was shown that approximately 1 mol of ligand was covalently bound to the enzyme/mol of methotrexate binding site when the enzyme was completely inhibited. radiolabeled inhibitor remained associated with the enzyme following denaturation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide  gel electrophoresis. cyanogen bromide cleavage of the 14c-labeled enzyme-inhibitor complex yielded only one radioactive polypeptide, and sequence determinations showed that his-25 was modified by covalent attachment of the inhibitor. when dihydrofolate reductases from lactobacillus casei, streptococcus  faecium, escherichia coli, sr-1 rodent lymphoma, and chicken liver were tested with the affinity label, only the l. casei enzyme showed a time-dependent increase in inhibition. these data, along with comparisons of known amino acid sequences and x-ray crystal structures, were used to make predictions concerning  the three-dimensional conformation of the gonococcal enzyme.

AB  == compared with anion-activated cell lysis of oral bacteria damaged with either lysozyme or trypsin, cells which were treated with both of these enzymes showed a far greater degree of lysis. this was true regardless of whether turbidimetric, dna release, or electron microscopic assays were used to monitor the lytic process. at an acidic ph of 5.2 and an nahco3 concentration of 100 mm, the kinetics of lysis for two different serotype c strains of streptococcus mutans were similar. at 0 to 100 mm bicarbonate, however, differences in the lytic susceptibilities of the two strains were evident. at ph 5.2, nahco3, but not nascn, nacl, or naf, was effective in promoting cell lysis of the oral bacteria.  at apparent sublytic concentrations of nahco3, lysis was achieved by adding appropriate concentrations of nascn, nacl, or naf to the lysozyme-protease-damaged cells. in in vivo studies, hamsters given a combination of nahco3, nacl, and nascn were found to have significantly reduced levels of s.  mutans on their molar teeth compared with that found in controls or animals exposed to any one of the salts alone or to a combination of chloride and thiocyanate only. the results suggest that bicarbonate is an essential anion which, together with the other major salivary inorganic monovalent anions, plays  an active role in the lysis and ultimate elimination of cariogenic bacteria.

TI  == dismutation of dihydrofolate by dihydrofolate reductase.
AB  == degradation of 7,8-dihydrofolate (h2folate) in the presence of dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) has been shown due not to an oxygenase activity of the reductase as previously reported but to dismutation of h2folate to folate and 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate (h4folate). the reaction can be followed spectrophotometrically or by analysis of the reaction mixture by high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). the products have also been isolated and characterized. oxygen uptake during the reaction is much less than stoichiometric with h2folate disappearance and is attributed to autoxidation of the h4folate formed. the dismutation activity is a property of highly purified streptococcus faecium dhfr isoenzyme 2 (but not isoenzyme 1) and of lactobacillus casei dhfr, but not of bovine liver dhfr. the activity is dependent on tightly bound nadp+ and/or nadph. removal of the nucleotide results in loss of dismutation activity,  which is restored by adding nadp+ or nadph. maximum activity is obtained when approximately 1 mol equiv of nucleotide is added per mol of dhfr. it is proposed  that in the dismutation reaction bound nadp(h) is alternately reduced and oxidized by incoming molecules of h2folate with release of folate and h4folate, respectively. the relatively slow rate of folate formation presumably limits the  rate of the overall reaction. the equilibrium constant for the dismutation reaction is 19.4 +/- 7.4 at 22 degrees c and ph 7.0. calculation of standard oxidation-reduction potentials at ph 7 gave values of -0.230 v for the h2folate/h4 folate pair and -0.268 v for the folate/h2folate pair. the mechanism  by which nadp+ is retained by the enzyme from some sources during purification procedures is unclear.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == polyvinyl chloride membrane electrodes sensitive to tetraphenyl phosphonium (tpp+), butyltriphenyl phosphonium ( btpp +), and methyltriphenyl phosphonium ( mtpp +) ions have been compared for the determination of the electrical potential difference (delta psi) of the oral bacteria, streptococcus mutans dr0001 /6 and lactobacillus casei rb1014 . all three types of electrode proved suitable for determining delta psi, although the tpp+-sensitive electrode was particularly susceptible to interference by protonmotive force (delta p) dissipators known to  inhibit sugar uptake by the bacteria. the mtpp +-sensitive electrode was the least affected. similarly, both strains had a high nonspecific binding capacity for tpp+ and btpp + ions, and this increased for all three ions when the bacteria were heated to 80 degrees c for 1 h to abolish glucose uptake and metabolism. this heat-treatment procedure is therefore not a suitable control for determination of nonspecific binding to cells. however, 1% (v/v) toluene, 20 microm gramicidin, or 10 microm valinomycin effectively depolarized the bacteria  without interfering with nonspecific binding. the ionophores were therefore used  subsequently for the determination of nonspecific binding of the lipid-soluble cations. the mtpp + ion and corresponding electrode proved the most effective system, and delta psi values of -89 and -107 mv were obtained for s. mutans and l. casei, respectively, harvested from glucose-limited continuous cultures and incubated in 100 mm hepes-koh buffer (ph 7.0), containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 10 mm glucose. although the delta psi of s. mutans decreased significantly in the presence of mes-koh and potassium phosphate buffers at ph 7.0, it increased to -119 mv in tris-hcl buffer (ph 7.0).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == evidence for presence of a xylitol phosphotransferase system in streptococcus mutans omz 176.
AB  == a cariogenic bacterial strain, streptococcus mutans omz 176, was found to be able to take up xylitol by a phosphotransferase system (pts) in spite of lack of ability to catabolize this pentitol. a metabolite with an rf value in tlc similar to xylitol 5-phosphate was extracted from resting cells which had been exposed to 14c xylitol. phosphatase treatment of this metabolite yielded xylitol. it is suggested that the inhibition of growth of strep. mutans observed in several laboratories can be explained in terms of accumulation of xylitol phosphate (presumably xylitol 5-phosphate) inside the cells. it is furthermore suggested that xylitol is transported and phosphorylated through the fructose pts.

AB  == the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent xylitol:phosphotransferase system of lactobacillus casei strain c183 requires a small, soluble, substrate-specific protein for catalytic activity. designated enzyme iiixtl (or iiixtl), the protein was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity and characterized. iiixtl, as purified, is a single polypeptide composed of 109 amino acid residues. it has an  estimated molecular weight of 12,000 and is hydrophobic in nature. the hydrophobicity of iiixtl is apparently due to the fact that the enzyme was isolated as the phosphorylated phosphocarrier protein. removal of the phosphate group with alkaline phosphatase results in the loss of immunological cross-reactivity with anti-p-iiixtl and an alteration in charge. the l. casei c183 iiixtl is antigenically related to enzymes iiixtl in streptococcus avium and other, genetically distinct strains of l. casei.

TI  == protonated state of methotrexate, trimethoprim, and pyrimethamine bound to dihydrofolate reductase.
AB  == 13c nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) of methotrexate, trimethoprim, and pyrimethamine enriched 90% with 13c at c2 has provided a sensitive means of detecting the state of protonation of the heterocyclic rings of these inhibitors. in each case, protonation of n1 causes an upfield movement of the chemical shift  of c2 by more than 6 ppm. by this method it has been shown that, at ph values up  to 9.2, methotrexate is bound to bovine liver dihydrofolate reductase with n1 of  the inhibitor protonated, just as in the case of the complex with reductase from  streptococcus faecium and lactobacillus casei. furthermore, trimethoprim bound to reductase from any of the three sources, and pyrimethamine bound to either of the bacterial reductases also have n1 protonated even at ph values up to 10. this implies that in all cases there is a strong interaction between protonated n1 of  the inhibitor and the carboxylate group of the active site aspartate or glutamate. in every case pka of the bound inhibitor is increased by several units, a finding in accord with crystallographic evidence that inhibitor bound to l. casei reductase is in a hydrophobic environment and that n1 is not hydrogen-bonded to water. it was confirmed by titration of protein fluorescence that trimethoprim has greater affinity for bacterial reductase than for vertebrate (bovine) reductase, and that this selectivity is more marked in ternary complexes in which nadph is also bound to the active site. however, the data cited above indicate that this difference in affinities is not due to a weaker ionic interaction between protonated n1 of trimethoprim and the bovine enzyme. instead, binding of the trimethoprim side chain to hydrophobic sites on the enzyme must provide less binding energy in the case of the mammalian enzyme.

AB  == we have isolated and determined the nucleotide sequence of a 1,626-base-pair fragment from r-plasmid r483 which encodes a trimethoprim-resistant dihydrofolate reductase. analysis of the nucleotide sequence of this fragment revealed the presence of two open reading frames, each sufficient to encode polypeptides of approximately 17,000 daltons. both open regions are preceded by sequences conforming closely to the canonical description of procaryotic promoters. a 490-base-pair hpai fragment spanning one of the potential coding regions was inserted into a plasmid vector under the transcriptional control of the trp promoter. cells transformed with this plasmid were trimethoprim resistant and produced dihydrofolate reductase activity which in vitro was resistant to moderate levels of trimethoprim. analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of this protein indicated that the r483-encoded trimethoprim-resistant enzyme was distantly related to the trimethoprim-sensitive bacterial homologs. the conserved amino acids were localized primarily to the region of the enzyme previously shown to comprise the hydrophobic substrate binding pocket.

AB  == the substrate specificities of folylpolyglutamate synthetases from corynebacterium species, lactobacillus casei, streptococcus faecalis, and chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells are described. the purified corynebacterium enzyme catalyzes the addition of glutamate moieties to reduced pteroylmonoglutamates, and to 5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroyldi- and triglutamates. the purified protein also possesses a separate dihydrofolate synthetase activity. binding of pteroate  substrates to dihydrofolate synthetase impairs folate binding to folylpolyglutamate synthetase. the in vivo distribution of folylpolyglutamates in bacteria and mammalian cells, which differs from source to source, appears to be  a reflection of the ability of folylpolyglutamates to act as substrates for folylpolyglutamate synthetases from different sources. bacterial synthetases use  a variety of pteroylmonoglutamates as their preferred monoglutamate substrate, but use 5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroyl polyglutamates as their preferred, and sometimes only, polyglutamate substrates. mono- and polyglutamyl forms of tetrahydrofolate are the preferred substrates of the cho cell synthetase. products of one carbon metabolism do not affect the in vivo distribution of folylpolyglutamates in cho cells. although adenine changes the distribution of folylpolyglutamates in bacteria, this effect is mediated by changing the substrate availability for the synthetase reaction, and not by regulating the levels of the synthetase per se.

AB  == fluorimetric titration has been used to measure the dissociation constants for the complexes of folate, pteroyltriglutamate and pteroylheptaglutamate with dihydrofolate reductase purified from lactobacillus casei, streptococcus faecium  (isoenzyme 2) and bovine liver. effects of ph, temperature, salt concentration and second ligands have been examined. the method is shown to be unsuitable for methotrexate complexes. the polyglutamates do not bind more tightly than folate to the s. faecium reductase under any conditions examined, but bind somewhat more tightly than folate to the l. casei reductase at low ph (less than 7) and to the  bovine liver enzyme at ph 7-9. increasing concentrations of kc1 decrease the binding of all three ligands to the l. casei and bovine liver enzymes. increasing ph markedly raises the dissociation constants for all complexes of the l. casei reductase, but has only slight effects on the complexes of the s. faecium reductase. complexes of the bovine enzyme are affected to an intermediate degree  by ph, but the folate complex is affected much more than those of the polyglutamates. model building studies have been performed with a three-dimensional model of the complex of l. casei reductase with nadph and methotrexate. additional glutamyl groups were added in gamma-linkage to the glutamate moiety of the complexed methotrexate. a proposed mode of binding of the pteroyl polyglutamates is discussed and sequence comparisons are used to predict  residues that might be involved in polyglutamate binding by reductase from other  sources.

AB  == dihydrofolate reductase isozyme 2 of streptococcus faecium has been labeled with  13c in the c gamma position of tryptophan residues by growing the organism on a defined medium containing l-[gamma-13c]tryptophan (90% 13c). the 13c nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectrum of the enzyme shows four well-resolved resonances which have nuclear overhauser enhancements of 1.1-1.3. values of t1 (spin-lattice relaxation time) and t2 (spin-spin relaxation time) are significantly less than predicted for an isotropically rotating, rigid sphere with no intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. three of the resonances have chemical shifts downfield from the 13c resonance of urea-denatured enzyme by amounts up to 1.43 ppm. the chemical shift of resonance 4 in the spectrum is 4.0  ppm upfield from trp c gamma of urea-denatured enzyme. this large upfield shift is attributed to electric field effects generated by polar side chains. the two more upfield peaks both provide evidence that the corresponding tryptophan residues, wc and wd, each undergo chemical exchange between alternative microenvironments. in the case of wc, which gives a resonance with two components, exchange is slow (ve, exchange rate much less than 55 s-1), and the relative populations of the two stable states are in the ratio 2:3. wd is apparently in intermediate to fast exchange on the nmr time scale. with a two-state model, ve increases from approximately 90 to 150 s-1 as the temperature is increased from 5 to 25 degrees c. this increases in temperature is also accompanied by an increase in the fractional population of the minor downfield state(s), from about 0.062 at 5 degrees c to 0.24 at 25 degrees c. however, the data may also be interpreted as a temperature-dependent equilibrium between a continuum of many states. wd is tentatively identified with trp-22 since comparison of the sequences of lactobacillus casei dihydrofolate reductase and s. faecium dihydrofolate reductase and inspection of the crystal structure of the l. casei enzyme indicate that trp-6, trp-115, and trp-160 are probably all involved  in regions of beta sheet whereas trp-22 is in a loop joining beta a to alpha b. earlier crystallographic evidence for the escherichia coli reductase suggests that in the methotrexate complex with this enzyme the corresponding loop has a good deal of flexibility. it is probable that in the uncomplexed s. faecium reductase the motion of this loop is the major mechanism for the exchange process involving trp-22. the upfield chemical shift of resonance 4 is attributed to electric field effects on c gamma of trp-22 produced by the carboxylate groups of asp-27 and asp-9. on the basis of the small difference between the chemical shift of resonance 3 and that of tryptophan c gamma in urea-denatured reductase, it is  suggested that wc may be identified with trp-6.

TI  == new synthesis of n-[4-[[(2-amino-4(3h)-oxopyrido[3,2-d]pyrimidin-6-yl)methyl]amino]benzoyl]-l-glut amic acid (8-deazafolic acid) and the preparation of some 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro derivatives.
AB  == previously, 8-deazafolic acid (17) was shown to be a potent inhibitor of the folate-dependent bacteria, streptococcus faecium (atcc 8043) and lactobacillus casei (atcc 7469), and to have activity against lymphoid leukemia l1210 in mice.  to examine the 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro derivatives, a new synthesis of 17 was developed from 8-deaza-2,4-dichloro-6-methylpteridine. treatment of the latter with aqueous base gave the corresponding pteridin-4(3h)-one, which was aminated with ammonia to give 8-deaza-6-methylpterin (9). bromination of 9 gave mainly 8-deaza-6-(tribromomethyl)pterin, which on reaction with p-aminobenzoyl-l-glutamic acid resulted in the formation of the 9-oxo derivative  of 17. in contrast, bromination of the 2-acetyl derivative of 9 gave mainly the corresponding 6-(bromomethyl)pterin, which was converted to 17 in 23% yield (from 9). hydrogenation of 17 at atmospheric pressure and room temperature was unsuccessful either in a basic medium or formic acid. in trifluoroacetic acid, overreduction occurred to give a mixture containing 8-deaza-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-6-methylpterin and the 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro derivative of 17. the latter was characterized by conversion to the methenyl analogue 21, which was also prepared by hydrogenation of the 10-formyl derivative of 17. treatment of 21 with hydroxide gave 8-deaza-10-formyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic acid. compound 21 showed cytotoxicity to cultured h.ep.-2 cells and was tested as an inhibitor of bovine dihydrofolic reductase. lineweaver-burk analysis indicated inhibition competitive with dihydrofolate.

TI  == folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthesis by bacteria and mammalian cells.
AB  == the purification and properties of folylpolyglutamate synthetase from corynebacterium sp, and some properties of partially purified enzyme from lactobacillus casei, streptococcus faecalis, neurospora crassa, pig liver, and chinese hamster ovary cells, are described. the corynebacterium enzyme catalyzes  a mgatp-dependent addition of glutamate to a variety of reduced pteroate and pteroylmono-, di-, and triglutamate substrates, with the concomitant production of mgadp and phosphate. although glutamate moieties are added in a sequential fashion, the kinetic mechanism, which is ordered ter ter, precludes the sequential addition of glutamate moieties to enzyme-bound folate. it is suggested that catalysis precedes via the formation of a pteroyl-gamma-glutamyl phosphate intermediate. the in vivo distribution of folylpolyglutamates in bacteria and mammalian cells, which differ from source to source, appear to be a reflection of the ability of folylpolyglutamates to act as substrates for folylpolyglutamate synthetases from different sources. only one enzyme appears to be involved in the conversion of pteroylmonoglutamates to polyglutamate forms in both bacteria and mammalian cells. bacterial folylpolyglutamate synthetases use a variety of pteroylmonoglutamates as their preferred monoglutamate substrate, but use 5,10-methylenetetrahydro-pteroylpolyglutamates as their preferred, and sometimes  only, polyglutamate substrate. mono- and polyglutamyl forms of tetrahydrofolate are the preferred substrates of mammalian folylpolyglutamate synthetases.

TI  == folate analogues altered in the c9-n10 bridge region. 18. synthesis and antitumor evaluation of 11-oxahomoaminopterin and related compounds.
AB  == the chemical synthesis of 11-oxahomoaminopterin (1) has been carried out using procedures which were also found to be applicable to the synthesis of 11-oxahomofolic acid (2). reaction of 1-bromo-4-[p-(caarbomethoxy)phenoxy]-2-butanone (10) with sodium azide gave 1-azido-4-[p-(carbomethoxy)phenoxy]-2-butanone (11). protection of the carbonyl group of 11 as the ethylene ketal and subsequent base hydrolysis of the product gave 1-azido-4-(p-carboxyphenoxy)-2-butanone ketal (13). the glutamate conjugate  14 was prepared from 13 by the isobutyl chloroformate method and was hydrogenated to diethyl n-[(alpha-amino-2-oxo-4-butanoyl)-p-anisoyl]-l-glutamate ketal (15). reaction of 15 with 6-chloro-2,4-diamino-5-nitropyrimidine (16) and 2-amino-6-chloro-4-hydroxy-5-nitropyrimidine (17) and deprotection of the corresponding products gave the intermediates 18 and 19, which were elaborated to 1 and 2 using a series of steps involving deprotection, dithionite reduction, cyclization, oxidation, and hydrolysis. although 11-oxahomoaminopterin showed antifolate activity against two folate-requiring microorganisms and inhibited lactobacillus casei dhfr, it was inactive against l-1210 leukemia in mice at a maximum dose of 48 mg/kg. compound lactobacillus casei dhfr, it was inactive against l-1210 leukemia in mice at a maximum dose of 48 mg/kg. compound 1 was also tested for its ability to be transported via the methotrexate transport system using the l-1210 and ehrlich tumor cell lines, and these results are compared with those of related analogues. the growth inhibitory activity of 1 in  the l-1210 cell lines in culture was found to be 15 times weaker than that of methotrexate.

TI  == oral ecology and virulence of lactobacillus casei and streptococcus mutans in gnotobiotic rats.
AB  == lactobacilli comprise a small percentage of the normal oral microbial flora of humans and are isolated commonly from saliva and frequently from an active caries lesion. we have compared the pathogenesis and colonization pattern of lactobacillus casei with that of streptococcus mutans strain 6715 in gnotobiotic  rats. of the two l. casei strains tested, l. casei strain atcc 4646 caused slightly more caries than l. casei strain atcc 11578. however, the level of caries induced by either l. casei strain was significantly lower (p less than 0.01) than that observed in similar-aged rats monoassociated with s. mutans strain 6715. when groups of rats were infected with mixtures of l. casei strain atcc 4646 and s. mutans strain 6715, or with l. casei followed by s. mutans, higher numbers of l. casei than s. mutans were found associated with the tongue and in saliva; s. mutans always predominated in plaque. the level of caries observed in these groups of rats was similar to that seen with rats monoassociated with s. mutans except when l. casei comprised greater than 1% of the plaque microflora. in this latter situation, the level of caries was significantly lower (p less than or equal to 0.05) than that obtained in s. mutans-monoassociated rats. the results of this study suggest that l. casei colonizes sites in the oral cavity (including the tongue and saliva) other than the tooth surface in rats. the effect of l. casei in plaque toward reduction of s. mutans-induced dental caries in rats is discussed.

TI  == the metabolism of folinic acid (leucovorin) following oral and parenteral administration.
AB  == serum and urinary distributions of following oral and parenteral administration of leucovorin (3-15 mg) were examined in normal adult volunteers microbiologically using lactobacillus casei, streptococcus faecalis and pediococcus cerevisiae as test organisms. by the parenteral route, nearly one-third of the folate in the serum and urine was in the form of folinic acid and the remainder as 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid. almost all the folate in serum and urine was in the form of 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid after oral administration. peak serum folate was observed 3 hr after oral administration, later than that seen after parenteral administration (30 min). elevation of serum folate was achieved by the increase of the methyl form of folate following repeated administration of leucovorin orally and parenterally. as the form of folate actually rescuing normal cells in a high-dose methotrexate regimen was thought to be methyl, use of the oral route as a principal means of administration of leucovorin in a rescue program was looked into.

AB  == the synthesis of 11-thiohomoaminopterin (1), which is a close analogue of 11-thiohomofolic acid (2), has been carried out by modification of the boon-leigh procedure. treatment of 1-chloro-4-[p-(carbomethoxy)thiopenoxy]-2-butanone (5) with sodium azide gave 1-azido-4-[p-(carbomethoxy)thiophenoxy]-2-butanone (6). after protection of the carbonyl group of 6, the product 7 was catalytically hydrogenated to 1-amino-4-[p-(carbomethoxy)thiophenoxy]-2-butanone ketal (3). reaction of 32 with 6-chloro-2,4-diaminmo-5-nitropyrimidine gave the desired pyrimidine intermediate, which was elaborated to 4-amino-4-deoxy-11-thiohomopteroic acid (20) by standard procedures. alternately, 1-azido-4-[p-(carbomethoxy)thiophenoxy]-2-butanone ketal (7) was hydrolyzed to the corresponding acid (8) and coupled with diethyl l-glutamate to obtain diethyl n-[p-(1-azido-2-oxo-4-thiobutanoyl)benzoyl]-l-glutamate ketal (10), which was used for the large-scale preparation of 11-thiohomoaminopterin (1). although 11-thiohomoaminopterin showed antifolate activity against two folate-requiring microorganisms and inhibited lactobacillus casei dihydrogolate reductase, it did  not exhibit any antitumor activity against l-1210 lymphoid leukemia in mice at a  maximum dose of 48 mg/kg.

TI  == interaction of streptococcus mutans glucosyltransferases with teichoic acids.
AB  == the streptococcus mutans gs5 glucosyltransferase activities (both water-soluble and -insoluble glucan-synthesizing fractions) were inhibited by purified lipoteichoic acid. in vitro sucrose-dependent colonization of smooth surfaces by  strain gs5 was also markedly reduced in the presence of the amphipathic molecules. the inhibition of soluble glucan synthesis by lipoteichoic acid appeared to be competitive with respect to both sucrose and primer dextran t10. these inhibitory effects were dependent on the presence of the fatty acid components of lipoteichoic acid since deacylated lipoteichoic acids did not inhibit glucosyltransferase activity. however, the deacylated molecules did interact with the enzymes since deacylated lipoteichoic acid partially protected  the enzyme activity against heat inactivation and also induced the formation of high-molecular-weight enzyme complexes from the soluble glucan-synthesizing fraction. the presence of teichoic acid in high-molecular-weight aggregates of glucosyltransferase isolated from the culture fluids of strain gs5 was suggested  by the detection of polyglycerophosphate in these fractions. in addition to strain gs5, two other organisms containing polyglycerophosphate teichoic acids, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus fermentum, were demonstrated to bind glucosyltransferase activity. these results are discussed relative to the potential role of teichoic acid-glucosyltransferase interactions in enzyme binding to the cell surface of s. mutans and the formation of high-molecular-weight enzyme aggregates in the culture fluids of the organism.

TI  == role of bacterial interactions in the colonization of oral surfaces of actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == the effects of several microbial residents of human oral cavities on the attachment of actinomyces viscosus t14v to tooth surfaces were assessed by using  the saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha) in vitro system. attachment to sha by a. viscosus t14v was not inhibited in the presence of streptococcus mutans gs5, either in the presence or absence of sucrose. precoating sha beads with s. mutans in the presence of sucrose also did not retard strain t14v attachment. however, the presence of streptococcus sanguis m5 during strain t14v attachment markedly inhibited the interaction of a. viscosus t14v with sha, whereas another s. sanguis strain, strain g9b, produced relatively weak inhibition. the inhibitory effect of s. sanguis m5 appeared to result from the direct interaction of this organism with a. viscosus t14v. conversely, the presence of strain t14v markedly  increased the attachment of s. sanguis m5 to sha while partially inhibiting the attachment of s. sanguis g9b. moreover, sha beads precoated with a. viscosus t14v bound much higher levels of s. sanguis m5 relative to uncoated sha, whereas s. sanguis g9b attachment was only weakly inhibited. it was also observed that sha beads precoated with either s. sanguis m5 or g9b inhibited subsequent attachment  by strain t14v. these results suggest the possibility that the attachment sites for both s. sanguis strains partially overlap those for a. viscosus t14v. streptococcus mitis weakly inhibited attachment of strain t14v to sha, and both streptococcus salivarius and lactobacillus casei had little effect on attachment. in addition, both a radioisotope attachment assay and fluorescent microscopy demonstrated no significant attachment of a. viscosus t14v to human epithelial cells.

TI  == primary structure of chicken liver dihydrofolate reductase.
AB  == the complete covalent structure of dihydrofolate reductase from chicken liver is  described. the s-carboxymethylated protein was subjected to cleavage by cyanogen  bromide which produced five fragments. fragment cb2 contained an internal homoserine residue which was not cleaved by cyanogen bromide. sequences and ordering of the cyanogen bromide fragments were established by means of automated sequencer analyses of the fragments and from smaller peptides generated by proteolysis with trypsin and staphylococcal protease. the covalent structure of the single polypeptide chain comprises 189 residues of molecular weight 21,651. the chicken liver enzyme is homologous to that from l1210 cells and shows regions of homology to dihydrofolate reductases from streptococcus faecium, escherichia coli, and lactobacillus casei. these homologous regions in the chicken liver enzyme are primarily related to conserved amino acid residues implicated in the binding of nadph and methotrexate by bacterial dihydrofolate reductases.

AB  == a cell disrupter has been developed which can measure the forces required to disrupt both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. it operates a continuous process and will disrupt both large and small volumes. shear forces are set up when a suspension under laminar flow conditions is released under high pressure through  a short orifice. if the applied pressure is altered, the shear forces are simultaneously changed so that the amount of cell disruption can be compared under different known and repeatable conditions. the disrupter is now manufactured and supplied by stansted fluid power limited, stansted, england. phase-contrast microscopy has shown that the disrupter will break a variety of organisms including chlorella, aspergillus fumigatis, fusarium sp., saccharomyces cerevisiae, escherichia coli, lactobacillus casei, bacillus subtilis, clostridium perfringens, streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus zooepidermicus and staphylococcus aureus. the cells are not all broken at one pressure but a certain pressure must be applied before disruption starts which will then increase rapidly as the applied pressure is increased. the applied pressure required to disrupt half the population in a culture is different from one species to another, rods being disrupted more easily than spheres. the case of disruption seems to be related to the shape and chemical composition of the cell wall. furthermore, the disrupting process, in an unsynchronized culture is not random and may be related to the statistical size distribution of the cells.

AB  == the complete amino acid sequence of dihydrofolate reductase from an amethopterin-resistant strain of lactobacillus casei has been determined by sequence analysis of peptides produced by cleavage with cyanogen bromide, trypsin, staphylococcal protease, and myxobacter protease. comparison of this sequence with those of reductases from other bacterial sources shows that the enzymes are homologous. the lactobacillus casei reductase sequences shows a 29% sequence identity with that of the escherichia coli enzyme and a 34% identity with the sequence of the enzyme from streptococcus faecium. the nh2-terminal 68 residues of the l. casei reductase show a 54% sequence identity with that of the  enzyme from s. faecium.

TI  == a microbiologic disc assay for 5-methyltetrahydrofolate in the presence of methotrexate.
AB  == high-dose methotrexate-citrovorum factor rescue regimens are used extensively for the treatment of human malignancies. since the rescue agent citrovorum factor is  rapidly converted to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, it is desirable to follow the distribution kinetics of both of these coenzymes to assess the selective therapeutic effectiveness of the regimen. the assay methods using methotrexate-resistant strains of lactobacillus casei atcc 7469 (lc/a), streptococcus faecium var. durans atcc 8043 (sf/a), and pediococcus cerevisiae atcc 8081 (pc/a) have been developed to determine the concentrations of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and other folates in the presence of methotrexate. since lc/a determines the total folates, sf/a deterimines the total folates except 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, and pc/a by our procedure determines only the most stable form of reduced folates, citrovorum factor, the quantitation of both 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and citrovorum factor can very easily be achieved by differential assays. this report describes the determination of as low as 10 ng/ml of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate in the presence of as high as 500 microgram/ml  of methotrexate. the assay method described here is currently used in studying the pharmacokinetics of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate in patients with meningeal neoplasms.

AB  == sucrose metabolism by resting-cell suspensions of pure cultures of representative members of the predominant cultivable flora isolated from cariogenic and non-cariogenic dental plaque was investigated by means of radiochemical techniques. streptocococcus mutans utilized sucrose at a considerably faster rate than s. sanguis, s. mitis, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, or lactobacillus  casei, forming lactic acid, intracellular polysaccharide, insoluble extracellular glucan, and lactic acid from intracellular polysaccharide catabolism at faster rates than the other bacteria. the actinomyces formed more volatile acids than the streptococci, mostly acetic, and s. sanguis formed more soluble extracellular polysaccharide than the other bacteria. the metabolic activity of s. mutans resembled the pattern of sucrose metabolism of cariogenic plaque, whereas the metabolic activity of the actinomyces species, the predominant members of non-cariogenic plaque flora, resembled the sucrose metabolism of non-cariogenic plaques.

TI  == microbiologic assays of cancer chemotherapeutic agents.
AB  == among various assay methods available for the study of drug distribution kinetics in cancer chemotherapy, a method that determines the drug in its active form is the most desirable. the microbiologic assay method, with its rapid, simple, and inexpensive procedures, fulfills such a requirement. besides the two commonly used chemotherapeutic agents, methotrexate and cytosine arabinoside, microbiologic assays are available for other chemotherapeutic agents, such as 6-mercaptopurine, 5-fluorouracil, actinomycin d, adriamycin, and daunorubicin. assays have been developed for citrovorum factor and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate in  the presence of high levels of methotrexate. with the introduction of combination chemotherapy, microbiologic assay methods using resistant mutants, sensitive to a single drug but resistant (either due to mutation or due to culture conditions) to all other drugs involved in the combination, could well be the most efficient  for the study of distribution kinetics. several such assay methods employed in our laboratory are discussed.

TI  == serum folates in man.
AB  == in an aseptic microbiological assay of folate compounds and their breakdown compounds, using lactobacillus casei, streptococcus faecalis, and pediococcus cerevisiae, 4a-hydroxy-5methyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrofolate and 5-methyl-5,8-dihydrofolate were inactive under all conditions to all three organisms and 5-methyl-5,6-dihydrofolate was inactive unless ascorbate was present in the incubation medium, and then only to l. casei. 5-methyltetrahydrofolate was active only for l. casei, and activity in purified samples to s. faecalis was due to trace amounts of folic acid. analysis of s. faecalis values in the serum in normal subjects and in patients with various disorders showed that levels of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate are raised in coeliac disease, leukaemia, rheumatoid arthritis, and schizophrenia. 5-methyltetrahydrofolate is readily absorbed by normal human subjects and by patients with pernicious anaemia but poorly absorbed by patients with coeliac disease or leukaemia. 5-methyl-5,6-dihydrofolate was quickly absorbed by normal human subjects, being reflected by a considerably raised level of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate in serum when sodium bicarbonate was given by mouth before the 5-methyl-5,6-dihydrofolate. these higher levels were comparable to those in patients with pernicious anaemia after oral administration of 5-methyl-5,6-dihydrofolate. oral 5-methyl-5,8-dihydrofolate and 4a-hydroxy-5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate did not appear as microbiologically active folates in the serum. the findings of this study suggest that the availability for biological utilisation of the major dietary folate compounds will depend on the amount of gastric acidity and of ascorbate in the intestinal chyme. many may  be unavailable for metabolic utilization in the body.

TI  == relationship of cytochrome content to the sensitivity of bacteria to nacl on freezing and thawing.
AB  == eight species of bacteria representing rod, coccus, gram-positive, and gram-negative forms were tested for their sensitivity to sodium chloride during freezing and thawing. six of the eight species tested were salt-sensitive, though to different degrees, while lactobacillus casei and streptococcus faecalis were resistant. escherichia coli grown anaerobically exhibited only 38% of the salt sensitivity of aerobically grown cells. analysis of cytochrome pigments in the organisms revealed that the six sensitive organisms all contained these pigments  but in varying amounts, while the two resistant ones were devoid of them. anaerobically grown e. coli contained 50% of the cytochromes of aerobically grown cells. a relationship between cytochrome content of the organisms and salt sensitivity during freezing and thawing was demonstrated with a correlation coefficient of 0.76 (p less than 0.05); the higher the cytochrome content, the more salt-sensitive the organism. this indicated that 58% of the salt sensitivity was due to the cytochrome content. using a model organism e. coli, the effect of  salt during freezing and thawing on the respiratory activity was examined. freezing and thawing in water or saline decreased the respiration by whole cells  of substrates expected to be nad-linked while nadh-stimulated respiration was increased. in cell-free extracts derived from unfrozen cells or those frozen and  thawed in water or saline, the respiration of ascorbate plus n,n,n',n'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (tmpd) was constant. the respiration of  nadh, succinate, and lactate in cell-free extracts derived from cells frozen and  thawed in saline was reduced compared with those extracts derived from unfrozen cells or cells frozen and thawed in water. studies with e. coli showed that the decreased respiratory activity caused by disruptions in the electron-transport chain could not account for the salt sensitivity on freezing and thawing. more likely, salt sensitivity is related to the presence of bonds between cytochromes  and other membrane components which are disrupted by sodium chloride on freezing  and thawing. this would then result in loss of membrane integrity and function.

TI  == transport and metabolism of vitamin b6 in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == streptococcus faecalis 8043 concentrates extracellular [3h]pyridoxal or [3h]pyridoxamine primarily as the corresponding 5'-phosphates. accumulation of pyridoxamine requires an exogenous energy source and is inhibited by glycolysis inhibitors. a membrane potential is not required for transport of pyridoxamine, and an artificially generated potential does not drive uptake in this organism. based on this and other evidence, it is concluded that s. faecalis accumulates pyridoxamine by facilitated diffusion in conjunction with trapping by pyridoxal kinase. pyridoxamine-p is not concentrated, but equilibrates with that provided externally. lactobacillus casei 7469 concentrates radioactivity only from pyridoxal, which appears internally as pyridoxal-p, suggesting that it too absorbs the vitamin by facilitated diffusion plus trapping. the specificity of the growth requirement of s. faecalis and l. casei for vitamin b6 parallels the specificity of the transport systems for this vitamin in these organisms. lactobacillus delbrueckii 7469, however, which specifically requires pyridoxamine-p or pyridoxal-p for growth, accumulates both these compounds and pyridoxine-p from the medium, apparently by active transport, but not pyridoxine, pyridoxamine, or pyridoxal. while pyridoxal-p and pyridoxamine-p are interconvertible in this organism, pyridoxine-p is not further metabolized, thus  accounting for the specificity of the growth requirement. these and previous results show (a) that different organisms may employ quite different transport machinery in utilization of a given external nutrient, and (b) that the specificity of the growth requirement for a given form of a vitamin frequently arises from the specificity of transport, but that internal metabolism of the compounds also plays a significant role in some organisms.

TI  == antifolate studies. activities of 40 potential antimalarial compounds against sensitive and chlorguanide triazine resistant strains of folate-requiring bacteria and escherichia coli.
AB  == as part of the search for new antimalarial drugs, a screening program was developed using sensitive and chlorguanide triazine (cgt, cycloguanil) resistant  strains of the folate-requiring bacteria, streptococcus faecium durans, lactobacillus casei, and pediococcus cerevisiae. the activities of 40 compounds have been studied against these strains and escherichia coli. observations have been made on the points of 50% growth inhibition, the fold increase of resistance shown to each compound by the resistant strains as compared with the parent sensitive strains, and the reversal of growth inhibition by folic acid with s. faecium and l. casei by folinic acid with p. cerevisiae and by p-aminobenzoic acid with e. coli. comparisons have been made of the activities of the test compounds with those of the standard antimalarial antifoltes, cgt and pyrimethamine (pm), and the antibacterial results have been compared with the activities of the compounds against plasmodium berghei infections in the mouse and against human malaria infections where data are available. of the 17 compounds reversed by folates, five had patterns of activity similar to cgt and pm in that they were most active against s. faecium and nine compounds exhibited  a different pattern, being highly active against all four test bacteria. this suggests that these latter compounds either have different pharmacokinetic properties or have additional modes of action. the three cgt-resistant organisms  responded to antifolates in different ways. s. faecium (r) and p. cerevisiae (r)  strains were cross resistant to 4,6-diaminotriazines, 2,4-diaminopyrimidines, 2,4-diaminoquinazolines, and active 2,4-diaminopteridines. l. casei (r) was cross resistant to the triazines but was collaterally sensitive to all the other antifolates. most of the compounds not reversed by folates were much less inhibitory for the test organisms; they were most active against l. casei. in general, their growth inhibitory concentrations varied less for the four test organisms and the responses of the sensitive and cgtr strains were similar. however, there was some cross resistance to five compounds and some collateral sensitivity to five others. comparison of the bacteriological data with the activities of the compounds against plasmodium berghei in the mouse showed little correlation between the two test systems; each appears to provide independent and useful information.

AB  == urease activity in the sheep rumen varied with the diet of the sheep, but appeared to be largely or entirely present in the small bacterial fraction. screening of over 1000 strains of rumen bacteria isolated on different media showed that urease activity was apparently confined to species of staphylococcus, lactobacillus casei var. casei and klebsiella aerogenes. consideration of the numbers in which these occurred and their activities suggested that the bacteria  could not be responsible for the total rumen urease activity. by enrichment culture a ureolytic strain of streptococcus faecium was isolated. this had a higher urease activity than the other bacteria and occurred in higher numbers in  the rumen. it could live with other bacteria in the rumen of a gnotobiotic lamb in numbers, and with a urease activity, comparable with those in the normal sheep rumen. the other properties of the bacterium also suggested that it would grow and produce urease in the rumen, but was unlikely to retain its urease activity after isolation. it was concluded that this bacterium was the main source of rumen urease in roughage-fed, and probably other, sheep.

AB  == 1. the effects of injected l-methionine (2g every second day for 28 days) on liver folates and other constituents of liver associated with folate metabolism were studied in vitamin b(12)-deficient ewes and their pair-fed controls receiving vitamin b(12). the dose rate of methionine used was sufficient to restore almost to normal the elevated excretion in the urine of formiminoglutamate in the deficient animals. 2. liver folates active for lactobacillus casei, streptococcus faecalis r and pediococcus cerevisiae were severely depressed in deficient livers and were partly restored by methionine. analysis of the folates after ion-exchange chromatography showed that the major effect of methionine was to increase the concentrations of tetrahydrofolates and  formyltetrahydrofolates. methyltetrahydrofolates were also increased, but there was no effect of methionine on the small amounts of incompletely reduced folates  present in deficient livers. the folates present were predominantly penta-, hexa- and hepta-glutamates whether or not animals received vitamin b(12) or methionine. 3. concentrations of atp, nad(+), nadh and nadph were lower in freeze-clamped liver from vitamin b(12)-deficient sheep than in liver from pair-fed, vitamin b(12)-treated sheep. these changes were not affected by methionine which was also without effect on the elevated k(+)/na(+) ratios found in deficient livers. 4. the livers of vitamin b(12)-deficient animals contained lower concentrations of choline and higher concentrations of lipid than their pair-fed controls. these effects were reversed by methionine.

TI  == identification and measurement of the folates in sheep liver.
AB  == 1. methods are described for the extraction, separation by ion-exchange chromatography and estimation by microbiological assay of the folates in sheep liver. 2. injection of [2-(14)c]-pteroylglutamate into a sheep fed on a stock diet led to extensive labelling of chromatographically separable liver folates. about 12% of the label in the liver could not be extracted by the method used. 3. liver folates were examined in five ewes fed on restricted amounts of a diet of wheaten hay-chaff and gluten and injected weekly with vitamin b(12). chromatographic separation was followed by microbiological assay with lactobacillus casei, streptococcus faecalis r. and pediococcus cerevisiae both before and after treatment of fractions with conjugase (gamma-glutamylcarboxypeptidase). evidence was obtained that the folates present  were predominantly polyglutamate forms of tetrahydropteroylglutamate, 5-methyltetrahydropteroylglutamate and 5- (and 10-) formyltetrahydropteroylglutamates. differences in the responses of the assay organisms permitted quantitative distinction between these three main classes of  folates. 4. methyltetrahydrofolates were eluted in seven successive peaks that were separated by constant increments in the logarithm of eluant [p(i)]. a similar relationship existed for seven successive peaks of tetrahydrofolate and may also have existed for each of the two series of formyltetrahydrofolates. 5. based on these and other observations it is proposed that sheep liver folates consist predominantly of the mono- to hepta-glutamates of each of the reduced pteroates identified. the methods employed allowed quantitative determinations to be made of most of the folates present. the predominant forms were hexaglutamates. 6. four components active for l. casei were detected that could not be identified. three of them were polyglutamates.

AB  == series of strains of streptococcus faecium atcc 8043, lactobacillus casei atcc 7469, and pediococcus cerevisiae atcc 8081 with increasing resistance to the active antifolate antimalarial drugs chlorguanide triazine (cgt), pyrimethamine (pm), and trimethoprim (tmp) were isolated. these mutant strains, stable for at least 3 to 5 years, were examined for cross-resistance and collateral susceptibility to the above compounds and to methotrexate (mtx). generally, they  exhibited cross-resistance to all four compounds, but resistance of a strain to one compound did not predict accurately its resistance to another drug. unexpectedly, l. casei resistant to cgt exhibited collateral susceptibility to mtx, tmp, and pm varying from 5- to 20-fold. p. cerevisiae developed resistance to cgt readily but maintained its susceptibility to pm and tmp after prolonged exposure to these compounds. resistance to these antimalarial antifolates was accompanied by only low-grade cross-resistance to mtx, a representative antileukemic antifolate agent.

TI  == occurrence of glucosamine residues with free amino groups in cell wall peptidoglycan from bacilli as a factor responsible for resistance to lysozyme.
AB  == analysis by dinitrophenylation techniques revealed the occurrence of significant  amounts of glucosamine residues with free amino groups in the peptidoglycan component of cell walls isolated from bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, and bacillus megaterium. a close correlation was demonstrated between the content of  n-unacetylated glucosamine residues in the peptidoglycan component and the resistance of the cell walls to lysozyme. these lysozyme-resistant cell walls and peptidoglycan were converted into a lysozyme-sensitive form by means of n-acetylation with acetic anhydride. thus, the occurrence of the n-unacetylated glucosamine residues in the peptidoglycan component accounts for the resistance of these cell walls to lysozyme. the n-unacetylated glucosamine residues were not found in a significant amount in the cell walls of micrococcus lysodeikticus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, or lactobacillus arabinosus.

TI  == ecology of human oral lactobacilli.
AB  == lactobacilli were found in saliva, on teeth, and on the dorsum of the tongue, the vestibular mucosa, and the hard palate in humans. their proportions in saliva, expressed as percentage of the anaerobically cultivable flora, were 10- to 100-fold higher than those on the tooth surface, but were comparable to those on  the epithelial surfaces. the adherence of lactobacillus casei and l. fermenti to  oral surfaces was compared with that of streptomycin-labeled streptococcus sanguis and s. salivarius by using in vitro-cultivated cells. the affinity of both lactobacillus species for the tooth surface was very low compared with that  of s. sanguis but was somewhat higher than that of s. salivarius. the lactobacilli and both streptococcus species adhered to a similar extent to the dorsum of the tongue, whereas the affinity of the lactobacilli and s. salivarius  for the vestibular mucosa was about one-half of that of s. sanguis. the results suggest that the affinity of lactobacilli for oral surfaces significantly influences their proportional distribution in the mouth. the relatively low affinity of lactobacilli for the tooth surface suggests that their recognized association with carious lesions and mechanical appliances under certain conditions may be due primarily to mechanical retention rather than unique growth conditions.

TI  == localization and interconversion of tetrahydropteroylglutamates in isolated pea mitochondria.
AB  == 1. mitochondria were extracted from 4-day-old pea cotyledons and purified on a sucrose density gradient. 2. microbiological assay of the purified mitochondrial  fraction with lactobacillus casei (a.t.c.c. 7469), streptococcus faecalis (a.t.c.c. 8043) and pediococcus cerevisiae (a.t.c.c. 8081) revealed a discrete pool of conjugated and unconjugated derivatives of tetrahydropteroylglutamic acid. 3. solubilization and chromatographic studies of the mitochondrial fraction demonstrated the presence of formylated and methylated derivatives, 10-formyltetrahydropteroylmonoglutamic acid, 5-formyltetrahydropteroylmonoglutamic acid and 5-formyltetrahydropteroyldiglutamic acid being the major derivatives present. 4.  the principal mitochondrial pteroylglutamates were labelled when dry seeds were allowed to imbibe [2-(14)c]pteroylglutamic acid and 5-[methyl-(14)c]-methyltetrahydropteroylmonoglutamic acid. 5. the ability of isolated mitochondria to catalyse oxidation and reduction of tetrahydropteroylglutamic acid derivatives was demonstrated in feeding experiments in which [(14)c]formaldehyde, [3-(14)c]serine, sodium [(14)c]formate, 5-[methyl-(14)c]methyltetrahydropteroylmonoglutamic acid or [2-(14)c]-glycine served as c(1) donor. in addition, (14)c was incorporated into free amino acids related to c(1) metabolism.

TI  == studies on the absorption and metabolism of folic acid. i. folate absorption in the dog after exposure of isolated intestinal segments to synthetic pteroylpolyglutamates of various chain lengths.
AB  == folic acid absorption was studied in anesthetized dogs by determining the amount  and chemical nature of folate in venous blood emerging from isolated intestinal segments containing free folic acid and/or pteroylpolyglutamates of a known chain length. chromatographically pure test materials placed in the lumen were prepared by unambiguous solid phase synthetic methods. this synthetic procedure not only yields compounds of known structure, it also provides a means by which glutamic acid residues at any given position in the gamma glutamyl chain can be made radioactive. for example, teropterin (pteroyltriglutamate) was synthesized in such a way that (14)c was present only in the middle glutamic acid unit. suitable placement of label permitted assessment of the extent of peptide cleavage. the action of plasma conjugase was inhibited by copper chloride. plasma samples were  analyzed by lactobacillus casei and streptococcus faecalis assay, by column chromatography, and by quantitative measurement of pteridine-bound radioactivity. it was observed that biologically active folate appeared in the mesenteric vein with either pteroylmono-, di-, tri-, penta-, or heptaglutamate in the lumen. generally speaking the absorption rate appeared to be inversely related to the length of the gamma glutamyl side chain. roughly twice as much folic acid appeared in the circulation from (3)h-labeled pteroylmonoglutamate as from (14)c-labeled pteroylpentaglutamate when equimolar amounts of each were placed simultaneously in a single intestinal segment. pteroylmonoglutamate appeared to be the predominant form entering the blood from each of the precursors tested. however, evidence was obtained that pteroyldiglutamate may enter the mesenteric vein soon after placing pteroyldi-, or triglutamate in the lumen, but not with the higher polyglutamates. comparison of radioactivity and biological activity patterns suggests little conversion, if any, to reduced or methylated forms during the first 30 min of passage through the intestinal mucosa. we conclude that both pteroylmonoglutamates and pteroyldiglutamates may across the intestinal mucosa of the dog, and that reduction and methylation are not essential to the absorption process.

TI  == comparative biochemical and immunological study of malic enzyme from two species  of lactic acid bacteria: evolutionary implications.

AB  == a virulent bacteriophage which causes a decrease in acid production during fermentation of a lactic acid beverage named yakult with lactobacillus casei was  isolated from the abnormal fermentation tank and named pl-1. l. casei s strain was the exclusive host cell among 18 lactic acid bacteria tested. the plaque was  round with an average diameter of about 0.5 mm. it exhibited serological cross-reaction with previously isolated j1 phage. under an electron microscope, the phage had a spermatozoon shape, with an icosahedral head (63 nm) and a long tail (12.5 by 275 nm) with about 55 striae. the free phage particles were stable  at ph 5 to 8. the phage was quite sensitive to ultraviolet irradiation or to heating (60 c, 5 min), and the host was more sensitive than the phage to these treatments. many kinds of antimicrobial chemicals were also phagocidal. calcium ion (5 mm) was specifically essential for the phage growth cycle. a one-step growth experiment under optimum conditions (37 c and ph 6.0) showed that the eclipse period was about 75 min, that the latent period was 100 min after the phage infection, and that the average burst size was about 200. the possibility of arresting phage development in lactic acid fermentation is discussed.

TI  == a study of folate absorption and metabolism in man utilizing carbon-14--labeled polyglutamates synthesized by the solid phase method.
AB  == the absorption and metabolism of synthetic polyglutamates of folic acid have been compared with free pteroylglutamic acid in four subjects having chronic lymphatic leukemia and one with hodgkin's granuloma. pteroylpolyglutamates containing either three or seven glutamate residues were prepared by the solid-phase method  permitting placement of carbon-14 labels in either the pteridine ring or in a selected glutamate unit of the gamma peptide chain. complete dissociation was observed between biological folate activity and radioactivity of plasma after ingestion of pteroyltriglutamate labeled in the middle glutamate. this indicates  cleavage to the monoglutamate form at the time of absorption from the intestine or very soon thereafter. a large portion of radioactivity liberated from the middle glutamate is recoverable as carbon dioxide in the exhaled air. fecal losses of folate tended to be greater with increasing length of the poly-gamma-glutamyl chain. higher blood levels and greater urinary losses of folate tended to occur after ingestion of mono- and triglutamates than with the heptaglutamate. calculations based on radioactivity determinations in feces plus  urinary folate losses, judged by either radioactivity or microbiological assays,  indicated net retention of 37-67% of the dose irrespective of chain length ingested and major avenue of loss. during the peak of absorption the folate circulating in plasma was active for both streptococcus fecalis and lactobacillus casei and carried specific radioactivity which was virtually identical with that  of the administered dose. this suggests that neither methylation, conjugation, nor displacement of nonradioactive folate occurred to any significant extent during the 1st 2 hr. the specific radioactivity of 24-hr urine specimens as measured with l. casei corresponded closely with that of the administered dose. evidence exists that methylation of the radioactive folate may occur, but significant displacement of nonradioactive methylfolate was not observed under the conditions of this study. since 50-75% of administered heptaglutamate appears to be absorbable in man, estimates of dietary intake should include this fraction as well as the "free" folate.

AB  == this study was undertaken to determine whether leuconostoc citrovorum plays a role in carbon dioxide production in milk. the ability of l. citrovorum strains to produce gas was studied by two methods. a qualitative method, in which an agar plug was forced up the neck of a volumetric flask, measured gas visually. this method demonstrated that 0.25% yeast extract, in a milk medium at 30 c, stimulated the production of at least 10 ml of gas. studies using a gilson differential respirometer revealed that l. citrovorum produced 500 to 900 muliters of co(2) in 6.5 hr, whereas 800 to 1,500 muliters of co(2) was produced  in nonfat milk which contained 0.33% yeast extract. cell extracts of streptococcus cremoris, s. lactis, lactobacillus lactis, l. casei, and l. helveticus also enhanced gas production of l. citrovorum from 20 to 70%. autolysates of these bacteria, present during the ripening or ageing of certain cheeses, may stimulate l. citrovorum, a common organism in starter cultures, to produce gas, causing, for example, the slit-open defect of cheddar cheese. yeast  extract caused an increase in acid and gas production per cell but did not cause  an increase in growth. experiments indicated that one metabolic source of carbon  dioxide was the decarboxylation of pyruvate produced during catabolism of citric  acid. yeast extract stimulated this reaction by 16%.

AB  == mattheis, martha s. (university of kansas, lawrence), m. silverman, and d. paretsky. studies on the physiology of rickettsiae. iv. folic acids of coxiella burnetii. j. bacteriol. 85:37-41. 1963.-yolk, yolk sac, and embryo tissues of uninfected eggs, and those infected with coxiella burnetii, were analyzed for folic acid derivatives by employing diethylaminoethyl (deae)-cellulose column chromatography. infected tissues contained quantitatively less folate, but the elution profiles of both infected and uninfected tissues were identical. purified c. burnetii contained some types of folate apparently unique to these rickettsiae, and not found in infected tissue. the major folate fraction of c. burnetii was partially characterized by (i) elution position from deae columns; (ii) treatment with conjugase; (iii) growth response by lactobacillus casei, streptococcus faecalis r, and pediococcus cerevisiae; and (iv) response to oxidation, reduction, and formylation.

TI  == relationship of a new growth factor required by certain hemolytic streptococci to growth phenomena in other bacteria.
AB  == by a series of quantitative assays of concentrates prepared in a variety of ways, it has been shown that the previously described growth factor now called "strepogenin," required by certain hemolytic streptococci, is very similar to and possibly identical with the recently described growth factors for lactobacillus casei and smith's streptococcus lactis. an improved procedure for assay of strepogenin with the aid of lactobacillus casei has been described, and additional properties of the growth factor have been presented.
