TI  == insights into the mechanism of inhibition of novel bacterial topoisomerase inhibitors (nbtis) from characterization of resistant mutants in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the type ii topoisomerases dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv are clinically validated bacterial targets that catalyze the modulation of dna topology that is  vital to dna replication, repair and decatenation. increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones, that trap the topoisomerase-dna complex, has led to significant efforts in the discovery of novel inhibitors against these targets. az6142 is a member of the class of novel bacterial topoisomerase inhibitors (nbti) that utilizes a distinct mechanism to trap the protein-dna complex. az6142 has very potent activity against gram positive organisms, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes. in this study we determined the frequency of resistance of az6142 and other nbti representative compounds against s. aureus and s. pneumoniae. the frequency of selection of resistant mutants at 4-fold mic was 1.7 x 10-8 for s. aureus and <5.5 x 10-10 for s. pneumoniae. to improve our understanding of the nbti mechanism of inhibition, the s. aureus resistant mutants were characterized and 20 unique mutations in the topoisomerase subunits were identified. many of these mutations were located outside of the nbti-binding pocket and impact the susceptibility of az6142 resulting in a 4-32 fold elevation in mic over the wild type parent strain. cross-resistance data with other nbtis and fluoroquinolones enabled the differentiation of scaffold specific changes from compound specific variations. our results suggest that az6142 inhibits both type ii topoisomerases in s. aureus but that dna gyrase is the primary target. further, the genotype of the resistant mutants suggests that domain conformations and dna-interactions may uniquely impact nbti when compared to fluoroquinolones.

TI  == blood cultures are not useful in the evaluation of children with uncomplicated superficial skin and soft tissue infections.
AB  == background: blood cultures are commonly performed on children admitted to hospital for skin and soft tissue infections (sstis). in recent years this practice has been questioned in patients with uncomplicated sstis because of its  low yield. at the same time, however, an increase in community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (ca-mrsa) infections has been described; its influence on rates of bacteremia in patients with sstis is unclear. the aims of the study were to describe the performance and the yield of  blood culture in immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated sstis and to determine the prevalence of ca-mrsa as a causative agent in our area. methods: retrospective study. immunocompetent patients <18 years evaluated in the emergency department and admitted for uncomplicated sstis (cellulitis, abscess, impetigo or erysipelas) from july 1, 2010 to june 31, 2014 were included. patients referred from other hospitals who are receiving parenteral antibiotics and patients with complicated sstis (surgical or traumatic wound infection, need  for surgical intervention and infected ulcers or burns) were excluded. results: we included 445 cases: 348 (78.2%) cellulitis, 78 (17.5%) abscess, and 19 (4.3%)  impetigo. blood cultures were performed on 353 (79.3%) patients. two (0.6%; 95% ci: 0.2-2.0%) were positive and 10 (2.8%; 95% ci: 1.5-5.1%) contaminated. the positive blood cultures grew s. aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. wound cultures were performed on 148 (33.3%) patients; 98 (66.2%) were positive. in 22 (22.4%) ca-mrsa grew, accounting for 14.9% of overall wound cultures. conclusions: blood  cultures are not useful in the management of immunocompetent patients admitted to the hospital with uncomplicated sstis. the prevalence of ca-mrsa is low in our area, but continuing careful surveillance is needed.

TI  == antibacterial effects of traditional chinese medicine monomers against streptococcus pneumoniae via inhibiting pneumococcal histidine kinase (vick).
AB  == two-component systems (tcss) have the potential to be an effective target of the  antimicrobials, and thus received much attention in recent years. vick/vicr is one of tcss in streptococcus pneumoniae (s. pneumoniae), which is essential for pneumococcal survival. we have previously obtained several traditional chinese medicine monomers using a computer-based screening. in this study, either alone or in combination with penicillin, their antimicrobial activities were evaluated  based on in vivo and in vitro assays. the results showed that the mics of 5'-(methylthio)-5'-deoxyadenosine, octanal 2, 4-dinitrophenylhydrazone, deoxyshikonin, kavahin, and dodecyl gallate against s. pneumoniae were 37.1, 38.5, 17, 68.5, and 21 mug/ml, respectively. time-killing assays showed that these compounds elicited bactericidal effects against s. pneumoniae d39 strain, which led to a 6-log reduction in cfu after exposure to compounds at four times of the mic for 24 h. the five compounds inhibited the growth of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans or streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, meanwhile, deoxyshikonin and dodecyl gallate displayed strong inhibitory activities against staphylococcus aureus. these compounds showed no obvious cytotoxicity effects on vero cells. survival time of the mice infected by s. pneumoniae strains was prolonged by the treatment with the compounds. importantly, all of the five compounds exerted antimicrobial effects against multidrug-resistant clinical strains of s. pneumoniae. moreover, even at sub-mic  concentration, they inhibited cell division and biofilm formation. the five compounds all have enhancement effect on penicillin. deoxyshikonin and dodecyl gallate showed significantly synergic antimicrobial activity with penicillin in vivo and in vitro, and effectively reduced nasopharyngeal and lung colonization caused by different penicillin-resistant pneumococcal serotypes. in addition, the two compounds also showed synergic antimicrobial activity with erythromycin and tetracycline. taken together, our results suggest that these novel vick inhibitors may be promising compounds against the pneumococcus, including penicillin-resistant strains.

TI  == impact of antibiotic pretreatment on bone biopsy yield for children with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis.
AB  == objective: pediatric acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (aho) is a relatively common reason for hospitalization, but many variables require additional study, including the impact of antibiotic treatment on bone biopsy culture yield. methods: this was a retrospective study of children 60 days to 18 years old with  aho seen from 2011 to 2012 in whom bone biopsy cultures were obtained. results: a total of 67 children had biopsies; median age was 7 years; 40 were pretreated with antibiotics. microbiologic confirmation was obtained for 72%: in 34%, both blood and bone cultures were positive; in 33%, bone cultures alone were positive; and 4% had only positive blood cultures. there was no difference in bone biopsy cultures for children who did and did not receive antibiotics before biopsy (28/40 [70%] vs 17/27 [63%], odds ratio 1.37, 95% confidence interval 0.49-3.86). for pretreated patients, the mean duration of therapy was longer in children with negative cultures (79 vs 40 hours, p = .04). bacteremia was seen in 26 (39%), and was more common in antibiotic-pretreated children (55% vs 15%, odds ratio 7, 95%  confidence interval 2.1-24.1). among the 41 nonbacteremic children, bone cultures provided the only microbiologic diagnosis for 22 (54%): 20 staphylococcus aureus, 2 streptococcus pyogenes. conclusions: in conclusion, although bone biopsy results were not affected by previous antibiotic administration, a longer duration of antibiotic therapy before bone biopsy was associated with lower culture yield. in one-third of children, only the bone biopsy resulted in an organism being isolated. as it may take longer to sterilize bone than blood, a bone biopsy/culture should be considered a crucial part of the aho evaluation to  increase diagnostic yield.

TI  == antimicrobial efficacy of ten commercially available herbal dentifrices against specific oral microflora - in vitro study.
AB  == aim: to determine and compare the antimicrobial efficacy of ten commercially available herbal dentifrices against specific strains of oral microflora using a  standard diffusion method at full strength and 1:1 dilution at 24 h. materials and methods: the standard strains of streptococcus. mutans (atcc 21293), streptococcus sangius (mtcc 442), actinomyces viscosus (atcc 3268), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 2592), streptococcus pyogenes (mtcc 442) and candida  albicans (atcc 183) were obtained. antimicrobial efficacy of the dentifrices was  tested in triplicate, at full strength and 1:1 dilution with the sterile water using a standard diffusion method for 24 h at 37 degrees c. the antimicrobial efficacy was tested by observing the zones of inhibition in millimeters surrounding disk containing the dentifrice. mean standard deviation and standard  error of mean of the inhibitory zones was calculated for each herbal dentifrice.  p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. results: danth kanthi (dk) was the most effective against all the microorganisms producing larger zones of inhibition at 24 h (f.s - 40+/-1.5; 1:1 dilution - 40+/-2.71). amar premium (ap)  also produced larger zones of inhibition against all microorganisms except s. aureus. of all the dentifrices, least zones of inhibitions i.e., around 5 mm was  observed against s. aureus by amar premium (ap) and dabur babool (db) at 24 h. conclusion: based on the results of the present study, it can be concluded that all herbal dentifrices exhibited antimicrobial activity against the selected oral microorganisms, with dk being the most effective. hence, it can be inferred that  herbal dentifrices can also be recommended like the conventional formulations.

TI  == frequency of spontaneous resistance to peptide deformylase inhibitor gsk1322322 in haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == the continuous emergence of multidrug resistant pathogenic bacteria is compromising the successful treatment of serious microbial infections. gsk1322322, a novel peptide deformylase (pdf) inhibitor, shows good in vitro antibacterial activity and has demonstrated safety and efficacy in human proof-of-concept clinical studies. in vitro studies were performed to determine the frequency of resistance (for) to this antimicrobial agent in major pathogens  causing respiratory tract and skin infections. resistance to gsk1322322 occurred  at high frequency through loss-of-function mutations in the formyl-methionyl transferase (fmt) protein in staphylococcus aureus (4/4 strains) and streptococcus pyogenes (4/4 strains), and via missense mutations in streptococcus pneumoniae (6/21 strains), but these mutations are associated with a severe in vitro and/or in vivo fitness cost. the overall for to gsk1322322 was very low in  haemophilus influenzae with only one pdf mutant identified in one of four strains. no target-based mutants were identified from s. pyogenes, and only one or no pdf mutants were isolated in three of the four s. aureus strains studied. in s. pneumoniae, pdf mutants were only isolated from six of 21 strains tested and an additional 10 strains did not yield colonies on gsk1322322-containing plates. most of the pdf mutants characterized from these three organisms (35/37), carried mutations in residues at or in close proximity to one of three highly conserved motifs, which are part of the active site of the pdf protein, with 30 of the 35 mutations occurring at position v71 (s. pneumoniae numbering system).

TI  == nationwide surveillance of 6 otorhinolaryngological infectious diseases and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in the isolated pathogens in japan.
AB  == the japanese three academic societies joint antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance committee has conducted a nationwide surveillance on antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and rates of isolation in 6 otolaryngological diseases. the surveillance program was conducted in the otorhinolaryngological departments  of 29 universities, and their 26 affiliated hospitals. patients suffering from acute otitis media, chronic otitis media, acute nasal sinusitis, chronic nasal sinusitis, acute tonsillitis, and peritonsillar abscess between january 2011 and  june 2012 were investigated. the collected swab or incision samples were cultivated for microbial identification, and the drug susceptibility of detected  bacteria was measured at the kitasato university research center for infections and antimicrobials. the surveillance focused on three gram-positive bacteria (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus), three gram-negative bacteria (haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and  pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three anaerobic bacteria (peptostreptococcus spp., prevotella spp., and fusobacterium spp.). bacterial susceptibility to 39 antimicrobial drugs was investigated. we compared bacterial isolation ratio of each disease in this surveillance from those of past 4 times surveillance which we performed formerly, and we also compared percentage of main drug resistant strains from those of past 4 times surveillance. the age composition between this time and former surveillances was not statistically significant by student-t test. we were unable to completely resolve the rise in resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant s. aureus, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase non-producing ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae, beta-lactamase producing ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae, and beta-lactamase producing amoxicillin clavulanic acid-resistant h. influenzae. we suggest promoting the proper usage of antimicrobial drugs in order to avoid the spread of these bacteria.

TI  == antibacterial activity of native california medicinal plant extracts isolated from rhamnus californica and umbellularia californica.
AB  == background: antimicrobial resistance (amr) is a major threat to global public health. medicinal plants have long been used as remedies for infectious diseases  by native cultures around the world and have the potential for providing effective treatments for antibiotic-resistant infections. rhamnus californica (rhamnaceae) and umbellularia californica (lauraceae) are two indigenous california plant species historically used by native americans to treat skin, respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. this study aimed to assess the in vitro antimicrobial activity of methanolic extracts of leaves and bark of r. and  u. californica against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. methods: methanolic extracts of leaves and bark of r. and u. californica were prepared by soxhlet extraction and  evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against bacillus cereus, streptococcus pyogenes, mycobacterium smegmatis, staphylococcus aureus, mrsa, escherichia coli  and pseudomonas aeruginosa using disc diffusion and minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) assays. chemical profiling of the extracts was performed using standard methods. results: all extracts inhibited the growth of mrsa and other gram-positive bacteria with mics of 3.3-6.0 mg/ml. gram-negative organisms  were unaffected by these extracts. u. californica extracts (leaves and bark) had  the lowest mic values. chemical profiling detected the presence of quinones, alkaloids, flavonoids, cardenolides, tannins and saponins in these extracts. our  study is the first to report the antimicrobial properties of r. and u. californica and illustrates their promising anti-mrsa potential. conclusions: our results give scientific credence to the traditional medicinal uses of these plants by the indigenous peoples of california. further investigation of the secondary metabolites responsible for the antimicrobial activity of these extracts against mrsa is warranted.

TI  == discrepancy in maldi-tof ms identification of uncommon gram-negative bacteria from lower respiratory secretions in patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == introduction: early identification of microbial organisms from respiratory secretions of patients with cystic fibrosis (cf) is important to guide therapeutic decisions. the objective was to compare the accuracy of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) relative to the conventional phenotypic method in identifying common bacterial isolates, including nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria, in a cohort of patients with cf. methods: a total of 123 isolates from 50 patients with cf representing 14 bacterial species from respiratory specimens were identified using maldi-tof ms in parallel with conventional phenotypic methods. discrepancies were confirmed by 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene sequencing in five  gram-negative isolates. results: the maldi-tof ms managed to identify 122/123 (99.2%) bacterial isolates to the genus level and 118/123 (95.9%) were identified to the species level. the maldi-tof ms results were 100% consistent to the species level with conventional phenotypic identification for isolates of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes, achromobacter xylosoxidans, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and other uncommon organisms such as chryseobacterium gleum and enterobacter cloacae. the 5/123 (4.6%) isolates misidentified were all gram-negative bacteria. the isolation of e. cloacae and haemophilus paraphrohaemolyticus may extend the potentially pathogenic list of organisms isolated from patients with cf. conclusion: although the technique provides an early identification and antimicrobial therapy approach in patients with cf, limitation in the diagnosis of uncommon gram-negative bacteria may exist.

TI  == a derivative of the thiopeptide ge2270a highly selective against propionibacterium acnes.
AB  == a chemical derivative of the thiopeptide ge2270a, designated nai003, was found to possess a substantially reduced antibacterial spectrum in comparison to the parent compound, being active against just a few gram-positive bacteria. in particular, nai003 retained low mics against all tested isolates of propionibacterium acnes and, to a lesser extent, against enterococcus faecalis. furthermore, nai003 showed a time- and dose-dependent killing of both a clindamycin-resistant and a clindamycin-sensitive p. acnes isolate. gel-shift experiments indicated that, like the parent compound, nai003 retained the ability to bind to elongation factors (ef) tu derived from escherichia coli, e. faecalis  or p. acnes, albeit with reduced efficiency. in contrast, ef-tu's derived from the nai003-insenstitive staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes did not bind this compound. these results were confirmed by in vitro studies using a hybrid translation system, which indicated that nai003 can inhibit most efficiently protein synthesis driven by the p. acnes ef-tu. p. acnes mutants resistant to nai003 were isolated by direct plating. with one exception, all analyzed strains carried mutation in the tuf gene, encoding ef-tu. because of its selective effect on p. acnes in comparison to resident skin flora, nai003 represents a promising candidate for the topical treatment of acne, which has already completed a phase 1 clinical study.

TI  == decade-long use of the antimicrobial peptide combination tyrothricin does not pose a major risk of acquired resistance with gram-positive bacteria and candida  spp.
AB  == tyrothricin, an antimicrobial peptide combination produced by bacillus brevis consisting of gramicidins and tyrocidins commands broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria and some yeasts in vitro. the polypeptide and its  components have been used therapeutically for about 60 years in the local treatment of infected skin and infected oro-pharyngeal mucous membranes. though older studies suggest that resistance development of originally susceptible microorganisms towards tyrothricin is a rare event, data concerning recent state  of resistance are lacking. in the present in vitro study the susceptibility to tyrothricin of clinical isolates of bacterial and yeast origin from superficial swabs of the skin and mucous membranes of outpatients and inpatients obtained from clinical material in the second half of the year 2003 was determined. using  a microdilution assay, the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic and mic90, defined as the concentration that inhibits at least 90 percent of the tested strains) of 20 strains each of staphylococcus aureus of the variety mssa (susceptible to methicillin), staphylococcus aureus of the variety mrsa (methicillin resistant), staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, corynebacterium spec., candida albicans and candida parapsilosis was determined. all of the tested gram-positive bacteria turned out  to be highly susceptible to tyrothricin with mics </= 4mg/l. the tested yeast strains were susceptible to the polypeptide antibiotic as well, but (with mics of 16 mg/l and 32 mg/l, respectively) to a lesser extent. no acquired resistance of  the tested strains was determined, indicating that the risk of resistance development against topically applied tyrothricin is only marginal, if there is any at all. thus, long-term-, i.e. decade-long use of topically applied tyrothricin and its components in the local treatment of infected skin does not pose a major risk with respect to acquired resistance of originally susceptible gram-positive bacteria and yeasts, not even in the case of staphylococcus aureus, both with mssa and mrsa strains. the broad anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activity of tyrothricin combined with its lacking risk for resistance development make the antimicrobial peptide a valuable addition to our therapeutic armamentarium in the treatment of infected skin.

TI  == pathogenic bacterial nasopharyngeal colonization and its impact on respiratory diseases in the first year of life: the patch birth cohort study.
AB  == background: for acute respiratory diseases caused by bacteria, colonization in the respiratory tracts is often the first sign, although nasopharynx is the major source of secretions containing pathogens. to understand the pathogenesis of respiratory tract diseases, it is important to analyze the establishment of nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization. methods: infants with nasopharyngeal swabs were examined at the age of 1, 2, 4, 6 and 12 months for the detection of pathogens, including streptococcus pneumoniae, hemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus. the methods used for detection were bacterial culture and multiplex polymerase chain reaction. results: from january 2012 to august 2013, a total of 320 neonates were enrolled, and 120 of them completed the first 12-month study. staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen at all 5 time points while the rates declined; in contrast,  the other 4 increased during the first year of life. of our series, the multiplex polymerase chain reaction detection rates were higher than those of bacterial culture. more than 50% of staphylococcus aureus was methicillin-resistant, and the trend decreased in the same period. in the analysis of factors associated with the development of infant wheeze, infants with maternal atopy [odds ratio (or): 3.26; 95% confidence interval (ci): 1.20-8.88; p = 0.02] and pneumococcal colonization (or: 15.64; 95% ci: 3.25-75.35; p = 0.001) had higher rates of wheeze. conclusions: bacterial interactions may result in differing pathogen prevalence in the first year of life. in addition, nasopharyngeal pneumococcal colonization may have an effect on the risk of infant wheeze. the result could help clinicians to clarify the relation between bacterial colonization and respiratory illnesses in infancy.

TI  == development of gendine coated cannula for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion for extended use.
AB  == continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (csii) using pumps is a widely used method for insulin therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus. one of the major factors that usually lead to the discontinuation of csii is csii set related issues including infection at the infusion site. current american diabetic association recommends rotating sites every 2-3 days. this adds cost and creates  inconvenience. therefore, in order to prevent infections and extend durations between insertion site changes, we have developed a teflon cannula coated with the combination of gentian violet and chlorhexidine (gendine) and tested its antimicrobial efficacy against different pathogens. cannulas were coated with gendine on exterior surface and dried. efficacy and durability of gendine cannulas was determined against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin- susceptible staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and candida glabrata using biofilm colonization method. cytotoxicity of gendine was assessed against mouse fibroblast cell lines. gendine cannulas showed complete prevention of biofilm colonization of all organisms tested up to 2 weeks (p < 0.0001) compared to uncoated control. gendine catheter against mouse fibroblast cells shown to be non-cytotoxic. our in vitro results show that a novel gendine cannula is highly effective in completely inhibiting biofilm of multi-drug resistant pathogens for  up to 2 weeks and may have potential clinical applications such as prolonged use, cost reduction and decreased infection rate.

TI  == bacterial and respiratory viral interactions in the etiology of acute otitis media in hiv-infected and hiv-uninfected south african children.
AB  == background: bacteria and respiratory viruses are implicated in the pathogenesis of acute otitis media (aom); however, data from low-middle income countries are sparse. we investigated the etiology of aom in hiv-infected (hiv+), hiv-uninfected (hiv-) and hiv-exposed clinically asymptomatic for hiv-infection (heu) south african children. methods: children >/=3 months to <5 years of age with aom were enrolled between may 2009 and april 2010 (nct01031082). middle ear  fluid samples were cultured for bacteria; antibacterial susceptibility was done and serotyping undertaken for streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed for respiratory viruses using  immunofluorescence assay and polymerase chain reaction. results: of 260 aom episodes (hiv+:15; hiv-:182; heu:63), bacteria were found in 54.6%, including haemophilus influenzae (30.8%), 98.8% of which were nontypeable, and streptococcus pneumoniae (20.4%), staphylococcus aureus (15.8%), moraxella catarrhalis (5.0%) and streptococcus pyogenes (1.5%). nonsusceptibility of streptococcus pneumoniae to penicillin was 64.2%. respiratory viruses were detected in 74.2% of cases. human rhinovirus was most frequently detected (37.7%), followed by adenovirus (14.2%) and human bocavirus (11.5%) overall and irrespective of hiv status. respiratory viruses were identified concurrently with s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis (76.9-78.8%) and staphylococcus aureus (63.4%) cultured from middle ear fluid, as well as in 72.0% of episodes negative for any bacteria. conclusion: the study suggests that respiratory viruses and pathogenic bacteria play an important role in the development of aom  in children. a similar spectrum of pathogens was observed independently of hiv status. vaccines targeting both nontypeable haemophilus influenzae and s. pneumoniae may have a broad impact on aom in south africa.

TI  == in vivo genome editing using staphylococcus aureus cas9.
AB  == the rna-guided endonuclease cas9 has emerged as a versatile genome-editing platform. however, the size of the commonly used cas9 from streptococcus pyogenes (spcas9) limits its utility for basic research and therapeutic applications that  use the highly versatile adeno-associated virus (aav) delivery vehicle. here, we  characterize six smaller cas9 orthologues and show that cas9 from staphylococcus  aureus (sacas9) can edit the genome with efficiencies similar to those of spcas9, while being more than 1 kilobase shorter. we packaged sacas9 and its single guide rna expression cassette into a single aav vector and targeted the cholesterol regulatory gene pcsk9 in the mouse liver. within one week of injection, we observed >40% gene modification, accompanied by significant reductions in serum pcsk9 and total cholesterol levels. we further assess the genome-wide targeting specificity of sacas9 and spcas9 using bless, and demonstrate that sacas9-mediated in vivo genome editing has the potential to be efficient and specific.

TI  == site-specific immobilization of protein layers on gold surfaces via orthogonal sortases.
AB  == we report a site-specific, sortase-mediated ligation to immobilize proteins layer-by-layer on a gold surface. recombinant fluorescent proteins with a sortase a recognition tag at the c-terminus were immobilized on peptide-modified gold surfaces. we used two sortases with different substrate specificities (streptococcus pyogenes sortase a and staphylococcus aureus sortase a) to immobilize layers of gfp and mcherry site-specifically on the gold surface. surfaces were characterized using fluorescence and atomic force microscopy after  immobilizing each layer of protein. fluorescent micrographs showed that both protein immobilization on the modified gold surface and protein oligomerization are sortase-dependent. afm images showed that either homogenous protein monolayers or layers of protein oligomers can be generated using appropriately tagged substrate proteins. using sortase a variants with orthogonal peptide substrate specificities, site-specific immobilization of appropriately tagged gfp onto a layer of immobilized mcherry was achieved without disruption of the underlying protein layer.

TI  == development and laboratory evaluation of a real-time pcr assay for detecting viruses and bacteria of relevance for community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == community-acquired pneumonia may present with similar clinical symptoms, regardless of viral or bacterial cause. diagnostic assays are needed to rapidly discriminate between causes, because this will guide decisions on appropriate treatment. therefore, a quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) assay with duplex reactions targeting eight bacteria and six viruses was developed. technical performance was examined with linear plasmids. upper and lower respiratory tract  specimens were used to compare the qpcr assay with standard microbiological methods. the limit of detection was 5 to 20 dna template copies with approximately 1000-fold differences in concentrations of the two competing templates. sds for positive controls were <5%. the use of the qpcr assay resulted in 113 positive identifications in 94 respiratory specimens compared with 38 by using standard diagnostics. diagnostic accuracy of the qpcr assay varied between  60% positive agreement with standard tests for streptococcus pneumoniae and 100%  for mycoplasma pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and staphylococcus aureus. negative percentage of agreement was >95% for m. pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza a virus; whereas it was only 56% for haemophilus influenzae. multiple microbial agents were identified in 19 of 44 sputum and 19 of 50 nasopharynx specimens. we conclude that in parallel qpcr detection of the targeted respiratory bacteria and viruses is feasible. the  results indicate good technical performance of the assay in clinical specimens.

AB  == skin infections are a common cause for dermatological consultations in the paediatric setting. a review is presented of the clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of the main bacterial skin infections, as well as the diagnosis and treatment of super-infected puncture and bite wounds. the most prevalent bacteria in skin infections are staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. treatment is usually empirical, since microbiological studies are only  recommended under certain circumstances or lack of improvement with common therapies. superficial skin infections can be treated with local antiseptics or antibiotics (mupirocin or fusidic acid). systemic treatment is usually reserved for patients with extensive or severe disease or with other risk factors. systemic treatment depends on the suspected infecting bacteria, with penicillin,  amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and first or second generation cephalosporin being the most frequently used drugs. due to the low incidence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant infection by s. aureus in spain, the use of clindamycin or co-trimoxazole is only recommended after severe disease, relapses or a clear epidemiological background.

TI  == surrogate analysis of vancomycin to predict susceptible categorization of dalbavancin.
AB  == dalbavancin (dal) represents a recently approved addition for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssis). newly released antimicrobial agents are rarely found on commercial susceptibility testing devices, and surrogate testing may be an option for clinical microbiology laboratories. a total of 33,688 staphylococcus aureus, 2800 viridans group streptococci (vgs), and 5722 beta-hemolytic streptococci (bhs) were included in this cross-susceptibility (dal versus vancomycin [van]) analysis as well as 4576  coagulase-negative staphylococci and 6515 enterococci (nonindicated species groups). isolates were collected as part of the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program for the united states (usa) and europe (2011-2013). susceptibility testing followed clsi (m07-a9 and m100-s24) methods. usa food and drug administration (dal) and clsi (van) breakpoint criteria were used for correlations between dal and van susceptibility results. a categorical agreement  (ca; susceptible) rate of 99.9% was observed between dal and van when testing s.  aureus. only 48 (0.14%) very major (false-susceptible) errors were noted against  van-susceptible isolates that displayed a dal-nonsusceptible (mic, 0.25 or 0.5mug/ml) phenotype. when susceptible mic correlations were analyzed against indicated bhs species (streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pyogenes), an overall ca rate of 97.7-100.0% was obtained. complete (100.0%) ca was documented  for s. pyogenes, as well as against all vgs isolates, including the indicated streptococcus anginosus group (758 strains). in conclusion, high susceptible ca rates between dal and van were observed when testing a contemporary collection of indicated clinical isolates found in absssi. van-susceptible isolates can be inferred to be inhibited by dal (97.7-100.0%) at the regulatory agency-approved susceptible interpretive breakpoint of </=0.12mug/ml.

TI  == reduction of lactobacillus in the milks of cows with subclinical mastitis.
AB  == clinical and subclinical bovine mastitis are the most frequent diseases encountered on dairy farms worldwide, which cause significant economic loss and veterinary cost. the mastitic disease status is associated with increases in both milk bacterial pathogens and somatic cell count (scc). although it is well established that the mastitic pathogens generally correlate with the milk scc, to our knowledge, the correlation between the probiotic genus, lactobacillus, and the mastitic causative bacteria and scc have not been determined previously. thus, in this study, milk samples from 12 mild and 28 severe subclinical mastitic dairy cows were collected from the same farm. the overall milk bacterial load was quantified with the total plate count method. the lactobacillus genus and 4 common clinical and subclinical mastitic pathogens (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, and trueperella pyogenes) in the sampled milk were enumerated by quantitative pcr. mild and severe subclinical mastitic samples were distinctly separated on the principal component analysis score plot generated based on the quantities of these 5 target bacteria, suggesting that clear differences existed in the microbiological composition between the two sample groups. based on comparison with the pairwise mann-whitney test, the mild subclinical mastitic dairy cows had a significantly higher amounts of lactobacilli (p=0.0175), but lower e. coli (p=0.0002), s. aureus (p<0.0001), s. agalactiae (p=0.0001) and t. pyogenes (p=0.0044) quantities, while an opposite trend occurred in the severe subclinical mastitic group. the negative correlation between lactobacillus and the pathogenic bacteria, as well as the scc, was confirmed with spearman correlation analysis. data generated from the current study may hint to a close relationship between lactobacillus and the health of bovine udder.

TI  == cas9 specifies functional viral targets during crispr-cas adaptation.
AB  == clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (crispr) loci and their  associated (cas) proteins provide adaptive immunity against viral infection in prokaryotes. upon infection, short phage sequences known as spacers integrate between crispr repeats and are transcribed into small rna molecules that guide the cas9 nuclease to the viral targets (protospacers). streptococcus pyogenes cas9 cleavage of the viral genome requires the presence of a 5'-ngg-3' protospacer adjacent motif (pam) sequence immediately downstream of the viral target. it is not known whether and how viral sequences flanked by the correct pam are chosen as new spacers. here we show that cas9 selects functional spacers  by recognizing their pam during spacer acquisition. the replacement of cas9 with  alleles that lack the pam recognition motif or recognize an nggng pam eliminated  or changed pam specificity during spacer acquisition, respectively. cas9 associates with other proteins of the acquisition machinery (cas1, cas2 and csn2), presumably to provide pam-specificity to this process. these results establish a new function for cas9 in the genesis of prokaryotic immunological memory.

TI  == fabric-skin models to assess infection transfer for impetigo contagiosa in a kindergarten scenario.
AB  == children in community bodies like kindergartens are predisposed to suffer from impetigo. to consider important measures for infection prevention, direct and indirect transmission routes of pathogens must be revealed. therefore, we studied the role of skin and fabrics in the spread of the impetigo pathogen staphylococcus aureus and the strain streptococcus equi (surrogate to streptococcus pyogenes) in order to assess infection transfer in realistic scenarios. the transmission of test strains was studied with standardized fabric-skin models using a technical artificial skin and fabrics of different fiber types commonly occurring in german kindergartens. in synthetic pus, both test strains persisted on artificial skin and fabrics for at least 4 h. friction  enhanced transfer, depending on the fiber type or fabric construction. in a skin-to-skin setup, the total transfer was higher than via fabrics and no decrease in the transmission rates from donor to recipients could be observed after successive direct skin contacts. children in kindergartens may be at risk of transmission for impetigo pathogens, especially via direct skin contact, but also by the joint use of fabrics, like towels or handicraft materials. fabric-skin models used in this study enable further insight into the transmission factors for skin infections on the basis of a practical approach.

TI  == the microbiology of impetigo in indigenous children: associations between streptococcus pyogenes , staphylococcus aureus, scabies, and nasal carriage.
AB  == backgroundimpetigo is caused by both streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus; the relative contributions of each have been reported to fluctuate with time and region. while s. aureus is reportedly on the increase in most industrialised settings, s. pyogenes is still thought to drive impetigo in endemic, tropical regions. however, few studies have utilised high quality microbiological culture methods to confirm this assumption. we report the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of impetigo pathogens recovered in a randomised, controlled trial of impetigo treatment conducted in remote indigenous communities of northern australia.resultsfrom 508 children, we collected 872 swabs of sores and 504 swabs from the anterior nares prior to commencement of antibiotic therapy. s. pyogenes and s. aureus were identified together in 503/872 (58%) of sores; with an additional 207/872 (24%) sores having s. pyogenes and 81/872 (9%) s. aureus, in isolation. skin sore swabs taken during episodes with a concurrent diagnosis of scabies were more likely to culture s. pyogenes (or 2.2,  95% ci 1.1 inverted question mark 4.4, p inverted question mark= inverted question mark0.03). eighteen percent of children had nasal carriage of skin pathogens. there was no association between the presence of s. aureus in the nose and skin. methicillin-resistance was detected in 15% of children who cultured s.  aureus from either a sore or their nose. there was no association found between the severity of impetigo and the detection of a skin pathogen.conclusions s. pyogenes remains the principal pathogen in tropical impetigo; the relatively high contribution of s. aureus as a co-pathogen has also been confirmed. children with scabies were more likely to have s. pyogenes detected. while clearance of s. pyogenes is the key determinant of treatment efficacy, co-infection with s. aureus warrants consideration of treatment options that are effective against both pathogens where impetigo is severe and prevalent.trial registrationthis trial is registered; actrn12609000858291.

AB  == the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils isolated from twigs with needles (t+n) and from twigs without needles (t-n) from  wild pinus peuce griseb. (pinaceae), from three different locations in r. macedonia, were investigated. essential oil yields of t+n ranged from 7.5 ml/kg to 12.5 ml/kg and for t-n from 13.8 ml/kg to 17.3 ml/kg. gc/fid/ms analysis of the essential oils revealed eighty-four components, representing 93.7-95.7% and 91.2-92.0% of the t+n and t-n oils, respectively. the major components in t+n and t-n oils were monoterpenes: alpha-pinene (23.8-39.9%, 21.2-23.3%), camphene (2.2-5.5%, 0.7-2.0%), beta-pinene (10.1-17.1%, 8.2-16.4%), myrcene (1.2-1.41%, 1.6-2.5%), limonene+beta-phellandrene (6.8-14.0%, 8.8-23.6%) and bornyl acetate (2.3-6.9%, 1.1-3.4%), followed by the sesquiterpenes: trans-(e)-caryophyllene (3.6-4.3%, 3.2-7.3%), germacrene d (7.1-9.5%, 5.0-10.3%) and delta-cadinene (2.1-3.1%, 3.3-4.2%, respectively). antimicrobial screening of the essential oils was made by disk diffusion and broth dilution methods against 13 bacterial isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and one strain of candida albicans. t-n essential oils showed antimicrobial activity toward streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and candida albicans as well as streptococcus agalactiae, acinetobacter spp. and haemophilus influenzae. the antimicrobial activity of t+n essential oils was greater, especially against streptococcus agalactiae, s. pyogenes, enterococcus and candida albicans, followed by haemophilus influenzae, acinetobacter spp., escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of all tested essential oils ranged from 15-125  mul/ml. summarizing the obtained results, the antimicrobial activity of pinus peuce t+n and t-n essential oils collected from different localities in r. macedonia varied considerably. these alterations in the antimicrobial activity can be attributed to the differences in the quantitative composition and percentage amounts of the components present in the respective essential oils, although it was evident that there were no differences in the qualitative composition of the essential oils, regardless of the locality of collection, or the type of plant material (t+n or t-n).

TI  == synthesis and structure-activity relationship of amidine derivatives of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene as novel antibacterial agents.
AB  == current antibacterial chemotherapeutics are facing an alarming increase in bacterial resistance pressuring the search for novel agents that would expand the available therapeutic arsenal against resistant bacterial pathogens. in line with these efforts, a series of 9 amidine derivatives of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene were synthesized and, together with 18 previously synthesized analogs, evaluated  for their relative dna binding affinity, in vitro antibacterial activities and preliminary in vitro safety profile. encouraging antibacterial activity of several subclasses of tested amidine derivatives against gram-positive (including resistant mrsa, mrse, vre strains) and gram-negative bacterial strains was observed. the bis-phenyl derivatives were the most antibacterially active, while  compound 19 from bis-benzimidazole class exhibited the widest spectrum of activity (with mic of 4, 2, 0.5 and </=0.25 mug/ml against laboratory strains of  staphyloccocus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, moraxella catarrhalis, respectively and 4-32 mug/ml against clinical isolates of  sensitive and resistant s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecium) and also demonstrated the strongest dna binding affinity (deltatm of 15.4 degrees c). asymmetrically designed compounds and carboxamide-amidines were, in general, less active. molecular docking indicated that the shape of the 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene derivatives and their ability to form multiple electrostatic and hydrogen bonds with dna, corresponds to the binding modes of other minor-groove binders. herein reported results encourage further investigation of this class of compounds as novel antibacterial dna binding agents.

TI  == the crimson conundrum: heme toxicity and tolerance in gas.
AB  == the massive erythrocyte lysis caused by the group a streptococcus (gas) suggests  that the beta-hemolytic pathogen is likely to encounter free heme during the course of infection. in this study, we investigated gas mechanisms for heme sensing and tolerance. we compared the minimal inhibitory concentration of heme among several isolates and established that excess heme is bacteriostatic and exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of heme resulted in noticeable damage to membrane lipids and proteins. pre-exposure of the bacteria to 0.1 mum heme shortened the extended lag period that is otherwise observed when naive cells are inoculated into heme-containing medium, implying that gas is able to adapt. the global response to heme exposure was determined using microarray analysis revealing a significant transcriptome shift that included 79 up regulated and 84  down regulated genes. among other changes, the induction of stress-related chaperones and proteases, including groel/es (8x), the stress regulators spxa2 (5x) and ctsr (3x), as well as redox active enzymes were prominent. the heme stimulon also encompassed a number of regulatory proteins and two-component systems that are important for virulence. a three-gene cluster that is homologous to the pefrcd system of the group b streptococcus was also induced by heme. pefr, a marr-like regulator, specifically binds heme with stoichiometry of 1:2 and protoporphyrin ix (ppix) with stoichiometry of 1:1, implicating it is one of the  gas mediators to heme response. in summary, here we provide evidence that heme induces a broad stress response in gas, and that its success as a pathogen relies on mechanisms for heme sensing, detoxification, and repair.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of azd0914, a new spiropyrimidinetrione dna gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent activity against gram-positive, fastidious gram-negative, and atypical bacteria.
AB  == azd0914 is a new spiropyrimidinetrione bacterial dna gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent in vitro antibacterial activity against key gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus agalactiae), fastidious gram-negative (haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae), atypical (legionella pneumophila), and anaerobic (clostridium difficile) bacterial species, including  isolates with known resistance to fluoroquinolones. azd0914 works via inhibition  of dna biosynthesis and accumulation of double-strand cleavages; this mechanism of inhibition differs from those of other marketed antibacterial compounds. azd0914 stabilizes and arrests the cleaved covalent complex of gyrase with double-strand broken dna under permissive conditions and thus blocks religation of the double-strand cleaved dna to form fused circular dna. whereas this mechanism is similar to that seen with fluoroquinolones, it is mechanistically distinct. azd0914 exhibited low frequencies of spontaneous resistance in s. aureus, and if mutants were obtained, the mutations mapped to gyrb. additionally, no cross-resistance was observed for azd0914 against recent bacterial clinical isolates demonstrating resistance to fluoroquinolones or other drug classes, including macrolides, beta-lactams, glycopeptides, and oxazolidinones. azd0914 was bactericidal in both minimum bactericidal concentration and in vitro time-kill studies. in in vitro checkerboard/synergy testing with 17 comparator antibacterials, only additivity/indifference was observed. the potent in vitro antibacterial activity (including activity against fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates), low frequency of resistance, lack of cross-resistance, and bactericidal activity of azd0914 support its continued development.

TI  == bacteriocin protein bacl1 of enterococcus faecalis targets cell division loci and specifically recognizes l-ala2-cross-bridged peptidoglycan.
AB  == bacteriocin 41 (bac41) is produced from clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis and consists of two extracellular proteins, bacl1 and baca. we previously reported that bacl1 protein (595 amino acids, 64.5 kda) is a bacteriolytic peptidoglycan d-isoglutamyl-l-lysine endopeptidase that induces cell lysis of e. faecalis when an accessory factor, baca, is copresent. however,  the target of bacl1 remains unknown. in this study, we investigated the targeting specificity of bacl1. fluorescence microscopy analysis using fluorescent dye-conjugated recombinant protein demonstrated that bacl1 specifically localized at the cell division-associated site, including the equatorial ring, division septum, and nascent cell wall, on the cell surface of target e. faecalis cells. this specific targeting was dependent on the triple repeat of the sh3 domain located in the region from amino acid 329 to 590 of bacl1. repression of cell growth due to the stationary state of the growth phase or to treatment with bacteriostatic antibiotics rescued bacteria from the bacteriolytic activity of bacl1 and baca. the static growth state also abolished the binding and targeting  of bacl1 to the cell division-associated site. furthermore, the targeting of bacl1 was detectable among gram-positive bacteria with an l-ala-l-ala-cross-bridging peptidoglycan, including e. faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, or streptococcus pneumoniae, but not among bacteria with alternate peptidoglycan structures, such as enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, staphylococcus aureus, or listeria monocytogenes. these data suggest that bacl1 specifically targets the l-ala-l-ala-cross-bridged peptidoglycan and potentially  lyses the e. faecalis cells during cell division.

TI  == managing cervical lymphadenitis--a total pain in the neck!
AB  == patients presenting with cervical lymphadenitis are a complex and common occurrence in a general pediatric practice. although staphylococcus aureus (often methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa]) and streptococcus pyogenes predominate as causative pathogens, the next most common pathogens, bartonella, atypical mycobacterium, and mononucleosis, also must be considered early on. the best way  to diagnose and manage these cases initially is to proceed methodically, with detailed history and physical examination, initial streptococcal mono rapid tests, serial office visits, and complete blood counts. in nonviral cases, an empiric oral antibiotic trial is usually prescribed as early as possible to cover for mrsa or bartonella. very tender or reddened lymph nodes larger than 5 cm that are unresponsive and worsening may likely require inpatient parenteral antibiotics and sometimes surgical removal. the practitioner must also realize that submandibular and supraclavicular node locations are highly suggestive of atypical mycombacterium and cancer, respectively.

TI  == sputum bacteriology and antibiotic sensitivity patterns of community-acquired pneumonia in hospitalized adult patients in nigeria: a 5-year multicentre retrospective study.
AB  == background: a clear knowledge of the pathogens responsible for community-acquired pneumonia (cap) in a given region and their antibiotic sensitivity patterns is necessary for optimal treatment. we determined the common bacterial pathogens causing cap in nigeria and further reviewed their antibiotic senstivity patterns  with a view to providing recommendations to improve antibiotic management of cap. methods: case notes of all adult patients who were 18 years or more admitted to four major tertiary hospitals in south east nigeria with a diagnosis of cap between 2008 and 2012 were retrospectively studied. to be eligible, patients were required to have sputum culture and sensitivity results available. socio-demographic, clinical, pre-admission and in-hospital treatment data were also obtained. results: of 400 patients with a radiologically confirmed diagnosis of cap, 232 fulfilled the study criteria; 122 (52.6%) were women and the mean age was 50.6 +/- 18.8 years. aetiological agents were identified from sputum in 189 (81.5%) patients. streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 90, 47.6%) was the most frequent  isolate followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 62, 32.8%), staphylococcus aureus  (n = 24, 12.7%) and streptococcus pyogenes (n = 13, 6.9%). the pathogens were most sensitive to levofloxacin (77%), ceftazidime (75.5%) and ofloxacin (55.8%).  the susceptibility of the isolates to antibiotics most frequently presecribed for empirical therapy was low (co-amoxiclav, 47.6%; ciprofloxacin, 45.9% and ceftriaxone, 47.6%) and this was associated with higher mortality and/or longer duration of hospital stay in survivors. conclusion: strep. pneumoniae and k. pneumoniae were the most common causes of cap. the pathogens were most sensitive  to levofloxacin and ceftazidime. we suggest that these antibiotics should increasingly be considered as superior options for empirical treatment of cap in  nigeria.

TI  == real-time polymerase chain reaction for microbiological diagnosis of parapneumonic effusions in canadian children.
AB  == background: community-acquired pneumonia (cap) complicated by parapneumonic effusion/empyema is an infectious syndrome commonly encountered by physicians caring for children in canada. objective: to investigate the incremental benefit  of novel molecular testing for the microbiological diagnosis of pediatric cap complicated by parapneumonic effusion/empyema in canada. methods: a convenience sample of pleural fluid from 56 children who had been admitted to hospital in ontario with cap complicated by parapneumonic effusion between 2009 and 2011 was  examined. multiple uniplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) testing was  performed on these pleural fluids and compared with traditional culture-based testing of blood and pleural fluid samples. results: molecular methods detected a pathogen in 82% of cases, whereas traditional cultures of blood and pleural fluids detected a pathogen in only 25%. the majority of parapneumonic effusions were associated with pneumococcal infection; streptococcus pneumoniae was detected in 62% of the samples using molecular methods but in only 14% of samples using culture-based methods. streptococcus pyogenes, detected in 16% of samples using pcr, was the second most common pathogen found. no patients were found to have empyema caused by staphylococcus aureus. discussion: the results showed that multiple uniplex real-time pcr performed substantially better than traditional culture methods for microbiological diagnosis of cap complicated by effusion/ empyema. s pneumoniae and s pyogenes were found to be responsible for the majority of infections. the approach detected pathogens in a similar proportion of pleural fluid samples as previously reported nested pcr assays; furthermore, the real-time closed-well approach also minimized the risk of nonspecificity due  to cross-contamination relative to nested pcr. conclusions: real-time pcr for the detection of bacterial dna in pleural fluids has the potential to better define the microbiological cause of pediatric cap. this approach could help clinicians provide targeted antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == impetigo: diagnosis and treatment.
AB  == impetigo is the most common bacterial skin infection in children two to five years of age. there are two principal types: nonbullous (70% of cases) and bullous (30% of cases). nonbullous impetigo, or impetigo contagiosa, is caused by staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, and is characterized by honey-colored crusts on the face and extremities. impetigo primarily affects the  skin or secondarily infects insect bites, eczema, or herpetic lesions. bullous impetigo, which is caused exclusively by s. aureus, results in large, flaccid bullae and is more likely to affect intertriginous areas. both types usually resolve within two to three weeks without scarring, and complications are rare, with the most serious being poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. treatment includes topical antibiotics such as mupirocin, retapamulin, and fusidic acid. oral antibiotic therapy can be used for impetigo with large bullae or when topical therapy is impractical. amoxicillin/clavulanate, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, clindamycin, doxycycline, minocycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and macrolides are options, but penicillin is not. natural therapies such as tea  tree oil; olive, garlic, and coconut oils; and manuka honey have been anecdotally successful, but lack sufficient evidence to recommend or dismiss them as treatment options. treatments under development include minocycline foam and ozenoxacin, a topical quinolone. topical disinfectants are inferior to antibiotics and should not be used. empiric treatment considerations have changed with the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, with methicillin-resistant s. aureus, macrolide-resistant streptococcus, and mupirocin-resistant streptococcus all documented. fusidic acid, mupirocin, and retapamulin cover methicillin-susceptible s. aureus and streptococcal infections. clindamycin proves helpful in suspected methicillin-resistant s. aureus infections. trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole covers methicillin-resistant s. aureus  infection, but is inadequate for streptococcal infection.

TI  == acute cervical lymphadenitis and infections of the retropharyngeal and parapharyngeal spaces in children.
AB  == background: acute cervical adenitis can evolve into suppurative cervical lymphadenitis and may sometimes be associated with infection of the retropharyngeal and parapharyngeal spaces (i.e., retropharyngeal and poststyloid  parapharyngeal abscesses). this study aimed to describe the clinical presentation of acute cervical lymphadenitis and infections of the retropharyngeal and parapharyngeal spaces in children and examine the management of these conditions. methods: this was a retrospective study including children from 3 months to 18 years old who were hospitalized in the pediatric department of the centre-intercommunal-de-creteil between january 2003 and may 2010. selected cases were based on the diagnosis of acute cervical lymphadenitis, suppurative cervical lymphadenitis, or infections of the retropharyngeal or parapharyngeal spaces. case history, clinical signs, laboratory tests, imaging, treatment and clinical course were collected from patient charts. results: we included 75 children (54 males [72%]); 62 (83%) were < 6 years old. diagnoses were acute cervical lymphadenitis in 43 patients (57%), suppurative cervical lymphadenitis in 13 (17%), retropharyngeal or poststyloid parapharyngeal abscess in 18 (24%) and cervical necrotizing fasciitis in 1 (1%). in total, 72 patients (96%) presented fever and 34 (45%) had torticollis. suppurative cervical lymphadenitis or abscesses of the retropharyngeal or poststyloid parapharyngeal spaces was significantly higher for children with than without torticollis (52.9% vs. 4.8%,  p < 0.001). in all, 21 patients among the 44 > 3 years old (48%) underwent a rapid antigen detection test (radt) for group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus pyogenes; results for 10 were positive (48%). contrast-enhanced ct scan of the neck in children with torticollis (n = 31) demonstrated an abscess in 21 (68%). fine-needle aspiration was performed in 8 patients (11%) and 8 (11%) required surgical drainage. bacteriology was positive in 8 patients (11%), with a predominance of staphylococcus aureus and s. pyogenes. all patients received intravenous antibiotics and the outcome was favorable regardless of surgery. recurrence was observed in only 1 case among the 34 patients with a follow-up visit after discharge. conclusion: our data suggest that presentation with cervical lymphadenitis associated with fever and torticollis requires evaluation  by contrast-enhanced ct scan. furthermore, abscess drainage should be restricted  to the most severely affected patients who do not respond to antibiotic therapy.

TI  == antiinfective therapy with a small molecule inhibitor of staphylococcus aureus sortase.
AB  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is the most frequent cause of  hospital-acquired infection, which manifests as surgical site infections, bacteremia, and sepsis. due to drug-resistance, prophylaxis of mrsa infection with antibiotics frequently fails or incites nosocomial diseases such as clostridium difficile infection. sortase a is a transpeptidase that anchors surface proteins in the envelope of s. aureus, and sortase mutants are unable to  cause bacteremia or sepsis in mice. here we used virtual screening and optimization of inhibitor structure to identify 3-(4-pyridinyl)-6-(2-sodiumsulfonatephenyl)[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazo le and related compounds, which block sortase activity in vitro and in vivo. sortase inhibitors do not affect in vitro staphylococcal growth yet protect mice  against lethal s. aureus bacteremia. thus, sortase inhibitors may be useful as antiinfective therapy to prevent hospital-acquired s. aureus infection in high-risk patients without the side effects of antibiotics.

TI  == filtration of crushed tablet suspensions has potential to reduce infection incidence in people who inject drugs.
AB  == introduction and aims: the medical complications of injecting preparations from crushed tablets can be severe, and most can be attributed to the injection of insoluble particles and micro-organisms. previously we have shown that most of the particles can be removed by filtration, but it was not known whether bacteria could also be filtered in the presence of a high particle load. this study aims to determine the feasibility of filtration to remove bacteria from injections prepared from tablets. design and methods: injections were prepared from crushed  slow-release morphine tablets, in mixed bacterial suspensions of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the injection suspensions were passed through syringe filters of porosity 0.45 or 0.20 mum, or  combined 0.8 then 0.2 mum, and the bacterial load was counted. results: bacterial concentrations in unfiltered injections were 2.5-4.3 x 10(6) colony forming units ml(-1) . both the 0.20 and 0.45 mum filters blocked unless a prefilter (cigarette filter) was used first. the 0.2 mum filter and the combined 0.8/0.2 mum filter reduced the bacteria to the limit of detection (10 colony forming units ml(-1) )  or below. filtration through a 0.45 mum filter was slightly less effective. discussion and conclusions: use of a 0.2 mum filter, together with other injection hygiene measures, offers the prospect of greatly reducing the medical complications of injecting crushed tablets and should be considered as a highly effective harm reduction method. it is very likely that these benefits would also apply to other illicit drug injections, although validation studies are needed.

AB  == the nature of association between demodex mites and bacteria involved in bovine demodectic mange lesions and the normal flora inhabiting the skin of noninfected  animals was investigated. demodex bovis and d. ghanensis mites were isolated from the infected purulent material extracted from skin and meibomian gland lesions, respectively. the mites could not be demonstrated in skin brushings or impression smears from the eyes of noninfected cattle. pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes (group a)) and opportunistic organisms (proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and trueperella pyogenes) were isolated from skin lesions of demodectic mange, and moraxella bovis and staphylococcus aureus were isolated from meibomian gland lesions. bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes (group a) were isolated from skin brushings from noninfected cattle. the nature of association between demodex mites and bacteria in demodectic mange lesions is synergistic and of equal significance. pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria facilitated the establishment of demodex mites in the lesions produced and provided an excellent  microclimate for the mites to propagate and reproduce, resulting in severe and progressive disease. the "high-turnover" granulomatous reaction which characterized the histopathological changes proved that demodex mites and associated bacteria were persistent and immunogenic.

TI  == bacterial spectrum of spontaneously ruptured otitis media in the era of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination in germany.
AB  == otitis media is a common pediatric disease and the main reason for antibiotic prescription in children. before implementation of routine childhood pneumococcal vaccination in germany, serotypes contained in the seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pcv) were among the most frequent pneumococcal serotypes responsible for acute otitis media (aom). this report describes the first 3 years of a prospective, multicenter, epidemiological cross-sectional study examining the bacteriology of middle ear fluids (mef) and nasopharyngeal swabs (nps) of children 2 months to 5 years of age with spontaneously perforated aom in the era  of routine pneumococcal vaccination. mef was obtained from 963 subjects; nps from 877. reported case numbers steeply decreased over the three study years even though the recruiting base remained the same. among subjects with relevant bacterial growth in their mef swabs, 113 (11.7%) had streptococcus pyogenes, 97 (10.1%) staphylococcus aureus, 88 (9.1%) streptococcus pneumoniae, 63 (6.5%) haemophilus influenzae, and 8 (0.8%) moraxella catarrhalis. s. pneumoniae isolates decreased from 41 (9.3%) in year 1 to 12 (5.7%) in year 3 (p = 0.128). pcv7 serotypes accounted for only 7.9% (n = 7) of isolated pneumococci. of the 877 subjects with nps cultures, 465 (53.0%) carried s. pneumoniae, 314 (35.8%) h. influenzae, 292 (33.3%) m. catarrhalis, and 110 (12.5%) s. pyogenes; 79.4% (n = 765) of the children were vaccinated with at least one dose of pcv. carriage of pneumococci was slightly lower in vaccinated (47.8%) than in unvaccinated (52.7%) children (p = 0.254). pcv7 serotypes were carried by 9.6% of unvaccinated children but by only 4.2% of vaccinated children, resulting in a 56.3% vaccine effectiveness. conclusions: following universal pcv7 immunization, a clear epidemiological impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination was observed as pcv7 serotypes have almost disappeared among aom.

TI  == chromosomal islands of streptococcus pyogenes and related streptococci: molecular switches for survival and virulence.
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes is a significant pathogen of humans, annually causing over 700,000,000 infections and 500,000 deaths. virulence in s. pyogenes is closely linked to mobile genetic elements like phages and chromosomal islands (ci). s. pyogenes phage-like chromosomal islands (spyci) confer a complex mutator phenotype on their host. spyci integrate into the 5' end of dna mismatch repair (mmr) gene mutl, which also disrupts downstream operon genes lmrp, ruva, and tag. during early logarithmic growth, spyci excise from the bacterial chromosome and replicate as episomes, relieving the mutator phenotype. as growth slows and the cells enter stationary phase, spyci reintegrate into the chromosome, again silencing the mmr operon. this system creates a unique growth-dependent and reversible mutator phenotype. additional ci using the identical attachment site in mutl have been identified in related species, including streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus parauberis, and streptococcus canis. these ci have small genomes, which range from 13 to 20 kb, conserved integrase and dna replication genes, and no identifiable genes encoding capsid proteins. spyci may  employ a helper phage for packaging and dissemination in a fashion similar to the staphylococcus aureus pathogenicity islands (sapi). outside of the core replication and integration genes, spyci and related ci show considerable diversity with the presence of many indels that may contribute to the host cell phenotype or fitness. spyci are a subset of a larger family of streptococcal ci who potentially regulate the expression of other host genes. the biological and phylogenetic analysis of streptococcal chromosomal islands provides important clues as to how these chromosomal islands help s. pyogenes and other streptococcal species persist in human populations in spite of antibiotic therapy and immune challenges.

TI  == dual stimulation with bacterial and viral components increases the expression of  hepcidin in human monocytes.
AB  == hepcidin belongs to the antimicrobial peptide (amp) family and is the key regulator of iron metabolism. it modulates iron homeostasis by binding to, and degrading the iron exporter molecule, ferroportin, thus inhibiting cellular iron  efflux. many antimicrobial peptides have a dual function; some are able to act directly as an antimicrobial agent as well as having an immunoregulatory role in  the host. toll-like receptors (tlrs) bind to components of microorganisms, activate cellular signal transduction pathways and stimulate innate immune responses. the effect of tlr3 (poly i:c) and tlr9 (cpg) co-stimulation of thp-1-derived monocytes using purified tlr ligands showed that 24 h after exposure poly i:c and cpg ligands in combination, hepcidin expression was significantly increased (10-fold) when compared to the untreated control. this combination of tlr ligands mimics simultaneous bacterial and viral infections, thus suggesting a potential key role for hepcidin in combined infections. additionally, using a chequerboard assay, we have shown that hepcidin has an antagonistic effect in combination with the antibiotics rifampicin and tetracycline against staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pyogenes, evidenced by a fractional inhibitory concentration index  (fici) > 4. this finding has important implications for future treatment regimens especially in an era of increasing antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == parasitic scabies mites and associated bacteria joining forces against host complement defence.
AB  == scabies is a ubiquitous and contagious skin disease caused by the parasitic mite  sarcoptes scabiei epidemiological studies have identified scabies as a causative  agent for secondary skin infections caused by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. this is an important notion, as such bacterial infections can lead to serious downstream life-threatening complications. as the complement  system is the first line of host defence that confronts invading pathogens, both  the mite and bacteria produce a large array of molecules that inhibit the complement cascades. it is hypothesised that scabies mite complement inhibitors may play an important role in providing a favourable micro-environment for the establishment of secondary bacterial infections. this review aims to bring together the current literature on complement inhibition by scabies mites and bacteria associated with scabies and to discuss the proposed molecular link between scabies and bacterial co-infections.

TI  == vaccination against the m protein of streptococcus pyogenes prevents death after  influenza virus: s. pyogenes super-infection.
AB  == influenza virus infections are associated with a significant number of illnesses  and deaths on an annual basis. many of the deaths are due to complications from secondary bacterial invaders, including streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus  aureus, haemophilus influenzae, and streptococcus pyogenes. the beta-hemolytic bacteria s. pyogenes colonizes both skin and respiratory surfaces, and frequently presents clinically as strep throat or impetigo. however, when these bacteria gain access to normally sterile sites, they can cause deadly diseases including sepsis, necrotizing fasciitis, and pneumonia. we previously developed a model of  influenza virus:s. pyogenes super-infection, which we used to demonstrate that vaccination against influenza virus can limit deaths associated with a secondary  bacterial infection, but this protection was not complete. in the current study,  we evaluated the efficacy of a vaccine that targets the m protein of s. pyogenes  to determine whether immunity toward the bacteria alone would allow the host to survive an influenza virus:s. pyogenes super-infection. our data demonstrate that vaccination against the m protein induces igg antibodies, in particular those of  the igg1 and igg2a isotypes, and that these antibodies can interact with macrophages. ultimately, this vaccine-induced immunity eliminated death within our influenza virus:s. pyogenes super-infection model, despite the fact that all  m protein-vaccinated mice showed signs of illness following influenza virus inoculation. these findings identify immunity against bacteria as an important component of protection against influenza virus:bacteria super-infection.

AB  == skin infections represent an important public health issue and cost-driver. additionally, chronic skin lesions are sometimes colonized by gram-negative species. topical therapies are a key component in the management of mild-to-moderate skin infections. in such cases, topical antibiotics may be preferable to systemic treatment, since they maximize the effective doses at the  site of infection while minimizing the systemic side effects of the drugs. however, the prevalence of resistant strains is steadily increasing and cases of  sensitization are not uncommon. as a consequence, the ideal topical antibiotic should be selective (thus, minimizing cross-resistance), have weak sensitization  potential, penetrate the skin efficiently, reach adequate local doses at the site of infection, and finally be available in different formulations matching patients' preferences and needs. fusidic acid (fa) is a selective antibiotic available in several topical formulations. pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies have shown that, contrary to other topical antibiotics such as gentamicin or mupirocin, fa reaches high antimicrobial concentration at deep skin layers after topical application either on intact or damaged epidermis. several randomized controlled trials demonstrated that fa, in its various topical formulations, is very effective in treating skin infections, given its high bactericidal activity against s. aureus (including strains resistant to penicillin, methicillin, ampicillin, cloxacillin), s. epidermidis, streptococcus  pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, corinebatteria, clostridia. additionally, fa presents a low risk of resistance even in methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, a common pathogen implied in the etiology of skin infections and infected atopic eczema. such feature makes fa particularly useful in the management of these medical conditions. finally, possibly due to its large steric effect, fa has proved a very low risk of contact sensitization. overall, data on  fa efficacy, safety, sensitization potential, resistance profile and spectrum selectivity make it a first-choice option in the treatment of primary and secondary skin infection.

TI  == [identification of staphylococci directly from positive blood culture bottles by  maldi-tof ms system].
AB  == bloodstream infections are substantial causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. staphylococcus species are the most commonly isolated microorganisms from blood cultures in clinical microbiology laboratories. maldi-tof ms (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time- of- flight mass spectrometry)  system allows the identification of microorganisms directly from positive blood culture bottles. the aim of this study was to evaluate the maldi-tof ms system for the identification of staphylococci directly from the positive blood culture  bottles which revealed the presence of gram-positive cocci by staining. a total of 96 positive blood culture bottles that yielded gram-positive cocci by gram stain were evaluated. these blood cultures were obtained from 69 patients between december 2013-february 2014. conventional methods and bd phoenix automated bacterial identification system (becton dickinson, usa) were used for routine identification. the strains were also identified by real-time taqman pcr (qpcr) which was considered as the reference method. in maldi-tof ms method, maldi sepsityper kit was used for the bacterial identification and all measurements were carried out by using microflex lt instrument and flexcontrol 3.0 software (bruker daltonics, usa). of 96 culture bottles positive for gram-positive cocci,  90 were correctly identified as staphylococci at genus level with all the three study methods (qpcr, bd phoenix, bruker maldi-tof ms). the other six samples were identified as enterococcus faecium (n= 4) and streptococcus pyogenes (n= 2) by both phoenix and the maldi-tof systems. of the 90 samples, 87 were identified at  the species level (15 s.aureus, 33 s.epidermidis, 29 s.hominis, 10 s.haemolyticus) and three at the genus level by the reference qpcr method. when comparing the results obtained by qpcr and bruker maldi-tof ms, incompatibility was detected for three isolates. those isolates were identified as s.hominis by qpcr, however two of them were identified as s.haemolyticus and one as s.epidermidis by maldi-tof ms. compared with real-time taqman pcr it was detected that bruker maldi tof ms was identified 100% of s.aureus to the genus and species level and 100% and 96.6% of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) to the genus and species level, respectively. in conclusion, it was thought that bruker maldi  tof ms system may allow rapid and reliable identification of s.aureus and cns directly from positive blood culture bottles compared with the routine methods used in the clinical microbiology laboratory.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides are highly abundant and active in postoperative pleural drainage fluids.
AB  == background: the human lung is considered a nonsterile organ, and surgical interventions therefore take place in a more or less contaminated operating field. nevertheless, infectious complications of the pleural cavity are low after major lung resections. antimicrobial peptides (amps) are part of the innate immunity and display a broad capacity to kill pathogens. we hypothesized that the pleural space must have a high natural antimicrobial barrier and that amps might  effectively protect the pleural cavity. methods: pleural effusions were collected after lung operations. antimicrobial activity of the fluids against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens was analyzed by microdilution assays. amps were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa), polymerase chain reaction (pcr), and immunohistochemical analysis. the impact of proinflammatory triggers on amp release from pleural mesothelial cells was evaluated. results: antimicrobial activity assays revealed high bactericidal properties of postoperative pleural drainage fluids. they effectively killed gram-negative pathogens (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa) as well as gram-positive pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes). a variety of amps was detected at constantly high concentrations in the pleural fluids. they mainly derived from leukocytes and pleural epithelium. although proinflammatory cytokine levels were elevated in the postoperative pleural fluids, amp expression could not be augmented by toll-like receptor (tlr) triggering or by the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (il)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor (tnf)alpha. conclusions: we provide the first evidence of a high  abundance of amps in postoperative pleural fluids. our findings might explain the broad protection against infectious complications of the pleural space after major lung operations.

TI  == novel copper (ii) alginate hydrogels and their potential for use as anti-bacterial wound dressings.
AB  == the incorporation of a metal ion, with antimicrobial activity, into an alginate dressing is an attractive approach to minimize infection in a wound. in this work, copper (ii) cross-linked alginate hydrogels were successfully prepared using a two-step cross-linking procedure. in the first step, solid alginate films were prepared using a solvent-casting method from soft gels of alginate solutions that had been lightly cross-linked using a copper (ii) (cu(2+)) sulfate solution. in the second step, the films were further cross-linked in a corresponding cu(2+) sulfate solution using a dipping method to further improve their dimensional stability. alginate solution (at 2%w/v) and cu(2+) sulfate solution (at 2%w/v) in acetate buffer at a low ph provided soft films with excellent swelling behavior.  an increase in either cu(2+) ion concentration or cross-linking time led to hydrogels with more densely-cross-linked networks that limited water absorption.  the hydrogels clearly showed antibacterial activity against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pyogenes, which was proportional to  the cu(2+) ion concentration. blood coagulation studies showed that the tested copper (ii) cross-linked alginate hydrogels had a tendency to coagulate fibrin, and possibly had an effect on pro-thrombotic coagulation and platelet activation. conclusively, the prepared films are likely candidates as antibacterial wound dressings.

TI  == subclinical pulmonary pathogenic infection in camels slaughtered in cairo, egypt.
AB  == introduction: camels migrate between the open boundaries of sudan and egypt either for grazing or for slaughtering. bad hygiene and stress is often related to pulmonary diseases in camels. this study investigated whether camels slaughtered in cairo carried pulmonary infections. methodology: five hundred lung tissues of slaughtered camels were examined and 100 samples suspected for pulmonary infection were subjected to microbial identification and histopathology. results: a total of 70 lung tissues revealed 97 bacterial isolates of 8 species, including staphylococcus aureus (37.14%), escherichia coli (27.14%), klebsiella pneumoniae (26.71%), bacillus spp. (25.72%), streptococcus pyogenes (10%), corynebacterium spp. (8.85 %), pasteurella spp. (2.85%), and arcanobacterium pyogenes (1.4%). some of these species were earlier reported to be associated with pulmonary infection. histopathology revealed different types of pneumonia in 50% of the investigated lungs. conclusions: a considerable number of apparently healthy camels carry pathogenic agents in their lower respiratory tracts. immunosuppression and stressful conditions might influence these pathogens to induce respiratory diseases in camels. thus, the infected camels might act as reservoir of these infections agents. if adequate care is not taken, this might be a threat to abattoir workers and may spread infections to humans.

TI  == subterfuge and sabotage: evasion of host innate defenses by invasive gram-positive bacterial pathogens.
AB  == the development of a severe invasive bacterial infection in an otherwise healthy  individual is one of the most striking and fascinating aspects of human medicine. a small cadre of gram-positive pathogens of the genera streptococcus and staphylococcus stand out for their unique invasive disease potential and sophisticated ability to counteract the multifaceted components of human innate defense. this review illustrates how these leading human disease agents evade host complement deposition and activation, impede phagocyte recruitment and activation, resist the microbicidal activities of host antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species, escape neutrophil extracellular traps, and promote and accelerate phagocyte cell death through the action of pore-forming cytolysins. understanding the molecular basis of bacterial innate immune resistance can open  new avenues for therapeutic intervention geared to disabling specific virulence factors and resensitizing the pathogen to host innate immune clearance.

TI  == hospitalist perspective on the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections.
AB  == the prevalence of skin and soft tissue infections (sstis) has been increasing in  the united states. these infections are associated with an increase in hospital admissions. hospitalists play an increasingly important role in the management of these infections and need to use hospital resources efficiently and effectively.  when available, observation units are useful for treating low-risk patients who do not require hospital admission. imaging tools may help to exclude abscesses and necrotizing soft tissue infections; however, surgical exploration remains the principal means of diagnosing necrotizing soft tissue infections. the most common pathogens that cause sstis are streptococci and staphylococcus aureus. methicillin-resistant s aureus (mrsa) is a prevalent pathogen, and concerns are increasing regarding the unclear distinctions between community-acquired and hospital-acquired mrsa. other less frequent pathogens that cause sstis include enterococcus species, escherichia coli, klebsiella species, enterobacter species, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. cephalexin and clindamycin are suitable options for infections caused by streptococcal species and methicillin-susceptible s aureus.  the increasing resistance of s aureus and streptococcus pyogenes to erythromycin  limits its use in these infections, and better alternatives are available. parenteral cefazolin, nafcillin, or oxacillin can be used in hospitalized patients with nonpurulent cellulitis caused by streptococci and methicillin-susceptible s aureus. when oral mrsa therapy is indicated, clindamycin, doxycycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or linezolid is appropriate. vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline, telavancin, and ceftaroline fosamil are intravenous options that should be used in mrsa infections that require patient hospitalization. in the treatment of patients with sstis, hospitalists are at the forefront of providing proper patient care that reduces hospital costs, duration of therapy, and therapeutic failures. this  review updates guidelines on the management of sstis with a focus on infections caused by s aureus, particularly mrsa, and outlines the role of the hospitalist in the effective management of sstis.

TI  == susceptibility of common bacterial respiratory pathogens to antimicrobial agents  in outpatients from south backa district.
AB  == introduction: acute infections of the upper respiratory tract are the most common reasons why patients visit general practitioners. overuse of antibiotics in treatment of these conditions is extremely common practice although these infections are most frequently caused by viruses. the aim of this study was to determine the distribution and susceptibility of common pathogens to antimicrobial agents that cause infections of the upper respiratory tract in outpatients and to determine whether the results obtained from the examined sample were in accordance with the recommendations of the current national guideline. material and methods: the study included 945 strains isolated from the throat and nasal swabs from january 1st to march 31st, 2008, as well as from 330  strains isolated from january 1st to march 31st, 2013 in south backa district, serbia. susceptibility tests were performed by the standard disc diffusion method and according to the criteria recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute. results: the most commonly isolated strains were streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, branchamella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae. susceptibility of streptococcus pyogenes, branchamella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae to examined antibiotics did not substantially change over the two study periods. none of the isolates of staphylococcus aures demonstrated resistance to methicillin in 2008, while the percentage of resistant strains was 5.93% in 2013. susceptibility rates of staphylococcus pneumoniae isolates to erythromycin and clindamycin were lower in 2013 than in 2008. conclusion: the investigation results follow the recommendations of the national guideline for the usage of natural penicillin in the treatment of tonsillopharyngitis. amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is recommended for the treatment of rhinosinusitis, and second generation cephalosporins are the second choice.

TI  == a scabies mite serpin interferes with complement-mediated neutrophil functions and promotes staphylococcal growth.
AB  == background: scabies is a contagious skin disease caused by the parasitic mite sarcoptes scabiei. the disease is highly prevalent worldwide and known to predispose to secondary bacterial infections, in particular by streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus. reports of scabies patients co-infected with  methicillin resistant s. aureus (mrsa) pose a major concern for serious down-stream complications. we previously reported that a range of complement inhibitors secreted by the mites promoted the growth of s. pyogenes. here, we show that a recently characterized mite serine protease inhibitor (smsb4) inhibits the complement-mediated blood killing of s. aureus. methodology/principal findings: blood killing of s. aureus was measured in whole  blood bactericidal assays, counting viable bacteria recovered after treatment in  fresh blood containing active complement and phagocytes, treated with recombinant smsb4. smsb4 inhibited the blood killing of various strains of s. aureus including methicillin-resistant and methicillin-sensitive isolates. staphylococcal growth was promoted in a dose-dependent manner. we investigated the effect of smsb4 on the complement-mediated neutrophil functions, namely phagocytosis, opsonization and anaphylatoxin release, by flow cytometry and in enzyme linked immuno sorbent assays (elisa). smsb4 reduced phagocytosis of s. aureus by neutrophils. it inhibited the deposition of c3b, c4b and properdin on the bacteria surface, but did not affect the depositions of c1q and mbl. smsb4 also inhibited c5 cleavage as indicated by a reduced c5b-9 deposition. conclusions/significance: we postulate that smsb4 interferes with the activation  of all three complement pathways by reducing the amount of c3 convertase formed.  we conclude that smsb4 interferes with the complement-dependent killing function  of neutrophils, thereby reducing opsonization, phagocytosis and further recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection. as a consequence secreted scabies mites complement inhibitors, such as smsb4, provide favorable conditions  for the onset of s. aureus co-infection in the scabies-infected microenvironment  by suppressing the immediate host immune response.

TI  == scabies mites alter the skin microbiome and promote growth of opportunistic pathogens in a porcine model.
AB  == background: the resident skin microbiota plays an important role in restricting pathogenic bacteria, thereby protecting the host. scabies mites (sarcoptes scabiei) are thought to promote bacterial infections by breaching the skin barrier and excreting molecules that inhibit host innate immune responses. epidemiological studies in humans confirm increased incidence of impetigo, generally caused by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, secondary to the epidermal infestation with the parasitic mite. it is therefore possible that mite infestation could alter the healthy skin microbiota making way for the  opportunistic pathogens. a longitudinal study to test this hypothesis in humans is near impossible due to ethical reasons. in a porcine model we generated scabies infestations closely resembling the disease manifestation in humans and investigated the scabies associated changes in the skin microbiota over the course of a mite infestation. methodology/principal findings: in a 21 week trial, skin scrapings were collected from pigs infected with s. scabies var. suis and scabies-free control animals. a total of 96 skin scrapings were collected before, during infection and after acaricide treatment, and analyzed by bacterial 16s rdna tag-encoded flx-titanium amplicon pyrosequencing. we found significant changes in the epidermal microbiota, in particular a dramatic increase in staphylococcus correlating with the onset of mite infestation in animals challenged with scabies mites. this increase persisted beyond treatment from mite infection and healing of skin. furthermore, the staphylococci population shifted  from the commensal s. hominis on the healthy skin prior to scabies mite challenge to s. chromogenes, which is increasingly recognized as being pathogenic, coinciding with scabies infection in pigs. in contrast, all animals in the scabies-free cohort remained relatively free of staphylococcus throughout the trial. conclusions/significance: this is the first experimental in vivo evidence  supporting previous assumptions that establishment of pathogens follow scabies infection. our findings provide an explanation for a biologically important aspect of the disease pathogenesis. the methods developed from this pig trial will serve as a guide to analyze human clinical samples. studies building on this will offer implications for development of novel intervention strategies against  the mites and the secondary infections.

AB  == background: toxic shock syndrome (tss) is an acute toxin-mediated illness caused  by toxin-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. there is no recent data regarding incidence, management and mortality of tss in uk children. methods: consultants from paediatric and burns units in the uk and ireland, reported cases of tss seen between november 2008 and december 2009, via  the british paediatric surveillance unit. respondents were sent questionnaires requesting detailed information about tss cases. established criteria were used to divide cases into staphylococcal or streptococcal tss. results: forty-nine cases were identified overall; 29 cases of streptococcal tss (18 confirmed and 11 probable) and 20 cases of staphylococcal tss (15 confirmed and 5 probable). the incidence of tss children in the uk & the republic of ireland was calculated to be 0.38 per 100 000 children. children with staphylococcal tss were older than those with streptococcal tss (9.5 vs 3.8 years; p<0.003). paediatric intensive care facilities were used for 78% of cases (invasive ventilatory support 69%; inotropic support 67%; haemofiltration 12%). agents with antitoxin effects were underused; clindamycin 67%, intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) 20%, fresh frozen plasma 40%. there were eight deaths, all in the streptococcal group (28% of streptococcal cases)-none were given ivig. conclusions: streptococcal tss was as  frequent as staphylococcal tss, contrasting with previous literature. children with streptococcal tss had a higher mortality than those with staphylococcal tss  (28% vs 0%; p<0.05). recommended immunomodulatory agents (ivig and clindamycin) were underused. this study highlights the need for a guideline to improve management of tss in children.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides as potential tool to fight bacterial biofilm.
AB  == recently, the topic of biofilm has met a huge interest of researchers owing to a  significant role played by this microbial life form in severe infections. these well organised three-dimensional microbial communities are characterized by a strong resistance to antimicrobials. biofilms significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality as related infections are very difficult to treat due to  their tendency to relapse after the withdrawal of antibiotics. according to the literature, antimicrobial peptides (amps) have a high potential as future antibiofilm agents. amps can influence various stages of biofilm formation and exhibit antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of microorganisms including multi-drug resistant strains. the purpose of the present study was to determine the activity of antimicrobial peptides against biofilms formed by a variety of bacterial strains. to do this, the following antimicrobial peptides were synthesized: citropin 1.1, lipopeptides palm-kk-nh2 and palm-rr-nh2, omiganan, pexiganan and temporin a. antimicrobial activity of the compounds and conventional antibiotics was determined for planktonic cells and biofilms formed  by reference strains of gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes) and gram-negative (escherichia  coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis) bacteria. amps exhibited a strong antibacterial activity against gram-positive strains, while gram-negative  bacteria were less susceptible. antimicrobial activity of the tested peptides against biofilms formed by gram-positive organisms was significantly stronger as  compared to that of conventional antimicrobials.

TI  == a recent case of periorbital necrotizing fasciitis--presentation to definitive reconstruction within an in-theater combat hospital setting.
AB  == first described in 1924, necrotizing fasciitis (nf) is a rapidly progressing, severe suppurative infection of the superficial fascia, often associated with vascular thrombosis and necrosis of the overlying skin. despite advances in medical therapy, the mortality remains high, with rates exceeding 25 to 50% in some studies. early diagnosis and treatment is paramount in the management of this serious infection and should include wide surgical debridement and drainage  of all necrotic tissues, coupled with aggressive parenteral antibiotics. this infectious process has been commonly associated with traumatic events in patients with compromised immune systems, diabetes, chronic steroid use, and alcoholism. the common microbacterial organisms associated with necrotizing fasciitis include streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus and less commonly, facultative and anaerobic microorganisms. most cases typically present in the extremities, trunk, and/or groin regions. although this virulent soft tissue infection can occur within the face and neck areas, cases of isolated periorbital nf have been  relatively uncommon. however, head and neck cases of nf have had high associated  morbidity and mortality rates. in recent publications, the reported mortality rate for isolated periorbital nf was not insignificant, ranging from 8.5 to 12.5%. the prognosis, morbidity, and mortality rates will be greatly increased in those patients who present late in the infectious phase, have a delay in diagnosis and/or treatment, or who demonstrate extension of this virulent infection into the face, cervical, or sternal/mediastinal regions. an aggressive  multimodal approach is required in treating periorbital necrotizing infection, with the main tenant remaining wide and adequate surgical debridement of affected tissues. this difficult clinical situation can create a subsequent challenge with respect to achieving good functional and cosmetic outcomes in those patients with periorbital nf. delayed reconstruction of the eyelids with skin grafts and/or facial flaps is often required to avoid late complications such as cicatricial lid retraction, lid malposition, exposure keratopathy, and potential loss of vision. we describe a patient who presented to a military combat hospital with a  virulent periorbital soft tissue infection. we have outlined his treatment course from the initial presentation through definitive reconstruction.

TI  == bacterial isolates associated with pelvic inflammatory disease among female patients attending some hospitals in abuja, nigeria.
AB  == background: pelvic inflammatory disease refers to any infection in the female lower reproductive tract that spreads to the upper reproductive tract. the disease comprises a spectrum of inflammatory disorders of the upper female genital tract, including any combination of endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess and pelvic peritonitis. pid is not a notifiable disease in most countries, so accurate statistics are not available. this situation is not in any way different here in nigeria and more so in the federal capital territory, abuja where this research was conducted, there had never been any published report so far on pid. it therefore became pertinent that such studies be carried out to evaluate the bacterial organisms which may be associated with the disease in this part of nigeria so that health care providers could take a better look at this affliction in women. materials and methods: endocervical swabs totalling 100 were aseptically collected from patients with confirmed pelvic inflammatory disease (pid), attending some hospitals in abuja, nigeria for detection of bacterial pathogens based on cultural and biochemical characterisation tests. antibiogram was also conducted on the identified bacterial isolates. results: out of the 100 samples analysed, 43% yielded pure cultures of bacterial isolates, 2% yielded mixed cultures while no bacterial growths were recorded from the remaining 55% samples. organisms encountered were  staphylococcus aureus (16%), escherichia coli (10%), streptococcus faecalis (8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4%), streptococcus pyogenes (3%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), proteus rettgeri (2%) and proteus mirabilis (1%). the highest percentage occurrence of pathogenic isolates was observed in polygamous married patients (90%). the age group most affected falls within the mean age 30.5 years (68%) while the least affected group falls within the mean age 40.5 years (5%). there was a significant difference in the acquisition of pid in relation to marital status (p < 0.05). however there was no significant difference in the acquisition of the disease with respect to age (p > 0.05). antibiogram patterns of pathogenic isolates revealed varied resistance to most of the antibiotics employed. cefotaxime (a new generation cephalosporin antibiotic) was established in this study as the best antimicrobial agent for treatment of pid due to gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from the women examined. conclusion: in conclusion, pelvic inflammatory disease is a major health problem in developed or developing countries of the world. pid is not a notifiable disease, as accurate statistics on disease prevalence are rarely available. there is therefore no doubt thousands of young women have salpingitis every year and their sheer number makes it an important health problem. pid hence can be said to be a very serious  complication of sexually transmitted disease which should be critically and promptly handled by healthcare providers. the right type sample should be aseptically collected and be appropriately handled for laboratory investigation.  treatment of pid should be initiated as soon as the presumptive diagnosis has been made. immediate administration of antibiotics has been effective in the long-term sequelae associated with pid, especially new generation antibiotics, such as cefotaxime as recorded in this study.

TI  == cutaneous bacterial infections caused by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus  pyogenes in infants and children.
AB  == acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (sssis) are among the most common bacterial infections in children. the medical burden of sssis, particularly abscesses, has increased nationwide since the emergence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. sssis represent a wide spectrum of disease severity. prompt recognition, timely institution of appropriate therapy, and judicious antimicrobial use optimize patient outcomes. for abscesses, incision and drainage are paramount and might avoid the need for antibiotic treatment in uncomplicated cases. if indicated, empiric antimicrobial  therapy should target streptococcus pyogenes for nonpurulent sssis, such as uncomplicated cellulitis, and s aureus for purulent sssis such as abscesses.

TI  == comparative studies on genital infections and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of isolates from camels (camelus dromedarius) and cows (bos indicus) in  maiduguri, north-eastern nigeria.
AB  == a total of 160 genitalia of camels and cows were investigated in maiduguri, north-eastern nigeria to compare bacterial isolates and the antibacterial susceptibilities of some of the isolates. streptococcus (str.) pyogenes (31%), escherichia (e.) coli (24%) and staphylococcus (s.) aureus (20%) were the most common vaginal bacterial isolates in camels; while e. coli (73%), str. pyogenes (18%) and s. aureus (11%) were the most frequent isolates in the cows. of the 78  uterine isolates recovered in this study, e. coli was the most prominent in camels (8%) and cows (54%). the overall weight of genital infection in all camels and cows examined was highest (p < 0.05) with e. coli (79%), but there was no difference (p > 0.05) between vaginal and uterine bacterial isolates from camels  and cows in this study. the relative risk (rr) for an infection of the vagina with e coli (3.04, 95% confidence interval (ci): 2.104 to 4.398, p < 0.0001) is more in cows compared to the camel, but the rr for vaginal infection with s. aureus and str. pyogenes were lower in cows compared to camels. the e. coli and s. aureus isolates were highly susceptible to the antimicrobial agents tested. therefore effective management of reproductive disorders associated with these pathogens can be achieved with proper use of these antimicrobial agents in these  animal species.

TI  == optimal insemination and replacement decisions to minimize the cost of pathogen-specific clinical mastitis in dairy cows.
AB  == mastitis is a serious production-limiting disease, with effects on milk yield, milk quality, and conception rate, and an increase in the risk of mortality and culling. the objective of this study was 2-fold: (1) to develop an economic optimization model that incorporates all the different types of pathogens that cause clinical mastitis (cm) categorized into 8 classes of culture results, and account for whether the cm was a first, second, or third case in the current lactation and whether the cow had a previous case or cases of cm in the preceding lactation; and (2) to develop this decision model to be versatile enough to add additional pathogens, diseases, or other cow characteristics as more information  becomes available without significant alterations to the basic structure of the model. the model provides economically optimal decisions depending on the individual characteristics of the cow and the specific pathogen causing cm. the net returns for the basic herd scenario (with all cm included) were $507/cow per  year, where the incidence of cm (cases per 100 cow-years) was 35.6, of which 91.8% of cases were recommended for treatment under an optimal replacement policy. the cost per case of cm was $216.11. the cm cases comprised (incidences,  %) staphylococcus spp. (1.6), staphylococcus aureus (1.8), streptococcus spp. (6.9), escherichia coli (8.1), klebsiella spp. (2.2), other treated cases (e.g.,  pseudomonas; 1.1), other not treated cases (e.g., trueperella pyogenes; 1.2), and negative culture cases (12.7). the average cost per case, even under optimal decisions, was greatest for klebsiella spp. ($477), followed by e. coli ($361), other treated cases ($297), and other not treated cases ($280). this was followed by the gram-positive pathogens; among these, the greatest cost per case was due to staph. aureus ($266), followed by streptococcus spp. ($174) and staphylococcus spp. ($135); negative culture had the lowest cost ($115). the model recommended treatment for most cm cases (>85%); the range was 86.2% (klebsiella spp.) to 98.5% (staphylococcus spp.). in general, the optimal recommended time for replacement was up to 5 mo earlier for cows with cm compared with cows without cm. furthermore, although the parameter estimates implemented in this model are applicable to the dairy farms in this study, the parameters may be altered to be  specific to other dairy farms. cow rankings and values based on disease status, pregnancy status, and milk production can be extracted; these provide guidance when determining which cows to keep or cull.

TI  == influence of bacterial presence on biofilm formation of candida albicans.
AB  == purpose: candida albicans is an opportunistic pathogen that is commonly found in  human microflora. biofilm formation (bf) is known as a major virulence factor of  c. albicans. the aim of this study was to examine the influence of bacterial presence on biofilm formation of c. albicans. materials and methods: the bf of candida was investigated when it was co-cultured with c. albicans (c. albicans 53, a yeast with a low bf ability, and c. albicans 163, a yeast with high bf ability) and bacteria. bf was assessed with xtt reduction assay. a scanning electron microscope was used to determine the structure of the biofilm, and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify and quantify hyphae-associated genes. results: co-culturing with two different types  of bacteria increased the bf value. co-culturing with c. albicans 53 and 163 also increased the bf value compared to the value that was obtained when the c. albicans was cultured individually. however, co-culturing with bacteria decreased the bf value of c. albicans, and the bf of c. albicans 163 was markedly inhibited. the expression of adherence and morphology transition related genes were significantly inhibited by co-culturing with live bacteria. conclusion: bacteria have a negative effect on the formation of biofilm by c. albicans. this  mechanism is the result of the suppression of genes associated with the hyphae transition of c. albicans, and bacteria particles physically affected the biofilm architecture and biofilm formation.

AB  == silver compounds and especially silver sulfadiazine (agsd) are reported as effective antimicrobial agents against almost all known bacteria, fungi and some  viruses. however, agsd has been shown to be cytotoxic toward fibroblasts and keratinocytes in vitro and consequently to retard wound healing in vivo. the aim  of the present work was to evaluate the in vitro biocompatibility (cytotoxicity and proliferation), antimicrobial efficacy and cell motility gap closure (assay of wound closure) of mt/cs nanocomposites loaded with silver sulfadiazine (agsd). it is envisioned to be administered as a powder or a dressing for cutaneous application in the treatment of skin ulcers. the loading of agsd in mt/cs nanocomposites aimed at preventing the delay in wound healing, by decreasing the  cytotoxicity of agsd and maintaining its antimicrobial properties. nanocomposites were prepared by using different amounts of mt (100-2000 mg) and 40 ml of a 1% (w/w) chitosan glutamate aqueous solution. the relative amounts of agsd and chitosan in the systems were assessed by suitable analytic methods. the nanocomposite prepared using 100mg of mt was characterized for in vitro biocompatibility and proliferation and for wound healing using normal human dermal fibroblasts (nhdf). antimicrobial properties were evaluated against four reference bacterial strains: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. agsd loaded in the 100 mt/cs nanocomposite showed good in vitro biocompatibility and gap closure properties (fibroblasts) and maintained agsd antimicrobial properties, especially against p. aeruginosa, that often complicates skin lesions.

TI  == soluble t cell receptor vbeta domains engineered for high-affinity binding to staphylococcal or streptococcal superantigens.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus and group a streptococcus secrete a collection of toxins called superantigens (sags), so-called because they stimulate a large fraction of an individual's t cells. one consequence of this hyperactivity is massive cytokine release leading to severe tissue inflammation and, in some cases, systemic organ failure and death. the molecular basis of action involves the binding of the sag to both a t cell receptor (tcr) on a t cell and a class ii product of the major histocompatibility complex (mhc) on an antigen presenting cell. this cross-linking leads to aggregation of the tcr complex and signaling. a common feature of sags is that they bind with relatively low affinity to the variable region (v) of the beta chain of the tcr. despite this low affinity binding, sags are very potent, as each t cell requires only a small fraction of their receptors to be bound in order to trigger cytokine release. to develop high-affinity agents that could neutralize the activity of sags, and facilitate the development of detection assays, soluble forms of the vbeta regions have been engineered to affinities that are up to 3 million-fold higher for the sag. over the past decade, six different vbeta regions against sags from s. aureus (sea, seb, sec3, tsst-1) or s. pyogenes (spea and spec) have been engineered for high-affinity using yeast display and directed evolution. here we review the engineering of these high-affinity vbeta proteins, structural features of the six different sags and the vbeta proteins, and the specific properties of the engineered vbeta regions that confer high-affinity and specificity for their sag  ligands.

TI  == mesenchymal stromal (stem) cells suppress pro-inflammatory cytokine production but fail to improve survival in experimental staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome.
AB  == background: toxic shock syndrome (tss) is caused by an overwhelming host-mediated response to bacterial superantigens produced mainly by staphylococcus aureus and  streptococcus pyogenes. tss is characterized by aberrant activation of t cells and excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines ultimately resulting in capillary leak, septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction and high mortality rates. no therapeutic or vaccine has been approved by the u.s. food and drug administration for tss, and novel therapeutic strategies to improve clinical outcome are needed. mesenchymal stromal (stem) cells (mscs) are stromal cells capable of self-renewal and differentiation. moreover, mscs have immunomodulatory properties, including profound effects on activities of t cells and macrophages in specific contexts. based on the critical role of host-derived immune mediators in tss, we hypothesized that mscs could modulate the host-derived proinflammatory response triggered by staphylococcal enterotoxin b (seb) and improve survival in  experimental tss. methods: effects of mscs on proinflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood were measured in wild-type c57bl/6 mice injected with 50 mug of  seb. effects of mscs on survival were monitored in fatal experimental tss induced by consecutive doses of d-galactosamine (10 mg) and seb (10 mug) in hla-dr4 transgenic mice. results: despite significantly decreasing serum levels of il-2,  il-6 and tnf induced by seb in wild-type mice, human mscs failed to improve survival in experimental tss in hla-dr4 transgenic mice. similarly, a previously  described downstream mediator of human mscs, tnf-stimulated gene 6 (tsg-6), did not significantly improve survival in experimental tss. furthermore, murine mscs, whether unstimulated or pre-treated with ifngamma, failed to improve survival in  experimental tss. conclusions: our results suggest that the immunomodulatory effects of mscs are insufficient to rescue mice from experimental tss, and that mediators other than il-2, il-6 and tnf are likely to play critical mechanistic roles in the pathogenesis of experimental tss.

TI  == pathogen-specific effects on milk yield in repeated clinical mastitis episodes in holstein dairy cows.
AB  == the objective of this study was to estimate the effects of clinical mastitis (cm) cases due to different pathogens on milk yield in holstein cows. the first 3 cm cases in a cow's lactation were modeled. eight categories of pathogens were included: streptococcus spp.; staphylococcus aureus; coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns); escherichia coli; klebsiella spp.; cases with cm signs but no bacterial growth (above the level detectable by our microbiological procedures) observed in the culture sample, and cases with contamination (>/= 3 pathogens in the sample); other pathogens that may be treated with antibiotics (included citrobacter, corynebacterium bovis, enterobacter, enterococcus, pasteurella, pseudomonas; "other treatable"); and other pathogens not successfully treated with antibiotics (trueperella pyogenes, mycoplasma, prototheca, yeasts; "other not treatable"). data from 38,276 lactations in cows from 5 new york state dairy herds, collected from 2003-2004 until 2011, were analyzed. mixed models with an autoregressive correlation structure (to account for correlation among the repeated measures of milk yield within a lactation) were estimated. primiparous (lactation 1) and multiparous (lactations 2 and 3) cows were analyzed separately, as the shapes of their lactation curves differed.  primiparas were followed for up to 48 wk of lactation and multiparas for up to 44 wk. fixed effects included parity, calving season, week of lactation, cm (type, case number, and timing of cm in relation to milk production cycle), and other diseases (milk fever, retained placenta, metritis, ketosis, displaced abomasum).  herd was modeled as a random effect. clinical mastitis was more common in multiparas than in primiparas. in primiparas, streptococcus spp. occurred most frequently as the first case. in multiparas, e. coli was most common as the first case. in subsequent cases, cm cases with no specific growth or contamination were most common in both parity groups. the hazard of cm increased with case number. mastitic cows were generally higher producers before the cm episode than their nonmastitic herdmates. milk loss varied with pathogen and case number. in primiparas, the greatest losses were associated with e. coli and "other not treatable" organisms. in multiparas, the greatest losses were associated with klebsiella spp. and "other not treatable" organisms. milk loss was not associated with occurrence of cns. the findings may help farmers to make optimal management  decisions for their cows.

AB  == context: traditional medicinal plants have long been used in ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still  poorly known. objective: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in ankober district. methods: about 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes. results: plant extracts from embelia schimperi vatke (myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a  minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 64 microg/ml against b. cereus, l. monocytogenes, and s. pyogenes. growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of ocimum lamiifolium hochst. (lamiaceae) against s. pyogenes, and those of rubus steudneri schweinf. (rosaceae) against s. epidermidis at an mic value of 128 microg/ml. generally, 74% of ethanol extracts  (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial  strains tested at an mic value of 512 microg/ml or below. discussion and conclusions: results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed  strong antimicrobial activities.

AB  == background: new zealand is a developed country with high incidence of bacterial infections and postinfectious sequelae including rheumatic heart disease. we sought to describe the clinical and microbiology features of children with infective endocarditis (ie) between 1994 and 2012. methods: retrospective review  of patients <16 years identified from hospital records. results: in total 85 episodes occurred in 82 children and 68 (80%) were classified as definite ie and  17 as possible ie according to modified duke criteria. from pacific island countries, 13 cases were referred. there were 72 children who originated in new zealand, of whom 52% were either indigenous new zealand maori or pacific migrants. the median age at diagnosis was 7 (0-15) years. of the 85 cases, 51 (60%) had congenital heart disease 10 children with rheumatic heart disease developed ie. of the 85 cases, 35 (41%) met our criteria for healthcare-associated ie. 39/85 underwent surgery for ie. as direct result of ie, 4 (4.7%) children died and 9% of survivors had neurologic sequelae. attributable  in-hospital mortality was 4.7%. staphylococcus aureus was the most common organism, accounting for 26 episodes (30.6%). other notable pathogens included corynebacterium diphtheriae (10 cases, 11.8%) and streptococcus pyogenes (7 cases, 8.2%). in 6 episodes, the microbiologic diagnosis was made by 16s ribosomal rna testing of excised cardiac tissue. conclusions: congenital heart disease was the major risk factor for ie; however, rheumatic heart disease is also an important risk factor in new zealand, with implications for local endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations. in addition to a high burden of healthcare-associated and staphylococcal ie, pathogens such as c. diphtheriae and s. pyogenes occurred. 16s ribosomal rna testing is a useful tool to determine the etiologic agent in culture-negative ie.

TI  == reduction of biofilm formation on titanium surface with ultraviolet-c pre-irradiation.
AB  == purpose: ultraviolet-c irradiation on titanium implants has been recently introduced as photofunctionalization to enhance osseointegration, which possibly  also provide anti-microbial function to titanium surface as with photocatalyst. the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of ultraviolet-c pre-irradiation to various topographical titanium surfaces on the attachment or biofilm formation of wound pathogens in comparison with that of ultraviolet-a pre-irradiation, with consideration for the physicochemical mechanism. materials  and methods: the amount of wound pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes on titanium disks with mirror-polished, turned, acid-etched, or shot-blasted surfaces with or without 500 j/cm2 ultraviolet-a or  ultraviolet-c pre-irradiation for 8 h incubation in brain heart infusion broth was evaluated by fluorescence microscopic quantification with 5-cyano-2, 3-ditolyl-2 h-tetrazolium chloride staining for viable bacteria. the surface roughness, wettability, and atomic composition of the surface were evaluated before and after ultraviolet-a or ultraviolet-c irradiation. results: regardless  of topographies, the amount of bacterial attachment and accumulation was lower on ultraviolet-c pre-irradiated surfaces than on the non-irradiated surface through  8 h incubation. the reducing effect of bacterial accumulation on the roughened surfaces by ultraviolet-a pre-irradiation was inferior to that by ultraviolet-c.  despite no effect on surface topography, ultraviolet-c irradiation changed wettability to superhydrophilicity and reduced carbon contents on any titanium surface with a greater degree than those by ultraviolet-a irradiation. conclusion: ultraviolet-c irradiation reduced the attachment and biofilm formation of wound pathogens on various topographical titanium surfaces, rivaling or surpassing uva irradiation in degree. the mechanism might involve superhydrophilicity and carbon elimination on the surface.

TI  == [antibiotherapy of severe ent infections in children: complicated sinusitis].
AB  == intra or extra orbital cellulitis or abscesses are the most frequent bacterial complications of acute sinusitis. streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus (sa), and anaerobic bacteria are predominant, and more rarelyhaemophilus influenzae (especially since vaccination against type b).  because of bacterial sensitivity, pk/pd parameters of antibiotics, and depending  on the classification of chandler, different probabilistic regimens may be proposed: in class 1 by chandler (preseptal cellulitis), amoxicillinclavulinate (80 mg/kg/d) in 2 oral doses, and ceftriaxone in intramuscular injection; in cases of class 2 to 5 by chandler, high doses of intravenous amoxicillin-clavulinate (until 150 mg/kg/d of amoxicillin), or intravenous association of ceftriaxone (100 mg/kg/d) or cefotaxim (200 mg/kg/d), with anti-anaerobic like metronidazole (30 mg/kg/d) or clindamycine (40 mg/kg/d).

TI  == [antibiotherapy of severe ent infections in children: propositions of the french  group of pediatric infectious diseases (pid) of the french society of pediatrics].
AB  == the french group of pediatric infectious diseases (pid) of the french society of  pediatrics found necessary to issue in 2011 therapeutic proposals concerning antibiotic treatment in severe ent infections in children (acute mastoiditis, severe sinusitis, peripharyngeal abscess). they took into account, for each clinical situation, published studies and existing guidelines, the most frequently encountered bacterial species, their usual sensitivity to antibiotics, their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (pk-pd) characteristics. these propositions aim to ensure the proper use of antibiotics and to limit the development of bacterial resistance to antibiotics by minimizing the use of broadspectrum molecules, especially cephalosporins and penems. these infections are often multi microbial and respond to aerobic flora similar to that found in non severe community acquired ent infections and soft tissue infections ( streptococcus pyogenes or group a streptococcus(gas), streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae). anaerobic flora may be associated and implicated in some situations. in most cases, high-dosage of amoxicillin +/- clavulanic acid offers the best pk/pd profile and allows to avoid the overuse of injectable third-generation cephalosporins.

TI  == crystal structure of pfba, a surface adhesin of streptococcus pneumoniae, provides hints into its interaction with fibronectin.
AB  == pfba is a surface adhesin and invasin of streptococcus pneumoniae that binds to human fibronectin and plasminogen of the host extracellular matrix. it is a virulence factor for its pathogenesis. the crystal structure of recombinant pfba150-607 from s. pneumoniae strain r6, was determined using multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (mad) method and refined to 1.90a resolution. the structure  of rpfba150-607 revealed that residues thr150 to lys570 form a rigid parallel beta helix, followed by a short disordered region (571-607) that consists of beta hairpins. the structural organization of the beta helix resembles that of polysaccharide-modifying enzymes. the structural and sequence features essential  for fibronectin-binding observed in the well characterized fibronectin-binding proteins such as fnbpa of staphylococcus aureus, sfbi of streptococcus pyogenes and bbk32 of borrelia burgdorferi has been found in rpfba150-607. based on this,  it is predicted that the disordered region following the beta helix could be the  fibronectin-binding region in pfba. pfba150-607 contains relatively high number of surface exposed lysines and these residues are probably involved in binding plasmin(ogen) as observed in other plasminogen-binding proteins.

TI  == manuka honey inhibits adhesion and invasion of medically important wound bacteria in vitro.
AB  == aim: to characterize the effect of manuka honey on medically important wound bacteria in vitro, focusing on its antiadhesive properties. materials & methods:  crystal violet biofilm assays, fluorescent microscopy, protein adhesion assay and gentamicin protection assay were used to determine the impact of manuka honey on  biofilm formation, human protein binding and adherence to/invasion into human keratinocytes. results: manuka honey effectively disrupted and caused extensive cell death in biofilms of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pyogenes. sublethal doses of manuka honey inhibited bacterial adhesion to the fibronectin, fibrinogen and collagen. manuka honey impaired adhesion of laboratory and clinical isolates of s. aureus, p. aeruginosa and s. pyogenes to human keratinocytes in vitro, and inhibited invasion by s. pyogenes and homogeneous vancomycin intermediate s. aureus. conclusion: manuka honey can directly affect bacterial cells embedded in a biofilm and exhibits antiadhesive properties against three common wound pathogens.

TI  == the contribution of group a streptococcal virulence determinants to the pathogenesis of sepsis.
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus, gas) is responsible for a wide range of pathologies ranging from mild pharyngitis and impetigo to severe invasive soft tissue infections. despite the continuing susceptibility of the bacterium to beta-lactam antibiotics there has been an unexplained resurgence in  the prevalence of invasive gas infection over the past 30 years. of particular importance was the emergence of a gas-associated sepsis syndrome that is analogous to the systemic toxicosis associated with tsst-1 producing strains of staphylococcus aureus. despite being recognized for over 20 years, the etiology of gas associated sepsis and the streptococcal toxic shock syndrome remains poorly understood. here we review the virulence factors that contribute to the etiology of gas associated sepsis with a particular focus on coagulation system interactions and the role of the superantigens in the development of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == new non-alcoholic formulation for hand disinfection.
AB  == hand washing is considered as the single most important strategy to prevent infections. world health organization (who) defines hand hygiene as a primary issue of personal care with particular reference to hospital personnel and health facility workers. in this work, we investigated a new combination for hand disinfection as an alternative to alcohol-based and chlorhexidine products. the new combination of 5-pyrrolidone-2-carboxylic acid (pca) and copper sulphate pentahydrate (cs) was tested upon different bacterial species that normally colonize hands, including staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus  (mr s. aureus), staphylococcus epidermidis, multidrug resistant s. epidermidis (mdr s. epidermidis), streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, candida albicans and three clinical isolates: mr s. aureus, mdr s. epidermidis, and an e. coli strain. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics),  minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs), fractional inhibitory concentration (fic) indices, and fractional bactericidal concentration (fbc) indices were evaluated. ethanol 70% v/v, isopropanol 60% v/v, and 4% w/v chlorhexidine solution were used as reference hand disinfectants. copper sulphate pentahydrate  was very effective against all tested microorganisms: the mic and mbc for cs ranged from 781 mg/l against s. pyogenes to 12500 mg/l against e. coli strains and c. albicans. in addition, pca exhibited a good antimicrobial activity, in particular, against s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae. the combination of cs and pca  showed a strong synergistic effect and all fic indices were </=0.500. the combination of cs and pca were more effective than ethanol 70% v/v and isopropanol 60% v/v. in addition to antimicrobial activity, the new formulation possesses peculiar features such as residual activity and moisturizing effect. this work identifies a new strategy for hand disinfection.

TI  == retrospective analysis of antimicrobial resistance and bacterial spectrum of infection in gabon, central africa.
AB  == background: physicians depend on reliable information on the local epidemiology of infection and antibiotic resistance rates to guide empiric treatment in critically ill patients. as these data are scarce for central africa, we performed a retrospective analysis of microbiological findings from a secondary care hospital in gabon. methods: microbiological reports from 2009 to 2012 were used to assess the non-susceptibility rates of the three most common isolates from six major types of infections (bloodstream, ear-eye-nose-throat, surgical site, skin and soft tissue, urinary tract and wound infection). results: a high diversity of pathogens was found, but staphylococcus aureus was predominant in the majority of infections. overall, the three most prevalent pathogens in children were s. aureus (33.7%), streptococcus pyogenes (8.1%) and escherichia coli (4.5%) and in adults s. aureus (23.5%), e. coli (15.1%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (7.4%). in total, 5.8% (n = 19) of all s. aureus isolates were methicillin resistant. the proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)  producing enterobacteriaceae was 15.4% (n = 78), 49.4% of all k. pneumoniae were  esbl-producer (n = 42). conclusion: the high diversity of potential pathogens and high resistance rates in gram-negative bacteria challenge a rational empiric use  of antibiotics. countrywide continuous sentinel surveillance is therefore urgently needed.

TI  == a role for the dtxr family of metalloregulators in gram-positive pathogenesis.
AB  == given the central role of transition metal ions in a variety of biochemical processes, the colonization, survival, and proliferation of a bacterium within a  host hinges upon its ability to overcome the metal ion deprivation that characterizes nutritional immunity. metalloregulatory, or 'metal-sensing' proteins have evolved in bacteria to mediate metal ion homeostasis by activating  or repressing the expression of genes encoding metal ion transport systems upon binding their cognate metal ion. yet increasing evidence in the literature supports an additional role for these metalloregulatory proteins in pathogenesis. herein, we survey studies on the dtxr family of metalloregulators, namely dtxr (cornyebacterium diphtheriae), slor (streptococcus mutans), mtsr (streptococcus pyogenes), and mntr (staphylococcus aureus) to describe how metalloregulation enables adaptive virulence gene expression within the mammalian host. this research has important implications for drug design, as the generation of hyper-repressive metalloregulatory proteins may represent a mechanism by which to attenuate bacterial pathogenicity. the fact that metalloregulators are unique to  prokaryotes makes these proteins especially attractive therapeutic targets.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of propolis special extract gh 2002 against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates.
AB  == the need to discover and develop alternative therapies to treat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections is timely. the aim of this study was to  examine the antimicrobial potential of propolis, as a purified and concentrated special extract gh 2002, against clinical isolates of streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-resistent stapylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) and candida. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics)  and minimal microbicidial concentrations (mmcs) of propolis against microbial pathogens were evaluated using the broth microdilution method. propolis extract gh 2002 revealed low mics in the range of 0.03 to 2 mg/ml against s. pyogenes, s. aureus, e. faecium and candida. a high bactericidal activity of propolis extract  in the range of 0.06 to 1.0 mg/ml was determined for s. pyogenes and s. aureus, however propolis was not bactericidal against e. faecium. propolis concentrations between 0.6 and 2.4 mg/ml displayed fungicidal activity against different candida species. whereas all tested mrsa strains were highly susceptible against propolis, only minor activity was found against vre strains. time-kill curves demonstrated a high antimicrobial activity at low mics already after few hours of incubation against reference strains, clinical antibiotic-susceptible strains, clinical antifungal susceptible strains as well as all tested clinical mrsa strains, but not against vre strains. in conclusion, clinical drug-sensitive as well as some clinical multidrug-resistant microbial isolates, i.e. mrsa, were susceptible to propolis with different degrees of susceptibility. these results suggest that the special propolis extract gh2002 might be used in the development of alternative products for therapy of microbial infections.

TI  == impact of bacteria and bacterial components on osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells.
AB  == adult mesenchymal stem cells (msc) are present in several tissues, e.g. bone marrow, heart muscle, brain and subcutaneous adipose tissue. in invasive infections msc get in contact with bacteria and bacterial components. not much is known about how bacterial pathogens interact with msc and how contact to bacteria influences msc viability and differentiation potential. in this study we investigated the impact of three different wound infection relevant bacteria, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pyogenes, and the cell wall components lipopolysaccharide (lps; gram-negative bacteria) and lipoteichoic acid (lta; gram-positive bacteria) on viability, proliferation, and osteogenic as well as adipogenic differentiation of human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (admsc). we show that all three tested species were able to attach to  and internalize into admsc. the heat-inactivated gram-negative e. coli as well as lps were able to induce proliferation and osteogenic differentiation but reduce adipogenic differentiation of admsc. conspicuously, the heat-inactivated gram-positive species showed the same effects on proliferation and adipogenic differentiation, while its cell wall component lta exhibited no significant impact on admsc. therefore, our data demonstrate that osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of admsc is influenced in an oppositional fashion by bacterial antigens and that msc-governed regeneration is not necessarily reduced under infectious conditions.

AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 canadian hospitals from january 2010 to december 2012. in total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method (document m07-a9, 2012), with mics interpreted by using clsi breakpoints (document m100-s23, 2013). ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (mic90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, c. freundii, and h. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to clsi mic interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (p. mirabilis) to 54.0% (s. marcescens). all isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (mic90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity  against staphylococci or streptococci. all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.03 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and streptococcus agalactiae (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. we conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to  third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing e. coli and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.

AB  == gram-positive bacteria cause serious human illnesses through combinations of cell surface and secreted virulence factors. we initiated studies with four of these organisms to develop novel topical antibacterial agents that interfere with growth and exotoxin production, focusing on menaquinone analogs. menadione, 1,4-naphthoquinone, and coenzymes q1 to q3 but not menaquinone, phylloquinone, or coenzyme q10 inhibited the growth and to a greater extent exotoxin production of  staphylococcus aureus, bacillus anthracis, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus agalactiae at concentrations of 10 to 200 mug/ml. coenzyme q1 reduced the ability of s. aureus to cause toxic shock syndrome in a rabbit model, inhibited the growth of four gram-negative bacteria, and synergized with another  antimicrobial agent, glycerol monolaurate, to inhibit s. aureus growth. the staphylococcal two-component system srra/b was shown to be an antibacterial target of coenzyme q1. we hypothesize that menaquinone analogs both induce toxic  reactive oxygen species and affect bacterial plasma membranes and biosynthetic machinery to interfere with two-component systems, respiration, and macromolecular synthesis. these compounds represent a novel class of potential topical therapeutic agents.

AB  == monocyte/macrophage cells from human nasopharyngeal lymphoid tissue can be a source of bacteria responsible for human chronic and recurrent upper respiratory  tract infection. detection and characterization of pathogens surviving intracellularly could be a key element in bacteriological diagnosis of the infections as well as in the study on interactions between bacteria and their host. the present study was undertaken to assess the possibility of isolation of  viable bacteria from the cells expressing monocyte/macrophage marker cd14 in nasopharyngeal lymphoid tissue. overall, 74 adenotonsillectomy specimens (adenoids and tonsils) from 37 children with adenoid hypertrophy and recurrent infections as well as 15 specimens from nine children with adenoid hypertrophy, which do not suffer from upper respiratory tract infections (the control group),  were studied. the suitability of immunomagnetic separation for extraction of cd14(+) cells from lymphoid tissue and for further isolation of the intracellular pathogens has been shown. the coexistence of living pathogens including haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pyogenes with the bacteria representing normal nasopharyngeal microbiota inside cd14(+) cells was demonstrated. twenty-four strains of these pathogens from 32.4 % of the lysates of cd14(+) cells were isolated. concurrently, the fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) with a universal eub388, and the species-specific probes demonstrated twice more often the persistence of these bacterial species in the lysates of cd14(+) cells than conventional culture. although the fish technique appears to be more sensitive than traditional culture in the intracellular bacteria identification, the doubts on whether the bacteria are alive, and therefore, pathogenic would still exist without the strain cultivation.

TI  == the thioredoxin antioxidant system.
AB  == the thioredoxin (trx) system, which is composed of nadph, thioredoxin reductase (trxr), and thioredoxin, is a key antioxidant system in defense against oxidative stress through its disulfide reductase activity regulating protein dithiol/disulfide balance. the trx system provides the electrons to thiol-dependent peroxidases (peroxiredoxins) to remove reactive oxygen and nitrogen species with a fast reaction rate. trx antioxidant functions are also shown by involvement in dna and protein repair by reducing ribonucleotide reductase, methionine sulfoxide reductases, and regulating the activity of many redox-sensitive transcription factors. moreover, trx systems play critical roles  in the immune response, virus infection, and cell death via interaction with thioredoxin-interacting protein. in mammalian cells, the cytosolic and mitochondrial trx systems, in which trxrs are high molecular weight selenoenzymes, together with the glutathione-glutaredoxin (grx) system (nadph, glutathione reductase, gsh, and grx) control the cellular redox environment. recently mammalian thioredoxin and glutathione systems have been found to be able to provide the electrons crossly and to serve as a backup system for each other.  in contrast, bacteria trxrs are low molecular weight enzymes with a structure and reaction mechanism distinct from mammalian trxr. many bacterial species possess specific thiol-dependent antioxidant systems, and the significance of the trx system in the defense against oxidative stress is different. particularly, the absence of a gsh-grx system in some pathogenic bacteria such as helicobacter pylori, mycobacterium tuberculosis, and staphylococcus aureus makes the bacterial trx system essential for survival under oxidative stress. this provides an opportunity to kill these bacteria by targeting the trxr-trx system.

TI  == streptococcal vertebral osteomyelitis: multiple faces of the same disease.
AB  == the role of streptococcus species as an aetiological microorganism of vertebral osteomyelitis (vo) is considered to be of little relevance. we aimed to describe  a large number of cases of streptococcal vertebral osteomyelitis (svo), to analyze the clinical features associated with different streptococcus species, and to compare them with a cohort of patients with vo caused by staphylococcus aureus. an incidence study and a retrospective, multicenter, observational clinical study of cases of svo (1991-2011) were performed. statistical comparison of svo by different species and between them and staphylococcal vo was carried out. over the whole period there was an increasing incidence in the number of vos and svos per year (p <0.05). among 58 cases of svo, those caused by non-viridans  streptococcus (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pyogenes; n = 26) mimicked vo by s. aureus, and presented with more fever, neurological symptoms and paravertebral abscesses in comparison with those caused by the viridans group (remaining species). in contrast, the latter have a  sub-acute clinical picture and were associated with the presence of endocarditis  (p <0.05). among non-viridans svos, concomitant infection was specifically related to s. pneumoniae (p <0.05). in conclusion, svo presents a wide range of clinical patterns. the relationship between vo and diagnosis of endocarditis was  established with svo caused by the viridans group. whereas non-viridans svo mimics acute characteristics of vo caused by s. aureus, cases of viridans svo are significantly more likely to have a sub-acute clinical presentation. the increased incidence of svo during the last decades could support a new epidemiological scenario.

TI  == combination of pantothenamides with vanin inhibitors as a novel antibiotic strategy against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the emergence of resistance against current antibiotics calls for the development of new compounds to treat infectious diseases. synthetic pantothenamides are pantothenate analogs that possess broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro  in minimal media. pantothenamides were shown to be substrates of the bacterial coenzyme a (coa) biosynthetic pathway, causing cellular coa depletion and interference with fatty acid synthesis. in spite of their potential use and selectivity for bacterial metabolic routes, these compounds have never made it to the clinic. in the present study, we show that pantothenamides are not active as  antibiotics in the presence of serum, and we found that they were hydrolyzed by ubiquitous pantetheinases of the vanin family. to address this further, we synthesized a series of pantetheinase inhibitors based on a pantothenate scaffold that inhibited serum pantetheinase activity in the nanomolar range. mass spectrometric analysis showed that addition of these pantetheinase inhibitors prevented hydrolysis of pantothenamides by serum. we found that combinations of these novel pantetheinase inhibitors and prototypic pantothenamides like n5-pan and n7-pan exerted antimicrobial activity in vitro, particularly against gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes) even in the presence of serum. these results indicate that pantothenamides, when protected against degradation by host pantetheinases, are potentially useful antimicrobial agents.

TI  == antibacterial activity of actinomycetes isolated from different soil samples of sheopur (a city of central india).
AB  == the main objective of the present study was isolation, purification, and characterization of actinomycetes from soil samples, having antimicrobial activity against 12 selected pathogenic strains. soils samples were taken from different niche habitats of sheopur district, madhya pradesh, india. these samples were serially diluted and plated on actinomycete isolation agar media. potential colonies were screened, purified, and stored in glycerol stock. isolates were morphologically and biochemically characterized. these isolates were subjected to extraction for production of the antibacterial compound. antibacterial activity and minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the purified extract of isolates were evaluated. totally 31 actinomycete isolates were tested  for antagonistic activity against 12 pathogenic microorganisms. isolates as14, as27, and as28 were highly active, while as1 showed less activity against the pathogenic microorganisms. isolate as7 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity against bacillus cereus (24 mm) and as16 showed the highest activity against enterococcus faecalis (21 mm). mic was also determined for actinomycete isolates against all the tested microorganisms. mic of actinomycete isolates was  found to be 2.5 mg/ml against shigella dysenteriae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and klebsiella pneumoniae, and was 1.25 mg/ml for staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus xylosus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus. all actinomycetes isolates showed antibacterial activity against s. aureus, while they showed less activity against s. dysenteriae. these  isolates had antibacterial activity and could be used in the development of new antibiotics for pharmaceutical or agricultural purposes.

TI  == uptake and intracellular trafficking of superantigens in dendritic cells.
AB  == bacterial superantigens (sags) are exotoxins produced mainly by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes that can cause toxic shock syndrome (tss). according to current paradigm, sags interact directly and simultaneously with t cell receptor (tcr) on the t cell and mhc class ii (mhc-ii) on the antigen-presenting cell (apc), thereby circumventing intracellular processing to  trigger t cell activation. dendritic cells (dcs) are professional apcs that coat  nearly all body surfaces and are the most probable candidate to interact with sags. we demonstrate that sags are taken up by mouse dcs without triggering dc maturation. sags were found in intracellular acidic compartment of dcs as biologically active molecules. moreover, sags co-localized with eea1, rab-7 and lamp-2, at different times, and were then recycled to the cell membrane. dcs loaded with sags are capable of triggering in vitro lymphocyte proliferation and, injected into mice, stimulate t cells bearing the proper tcr in draining lymph nodes. transportation and trafficking of sags in dcs might increase the local concentration of these exotoxins where they will produce the highest effect by promoting their encounter with both mhc-ii and tcr in lymph nodes, and may explain how just a few sag molecules can induce the severe pathology associated with tss.

TI  == the effect of repeated episodes of bacteria-specific clinical mastitis on mortality and culling in holstein dairy cows.
AB  == the objective of this study was to estimate the effect of a first and repeated cases of bacteria-specific clinical mastitis (cm) on the risk of mortality and culling in holstein dairy cows. the pathogens studied were streptococcus spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus spp., escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., trueperella pyogenes, others, and no growth on aerobic culture. a total of 50,166 lactations were analyzed from 5 large, high-milk-producing dairy herds in new york state from 2003/2004 to 2011. generalized linear mixed models with a poisson error distribution were used to study the effects of parity, month of lactation,  cm, calving diseases, pregnancy status, current season, and economic values on the risk of mortality and culling. among first-lactation cows, the presence of a  first cm case generally exposed cows to a greater risk of mortality in the current month (compared with the absence of a first case). this was especially acute with a first case of klebsiella spp., where cows were 4.5 times more at risk [95% confidence interval (ci): 2.7-7.6] of mortality, and with a first case  of e. coli were 3.3 times more at risk (95% ci: 2.5-4.5). in first-parity cows, the risk of culling generally increased with a case of bacteria-specific cm. this was observed among cows with a first case of t. pyogenes [relative risk=10.4 (95% ci: 8.4-12.8)], a first case of klebsiella spp. [relative risk=6.7 (95% ci: 5.5-8.1)], a first case of staph. aureus [relative risk=4.8 (95% ci: 2.7-8.4)], a first case of e. coli [relative risk=3.1 (95% ci: 2.7-3.6)], and a third case of  klebsiella spp. [relative risk=5.0 (95% ci: 3.1-8.0)]. in general, the presence of a first or second/third case resulted in cows in parity >/=2 with a greater risk of mortality. this was greatest for cows with a first case of klebsiella spp. [relative risk=3.7 (95% ci: 3.3-4.3)], followed by a second/third case of klebsiella spp. [relative risk=3.2 (95% ci: 2.5-4.0)], a first case of e. coli [relative risk=3.0 (95% ci: 2.7-3.3)], and a first case of other cm [relative risk=1.8 (95% ci: 1.6-2.0)]. among cows of parity >/=2, the risk of culling was greater for cows as they progressed through lactations [i.e., cows in parity 4+ were 2.1 (95% ci: 2.0-2.2) times more likely to be culled compared with cows in lactation 2 (the baseline)]. the risk of culling dependent on the cow's characteristics can be easily calculated from the parameter estimates in the provided tables.

TI  == characterization of molecules binding to the 70k n-terminal region of fibronectin by ifast purification coupled with mass spectrometry.
AB  == fibronectin (fn) is a large glycoprotein present in plasma and extracellular matrix and is important for many processes. within fn the 70 kda n-terminal region (70k-fn) is involved in cell-mediated fn assembly, a process that contributes to embryogenesis, development, and platelet thrombus formation. in addition, major human pathogens including staphlycoccus aureus and streptococcus  pyogenes bind the 70k-fn region by a novel form of protein-protein interaction called beta-zipper formation, facilitating bacterial spread and colonization. knowledge of blood plasma and platelet proteins that interact with 70k-fn by beta-zipper formation is incomplete. in the current study, we aimed to characterize these proteins through affinity purification. for this affinity purification, we used a novel purification technique termed immiscible filtration assisted by surface tension (ifast). the foundation of this technology is immiscible phase filtration, using a magnet to draw paramagnetic particle (pmp)-bound analyte through an immiscible barrier (oil or organic solvent) that separates an aqueous sample from an aqueous eluting buffer. the immiscible barrier functions to remove unbound proteins via exclusion rather than dilutive washing used in traditional isolation methods. we identified 31 interactors from  plasma, of which only seven were previously known to interact with fn. furthermore, five proteins were identified to interact with 70k-fn from platelet  lysate, of which one was previously known. these results demonstrate that ifast offers advantages for proteomic studies of interacting molecules in that the technique requires small sample volumes, can be done with high enough throughput  to sample multiple interaction conditions, and is amenable to exploratory mass spectrometric and confirmatory immuno-blotting read-outs.

TI  == antibody to a conserved antigenic target is protective against diverse prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathogens.
AB  == microbial capsular antigens are effective vaccines but are chemically and immunologically diverse, resulting in a major barrier to their use against multiple pathogens. a beta-(1-->6)-linked poly-n-acetyl-d-glucosamine (pnag) surface capsule is synthesized by four proteins encoded in genetic loci designated intercellular adhesion in staphylococcus aureus or polyglucosamine in  selected gram-negative bacterial pathogens. we report that many microbial pathogens lacking an identifiable intercellular adhesion or polyglucosamine locus produce pnag, including gram-positive, gram-negative, and fungal pathogens, as well as protozoa, e.g., trichomonas vaginalis, plasmodium berghei, and sporozoites and blood-stage forms of plasmodium falciparum. natural antibody to pnag is common in humans and animals and binds primarily to the highly acetylated glycoform of pnag but is not protective against infection due to lack of deposition of complement opsonins. polyclonal animal antibody raised to deacetylated glycoforms of pnag and a fully human igg1 monoclonal antibody that both bind to native and deacetylated glycoforms of pnag mediated complement-dependent opsonic or bactericidal killing and protected mice against local and/or systemic infections by streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, listeria monocytogenes, neisseria meningitidis serogroup b, candida albicans, and p. berghei anka, and against colonic pathology in a model of infectious colitis. pnag is also a capsular polysaccharide for neisseria gonorrhoeae and nontypable hemophilus influenzae, and protects cells from environmental stress. vaccination targeting pnag could contribute to immunity against serious and diverse prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathogens, and the conserved production of pnag suggests that it is a critical factor in microbial biology.

TI  == identification of pathogens in mastitis milk samples with fluorescent in situ hybridization.
AB  == traditionally, the bacteriological examination of mastitis milk samples is performed by culture followed by biochemical tests on the cultured bacteria to allow identification of the causative pathogen. depending on the species involved, this classic identification is time-consuming compared to other techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish), a culture-independent method that utilizes oligonucleotides (labeled with a fluorophore) that are specific to a string of target dna/rna. in the current study, the applicability of fish was evaluated for the detection of mastitis pathogens directly in milk samples. to remove interfering lipids and proteins from mastitis milk samples prior to fish, a previously published enzymatic treatment with savinase was evaluated. fish was performed using oligonucleotides  specific for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, and trueperella (arcanobacterium) pyogenes. the enzymatic pretreatment and the sensitivity of fish were evaluated using spiked whole milk samples and mastitis milk samples with bacterial loads of less than 10(3) up to 10(8) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. bacteria were reliably detected in milk samples with bacterial numbers of 10(6) cfu/ml or higher. however, bacteria present in numbers below 10(6) cfu/ml were not detectable in all cases. the ability of fish to identify mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples, and therefore earlier than classical culture methods, can supplement the classic diagnostic procedures for mastitis milk samples.

TI  == comparison of three methods for the recovery of skin pathogens from impetigo swabs collected in a remote community of northern territory, australia.
AB  == background: impetigo is a common infection in children living in remote areas. immediate plating of impetigo swabs is the gold standard for bacterial recovery but is rarely feasible in remote regions. bacterial culture increases our understanding of antibiotic resistance and strain diversity, which guides treatment protocols and epidemiological monitoring. methods: we investigated three practical alternatives for recovering streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus from transported swabs: dry swabs transported at 4 degrees  c with desiccant and plated within 48 h; swabs inoculated into skim milk tryptone glucose glycerol broth (stggb), transported at 4 degrees c, stored at -70 degrees c and plated within 61 days; and eswabs inoculated into amies broth, transported  at 4 degrees c and plated within 48 h. detection of strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus from simultaneously collected swabs was compared for the dry vs stggb (36  sores) and the stggb vs amies (39 sores) methods. swabs were collected from 43 children (75 sores sampled) in a remote community of northern territory, australia in november 2011. the children had impetigo and were participating in the skin sore trial [australian clinical trials registry actrn12609000858291]. results: recovery of strep. pyogenes for dry vs stggb was 72% (26/36) and 92% (33/36) and for stggb vs amies was 92% (36/39) for both methods. staphylococcus aureus recovery for dry vs stggb was 69% (25/36) and 72% 26/36) and for stggb vs  amies was 74% (29/39) and 85% (33/39). conclusion: stggb and amies media provided higher recovery of strep. pyogenes than dry swabs. these results and the opportunity to batch and store specimens for molecular studies support the use of stggb transport media for future impetigo research.

TI  == endocarditis in adults with bacterial meningitis.
AB  == background: endocarditis may precede or complicate bacterial meningitis, but the  incidence and impact of endocarditis in bacterial meningitis are unknown. methods and results: we assessed the incidence and clinical characteristics of patients with meningitis and endocarditis from a nationwide cohort study of adults with community-acquired bacterial meningitis in the netherlands from 2006 to 2012. endocarditis was identified in 24 of 1025 episodes (2%) of bacterial meningitis.  cultures yielded streptococcus pneumoniae in 13 patients, staphylococcus aureus in 8 patients, and streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus salivarius in 1 patient each. clues leading to the diagnosis of endocarditis were cardiac murmurs, persistent or recurrent fever, a history of heart valve disease, and s aureus as the causative pathogen of bacterial meningitis. treatment consisted of prolonged antibiotic therapy in all patients and surgical valve replacement in 10 patients (42%). two patients were treated with oral anticoagulants, and both developed life-threatening intracerebral hemorrhage. systemic (70%) and neurological (54%) complications occurred frequently, leading to a high proportion of patients with unfavorable outcome (63%). seven of 24 patients (29%) with meningitis and endocarditis died. conclusions: endocarditis is an uncommon coexisting condition in bacterial meningitis but is associated with a high rate of unfavorable outcome.

TI  == novel bacteriophage lysin with broad lytic activity protects against mixed infection by streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus [gras]) cause serious and sometimes fatal human diseases.  they are among the many gram-positive pathogens for which resistance to leading antibiotics has emerged. as a result, alternative therapies need to be developed  to combat these pathogens. we have identified a novel bacteriophage lysin (plyss2), derived from a streptococcus suis phage, with broad lytic activity against mrsa, vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (visa), streptococcus suis, listeria, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus equi, streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus [gbs]), s. pyogenes, streptococcus sanguinis, group g streptococci (ggs), group e streptococci (ges),  and streptococcus pneumoniae. plyss2 has an n-terminal cysteine-histidine aminopeptidase (chap) catalytic domain and a c-terminal sh3b binding domain. it is stable at 50 degrees c for 30 min, 37 degrees c for >24 h, 4 degrees c for 15  days, and -80 degrees c for >7 months; it maintained full activity after 10 freeze-thaw cycles. plyss2 at 128 mug/ml in vitro reduced mrsa and s. pyogenes growth by 5 logs and 3 logs within 1 h, respectively, and exhibited a mic of 16 mug/ml for mrsa. a single, 2-mg dose of plyss2 protected 92% (22/24) of the mice  in a bacteremia model of mixed mrsa and s. pyogenes infection. serially increasing exposure of mrsa and s. pyogenes to plyss2 or mupirocin resulted in no observed resistance to plyss2 and resistance to mupirocin. to date, no other lysin has shown such notable broad lytic activity, stability, and efficacy against multiple, leading, human bacterial pathogens; as such, plyss2 has all the characteristics to be an effective therapeutic.

TI  == development and application of a multiplex pcr assay for rapid detection of 4 major bacterial pathogens in ducks.
AB  == infections with pasteurella multocida, salmonella enterica, riemerella anatipestifer, and escherichia coli result in high morbidity and mortality, which cause significant economic loss in the poultry industry. it can be difficult to distinguish these pathogens based on clinical signs because these pathogens can cause similar clinical signs and coinfections can occur. thus, rapid and sensitive detection of these 4 major bacterial pathogens are important in ducks.  the aim of this study was to develop a multiplex pcr (mpcr) assay for simultaneously detecting and identifying these 4 pathogenic bacteria in a single  tube reaction. the target genes used were kmt1 of p. multocida, the invasion protein gene of s. enterica, 16s rdna of r. anatipestifer, and the alkaline phosphatase gene of e. coli. the detection limit of the assay for all bacterial dna was 10 pg. the mpcr did not produce any nonspecific amplification products when tested against other related pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, clostridium perfringens, mycoplasma gallinarum, mycoplasma synoviae, and mycoplasma gallisepticum, which can also infect ducks. we applied mpcr to field samples, and the results were the same as the single pcr results. these results suggest that mpcr for the 4 bacteria is a useful and rapid technique to apply to field samples.

TI  == microbiological assessment of indoor air of a teaching hospital in nigeria.
AB  == objective: to investigate the quality of indoor air of different wards and units  of olabisi onabanjo university teaching hospital, sagamu, to ascertain their contribution to infection rate in the hospital. methods: the microbial quality of indoor air of nine wards/units of olabisi onabanjo university teaching hospital,  sagamu, nigeria was conducted. sedimentation technique using open petri-dishes containing different culture media was employed and samplings were done twice daily, one in the morning shortly after cleaning and before influx of people/patients into the wards/units and the other in the evening when a lot of activities would have taken place in these wards. isolates were identified according to standard methods. results: results showed that there was a statistically significant difference (chi(2) = 6.016 7) in the bacteria population of the different sampling time whereas it was not so for fungi population (chi(2) = 0.285 7). male medical ward (mmw) and male surgical general  (msg) recorded the highest bacterial and fungal growth while the operating theatre (ot) was almost free of microbial burden. the bacteria isolates were staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella sp., bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes and serratia marscences while the fungi isolates included  aspergillus flavus, penicillium sp., fusarium sp., candida albicans and alternaria sp. staphylococcus aureus was the predominantly isolated bacterium while penicillium sp. was the most isolated fungus. conclusions: though most of the microbial isolates were potential and or opportunistic pathogens, there was no correlation between the isolates in this study and the surveillance report of  nosocomial infection during the period of study, hence the contribution of the indoor air cannot be established. from the reduction noticed in the morning samples, stringent measures such as proper disinfection and regular cleaning, restriction of patient relatives' movement in and out of the wards/units need to  be enforced so as to improve the quality of indoor air of our hospital wards/units.

TI  == milk haptoglobin, milk amyloid a, and n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase activity in bovines with naturally occurring clinical mastitis diagnosed with a quantitative  pcr test.
AB  == the associations between quantitative bacteriological results from a real-time pcr test and concentrations of acute-phase proteins (app) and n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (nagase) activity in milk in naturally occurring  clinical mastitis were investigated. milk app concentrations and nagase activity  in clinical mastitis caused by different udder pathogens were studied. the associations between the severity of the clinical signs and concentrations of app and nagase activity were estimated. milk samples from 281 cases of clinical mastitis were collected from 3 estonian dairy farms and analyzed by pcr to identify pathogens. twenty-seven samples out of 281 (9.6%) were pcr negative. milk samples containing 4 or more bacterial species (n=28) were considered possibly contaminated and excluded from all further analyses. in total, 443 bacterial identifications were made from the remaining 226 milk samples. a single bacterial species was detected in 68 samples (30.1%), 2 species were detected in  99 samples (43.8%), and 3 species were detected in 59 (26.1%) samples. to determine the inflammatory response in the udder, the concentrations of milk amyloid a (maa) and haptoglobin (hp) and nagase activity in the milk were analyzed. a significant positive association was found between the severity of the clinical signs and inflammatory markers in the milk. milk amyloid a and hp concentrations and nagase activity were significantly higher in samples with large quantities of bacterial dna from escherichia coli or streptococcus dysgalactiae compared with milk samples not containing those species. large quantities of bacterial dna from trueperella pyogenes or streptococcus uberis in  the milk were associated with elevated concentrations of hp and high nagase activity, but not with increased maa concentrations. milk samples containing corynebacterium bovis and coagulase-negative staphylococci had significantly lower concentrations of maa and hp and lower nagase activity compared with samples where these species were not detected. it can be concluded that concentrations of app and nagase activity in the milk were associated with the quantity of bacterial dna in the milk samples.

TI  == antibacterial performance of nanoscaled visible-light responsive platinum-containing titania photocatalyst in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == background: traditional antibacterial photocatalysts are primarily induced by ultraviolet light to elicit antibacterial reactive oxygen species. new generation visible-light responsive photocatalysts were discovered, offering greater opportunity to use photocatalysts as disinfectants in our living environment. recently, we found that visible-light responsive platinum-containing titania (tio2-pt) exerted high performance antibacterial property against soil-borne pathogens even in soil highly contaminated water. however, its physical and photocatalytic properties, and the application in vivo have not been well-characterized. methods: transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive  spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, ultraviolet-visible absorption spectrum and the removal rate of nitrogen oxides were therefore analyzed. the antibacterial performance under in vitro and in vivo conditions was evaluated. results: the apparent quantum efficiency for visible light illuminated tio2-pt is relatively higher than several other titania photocatalysts. the killing effect achieved approximately 2 log reductions of pathogenic bacteria in vitro. illumination of injected tio2-pt successfully ameliorated the subcutaneous infection in mice. conclusions: this is the first demonstration of in vivo antibacterial use of tio2-pt nanoparticles. when compared to nanoparticles of some other visible-light responsive photocatalysts,  tio2-pt nanoparticles induced less adverse effects such as exacerbated platelet clearance and hepatic cytotoxicity in vivo. general significance: these findings  suggest that the tio2-pt may have potential application on the development of an  antibacterial material in both in vitro and in vivo settings.

TI  == contemporary potencies of minocycline and tetracycline hcl tested against gram-positive pathogens: sentry program results using clsi and eucast breakpoint  criteria.
AB  == tetracycline class agents vary widely in their activity against emerging important antimicrobial-resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and acinetobacter spp. also, published susceptibility breakpoints are discordant between the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi), the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast), and regulatory-approved documents. we have assessed the impact of these differences for tetracycline hcl and minocycline when tested against contemporary gram-positive pathogens. the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (2011) compared minocycline and tetracycline hcl activity via reference methods (m07-a9) using a worldwide collection of s. aureus (sa; 4917 strains with 1955 mrsa), streptococcus pneumoniae (spn; 1899), s. pyogenes (gra; 246), and s. agalactiae (grb; 217). regardless of applied categorical breakpoints, minocycline exhibited wider coverage (% susceptible) than tetracycline hcl of 4.5-11.8/0.5-2.6/1.4-2.3/0.4-0.4% for mrsa/spn/grb/gra,  respectively. lower eucast susceptible breakpoints produced reduced susceptibility rates for minocycline ranging from no difference (</=0.5 mug/ml) for gra to -8.9% (</=1 mug/ml) for mrsa (97.2% susceptible by clsi; 88.3% by eucast). use of tetracycline hcl-susceptible results to predict minocycline susceptibility was very accurate (99.0-100.0%), with absolute categorical agreement rates ranging from 92.1% to 98.4% (clsi) to 98.4% to 99.6% (eucast) for streptococci; greatest predictive error was noted using the clsi breakpoints (14.7%) compared to eucast criteria (only 5.0%; acceptable), both for mrsa testing dominated by false-resistant results for minocycline. in conclusion, minocycline demonstrates continued superior in vitro activity compared to tetracycline hcl when testing sa (especially mrsa) and pathogenic streptococci. when testing tetracyclines, laboratories must recognize the expanded spectrum of  minocycline against certain pathogens and utilize methods minimizing interpretive error. we conclude that eucast breakpoint criteria (</=0.5 or </=1 mug/ml) represent the most conservative (better recognize strains with tet resistance mechanisms) and accurate tetracycline breakpoint guidelines for testing contemporary isolates of gram-positive cocci.

TI  == a peptide antagonist of cd28 signaling attenuates toxic shock and necrotizing soft-tissue infection induced by streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus and group a streptococcus pyogenes (gas) express superantigen (sag) exotoxin proteins capable of inducing lethal shock. to induce  toxicity, sags must bind not only to the major histocompatibility complex ii molecule of antigen-presenting cells and the variable beta chain of the t-cell receptor but also to the dimer interface of the t-cell costimulatory receptor cd28. here, we show that the cd28-mimetic peptide ab103 (originally designated "p2ta") protects mice from lethal challenge with streptococcal exotoxin a, as well as from lethal gas bacterial infection in a murine model of necrotizing soft-tissue infection. administration of a single dose of ab103 increased survival when given up to 5 hours after infection, reduced inflammatory cytokine  expression and bacterial burden at the site of infection, and improved muscle inflammation in a dose-dependent manner, without compromising cellular and humoral immunity. thus, ab103 merits further investigation as a potential therapeutic in sag-mediated necrotizing soft-tissue infection.

AB  == importance: acellular dermal matrices have many current and potential applications, but their long-term safety has not been extensively studied. in particular, limited information exists regarding such materials' resistance to infection. objective: to assess the resistance to microbial penetration of common acellular dermal matrix materials used in reconstruction after skin cancer excision, treatment of chronic ulcers and burns, breast reconstruction, hernia repairs, and other applications. design: comparative in vitro study of 4 commercially available dermal substitutes for their ability to act as barriers to penetration by common skin pathogens. setting: university-based dermatology and plastic surgery departments and a hospital microbiology laboratory. materials: four commercially available dermal substitutes, including alloderm (lifecell), flexhd (musculoskeletal transplant foundation), strattice (lifecell), and neoform (mentor corporation). intervention: we tested the 4 dermal matrix materials with  the following 4 organisms commonly implicated in wound infections: staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pyogenes, and candida albicans. each material was inoculated with the same concentration of each pathogen. main outcome measure: the number of bacterial colonies grown on blood agar plates. results: alloderm and rehydrated flexhd were found to be the best barriers to penetration by p. aeruginosa. alloderm, flexhd, and strattice also prevented penetration by s. aureus and s. pyogenes; neoform was less effective in withstanding these organisms. the results of this study were inconclusive with regard to c. albicans penetration. conclusions and relevance: three of the 4 commonly used acellular dermal matrix materials are resistant to in vitro penetration by s. aureus and s. pyogenes and partially resistant to p. aeruginosa. resistance to fungal pathogens is uncertain. antimicrobial differences across matrix materials may influence their selection for particular  uses, such as treatment of refractory leg ulcers or reconstruction after skin cancer excision.

TI  == burden of paediatric pyoderma and scabies in north west queensland.
AB  == aim: the study aims to assess the health burden of children admitted with 'scabies' to mt isa hospital, the referral centre for north west queensland, from 2006 to 2010. methods: this is a retrospective chart audit of admissions of children with 'scabies' including age, sex, date, residence, indigenous status, result of skin swabs and length of stay, and the number of admissions with acute  rheumatic fever (arf) and acute post-streptococcal glomerulo-nephritis (apsgn) in that period. financial burden was estimated from daily bed costs and transportation. results: there were 113 admissions with mean age of 23/12: 11% were <2/12 and mean stay was 4.5 days. 19 were admitted twice, 5 thrice and 2 four times. 7 individuals accounted for 25% of admissions. 'scabies' accounted for 10.1% of medical admissions <5 years of age. admissions increased from 10 in  2005 to 39 in 2010. the minimum cost per admission was $9584.07. seventy-one per  cent of swabs grew group a streptococcus, all sensitive to penicillin. sixty-three per cent of these were accompanied by staphylococcus aureus, which was the sole organism in 18%. sixty-four per cent of s. aureus were methicillin resistant. there were 29 admissions for arf and 23 with apsgn. all children with  'scabies' and arf and all but three with apsgn were indigenous. conclusion: pyoderma and scabies are major health burdens in north west queensland, requiring organised community-based prevention. the number of repeat admissions emphasises  the futility of individual treatment.

TI  == emergence of methicillin-resistant, vancomycin-intermediate staphylococcus aureus among patients associated with group a streptococcal pharyngitis infection in southern india.
AB  == beyond staphylococcus aureus being an etiological agent for several serious clinical complications, the foot prints of s. aureus in pharyngitis infection has also been recently recognized. with due response to the fact, a prospective study was conducted between 2009 and 2010 to describe the molecular epidemiology of s.  aureus in throat swabs of pharyngitis patients. a total of 63 methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and 102 methicillin-susceptible s. aureus  (mssa) isolates were recovered from 265 throat swabs, representing a community-acquired outpatient population from tamil nadu, india. molecular characterization of mrsa was done by two conventional multiplex pcr assays including panton-valentine leukocidin (pvl), meca and nuc genes, and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (sccmec) typing. among 165 s. aureus isolates, methicillin resistance was observed in 38.2% (n=63), in which 69.8% (n=44/63) of the mrsa along with 55.9% (n=57/102) of mssa harbored pvl toxin genes. sccmec typing showed 50.8% of isolates as sccmec v (n=32), 44.4% as sccmec iii (n=28), and 1.6% as sccmec types i, ii and iva (n=1). multilocus sequence typing performed for 26 selected mrsa isolates resulted in 12 different sequence  types (st), including a novel st2129/sccmec iii, pvl-positive. ten mrsa isolates  were categorized as st772 (38.5%)/sccmec v, pvl-positive, and three isolates as st368 (11.5%)/sccmec iii, pvl-negative. though the prominent clones of st772/sccmec v were multidrug-susceptible worldwide, they were highly multidrug-resistant in the current study, including four clones intermediate to vancomycin. totally, 10 (15.9%) out of 63 mrsa isolates were documented as vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (visa). collectively, the present study for the first time portrayed the high prevalence of active mrsa pharyngitis infection and also emphasizes an alarming need for discrimination of pharyngeal-asymptomatic carriers of s. aureus from those with an active s. aureus pharyngitis infection.

TI  == bacterial coinfection in influenza: a grand rounds review.
AB  == bacterial coinfection complicated nearly all influenza deaths in the 1918 influenza pandemic and up to 34% of 2009 pandemic influenza a(h1n1) infections managed in intensive care units worldwide. more than 65,000 deaths attributable to influenza and pneumonia occur annually in the united states. data from 683 critically ill patients with 2009 pandemic influenza a(h1n1) infection admitted to 35 intensive care units in the united states reveal that bacterial coinfection commonly occurs within the first 6 days of influenza infection, presents similarly to influenza infection occurring alone, and is associated with an increased risk of death. pathogens that colonize the nasopharynx, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes, are  most commonly isolated. complex viral, bacterial, and host factors contribute to  the pathogenesis of coinfection. reductions in morbidity and mortality are dependent on prevention with available vaccines as well as early diagnosis and treatment.

TI  == the mutated staphylococcal h35a alpha-toxin inhibits adhesion and invasion of staphylococcus aureus and group a streptococci.
AB  == in previous studies we demonstrated that the staphylococcal alpha-toxin inhibits  adhesion and invasion of s. aureus by epithelial cells through binding to alpha5beta1 integrin, a receptor of fibronectin. moreover, we revealed that a h35a mutation abolishes the cytotoxicity of alpha-toxin completely. these findings led us to hypothesize that the h35a mutated alpha-toxin may be explored  as a potential inhibitor for bacterial adhesion and invasion of epithelial cells. in this study, we examined the impact of the h35a alpha-toxin on staphylococcal capacity of adhering to and invading into epithelial cells and found that the addition of h35a alpha-toxin in the culture medium dramatically inhibited s. aureus' ability to adhere to and internalize into epithelial cells. importantly,  we demonstrated that both the staphylococcal alpha-toxin and h35a mutated alpha-toxin are capable of retarding the adhesion and invasion of epithelial cells by streptococcus pyogenes. these findings suggest that the h35a toxoid has  the potential to be utilized as an inhibitor of s. aureus and s. pyogenes ability to adhere to and invade epithelial cells.

TI  == novel topoisomerase inhibitors: microbiological characterisation and in vivo efficacy of pyrimidines.
AB  == pyrimidine compounds were identified as inhibitors of dna topoisomerase iv through high-throughput screening. this study was designed to exemplify the in vitro activity of the pyrimidines against gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms, to reveal the mode of action of these compounds and to demonstrate their in vivo efficacy. frequencies of resistance to pyrimidines among staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae were <10(-10) at four times their minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics). these compounds exhibited a dual mode of action through inhibition of the pare subunit of dna topoisomerase iv as well as the gyrb subunit of dna gyrase, a homologue of dna topoisomerase iv. pyrimidines were shown to have mic(90) values (mic that inhibited 90% of the  strains tested) of </=2 mg/l against gram-positive pathogens, including meticillin-resistant s. aureus, quinolone- and meticillin-resistant s. aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, penicillin-non-susceptible s. pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes, and mic(90) values of 2- to >16 mg/l and </=0.5 mg/l against the gram-negative pathogens haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, respectively. the pyrimidines were bactericidal and exhibited a ca.  1000-fold reduction of the bacterial counts at 300 mg/kg in a s. pneumoniae lung  infection model. the microbiological properties and in vivo efficacy of pyrimidines underscore their potential as candidates for the treatment of soft-tissue infections and hospital-acquired pneumonia.

TI  == in silico modeling of the type 2 idi enzymes of bacillus licheniformis, pseudomonas stutzeri, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus for virtual screening of potential inhibitors of this therapeutic target.
AB  == isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase is an essential enzyme in those living organisms such as pathogenic strains of streptococcus and staphylococcus genera which rely on the mevalonate pathway for the production of isoprenoids. the pathogens contain type 2 idi in contrast to human that contains type 1 idi. therefore, the type 2 idi may be a potential target for the therapy of some infectious diseases. in the current study, a virtual screening by docking was performed among 2000 chemicals from cococo library to find a specific inhibitor for type 2 idis. to this end, the structures of the type 2 idis of bacillus licheniformis, pseudomonas stutzeri, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus were molded using comparative modeling and hidden markov model (hmm) based prediction. the predicted models were evaluated based on q-mean and prosa score.  molegro virtual docker with moldock scoring function was used for measuring the binding affinity of the found inhibitor to the active site of the models. also the inhibition effect of the compound was virtually tested on the crystallography-solved structures of the sulfolobus shibatae and thermus thermophilus type 2 idis as well as the escherichia coli type 1 idi. finally, the inhibition effect of the found inhibitor was virtually tested on the human type 1 idi. interestingly, the results suggest that the inhibitor efficiently binds to and inhibits the bacterial idis especially the type 2 idis of pathogens while it  is not inhibiting the human idi.

AB  == purpose: to evaluate the microbiology of acute otitis media (aom) with otorrhea due to spontaneous tympanic membrane perforation (stmp) in children living in milan, italy. methods: we evaluated middle ear fluid (mef) specimens taken from children affected by aom associated with stmp and otorrhea between january 2001 and december 2011. the fluid was collected by means of direct swab sampling, sent for culture, and processed within 4 h. results: a total of 705 specimens were obtained from 458 children (233 boys; mean age +/- sd 28.3 +/- 19.9 months), and  were positive for bacteria in 487 cases (69.1 %). the most frequently cultured infectious agent in single-pathogen cultures was haemophilus. influenzae (51.0 %), followed by streptococcus pneumoniae (19.4 %), streptococcus pyogenes (17.4 %), and staphylococcus aureus (10.7 %). after adjusting for the sub-period of data collection, age, gender, and previous full heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pcv-7) schedule, it was found that the prevalence of h. influenzae slightly increased in 2008-2010, and the prevalence of s. pneumoniae significantly decreased over time (p = 0.02). conclusions: aom with stmp is a particular form of aom in which s. pyogenes plays a significant causative role although, as in uncomplicated cases, h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae retain their etiological importance. the frequency of the detection of s. aureus in mef deserves further study because this pathogen can give rise to severe clinical problems. finally, although the use of pcv-7 was relatively efficacious, the benefit of pneumococcal vaccination would be increased by vaccines including a larger number of serotypes.

AB  == postmarketing surveillance of levofloxacin (lvfx) has been conducted continuously since 1992. the present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in japan to 30 selected antibacterial  agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (fqs). the common respiratory pathogens streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to fqs. in contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among s pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. regarding h. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to fqs, however, prevalence of lvfx-resistant escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of lvfx-resistant e. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence  of lvfx 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. another enterobacteriaceae member, klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to fqs, in contrast with e.  coli. in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), the percentage of fq-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other fqs. however, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) isolates were highly susceptible to fqs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. the prevalence of fqs-resistant  isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of fq-resistance in mrsa. the prevalence of fqs-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (utis) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in p. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (rtis). while this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were  noted in the prevalence of fq-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates derived from utis. the prevalence of multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from utis and 0.3% among isolates from rtis, a decrease from the results  of 2007. acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to fqs. imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a  prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance  of 81.3-82.5%, to fqs. ceftriaxone (ctrx) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to ctrx in some clinical isolates. the result of the present survey indicated that although  methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococcus faecium, p. aeruginosa from utis, n. gonorrhoeae, and e. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the fqs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. while fq resistance has been prevailing in e. coli, e. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to fqs. the other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against fqs.

TI  == [two bacteria and common skin infections].
AB  == common bacterial skin infections represent frequent disorders encountered in general practice and in dermatology as well. they encompass a series of infections affecting the epidermis, dermis, hypodermis and subcutaneous tissues.  the two main bacteria involved in these processes are streptococcus pyogenes and  staphylococcus aureus. the resulting infections show various clinical presentations. their management must be adapted to their gravity and to the putative or proven nature of the causal microorganism. searching for any skin ingress possibility and any favouring factor is always of importance in order to  stimulate healing and avoid recurrences. of note, skin possibly allows the ingress way for a secondary septicemic dissemination. conversely, skin is possibly involved in tissue localisation of septicemia.

TI  == novel carbapenem antibiotics for parenteral and oral applications: in vitro and in vivo activities of 2-aryl carbapenems and their pharmacokinetics in laboratory animals.
AB  == sm-295291 and sm-369926 are new parenteral 2-aryl carbapenems with strong activity against major causative pathogens of community-acquired infections such  as methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant strains), streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant strains), and neisseria gonorrhoeae (including ciprofloxacin-resistant strains), with mic(90)s of </= 1 mug/ml. unlike tebipenem (mic(50), 8 mug/ml), sm-295291 and sm-369926 had no activity against hospital pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic(50), >/=  128 mug/ml). the bactericidal activities of sm-295291 and sm-369926 against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren. the therapeutic efficacies of intravenous administrations of sm-295291 and sm-369926 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren, respectively, reflecting their in vitro activities. sm-295291 and sm-369926 showed intravenous  pharmacokinetics similar to those of meropenem in terms of half-life in monkeys (0.4 h) and were stable against human dehydropeptidase i. sm-368589 and sm-375769, which are medoxomil esters of sm-295291 and sm-369926, respectively, showed good oral bioavailability in rats, dogs, and monkeys (4.2 to 62.3%). thus, 2-aryl carbapenems are promising candidates that show an ideal broad spectrum for the treatment of community-acquired infections, including infections caused by penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae, have low selective pressure on antipseudomonal carbapenem-resistant nosocomial pathogens, and allow parenteral,  oral, and switch therapies.

TI  == spatial positioning of cell wall-anchored virulence factors in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == many virulence factors of gram-positive bacteria are anchored to the peptidoglycan by a sorting signal. while surface display mechanisms are well characterized, less is known about the spatial and temporal organization of these proteins in the bacterial envelope. this review summarizes recent studies on the  rod-shaped listeria monocytogenes, ovococcal streptococcus pyogenes and spherical staphylococcus aureus bacteria that provide insights into the compartmentalization of the surface and distribution of peptidoglycan-anchored proteins in space and time. we discuss models that support mechanistic bases for  localization of proteins at the poles, septum or lateral sites. the results indicate that deployment of virulence factors by pathogenic bacteria is a dynamic process tightly connected to secretion, cell morphogenesis, cell division rate and gene expression levels.

TI  == microbial diversity of bovine mastitic milk as described by pyrosequencing of metagenomic 16s rdna.
AB  == dairy cow mastitis is an important disease in the dairy industry. different microbial species have been identified as causative agents in mastitis, and are traditionally diagnosed by bacterial culture. the objective of this study was to  use metagenomic pyrosequencing of bacterial 16s rrna genes to investigate bacterial dna diversity in milk samples of mastitic and healthy dairy cows and compare the results with those obtained by classical bacterial culture. one hundred and thirty-six milk samples were collected from cows showing signs of mastitis and used for microbiological culture. additionally, 20 milk samples were collected from healthy quarters. bacterial dna was isolated from the same milk samples and the 16s rrna genes were individually amplified and pyrosequenced. discriminant analysis showed that the groups of samples that were most clearly different from the rest and thus easily discriminated were the normal milk samples from healthy cows and those characterised by culture as trueperella pyogenes and streptococcus spp. the mastitis pathogens identified by culture were generally among the most frequent organisms detected by pyrosequencing, and in some cases (escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. and streptococcus uberis mastitis)  the single most prevalent microorganism. trueperella pyogenes sequences were the  second most prevalent sequences in mastitis cases diagnosed as trueperella pyogenes by culture, streptococcus dysgalactiae sequences were the second most prevalent sequences in mastitis cases diagnosed as streptococcus dysgalactiae by  culture, and staphyloccocus aureus sequences were the third most prevalent in mastitis cases diagnosed as staphylococcus aureus by culture. in samples that were aerobic culture negative, pyrosequencing identified dna of bacteria that are known to cause mastitis, dna of bacteria that are known pathogens but have so far not been associated with mastitis, and dna of bacteria that are currently not known to be pathogens. a possible role of anaerobic pathogens in bovine mastitis  is also suggested.

TI  == bacterial skin colonization and infections in patients with atopic dermatitis.
AB  == atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects a large number of children and adults. the disease results from an interaction between genetic predisposition, host environment, skin barrier defects, and immunological factors. a major aggravating factor associated with atopic dermatitis is the presence of microorganisms on the patient's skin surface. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, for instance, can exacerbate chronic skin inflammation. as a result, antimicrobials have often been prescribed to control the acute phase of the disease. however, increased bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents has made it difficult for dermatologists to prescribe appropriate medication. in the presence of disseminated dermatitis with secondary infection, systemic antibiotics need to be prescribed; however, treatment should  be individualized, in an attempt to find the most effective antibiotic with fewer side effects. also, the medication should be used for as short as possible in order to minimize bacterial resistance.

AB  == ceftaroline, the bio-active form of parenterally administered ceftaroline fosamil, is a unique broad-spectrum cephalosporin with in vitro and in vivo activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and was approved for clinical use by the united states food and drug administration in october 2010. in over a year since ceftaroline fosamil approval, no widely used commercial susceptibility test system has added this new compound to its product, therefore  requiring use of alternative agar diffusion methods for clinical microbiology laboratories that want to test clinical isolates for ceftaroline susceptibility.  an alternative strategy of applying a surrogate beta-lactam class marker agent was assessed here, using results from 14,902 organisms (2008-2010) sampled in the usa. very high and acceptable accuracy (>/= 99.75%) was observed for predicting ceftaroline susceptibility as follows: 1) use of imipenem or meropenem minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) at </= 8 mug/ml (susceptible and intermediate categories) when testing s. aureus; 2) use of ceftriaxone mic at </= 2 mug/ml (susceptible and intermediate categories) when testing streptococcus pneumoniae as well as other streptococci (s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae); and 3) use of ceftriaxone, or cefepime, or ceftazidime at </= 2 mug/ml (susceptible category) when testing haemophilus influenzae. only when testing indicated enterobacteriaceae species using ceftriaxone susceptibility results did the ceftaroline-nonsusceptible errors increase (4.11%). these presented analyses offer a validated surrogate marker strategy for ceftaroline susceptibility testing, pending development and validation by the commonly used automated systems and agar diffusion commercial methods.

TI  == antioxidant and antibacterial activities of vegetables and fruits commonly consumed in thailand.
AB  == the vegetables and fruits commonly consumed in thailand have been suggested as rich sources of beneficial phytochemicals. in this study, vegetables and fruits native to the northeast region of thailand were evaluated for antioxidant and antibacterial activities. for vegetables, the extracts of limnophila aromatica (lamk.) merr. (extracted by 80% ethanol) and sauropus androgynus (linn.) merr. (extracted by distilled water) were found to have significant levels of antioxidant activities measured by dpph scavenging (ic5o at 4.92+/-0.01 and 4.71+/-0.01 mg ml-1, respectively) and frap antioxidant assays (74.38+/-0.25 and  74.00+/-0.04 mmol feso4 g-' of dry weight of vegetable, respectively) and also total phenolic compounds (10.96+/-0.02 and 10.34+/-0.01 mg gallic acid eq g-1 of  dry weight of vegetable). for fruits, the extracts derived from terminalia chebula retz. when using distilled water and 80% ethanol as solvents were shown to have significantly high levels of dpph scavenging (ic50 at 3.73+/-0.01 and 3.81+/-0.01 mg ml-1, respectively), frap antioxidant activities (80.85+/-0.10 and 65.93+/-0.11 mmol feso4 g-1of dry weight of fruit, respectively) and total phenolic compounds (13.10+/-0.06 and 10.66+/-0.02 mg gallic acid eq g-1 of dry weight of fruit, respectively). the antibacterial assays showed that moringa oleifera lam., limnophila aromatica (lamk.) merr., terminalia chebula retz. and phyllanthus emblica linn. that were extracted using 80% ethanol as solvent were found to have antibacterial activities against staphylococcus aureus, straphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes and propionibacterium acnes.  the results in this study may be useful for future application of edible plants that are native to thailand to be used as cosmetic or therapqutic products.

TI  == changing microbiology of pediatric neck abscesses in iowa 2000-2010.
AB  == objectives/hypothesis: to examine the changing microbiology of pediatric neck abscesses over a 10-year period with particular interest in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) infections and their associated antibacterial-resistance patterns, including resistance to clindamycin, a frequently used antibiotic for staphylococcus aureus. study design: retrospective chart review at a tertiary academic medical center. methods: one hundred and twenty-two consecutive pediatric patients managed between january 2000 and june 2010 with incision and drainage of a proven neck abscess. results: seventy-four patients with 76 abscesses were identified. a microorganism was found in 65 (85%) of the 76 abscesses. forty-three percent grew staphylococcus aureus (sa), 12% were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and 31% were methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa). there was a significant increase in the incidence of mrsa infections during the study period, with only one case of mrsa diagnosed in the first half of the study (from 2000-2004) compared with seven in the second half (from 2005-2010) (p = 0.023). the second most common bacterial etiology or isolate was streptococcus pyogenes in 27%, while the remaining 30% grew mixed oral flora and other microorganisms. conclusions: these findings demonstrate a statistically significant rise in the proportion of mrsa neck infections in pediatric patients in iowa. resistance to clindamycin was highest among mssa isolates. clindamycin-resistant s. aureus and  streptococcus pyogenes are established pathogens in neck infections. in communities with similar microbiology patterns, empiric treatment with combination therapy of a beta lactam and vancomycin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole should be initiated until culture results are available.

TI  == the effect of environmental conditions on expression of bacteroides fragilis and  bacteroides thetaiotaomicron c10 protease genes.
AB  == background: bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron are members of  the normal human intestinal microbiota. however, both organisms are capable of causing opportunistic infections, during which the environmental conditions to which the bacteria are exposed change dramatically. to further explore their potential for contributing to infection, we have characterized the expression in  b. thetaiotaomicron of four homologues of the gene encoding the c10 cysteine protease speb, a potent extracellular virulence factor produced by streptococcus  pyogenes. results: we identified a paralogous set of genes (btp genes) in the b.  thetaiotaomicron genome, that were related to c10 protease genes we recently identified in b. fragilis. similar to c10 proteases found in b. fragilis, three of the b. thetaiotaomicron homologues were transcriptionally coupled to genes encoding small proteins that are similar in structural architecture to staphostatins, protease inhibitors associated with staphopains in staphylococcus  aureus. the expression of genes for these c10 proteases in both b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron was found to be regulated by environmental stimuli, in particular by exposure to oxygen, which may be important for their contribution to the development of opportunistic infections. conclusions: genes encoding c10 proteases are increasingly identified in operons which also contain genes encoding proteins homologous to protease inhibitors. the bacteroides c10 protease gene expression levels are responsive to different environmental stimuli suggesting they may have distinct roles in the bacterial-host interaction.

TI  == bacterial superinfection in zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis.
AB  == background: zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (zcl) is a polymorphic disease. it is generally accepted that bacterial superinfection may play a role in the clinical appearance of the lesions and may delay or prevent the healing process.  however, the pattern of bacterial pathogens involved has rarely been investigated. material/methods: the aim of this study was to identify the bacterial species contaminating the suspected zcl and their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics. microscopic examination of stained smears and cultures were used to differentiate zcl from non-zcl lesions in a rural area north of isfahan, iran from july to december 2009. bacteria were isolated from the lesions and identified and antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard microbiological techniques. results: the results show that 602 (68%) of 855 patients were positive for zcl, of which 83.4% with volcano-shape, 8.8% psoriasiform, 6.6% popular form and 1.2% with other atypical forms of zcl. the bacteria were isolated from 66.8% of zcl (70% of volcano-shape, 60% of psoriasiform and 25% of popular form) and 64.7% of non-zcl lesions. the most common species were staphylococcus aureus (41.7%) and s. epidermidis (28%) followed by bacillus sp. streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., proteus sp., enterobacter sp. and pseudomonas aeroginosa. ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, cefazolin and clindamycin were the most effective antibiotics. conclusions: bacterial superinfection appears to be very common in zcl, but its prevalence is not different from that of non-zcl lesions and it has little effect on the clinical appearance of anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (acl). local  lesion care and management of bacterial superinfection must be considered in the  treatment of zcl.

TI  == comparative study of nasal bacterial carriage in pediatric patients from two different geographical regions.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial carriage in the anterior nares of two different patient cohorts, aged 5-15 years. by use of a sensitive enrichment broth, gram-positive and -negative bacteria were cultured from the two cohorts of each 100 patients at the referral clinic in eritrea and at a german university hospital. in the german cohort, 27% of the patients were positive either for gram-negative (n=5) or -positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus (n=8; mrsa (n=2)), staphylococcus epidermidis (n=12), corynebacterium spp. (n=4), and streptococcus pyogenes (n=1). in comparison, the  eritrean cohort revealed 33% bacterial carriers in the anterior nares. among the  identified species were s. aureus (n=2), s. epidermidis (n=13), streptococcus haemolyticus (n=9), and gram-negative rods including klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca (n=5), enterobacter agglomerans (n=4), escherichia coli (n=2), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1). noteworthy, none of the eritrean patients were  positive for mrsa. in both cohorts there was no co-occurrence of gram-positive and -negative bacteria in the anterior nares. however, we observed in two subjects of the eritrean cohort co-colonization with s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus. the occurrence of gram-negative bacteria was less significant by age in the german cohort, whereas in the eritrean cohort gram-negative bacteria were more frequently detected in carriers aged 5-9 years. continued surveillance  of s. aureus and gram-negative bacteria carriage deserves further attention and might help to determine future trends in the characteristics of nasal carriage, subsequent incidence of infections, and the potential effectiveness of targeted population based intervention.

TI  == evolutionary paths of streptococcal and staphylococcal superantigens.
AB  == background: streptococcus pyogenes (gas) harbors several superantigens (sags) in  the prophage region of its genome, although speg and smez are not located in this region. the diversity of sags is thought to arise during horizontal transfer, but their evolutionary pathways have not yet been determined. we recently completed sequencing the entire genome of s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (sdse), the closest relative of gas. although speg is the only sag gene of sdse, speg was present in only 50% of clinical sdse strains and smez in none. in this study, we  analyzed the evolutionary paths of streptococcal and staphylococcal sags. results: we compared the sequences of the 12-60 kb speg regions of nine sdse strains, five speg(+) and four speg(-). we found that the synteny of this region  was highly conserved, whether or not the speg gene was present. synteny analyses  based on genome-wide comparisons of gas and sdse indicated that speg is the direct descendant of a common ancestor of streptococcal sags, whereas smez was deleted from sdse after sdse and gas split from a common ancestor. cumulative nucleotide skew analysis of sdse genomes suggested that speg was located outside  segments of steeper slopes than the stable region in the genome, whereas the region flanking smez was unstable, as expected from the results of gas. we also detected a previously undescribed staphylococcal sag gene, selw, and a staphylococcal sag -like gene, ssl, in the core genomes of all staphylococcus aureus strains sequenced. amino acid substitution analyses, based on dn/ds window analysis of the products encoded by speg, selw and ssl suggested that all three genes have been subjected to strong positive selection. evolutionary analysis based on the bayesian markov chain monte carlo method showed that each clade included at least one direct descendant. conclusions: our findings reveal a plausible model for the comprehensive evolutionary pathway of streptococcal and staphylococcal sags.

TI  == [necrotizing pneumonia - a rare complication].
AB  == necrotizing pneumonia is a rare complication of community-acquired pneumonia associated with destruction of the lung tissue during the infection and rise of necrotic foci in consolidated areas. staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, nocardia, klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus pneumoniae are the most common causative agents. risk factors for developing necrotizing pneumonia include smoking, alcoholism, old age, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung diseases or liver disease. diagnosis of necrotizing pneumonia requires supportive care, use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and monitoring for sepsis and respiratory failure.  hemoptysis, abscess, empyema and gangrene are possible complications and surgical intervention may be required. the authors present a clinical case of pneumococcal necrotizing pneumonia in a patient without important risk factors and favourable  progression with medical therapy. in this regard, a brief bibliographic review about this pathology is also made.

TI  == necrotizing fasciitis: is the bacterial spectrum changing?
AB  == purpose: necrotizing fasciitis (nf) is a rare, but potentially fatal pathology. the aim of the present study was to identify the population characteristics of the nf patients, the responsible bacteria, and the differences between survivors  and nonsurvivors. methods: in this retrospective case-control study, all patients with nf from january 1, 2005, to december 31, 2010, treated in an academic level  1 trauma center, were identified, and their medical records were reviewed. results: the mortality rate of the 24 identified patients was 20.8 %. the majority of the infections (54.2 %) (13/24) were monomicrobial. hemolytic streptococcus of group a (25 %) and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (20.8 %) were the commonest germs. the mean number of comorbidities was 3.62 (standard deviation (sd) 3.58). diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and immunosuppression were the commonest. mean number of operations was 8.1 (sd 4.7). five patients (20.8 %) developed a disseminated intravascular coagulation (dic);  all of them died. nonsurvivors, who presented with deteriorated coagulation factors, developed a dic (p < 0.001) and received more often antibiotic monotherapy (ampicillin/sulbactam) as initial empirical therapy (p < 0.001). conclusions: the present study suggests a shift of the bacterial spectrum towards monomicrobial infections with multiresistant bacteria. the early recognition of high-risk patients and the aggressive surgical treatment with at least double-schema antibiotic therapy are of outmost importance.

TI  == complement inhibitors from scabies mites promote streptococcal growth--a novel mechanism in infected epidermis?
AB  == background: scabies is highly prevalent in socially disadvantaged communities such as indigenous populations and in developing countries. generalized itching causes discomfort to the patient; however, serious complications can occur as a result of secondary bacterial pyoderma, commonly caused by streptococcus pyogenes (gas) or staphylococcus aureus. in the tropics, skin damage due to scabies mite infestations has been postulated to be an important link in the pathogenesis of disease associated with acute rheumatic fever and heart disease, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis and systemic sepsis. treatment of scabies decreases the prevalence of infections by bacteria. this study aims to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the link between scabies and gas infections.  methodology/principal findings: gas bacteria were pre-incubated with blood containing active complement, phagocytes and antibodies against the bacteria, and subsequently tested for viability by plate counts. initial experiments were done  with serum from an individual previously exposed to gas with naturally acquired anti-gas antibodies. the protocol was optimized for large-scale testing of low-opsonic whole blood from non-exposed human donors by supplementing with a standard dose of heat inactivated human sera previously exposed to gas. this allowed an extension of the dataset to two additional donors and four proteins tested at a range of concentrations. shown first is the effect of scabies mite complement inhibitors on human complement using elisa-based complement activation assays. six purified recombinant mite proteins tested at a concentration of 50 microg/ml blocked all three complement activation pathways. further we demonstrate in human whole blood assays that each of four scabies mite complement inhibitors tested increased gas survival rates by 2-15 fold. conclusions/significance: we propose that local complement inhibition plays an important role in the development of pyoderma in scabies infested skin. this molecular link between scabies and bacterial infections may provide new avenues to develop alternative treatment options against this neglected disease.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of 19 propolis extracts prepared in different solvents (ethanol and propylene glycol) (eep/pep), was evaluated against some bacterial and fungal isolates using the agar-well diffusion method. it was verified that all the samples tested showed antimicrobial activity, although results varied considerably between samples. results revealed that both types of propolis extracts showed highly sensitive antimicrobial action against gram-positive bacteria and fungi at a concentration of 20% (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, candida albicans and saccharomyces cerevisae) with a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 mg/ml, with a moderate effect against streptococcus pyogenes (mic from 17 to 26 mg/ml). to our  knowledge, this is the first study showing elevated antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria [salmonella enterica (mic from 0.6 to 1.4 mg/ml)]  and lesser activity against helicobacter pylori (mic from 6 to 14 mg/ml), while escherichia coli was resistant. this concluded that the basque propolis had a strong and dose-dependent activity against most of the microbial strains tested,  while database comparison revealed that phenolic substances were responsible for  this inhibition, regardless of their geographical origin and the solvent employed for extraction. statistical analysis showed no significant differences (p </= 0.05) between eep and pep extracts.

TI  == chemical composition of 8 eucalyptus species' essential oils and the evaluation of their antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities.
AB  == background: in 1957, tunisia introduced 117 species of eucalyptus; they have been used as fire wood, for the production of mine wood and to fight erosion. actually, eucalyptus essential oil is traditionally used to treat respiratory tract disorders such as pharyngitis, bronchitis, and sinusitis. a few investigations were reported on the biological activities of eucalyptus oils worldwide. in tunisia, our previous works conducted in 2010 and 2011 had been the first reports to study the antibacterial activities against reference strains. at that time it was not possible to evaluate their antimicrobial activities against  clinical bacterial strains and other pathogens such as virus and fungi. methods:  the essential oils of eight eucalyptus species harvested from the jbel abderrahman, korbous (north east tunisia) and souinet arboreta (north of tunisia) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities by disc diffusion and microbroth dilution methods against seven bacterial isolates: haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. in addition, the bactericidal, fungicidal and the antiviral activities of the tested oils were carried out. results: twenty five components were identified by gc/fid  and gc/ms. these components were used to correlate with the biological activities of the tested oils. the chemical principal component analysis identified three groups, each of them constituted a chemotype. according to the values of zone diameter and percentage of the inhibition (zdi, % i, respectively), four groups and subgroups of bacterial strains and three groups of fungal strains were characterized by their sensitivity levels to eucalyptus oils. the cytotoxic effect and the antiviral activity varied significantly within eucalyptus species  oils. conclusions: e. odorata showed the strongest activity against s. aureus, h. influenzae, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae and against all the tested  fungal strains. in addition, e. odorata oil showed the most cytotoxic effect. however, the best antiviral activity appeared with e. bicostata. virus pretreatment with e. bicostata essential oil showed better antiviral activity (ic(50) = 0.7 mg/ml, si = 22.8) than cell-pretreatment (ic(50) = 4.8 mg/ml, si =  3.33). the essential oil of e. astringens showed antiviral activity only when incubated with virus prior to cell infection. this activity was dose-dependent and the antiviral activity diminished with the decreasing essential oil concentration.

AB  == we assessed the bioactivity of g. kola seeds on streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, plesiomonas shigelloides and salmonella typhimurium. the crude ethyl acetate, ethanol, methanol, acetone and aqueous extracts were screened by the agar-well diffusion method and their activities were further determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) assays. the extracts were fractionated by thin layer chromatography (tlc). bioautography was used to assess the activity of the possible classes of compounds present in the more active extracts. column chromatography was used to purify the active compounds from the mixture, while gc-ms was used to identify the phytocomponents of the fractions. the inhibition zone diameters of the extracts ranged from 0-24 +/- 1.1 mm, while mic and mbc values ranged between 0.04-1.25 mg/ml and 0.081-2.5 mg/ml, respectively. the chloroform/ethyl acetate/formic acid (cef) solvent system separated more active compounds. the mic of the fractions ranged between 0.0006-2.5 mg/ml. cef 3 (f3),  cef 11 (f11) and cef 12 (f12) revealed the presence of high levels of linoleic acid, 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid and 2,3-dihydro-3,5-dihydroxy-6-methyl ester,  respectively. the results obtained from this study justify the use of this plant  in traditional medicine and provide leads which could be further exploited for the development of new and potent antimicrobials.

TI  == scabies: important clinical consequences explained by new molecular studies.
AB  == in 2004, we reviewed the status of disease caused by the scabies mite sarcoptes scabiei at the time and pointed out that very little basic research had ever been done. the reason for this was largely the lack of availability of mites for experimental purposes and, to a degree, a consequent lack of understanding of its importance, resulting in the trivial name 'itch mite'. scabies is responsible for major morbidity in disadvantaged communities and immunocompromised patients worldwide. in addition to the physical discomfort caused by the disease, scabies  infestations facilitate infection by bacterial pathogens such as streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus via skin lesions, resulting in severe downstream disease such as in a high prevalence of rheumatic fever/heart disease  in affected communities. we now have further evidence that in disadvantaged populations living in tropical climates, scabies rather than 'strep throat' is an important source of s. pyogenes causing rheumatic fever and eventually rheumatic  heart disease. in addition, our work has resulted in two fundamental research tools that facilitate much of the current biomedical research efforts on scabies, namely a public database containing ~45,000 scabies mite expressed sequence tags  and a porcine in vivo model. here we will discuss novel and unexpected proteins encountered in the database that appear crucial to mite survival with regard to digestion and evasion of host defence. the mode(s) of action of some of these have been at least partially revealed. further, newly discovered molecules that may well have a similar role, such as a family of inactivated cysteine proteases, are yet to be investigated. hence, there are now whole families of potential targets for chemical inhibitors of s. scabiei. these efforts put today's scabies  research in a unique position to design and test small molecules that may specifically interfere with mite-derived molecules, such as digestive proteases and mite complement inhibitors. the porcine scabies model will be available to trial in vivo treatment with potential inhibitors. new therapies for scabies may  be developed from these studies and may contribute to reduce the spread of scabies and the subsequent prevalence of bacterial skin infections and their devastating sequelae in the community.

TI  == [recurrent toxin-mediated perineal erythema in an 11-year-old child].
AB  == introduction: recurrent perineal erythema is a rare toxin-mediated disease. we report the case of recurrent toxin-mediated perineal erythema in a child. case report: an 11-year-old boy was hospitalized for erythematous pustular eruption involving the perineum and the axillary area. this erythema started a few days after the onset of pharyngotonsillitis and the patient's personal history involved another episode of pharyngotonsillitis which was followed by an identical cutaneous eruption. laboratory analysis confirmed the diagnosis of recurrent toxin-mediated perineal erythema. the skin disorder quickly improved and antistreptococcal antibiotic treatment was initiated to eradicate bacteria. discussion: recurrent toxin-mediated perineal erythema is a cutaneous disease mediated by superantigens which are toxins produced by staphylococci and streptococci. it is characterized by recurrent macular erythema involving the perineum. streptococcus pyogenes is the most common cause of recurrent toxin-mediated perineal erythema, with staphylococcus aureus being isolated most  rarely. this observation emphasizes the possibility of atypical clinical presentation with pustular lesions, and dermatologists must be mindful of this aetiology in order to isolate bacterial toxins and to initiate appropriate antibiotics.

TI  == lantibiotic production by pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesised, post-translationally modified antimicrobial peptides produced by gram positive bacteria, many which have broad-ranging antimicrobial activities. lantibiotics have long been the subject of investigation with a view to their application as food preservatives or chemotherapeutic agents for clinical and veterinary medicine, while the associated biosynthetic machinery has been employed for peptide engineering purposes. however, although many lantibiotics are produced by generally regarded  as safe or food-grade bacteria, it is increasingly apparent that a number of gram positive pathogens, including strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus uberis and enterococcus faecalis, also produce these compounds. it is proposed that production of these antimicrobials may provide the associated microorganisms with a competitive advantage when colonizing/infecting  a host, thereby enhancing the virulence of the producing strain. here we review the production of lantibiotics by these pathogens and discuss how their production may contribute to their disease-causing potential.

TI  == naturally occurring swine influenza a virus pb1-f2 phenotypes that contribute to  superinfection with gram-positive respiratory pathogens.
AB  == a combination of viral, bacterial, and host factors contributes to the severity and overall mortality associated with influenza virus-bacterium superinfections.  to date, the virulence associated with the recently identified influenza virus protein pb1-f2 has been largely defined using models of primary influenza virus infection, with only limited assessment in models of streptococcus pneumoniae superinfection. specifically, these studies have incorporated isogenic viruses that differ in the pb1-f2 expressed, but there is still knowledge to be gained from evaluation of natural variants derived from a nonhuman host species (swine). using this rationale, we developed the hypothesis that naturally occurring viruses expressing variants of genes, like the pb1-f2 gene, can be associated with the severity of secondary bacterial infections. to test this hypothesis, we  selected viruses expressing variants in pb1-f2 and evaluated outcomes from superinfection with three distinct gram-positive respiratory pathogens: streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pyogenes. our  results demonstrate that the amino acid residues 62l, 66s, 75r, 79r, and 82l, previously proposed as molecular signatures of pb1-f2 virulence for influenza viruses in the setting of bacterial superinfection, are broadly associated with enhanced pathogenicity in swine in a bacterium-specific manner. furthermore, truncated pb1-f2 proteins can preferentially increase mortality when associated with streptococcus pyogenes superinfection. these findings support efforts to increase influenza virus surveillance to consider viral genotypes that could be used to predict increased severity of superinfections with specific gram-positive respiratory pathogens.

TI  == linezolid effects on bacterial toxin production and host immune response: review  of the evidence.
AB  == background: linezolid is active against a broad range of gram-positive pathogens  and has the potential to also affect production of bacterial toxins and host immune function. objective: to assess the evidence for direct effects of linezolid on bacterial toxin synthesis and modulation of host immune responses. methods: literature searches were performed of the pubmed and ovid databases. reviews and non-english language articles were excluded. articles with information on the effect of linezolid on bacterial toxin synthesis and immune responses were selected for further review, and data were summarized. results: substantial in vitro evidence supports effects of linezolid on bacterial toxin production; however, the strength of the evidence and the nature of the effects are mixed. in the case of staphylococcus aureus, repeated observations support the inhibition of production of certain staphylococcal toxins (panton-valentine leukocidin, protein a, and alpha- and beta-hemolysin) by linezolid, whereas only  solitary reports indicate inhibition (toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, coagulase, autolysins, and enterotoxins a and b) or stimulation (phenol-soluble modulins) of toxin production by linezolid. in the case of streptococcus pyogenes, there are solitary reports of linezolid inhibition (protein m, deoxyribonuclease, and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins a, b, and f) or stimulation (immunogenic secreted protein 2 and streptococcal inhibitor of complement-mediated lysis) of toxin production, whereas published evidence for effects on streptolysin o production is conflicting. in vitro data are limited, but suggest that linezolid  might also have indirect effects on host cytokine expression through inhibition of bacterial production of toxins. in vivo data from preclinical animal studies and a single clinical study in humans are limited and equivocal insofar as a potential role for linezolid in modulating the host inflammatory response; this is due in part to the difficulty in isolating antimicrobial effects and toxin synthesis inhibitory effects of linezolid from any secondary effects on host inflammatory response. conclusions: available evidence supports the possibility that linezolid can inhibit, and in some cases stimulate, toxin production in clinically relevant pathogens. however, more research will be needed to determine the potential clinical relevance of those findings for linezolid.

TI  == [daptomycin in diabetic patients].
AB  == in diabetic patients, there is a high prevalence of skin or nasal carriage of staphylococcus aureus, which is associated with an increased risk of local or systemic infections and consequently with greater morbidity and mortality. the microorganisms causing most infections in diabetic ulcers and diabetic foot are s. aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, although chronic diabetic foot infections are generally polymicrobial, including pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacteria. the present article describes experience with daptomycin in the treatment of the  most frequent infectious complications in diabetic patients. the cubicin outcomes registry and experience (core) registry contains information on 60 patients with  skin and soft tissue infections treated with daptomycin, with a success rate of 83%. other recent studies comparing daptomycin with vancomycin or semi-synthetic  penicillins have also shown the efficacy and safety of daptomycin with cure rates of between 70% and 80%. in the european version of the core registry, the eurocore, diabetic patients who developed bacteremia or endocarditis due to gram-positive pathogens and who received daptomycin showed success rates of 76.8% and 72%, respectively. no significant differences were found in a study comparing daptomycin or standard therapy with vancomycin in methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) or antistaphylococcal penicillin in methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) in diabetic patients with bacteremia or endocarditis. because of its rapid bactericidal action and scarce adverse effects, daptomycin is an attractive antimicrobial agent in the treatment of gram-positive infections in diabetic patients, whether in monotherapy or in association with other agents.

TI  == minim typing--a rapid and low cost mlst based typing tool for klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == here we report a single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) based genotyping method for klebsiella pneumoniae utilising high-resolution melting (hrm) analysis of fragments within the multilocus sequence typing (mlst) loci. the approach is termed mini-mlst or minim typing and it has previously been applied to streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium. six snps  were derived from concatenated mlst sequences on the basis of maximisation of the simpsons index of diversity (d). dna fragments incorporating these snps and predicted to be suitable for hrm analysis were designed. using the assumption that hrm alleles are defined by g+c content, minim typing using six fragments was predicted to provide a d = 0.979 against known sts. the method was tested against 202 k. pneumoniae using a blinded approach in which the mlst analyses were performed after the hrm analyses. the hrm-based alleles were indeed in accordance with g+c content, and the minim typing identified known sts and flagged new sts.  the tonb mlst locus was determined to be very diverse, and the two minim fragments located herein contribute greatly to the resolving power. however these fragments are refractory to amplification in a minority of isolates. therefore, we assessed the performance of two additional formats: one using only the four fragments located outside the tonb gene (d = 0.929), and the other using hrm data from these four fragments in conjunction with sequencing of the tonb mlst fragment (d = 0.995). the hrm assays were developed on the rotorgene 6000, and the method was shown to also be robust on the lightcycler 480, allowing a 384-well high through-put format. the assay provides rapid, robust and low-cost typing with fully portable results that can directly be related to current mlst data. minim typing in combination with molecular screening for antibiotic resistance markers can be a powerful surveillance tool kit.

TI  == serious skin infections in children: a review of admissions to gisborne hospital  (2006-2007).
AB  == aim: serious skin infections are an important and increasing problem in new zealand children. the highest national rates are in the tairawhiti (gisborne) region on the east coast of new zealand's north island, where evidence of significant ethnic disparities exists. this study aimed to describe the characteristics of serious skin infections in children hospitalised in the tairawhiti region. methods: the hospital charts of all children aged 0-14 years admitted to gisborne hospital between 1 january 2006 and 31 december 2007 for a serious skin infection were retrospectively reviewed and data on a range of variables analysed. results: there were 163 cases of serious skin infections during the study period with 83% occurring in maori children. the most common types of infection were cellulitis (38%) and subcutaneous abscesses (36%), and the most frequent sites of infection were the head, face and neck (32%) and lower limbs (32%). a previous episode of skin infection was recorded in 34% of children, with previous hospitalisation in 12%. a skin injury preceded infection  in 37% of cases, more than reported in the auckland and wellington regions. of the 77% of children who saw a gp 60% required immediate hospital admission. compared with figures from the auckland region, there were longer delays to medical care with a mean duration of symptoms of 2.5 days prior to visiting a gp. the most frequently isolated organisms were staphylococcus aureus (48%) and streptococcus pyogenes (20%) with similar proportions and resistance patterns to  other new zealand settings. conclusions: the characteristics of serious skin infections in the tairawhiti region are largely similar to those reported in other new zealand regions. however, some differences in preceding skin injuries and delays in seeking medical care exist which may contribute to the high incidence of hospitalised infections in the region. these differences require further investigation.

TI  == current concepts in laboratory testing to guide antimicrobial therapy.
AB  == antimicrobial susceptibility testing (ast) is indicated for pathogens contributing to an infectious process that warrants antimicrobial therapy if susceptibility to antimicrobials cannot be predicted reliably based on knowledge  of their identity. such tests are most frequently used when the etiologic agents  are members of species capable of demonstrating resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics. some organisms have predictable susceptibility to antimicrobial agents (ie, streptococcus pyogenes to penicillin), and empirical therapy for these organisms is typically used. therefore, ast for such pathogens is seldom required or performed. in addition, ast is valuable in evaluating the activity of new and experimental compounds and investigating the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistant pathogens. several laboratory methods are available to characterize the in vitro susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial agents. when the nature of the infection is unclear and the culture yields mixed growth or usual microbiota (wherein the isolates usually bear little relationship to the actual infectious process), ast is usually unnecessary and results may, in fact,  be dangerously misleading. phenotypic methods for detection of specific antimicrobial resistance mechanisms are increasingly being used to complement ast (ie, inducible clindamycin resistance among several gram-positive bacteria) and to provide clinicians with preliminary direction for antibiotic selection pending results generated from standardized ast (ie, beta-lactamase tests). in addition,  molecular methods are being developed and incorporated by microbiology laboratories into resistance detection algorithms for rapid, sensitive assessment of carriage states of epidemiologically and clinically important pathogens, often directly from clinical specimens (ie, presence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in fecal specimens).

AB  == this study aimed to establish the vaginal introitus microbial flora in girls with and without symptoms of vulvovaginitis, and to present the distribution of isolated microorganisms by age groups in girls with vulvovaginitis. we enrolled 500 girls with vulvovaginitis symptoms, aged 2-12 years, referred by their pediatricians for microbiological examination of the vaginal introitus swabs, and 30 age-matched asymptomatic girls. similar microbial flora was isolated in both groups, but the symptomatic girls had significantly more common positive microbiological findings compared to controls (p < 0.001). in symptomatic girls,  the following pathogenic bacteria were isolated: streptococcus pyogenes (4.2%), haemophilus influenzae (0.4%), and staphylococcus aureus (5.8%). bacteria of fecal origin were found in vaginal introitus swabs in 33.8% of cases, most commonly proteus mirabilis (14.4%), enterococcus faecalis (12.2%), and escherichia coli (7.0%). the finding of fecal flora was more common compared to controls, reaching a statistical significance (p < 0.05), as well as in girls aged up to 6 years (p < 0.001). candida species were found in 2.4% of girls with  vulvovaginitis symptoms. conclusion: the microbial ecosystem in girls with clinical signs of vulvovaginitis is complex and variable, and the presence of a microorganism does not necessarily imply that it is the cause of infection. the diagnosis of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls requires a complex and comprehensive approach, and microbiological findings should be interpreted in the context of clinical findings.

TI  == protease-armed bacteria in the skin.
AB  == the skin constitutes a formidable barrier against commensal and pathogenic bacteria, which permanently and transiently colonise the skin, respectively. commensal and pathogenic species inhabiting skin both express proteases. whereas  proteases secreted by commensals contribute to homeostatic bacterial coexistence  on skin, proteases from pathogenic bacteria are used as virulence factors, helping them colonise skin with breached integrity of the epithelial layer. from  these initial sites of colonisation, pathogens can disseminate into deeper layers of skin, possibly leading to the spread of infection. secreted bacterial proteases probably play an important role in this process and in the deterrence of innate defence mechanisms. for example, staphylococcus aureus proteases are essential for changing the bacterial phenotype from adhesive to invasive by degrading adhesins on the bacterial cell surface. secreted staphylococcal proteases mediate pathogen penetration by degrading collagen and elastin, essential components of connective tissue in the dermis. the activation of the contact system and kinin generation by streptococcus pyogenes and s. aureus proteases contributes to an inflammatory reaction manifested by oedema, redness and pain. kinin-enhanced vascular leakage might help bacteria escape into the circulation thereby causing possible systemic dissemination of the infection. the inflammatory reaction can also be fueled by the activation of protease-activated  receptors on keratinocytes. concomitantly, bacterial proteases are involved in degrading antimicrobial peptides, disarming the complement system and neutrophils and preventing the infiltration of the infected sites with immune cells by inactivation of chemoattractants. together, this provides protection for colonising and/or invading pathogens from attack by antibacterial forces of the skin.

AB  == the reported case of hairy cell leukemia (hcl) refers to a 47-year-old man with pancytopenia, splenomegaly, a month and a half history of dyspnea on mild effort  and in common daily activities and a purplish-brown cutaneous node on the back of the left hand at the time of hospital admission. bone marrow aspiration showed an infiltration by a lymphoproliferative malignancy and the following cytochemical studies on bone marrow sample led to diagnosis of hcl. the biopsy of the skin lesion revealed a infiltrate of medium and large-size cells in the dermis with the the same cytologic features of leukemic blasts appearing in the bone marrow,  upon which the diagnosis of leukemia cutis was established. the differential diagnosis of leukemia includes other neoplastic hematopoietic disorders, such as  lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndromes, multiple myeloma, aplastic anemia, severe megaloblastic anemia, severe lymphocytosis, severe monocytosis, and bone marrow failure. in our case, the skin lesion was surgically removed and then left to heal by secondary intention due to the presence of bacterial infection by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. the wound was finally medicated to total healing with promogran(r), an advanced dressings which consists of a sterile, freeze-dried matrix composed of collagen and oxidised regenerated cellulose. the importance of our case lies in the fact that cases with association of hcl with leukemia cutis are very rare, and furthermore that after  the excision of the skin lesion of the left hand, the surgeons heal to let the wound close by secondary intention.

TI  == autopsy cases of fulminant bacterial infection in adults: clinical onset depends  on the virulence of bacteria and patient immune status.
AB  == to assist physicians in recognizing the potentially fatal onset of symptoms in cases of fulminant bacterial infection, we analyzed 11 autopsy cases of such infection (four caused by streptococcus pneumoniae, four by s. pyogenes, one by s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, one by staphylococcus aureus, and one by vibrio vulnificus). clinicohistopathologic features were evaluated. all patients  experienced sudden onset of hypotension and multiple organ failure, leading to unexpected death. blood culture confirmed bacteremia. the main chief complaints were gastrointestinal symptoms (45%) and limb pain (36%). all had an underlying chronic illness (82%), e.g., a hematologic disorder (36.3%) or liver cirrhosis (27.2%). necrotizing fasciitis occurred in only 55% of cases, with none involving pneumococcal infection. laboratory tests typically showed c-reactive protein elevation but without leukocytosis, indicating a high-level inflammatory state. in ten cases, death was attributed to circulatory collapse due to sepsis; severe  pulmonary congestion and hemorrhage were present in these cases. the onset of fulminant bacterial infection depends on both virulence of the bacterium and status of the host defense system.

TI  == toward new therapeutics for skin and soft tissue infections: propargyl-linked antifolates are potent inhibitors of mrsa and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == hospital- and community-acquired, complicated skin and soft tissue infections, often attributed to staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, present a significant health burden that is associated with increased health care costs and mortality. as these two species are difficult to discern on diagnosis and are associated with differential profiles of drug resistance, the development of an efficacious antibacterial agent that targets both organisms is a high priority. herein we describe a structure-based drug development effort that has produced highly potent inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase from both species. optimized  propargyl-linked antifolates containing a key pyridyl substituent display antibacterial activity against both methicillin-resistant s. aureus and s. pyogenes at mic values below 0.1 microg/ml and minimal cytotoxicity against mammalian cells. further evaluation against a panel of clinical isolates shows good efficacy against a range of important phenotypes such as hospital- and community-acquired strains as well as strains resistant to vancomycin.

TI  == identification of conserved antigens from staphylococcal and streptococcal pathogens.
AB  == the design of vaccines containing epitopes shared between different human pathogens may lead to cross-species protection. in order to identify potentially  conserved bacterial antigens, bacteriophage expression libraries of genomic dna from streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes were probed with human sera from staphylococcus aureus-infected and healthy individuals. by comparison with previous screening data from staphylococcus epidermidis and staph. aureus, putative antigenic, conserved domains across the genera were identified. in particular, three potentially antigenic conserved regions were identified based on the n-terminal domain of sacol0609 (sdrd), the c-terminal domain of sacol0723 (scab) and the c-terminus of sacol1140 (isda) from staph. aureus. the three domains were overexpressed, recombinant proteins were purified and polyclonal antisera raised against them recognized cell surface-located proteins from both staphylococcal and streptococcal species. the antisera were also able to opsonize both staph. aureus and strep. agalactiae thereby increasing their phagocytic uptake by human neutrophils. the conserved antigenic domains therefore represent potential cross-protective vaccine candidates.

TI  == discovery of lff571: an investigational agent for clostridium difficile infection.
AB  == clostridium difficile (c. difficile) is a gram positive, anaerobic bacterium that infects the lumen of the large intestine and produces toxins. this results in a range of syndromes from mild diarrhea to severe toxic megacolon and death. alarmingly, the prevalence and severity of c. difficile infection are increasing; thus, associated morbidity and mortality rates are rising. 4-aminothiazolyl analogues of the antibiotic natural product ge2270 a (1) were designed, synthesized, and optimized for the treatment of c. difficile infection. the medicinal chemistry effort focused on enhancing aqueous solubility relative to that of the natural product and previous development candidates (2, 3) and improving antibacterial activity. structure-activity relationships, cocrystallographic interactions, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy in animal models  of infection were characterized. these studies identified a series of dicarboxylic acid derivatives, which enhanced solubility/efficacy profile by several orders of magnitude compared to previously studied compounds and led to the selection of lff571 (4) as an investigational new drug for treating c. difficile infection.

TI  == an in vitro comparison of two silver-containing antimicrobial wound dressings .
AB  == preclinical studies have shown that release of silver by different wound dressings varies. the purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the antimicrobial activity of silver alginate (sa) and silver carboxymethylcellulose  (scm) dressings. an- timicrobial activity was tested using nine bacterial strains with log10 reduction and corrected zone of inhibition (czoi) as- says. antimicrobial effect was visualized using confocal microscopy (clsm). log10 reduction was comparable between both dressings for staphylococcus aureus ncimb 9518, candida albicans atcc 90028, finegoldia magna nctc 11804t, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa nctc 10662. log10 reduction was higher for scm than sa dressing-exposed escherichia coli (p = 0.035) and p. aeruginosa atcc 15692 (p = 0.032), and lower for scm than sa dressing-exposed streptococcus pyogenes (p = 0.007), peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus (p = 0.045), and s. aureus nctc 8325 (p =  0.012). both dressings were equivalent against four strains (5 to 8 days' activity) in the czoi assay. sa dressing silver activity lasted >24 hours longer  than scm activity when exposed to c. albicans (9 days' activity), e. coli (7 days' activity), f. magna (5 days' activity), and p. asaccharolyticus (5 days' activity), whereas the smc exhibited greater persistence against s. pyogenes (13  days' activity). clsm showed complete kill of s. aureus after 20 hours for both dressings. the results of this study confirm the broad-spectrum, in vitro activity of some dressings containing ionic silver. the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of both wound dressings was comparable, but clinical studies comparing the efficacy and effectiveness of silver-containing dressings to nonionic silver-containing dressings are needed.

TI  == different potency of bacterial antigens tlr2 and tlr4 ligands in stimulating mature mast cells to cysteinyl leukotriene synthesis.
AB  == the aim of study was to compare the potency of different bacterial antigens to induce rat mature mast cell to cysteinyl leukotriene (cyslt) generation. we examined toll-like receptor (tlr)2 agonists, i.e. lipoteichoic acid (lta) staphylococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus, lipoarabinomannan (lam) mycobacterium smegmatis, peptydoglican (pgn) staphylococcus aureus, as well as tlr4 agonists, i.e. lipopolysaccharide (lps) klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis, pophyromonas gingivalis and escherichia coli. we also estimated the effect of tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-, interleukin (il)-6-, ccl5-, and il-10-priming on mast cell cyslt synthesis following bacterial antigen activation. we found that all bacterial antigens activated mast cells to cyslt generation; however, the extent of cyslt release in response to stimulation varied. out of the examined antigens lps p. gingivalis exhibited the highest potency, as it induced cyslt generation acting at a very low concentration (10(-4) ng/ml). other lpss affected mast cells at higher (up to 10(5) -fold) concentrations. ltas were the most effective at concentrations of 5 x 10(2) ng/ml, while lam and pgn stimulated mast cells to maximal cyslt generation at concentrations as high as 10(5) ng/ml. anti-tlr2 and anti-tlr4 antibodies, as well as nuclear factor kappab (nf-kappab) inhibitor significantly diminished cyslt generation in response to bacterial antigen stimulation. priming with tnf,  il-6 and ccl5 did not affect bacterial antigen-induced cyslt generation, while il-10-pretreatment caused significant decrease in cyslt synthesis by mast cells.  these observations might have a great pathophysiological importance; inasmuch cyslts strongly influence the development and intensity of inflammation during bacterial infection.

TI  == bacterial skin and soft tissue infections: review of the epidemiology, microbiology, aetiopathogenesis and treatment: a collaboration between dermatologists and infectivologists.
AB  == bacterial skin and soft tissues infections (ssti) often determine acute disease and frequent emergency recovering, and they are one of the most common causes of  infection among groups of different ages. given the variable presentation of ssti, a thorough assessment of their incidence and prevalence is difficult. the presence of patient-related (local or systemic) or environmental risk factors, along with the emergence of multi-drug resistant pathogens, can promote ssti. these infections may present with a wide spectrum of clinical features and different severity, and can be classified according to various criteria. many bacterial species can cause ssti, but gram-positive bacteria are the most frequently isolated, with a predominance of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. the diagnosis of ssti requires an extended clinical history, a thorough physical examination and a high index of suspicion. early diagnosis is particularly important in complicated infections, which often require laboratory studies, diagnostic imaging and surgical exploration. ssti management should conform to the epidemiology, the aetiology, the severity and the depth of the infection. topical, oral or systemic antimicrobial therapy and drainage or debridement could be necessary, along with treatment of a significant underlying disease. this review discusses the epidemiology, the pathogenesis and  the classification of bacterial ssti, describes their associated risk factors and their clinical presentations. the authors provide a rational diagnostic and therapeutic approach to ssti in respect of antibiotic resistance and currently available antimicrobial agents.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of marine sponge clathria indica (dendy, 1889).
AB  == sponges are sessile filter feeders that have developed efficient defense mechanisms against foreign invaders such as viruses, bacteria or eukaryotic organisms. antimicrobial peptides are known as major components of the innate immune defense system in marine invertebrates. the aim of the present work was to study the antimicrobial properties of the indian sponge clathria indica with special reference to the identification of antimicrobial peptides. crude methanolic extract and its chloroform, n-butanol and aqueous fractions were tested against 16 human pathogens which include eleven bacteria with four of them being multidrug resistant and five pathogenic fungi. all fractions showed effective antibacterial activity against common and multidrug-resistant salmonella typhi and antifungal activity against c. albicans and c. neoformans. however, they were ineffective against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus. chloroform fraction being the most potent among the fractions tested on chemical investigation was indicative of the presence of peptides as evidenced by ninhydrin positive spots on tlc and presence of peptide bonds by nmr. its esi-ms showed presence of several peptides  in the range of m/z 850 to 980. structure of three peptides has been tentatively  assigned by esi-ms/ms or tandem mass analysis, on the basis of the amino acid sequence established. the results clearly show that the sponge c. indica represent an interesting source of marine invertebrates-derived antimicrobial peptides in the development of new strategies to treat various infectious diseases.

AB  == the bacterial superantigen exotoxins of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes are potent stimulators of polyclonal t-cell proliferation. they are the  causes of toxic shock syndrome but also induce cd25(+) foxp3(+) regulatory cells  in the cd4 compartment. several studies have recently described different forms of antigen-induced regulatory cd8(+) t cells in the context of inflammatory diseases and chronic viral infections. in this paper we show that bacterial superantigens are potent inducers of human regulatory cd8(+) t cells. we used four prototypic superantigens of s. aureus (toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 and staphylococcal enterotoxin a) and str. pyogenes (streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins a and k/l). at concentrations below 1 ng/ml each toxin triggers concentration-dependent t-cell receptor vbeta-specific expression of cd25 and foxp3 on cd8(+) t cells. this effect is independent of cd4(+) t-cell help but requires antigen-presenting cells for maximum effect. the cells also express the  activation/regulatory markers cytotoxic t-lymphocyte antigen-4 and glucocorticoid-induced tumour necrosis factor receptor-related protein and skin homing adhesins cd103 and cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen. superantigen-induced cd25(+) foxp3(+) cd8(+) t cells were as potent as freshly prepared naturally occurring cd4(+) regulatory t cells in suppressing proliferation of cd4(+) cd25(-) t cells in response to anti-cd3 stimulation. although superantigen-induced cd8(+) cd25(+) foxp3(+) express interleukin-10 and  interferon-gamma their suppressive function is cell contact dependent. our findings indicate that regulatory cd8(+) t cells may be a feature of acute bacterial infections contributing to immune evasion by the microbe and disease pathogenesis. the presence and magnitude of regulatory cd8(+) t-cell responses may represent a novel biomarker in such infections. superantigen-induced regulatory cd8(+) t cells also have therapeutic potential.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity and frequency of spontaneous gentamicin-resistant mutants in bacteria related skin infections].
AB  == gentamicin is used in an ointment form for the treatment of skin infections. to investigate the effect of gentamicin used as an ointment, the antimicrobial susceptibilities against staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococcus pyogenes, and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from community and medical settings were studied and compared with other antibacterial agents such as fradiomycin, chloramphenicol, and bacitracin used as active ingredient for each ointment. gentamicin showed antibacterial activities for all standard bacteria tested, but fradiomycin and chloramphenicol showed no such activities for st. pyogenes and p. aeruginosa, respectively. bacitracin showed activity for  st. pyogenes only. the strains of staphylococci isolated from healthy people were highly susceptible to gentamicin, while 49.3% of the isolates from the patients with skin infections were resistant to gentamicin and 96.4% of the gentamicin-resistant staphylococci carried the aminoglycoside-resistance gene aaca-aphd. the growths of all strains tested, except for two strains of p. aeruginosa, were inhibited by close below 128 microg/ml of gentamicin. furthermore, the frequencies of spontaneous mutants resistant to gentamicin, fradiomycin, and chloramphenicol were each investigated using s. aureus, s. epidermidis, st. pyogenes, and p. aeruginosa. at doses of more than 32 microg/ml  of gentamicin, no resistant mutants in any of bacteria strains tested were obtained. the concentration of gentamicin on the skin was calculated at approximately 895 microg/ml at least when the commercially used 0.1% gentamicin ointment was applied to the skin. therefore, our study strongly indicates that the gentamicin ointment used has a potency of sufficiently inhibiting the growth  of bacteria, including gentamicin-resistant strains, which cause skin infections  in the community.

TI  == visible light-responsive core-shell structured in(2)o(3)@cain(2)o(4) photocatalyst with superior bactericidal properties and biocompatibility.
AB  == antibacterial activity of photocatalytic substrates is primarily induced by ultraviolet light irradiation. visible light-responsive photocatalysts were recently discovered, offering greater opportunity to use photocatalysts as disinfectants in our living environment. the development of antibacterial photocatalysts, however, has mainly focused on titanium oxide (tio(2))-related materials with antibacterial properties not comparable with conventional chemical disinfectants. this study demonstrated that a core-shell structured in(2)o(3)@cain(2)o(4) substrate has superior visible light-induced bactericidal properties, as compared with several commercially available and laboratory-prepared visible light-responsive photocatalysts. the high performance is enhanced by more easily photoexcited electron transfer between the interfaces  of in(2)o(3) and cain(2)o(4) to minimize the electron-hole recombination during photocatalysis. additionally, when compared with tio(2)-based photocatalysts, in(2)o(3)@cain(2)o(4) treatments did not induce significant cell death and tissue damage, implying a superior biocompatibility. these findings suggest that in(2)o(3)@cain(2)o(4) may have potential application in the development of a safer and highly bactericidal photocatalyst. from the clinical editor: a photocatalytic susbstrate is described that functions in visible light, possesses bactericidal properties and better biocompatibility than the standard tio(2) based methods.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of a chitosan dextran-based hydrogel for surgical use.
AB  == a chitosan dextran-based (cd) hydrogel, developed for use in endoscopic sinus surgery, was tested for antimicrobial activity in vitro against a range of pathogenic microorganisms. the microdilution technique was used to determine minimum inhibitory, minimum bactericidal, and minimum fungicidal concentrations.  in addition, the time-kill efficacy of cd hydrogel was determined for two bacterial species. scanning and transmission electron microscopy were carried out to elucidate the antimicrobial mechanism of this compound. cd hydrogel was found  to be effective against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, and clostridium perfringens at its surgical concentration of 50,000 mg/liter. minimum bactericidal concentrations ranged from 2,000 to 50,000  mg/liter. dextran aldehyde (da) was found to be the antimicrobial component of the cd hydrogel with mbc ranging from 2,000 to 32,000 mg/liter. s. aureus appeared to be killed at a slightly faster rate than e. coli. candida albicans and pseudomonas aeruginosa were more resistant to cd hydrogel and da. scanning and transmission electron microscopy of e. coli and s. aureus incubated with cd hydrogel and da alone revealed morphological damage, disrupted cell walls, and loss of cytosolic contents, compatible with the proposed mode of action involving binding to cell wall proteins and disruption of peptide bonds. motility and chemotaxis tests showed e. coli to be inhibited when incubated with da. the antibacterial activity of cd hydrogel may make it a useful postsurgical aid at other body sites, especially where there is a risk of gram-positive infections.

TI  == rapid identification of bovine mastitis pathogens by high-resolution melt analysis of 16s rdna sequences.
AB  == accurate identification of mastitis pathogens is often compromised when using conventional culture-based methods. here, we report a novel, rapid assay tested for speciation of bacterial mastitis pathogens using high-resolution melt analysis (hrma) of 16s rdna sequences. real-time pcr amplification of 16s rrna gene fragment, spanning the variable region v5 and v6 was performed with a resulting amplicon of 290bp. first, a library was generated of melt curves of 9 common pathogens that are implicated in bovine mastitis. six of the isolates, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus  uberis, staphylococcus aureus and mycoplasma bovis, were type strains while the other 3, arcanobacterium pyogenes, corynebacterium bovis and streptococcus dysgalactiae, were bovine mastitis field isolates. four of the type strains, e. coli, s. agalactiae, k. pneumoniae and s. aureus, were found to be of human origin, while the other 3 type strains were isolated from bovine infections. secondly, the melt curves and corresponding amplicon sequences of a. pyogenes, e. coli, s. agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae, k. pneumoniae, s. uberis and s. aureus were compared with 10 bovine mastitis field isolates of each pathogen. based on the distinct differences in melt curves and sequences between human and bovine isolates of e. coli and k. pneumoniae, it was deemed necessary to select a set of bovine strains for these pathogens to be used as reference strains in the hrma. next, the hrma was validated by three interpreters analyzing the differential clustering pattern of melt curves of 60 bacterial cultures obtained from mastitis milk samples. the three test interpreters were blinded to the culture and sequencing results of the isolates. overall accuracy of the validation assay was  95% as there was difficulty in identifying the streptococci due to heterogeneity  observed in the pcr amplicons of s. uberis. the present study revealed that broad-range real-time pcr with hrma can be used as a powerful, fast and low-cost  tool for the differentiation of clinically important bacterial mastitis pathogens.

TI  == structural differences between the streptococcus agalactiae housekeeping and pilus-specific sortases: srta and srtc1.
AB  == the assembly of pili on the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria requires transpeptidase enzymes called sortases. in streptococcus agalactiae, the pi-1 pilus island of strain 2603v/r encodes two pilus-specific sortases (srtc1 and srtc2) and three pilins (gbs80, gbs52 and gbs104). although either pilus-specific sortase is sufficient for the polymerization of the major pilin, gbs80, incorporation of the minor pilins gbs52 and gbs104 into the pilus structure requires srtc1 and srtc2, respectively. the s. agalactiae housekeeping sortase, srta, whose gene is present at a different location and does not catalyze pilus polymerization, was shown to be involved in cell wall anchoring of pilus polymers. to understand the structural basis of sortases involved in such diverse functions, we determined the crystal structures of s. agalactiae srtc1 and srta.  both enzymes are made of an eight-stranded beta-barrel core with variations in their active site architecture. srta exhibits a catalytic triad arrangement similar to that in streptococcus pyogenes srta but different from that in staphylococcus aureus srta. in contrast, the srtc1 enzyme contains an n-terminal  helical domain and a 'lid' in its putative active site, which is similar to that  seen in streptococcus pneumoniae pilus-specific sortases, although with subtle differences in positioning and composition. to understand the effect of such differences on substrate recognition, we have also determined the crystal structure of a srtc1 mutant, in which the conserved dp(w/f/y) motif was replaced  with the sorting signal motif of gbs80, ipntg. by comparing the structures of wt  wild type srta and srtc1 and the 'lid' mutant of srtc1, we propose that structural elements within the active site and the lid may be important for defining the role of specific sortase in pili biogenesis.

TI  == nvc-422 topical gel for the treatment of impetigo.
AB  == impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial skin infection affecting children worldwide that is caused by the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, or both. staphylococcus species can quickly develop drug  resistance rendering mupirocin, fusidic acid, and erythromycin ineffective. preclinical and clinical studies demonstrated that nvc-422 (n, n-dichloro-2, 2-dimethyltaurine) rapidly kills pathogens without the development of drug resistance. 129 patients with clinically diagnosed impetigo were randomized to three dose groups (0.1, 0.5, or 1.5% nvc-422 topical gel) in a study conducted at 2 centers; 125 patients (97%) had microbiologically confirmed infection. treatment was administered three times a day (tid) for 7 days to all randomized subjects. response was measured at the completion of treatment (day 8) and 1 week post treatment (day 15) by the skin infection rating scale (sirs) and by microbiological response. a total of 120 subjects (96%) completed all 7 days of treatment and were assessed at end of treatment (eot). clinical response rate at  eot in the ppc population was excellent in each of the dose groups (84.6%, 87.2%, and 92.3% in the 0.1%, 0.5% and 1.5% dose groups respectively). the majority of the infections were caused by s. aureus, alone (106/125, 85%) of which approximately 10% were mrsa. there were no clinical recurrences in any treatment  groups. treatment-emergent adverse events were seen in 5.4% of the subjects (7/129) and were mild to moderate and resolved. nvc-422 topical gel administered  tid was well tolerated, with high rates of clinical and microbiological responses for treating impetigo.

TI  == bactericidal effect of ultraviolet c (uvc), direct and filtered through transparent plastic, on gram-positive cocci: an in vitro study.
AB  == the prevalence of wound infections caused by multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacteria is increasing along with concern about widespread use of antibiotics. in vitro studies have shown that ultraviolet radiation, especially uvc, is both an effective bactericidal and antifungal. however, evidence about its bactericidal effect on wounds covered with transparent dressings remains inconclusive. transparent dressings are used to retain moisture over the wound as part of an intermittent negative pressure dressing-the limited access dressing (lad) technique. because this dressing is designed to remain in place for a number of days, an in vitro study was conducted to explore the bactericidal effect of direct and indirect uvr through a transparent 0.15-mm thick transparent polythene sheet on gram-positive cocci. six bacterial strains were inoculated to sheep blood agar (sba) plates and exposed to direct and filtered uvc (254 nm) for 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 seconds with one media serving as a control (no uvc exposure). plates were subsequently incubated for 24 hours and bacterial growth observed. each set of experiment was repeated three times. direct uvc was shown to have good bactericidal effect (100% eradication of organisms inoculated) at durations ranging from a minimum of 5 seconds (methicillin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococcus and streptococcus pyogenes) to a maximum of 15  seconds (methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and enterococci species).  no bactericidal effect was observed when uvc was filtered through a 0.15-mm thick transparent polythene sheet. the results confirm the bactericidal effect of uvc in vitro and suggest that this effect can be achieved after a very short period of time. at the same time, film dressings appear to filter uvc. this may help protect skin from exposure to uvc but also limits its utility for use with the lad technique. in vivo studies to evaluate the shortest effective uvc treatment duration and follow-up clinical studies to ascertain treatment efficacy and effectiveness are needed.

TI  == [the characteristics of gram-positive bacteria isolated from skin lesions observed in ambulatory patients and the assessment of their susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs].
AB  == the bacterial skin and soft-tissue infections occur commonly and are characterized by more or less intensified changes within skin and subcutaneous tissue. the bacterial skin infections give rise to significant therapeutic problems associated with increasing resistance etiological agents of these infections to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics. the aim of this study was to assess the distribution of various gram-positive microorganisms in skin lesion observed in ambulatory patients in a period from june 2005 to december 2006. there were 116 bacterial strains isolated and identified from clinical samples: staphylococcus aureus, coagulase - negative staphylococi (s.epidermidis, s. xylosus, s.capitis, s.saccharolyticus), propionobacterium acnes, streptococcus spp. (s.agalactiae, s.pyogenes) i corynebacterium spp. (c. striatum, c. amycolatum, c. aquaticum). in the further part of this study we analyzed a profile of their susceptibility to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics in relation  to drugs recommended for the empirical therapy. the resultant resistance patterns among the examined bacterial isolates are indicative of certain divergence between recommended empirical antibiotic therapy and actual antimicrobial susceptibility of many etiologic factors of skin and soft-tissue infections.

TI  == the inhibition of infection by wound pathogens on scaffold in tissue-forming process using n-acetyl cysteine.
AB  == prevention of local infection from wound pathogens such as staphylococci and streptococci is crucial for tissue regeneration. n-acetyl cysteine (nac), an anti-oxidant amino acid derivative, has anti-microbial potential against various  species. this in vitro study evaluated whether nac prevented bacterial infection  of gingival fibroblasts and osteoblasts on a scaffold. n-acetyl cysteine delayed  growth of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes cultured in brain heart infusion (bhi) broth for 12 h in an almost dose-dependent manner (2.5, 5.0  or 10.0 mm). the number of rat gingival fibroblasts on collagen scaffolds with bacterial co-incubation was less than 30% of that in cultures without bacterial co-incubation at day 7. however, pre-addition of nac to the scaffold yielded a number comparable with that in culture without bacteria. fibroblasts on the scaffold with bacterial co-incubation were small, rounded and filled with bacteria and reactive oxygen species. pre-addition of nac, however, resulted in fibroblasts similar to those observed in culture without bacterial co-incubation. n-acetyl cysteine completely prevented devastating suppression of alkaline-phosphatase activity and extracellular matrix mineralization in osteoblastic culture on scaffolds with bacterial co-incubation. these results indicate that nac can functionalize a scaffold with anti-infective capabilities,  thus assisting healing of soft and hard tissues.

TI  == [the use of immunoglobulins in the treatment of infectious diseases].
AB  == the use of immunoglobulins in the treatment of infectious diseases has a long tradition. initially immunoglobulins from hyperimmunised animals were used for their antitoxic and antimicrobial activity. the development of preparations of human intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) and the observations of their long-term use enabled to assess their usefulness in the treatment of the diseases of proven or probable infectious etiology. in the treatment of infectious diseases ivig are currently used as immunomodulating drugs or immunosuppressive therapy, more frequently than the specific antibodies against the viruses, bacteria or their toxins. in practice of the infectious ward ivig are used as a drug of choice in the treatment of kawasaki disease, in toxic epidermolysis and stevens-johnson syndrome. as adjunctive therapy ivig are used in the infection with parvovirus b19, in hemophagocytic syndrome, for treatment of infections presenting with a severe toxemia caused by clostridium difficile, streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus. the rationale for the use of ivig may be also serious infections caused by enteroviruses, particularly neuroinfections. the use of ivig in the treatment of sepsis is controversial, since their effectiveness is not proven.

TI  == high-level fluorescence labeling of gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == fluorescence labeling of bacterial pathogens has a broad range of interesting applications including the observation of living bacteria within host cells. we constructed a novel vector based on the e. coli streptococcal shuttle plasmid pat28 that can propagate in numerous bacterial species from different genera. the plasmid harbors a promoterless copy of the green fluorescent variant gene egfp under the control of the camp-factor gene (cfb) promoter of streptococcus agalactiae and was designated pbsu101. upon transfer of the plasmid into streptococci, the bacteria show a distinct and easily detectable fluorescence using a standard fluorescence microscope and quantification by facs-analysis demonstrated values that were 10-50 times increased over the respective controls. to assess the suitability of the construct for high efficiency fluorescence labeling in different gram-positive pathogens, numerous species were transformed. we successfully labeled streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus aureus strains utilizing the egfp reporter plasmid pbsu101. in all of these species the presence of the cfb promoter construct resulted in high-level egfp expression that could be further increased by growing the streptococcal and enterococcal cultures under high oxygen conditions through continuous aeration.

TI  == population biology of gram-positive pathogens: high-risk clones for dissemination of antibiotic resistance.
AB  == infections caused by multiresistant gram-positive bacteria represent a major health burden in the community as well as in hospitalized patients. staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium are well-known pathogens of hospitalized patients, frequently linked with resistance  against multiple antibiotics, compromising effective therapy. streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes are important pathogens in the community and s. aureus has recently emerged as an important community-acquired pathogen. population genetic studies reveal that recombination prevails as a driving force  of genetic diversity in e. faecium, e. faecalis, s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes, and thus, these species are weakly clonal. although recombination has a relatively modest role driving the genetic variation of the core genome of s. aureus, the horizontal acquisition of resistance and virulence genes plays a key  role in the emergence of new clinically relevant clones in this species. in this  review, we discuss the population genetics of e. faecium, e. faecalis, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and s. aureus. knowledge of the population structure of these pathogens is not only highly relevant for (molecular) epidemiological research but also for identifying the genetic variation that underlies changes in clinical behaviour, to improve our understanding of the pathogenic behaviour of particular clones and to identify novel targets for vaccines or immunotherapy.

TI  == human leukocyte antigen class ii transgenic mouse model unmasks the significant extrahepatic pathology in toxic shock syndrome.
AB  == among the exotoxins produced by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, the superantigens (sags) are the most potent t-cell activators known to date. sags are implicated in several serious diseases including toxic shock syndrome (tss), kawasaki disease, and sepsis. however, the immunopathogenesis of tss and other diseases involving sags are still not completely understood. the commonly used conventional laboratory mouse strains do not respond robustly to sags in vivo. therefore, they must be artificially rendered susceptible to tss by using sensitizing agents such as d-galactosamine (d-galn), which skews the disease exclusively to the liver and, hence, is not representative of the disease in humans. sag-induced tss was characterized using transgenic mice expressing hla class ii molecules that are extremely susceptible to tss without d-galn. hla-dr3  transgenic mice recapitulated tss in humans with extensive multiple-organ inflammation affecting the lung, liver, kidneys, heart, and small intestines. heavy infiltration with t lymphocytes (both cd4(+) and cd8+), neutrophils, and macrophages was noted. in particular, the pathologic changes in the small intestines were extensive and accompanied by significantly altered absorptive functions of the enterocytes. in contrast to massive liver failure alone in the d-galn sensitization model of tss, findings of the present study suggest that gut dysfunction might be a key pathogenic event that leads to high morbidity and mortality in humans with tss.

TI  == foam sclerotherapy: investigating the need for sterile air.
AB  == background: sclerotherapy with foam is becoming increasingly popular for the treatment of varicose veins. there is no consensus on the necessity of sterile air or other gases to produce foam. objectives: to evaluate the potential risk of bacterial inoculation of polidocanol (pol) foam using room air and the antimicrobial properties of polidocanol. materials and methods: the amount of airborne microorganisms was quantitatively measured. four bacterial strains were  tested for susceptibility to polidocanol: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and streptococcus pyogenes. results: air measurements varied as a result of air movement and the number of people in the room. although the risk of introducing one colony-formin unit can be calculated as less than 1 in 330, the clinical relevance is still to be determined. no inhibition of bacterial growth was achieved with pol in of any of the tested strains. conclusions: foam sclerotherapy with pol prepared in a standard treatment room is a safe procedure without the risk of introducing a severe bacterial complication. the use of sterile air, nitrogen, or carbon dioxide is unnecessary and will make foam sclerotherapy with pol more elaborate and more expensive to use.

AB  == the rapidly evolving crisis of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms has contributed to the rise of patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial and community-acquired infections. therefore, innovative antimicrobial technology targeting mechanisms to which the bacteria are unlikely to evolve resistance is urgently needed. we have previously described a nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle (no-np) with efficacy against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and acinetobacter baumannii in vitro and in murine wound and abscess models. although the prior findings suggest that the no-np can be a useful therapeutic for skin and soft tissue infections, the antimicrobial spectrum of no-np has yet to be fully elucidated. in the current study, we investigated the efficacy of a no-np against several gram-positive and -negative  clinical isolates. we found that the no-np were uniformly active against all of the streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates examined, including strains that were both sensitive and resistant to commonly used antibiotics. we concluded that the no-np have the potential to serve as a novel broad spectrum antimicrobial agent.

AB  == perhaps the most crucial step in the clinical development of an antimicrobial agent is the selection of a dosing regimen. such decisions impact not only the success of a program but also the well being of individual patients, the emergence of resistance, and society as a whole. for fusidic acid, the selection  of a dosing regimen for the treatment of patients with acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infection (absssi) was based on the integration of knowledge gained from human population pharmacokinetic, in vitro infection, and mathematical models. the overarching goal of these studies was to identify a dosing regimen that would maximize the probabilities of positive clinical outcomes and limit the emergence of bacterial resistance during therapy. novel dosing regimens identified included 1500 mg twice daily on day 1 followed by 600  mg twice daily for 10-14 days, a regimen that was subsequently found to be effective in a phase 2 clinical study of patients with absssi. herein, we review  the data supporting the use of this novel fusidic acid dosing regimen, which will undergo further clinical evaluation in phase 3 clinical trials.

TI  == gram-positive bacterial superantigen outside-in signaling causes toxic shock syndrome.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococci) are gram-positive pathogens capable of producing a variety of bacterial exotoxins known as superantigens. superantigens interact with antigen-presenting cells (apcs) and t cells to induce t cell proliferation and massive cytokine production, which leads to fever, rash, capillary leak and subsequent hypotension, the major symptoms of toxic shock syndrome. both s. aureus and group a streptococci colonize mucosal surfaces, including the anterior nares and vagina for s. aureus, and the oropharynx and less commonly the vagina for group a streptococci. however, due to their abilities to secrete a variety of virulence factors, the organisms can also cause illnesses from the mucosa. this review provides an updated discussion of the biochemical and structural features of one  group of secreted virulence factors, the staphylococcal and group a streptococcal superantigens, and their abilities to cause toxic shock syndrome from a mucosal surface. the main focus of this review, however, is the abilities of superantigens to induce cytokines and chemokines from epithelial cells, which has been linked to a dodecapeptide region that is relatively conserved among all superantigens and is distinct from the binding sites required for interactions with apcs and t cells. this phenomenon, termed outside-in signaling, acts to recruit adaptive immune cells to the submucosa, where the superantigens can then  interact with those cells to initiate the final cytokine cascades that lead to toxic shock syndrome.

TI  == antibacterial activity of different honeys against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == to study the antimicrobial activity of honey, 60 samples of various botanical origin were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities against 16 clinical pathogens and their respective reference strains. the microbiological quality of  honeys and the antibiotic susceptibility of the various isolates were also examined. the bioassay applied for determining the antimicrobial effect employs the well-agar diffusion method and the estimation of minimum active dilution which produces a 1mm diameter inhibition zone. all honey samples, despite their origin (coniferous, citrus, thyme or polyfloral), showed antibacterial activity against the pathogenic and their respective reference strains at variable levels. coniferous and thyme honeys showed the highest activity with an average minimum dilution of 17.4 and 19.2% (w/v) followed by citrus and polyfloral honeys with 20.8 and 23.8% respectively. clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus and bacillus subtilis were proven to be up to 60% more  resistant than their equal reference strains thus emphasizing the variability in  the antibacterial effect of honey and the need for further research.

TI  == evaluation of the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics of fusidic acid against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes using in vitro infection models: implications for dose selection.
AB  == the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (pk-pd) of fusidic acid were investigated against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and streptococcus pyogenes using in vitro infection models. front-loaded and non-front-loaded fusidic acid dosing regimens were evaluated over 48 h using a 1-compartment infection model and over 240 h using a hollow fiber infection model (hfim). all dosing regimens demonstrated initial decreases in bacterial density against both  isolates in both in vitro models. a mechanism-based pk-pd model was developed to  describe the effect of the concentration-time course of fusidic acid on the time  course of mrsa in the in vitro infection model. with the use of this model and monte carlo simulation to evaluate the effect of different dosing regimens against mrsa, front-loaded [>/= 1200 mg every 12 h (q12) x 2 doses followed by >/= 600 mg q12 h] compared to non-front-loaded (600 mg q12 h) dosing regimens demonstrated better activity. hfim data confirmed the effect of the front-loaded  dosing regimens over 48 h and also demonstrated the suppression of growth of the  total population and resistant subpopulations for mrsa over 96 and 120 h, respectively, associated with these dosing regimens.

TI  == comparative study of immune status to infectious agents in elderly patients with  multiple myeloma, waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance.
AB  == whereas patients with multiple myeloma (mm) have a well-documented susceptibility to infections, this has been less studied in other b-cell disorders, such as waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (wm) and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (mgus). we investigated the humoral immunity to 24 different pathogens in elderly patients with mm (n = 25), wm (n = 16), and mgus (n = 18) and in age-matched controls (n = 20). antibody titers against pneumococci, staphylococcal alpha-toxin, tetanus and diphtheria toxoids, and varicella, mumps, and rubella viruses were most depressed in mm patients, next to lowest in wm and  mgus patients, and highest in the controls. in contrast, levels of antibodies specific for staphylococcal teichoic acid, moraxella catarrhalis, candida, aspergillus, and measles virus were similarly decreased in mm and mgus patients.  comparable titers in all study groups were seen against haemophilus influenzae type b (hib), borrelia, toxoplasma, and members of the herpesvirus family. finally, a uniform lack of antibodies was noted against streptococcus pyogenes, salmonella, yersinia, brucella, francisella, and herpes simplex virus type 2. to  conclude, although mm patients displayed the most depressed humoral immunity, significantly decreased antibody levels were also evident in patients with wm and mgus, particularly against staphylococcus aureus, pneumococci, and varicella. conversely, immunity was retained for hib and certain herpesviruses in all study  groups.

TI  == ceftaroline fosamil: a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  == ceftaroline fosamil, the prodrug of the active metabolite, ceftaroline, is a new, broad-spectrum cephalosporin recently approved in the usa for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssis) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (cabp). ceftaroline has potent in vitro activity against gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as common gram-negative organisms. the high affinity of ceftaroline for penicillin-binding  proteins is responsible for the potent activity observed against clinically relevant pathogens. with respect to the treatment of cabp, the activity of ceftaroline against pathogens such as s. pneumoniae, s. aureus, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis demonstrates coverage across a broad range of pathogens typically encountered in clinical practice. ceftaroline is also very active against common pathogens seen in absssis such as s. aureus (methicillin-susceptible s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. aureus) and streptococcus pyogenes. ceftaroline exhibits a dose-proportional pharmacokinetic  profile, similar to other renally excreted cephalosporins, and has a well-tolerated safety profile consistent with the cephalosporin class. ceftaroline fosamil is compatible via y-site administration with many other commonly administered parenteral drugs.

TI  == identification of bacteria isolated from nasal polyps and their ability to produce superantigens and biofilms in lebanese patients.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus superantigens and bacterial biofilms have been implicated in the development of chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. we conducted a study of 32 lebanese patients-21 males and 11 females, aged 15 to 71 years (mean: 39)-to identify bacteria isolated from nasal polyps and to determine if these bacteria produced superantigens and biofilms. polyps were surgically removed, homogenized, and subjected to bacteriologic studies. the presence or absence of s aureus enterotoxin a, b, c, and d (superantigen) genes was determined in all isolates by polymerase chain reaction. biofilm production by coagulase-negative staphylococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa was assessed by tissue culture plate assay. a total of 34 bacterial species/groups were isolated from the nasal polyps. of these, only 3 (8.8%) were s aureus, and only 1 possessed an enterotoxin-coding gene (enterotoxin b). moreover, of the 21 coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates that were found, none possessed the investigated genes, and only 1 had a strong biofilm-formation property. our results could not confirm that s aureus enterotoxins (superantigens) or biofilm-producing bacteria play a role in the development of nasal polyps in the lebanese group studied.

TI  == [arthritis and osteitis at the hand].
AB  == septic arthritis and osteitis at the hand are associated with a high morbidity. trauma is the major cause for these infections. in the majority of cases the fingers are involved. causative microorganisms are predominantly staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. in addition, an increasing number of gram-negative bacteria have been found in hand infections. as differential diagnosis, tumours and non-septic arthritis must be considered. treatment includes surgical debridement, immobilisation and functional rehabilitation. crucial for the surgical strategy are the virulence of the pathogens, the resistance of the patient and the location of the infection. if functional recovery cannot be expected, salvage procedures like arthrodeses and resection arthroplasties are sometimes required. surgical treatment is sufficient in septic arthritis and osteomyelitis of the hand. however, to avoid permanent disability,  rapid diagnosis and therapy are essential. this review describes our treatment concepts in septic arthritis and osteomyelitis at the hand.

TI  == bacteriology and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of peritonsillar abscess.
AB  == introduction: peritonsillar abscess is a common complication of acute tonsillitis. its management consists of aspiration or surgical drainage followed  by appropriate antibiotics. appropriate antibiotic treatment depends on the common organisms associated with infection and their antibiotic sensitivity pattern in local scenario. methods: pus samples aspirated from diagnosed cases of peritonsillar abscess and submitted for culture and sensitivity in last two years were included in this study. identification of different microorganisms was made  on the basis of the microscopic findings, observation of their colony morphology  and standard biochemical reactions. susceptibility pattern to commonly used antibiotics were determined by clinical laboratory standards institute (clsi) guidelines. results: altogether 24 pus samples were included in the study. positive culture was obtained from 18 samples. among them one organism was isolated from 13 samples whereas from five samples multiple organisms were isolated. from six samples no organisms could be cultured. altogether streptococcus pyogenes was isolated from 12 samples and staphylococcus aureus from five samples. other isolated organisms included haemophlilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterococcus species. penicillin was effective for streptococcus pyogenes whereas staphylococcus aureus was resistant  to it. cloxacillin was found to be effective for staphylococcus aureus. ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were found to be effective for both organisms. conclusions: streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus were more commonly  associated with peritonsillar abscess. streptococcus pyogenes were sensitive to penicillin but all staphylococcus aureus were resistant to it. this fact should be considered in clinical practice for management of peritonsillar abscess.

AB  == the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. all  staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (mic(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/ml and 2 mug/ml, respectively). ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), </=  0.06 mug/ml), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic(90), </= 0.06 mug/ml), staphylococcus epidermidis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml), and enterococcus faecalis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml). over 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/ml. ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and k. pneumoniae. the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus  pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (mic(90), 16 mug/ml). the  broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.

TI  == multistep resistance development studies of ceftaroline in gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
AB  == ceftaroline, the active component of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, is a novel  broad-spectrum cephalosporin with bactericidal activity against gram-positive and -negative isolates. this study evaluated the potential for ceftaroline and comparator antibiotics to select for clones of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis with elevated mics.  s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes isolates in the present study were highly susceptible to ceftaroline (mic range, 0.004 to 0.25 mug/ml). no streptococcal strains yielded ceftaroline clones with increased mics (defined as an increase in mic of >4-fold) after 50 daily passages. ceftaroline mics for h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis were 0.06 to 2 mug/ml for four strains and 8 mug/ml for a beta-lactamase-positive, efflux-positive h. influenzae with a mutation in l22. one h. influenzae clone with an increased ceftaroline mic (quinolone-resistant, beta-lactamase-positive) was recovered after 20 days. the ceftaroline mic for this isolate increased 16-fold, from 0.06 to 1 mug/ml. mics for s. aureus ranged  from 0.25 to 1 mug/ml. no s. aureus isolates tested with ceftaroline had clones with increased mic (>4-fold) after 50 passages. two e. faecalis isolates tested had ceftaroline mics increased from 1 to 8 mug/ml after 38 days and from 4 to 32  mug/ml after 41 days, respectively. the parental ceftaroline mic for the one k. pneumoniae extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-negative isolate tested was 0.5 mug/ml and did not change after 50 daily passages.

TI  == interferon gamma-dependent intestinal pathology contributes to the lethality in bacterial superantigen-induced toxic shock syndrome.
AB  == toxic shock syndrome (tss) caused by the superantigen exotoxins of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes is characterized by robust t cell activation, profound elevation in systemic levels of multiple cytokines, including interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma), followed by multiple organ dysfunction and often death. as ifn-gamma possesses pro- as well as anti-inflammatory properties, we delineated its role in the pathogenesis of tss. antibody-mediated in vivo neutralization of ifn-gamma or targeted disruption of ifn-gamma gene conferred significant protection from lethal tss in hla-dr3 transgenic mice. following systemic high dose seb challenge, whereas the hla-dr3.ifn-gamma(+/+) mice became  sick and succumbed to tss, hla-dr3.ifn-gamma(-/-) mice appeared healthy and were  significantly protected from seb-induced lethality. seb-induced systemic cytokine storm was significantly blunted in hla-dr3.ifn-gamma(-/-) transgenic mice. serum  concentrations of several cytokines (il-4, il-10, il-12p40 and il-17) and chemokines (kc, rantes, eotaxin and mcp-1) were significantly lower in hla-dr3.ifn-gamma(-/-) transgenic mice. however, seb-induced t cell expansion in  the spleens was unaffected and expansion of seb-reactive tcr vbeta8(+) cd4(+) and cd8(+) t cells was even more pronounced in hla-dr3.ifn-gamma(-/-) transgenic mice when compared to hla-dr3.ifn-gamma(+/+) mice. a systematic histopathological examination of several vital organs revealed that both hla-dr3.ifn-gamma(+/+) and hla-dr3.ifn-gamma(-/-) transgenic mice displayed comparable severe inflammatory changes in lungs, and liver during tss. remarkably, whereas the small intestines  from hla-dr3.ifn-gamma(+/+) transgenic mice displayed significant pathological changes during tss, the architecture of small intestines in hla-dr3.ifn-gamma(-/-) transgenic mice was preserved. in concordance with these histopathological changes, the gut permeability to macromolecules was dramatically increased in hla-dr3.ifn-gamma(+/+) but not hla-dr3.ifn-gamma(-/-) mice during tss. overall, ifn-gamma seemed to play a lethal role in the immunopathogenesis of tss by inflicting fatal small bowel pathology. our study thus identifies the important role for ifn-gamma in tss.

TI  == life-threatening cellulitis after traditional samoan tattooing.
AB  == objective: traditional samoan tattooing is a significant and valued cultural practice. any tattooing carries a risk of complications, including the potential  for serious bacterial infection. we discuss the complex nature of the public health investigation into two cases of serious bacterial infection following traditional tattooing occurring in the same region in new zealand within a six-week period. approach: description of two cases of life-threatening cellulitis (one with necrotising fasciitis) related to traditional samoan tattooing and presentation of findings from the public health investigation. discussion of the complex legal and cultural issues that arose. conclusion: our paper illustrates the potential for serious bacterial infection by tattooing when performed in a non-sterile manner. there are gaps in the regulatory framework available in new zealand to address the public health risks of unsafe tattooing practices. implications: it is important to balance the fundamental right to perform the traditional cultural practice of tattooing with the need for meticulous infection control. reducing the risk of infection will require working in partnership with the community to develop acceptable standards and guidelines  and to improve the regulatory framework.

TI  == etiology of invasive bacterial infections in immunocompetent children in korea (1996-2005): a retrospective multicenter study.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to identify the major etiological agents responsible for invasive bacterial infections in immunocompetent korean children. we retrospectively surveyed invasive bacterial infections in immunocompetent children caused by eight major pediatric bacteria, namely streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella species that were diagnosed at 18 university hospitals from 1996 to 2005. a total of 768 cases were identified. s. agalactiae (48.1%) and s. aureus (37.2%) were the most common pathogens in infants younger than 3 months. s. agalactiae was a common cause of meningitis (73.0%), bacteremia without localization (34.0%), and arthritis (50%) in this age group. s. pneumoniae (45.3%) and h. influenzae (20.4%) were common in children aged 3 months to 5 yr.  s. pneumoniae was a common cause of meningitis (41.6%), bacteremia without localization (40.0%), and bacteremic pneumonia (74.1%) in this age group. s. aureus (50.6%), salmonella species (16.9%), and s. pneumoniae (16.3%) were common in older children. a significant decline in h. influenzae infections over the last 10 yr was noted. s. agalactiae, s. pneumoniae, and s. aureus are important pathogens responsible for invasive bacterial infections in korean children.

AB  == in this study, three swab transport systems were evaluated: m40 transystem, amies broth with a relatively new type of swab (both copan diagnostics, corona, ca, usa), and ssi transportmedium (statens serum institut, copenhagen denmark). the clsi m40-a standard procedures and 11 culture collection strains were used. the transport systems were tested at room temperature for holding times of 0, 24, and 48 h, and both mono- and polymicrobial samples were included. after 24 h of simulated transportation, all systems were able to maintain the viability of all  organisms tested. ssi transportmedium exhibited the lowest maintaining ability, whereas the two copan systems were the most growth-promoting system. in polymicrobial samples, this latter feature was a problem. at 48 h, no transport system could maintain the viability of all strains, and the recovery rates differed depending on organism and device. the species most difficult to recover  in all the three systems was neisseria gonorrhoeae. when selecting a swab transport system, consideration must be given to the sample type, the conditions  that prevail locally, and the performance in the clinical setting.

TI  == chitosan augments photodynamic inactivation of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (pdi) was shown to be a promising treatment modality for microbial infections. this study explores the effect of chitosan, a polycationic biopolymer, in increasing the pdi efficacy against gram-positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa),  as well as the gram-negative bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. chitosan at <0.1% was included in the antibacterial process either by  coincubation with hematoporphyrin (hp) and subjection to light exposure to induce the pdi effect or by addition after pdi and further incubation for 30 min. under  conditions in which hp-pdi killed the microbe on a 2- to 4-log scale, treatment with chitosan at concentrations of as low as 0.025% for a further 30 min completely eradicated the bacteria (which were originally at approximately 10(8)  cfu/ml). similar results were also found with toluidine blue o (tbo)-mediated pdi in planktonic and biofilm cells. however, without pdi treatment, chitosan alone did not exert significant antimicrobial activity with 30 min of incubation, suggesting that the potentiated effect of chitosan worked after the bacterial damage induced by pdi. further studies indicated that the potentiated pdi effect  of chitosan was related to the level of pdi damage and the deacetylation level of the chitosan. these results indicate that the combination of pdi and chitosan is  quite promising for eradicating microbial infections.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of community-associated methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus is caused by phenol-soluble modulin derivatives.
AB  == community-associated methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (ca-mrsa) are causing an ongoing pandemic of mostly skin and soft tissue infections. the success of ca-mrsa as pathogens is due to a combination of antibiotic resistance  with high virulence. in addition, it has been speculated that ca-mrsa strains such as the epidemic u.s. clone usa300 have increased capacity to colonize human  epithelia, owing to bacteriocin-based bacterial interference. we here analyzed the molecular basis of antimicrobial activity detected in s. aureus strains, including those of the usa300 lineage. in contrast to a previous hypothesis, we found that this activity is not due to expression of a lantibiotic-type bacteriocin, but proteolytically processed derivatives of the phenol-soluble modulin (psm) peptides psmalpha1 and psmalpha2. notably, processed psmalpha1 and  psmalpha2 exhibited considerable activity against streptococcus pyogenes, indicating a role of psms in the interference of s. aureus strains with the competing colonizing pathogen. furthermore, by offering a competitive advantage during colonization of the human body, the characteristically high production of  psms in usa300 and other ca-mrsa strains may thus contribute not only to virulence but also the exceptional capacity of those strains to sustainably spread in the population, which so far has remained poorly understood.

TI  == comparative genome-wide analysis of small rnas of major gram-positive pathogens:  from identification to application.
AB  == in the recent years, the number of drug- and multi-drug-resistant microbial strains has increased rapidly. therefore, the need to identify innovative approaches for development of novel anti-infectives and new therapeutic targets is of high priority in global health care. the detection of small rnas (srnas) in bacteria has attracted considerable attention as an emerging class of new gene expression regulators. several experimental technologies to predict srna have been established for the gram-negative model organism escherichia coli. in many respects, srna screens in this model system have set a blueprint for the global and functional identification of srnas for gram-positive microbes, but the functional role of srnas in colonization and pathogenicity for listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis and clostridium difficile is almost completely unknown. here, we report  the current knowledge about the srnas of these socioeconomically relevant gram-positive pathogens, overview the state-of-the-art high-throughput srna screening methods and summarize bioinformatics approaches for genome-wide srna identification and target prediction. finally, we discuss the use of modified peptide nucleic acids (pnas) as a novel tool to inactivate potential srna and their applications in rapid and specific detection of pathogenic bacteria.

AB  == introduction: bactericidal, virucidal, and fungicidal activity of ozone is generally known and has been exploited for years in industry and medicine. ozone  therapy became an inherent element of the treatment of infection in such fields as surgery, dermatology, cosmetics, and dentistry. ozone is a gas, so it penetrates very well even into such tissues and spaces that are not easily accessible. thanks to the property of deep penetration and long ozone presence in tissues after treatment, a long-lasting bactericidal effect is achieved. the action of oxygen radicals is, however, not neutral for the human organism, therefore the use of an appropriate procedure and therapy algorithms is essential. material and methods: we decided to confirm the effect of antibacterial activity of ozone applied by means of the ozonytron device (made by biozonix) on model strains of streptococcus salivarius, pneumonia, pyogenes, and  agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, using two application patterns developed by us. results: we found a statistically significant difference in the size of zones of inhibited bacterial growth on all  media depending on the time of action of ozone. in the present paper, the bactericidal activity of ozone in relation to bacterial strains that are most frequently isolated from the oral cavity was confirmed. what is more, two models  of application of the gas on the infected medium were compared. conclusion: research on the use of ozone in combatting bacteria typical for dental diseases has shown that the gas has an oxidizing effect on these bacteria and is bactericidal.

TI  == comparative evaluation of bactericidal potential of four root canal filling materials against microflora of infected non-vital primary teeth.
AB  == background and objectives: since complete debridement of the root canals of the primary teeth is not practically possible due to the highly variable root canal anatomy, success of the endodontic therapy depends partly on the use ofantibacterial irrigating agents and root canal filling materials. recent literature indicates that anaerobes comprise a majority of the bacteria in necrotic root canals ofprimary teeth. the study determined the antibacterial effectiveness of four root canal filling materials namely calcium hydroxide, zinc oxide eugenol, vitapex and metapex against microbial specimens obtained directly  from necrotic root canals of primary teeth. method: microbial specimens were collected using sterile paper points, from 15 primary maxillary and mandibular posterior teeth of randomly selected children in the age group of 4-10 years with infected non vital primary teeth, requiring pulpectomy procedure. the microbial specimens collected were subjected to microbiological analysis and the antimicrobial potential of root canal filling materials were tested using agar diffusion technique. results: were statistically analyzed using one-way anova. facultative/aerobic organisms were isolated in all the cases, anaerobic organisms were isolated in 80% of the cases, and candida albicans was isolated in 1 case. zoe showed superior inhibitory activity against most of the organisms isolated followed by vitapex, calcium hydroxide and metapex in descending order. conclusion: our data may be useful as a guide for relative antimicrobial effectiveness or non-effectiveness of the materials employed. in vivo studies are required to state the specific antimicrobial activity and merits and demerits of  any of the test filling material.

TI  == novel bacterial nad+-dependent dna ligase inhibitors with broad-spectrum activity and antibacterial efficacy in vivo.
AB  == dna ligases are indispensable enzymes playing a critical role in dna replication, recombination, and repair in all living organisms. bacterial nad+-dependent dna ligase (liga) was evaluated for its potential as a broad-spectrum antibacterial target. a novel class of substituted adenosine analogs was discovered by target-based high-throughput screening (hts), and these compounds were optimized  to render them more effective and selective inhibitors of liga. the adenosine analogs inhibited the liga activities of escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus, with inhibitory activities in the nanomolar range. they were selective for bacterial nad+-dependent dna ligases, showing no inhibitory activity against  atp-dependent human dna ligase 1 or bacteriophage t4 ligase. enzyme kinetic measurements demonstrated that the compounds bind competitively with nad+. x-ray  crystallography demonstrated that the adenosine analogs bind in the amp-binding pocket of the liga adenylation domain. antibacterial activity was observed against pathogenic gram-positive and atypical bacteria, such as s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and m. pneumoniae, as well as against gram-negative pathogens, such as h. influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. the mode of action was verified using recombinant strains with altered liga expression, an okazaki fragment accumulation assay, and the isolation of resistant strains with liga mutations. in vivo efficacy was demonstrated in a murine s. aureus thigh infection model and a murine s. pneumoniae lung infection  model. treatment with the adenosine analogs reduced the bacterial burden (expressed in cfu) in the corresponding infected organ tissue as much as 1,000-fold, thus validating liga as a target for antibacterial therapy.

AB  == novel clarithromycin derivatives with c-4'' elongated arylalkyl groups were designed, synthesized and evaluated to probe the effect of different lengths of their c-4'' side chains on the activity against resistant bacterial strains. these derivatives had excellent activity against erythromycin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes and some of them exhibited greatly improved activity against erythromycin-resistant strains. compounds 18 and 16, which had the c-4'' elongated arylalkyl groups with eight atoms from the 4''-oxygen atom to the terminal benzene ring, were the most  effective against s. pneumoniae expressing the erm gene and the erm and mef genes. in contrast, the most potent compounds 3, 5, 9, 17 and 18 against s. pneumoniae expressing the mef gene had c-4'' elongated arylalkyl groups with three to eight atoms between the 4''-oxygen atom and the terminal aromatic ring.

TI  == the problem of complicated skin and skin structure infections: the need for new agents.
AB  == complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssis) continue to pose a significant clinical challenge. the most frequent cause of these infections is staphylococcus aureus, although other organisms, including streptococcus pyogenes and, in certain circumstances, enterobacteriaceae, are also involved. the relentless increase in methicillin resistance among s. aureus isolated in hospitals throughout the world has made it important to provide coverage for these organisms when treating csssis in hospitals. more recently, however, there  has been a striking increase in methicillin resistance among staphylococci isolated from infections acquired in the community, particularly in the usa. as a result, previous recommendations for empirical therapy of these important infections are now outdated. the papers in this supplement detail the properties  of a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin that has activity against mrsa and is, thus, an outstanding candidate for empirical therapy of csssis. the papers included provide data on the in vitro activity, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the clinical efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil, which is a welcome addition to our therapeutic armamentarium against csssis.

TI  == diagnosis of intramammary infection in samples yielding negative results or minor pathogens in conventional bacterial culturing.
AB  == up to half of quarter milk samples submitted for mastitis diagnosis are culture-negative results or lead to identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci or corynebacterium bovis in conventional culturing, the so-called minor pathogens. the interpretation and usefulness of these results in terms of udder and animal health management is limited, even though the amount of resources spent is relatively high. this work aimed to test two methods of analysis of milk samples with the goal of increasing detection of intramammary pathogens. in the first study, 783 milk samples were processed in duplicate: before and after freezing at -20 degrees c for 24 h, using standard bacteriological techniques. there was a significant difference between the two methods with samples frozen for 24 h yielding significantly fewer gram-positive catalase-positive cocci, gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive bacilli and significantly more samples leading to no growth, than samples before freezing. the number of samples yielding gram-positive catalase-negative cocci was not significantly affected by freezing. in the second study, a real-time pcr-based test was performed on milk samples with an individual quarter somatic cell count  above 500,000 cells/ml that were either negative (n=51 samples) or that led to the isolation of minor pathogens in culturing: corynebacterium bovis (n=79 samples) or non-aureus staphylococci (nas, n=32). a mastitis pathogen, beyond the result obtained with standard bacteriology, was detected on 47% of the no-growth  samples, on 35% of the samples from which c. bovis had been isolated and on 25% of the samples from which nas had been isolated. the most commonly detected major pathogen was escherichia coli, followed by streptococcus uberis, arcanobacterium  pyogenes/peptoniphilus indolicus and streptococcus dysgalactiae. these results suggest that simply freezing milk samples for 24 h does not increase the detection of intramammary bacteria in milk samples and therefore should not be recommended. however, use of the real-time pcr-based test may be useful in diagnosing intramammary infections when milk samples with high somatic cell counts are culture-negative or when culturing results in the detection of minor pathogens.

TI  == efficacy and safety assessment of a novel ultraviolet c device for treating corneal bacterial infections.
AB  == background: a prototype solid-state ultraviolet-c (uvc) led device may be useful  in the treatment of corneal microbial infections, as uvc is commonly used for eradicating bacteria, fungi and viruses in other settings. this study assessed the efficacy of 265 nm uvc from this led, on four different bacterial strains, and investigated the consequences of corresponding exposures on human corneal epithelial cells in vitro. methods: agar plate lawns of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pyogenes were exposed  to a 4.5 mm diameter 265 nm uvc beam at a fixed intensity and distance, for 30, 5, 4, 2 and 1 seconds. growth inhibition was assessed with a biorad gel imager, and the diameter of lucent areas of bacterial inhibition recorded. human corneal  epithelial cells cultured on glass cover-slips were exposed to corresponding doses of uvc from the same device. live/dead staining was performed and the results quantified. results: there was 100% inhibition of growth for all bacteria tested, at all exposure times. a 30-second exposure of human corneal epithelium to uvc gave no statistically significant decrease (p = 0.877) in the ratio of live to dead cells when compared to control cultures. conclusion: the results confirmed that a 1 second exposure to germicidal uvc from this led source was sufficient to inhibit microbial proliferation in the four bacterial strains tested in vitro. the literature suggests uvc at this dose could potentially be beneficial in treating corneal surface infections, without causing significant adverse effects, supported by our findings in human corneal epithelium exposed to uvc.

TI  == molecular analysis improves pathogen identification and epidemiologic study of pediatric parapneumonic empyema.
AB  == background: parapneumonic empyema (ppe) is an increasingly common complication of bacterial pneumonia. epidemiologic study is complicated by the low frequency of positive cultures. we sought to describe the epidemiology of ppe in children using molecular analysis of pleural fluid. methods: we performed molecular testing for bacterial pathogens using archived pleural fluid from children hospitalized in 2009 with ppe. real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to detect streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant), streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, and mycoplasma pneumoniae as well as pcr-based serotyping of s. pneumoniae was performed. demographic, laboratory, and microbiologic data were abstracted. results: pleural fluid specimens from 63 children were available for pcr. by culture, a pathogen was isolated from blood and/or pleural fluid in 22 (35%) patients, with s. pneumoniae in 15 (24%), s. pyogenes in 3 (5%), and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in 4 (6%). by pcr, a pathogen was detected in 53 (84%), including s. pneumoniae in 45 (71%). compared with culture, pcr testing significantly increased detection of any pathogen (35% vs. 84%; p < 0.001) and of s. pneumoniae (24% vs. 71%; p < 0.001). serotype 7f was the most common pneumococcal serotype detected. comparison of culture-negative to culture-positive disease showed differences in both the pathogen profile and clinical outcomes. conclusions: molecular analysis of pleural fluid more than doubled the detection of pathogens causing ppe. s. pneumoniae was the most common cause of both culture-positive and culture-negative ppe, although serotype distribution and outcomes differed.

TI  == superantigen-induced proliferation of human cd4+cd25- t cells is followed by a switch to a functional regulatory phenotype.
AB  == bacterial superantigens are potent t cell activators. in humans they cause toxic  shock and scarlet fever, and they are implicated in kawasaki's disease, autoimmunity, atopy, and sepsis. their function remains unknown, but it may be to impair host immune responses increasing bacterial carriage and transmission. regulatory (cd25(+)foxp3(+)) t cells (tregs) play a role in controlling inflammatory responses to infection. approximately 2% of circulating t cells are  naturally occurring tregs (ntregs). conventional ag stimulation of naive foxp3(-) t cells induces ag-specific tregs. polyclonal t cell activation has been shown to produce non-ag-specific tregs. because superantigens are unique among microbial virulence factors in their ability to trigger polyclonal t cell activation, we wanted to determine whether superantigen stimulation of t cells could induce non-ag-specific tregs. we assessed the effect of superantigen stimulation of human t cells on activation, regulatory markers, and cytokine production by flow  cytometry and t cell suppression assays. stimulation of pbmcs with staphylococcal exotoxin a and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins a and k/l resulted in dose-dependent foxp3 expression. characterization of this response for streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin k/l confirmed its vbeta specificity, that cd25(+)foxp3(+) cells arose from cd25(-) t cells and required apcs. these cells had increased ctla-4 and cd127 expression, typical of the recently described activated converted treg-like cells, and exhibited functional suppressor activity comparable to ntregs. superantigen-stimulated cd25(+)foxp3(+) t cells expressed il-10 at lower superantigen concentrations than was required to trigger ifn-gamma production. this study provides a mechanism for bacterial evasion of the immune response through the superantigen induction of tregs.

TI  == identification and characterization of anti-microbial peptides from rabbit vaginal fluid.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides (amps) serve as a first line of host defense and represent an important, though poorly understood components of the innate immune system. the present study was an attempt to identify and characterize the major molecules having anti-bacterial activities from the vaginal fluid of rabbit, oryctologus cuniculus. amps from the rabbit vaginal fluid (rvf) were identified in the acid extracts of pooled rvf samples after rp-hplc purification. the protein, rvfamp was effective against gram negative (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram positive (staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes) bacteria. the results of acid urea-page-gel overlay assay (au-page-goa) demonstrated clear  zone of growth inhibition of e. coli corresponding to 6 and 15 kda protein bands. lc-ms data of these proteins indicated that 15 kda protein consists of lysozyme,  lipopolysaccharide binding protein (lbp), hemoglobin-alpha and beta subunits (hb-alpha/beta), whereas 9 kda protein band consists of transthyretin and calcyclin while uteroglobulin and neutrophil antibacterial peptide-5 (namp-5) are present in the 6 kda protein band. of the eight proteins, hb-alpha derived protein was further characterized, as it showed the highest probability based mowse score (pbms) of 288. a 25mer peptide, rvfhbalphap was active against several clinical pathogens as demonstrated by minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and radial diffusion assays (rda). the interaction of rvfhbalphap with bacterial liposome membrane was assessed by calcein dye leakage assay. rvfhbalphap did not show cytotoxicity against human endocervical cells (end1/e6e7) or erythrocytes. rt-pcr and immunofluorescence results revealed the expression of rvfhbalphap mrna and protein in rabbit vaginal tissue. to the best  our knowledge, this is the first report describing the detection of amps in rvfs. in conclusion, these studies indicated that vaginal epithelial cells (vec) derived rvfhbalphap may have therapeutic potential in the management of reproductive well being of rabbits. the major reason for undertaking this study in rabbits is that, it forms an excellent in vivo model system for human's studies.

TI  == [modification of antibiotic resistance in microbial symbiosis].
AB  == in antibiotic therapy it is necessary to use drugs active against the pathogen in its association with the host normal microflora. the aim of the study was to investigate modification of antibiotic resistance under conditions of the pathogen association with the representatives of the host normal microflora and to develop the microbiological criteria for determining effectiveness of antibacterials. modification of microbial antibiotic resistance was investigated  in 408 associations. various changes in the antibiotic resistance of the strains  were revealed: synergism, antagonism and indifference. on the basis of the results it was concluded that in the choice of the antibiotic active against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes the preference should be given to oxacillin, gentamicin and levomycetin, since the resistance of the pathogens to these antibiotics under the association conditions did not increase, which could contribute to their destruction, whereas the resistance of the normoflora increased or did not change, which was important for its retention in the biocenosis. the data on changeability of the antibiotic resistance of the microbial strains under the association conditions made it possible to develop microbiological criteria for determining effectiveness of antibiotics in the treatment of inflammatory diseases of microbial etiology (rf patent no. 2231554).

TI  == myeloperoxidase selectively binds and selectively kills microbes.
AB  == myeloperoxidase (mpo) is reported to selectively bind to bacteria. the present study provides direct evidence of mpo binding selectivity and tests the relationship of selective binding to selective killing. the microbicidal effectiveness of h(2)o(2) and of ocl(-) was compared to that of mpo plus h(2)o(2). synergistic microbicidal action was investigated by combining streptococcus sanguinis, a h(2)o(2)-producing microbe showing low mpo binding, with high-mpo-binding escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, or pseudomonas aeruginosa without exogenous h(2)o(2), with and without mpo, and with and without erythrocytes (red blood cells [rbcs]). selectivity of mpo microbicidal action was conventionally measured as the mpo mic and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) for 82 bacteria including e. coli, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and viridans streptococci. both h(2)o(2) and ocl(-) destroyed rbcs at submicrobicidal concentrations. nanomolar concentrations of mpo increased h(2)o(2) microbicidal action 1,000-fold. streptococci plus mpo produced potent synergistic microbicidal action against all microbes tested, and rbcs caused only a small decrease in potency without erythrocyte damage. mpo directly killed h(2)o(2)-producing s. pyogenes but was ineffective against non-h(2)o(2)-producing e. faecalis. the mpo  mics and mbcs for e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus were significantly lower  than those for e. faecalis. the streptococcal studies showed much higher mic/mbc  results, but such testing required lysed horse blood-supplemented medium, thus preventing valid comparison of these results to those for the other microbes. e.  faecalis mpo binding is reportedly weak compared to binding of e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus but strong compared to binding of streptococci. selective mpo binding results in selective killing.

TI  == synergism between maggot excretions and antibiotics.
AB  == maggots are successfully used to treat severe, infected wounds. this study investigated whether maggot excretions/secretions influence the antibacterial activity of different antibiotics. minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal  bactericidal concentrations (mbc) were determined of gentamicin and flucloxacillin for staphylococcus aureus, of penicillin for streptococcus pyogenes, of amoxicillin and vancomycin for enterococcus faecalis, of gentamicin  for enterobacter cloacae, and of gentamicin, tobramycin, and ciprofloxacin for pseudomonas aeruginosa by checkerboard titration. a range of concentrations of antibiotics in combination with excretions/secretions was examined to investigate the potential of maggot excretions/secretions to affect antibacterial activity. the results showed a dose-dependent increase of the antibacterial effect of gentamicin in the presence of excretions/secretions on s. aureus. minimal concentrations and mbc of gentamicin decreased, respectively, 64- and 32-fold. the mbc of flucloxacillin and excretions/secretions against s. aureus were also decreased. the other antibiotic and excretions/secretions combinations exerted an indifferent effect. excretions/secretions alone did not have any antibacterial effect. the synergism between gentamicin and maggot excretions/secretions could be of direct importance in clinical practice, because it could allow the use of lower doses of gentamicin and thus minimize the risk of gentamicin-related side effects.

TI  == retapamulin: an antibacterial with a novel mode of action in an age of emerging resistance to staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) is the leading cause of nosocomial infections and responsible for more than 11 million skin and soft tissue infections annually. impetigo is a common skin infection and the most common bacterial skin  infection in children aged two to five years. the emergence of s. aureus isolates resistant to commonly utilized antibacterials for skin infections (beta-lactams,  erythromycin, fluoroquinolones and mupirocin) makes successful treatment an ongoing challenge. to treat skin infections such as impetigo, antibacterials with a short dosing schedule and low propensity to develop resistance should be used.  in 2007, retapamulin was the first agent for human use approved in the pleuromutilin class of antibacterials in the united states (u.s.), and is the first topical antibacterial indicated to treat impetigo in over 20 years. in vitro, retapamulin is highly potent against s. aureus and has a lower propensity  to develop resistance than mupirocin. in clinical studies, the convenient five-day b.i.d. (twice-daily) dosing of retapamulin is highly effective against impetigo due to methicillin- susceptible s. aureus and streptococcus pyogenes and may play an important role in limiting the development of resistance against systemic agents.

AB  == staphylococcus aureus is a prominent human pathogen and a leading cause of community- and hospital-acquired bacterial infections worldwide. herein, we describe the identification and characterization of the s. aureus 67.6-kda hypothetical protein, named for the surface factor promoting resistance to oxidative killing (sok) in this study. sequence analysis showed that the sok gene is conserved in all sequenced s. aureus strains and homologous to the myosin cross-reactive antigen of streptococcus pyogenes. immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analysis showed that sok was copurified with membrane fractions and was exposed on the surface of s. aureus newman and rn4220. comparative analysis of wild-type s. aureus and an isogenic deletion strain indicated that sok contributes to both resistance to killing by human neutrophils and to oxidative stress. in addition, the s. aureus sok deletion strain showed dramatically reduced aortic valve vegetation and bacterial cell number in a rabbit endocarditis model. these results, plus the suspected role of the streptococcal homologue in certain diseases such as acute rheumatic fever, suggest that sok plays an important role in cardiovascular and other staphylococcal infections.

AB  == given that cell-penetrating peptides (cpp) are cationic and often amphipathic, similar to membrane-active antimicrobial peptides, it may be possible to use cpp  conjugation to improve the delivery of photosensitisers for antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (antimicrobial pdt). we investigated the possibility of using a tat peptide to deliver the photosensitiser, tetrakis(phenyl)porphyrin (tpp) and kill bacteria. the tat peptide is a positively-charged mammalian cell-penetrating peptide with potent antimicrobial activity but no haemolytic activity. fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that the bioconjugate can bind to and/or be incorporated into all bacterial species tested. all species were susceptible to the tat-porphyrin, with the bactericidal effect being dependent on both the concentration and the light dose. using the highest light dose, treatment with the tat-porphyrin achieved reductions of 6.6 log(10) and 6.37 log(10) in the viable counts of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, and reductions of 5.74 log(10) and 6.6 log(10) in the viable counts of pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. moreover, the tat moiety appears to  confer antimicrobial properties to the conjugate, particularly for the gram positive strains, based on the observation of dark toxicity using 1 mum of tat-porphyrin. finally, the conjugate induced membrane destabilization by synergistic action of the peptide and pdt, resulting in carboxyfluorescein leakage from bacterial membrane-mimicking liposomes. these findings demonstrate that the use of cpp to deliver a photosensitiser is an effective way of improving the uptake and the treatment efficacy of antimicrobial pdt.

TI  == a single, engineered protein therapeutic agent neutralizes exotoxins from both staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes secrete exotoxins that act as superantigens, proteins that cause hyperimmune reactions by binding the variable  domain of the t-cell receptor beta chain (vbeta), leading to stimulation of a large fraction of the t-cell repertoire. to develop potential neutralizing agents, we engineered vbeta mutants with high affinity for the superantigens staphylococcal enterotoxin b (seb), sec3, and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin a  (spea). unexpectedly, the high-affinity vbeta mutants generated against seb cross-reacted with spea to a greater extent than they did with sec3, despite greater sequence similarity between seb and sec3. likewise, the vbeta mutants generated against spea cross-reacted with seb to a greater extent than with sec3. the structural basis of the high affinity and cross-reactivity was examined by single-site mutational analyses. the cross-reactivity seems to involve only one or two toxin residues. soluble forms of the cross-reactive vbeta regions neutralized both seb and spea in vivo, suggesting structure-based strategies for  generating high-affinity neutralizing agents that can cross-react with multiple exotoxins.

TI  == the pathogenesis of infection and immune response.
AB  == an understanding of the pathogenesis of infection, and the complex and fascinating 'relationship', or interaction, between the infecting organism and the host are advantageous when caring for patients with infections/infectious diseases, particularly as many of the clinical features of infection are as a consequence of the defence mechanisms mounted by the immune system. this article  aims to provide a brief overview of the pathogenesis of infection, explaining how the two branches of the immune system, the innate/natural immune response, and the adaptive/acquired immune response, mount an attack against invading bacteria. reference is made to bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus, clostridium difficile, streptococcus pyogenes, neisseria meningitidis and mycobacterium tuberculosis, and their effect on the human host and the immune response, through the processes of attachment/entry, evasion of host defences, replication, and damage to the host.

TI  == intrinsic nitric oxide-stimulatory activity of lipoteichoic acids from different  gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == lipoteichoic acid (lta) is a structural component of the cell walls of gram-positive bacteria. similar to lipopolysaccharide (lps) which is expressed in gram-negative bacteria, lta exhibits immunostimulatory properties. frequently observed positive response of lta in the limulus amebocyte lysate (lal) assay has been interpreted as a sign of lps contamination, raising doubts about the intrinsic immune activities of lta. regarding many similarities in immunobiological and physicochemical properties of lta and lps, we hypothesized that similar to lps, the lal reactivity of lta might be due to its ability to bind to lal. our data confirm the positivity of bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes ltas in the lal test. the estimates of suspected lps content were 605, 10.3, 6.2 and 127 pg/mug lta, respectively. the effectiveness of ltas to induce the no production in rat peritoneal cells was remarkably higher than that of equivalent concentrations of  reference lps (escherichia coli). the lps-induced no was inhibited by polymyxin b (pmx), the ic(50) of pmx:lps concentration ratio (pg:pg) being 1050:1. many fold  higher concentrations of pmx were needed to partially suppress the no-augmenting  effects of ltas, applied at concentrations representing the equivalents of lps. transposed to the concentrations of ltas per se, the ic(50)s of the pmx:lta ratios (mug:mug) ranged from 0.3:1 (s. aureus) to 7.5:1 (b. subtilis). it is concluded that lta is not necessarily contaminated with lps. the results prove the intrinsic immunostimulatory properties of ltas of gram-positive bacteria. the positive response of lta in the lal assay results from its capacity to bind to lal. in addition, lta binds with high affinity to pmx.

TI  == the streptococcal binding site in the gelatin-binding domain of fibronectin is consistent with a non-linear arrangement of modules.
AB  == fibronectin-binding proteins (fnbps) of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes mediate invasion of human endothelial and epithelial cells in a process  likely to aid the persistence and/or dissemination of infection. in addition to binding sites for the n-terminal domain (ntd) of fibronectin (fn), a number of streptococcal fnbps also contain an upstream region (ur) that is closely associated with an ntd-binding region; ur binds to the adjacent gelatin-binding domain (gbd) of fn. previously, ur was shown to be required for efficient streptococcal invasion of epithelial cells. here we show, using a streptococcus zooepidemicus fnbp, that the ur-binding site in gbd resides largely in the (8)f1(9)f1 module pair. we also show that ur inhibits binding of a peptide from the alpha1 chain of type i collagen to (8)f1(9)f1 and that ur binding to (8)f1 is likely to occur through anti-parallel beta-zipper formation. thus, we propose that streptococcal proteins that contain adjacent ntd- and gbd-binding sites form a highly unusual extended tandem beta-zipper that spans the two domains and mediates high affinity binding to fn through a large intermolecular interface. the proximity of the ur- and ntd-binding sequences in streptococcal fnbps is consistent with a non-linear arrangement of modules in the tertiary structure of  the gbd of fn.

TI  == bactericidal effects of non-thermal argon plasma in vitro, in biofilms and in the animal model of infected wounds.
AB  == non-thermal (low-temperature) physical plasma is under intensive study as an alternative approach to control superficial wound and skin infections when the effectiveness of chemical agents is weak due to natural pathogen or biofilm resistance. the purpose of this study was to test the individual susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria to non-thermal argon plasma and to measure the effectiveness of plasma treatments against bacteria in biofilms and on wound surfaces. overall, gram-negative bacteria were more susceptible to plasma treatment than gram-positive bacteria. for the gram-negative bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cenocepacia and escherichia coli, there were no survivors among the initial 10(5) c.f.u. after a 5 min plasma treatment. the susceptibility of gram-positive bacteria was species- and strain-specific. streptococcus pyogenes was the most resistant with 17 % survival of the initial 10(5) c.f.u. after a 5 min plasma treatment. staphylococcus aureus had a strain-dependent resistance with 0 and 10 % survival from 10(5) c.f.u. of the sa  78 and atcc 6538 strains, respectively. staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecium had medium resistance. non-ionized argon gas was not bactericidal. biofilms partly protected bacteria, with the efficiency of protection dependent on biofilm thickness. bacteria in deeper biofilm layers survived better after the plasma treatment. a rat model of a superficial slash wound infected with p. aeruginosa and the plasma-sensitive staphylococcus aureus  strain sa 78 was used to assess the efficiency of argon plasma treatment. a 10 min treatment significantly reduced bacterial loads on the wound surface. a 5-day course of daily plasma treatments eliminated p. aeruginosa from the plasma-treated animals 2 days earlier than from the control ones. a statistically significant increase in the rate of wound closure was observed in plasma-treated  animals after the third day of the course. wound healing in plasma-treated animals slowed down after the course had been completed. overall, the results show considerable potential for non-thermal argon plasma in eliminating pathogenic bacteria from biofilms and wound surfaces.

TI  == biological activity of the essential oil of kadsura longipedunculata (schisandraceae) and its major components.
AB  == objectives: the aim was to determine the chemical composition of the essential oil of kadsura longipedunculata and the biological activity of the oil and its major components. methods: the essential oil from stem bark of kadsura longipedunculata was analysed by capillary gas chromatography (glc/fid) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (glc/ms). the ability of the oil to reduce diphenylpicrylhydrazine (dpph(*)) was used to evaluate the antioxidant activity.  inhibition of both lipoxygenase and prostaglandin e(2) was used to assess the anti-inflammatory activity. antimicrobial activity was studied in vitro against a range of bacteria and fungi using diffusion and microdilution methods. inhibition of trypanosome proliferation was assessed using resazurin as vital stain. the in-vitro cytotoxicity of the essential oil on six human cancer cell lines (hepg2, mia paca-2, hela, hl-60, mda-mb-231 and sw-480) was examined using the mtt assay. key findings: fifty compounds, representing 97.63% of total oil, were identified. delta-cadinene (21.79%), camphene (7.27%), borneol (6.05%), cubenol (5.12%) and delta-cadinol (5.11%) were found to be the major components of the oil. the oil exerted a good antimicrobial activity against all gram-positive bacteria tested,  including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis. streptococcus pyogenes and s. agalactiae were the most sensitive bacteria with a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of 60 microg/ml  oil. the essential oil showed a moderate fungicidal activity against yeasts, but  it did not show any activity against gram-negative bacteria. the essential oil showed a good trypanocidal activity in trypanosoma b. brucei with an ic50 value of 50.52 +/- 0.029 microg/ml. radical scavenging activity had an ic50 value of 3.06 +/- 0.79 mg/ml. 5-lipoxygenase inhibition (ic50 = 38.58 microg/ml) and prostaglandin e(2) production inhibition (28.82% at 25 microg/ml) accounted for anti-inflammatory activity of the oil. the oil exhibited some degree of cytotoxic activity against mia paca-2, hepg-2 and sw-480 cell lines with ic50 values of 133.53, 136.96 and 136.62 microg/ml, respectively. the oil increased caspase 3/7  activity (an indicator of apoptosis) 2.5-4 fold in mia paca-2 cells. camphene and borneol did not show antioxidant activity. however, both compounds exhibited some degree of antimicrobial, trypanocidal, anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activity.  conclusions: this investigation provided evidence for, and confirmed the efficacy of, k. longipedunculata, a traditionally used chinese medicinal plant for the treatment of inflammation and infection.

TI  == serious infectious complications related to extremity cast/splint placement in children.
AB  == background: extremity injuries necessitating splinting or casting are commonly seen in the emergency department (ed) setting. subsequently, it is not uncommon for patients to present to the ed with complaints related to an extremity cast or splint. objective: to present a literature-based approach to the identification and initial management of patients with possible infectious cast/splint complications in the ed setting. case reports: we present two cases of serious infectious complications arising from extremity cast/splint placement seen in a single pediatric ed: a case of toxic shock syndrome in an 8-year-old child, and a case of necrotizing fasciitis resulting in upper extremity amputation in a 3-year-old child. conclusions/summary: a wide spectrum of potential extremity cast/splint infectious complications may be seen, which include limb- or life-threatening infections such as toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis. simply considering these diagnoses, and removing the cast or splint to carefully inspect the affected extremity, are potential keys to early identification and optimal outcome of cast/splint complications. it is also prudent to maintain particular vigilance when treating a patient with a water-exposed cast, which may lead to moist padding, skin breakdown, and potential infection. in patients with suspected serious infections, aggressive fluid management and antibiotic therapy should be initiated and appropriate surgical consultation obtained without delay.

AB  == objective: to review recent studies on the use of antibiotics in acne vulgaris which provide insight into the development of antimicrobial resistance. data sources: sources for this article were identified by searching the english literature by medline for the period 1960 to march 2009. study selection: the following relevant terms were used: acne, acne vulgaris, acne and antibiotic therapy, acne and antimicrobial resistance, acne and resistance mechanisms, acne  and systemic infections, acne and antibiotic resistance and coagulase-negative staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), acne and antibiotic resistance and upper respiratory infection. data synthesis: both correct and incorrect use of antibiotics for acne vulgaris can promote antimicrobial resistance. the development of this resistance is promoted by several factors, including antibiotic monotherapy, long-term administration of antibiotics, indiscriminate use outside their strict indications, dosing below the recommended levels, and the administration of antibiotics without concurrent benzoyl peroxide and/or topical retinoids. conclusion: long-term use of antibiotics in the treatment of acne vulgaris can lead to antimicrobial resistance with serious and intractable problems not limited to propionibacterium acnes (p. acnes), the skin and acne vulgaris themselves, but also to other bacterial species, with systemic consequences. these findings suggest that antibiotics should be prescribed in combination with benzoyl peroxide and/or topical retinoids and be limited to a maximum of several months.

TI  == 99mtc-human beta-defensin-3
AB  == antimicrobial peptides are small, cationic, amphiphilic peptides of 12-50 amino acids with microbicidal activity against both bacteria and fungi (1). the mammalian defensins can be subdivided into three main classes according to their  structural differences: alpha-defensins, beta-defensins, and theta-defensins. mammalian alpha-defensins are predominantly found in neutrophils and in small intestinal epithelial cells, whereas mammalian beta-defensins have been isolated  from both leukocytes and epithelial cells. recently, two novel human beta-defensins (human beta-defensin-3 (hbd-3) and human beta-defensin-4 (hbd-4))  have been identified. similar to hbd-1 and hbd-2, hbd-3 has microbicidal activity toward the gram-negative bacteria (e.g., pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli) and yeasts. in addition, hbd-3 kills gram-positive bacteria such as streptococcus pyogenes or staphylococcus aureus, including multi-resistant s. aureus strains. in contrast to hbd-1 and hbd-2, significant expression of hbd-3 has been demonstrated in non-epithelial tissues such as leukocytes, heart, and skeletal muscle. hbd-4 is expressed in certain epithelial cells and in neutrophils. a variety of radiolabeled compounds, including 67ga-citrate, 99mtc-ciprofloxacin, 18f-fdg, and 111in- or 99mtc-labeled antibodies that interact with specific receptors on the infiltrating leukocytes, and peptides have been evaluated for the detection of infections (2, 3). however, because they accumulate in both infected and inflamed areas of the body, these radiopharmaceuticals are nonspecific and cannot distinguish between infection and inflammation. in an effort to identify and develop radioactive compounds that are specific for the detection of infections, various investigators have evaluated the use of antimicrobial peptides that are found naturally in most multicellular  organisms (4). such peptides bind specifically to microbes, presumably through cationic domains that interact with anionic regions of the microbial membrane, and have been shown to distinguish infected tissue from inflamed tissue (5). liberatore et al.

TI  == streptococcus pyogenes ser/thr kinase-regulated cell wall hydrolase is a cell division plane-recognizing and chain-forming virulence factor.
AB  == cell division and cell wall synthesis are closely linked complex phenomena and play a crucial role in the maintenance and regulation of bacterial virulence. eukaryotic-type ser/thr kinases reported in prokaryotes, including that in group  a streptococcus (gas) (streptococcus pyogenes ser/thr kinase (sp-stk)), regulate  cell division, growth, and virulence. the mechanism of this regulation is, however, unknown. in this study, we demonstrated that sp-stk-controlled cell division is mediated under the positive regulation of secretory protein that possesses a cysteine and histidine-dependent aminohydrolases/peptidases (chap) domain with functionally active cell wall hydrolase activity (henceforth named as cdha (chap-domain-containing and chain-forming cell wall hydrolase). deletion of  the cdha-encoding gene resulted in severe cell division and growth defects in gas mutants. the mutant expressing the truncated cdha (devoid of the chap domain), although displayed no such defects, it became attenuated for virulence in mice and highly susceptible to cell wall-acting antibiotics, as observed for the mutant lacking cdha. when cdha was overexpressed in the wild-type gas as well as  in heterologous strains, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus, we observed  a distinct increase in bacterial chain length. our data reveal that cdha is a multifunctional protein with a major function of the n-terminal region as a cell  division plane-recognizing domain and that of the c-terminal chap domain as a virulence-regulating domain. cdha is thus an important therapeutic target.

AB  == objectives: commercially produced sterile green bottle fly lucilia sericata maggots are successfully employed by practitioners worldwide to clean a multitude of chronic necrotic wounds and reduce wound bacterial burdens during maggot debridement therapy (mdt). secretions from the maggots exhibit antimicrobial activity along with other activities beneficial for wound healing. with the rise  of multidrug-resistant bacteria, new approaches to identifying the active compounds responsible for the antimicrobial activity within this treatment are imperative. therefore, the aim of this study was to use a novel approach to investigate the output of secreted proteins from the maggots under conditions mimicking clinical treatments. methods: cdna libraries constructed from microdissected salivary glands and whole maggots, respectively, were treated with transposon-assisted signal trapping (tast), a technique selecting for the identification of secreted proteins. several putative secreted components of insect immunity were identified, including a defensin named lucifensin, which was produced recombinantly as a trx-fusion protein in escherichia coli, purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography and reverse-phase hplc, and tested in vitro against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. results: lucifensin was active against staphylococcus carnosus, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic 2 mg/l), as well as staphylococcus aureus (mic 16 mg/l). the peptide did not show antimicrobial activity towards gram-negative bacteria. the mic of lucifensin for the methicillin-resistant s. aureus and glycopeptide-intermediate s. aureus isolates tested ranged from 8 to >128 mg/l. conclusions: the tast results did not reveal any highly secreted compounds with putative antimicrobial activity, implying an alternative antimicrobial activity of mdt. lucifensin showed antimicrobial activities comparable to other defensins and could have potential as a future drug candidate scaffold, for redesign for other applications besides the topical treatment of infected wounds.

AB  == background: psoas abscess is a rare clinical entity that occurs chiefly after intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal infection. we report two cases of psoas abscesses caused by group a beta-haemolytic streptococcal infection having a cutaneous portal of entry. case reports: the first patient, a 50-year-old man, was feverish and had ulcerative and necrotic cutaneous lesions evocative of ecthyma that were progressing for three months and were recently associated with  a painful mass in the left iliac fossa, leading to difficulties in walking. the second patient, a 35-year-old woman with a medical history of intravenous drug addiction, was admitted to intensive care for sepsis syndrome following group a beta-haemolytic streptococcal infection with a cutaneous portal of entry (swelling on left lower limb). she remained unaccountably subfebrile 10 days after the start of antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin. abdominal cat scans for each patient confirmed the diagnosis of left psoas abscess. for the first patient, the same group a beta-haemolytic streptococcus was isolated in drainage  fluid and at the cutaneous injury site. the outcome was favourable in both cases  following extensive intravenous antibiotic therapy (amoxicillin) combined with percutaneous drainage (in the first case). discussion: psoas abscess can occur after locoregional infection and the portals of entry are usually gastro-intestinal, musculoskeletal or genitourinary, with many organisms capable  of causing such secondary abscesses. psoas abscess can also be a primary clinical event. staphylococcus aureus is the most common causative organism. the presented cases comprised secondary psoas abscesses with a cutaneous portal of entry. since the complete set of three evocative symptoms (prolonged fever, pain and psoitis)  is frequently seen late, diagnosis must be made on the basis of prolonged infectious state or unaccountable feverish abdominal pain. diagnosis is based on  abdominal cat scan and treatment involves the use of appropriate antibiotics as well as percutaneous or surgical drainage of the abscess. the mortality rate in this patient population remains high with survival being dependent on prompt initiation of therapy.

TI  == activation of tlr2 by a small molecule produced by staphylococcus epidermidis increases antimicrobial defense against bacterial skin infections.
AB  == production of antimicrobial peptides by epithelia is an essential defense against infectious pathogens. in this study we evaluated whether the commensal microorganism staphylococcus epidermidis may enhance production of antimicrobial  peptides by keratinocytes and thus augment skin defense against infection. exposure of cultured undifferentiated human keratinocytes to a sterile nontoxic small molecule of <10 kda from s. epidermidis conditioned culture medium (secm),  but not similar preparations from other bacteria, enhanced human beta-defensin 2  (hbd2) and hbd3 mrna expression and increased the capacity of cell lysates to inhibit the growth of group a streptococcus (gas) and s. aureus. partial gene silencing of hbd3 inhibited this antimicrobial action. this effect was relevant in vivo as administration of secm to mice decreased susceptibility to infection by gas. toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) was important to this process as a tlr2-neutralizing antibody blocked induction of hbds 2 and 3, and tlr2-deficient  mice did not show induction of mbd4. taken together, these findings reveal a potential use for normal commensal bacterium s. epidermidis to activate tlr2 signaling and induce antimicrobial peptide expression, thus enabling the skin to  mount an enhanced response to pathogens.

TI  == antioxidant, antibacterial and antigiardial activities of walsura robusta roxb.
AB  == walsura robusta roxb. (family: meliaceae) is a well-known multi-purpose medicinal plant, and has been employed for a wide range of disease conditions without documented scientific data. in the current study, four pure isolated compounds, 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl beta-d-glucopyranoside (1), turpinionoside a (2), (+)-lyoniresinol 3alpha-o-beta-d-glucopyranoside (3) and (-)-lyoniresinol 3alpha-o-beta-d-glucopyranoside (4), were isolated from the leaves and twigs of w. robusta. biological evaluation for free radical scavenging, antibacterial and  antigiardial activities was performed. we investigated antioxidant effects of the crude extracts as well as the isolated compounds using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (dpph), hydroxyl radical (oh), and superoxide anion (o(2)) scavenging assays. three phenolic glucosides (1, 3 and 4) were found to possess strong antioxidant activity. they scavenged dpph(*) with ic(50) values in the range of 51.5-86.6 microm. we also detected the superoxide dismutase-like activities in compounds 3 and 4 which are lignan glucosides, demonstrating potent superoxide scavenging activity with ic(50) values in the range of 0.8 and 0.7 microm, respectively. other biological activities including  antibacterial and antigiardial assays were carried out. preliminary results demonstrated that most extracts, except the diethyl ether extract, exhibited inhibition zones against all gram-positive bacteria including bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, and s. pyogenes. aqueous extracts of this plant species could inhibit gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria such as escherichia coli, salmonella typhi and shigella sonnei. however, the determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of w. robusta on all tested bacterial strains  showed only weak activity, and their mbcs were greater than 25 mg ml(-1). for antigiardial activity, incubation with 2 x 10(5) trophozoites ml(-1) of the culture medium with the crude extracts at concentration ranged from 31.25 to 1000 microg ml(-1) demonstrated no activity (mic > 1000 microg ml(-1)).

TI  == use of natural antimicrobials to increase antibiotic susceptibility of drug resistant bacteria.
AB  == plant-derived antibacterial compounds may be of value as a novel means for controlling antibiotic resistant zoonotic pathogens which contaminate food animals and their products. individual activity of natural antimicrobials (eugenol, thymol, carvacrol, cinnamaldehyde, allyl isothiocyanate (ait)) and activity when paired with an antibiotic was studied using broth microdilution and checkerboard methods. in the latter assays, fractional inhibitory concentration (fic) values were calculated to characterize interactions between the inhibitors. bacteria tested were chosen because of their resistance to at least one antibiotic which had a known genetic basis. substantial susceptibility of these bacteria toward the natural antimicrobials and a considerable reduction in the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic's) of the antibiotics were noted when paired combinations of antimicrobial and antibiotic were used. in the interaction study, thymol and carvacrol were found to be highly effective in reducing the resistance of salmonella typhimurium sgi 1 (tet a) to ampicillin, tetracycline, penicillin, bacitracin, erythromycin and novobiocin (fic<0.4) and resistance of streptococcus pyogenes ermb to erythromycin (fic<0.5). with escherichia coli n00  666, thymol and cinnamaldehyde were found to have a similar effect (fic<0.4) in reducing the mic's of ampicillin, tetracycline, penicillin, erythromycin and novobiocin. carvacrol, thymol (fic<0.3) and cinnamaldehyde (fic<0.4) were effective against staphylococcus aureus blaz and in reducing the mic's of ampicillin, penicillin and bacitracin. allyl isothiocyanate (ait) was effective in reducing the mic of erythromycin (fic<0.3) when tested against s. pyogenes. fewer combinations were found to be synergistic when the decrease in viable population (log dp) was calculated. together, fractional inhibitory concentrations < or = 0.5 and log dp<-1 indicated synergistic action between four natural antimicrobials and as many as three antibiotics to which these bacteria were normally resistant.

TI  == bactericidal performance of visible-light responsive titania photocatalyst with silver nanostructures.
AB  == background: titania dioxide (tio(2)) photocatalyst is primarily induced by ultraviolet light irradiation. visible-light responsive anion-doped tio(2) photocatalysts contain higher quantum efficiency under sunlight and can be used safely in indoor settings without exposing to biohazardous ultraviolet light. the antibacterial efficiency, however, remains to be further improved. methodology/principal findings: using thermal reduction method, here we synthesized silver-nanostructures coated tio(2) thin films that contain a high visible-light responsive antibacterial property. among our tested titania substrates including tio(2), carbon-doped tio(2) [tio(2) (c)] and nitrogen-doped  tio(2) [tio(2) (n)], tio(2) (n) showed the best performance after silver coating. the synergistic antibacterial effect results approximately 5 log reductions of surviving bacteria of escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus and acinetobacter baumannii. scanning electron microscope analysis indicated that crystalline silver formed unique wire-like nanostructures on tio(2) (n) substrates, while formed relatively straight and thicker rod-shaped precipitates on the other two titania materials. conclusion/significance: our results suggested that proper forms of silver on various titania materials could  further influence the bactericidal property.

TI  == small variable segments constitute a major type of diversity of bacterial genomes at the species level.
AB  == background: analysis of large scale diversity in bacterial genomes has mainly focused on elements such as pathogenicity islands, or more generally, genomic islands. these comprise numerous genes and confer important phenotypes, which are present or absent depending on strains. we report that despite this widely accepted notion, most diversity at the species level is composed of much smaller  dna segments, 20 to 500 bp in size, which we call microdiversity. results: we performed a systematic analysis of the variable segments detected by multiple whole genome alignments at the dna level on three species for which the greatest  number of genomes have been sequenced: escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pyogenes. among the numerous sites of variability, 62 to 73% were loci of microdiversity, many of which were located within genes. they contribute to phenotypic variations, as 3 to 6% of all genes harbor microdiversity, and 1 to 9% of total genes are located downstream from a microdiversity locus. microdiversity loci are particularly abundant in genes encoding membrane proteins. in-depth analysis of the e. coli alignments shows that most of the diversity does not correspond to known mobile or repeated elements, and it is likely that they were generated by illegitimate recombination. an intriguing class of microdiversity includes small blocks of highly diverged sequences, whose origin is discussed. conclusions: this analysis  uncovers the importance of this small-sized genome diversity, which we expect to  be present in a wide range of bacteria, and possibly also in many eukaryotic genomes.

TI  == [interpretive reading of the antibiogram in gram positive cocci].
AB  == resistance to methicillin in staphylococcus is related to the expression of the meca gene, and involves resistance to all beta-lactams, with the exception of the new cephalosporins, ceftobiprole and ceftaroline. breakpoints for interpretation  of this mechanism differ in s. aureus and in coagulase-negative species. for macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramins b, (mls(b)) the most frequent mechanism among resistant strains is expression of methylases (erm genes). topoisomerase changes caused by point mutations and expression of the efflux pump nora determine resistance to quinolones, but there are great differences in the activity of different compounds, which makes interpretative reading difficult. strains of s. aureus with intermediate susceptibility to glycopeptides (gisa strains) have been described, as well as highly-vancomycin-resistant isolates (vana isolates). in spain, there is a high percentage of s. pneumoniae strains intermediate or resistant to penicillin, and a low percentage of strains intermediate or resistant to third generation cephalosporins, due to mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. the most frequent phenotype of resistance to mls(b) in this species is caused by methylase production. resistance to quinolones is still uncommon, and is mainly related to mutations in parc/pare (low level) and in gyra. it is important to detect low level resistance due to its clinical implications. no strains of s. pyogenes resistant to penicillin have yet been described. in spain the most common phenotype of resistance to macrolides in s. pyogenes is determined by efflux pumps (mef genes), affecting 14- and 15-membered macrolides. e. faecalis is usually susceptible to ampicillin, in contrast to e. faecium. enterococci show intrinsic  low-level resistance to aminoglycosides, but still remain susceptible to the combination of these antimicrobials and cell-wall active agents. strains expressing different aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (high-level resistance) became resistant to the combination. glycopeptide-resistant strains of enterococci are uncommon in spain, but nosocomial outbreaks due to vana enterococci and case reports due to vanb2 enterococci have been recently reported.

AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the potential of delivering a combination therapy, containing mannitol (a sugar alcohol with osmotic characteristics), and  ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (an antibacterial fluoroquinolone), as a dry powder inhaler (dpi) formulation for inhalation. single and combination powders were produced by spray drying ciprofloxacin and mannitol, from aqueous solution, at different ratios and under controlled conditions, as to obtain similar particle size distributions. each formulation was characterised using laser diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic vapour sorption, x-ray powder diffraction, and colloidal force microscopy. the in vitro  aerosol performance of each formulation was studied using an aerolizer dpi device and a multi-stage liquid impinger (analysed using high performance liquid chromatography). in addition, a disk diffusion test was performed to assess the in vitro antimicrobial activity of each formulation and starting materials. all formulations had similar particle size distributions, however, the morphology, thermal properties and moisture sorption was dependent on the relative percentages of each component. in general, the combination formulation containing 50% (w/w) mannitol appeared to have the best aerosol performance, good stability  and lowest particle cohesion (as measured by colloid probe microscopy). furthermore, of the formulations tested, mannitol did not appear to alter the effectiveness of the ciprofloxacin antimicrobial activity to staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pyogenes. the combination of co-spray-dried mannitol and ciprofloxacin from a dpi is an attractive approach to promote mucous clearance in the respiratory tract while simultaneously treating local chronic infection, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis.

TI  == impetigo update: new challenges in the era of methicillin resistance.
AB  == impetigo is a bacterial infection of the superficial epidermis most commonly seen in infants and children. it is clinically characterized by crusted erosions or ulcers that may arise as a primary infection in which bacterial invasion occurs through minor breaks in the cutaneous surface or a secondary infection of a preexisting dermatosis or infestation. impetigo occurs in 2 forms: bullous and nonbullous. staphylococcus aureus currently is the most common overall cause of impetigo, but streptococcus pyogenes remains an important cause in developing nations. community-acquired methicillin-resistant s aureus (ca-mrsa) poses a challenge because of its enhanced virulence and increasing prevalence in children. for limited uncomplicated impetigo, either topical mupirocin or fusidic acid is as effective if not more effective than systemic antibiotics. for extensive or complicated impetigo, systemic antibiotics may be warranted, but beta-lactam antibiotics should be avoided if methicillin-resistant s aureus (mrsa) is suspected.

TI  == evaluation of alternative methods for the disinfection of toothbrushes.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate alternative methods for the disinfection of toothbrushes considering that most of the previously proposed methods are expensive and cannot be easily implemented. two-hundred toothbrushes with standardized dimensions and bristles were included in the study. the toothbrushes were divided into 20 experimental groups (n = 10), according to microorganism considered and chemical agent used. the toothbrushes were contaminated in vitro by standardized suspensions of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus or candida albicans. the following disinfectants were tested: 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate, 50% white vinegar, a triclosan-containing dentifrice solution, and a perborate-based tablet solution.  the disinfection method was immersion in the disinfectant for 10 min. after the disinfection procedure, the number of remaining microbial cells was evaluated. the values of cfu/toothbrush of each group of microorganism after disinfection were compared by kruskal-wallis anova and dunn's test for multiple comparisons (5%). the chlorhexidine digluconate solution was the most effective disinfectant. the triclosan-based dentifrice solution promoted a significant reduction of all microorganisms' counts in relation to the control group. as to the disinfection with 50% vinegar, a significant reduction was observed for all the microorganisms, except for c. albicans. the sodium perborate solution was the less effective against the tested microorganisms. solutions based on triclosan-containing dentifrice may be considered effective, nontoxic, cost-effective, and an easily applicable alternative for the disinfection of toothbrushes. the vinegar solution reduced the presence of s. aureus, s. mutans and s. pyogenes on toothbrushes.

TI  == intracellular persisting staphylococcus aureus is the major pathogen in recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  == background: the two major indications for tonsillectomy are recurrent tonsillitis (rt) and peritonsillar abscess (pta). unlike ptas, which are primarily treated surgically, rt is often cured by tonsillectomy only after a series of failed drug therapy attempts. although the bacteriological background of rt has been studied, the reason for the lack of success of conservative therapeutic approaches is not  well understood. methods: in a prospective study, tonsil specimens from 130 rt patients and 124 pta patients were examined for the presence of extra- and intracellular bacteria using antibiotic protection assays. staphylococcus aureus  isolates from rt patients were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  (pfge), spa-typing and mscramm-gene-pcr. their ability for biofilm formation was  tested and their cell invasiveness was confirmed by a flow cytometric invasion assay (facs), fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) and immunohistochemistry.  findings: s. aureus was the predominant species (57.7%) in rt patients, whereas streptococcus pyogenes was most prevalent (20.2%) in pta patients. three different assays (facs, fish, antibiotic protection assay) showed that nearly all rt-associated s. aureus strains were located inside tonsillar cells. correspondingly, the results of the mscramm-gene-pcrs confirmed that 87% of these s. aureus isolates were invasive strains and not mere colonizers. based upon pfge analyses of genomic dna and on spa-gene typing the vast majority of the s. aureus isolates belonged to different clonal lineages. conclusions: our results demonstrate that intracellular residing s. aureus is the most common cause of rt  and indicate that s. aureus uses this location to survive the effects of antibiotics and the host immune response. a german translation of the abstract is provided as supplementary material (abstract s1).

TI  == cem-101 activity against gram-positive organisms.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cem-101, a new fluoroketolide, was determined against gram-positive organisms with various macrolide susceptibility profiles. experiments for determination of the mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs), timed killing, single-step and multistep mutation rates, the erythromycin induction of resistance, postantibiotic effect (pae), and drug interactions were  performed for cem-101; and the results were compared to those obtained with telithromycin, macrolides, and lincosamides. the mbcs of cem-101 remained lower overall than those of telithromycin, and cem-101 displayed a 2-fold greater potency than the ketolide. timed-killing curve testing showed that cem-101 had greater bactericidal activity than telithromycin (a >or=3-log(10)-cfu/ml decrease in the initial inoculum at 24 h) against the staphylococcal isolates tested. the  propensity of cem-101 to cause resistance was low, as determined from the rates of resistance determined in single-step mutational studies (<10(-8) or 10(-9)). in multipassaging studies, mutants of two strains (both of which were usa300 isolates) resistant to cem-101 emerged. that number was comparable to the number  resistant to clindamycin but less than the number resistant to telithromycin. erythromycin induced cem-101 resistance in staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae, similar to telithromycin; however, in seven of eight beta-hemolytic streptococci, cem-101 resistance induction was not observed. cem-101 showed a significant concentration- and exposure-dependent pae against the strains tested, with the values ranging from 2.3 to 6.1 h for gram-positive organisms (these times were longer than those for telithromycin). no antagonism was found in synergy analyses, with enhanced inhibition being most noted for combinations with cem-101 and ceftriaxone, gentamicin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. overall, this new antimicrobial agent (cem-101) showed good antimicrobial characteristics compared with those of the agents in its class and exhibited measured parameter values similar or superior to those of utilized comparators, indicating that cem-101 warrants further clinical evaluation.

AB  == phage endolysin targets the integrate cell wall and attack bonds in the peptidoglycan, resulting in degradation of bacteria. it features two or three domain structures, involving one or two catalytic domains and one binding domain. endolysin is a promising antibiotic agent against gram-positive bacteria pathogen, such as streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus. compared to antibiotics, it is more specific and tested bacteria show no resistance to lysin. therefore, it's a feasible measure for solving drug resistant problem. beyond this, it is highly active and rapid lysis  efficiency and has synergy effect when used together or with other antibiotics. antibody against endolysin will not neutralize its activity. so endolysin treatment may be a new approach for preventing and controlling of bacteria pathogen.

TI  == complement inhibition by gram-positive pathogens: molecular mechanisms and therapeutic implications.
AB  == the plasma proteins of the complement system are essential in the innate immune response against bacteria. complement labels bacteria with opsonins to support phagocytosis and generates chemoattractants to attract phagocytes to the site of  infection. in turn, bacterial human pathogens have evolved different strategies to specifically impair the complement response. here, we review the large arsenal of complement inhibitors produced by the gram-positive pathogens staphylococcus aureus and group a streptococcus. we discuss how these bacterial molecules provide us with new tools to treat both infectious and inflammatory disease conditions in humans.

(z)-5-(2,3,4-trifluorobenzylidene)rhodanine (1) inhibited the growth of s. aureus at 0.5 microg/ml and mrsa at 32 microg/ml. stronger antimicrobial activity against s. aureus was observed for compounds bearing the rhodanine ring than those containing other heterocyclic moieties. neither of the  compounds 1-11 inhibited the growth of gram-negative bacteria e. coli or p. aeruginosa.

TI  == how microorganisms avoid phagocyte attraction.
AB  == microorganisms have developed several mechanisms to modulate the host immune system to increase their survival and propagation in the host. their presence in  the host is not only revealed by self-produced peptides but also through host-derived chemokines and active complement fragments. these so-called chemoattractants are recognized by g protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs) expressed  on leukocyte cell membranes. activation of gpcrs triggers leukocyte activation and guides their recruitment to the site of infection. therefore, gpcrs play a central role in leukocyte trafficking leading to microbial clearance. it is therefore not surprising that microorganisms are able to sabotage this arm of the immune response. different microorganisms have evolved a variety of tactics to modulate gpcr activation. here, we review the mechanisms and proteins used by major human pathogens and less virulent microorganisms that affect gpcr signaling. while viruses generally produce receptor and chemoattractant mimics, parasites and bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, porphyromonas gingivalis, and bordetella pertussis secrete proteins that affect receptor signaling, directly antagonize receptors, cleave stimuli, and even prevent stimulus generation. as the large arsenal of gpcr modulators aids prolonged microbial persistence in the host, their study provides us a better understanding of microbial pathogenesis.

TI  == microbial aetiologic agents associated with pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts.
AB  == pulmonary infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunosuppressed patients. the aim of this study was to determine the etiologic agents and predisposing factors associated with pneumonia infections in immunocompromised patients. cross-sectional survey of 100 immunocompromised patients due to hiv and mycobacterium tuberculosis infections were enlisted for the study. the patients completed a structured questionnaire to abstract information on demographic features and risk factors. sputum samples were collected from the patients with clinical suspicion of having pneumonia and the sputa examined by cultural methods. the tuberculosis patients had the highest number of isolates, 119 (70%) while those with co-infections of hiv/aids and tuberculosis had 41(24.1%) and those with only hiv infection were 10 (5.9%). the  distribution of isolates were as follows, staphylococcus aureus 63 (37.9%), streptococcus pyogenes 44 (25.9%), streptococcus pneumoniae 27 (15.9%), candida albicans 24 (14.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae 7 (4.1%), proteus mirabilis 4 (2.4%) and escherichia coli 1 (0.5%). those with previous history of alcoholism and tobacco smoking had relatively high isolates. this study demonstrated that secondary infections are prevalent in the immunocompromised patients due to hiv/aids and tb or co-infection with tb/hiv-aids. this may lead to drug resistance, dots or haart programme, thereby leading to high mortality and morbidity.

AB  == myonecrosis remains one of the severest manifestations of skin and soft tissue infections. clostridia (c. perfringens, c. novyi, c. septicum, c. sordellii, c. histolyticum) are dominant and staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, and bacteriodes fragilis are much less in the etiology of myonecrosis. cases of gas gangrene have recently become more frequent among injection drug users all over the world. russia has become the largest opiate market in europe and consumption of these narcotic drugs is annually growing. in  the russian federation, a larger number of injection drug users uniquely results  in a rise of cases of clostridium- and mixed flora-induced myonecrosis. gas gangrene in hiv-positive drug abusers seems to rapidly progress to multiple organ failure and to show high death rates, rather than to develop a localized form. the analyzed case of mixed flora-induced gas gangrene is of interest to physicians of any specialties who can encounter this wound infection in hiv-positive patients.

TI  == bactericidal and anti-inflammatory properties of a standardized echinacea extract (echinaforce): dual actions against respiratory bacteria.
AB  == common symptoms of upper respiratory infections, such as sore throat, cough, and  inflammation, are often caused by bacteria, sometimes as a complication of virus  infection. extracts of echinacea purpurea (asteraceae) have been advocated traditionally for use by individuals suffering from these symptoms, although the  underlying basis for the beneficial effects of echinacea is not known. we hypothesized that echinacea could inactivate certain respiratory bacteria and could also reverse inflammatory effects caused by these bacteria in epithelial cells. in order to test this we used a commercial standardized extract of echinacea purpurea (echinaforce), and a novel cytokine array system designed to measure simultaneously the levels of 20 different cytokines secreted by bronchial epithelial cell cultures in response to infection. streptococcus pyogenes (group  a strep), which is often associated with sore throat and more severe pulmonary infections, was readily inactivated by echinacea, which also completely reversed  the cellular pro-inflammatory response. hemophilus influenzae and legionella pneumophila were also readily inactivated, and their pro-inflammatory responses reversed. staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant and sensitive strains) and mycobacterium smegmatis were less sensitive to the bactericidal effects of echinacea however, but their pro-inflammatory responses were still completely reversed. in contrast some other pathogens tested, including candida albicans, were relatively resistant. thus echinaforce) exerts a dual action against several important respiratory bacteria, a killing effect and an anti-inflammatory effect. these results support the concept of using a standardized echinacea preparation to control symptoms associated with bacterial respiratory infections.

TI  == comparative genomics and transduction potential of enterococcus faecalis temperate bacteriophages.
AB  == to determine the relative importance of temperate bacteriophage in the horizontal gene transfer of fitness and virulence determinants of enterococcus faecalis, a panel of 47 bacteremia isolates were treated with the inducing agents mitomycin c, norfloxacin, and uv radiation. thirty-four phages were purified from culture supernatants and discriminated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and  restriction mapping. from these analyses the genomes of eight representative phages were pyrosequenced, revealing four distinct groups of phages. three groups of phages, phifl1 to 3, were found to be sequence related, with phifl1a to c and  phifl2a and b sharing the greatest identity (87 to 88%), while phifl3a and b share 37 to 41% identity with phifl1 and 2. phifl4a shares 3 to 12% identity with the phages phifl1 to 3. the phifl3a and b phages possess a high dna sequence identity with the morphogenesis and lysis modules of lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris prophages. homologs of the streptococcus mitis platelet binding phage tail proteins, pbla and pblb, are encoded on each sequenced e. faecalis phage. few other phage genes encoding potential virulence functions were identified, and there was little evidence of carriage of lysogenic conversion genes distal to endolysin, as has been observed with genomes of many temperate phages from the opportunist pathogens staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. e. faecalis jh2-2 lysogens were generated using the eight phages, and these were examined for their relative fitness in galleria mellonella. several lysogens exhibited different effects upon survival of g. mellonella compared to their isogenic parent. the eight phages were tested for their ability to package host dna, and three were shown to be very effective for generalized transduction of naive host cells of the laboratory strains og1rf and jh2-2.

AB  == we have reported in this journal in vitro susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics every year since 1992. in this paper, we report the results of an  analysis of in vitro susceptibilities of 12,919 clinical isolates from 72 centers in japan to selected antibiotics in 2007 compared with the results from previous  years. the common respiratory pathogens, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae maintained a high susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (fqs). the resistance of s. pyogenes to macrolides has been increasing every year and this was especially clear this year. most strains of enterobacteriaceae except for escherichia coli showed a high susceptibility to fqs. almost 30% of e. coli strains were resistant to fqs and the resistance increased further this year. fqs resistance of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was approximately 95% with the exception of 45% for sitafloxacin (stfx). fqs resistance of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) was low at about 10%. fqs resistance of  methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci (mrcns) was higher than that of methicillin-susceptible coagulase negative staphylococci (mscns), but it  was lower than that of mrsa. however, fqs resistance of mscns was higher than that of mssa. fqs resistance of enterococcus faecalis was 22.5% to 29.6%, while that of enterococcusfaecium was more than 85% except for stfx (58.3%). in clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa derived from urinary tract infections, fqs resistance was 21-27%, which was higher than that of p. aeruginosa from respiratory tract infections at 13-21%, which was the same trend  as in past years. multidrug resistant strains accounted for 5.6% in the urinary tract and 1.8% in the respiratory tract. acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to fqs. the carbapenem resistant strains, which present a problem  at present, accounted for 2.7%. neisseria gonorrhoeae showed high resistance of 86-88% to fqs. the results of the present survey indicated that although methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococci, e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and n.  gonorrhoeae showed resistance tendencies, and other species maintained high susceptibility rates more than 90% against fqs, which have been used clinically for over 15 years.

TI  == rapid exchange of bound adp on the staphylococcus aureus replication initiation protein dnaa.
AB  == in escherichia coli, regulatory inactivation of the replication initiator dnaa occurs after initiation as a result of hydrolysis of bound atp to adp, but it has been unknown how dnaa is controlled to coordinate cell growth and chromosomal replication in gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus. this study examined the roles of atp binding and its hydrolysis in the regulation of the s.  aureus dnaa activity. in vitro, s. aureus dnaa melted s. aureus oric in the presence of atp but not adp by a mechanism independent of atp hydrolysis. unlike  e. coli dnaa, binding of adp to s. aureus dnaa was unstable. as a result, at physiological concentrations of atp, adp bound to s. aureus dnaa was rapidly exchanged for atp, thereby regenerating the ability of dnaa to form the open complex in vitro. therefore, we examined whether formation of adp-dnaa participates in suppression of replication initiation in vivo. induction of the r318h mutant of the aaa+ sensor 2 protein, which has decreased intrinsic atpase activity, caused over-initiation of chromosome replication in s. aureus, suggesting that formation of adp-dnaa suppresses the initiation step in s. aureus. together with the biochemical features of s. aureus dnaa, the weak ability to convert atp-dnaa into adp-dnaa and the instability of adp-dnaa, these  results suggest that there may be unidentified system(s) for reducing the cellular ratio of atp-dnaa to adp-dnaa in s. aureus and thereby delaying the re-initiation of dna replication.

TI  == tumor-associated and microbial proteases compromise host igg effector functions by a single cleavage proximal to the hinge.
AB  == the successful elimination of pathogenic cells and microorganisms by the humoral  immune system relies on effective interactions between host immunoglobulins and fc gamma receptors on effector cells, in addition to the complement system. essential ig motifs that direct those interactions reside within the conserved igg lower hinge/ch2 interface. we noted that a group of tumor-related and microbial proteases cleaved human igg1s in that region, and the "nick" of just one of the heavy chains profoundly inhibited igg1 effector functions. we focused  on igg1 monoclonal antibodies (mabs) since igg1 is the most abundant human subclass and demonstrates robust fc-mediated effector functions. the loss of fc-mediated cell killing activities was correlated with diminished binding to the fc gamma family of receptors, but a similar decrease in affinity was not observed toward the fcrn receptor that maintains igg in circulation. endogenous human igg  cleavage products of comparable size to mabs with the single cleavage were detected by western blot analysis in synovial fluid from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and in breast carcinoma extracts. their detection is problematic under  physiological conditions, since there is no loss of structure, and antigen-binding capability is unaffected. these findings suggest that within the  hostile proteolytic microenvironments associated with many diseases, key effector functions of host iggs, or therapeutic abs, may be compromised.

TI  == group a streptococcus: a loser in the battle with autophagy.
AB  == autophagy is an intracellular bulk degradation/recycling system for turning over  cellular constituents. in one of the more remarkable findings among the recent developments in the field of autophagy, it was found that autophagy can also eliminate bacteria that invade host cells. the first evidence of this phenomenon  came from an analysis of group a streptococcus (gas), the etiological agent underlying diverse human diseases. this bacterium is often internalized into nonphagocytic cells via the endocytic pathway, and then escapes from endosomes into the cytoplasm by secreting streptolysin o. the bacteria that escape into the cytoplasm induce and are captured by a unique membranous structure, which shares  characteristics and molecular machinery with canonical autophagosomes but has some distinctions, including its large size. subsequent fusion with lysosomes causes the death of most intracellular gas. these findings have opened up a new field of innate immunity: the intracellular immune system against pathogens that  penetrate the first defense of the endocytic pathway. the role of autophagy in staphylococcus aureus infection is also discussed.

AB  == an outbreak of infectious keratoconjunctivitis (ikc) occurred in semidomesticated reindeer (rangifer tarandus tarandus) in troms county, norway, in february 2009.  twenty-eight animals with clinical symptoms and 12 apparently healthy animals were investigated. they ranged in age from calves of the year to 4-year-old animals (mean, 1.9 years; standard deviation, +/-0.9). the seroprevalence of antibodies against cervid herpesvirus 2 (cvhv2) was 86% in animals with ikc and 42% in unaffected animals. for the 28 clinically affected animals, cvhv2 was detected by pcr in swabs obtained from the eye (82%), nose (64%), and vagina (24%), and cvhv2 was isolated from eye swabs from 8 animals. virus was not isolated from clinically unaffected animals but was detected by pcr in eye swab samples from five of them. the viral activity, assessed by the ability to cause a cytopathic effect in cell culture, increased with the severity of clinical symptoms, but in severe clinical cases, virus was absent and secondary bacterial  infections were dominant. moraxella sp. isolates were obtained from seven animals, and those from two animals were identified as moraxella bovoculi. staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sp., and arcanobacterium pyogenes were also  isolated. it is concluded that cvhv2, which is endemic in reindeer, can cause ikc, probably most commonly as a primary infection of calves. this can be a very  painful and devastating disease of economic importance for reindeer herders. this is the first report of cvhv2 as the primary agent of ikc in reindeer. this is also the first isolation of this virus in reindeer under natural herding conditions.

TI  == [etiology, resistance and diagnostic techniques in skin and skin structure infections].
AB  == skin and soft tissue infections (ssti) are common and, generally, uncomplicated at the time of initial presentation. however, these infections can worsen quickly when there are delays in diagnosis and treatment. the clinical presentation of most ssti is the culmination of a microbial three-step process as follow: i) bacterial adherence to host cells; ii) invasion of tissue with evasion of host defences, and iii) elaboration of toxins. even if the microbiology of wounds has  been actively investigated in recent years, there is still much to be learned about the microbial mechanisms that induce infection and prevent wound healing. there are also several means by which bacteria penetrate the skin barrier. the most common route is through a break in the barrier (lacerations, bite wounds, scratches, instrumentations, pre-existing skin conditions, wounds or ulcers, burns and surgery); other routes of penetration include contiguous spread from adjacent infections (e.g. osteomyelitis), entry of water into the skin pores, and, rarely, haematogenous seeding (i.e septic emboli). from what it was said, many microorganisms, above all from the normal skin microbiota, can be involved in these often polymicrobial infections, with gram-positives such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, corynebacterium spp being predominant. many other aerobic and anaerobic species,  including gram-negative bacilli, can also be involved. even if the diagnosis of most ssti is based on clinical examination, laboratory investigations, guided by  clinical information, can help to confirm the diagnosis and elucidate the characteristics of specific pathogens. these microbiological investigations may include blood cultures, tissue swabs with culture, and needle aspiration. in rapidly progressing infections, empirical therapy is essential, although microbiological data are important in confirming subsequently that the chosen regimen is appropriate. furthermore, the number of microorganisms becoming resistant to many usual drugs and the changing microbial epidemiology of these infections, such as the emergence of ca-mrsa, required a constant cooperation between the microbiology lab and the clinician in order to address microbiological aspects that can be critical to the successful management of ssti.

TI  == selective antimicrobial action is provided by phenol-soluble modulins derived from staphylococcus epidermidis, a normal resident of the skin.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides serve as a first line of innate immune defense against invading organisms such as bacteria and viruses. in this study, we hypothesized that peptides produced by a normal microbial resident of human skin, staphylococcus epidermidis, might also act as an antimicrobial shield and contribute to normal defense at the epidermal interface. we show by circular dichroism and tryptophan spectroscopy that phenol-soluble modulins (psms) gamma and delta produced by s. epidermidis have an alpha-helical character and a strong lipid membrane interaction similar to mammalian amps such as ll-37. both psms directly induced lipid vesicle leakage and exerted selective antimicrobial action against skin pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus. psms functionally cooperated with each other and ll-37 to enhance antimicrobial action. moreover, psms reduced group a streptococcus (gas) but not the survival of s. epidermidis on mouse skin. thus, these data suggest that the production of psmgamma and psmdelta by s. epidermidis can benefit cutaneous immune defense by selectively inhibiting the survival of skin pathogens while maintaining the normal skin microbiome.

TI  == suppurative lymphadenitis.
AB  == suppurative lymphadenitis is an important and common form of soft tissue infection. most acute cases of suppurative lymphadenitis are caused by staphylococcus aureus or by streptococcus pyogenes. empiric antibiotic therapy is frequently successful in the early stages of the disease process, but increasing  prevalence of methicillin-resistant s. aureus in particular has necessitated a shift in antibiotic choice that is dictated primarily by specific local resistance patterns. several other organisms and noninfectious inflammatory processes may give rise to a clinical syndrome suggestive of suppurative lymphadenitis. failure to respond to empiric antibiotics should trigger a diagnostic re-evaluation to determine the need for surgical intervention and/or the possibility of alternative microbiologic diagnoses.

TI  == the disruption of bacterial membrane integrity through ros generation induced by  nanohybrids of silver and clay.
AB  == nanohybrids, synthesized via silver nitrate reduction in the presence of silicate clay, exhibit a high potency against bacterial growth. the plate-like clay, due to its anionic surface charges and a large surface area, serves as the support for the formation of silver nanoparticles (agnps) approximately 30 nm in diameter. the nanohybrid consisting of ag/silicate at a 7/93 weight ratio inhibited the growth of dermal pathogens including staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pyrogens, as well as the methicillin- and oxacillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa and orsa). scanning electron microscope revealed that these nanohybrids were adherent on the surface of individual bacteria. the thin silicate plates provide a surface for immobilizing  agnps in one highly concentrated area but prevent them from entering the cell membrane. subsequent cytotoxicity studies indicated that surface contact with the reduced agnps on clay is sufficient to initiate cell death. this toxicity is related to a loss in membrane integrity due to reactive oxygen species (ros) generation. the hybridization of agnps on clay surface is viable for generating a new class of nanohybrids exhibiting mild cytotoxicity but high efficacy for battling drug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == in vitro ciprofloxacin resistance patterns of gram-positive bacteria isolated from clinical specimens in a teaching hospital in saudi arabia.
AB  == background: over the last few decades the ever-increasing level of bacterial resistance to antimicrobials has been a cause of worldwide concern. fluoroquinolones, particularly ciprofloxacin has been used indiscriminately for both gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections. the increased use of ciprofloxacin has led to a progressive loss of bacterial susceptibility to this antibiotic. therefore it is necessary to have update knowledge of resistance pattern of bacteria to this antibiotic so that alternate appropriate antibiotics  can be used for ciprofloxacin-resistant bacterial infections. objective: to evaluate the trends of ciprofloxacin resistance pattern in commonly isolated gram-positive bacteria over time in a saudi arabian teaching hospital. methods: a retrospective analysis was carried out for ciprofloxacin susceptibility patterns  of 5534 isolates of gram-positive bacteria isolated from clinical specimens submitted to microbiology laboratories at king fahd hospital of the university (kfhu), al-khobar, saudi arabia during the period from january 2002 to august 2005. results: increase in ciprofloxacin resistance rates with some fluctuations, among these isolates, were observed. for staphylococcus aureus, it varied from 4.62, 1.83, 7.01 and 3.98%, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) 97.92, 97.75, 87.01 and 88.26%, streptococcus pyogenes 5.35, 4.47, 14.44 and 3.53% during the years 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively. cirprofloxacin resistance during the years 2002, 2004 and 2005 for other isolates was as follows: streptococcus pneumoniae, 30.23, 23.02 and 26.47%; enterococcus group d, 43.05, 20.68 and 57.03% and non-enterococcus group d, 62.96, 76.92 and 87.50% respectively. conclusion: ciprofloxacin resistance in gram-positive bacterial clinical isolates particularly staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) enterococcus group d, and non-enterococcus group d,  has greatly increased and ciprofloxacin no more remains the drug of choice for these infections.

TI  == high burden of impetigo and scabies in a tropical country.
AB  == background: impetigo and scabies are endemic diseases in many tropical countries; however the epidemiology of these diseases is poorly understood in many areas, particularly in the pacific. methodology/principal findings: we conducted three epidemiological studies in 2006 and 2007 to determine the burden of disease due to impetigo and scabies in children in fiji using simple and easily reproducible  methodology. two studies were performed in primary school children (one study was a cross-sectional study and the other a prospective cohort study over ten months) and one study was performed in infants (cross-sectional). the prevalence of active impetigo was 25.6% (95% ci 24.1-27.1) in primary school children and 12.2% (95% ci 9.3-15.6) in infants. the prevalence of scabies was 18.5% (95% ci 17.2-19.8) in primary school children and 14.0% (95% ci 10.8-17.2) in infants. the incidence density of active impetigo, group a streptococcal (gas) impetigo, staphylococcus aureus impetigo and scabies was 122, 80, 64 and 51 cases per 100 child-years respectively. impetigo was strongly associated with scabies infestation (odds ratio, or, 2.4, 95% ci 1.6-3.7) and was more common in indigenous fijian children when compared with children of other ethnicities (or 3.6, 95% ci 2.7-4.7). the majority of cases of active impetigo in the children in our study were caused by gas. s. aureus was also a common cause (57.4% in school  aged children and 69% in infants). conclusions/significance: these data suggest that the impetigo and scabies disease burden in children in fiji has been underestimated, and possibly other tropical developing countries in the pacific.  these diseases are more than benign nuisance diseases and consideration needs to  be given to expanded public health initiatives to improve their control.

TI  == sensitivity of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and c-reactive protein in childhood bone and joint infections.
AB  == in addition to the examination of clinical signs, several laboratory markers have been measured for diagnostics and monitoring of pediatric septic bone and joint infections. traditionally erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr) and leukocyte cell count have been used, whereas c-reactive protein (crp) has gained in popularity.  we monitored 265 children at ages 3 months to 15 years with culture-positive osteoarticular infections with a predetermined series of esr, crp, and leukocyte  count measurements. on admission, esr exceeded 20 mm/hour in 94% and crp exceeded 20 mg/l in 95% of the cases, the mean (+/- standard error of the mean) being 51 +/- 2 mm/hour and 87 +/- 4 mg/l, respectively. esr normalized in 24 days and crp  in 10 days. elevated crp gave a slightly better sensitivity in diagnostics than esr, but best sensitivity was gained with the combined use of esr and crp (98%).  elevated esr or crp was seen in all cases during the first 3 days. measuring esr  and crp on admission can help the clinician rule out an acute osteoarticular infection. crp normalizes faster than esr, providing a clear advantage in monitoring recovery. level of evidence: level ii, diagnostic study. see guidelines for authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of the medium chain fatty acids and their 1-monoglycerides was evaluated towards several gram-positive strains belonging to the genera staphylococcus, corynebacterium, bacillus, listeria and streptococcus. the 1-monoglycerides were more active than the fatty acids with monolaurin being  the most active compound. interesting effects were observed when the streptococcal strain streptococcus pyogenes was used as a test microorganism. first, blocking of the hydroxyl groups of the glycerol moiety of monolaurin led to a compound with remarkable antibacterial activity (mic, 3.9 microg/ml). secondly, synergistic relationships were observed between monolaurin and monocaprin as well as between monolaurin and the poorly active lauric acid when their two component mixtures were examined. the mixtures in which one of the components was 2-fold more predominant than the other one were much more active than the pure components taken individually. moreover, the presence of the components in ratio 1:1 was disadvantageous. synergistic relationships were also  found between monolaurin and monomyristin towards staphylococcus aureus 209 when  monomyristin was in the same quantity as monolaurin or in shortage.

TI  == real-time polymerase chain reaction-based identification of bacteria in milk samples from bovine clinical mastitis with no growth in conventional culturing.
AB  == in more than 30% of milk samples from clinical and subclinical bovine mastitis, bacteria fail to grow even after 48 h of conventional culture. the "no-growth" samples are problematic for mastitis laboratories, veterinarians, and dairy producers. this study provides the first investigation of the bacteriological etiology of such samples, using a real-time pcr-based commercial reagent kit. the assay targets the dna of the 11 most common bacterial species or groups in mastitis and the staphylococcal blaz gene (responsible for penicillin resistance) and can identify and quantify bacterial cells even if dead or growth-inhibited. a study was made of 79 mastitic milk samples with no-growth bacteria in conventional culture, originating from cows with clinical mastitis. of the 79 samples, 34 (43%) were positive for 1 (32 samples) or 2 (2 samples) of the target bacteria. the positive findings included 11 staphylococcus spp. (staphylococci other than staphylococcus aureus), 10 streptococcus uberis, 2 streptococcus dysgalactiae, 6 corynebacterium bovis, 3 staph. aureus, 1 escherichia coli, 1 enterococcus, and 1 arcanobacterium pyogenes. the positive samples contained as many as 10(3) to 10(7) bacterial genome copies per milliliter of milk. this study demonstrates that in nearly half of the clinical mastitis cases in which conventional culture failed to detect bacteria, mastitis pathogens were still present, often in substantial quantities. the clearly elevated n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase activity values of the milk samples, together with clinical signs of the infected cows and quarters, confirmed the diagnosis of clinical mastitis and indicated that real-time, pcr-based bacterial findings are  able to reveal bacteriological etiology. we conclude that all common mastitis bacteria can occur in large quantities in clinical mastitis samples that exhibit  no growth in conventional culture, and that the real-time pcr assay is a useful tool for bacteriological diagnosis of such milk samples. low bacterial concentration is commonly speculated to explain the no-growth milk samples. this  hypothesis is not supported by the results of the current study.

AB  == patients with atopic dermatitis (ad) are susceptible to cutaneous bacterial infection. when such patients develop infection, some have extensive impetiginized dermatitis with high fever. to clarify the risk factors for severe  impetiginized ad and its microbiological features, we reviewed clinical and microbiological data of 14 patients with impetiginized ad who were admitted to our hospital between the years 1999 and 2006. all patients had poorly controlled  ad with eczematous lesions on the extensive body surface. the mean age was 28.2 years (range 18-35). cultures of the lesional skin yielded both streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus in 12 patients. s. pyogenes alone was isolated in two cases. these observations suggest that poorly controlled ad in adults is a risk factor for severe impetiginized ad and that s. pyogenes might play an important role in the development of severe clinical symptoms.

TI  == topical retapamulin in the management of infected traumatic skin lesions.
AB  == retapamulin is a novel semisynthetic pleuromutilin antibiotic specifically designed for use as a topical agent. the unique mode of action by which retapamulin selectively inhibits bacterial protein synthesis differentiates it from other nonpleuromutilin antibacterial agents that target the ribosome or ribosomal factors, minimizing the potential for target-specific cross-resistance  with other antibacterial classes in current use. in vitro studies show that retapamulin has high potency against the gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and coagulase-negative staphylococci) commonly found in skin and skin-structure infections (sssis), including s. aureus strains  with resistance to agents such as macrolides, fusidic acid, or mupirocin, and other less common organisms associated with sssis, anaerobes, and common respiratory tract pathogens. clinical studies have shown that twice-daily topical retapamulin for 5 days is comparable to 10 days of oral cephalexin in the treatment of secondarily infected traumatic lesions. a 1% concentration of retapamulin ointment has been approved for clinical use as an easily applied treatment with a short, convenient dosing regimen for impetigo. given the novel mode of action, low potential for cross-resistance with established antibacterial agents, and high in vitro potency against many bacterial pathogens commonly recovered from sssis, retapamulin is a valuable enhancement over existing therapeutic options.

TI  == combinatorial expression of bacterial whole mevalonate pathway for the production of beta-carotene in e. coli.
AB  == the increased synthesis of building blocks of ipp (isopentenyl diphosphate) and dmapp (dimethylallyl diphosphate) through metabolic engineering is a way to enhance the production of carotenoids. using e. coli as a host, ipp and dmapp supply can be increased significantly through the introduction of foreign mva (mevalonate) pathway into it. the mva pathway is split into two parts with the top and bottom portions supplying mevalonate from acetyl-coa, and ipp and dmapp from mevalonate, respectively. the bottom portions of mva pathway from streptococcus pneumonia, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and saccharomyces cerevisiae were compared with exogenous  mevalonate supplementation for beta-carotene production in recombinant escherichia coli harboring beta-carotene synthesis genes. the e. coli harboring the bottom mva pathway of s. pneumoniae produced the highest amount of beta-carotene. the top portions of mva pathway were also compared and the top mva pathway of e. faecalis was found out to be the most efficient for mevalonate production in e. coli. the whole mva pathway was constructed by combining the bottom and top portions of mva pathway of s. pneumoniae and e. faecalis, respectively. the recombinant e. coli harboring the whole mva pathway and beta-carotene synthesis genes produced high amount of beta-carotene even without  exogenous mevalonate supplementation. when comparing various e. coli strains - mg1655, dh5alpha, s17-1, xl1-blue and bl21 - the dh5alpha was found to be the best beta-carotene producer. using glycerol as the carbon source for beta-carotene production was found to be superior to glucose, galactose, xylose and maltose. the recombinant e. coli dh5alpha harboring the whole mva pathway and beta-carotene synthesis genes produced beta-carotene of 465mg/l at glycerol concentration of 2% (w/v).

TI  == bacterial tracheitis: a multi-centre perspective.
AB  == the published literature on bacterial tracheitis is limited. we report the first  multi-centre study of bacterial tracheitis together with a concise review of the  literature. we conducted a retrospective study of cases admitted during the period 1993-2007 to 3 tertiary paediatric centres in the united kingdom and 1 in  australia. a total of 34 cases were identified. 31 patients (91%) required intubation. complications included cardiorespiratory arrest in 1, ards in 1, hypotension in 10, toxic shock syndrome in 1 and renal failure in 1 patient(s). staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly implicated bacterial organism, isolated from the respiratory tract in 55.8% of the cases overall. other pathogens commonly isolated from the respiratory tract included streptococcus pyogenes (5.9%), streptococcus pneumoniae (11.8%) and haemophilus influenzae (11.8%). viral coinfection was identified in 9 (31%) of the 29 cases in whom immunofluorescence testing was performed (influenza a in 4 cases; parainfluenza 1 in 2 cases; parainfluenza 3 in 2 cases; adenovirus in 1 case). the combined experience from 4 major paediatric intensive care units suggests that bacterial tracheitis remains a rare condition with an estimated incidence of approximately  0.1/100,000 children per year. short-term complications were common but long-term sequelae were rare. there were no fatal outcomes, which contrasts with the high historical mortality rates and likely reflects improvements in intensive care management.

TI  == genome dynamics in major bacterial pathogens.
AB  == pathogenic bacteria continuously encounter multiple forms of stress in their hostile environments, which leads to dna damage. with the new insight into biology offered by genome sequences, the elucidation of the gene content encoding proteins provides clues toward understanding the microbial lifestyle related to habitat and niche. campylobacter jejuni, haemophilus influenzae, helicobacter pylori, mycobacterium tuberculosis, the pathogenic neisseria, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus are major human pathogens causing detrimental morbidity and mortality at a global scale. an algorithm for the clustering of orthologs was established in order to identify whether orthologs of selected genes were present or absent in the genomes of the  pathogenic bacteria under study. based on the known genes for the various functions and their orthologs in selected pathogenic bacteria, an overview of the presence of the different types of genes was created. in this context, we focus on selected processes enabling genome dynamics in these particular pathogens, namely dna repair, recombination and horizontal gene transfer. an understanding of the precise molecular functions of the enzymes participating in dna metabolism and their importance in the maintenance of bacterial genome integrity has also, in recent years, indicated a future role for these enzymes as targets for therapeutic intervention.

TI  == gram-positive toxic shock syndromes.
AB  == toxic shock syndrome (tss) is an acute, multi-system, toxin-mediated illness, often resulting in multi-organ failure. it represents the most fulminant expression of a spectrum of diseases caused by toxin-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus). the importance of gram-positive organisms as pathogens is increasing, and tss is likely to be underdiagnosed in patients with staphylococcal or group a streptococcal infection who present with shock. tss results from the ability of bacterial toxins to act as superantigens, stimulating immune-cell expansion and rampant cytokine expression in a manner that bypasses normal mhc-restricted antigen processing. a repetitive cycle of cell stimulation and cytokine release results in a cytokine avalanche that causes tissue damage, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and organ dysfunction. specific therapy focuses on early identification of the illness, source control, and administration on antimicrobial agents including drugs capable of suppressing toxin production (eg, clindamycin, linezolid). intravenous immunoglobulin has the potential to neutralise superantigen and to mitigate subsequent tissue damage.

TI  == molecular recognition of diverse ligands by t-cell receptors.
AB  == t-cell receptors (tcrs) are structurally related to antibodies, and also interact with a diverse set of ligands. tcrs recognize foreign peptide antigens displayed  by major histocompatibility complex (mhc) molecules and foreign lipid-based antigens presented by cd1. these interactions initiate an immune response through t-cell activation. these critical surveillance and response initiation functions  of the adaptive immune system are not perfect, though, as tcr interactions with self antigens can lead to autoimmune disease. mutated peptides can also be recognized specifically by tcrs, and may be important in tumor immunity. tcrs are also bound specifically by a family of bacterial toxins called superantigens, which over-stimulate the immune system to cause numerous human diseases.

TI  == cervical lymphadenitis: etiology, diagnosis, and management.
AB  == cervical lymphadenopathy is a common problem in children. the condition most commonly represents a transient response to a benign local or generalized infection. acute bilateral cervical lymphadenitis is usually caused by a viral upper respiratory tract infection or streptococcal pharyngitis. acute unilateral  cervical lymphadenitis is caused by streptococcal or staphylococcal infection in  40% to 80% of cases. common causes of subacute or chronic lymphadenitis include cat-scratch disease and mycobacterial infection. generalized lymphadenopathy is often caused by a viral infection, and less frequently by malignancies, collagen  vascular diseases, and medications. laboratory tests are not necessary in most children with cervical lymphadenopathy. most cases of cervical lymphadenitis are  self-limited and require no treatment. the treatment of acute bacterial cervical  lymphadenitis without a known primary source should provide adequate coverage for both staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes.

TI  == innate immune-induced depletion of bone marrow neutrophils aggravates systemic bacterial infections.
AB  == neutrophils are the most abundant leukocytes in circulation and provide a primary innate immune defense function against bacterial pathogens before development of  a specific immune response. these specialized phagocytes are short lived (12-24 hours) and continuously replenished from bone marrow. we found that if the host is overwhelmed by a high inoculum of listeria monocytogenes, neutrophils are depleted despite high granulocyte-colony stimulating factor induction. in contrast to a low-dose innocuous l. monocytogenes infection, high-dose listeria challenge blocks neutrophil recruitment to infectious abscesses and bacterial proliferation is not controlled, resulting in lethal outcomes. administering synthetic tlr2-ligand or heat-killed bacteria during the innocuous l. monocytogenes infection reproduced these effects, once again leading to overwhelming bacterial propagation. the same stimuli also severely aggravated salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pyogenes systemic infection. these data implicate systemic innate immune stimulation as a  mechanism of bone marrow neutrophil exhaustion which negatively influences the outcome of bacterial infections.

TI  == improved photodynamic inactivation of gram-positive bacteria using hematoporphyrin encapsulated in liposomes and micelles.
AB  == background and objectives: antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (pdi) is a promising treatment modality for local infections. to increase the efficacy of photosensitizer, hematoporphyrin (hp) was used as a model drug and encapsulated in liposomes and micelles. the bactericidal efficacy of the carrier-entrapped hp  was assessed against gram-positive bacteria. study design/materials and methods:  hp was encapsulated in liposomes by a modified reversed-phase evaporation and extrusion method. micelle-hp was prepared by the reversed-phase evaporation method. spectroscopic analysis was used to characterize the properties of hp in pbs, liposome or micelle. the pdi efficacy was examined by using gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-susceptible, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes. results: the absorption and fluorescence emission spectra indicated that hp encapsulated in liposomes and micelles is less likely to exist in aggregated form compared to that generally seen in an aqueous medium. liposome- or micelle-hp can induce complete eradication of the bacteria above a critical hp dose, which is significantly lower than the dose required when using the non-encapsulated hp. furthermore, the pdi effect of the hp encapsulated in micelles was superior to the hp encapsulated in liposomes at lower hp doses. similar pdi results were also found in s. epidermidis and s. pyogenes. conclusions: our results indicate that photosensitizer entrapped in micelle exert similar or better pdi efficacy than that of liposome, which indicates this formulation may be useful for the treatment of local infections in the future.

AB  == background: ecthyma is an invasive, ulcerated skin infection. four ecthyma outbreaks occurred in different infantry units in the israeli defense force from  october 2004 through february 2005. morbidity attack rates in the first 3 outbreaks were 89% (49 of 55 soldiers), 73% (32 of 44), and 82% (37 of 45). in the fourth outbreak, in which early intervention (antimicrobial treatment and improvement of hygiene) was applied, the attack rate was 25% (10 of 40 soldiers). in the first outbreak cluster, 4 soldiers experienced poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, and 5 cases of systemic sequelae were recorded (1 case of severe septic shock, 3 cases of pneumonia, and 1 case of septic olecranon bursitis). methods: streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus were isolated from ecthyma sores, oropharynx, and anterior nares of affected and unaffected soldiers involved in all 4 outbreaks. results: although the s. aureus  isolates had different genomic profiles, >90% of s. pyogenes isolates were identified as belonging to a single clone, emm type 81, t type 8. epidemiological investigation revealed that the hygiene levels of the soldiers and their living conditions were probably the most important cause for the difference in attack rates, wound severity, and systemic sequelae found between and within the units.  conclusions: our study demonstrates the possible ramifications of the combination of a virulent and highly infective s. pyogenes strain and poor living conditions, and it emphasizes the importance of early intervention in such conditions.

AB  == background: the standard treatment for septic arthritis in children is antimicrobials for several weeks (initially administered intravenously) and arthrotomy (at least for the hip and shoulder joints). no sufficiently powered study has examined the true need for these treatments. methods: in a randomized,  multicenter prospective trial in finland, children aged 3 months to 15 years who  had culture-positive septic arthritis were randomized to receive clindamycin or a first-generation cephalosporin for 10 days or 30 days (intravenously for the first 2-4 days). the number of surgical procedures was kept to a minimum. illness was monitored with preset criteria. antimicrobial therapy was discontinued when the clinical response was good and the c-reactive protein level decreased to 20 mg/l. the primary end point was full recovery without need for further administration of antimicrobial therapy because of an osteoarticular indication during the 12 months after therapy. results: of the total 130 cases, 88% were caused by staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, or streptococcus pyogenes; 63 patients were in the short-term treatment group, and 67 were in the  long-term treatment group. the median durations of antimicrobial treatment were 10 days and 30 days, respectively. surgical procedures that were more extensive than percutaneous joint aspiration were performed for 12% of patients, with no preponderance to hip or shoulder arthritis. two late-onset infections occurred in 1 child in the long-term treatment group; however, all patients recovered without sequelae. conclusions: large doses of well-absorbed antimicrobials for <2 weeks (initially administered intravenously) and only 1 joint aspiration are sufficient for treatment of most cases of childhood septic arthritis, regardless of the infecting pathogen or anatomical site, if the clinical response is good and the c-reactive protein level normalizes shortly after initiation of treatment.

AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to characterize the antimicrobial profile of rep3123, a novel inhibitor of methionyl-trna synthetase (metrs) in development for the treatment of clostridium difficile infection. methods: the spectrum of activity of rep3123 was determined by susceptibility testing of c. difficile and  non-target organisms. the mode of action was studied by enzyme inhibition assays, macromolecular synthesis assays, target overexpression and selection of spontaneous resistant mutants. results: rep3123 was active against a collection of 108 clinical isolates of c. difficile and against epidemic, moxifloxacin-resistant bi/nap1/027 strains (mic range=0.5-1 mg/l and mic(90) = 1  mg/l). the spectrum of activity included clinically important aerobic gram-positive cocci such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium (mic(90)s < 1 mg/l), but rep3123 was not active against most gram-negative bacteria. rep3123 targeted c. difficile metrs with a calculated inhibition constant (k(i)) of 0.020 nm, and selectivity was >1000-fold over human mitochondrial and cytoplasmic metrs. the specific mode  of action within bacterial cells was demonstrated by macromolecular synthesis assays that showed inhibition of protein synthesis by rep3123, and by mets overexpression, which resulted in a 16-fold increase in mic for rep3123. spontaneous rep3123-resistant mutants of c. difficile (mics, 4-128 mg/l) arose with frequencies of 10(-8)-10(-9) and harboured distinct point mutations within the mets gene, resulting in 13 different amino acid substitutions. most of the metrs substitutions caused reduced catalytic efficiency and a growth fitness burden. conclusions: rep3123 demonstrated a favourable microbiological profile and was found to target c. difficile with high specificity and selectivity.

AB  == staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes colonize mucosal surfaces of the human body to cause disease. a group of virulence factors known as superantigens  are produced by both of these organisms that allows them to cause serious diseases from the vaginal (staphylococci) or oral mucosa (streptococci) of the body. superantigens interact with t cells and apcs to cause massive cytokine release to mediate the symptoms collectively known as toxic shock syndrome. in this study we demonstrate that another group of virulence factors, cytolysins, aid in the penetration of superantigens across vaginal mucosa as a representative nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelial surface. the staphylococcal cytolysin alpha-toxin and the streptococcal cytolysin streptolysin o enhanced penetration of toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin  a, respectively, across porcine vaginal mucosa in an ex vivo model of superantigen penetration. upon histological examination, both cytolysins caused damage to the uppermost layers of the vaginal tissue. in vitro evidence using immortalized human vaginal epithelial cells demonstrated that although both superantigens were proinflammatory, only the staphylococcal cytolysin alpha-toxin induced a strong immune response from the cells. streptolysin o damaged and killed the cells quickly, allowing only a small release of il-1beta. two separate models of superantigen penetration are proposed: staphylococcal alpha-toxin induces a strong proinflammatory response from epithelial cells to disrupt the mucosa enough to allow for enhanced penetration of toxic shock syndrome toxin-1,  whereas streptolysin o directly damages the mucosa to allow for penetration of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin a and possibly viable streptococci.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of some thiourea derivatives and their nickel and copper complexes.
AB  == five thiourea derivative ligands and their ni(2+) and cu(2+) complexes have been  synthesized. the compounds were screened for their in vitro anti-bacterial activity using gram-positive bacteria (two different standard strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus) and gram-negative bacteria (esherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, proteus vulgaris, enterobacter aerogenes) and in vitro anti-yeast activity (candida albicans, candida krusei, candida glabrata, candida tropicalis, candida parapsilosis). the  minimum inhibitory concentration was determined for all ligands and their complexes. in vitro anti-yeast activity of both ligands and their metal complexes is greater than their in vitro anti-bacterial activity. the effect of the structure of the investigated compounds on the antimicrobial activity is discussed.

TI  == microbial aetiology of acute clinical mastitis and agent-specific risk factors.
AB  == a nation wide study on the microbial aetiology of cases of acute clinical mastitis in swedish dairy cows was conducted with the aim to investigate changes  in the microbial panorama compared to a previous study performed 1994-1995. another aim was to investigate some agent-specific environmental and individual risk factors. milk samples were collected from 987 udder quarter cases from 829 cows during six 2-month periods from may 2002 to april 2003, and data on risk factors and demography were collected at sampling by means of a questionnaire. in total, 1056 bacteriological diagnoses were made. the most frequently isolated bacterial species was staphylococcus aureus constituting 21.3% of the diagnoses,  followed by escherichia coli (15.9%), streptococcus dysgalactiae (15.6%), streptococcus uberis (11.1%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (6.2%), arcanobacterium pyogenes (6.1%) and klebsiella spp. (4.2%). samples with no growth or contamination constituted 10.6% and 4.5% of the diagnoses, respectively. a major shift in the panorama of udder pathogens was not observed compared to the survey in 1994-1995. isolation of klebsiella spp. was strongly associated with the use of sawdust as bedding material. on the other hand, using  sawdust as bedding reduced the risk of isolating s. uberis relative to using straw or peat. the risk of isolating e. coli increased with increasing milk yield and was higher in loose housing systems than in tie stalls. isolation of s. aureus was associated with tie stalls, and a. pyogenes with low yielding cows and teat lesions. s. dysgalactiae infections were also associated with teat lesions.

TI  == [multiple peritonsillar abscesses caused by arcanobacterium haemolyticum in a young female].
AB  == history: a 20-year-old previously healthy woman presented with a four-week history of sore throat and inability to swallow. investigation and diagnosis: initial examination revealed tender swelling and exudation of both palatine tonsils, trismus and bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. laboratory tests showed  leukocytosis, elevated c-reactive protein, but unremarkable epstein-barr virus titers. course and treatment: the patient was unsuccessfully treated for three days with topical antiseptics and systemic cefuroxime. cervical magnetic resonance tomography (mrt) disclosed multiple peritonsillar abscesses. for this reason a bilateral tonsillectomy was performed. aerobic cultures of the surgical  specimens revealed the exclusive presence of arcanobacterium haemolyticum. the patient's condition improved rapidly after surgery, with continued administration of cefuroxim. conclusions: peritonsillar abscesses are potentially life-threatening complications of a pharyngitis or tonsillitis. regularly, a mixed microbial flora including staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes and anaerobic bacteria such as fusobacterium can be isolated from abscess material. because of the virulence of the involved microorganisms and the proximity of the jugular vein and the carotid sheath, lemierre syndrome may develop (throat infection followed by anaerobic septicaemia). arcanobacterium haemolyticum is responsible for fewer than one percent of all pharyngotonsillitis cases. the infection is clinically indistinguishable from s. pyogenes or epstein-barr virus infections. any removed specimen should be cultured on media supporting growth of fastidious bacteria and under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. because of its inconspicuous colony morphology, arcanobacterium may be wrongly identified as physiological microflora and it is therefore probably underreported as a cause of pharyngotonsillitis and associated complications.

TI  == a fatty acid messenger is responsible for inducing dispersion in microbial biofilms.
AB  == it is well established that in nature, bacteria are found primarily as residents  of surface-associated communities called biofilms. these structures form in a sequential process initiated by attachment of cells to a surface, followed by the formation of matrix-enmeshed microcolonies, and culminating in dispersion of the  bacteria from the mature biofilm. in the present study, we have demonstrated that, during growth, pseudomonas aeruginosa produces an organic compound we have  identified as cis-2-decenoic acid, which is capable of inducing the dispersion of established biofilms and of inhibiting biofilm development. when added exogenously to p. aeruginosa pao1 biofilms at a native concentration of 2.5 nm, cis-2-decenoic acid was shown to induce the dispersion of biofilm microcolonies.  this molecule was also shown to induce dispersion of biofilms, formed by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and the yeast candida albicans. active at nanomolar concentrations, cis-2-decenoic acid appears to be functionally and structurally related to the class of short-chain fatty acid signaling molecules such as diffusible signal factor, which act as cell-to-cell communication molecules in bacteria and fungi.

TI  == a study on nosocomial pathogens in icu with special reference to multiresistant acinetobacter baumannii harbouring multiple plasmids.
AB  == background & objectives: antibiotic resistant bacterial nosocomial infections are a leading problem in intensive care units (icu). present investigation was undertaken to know antibiotic resistance in acinetobacter baumannii and some other pathogens obtained from clinical samples from icu causing nosocomial infections. special emphasis was given on plasmid mediated transferable antibiotic resistance in acinetobacter. methods: the clinical specimens obtained  from icu, were investigated to study distribution of nosocomial pathogens (272) and their antibiotic resistance profile. acinetobacter isolates were identified by api2one system. antimicrobial resistance was studied with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) by double dilution agar plate method. the plasmid profile of  26 antibiotic resistant isolates of acinetobacter was studied. curing of r-plasmids was determined in three antibiotic resistant plasmid containing a. baumannii isolates. plasmid transfer was studied by transformation. results: major infections found in icu were due to acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. the infection rate was maximum in urinary tract (44.4%) followed by wound infections (29.4%), pneumonia (10.7%) and bronchitis (7.4%). acinetobacter isolates displayed high level of antibiotic resistance (up to 1024microg/ml) to most of antibiotics. more than 90 per cent isolates of acinetobacter were resistant to a minimum of 23 antibiotics. plasmid profile of acinetobacter isolates showed presence of 1-4 plasmids. ethidium bromide cured plasmids pupi280, pupi281, pupi282 with curing efficiencies 20, 16 and 11 per cent respectively while acridine orange cured plasmids pupi280, pupi281 with curing efficiencies 7 and 18 per cent retrospectively. transformation frequency of e. coli hb101 with pupi281 was 4.3 x 10(4) transformants/microg plasmid dna. interpretation & conclusions: a. baumannii was found to be associated with urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections, septicaemia, bacteraemia, meningitis and wound infections. a. baumannii displayed higher resistance to more number of antibiotics than other nosocomial pathogens from icu. antibiotic sensitivity of a. baumannii cured isolates confirmed plasmid borne nature of antibiotic resistance markers. transfer of antibiotic resistant plasmids from acinetobacter to other nosocomial pathogens can create complications in the treatment of the patient. therefore, it is very important to target acinetobacter which is associated with nosocomial infections.

TI  == [managing children skin and soft tissue infections].
AB  == the skin infections are common in pediatrics, ranging from furonculosis or impetigo to the severe forms of necrotizing dermohypodermitis. the general antibiotic treatments are not always indicated but when they are, they must take  into account the resistance of two main species of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes), the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamic parameters and the severity and type of infection. two situations should be treated by topical treatements: limited impetigo and furonculosis. the two topical antibiotics used preferentially are mupirocine and fucidic acid. soon, a  third topical antibiotic, reptamuline will complete these. for uncomplicated superficial skin infections justifying an oral antibiotic, amoxicillin-clavulanate offers the best guarantee of efficiency. poor pharmacodynamic-pharmacokinetic must lead to not prescribe oral m penicillins. in case of allergy, a first-generation cephalosporin, a macrolide (if the susceptibility of the strain was checked) or pristinamycine (after 6 years of age) are acceptable alternatives. for dermohypodermitis bacterial antibiotic of choice remains amoxicillin-clavulanate through iv route, to be active against s.  pyogenes but also s. aureus and anaerobic bacteria. the iv route is maintained until regression general signs and a relay orally by the same drug is then possible. for toxinic syndromes and necrozing fascitis clindamycin should be added to a beta-lactam because of its action on protein synthesis in particular reducing the toxins production.

TI  == [the practice guideline 'bacterial skin infections' (first revision) from the dutch college of general practitioners; a response from the perspective of dermatology].
AB  == we reviewed the first revision of the clinical practice guidelines on the management of bacterial skin infections developed by the dutch college of general practitioners. bacterial skin infections are subdivided into superficial and deep infections; the former are often treated locally while the latter may require systemic antibiotics or surgical intervention. the rate of infection with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) in the community is relatively low in the netherlands, but the guideline provides recommendations, such as the restricted use of mupirocin ointment, to facilitate future mrsa control measures. clinical distinction between erysipelas and cellulitis is often impossible; therefore, the term cellulitis is used throughout the guideline and refers to both staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes infections of the skin and  subcutaneous tissue. the first line of therapy for cellulitis remains a small spectrum, beta-lactamase resistant penicillin, such as flucloxacillin for 10 days. there are no conclusive studies on the prevention of recurrent cellulitis,  so recommendations are based on expert opinion and pathophysiological considerations. the lack of rigorous and controlled studies often precludes making clear evidence-based recommendations. however, this guideline succeeds remarkably well in combining the available evidence and formulating sound practical management advice for bacterial skin infections in primary care in the  netherlands. it deserves widespread implementation among general practitioners.

TI  == quantum dots as enhancers of the efficacy of bacterial lethal photosensitization.
AB  == because of the increasing resistance of bacteria to antibiotics there is considerable interest in light-activated antimicrobial agents (laaas) as alternatives to antibiotics for treating localized infections. the purpose of this study was to determine whether cdse/zns quantum dots (qd) could enhance the  antibacterial activity of the laaa, toluidine blue o (tbo). suspensions of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes were exposed to white light (3600 lux) and tbo (absorbance maximum = 630 nm) in the presence and absence of 25 nm diameter qd (emission maximum = 627 nm). when the tbo:qd ratio was 2667:1,  killing of staph. aureus was enhanced by 1.72log(10) units. in the case of strep. pyogenes, an enhanced kill of 1.55log(10) units was achieved using tbo and qd in  the ratio 267:1. singlet oxygen and fluorescence measurements showed that qd suppress the formation of singlet oxygen from tbo and that qd fluorescence is significantly quenched in the presence of tbo (70-90%). enhanced killing appears  to be attributable to a non-forster resonance energy transfer mechanism, whereby  the qd converts part of the incident light to the absorption maximum for tbo; hence more light energy is harvested, resulting in increased concentrations of bactericidal radicals. qd may, therefore, be useful in improving the efficacy of  antimicrobial photodynamic therapy.

TI  == the bacterial superantigen and superantigen-like proteins.
AB  == summary: the bacterial superantigens are protein toxins that bind to major histocompatibility complex class ii and t-cell receptor to stimulate large numbers of t cells. the majority are produced by the gram-positive organisms staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes and are the causative agents in  toxic shock syndrome, an acute disease caused by the sudden and massive release of t-cell cytokines into the blood stream. the structure and function of the superantigens has revealed a common architecture that is also shared by another group of staphylococcal virulence factors called the superantigen-like proteins (ssl). together, this family of structurally related molecules highlights how a common pathogenic organism has employed a simple but adaptable protein to generate an armamentarium of potent defense molecules designed to target of the innate and adaptive immune response.

TI  == beta-defensin antibiotic peptides in the innate immunity of the buffalo: in vivo  and in vitro studies.
AB  == beta-defensin antimicrobial peptides are multifunctional biomolecules, which are  a major component of the oxygen-independent microbicidal system of buffalo polymorphonuclear (pmn) cells. they have great potential for use as proteomic biomarkers of host cell responses in the presence of microbial agents. on purifying these peptides by rp-hplc, four defensin peptides were revealed. the results from testing against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, candida albicans, rinderpest virus (rpv) and newcastle disease virus (ndv), showed that the peptides possessed antimicrobial and antiviral activities. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values varied according to the peptide amounts and the exposure time. furthermore, an increase  in the levels of these cationic antimicrobial peptides was apparent in milk obtained from natural cases of mastitis, as compared to the levels in normal milk. maldi-tof-based amino acid sequencing confirmed the expression of two beta-defensins (lap and bnbd-2) in mastitis milk. a comparison of peptide sequences revealed that buffalo lap and bnbd-2 share 98.6% and 100% sequence identity, respectively, with those of cattle. in vitro, bovine viral diarrhoea virus (bvdv) infection was shown to induce the expression of the beta-defensin gene, as evidenced by the pcr amplification of cdna with specific primers. the determination of the enhanced expression of beta-defensin peptides in mastitis milk and in pmn cells, can be considered as an advanced approach to the assessment of cellular and molecular responses to cell injury. it is hoped that in vitro studies on phagocytes such as pmn cells and other cell lines, will eventually replace the use of animals in elucidating the roles of these cytokines in response to microbe-derived cell damage. it will also be possible to use defensins as biomarkers to correlate failure in host cell defence systems with peptide heterogeneity.

TI  == [soft-tissue infections].
AB  == one of the soft-tissue infections with a large clinical relevance is necrotizing  fascitis produced by streptococcus pyogenes and skin infections produced by staphylococcus aureus, particularly due to the evermore frequent methylcillin (mrsa) resistant varieties. in necrotizing fascitis the diagnostic delay as well  as the delay in the indication for surgical debridement influence both the prognosis and a high mortality related to these infections. two clinical forms have been described: type i caused by at least one anaerobic species in combination with facultative anaerobes, more frequent in diabetics or patients with peripheral vascular disease; type ii, monomicrobial, produced by group a beta hemolytic streptococcus and with a lesser frequency by staphylococcus aureus. among the recognized risk factors diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular  disease, chronic renal failure, alcoholism, cancer, malnutrition, steroid and/or  immunosuppressant treatment and the use of intravenous parenteral drugs are widely recognized. therapeutics is based on hemodynamic support, antibiotic therapy and an early surgical approach with the elimination of all of the necrotic and devitalized tissue. infections frequently associated to community-acquired mrsa are those present in skin and soft-tissue. some population groups have been described as at-risk, but there is also an increase in the number of patients with no risk factors. also, national and international  registries of anti-tnf therapies have demonstrated the increase of soft-tissue infections in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with these agents. other biologic drugs such as rituximab, abatacept or anakinra do not seem to be associated to an increase in these infections.

TI  == the role of adenoids in pediatric rhinosinusitis.
AB  == objective: to evaluate adenoids' importance in pediatric rhinosinusitis as a cause of mechanical blockage or as a reservoir for pathogenic bacteria. methods:  a retrospective chart review of prospectively collected data was performed, which included 410 children under the age of 14 who underwent adenoidectomy in the study. adenoid bacteriology was evaluated with adenoid tissue culture, and sinusitis grade and adenoid size were determined using preoperative pns x-ray. a  potential correlation between these factors was then analyzed. results: the overall adenoid bacteria isolation rate was 79.3%. the most common bacteria were  haemophilus influenza (28.5%), streptococcus pneumonia (21.7%), streptococcus pyogenes (21.0%), and staphylococcus aureus (15.6%), and bacterial isolation rate increased significantly according to sinusitis grade (p=0.000). this was especially true of haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumonia, whose isolation rates increased significantly (p=0.011, p=0.001 each). there was no statistically significant difference in sinusitis grade or bacterial isolation rate according to adenoid size. conclusions: based on these results, adenoids contain many potentially pathogenic bacteria. we suggest that in pediatric rhinosinusitis, adenoids act as a reservoir for pathogenic bacteria rather than as a barrier causing mechanical obstruction.

TI  == biofilms in skin infections: propionibacterium acnes and acne vulgaris.
AB  == it is generally accepted that many human infections are biofilm-related and that  sessile (biofilm-grown) cells are highly resistant against antimicrobial agents.  propionibacterium acnes plays a role in the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris, a common disorder of the pilosebaceous follicles and it has been suggested that p.  acnes cells residing within the follicles grow as a biofilm. although p. acnes biofilms have not been observed directly in the pilosebaceous unit, the observation that p. acnes readily forms biofilm in vitro as well as on various medical devices in vivo, combined with the high resistance of sessile p. acnes cells and the increased production of particular virulence factors and qourum sensing molecules in sessile cells point in this direction. in addition, in vitro and in vivo biofilm formation has also been demonstrated for other microorganisms involved in skin diseases (including staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes).

AB  == acute neck swellings in a paediatric setting are often treated with antibiotics,  proceeding to incision and drainage if an abscess is suspected. a variety of investigations are available and the causative organism can vary. a five-year retrospective study analysing trends in microbiology, antibiotic sensitivity, clinical evaluation and management of children presenting with an acute cervical  abscess of four weeks duration or less was performed. the case notes of 175 children admitted between january 1996 and december 2000 to the acute surgical admission unit at the royal hospital of sick children, glasgow were studied. during this period there were 90 males and 85 females with a mean age of three years (range: one month to 13 years). one hundred and twenty three (70%) children underwent surgery with pus being confirmed in 114 (93%) of cases. ultrasound was  performed in 70 (40%) patients with 48 proceeding to surgery. positive culture of pus from abscess cavities revealed staphylococcus aureus in 46% (85% sensitive to both flucloxacillin and erythromycin) and streptococcus pyogenes in 15% (80% sensitive to penicillin and 75% to erythromycin). the role of investigations and  the available treatment options are discussed.

TI  == in vitro activity of daptomycin against gram-positive cocci: the first multicentre study in greece.
AB  == a total of 10420 gram-positive cocci (including staphylococci, enterococci and various groups of streptococci) collected from clinically significant specimens in ten greek hospitals during 2006--2007 were tested for their susceptibility to  daptomycin. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined by the broth microdilution method. daptomycin demonstrated very high activity against enterococcus faecalis (mic at which 50% of the isolates were inhibited (mic50) =  1mg/l and mic at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (mic90) = 1.36 mg/l), enterococcus faecium (mic50 = 1.36 mg/l and mic90 = 1.90 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (mic50 = 0.12 mg/l and mic90 = 0.50mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (mic50 = 0.09 mg/l and mic90 = 0.12 mg/l), streptococcus pneumoniae (mic50 = 0.24 mg/l and mic90 = 0.5 mg/l) and viridans group streptococci (mic50 = 0.50 mg/l and mic90 = 0.89 mg/l). resistance to linezolid and vancomycin for enterococci and to penicillin for streptococci appears to be independent of reduced susceptibility to daptomycin. on the other hand, daptomycin was also active against meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mic50 = 0.44 mg/l and mic90 = 0.78 mg/l) and meticillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic50 = 0.24 mg/l and mic90 = 0.44 mg/l); however, 0.9% of the staphylococci tested had an mic > 1mg/l, which is the clinical and laboratory standards institute breakpoint proposed for susceptibility. for all tested organism groups, resistance to daptomycin was not associated with glycopeptide resistance.

AB  == retapamulin, the first pleuromutilin antimicrobial agent approved for the topical treatment of skin infections in humans, was tested against 987 clinical isolates  representing 30 species and/or resistance groups. mics were determined along with disk diffusion zone diameters using a 2-microg disk. population distribution and  mic versus disk zone diameter scattergrams were analyzed to determine microbiological mic cutoff values and inhibition zone correlates. minimum bactericidal concentrations were performed on a smaller subset of key species. the retapamulin mic(90) against 234 staphylococcus aureus isolates and 110 coagulase-negative staphylococci was 0.12 microg/ml. retapamulin mic(90)s ranged  from 0.03 to 0.06 microg/ml against beta-hemolytic streptococci including 102 streptococcus pyogenes, 103 streptococcus agalactiae, 59 group c streptococcus, and 71 group g streptococcus isolates. the mic(90) against 55 viridans group streptococci was 0.25 microg/ml. retapamulin had very little activity against 151 gram-negative bacilli and most of the enterococcus species tested. based on the data from this study, for staphylococci, mics of <or=0.5, 1, and >or=2 microg/ml  with corresponding disk diffusion values of >or=20 mm, 17 to 19 mm, and <or=16 mm can be proposed for susceptible, intermediate, and resistant microbiological cutoffs, respectively. for beta-hemolytic streptococci, a susceptible-only mic of <or=0.25 microg/ml with a corresponding disk diffusion value of >or=15 mm can be  proposed for susceptible-only microbiological cutoffs.

TI  == crystal structures of fibronectin-binding sites from staphylococcus aureus fnbpa  in complex with fibronectin domains.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus can adhere to and invade endothelial cells by binding to the human protein fibronectin (fn). fnbpa and fnbpb, cell wall-attached proteins  from s. aureus, have multiple, intrinsically disordered, high-affinity binding repeats (fnbrs) for fn. here, 30 years after the first report of s. aureus/fn interactions, we present four crystal structures that together comprise the structures of two complete fnbrs, each in complex with four of the n-terminal modules of fn. each approximately 40-residue fnbr forms antiparallel strands along the triple-stranded beta-sheets of four sequential f1 modules ((2-5)f1) with each fnbr/(2-5)f1 interface burying a total surface area of approximately 4,300 a(2). the structures reveal the roles of residues conserved between s. aureus and streptococcus pyogenes fnbrs and show that there are few linker residues between fnbrs. the ability to form large intermolecular interfaces with  relatively few residues has been proposed to be a feature of disordered proteins, and s. aureus/fn interactions provide an unusual illustration of this efficiency.

AB  == the japanese society of chemotherapy (jsc) conducted the first nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens during the period from january to august 2006. with the cooperation of 32 medical institutions throughout japan, a  total of 924 strains belonging to seven clinically relevant bacterial species were collected from adult patients with well-diagnosed respiratory tract infections (rtis). antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the 887 evaluable strains (205 staphylococcus aureus, 200 streptococcus pneumoniae, 9 streptococcus pyogenes, 165 haemophilus influenzae, 91 moraxella catarrhalis, 74 klebsiella pneumoniae, and 143 pseudomonas aeruginosa) to 42 antibacterial agents was conducted at the central laboratory of the research center for anti-infective drugs of the kitasato institute, according to recommendations issued by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi). the antibacterial agents employed were 25 beta-lactams, three aminoglycosides, four macrolides (including  one azalide and one ketolide), one lincosamide, one tetracycline, two glycopeptides, five fluoroquinolones, and one oxazolidinone. the incidence of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) was 63.4%, and the incidences of penicillin-intermediately resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp) and penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) were 35.0% and 4.0%, respectively. among h. influenzae, 21.2% of the strains were found to be beta-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin (abpc)-intermediately resistant (blnai), 29.1% to be beta-lactamase-nonproducing  abpc-resistant (blnar), and 4.8% to be beta-lactamaseproducing abpc-resistant (blpar) strains. the incidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing k. pneumoniae was 2.7% (2 of 74 strains). three (2.1%) of the 143 p. aeruginosa strains were found to be metallo-beta-lactamaseproducing, including 1 (0.7%) multidrug-resistant strain. through the nationwide surveillance, we obtained fundamental antimicrobial susceptibility data of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens in adult rti to various antibacterial agents. these data will be a useful reference for future periodic surveillance studies, as well as for investigations to control antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.

TI  == differentiation of streptococcus pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak isolates by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus [pnc]) is a causative agent of many infectious diseases, including pneumonia, septicemia, otitis media, and conjunctivitis. there have been documented conjunctivitis outbreaks in which nontypeable (nt), nonencapsulated pnc has been identified as the etiological agent. the use of mass spectrometry to comparatively and differentially analyze protein and peptide profiles of whole-cell microorganisms remains somewhat uncharted. in this report, we discuss a comparative proteomic analysis between nt s. pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak strains (cpnc) and other known typeable or  nt pneumococcal and streptococcal isolates (including pnc tigr4 and r6, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes) and nonstreptococcal isolates (including escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus) as controls. cpnc cells and controls were grown to mid-log phase, harvested, and subsequently treated with a 10% trifluoroacetic acid-sinapinic acid matrix mixture. protein and peptide fragments of the whole-cell bacterial isolate-matrix combinations ranging in size from 2 to 14 kda were evaluated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. additionally random forest analytical tools and dendrogramic representations (genesis) suggested similarities and clustered the isolates into distinct clonal groups, respectively. also, a peak list of protein and peptide masses was obtained and compared to a known pnc protein mass library, in which a peptide common and unique to cpnc isolates was tentatively identified. information gained from this  study will lead to the identification and validation of proteins that are commonly and exclusively expressed in cpnc strains which could potentially be used as a biomarker in the rapid diagnosis of pneumococcal conjunctivitis.

TI  == determination of antibacterial activity of polyenzyme preparations gumseb using in vitro methods.
AB  == a novel polyenzyme formulation gumseb developed by advanced enzyme technologies ltd, thane and speciality biochemicals co., usa, was tested for antibacterial properties using atcc strains and clinical isolates of salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. a modified antibiotic susceptibility test  was used for the purpose. s. aureus, s. pyogenes and s. pneumoniae were found to  be sensitive to the formulation at the chosen concentration. next, to study the interaction between gumseb and currently used antibiotic, a checkerboard minimum  inhibitory concentrations (mic) was carried out for each organism. the assay was  carried out with the aim of establishing whether the polyenzyme formulation had any potentiating effect on the antibiotic of choice. synergistic effect was established when gumseb was used in conjunction with penicillin against s. pyogenes. partial synergy was established when it was used in conduction with ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa and with ciprofloxacin against methicillin sensitive, coagulase positive s. aureus. antagonism was established when it was used in conjunction with ampicillin against e. coli, with ciprofloxacin against s. typhi and coagulase negative staphylococcal strain. the results indicate that  gumseb can be used in conjunction with those antibiotics with which a synergistic or a partially synergistic effect could be shown, as in the case of p. aerugionosa and s. aureus. these findings have particular importance since these  organisms are responsible for hospital based infections and are notorious for antibiotic resistance. in cases where antagonism was established, it should not be used in combination with that particular antibiotic. however, it can be used individually since it has proved to have antibacterial activity and mic could be  determined for all five commonly encountered pathogens. therefore, it has the potential of being a novel broad range antibacterial drug. these findings are significant given the alarming rise in incidence of antibiotic resistance in most clinically important pathogens.

TI  == antibacterial properties of synovial fluid in the knee.
AB  == this study evaluated antimicrobial properties of synovial fluid against 3 gram-positive organisms: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus epidermidis. synovial fluid was collected from the knees of 52 patients. three gram-positive bacteria culture lines were incubated in wells containing either synovial fluid and broth, or broth alone. fluid was plated and  incubated, and colonies were counted after 1, 4, and 24 hours to determine bacterial growth. statistically significant differences in bacterial counts were  found between control and experimental groups at 0, 4, and 24 hours for all 3 bacterial species. bacterial counts in the control specimens demonstrated exponential growth over 24 hours as would be expected in the absence of growth inhibition. in contrast, bacterial counts in all of the synovial fluid specimens  decreased steadily over 24 hours. these results demonstrate synovial fluid possesses potent bactericidal activity against the most common gram-positive pathogens responsible for septic arthritis. delineating these antimicrobial properties further may offer avenues to augment the body's protection against bacterial infections.

TI  == lambdasa2 prophage endolysin requires cpl-7-binding domains and amidase-5 domain  for antimicrobial lysis of streptococci.
AB  == streptococcal pathogens contribute to a wide variety of human and livestock diseases. the routine use of antibiotics to battle these pathogens has produced a new class of multidrug-resistant streptococci. thus, there is a need for new antimicrobials. bacteriophage endolysins (peptidoglycan hydrolases) comprise one  group of new antimicrobials that are reportedly refractory to resistance development. the lambdasa2 prophage endolysin gene was recently isolated from a group b streptococcal genome, expressed on an escherichia coli plasmid, and shown by homology screening and biochemical analysis to harbor an amidase-5 (endopeptidase) domain, an amidase-4 (glycosidase) domain, and two cpl-7 cell wall-binding domains. in this study, turbidity reduction and plate lysis assays indicate that this hydrolase shows strong lytic activity toward streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus equi, ges, and ggs. deletion analysis indicates that the n-terminal endopeptidase domain with both cpl-7 domains can lyse with a higher specific activity than the  full-length protein (against some strains). this dual cpl-7 domain truncated version also shows weak lytic activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and the coagulase negative staphylococci, staphylococcus xylosus. the truncated constructs harboring the glycosidase domain are virtually inactive, showing only minimal activity on plate lysis assays.

TI  == mast cells determine the magnitude of bacterial toxin-induced skin inflammation.
AB  == mast cells are known to be important effector cells in innate immune responses to bacterial infections. however, up to now, neither the mechanisms nor the relevance of mast cell degranulation in innate skin immune responses to bacteria  have been adequately addressed. in this article, we show that the bacterial toxins streptolysin o (slo) and alpha-toxin potently induce degranulation of mast cells in vitro and in vivo. furthermore, intradermal injection of the toxins results in pronounced skin inflammation, which either resolves quickly within a few h (slo-induced inflammation) or presents a chronic process with ongoing inflammation for weeks (alpha-toxin). interestingly, mast cells mediated the inflammatory effects of slo, but in contrast limited inflammatory skin responses  to alpha-toxin. these findings further support the hypothesis that mast cells are critically involved in initiating and modulating optimal host responses to bacteria by either inflammatory or anti-inflammatory effects, depending on the course of the host reaction induced by the pathogen.

TI  == [colonization (infection) of the respiratory tract in outpatients in 2000-2005 years].
AB  == infections of the respiratory tract are one of the main causes of family doctor visiting. a variety of etiological factors (mostly viruses, typical and non typical bacteria) causes that the diagnosis of these infections is rarely made in outpatient practice (usually these are nose and throat smears); additionally the  carrier state of typical bacteria in the respiratory tract impedes the interpretation of microbiological results. the aim of the study was to assess the incidence of potential bacterial etiological factors of respiratory tract infections in outpatients in the years 2000-2005. material and methods: the 3270  microbiological results obtained from patients at the age of between 1 month and  88 years old with chronic and acute symptoms of respiratory tract infections were analyzed. results: the positive results of bacteria culture indicating the possible bacterial etiological agent of infection were found from 1051 patients (34.4%), mostly in autumn - spring time. most often were isolated: h. influenzae  - 28.8%, s. pneumoniae - 22.1% and s. aureus - 22.1%, in less percentage m. catarrhalis - 14.1% and s. pyogenes - 13.1. positive bacteria cultures were received most often from ear secretion- 66.8% (p. aeruginosa, s. aureus), from nose-41.2% (s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae), sputum - 34.9% (s. aureus), throat - 24.3% (h. influenzae, s. pyogenes). conclusions: it has been confirmed that predominant participation of viruses in respiratory system infections is observed and also seasonal character of their bacterial nature occurrence (35%). most often were isolated: h. influenzae, s. pneumoniae, s. aureus, also m. catarrhalis. on the ground of carrier state of these bacteria in nasopharynx it is a clinician's decision to recognize the bacteria as the etiological agent of infection and possible use of antibiotic treatment.

AB  == the current surveillance establishes the activity profile of tigecycline against  recent clinical u.s. isolates of target pathogens. findings from a distributed surveillance that utilized etest yielded a tigecycline activity profile that varied from that observed in a separate centralized broth microdilution (bmd) surveillance (d. c. draghi et al., poster d-0701, 46th intersci. conf. antimicrob. agents chemother., san francisco, ca). differences were noted among acinetobacter spp. and serratia marcescens and, to a lesser extent, with streptococcus pyogenes. to address whether these differences were due to discordance in testing methodology or to variations among the analyzed populations, isolates from the current surveillance were concurrently tested by bmd and etest. in all, 1,800 staphylococcus aureus, 259 s. pyogenes, 226 streptococcus pneumoniae, 93 enterococcus faecalis, 1,356 enterobacteriaceae, and 227 acinetobacter baumannii strains were evaluated. tigecycline had potent activity by bmd, with >99.6% susceptibility (%s) observed for all pathogens with  interpretive criteria, excluding enterobacter cloacae (98.3% s) and e. faecalis (86.0% s), and mic(90)s ranged from 0.03 mug/ml (s. pyogenes/s. pneumoniae) to 1  mug/ml (enterobacteriaceae/a. baumannii). similar profiles were observed by etest, with the exception of a. baumannii, although for most evaluated pathogens  etest mics trended one doubling-dilution higher than bmd mics. major or very major errors were infrequent, and a high degree of essential agreement was observed, excluding a. baumannii, s. marcescens, and s. pneumoniae, for which >/=4-fold differences in mics were observed for 29, 27.1, and 34% of the isolates, respectively. further analysis regarding the suitability of the tigecycline etest for testing s. marcescens, acinetobacter spp., and s. pneumoniae is warranted.

TI  == [the assessment of bacterial flora and antibiotic-sensitivity of bacteria isolated from conjunctival sac, skin of the eyelids and inflammatory lesions in patients with acne vulgaris and rosacea].
AB  == aim: to evaluate bacterial flora of conjunctival sac, the skin of the eyelids and inflammatory lesions in patients with acne vulgaris, rosacea and of healthy people. bacterial colonization of conjunctival sac, the skin of the eyelids and skin lesions is more frequent in patients with acne vulgaris and rosacea. because antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria are quite often met, it seems important  to determine antibiotic-sensitivity of isolated bacteria. material and methods: 178 people underwent bacteriological examination of conjunctival sac, skin of the eyelids and skin lesions: 64 patients with acne vulgaris, 59 patients with rosacea and 55 healthy persons. microorganisms were identified with laboratory techniques with the use of bio-merieux kits and determination of drug-sensitivity was performed with recognized laboratory techniques. results: positive cultures and general frequencies of the isolations were found to be higher in both groups  in comparison with the reference group (the group of clinically healthy people).  in healthy persons practically the only saprophytic bacteria--the most often s. epidermidis and s. viridans--were isolated. whereas in patients suffering from acne vulgaris and rosacea the pathogenic bacteria--s. aureus, p. fluorescens, p.  acnes, p. aeruginosa--were additionally isolated. different spectrum of sensitivity to antibiotics of bacteria isolated from conjunctival sac, the skin of the eyelids and skin lesions in the cases of acne vulgaris and rosacea was proved. conclusions: 1. in the cases of acne vulgaris the majority of isolated bacteria from conjunctival sac included streptococcus spp., staphylococcus spp. and enterobacteriaceae. 2. in the severe cases of rosacea the main bacteria found in conjunctival sac were s. aureus, s.pyogenes, p.aeruginosa, e. faecalis, a. baumanii, p. fluorescens. 3. because of changeable drug-sensitivity of bacterial  strains, it seems to be necessary to perform individual culture and antibiogram in every patient with inflammatory lesions, in particular in clinically severe and resistant to therapy cases of acne vulgaris and rosacea. 4. the higher frequency of the bacterial colonisations in the conjunctival sac in patients with acne vulgaris and rosacea can be a potential source of ocular infections in the cases of local and systemic disorders of protective mechanisms. 5. estimation of  bacterial flora and antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from conjunctival sac, the skin of the eyelids and skin lesions should be perform, especially when  patients are prepared for eye surgery.

TI  == lethal photosensitization of wound-associated microbes using indocyanine green and near-infrared light.
AB  == background: the increase in resistance to antibiotics among disease-causing bacteria necessitates the development of alternative antimicrobial approaches such as the use of light-activated antimicrobial agents (laaas). light of an appropriate wavelength activates the laaa to produce cytotoxic species which can  then cause bacterial cell death via loss of membrane integrity, lipid peroxidation, the inactivation of essential enzymes, and/or exertion of mutagenic effects due to dna modification. in this study, the effect of the laaa indocyanine green excited with high or low intensity light (808 nm) from a near-infrared laser (nir) on the viability of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and pseudomonas aeruginosa was investigated. results: all  species were susceptible to killing by the laaa, the bactericidal effect being dependent on both the concentration of indocyanine green and the light dose. indocyanine green photosensitization using both high (1.37 w cm(-2)) and low (0.048 w cm(-2)) intensity nir laser light was able to achieve reductions of 5.6  log10 (>99.99%) and 6.8 log10 (>99.99%) in the viable counts of staph. aureus and strep. pyogenes (using starting concentrations of 106-107 cfu ml(-1)). kills of 99.99% were obtained for p. aeruginosa (initial concentration 108-109 cfu ml(-1)) photosensitized by the high intensity light (1.37 w cm(-2)); while a kill of 80%  was achieved using low intensity irradiation (0.07 w cm(-2)). the effects of l-tryptophan (a singlet oxygen scavenger) and deuterium oxide (as an enhancer of  the life span of singlet oxygen) on the survival of staph. aureus was also studied. l-tryptophan reduced the proportion of staph. aureus killed; whereas deuterium oxide increased the proportion killed suggesting that singlet oxygen was involved in the killing of the bacteria. conclusion: these findings imply that indocyanine green in combination with light from a near-infrared laser may be an effective means of eradicating bacteria from wounds and burns.

TI  == changing trends in acute osteomyelitis in children: impact of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == background: staphylococcus aureus remains the most common etiologic agent of acute osteomyelitis in children. recently, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) has emerged as a major pathogen. methods: records of all children admitted with acute osteomyelitis from january 1999 to december 2003 were reviewed. for the comparative analysis, the study population was evenly distributed in 2 periods: period a, january 1999 to june 2001; n = 113; and period b, july 2001 to december 2003; n = 177. in addition, clinical findings of mrsa osteomyelitis were compared with non-mrsa osteomyelitis, including methicillin-sensitive s. aureus infections. results: two hundred ninety children (60% male subjects) with acute osteomyelitis were identified. median (25th-75th percentile) age at diagnosis was 6 years (range, 2-11 years). significant clinical findings included the following: localized pain (84%), fever (67%), and swelling (62%). affected bones  included the following: foot (23%), femur (20%), tibia (16%), and pelvis (7%). thirty-seven percent of blood cultures were positive, and a bacterial isolate was obtained in 55% of cases. bacteria most frequently isolated included the following: methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (45%) (57% in period avs 40% in period b), mrsa (23%) (6% in a vs 31% in b; p < 0.001), streptococcus pyogenes (6%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (5%). children with mrsa compared with those with non-mrsa osteomyelitis had significantly greater erythrocyte sedimentation rate and c-reactive protein values on admission and increased length of hospital stay, antibiotic therapy, and overall rate of complications. we observed significant changes in antibiotic therapy related to increased use of agents with activity against mrsa. conclusions: methicillin-resistant s. aureus was isolated more frequently in the second study period and was associated with worse clinical outcomes.

TI  == streptococcus sp. and staphylococcus aureus isolates from patients with psoriasis possess genes that code for toxins (superantigens): clinical and therapeutic implications.
AB  == superantigens are powerful t lymphocyte-stimulating agents that are believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of certain diseases such as psoriasis. toxins produced by streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus are superantigens. the aim of this study was to detect genes that code for superantigens in streptococcus and staphylococcus aureus isolates from psoriatic patients. primers to amplify streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin a, b, and c and streptolysin o genes  and staphylococcal enterotoxin a, b, c, and d genes were used. streptococcal exotoxin b was detected in five streptococcal isolates. staphyloccocus aureus enterotoxin a and/or c genes were detected in nine s. aureus isolates. isolates from 13 of 22 patients possesed gene(s) that code for toxin(s) (superantigens). these results might support the role of superantigens in the exacerbation of psoriasis.

TI  == in vitro investigation of the antibacterial effect of ketamine.
AB  == background: antibacterial activity of local anesthetics especially lidocaine has  been shown previously. in this study, the antibacterial effect of ketamine, a general anesthetic agent was investigated. methods: the antibacterial effect of ketamine was studied using six different strains of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, entecoccus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes,  pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli) with disc diffusion method. ciprofloxacine discs (cip, oxoid) were used as a control to verify the methodology. minimal inhibition concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) of ketamine for these bacteria were also determined. results: no inhibition was evident in discs containing 62.5 microg of ketamine. ketamine 125 microg showed activity on all the bacteria tested with the exception of e. coli. the inhibition rates of ketamine were more prominent at the doses of 250 microg and 500 microg similar to the inhibition rate of cip. whereas mic and mbc  values of ketamine for s. aureus and s. pyogenes were 500 microg ml(-1), mic and  mbc values for p. aeruginosa were above 2000 microg ml(-1). for other bacteria, these values ranged between these levels. conclusions: ketamine with higher doses showed antibacterial activity. we thought that it will be proper to use ketamine  hesitantly in experimental animal studies like sepsis and translocation.

TI  == a quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  == objectives: toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. this can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. in this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. methods: fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. microorganisms were enumerated and identified. bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated pbs solution  for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. results: counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) cfu. candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. no obligate anaerobes were isolated. members of streptococcaceae family were regularly found  (65.2%) belonging to the following species: streptococcus pyogenes, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. sobrinus, s. viridans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, aerococcus viridans. a. viridans and s. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were found on adults  brushes. escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp. and enterococcus sp., were also recovered. we found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. however, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. conclusions: ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.

AB  == group a beta-haemolytic streptococcus is a well-known cause of necrotising fasciitis, which is increasing in incidence and severity. more aggressive soft tissue infections of the hand and upper extremity caused by this organism have been noted in our plastic surgical unit, prompting a five-year retrospective study to find out which factors affect clinical outcomes. the records of 31 patients, 27 male and 4 female, with group a beta-haemolytic streptococcal soft tissue infections with a mean (sd) age of 25 (12) years were reviewed. twenty-seven infections followed injuries, while four were spontaneous. six patients required more than two operations to clear the infection, and one required free tissue transfer for closure of the resulting soft tissue deficit. of the variables age, number of cigarettes consumed daily, interval from the date of injury to the date of presentation, coexisting infection with staphylococcus aureus, and grade of infection at presentation, only the last correlated with the patients' clinical course (p<0.001). those patients with spontaneous infections with pre-existing medical conditions had a worse prognosis, requiring more operations and a longer stay in hospital. a multicentre prospective study would be useful to confirm these findings.

TI  == the human cxc chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (gcp-2)/cxcl6 possesses membrane-disrupting properties and is antibacterial.
AB  == granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (gcp-2)/cxcl6 is a cxc chemokine expressed by macrophages and epithelial and mesenchymal cells during inflammation. through binding and activation of its receptors (cxcr1 and cxcr2), it exerts neutrophil-activating and angiogenic activities. here we show that gcp-2/cxcl6 itself is antibacterial. antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria of relevance to mucosal infections was seen at  submicromolar concentrations (minimal bactericidal concentration at which 50% of  strains tested were killed, 0.063 +/- 0.01 to 0.37 +/- 0.03 mum). in killed bacteria, gcp-2/cxcl6 associated with bacterial surfaces, which showed membrane disruption and leakage. a structural prediction indicated the presence of three antiparallel nh(2)-terminal beta-sheets and a short amphipathic cooh-terminal alpha-helix; the latter feature is typical of antimicrobial peptides. however, when the synthetic derivatives corresponding to the nh(2)-terminal (50 amino acids) and cooh-terminal (19 amino acids, corresponding to the putative alpha-helix) regions were compared, higher antibacterial activity was observed for the nh(2)-terminus-derived peptide, indicating that the holopeptide is necessary for full antibacterial activity. an artificial model of bacterial membranes confirmed these findings. the helical content of gcp-2/cxcl6 in the presence or absence of lipopolysaccharide or negatively charged membranes was studied by circular dichroism. as with many antibacterial peptides, membrane disruption by gcp-2/cxcl6 was dose-dependently reduced in the presence of nacl, which, we here demonstrate, inhibited the binding of the peptide to the bacterial surface. compared with cxc chemokines ena-78/cxcl5 and nap-2/cxcl7, gcp-2/cxcl6 showed a 90-fold-higher antibacterial activity. taken together, gcp/cxcl6, in addition to its chemotactic and angiogenic properties, is likely to contribute to direct antibacterial activity during localized infection.

TI  == functional fe3o4/tio2 core/shell magnetic nanoparticles as photokilling agents for pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == a photokilling approach for pathogenic bacteria is demonstrated using a new type  of magnetic nanoprobe as the photokilling agent. in addition to their magnetic property, the nanoprobes have other features including a photocatalytic property  and the capacity to target bacteria. the nanoprobes comprise iron oxide/titania (fe(3)o(4)@tio(2)) core/shell magnetic nanoparticles. as dopamine molecules can self-assemble onto the surface of the titania substrate, dopamine is used as the  linker to immobilize succinic anhydride onto the surfaces of the fe(3)o(4)@tio(2) nanoparticles. this is followed by the immobilization of igg via amide bonding. we demonstrate that the igg-fe(3)o(4)@tio(2) magnetic nanoparticles not only have the capacity to target several pathogenic bacteria, but they also can effectively inhibit the cell growth of the bacteria targeted by the nanoparticles under irradiation of a low-power uv lamp within a short period. staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, and antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains, such as multiantibiotic-resistant s. pyogenes and methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), are used to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach.

AB  == the present trial was conducted in hungary in neighboring large indoor and outdoor pig production units, belonging to the same breeding company. rejected kidneys from 201 (out of 241; 83.4%) outdoor, and 191 (out of 512, 37.3%) indoor  high parity sows, with previous history of recidiving postparturient fever and excessive postparturient vulvovaginal discharge were gross pathologically bacteriologically, and histologically evaluated. all rejected kidneys revealed chronic pyelonephritis. in outdoor sows escherichia (e.) coli and actinobaculum (a.) suis were cultured from all kidneys. besides e. coli and a. suis, clostridium spp., arcanobacterium pyogenes, gram-positive streptococci (enterococci, streptococcus faecalis), staphylococci (staphylococcus (s.) albus,  s. epidermis, s. aureus), erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, and klebsiella spp. were  concurrently found in 131 (64.7%) kidneys; pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter, pasteurella multocida, proteus spp. were concurrently found beside e. coli and a. suis in 71 (35.3%) kidneys. in indoor sows e. coli and a. suis were cultured from all kidneys as well. pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter, pasteurella multocida,  proteus spp. were found beside e. coli and a. suis in 21 (11%) kidneys. however only 6 sows (3.1%) revealed the concurrent presence of clostridium spp., arcanobacterium pyogenes, gram-positive streptococci (enterococci, streptococcus  faecalis), staphylococci (s. albus, s. epidermis, s. aureus), erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, and klebsiella spp. implications: in eastern european climate, more high parity outdoor sows with recidiving postparturient fever and vulvovaginal discharge have pyelonephritis and higher diversity of pathogenic bacteria in the renal pelvis compared with indoor sows.

TI  == associated antimicrobial resistance in escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == associated resistance to four to six related and unrelated antimicrobial agents was investigated in consecutive non-duplicate isolates of escherichia coli (n = 39 425), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1070), staphylococcus aureus (n = 7489), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1604) and streptococcus pyogenes (n = 2531). in all species, high proportions (76.5-88.9%) of isolates were susceptible to all the drugs investigated. irrespective of species, isolates resistant to one drug were  more likely to be resistant to any of the other drugs than were susceptible isolates. thus, trimethoprim resistance in e. coli was 38.4% among ampicillin-resistant vs. 3.9% among ampicillin-susceptible isolates, and erythromycin resistance in strep. pneumoniae was 41% among doxycycline-resistant  vs. 1% among doxycycline-susceptible isolates. in all five species investigated,  there was also significant associated resistance among unrelated drugs, highlighting the fact that resistance development occurs primarily among bacteria already resistant to one or more antimicrobial agents. for the clinician, pronounced resistance associations mean that when empirical therapy fails because of resistance, there is a reduced chance of choosing an alternative successful empirical agent. for the epidemiologist, who uses routine clinical susceptibility data to describe resistance development, resistance associations mean that if the dataset contains results for isolates selected on the basis of their susceptibility to another drug, structurally related or not, a bias of false resistance is introduced.

TI  == [kawasaki disease and infection].
AB  == kawasaki disease (kd) is an acute multisystemic vasculitis. although some infectious agents are highly suspected the etiology of kd remains unknown. various bacteria such as, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and yersinia pseudotuberculosis have been implicated in etiology of kd. however, modern molecular techniques failed to identify the positive relation between these agents and etiology of kd. recently, one hypothesis suggests that superantigens (tss-1, seb, sec, speb, spec), which are produced by streptococci and staphylococci, play an important role in the cause of kd. although several studies show that superantigens, mainly bacterial toxins and viral antigens, are  involved in causing some diseases, there is no obvious evidence that superantigens are able to induce kd. host-derived factor as well as infectious agents should be investigated to understand the immunopathogenesis of kd.

TI  == characterization of a bacteriophage lysin (ply700) from streptococcus uberis.
AB  == the antibacterial properties of bacteriophage lytic enzymes may be of importance  in future mastitis control programs. a prophage was isolated from a strain of streptococcus uberis (atcc 700407) following exposure to mitomycin c. partial sequencing of the phage dna revealed a putative lysin based on sequence similarity to other streptococcal phage lysins. the putative lysin (ply700) was recombinantly expressed in escherichia coli, and chromatographically purified. addition of the purified ply700 to bacterial suspensions of s. uberis, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus dysgalactiae caused a rapid, calcium-dependent lysis while there was little activity against streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, or e. coli. killing of s. uberis in milk by ply700 (50 microg/ml) was confirmed by plate count assay. activity was related to the initial concentration of bacteria in that 31% killing (p<0.05) was observed with an inoculating dose of approximately 4500 cfu/ml, while 81% killing (p<0.01) was observed when the inoculum was reduced to approximately 600 cfu/ml. in contrast, complete sterilization was observed in parallel cultures suspended in assay buffer indicating that factors in milk are able to neutralize the lysin. functional characterization of the c-terminal domain, as a component of a gfp fusion protein, revealed its calcium-dependent ability to bind to s. uberis. the  c-terminal domain may have utility in targeting s. uberis while it remains to be  determined if the lysin by itself has sufficient potency in milk for effective use in the control of s. uberis mastitis.

TI  == epidemiology of streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis in tropical communities, northern australia.
AB  == streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (groups c and g streptococci [gcs/ggs]) is an increasingly recognized human pathogen, although it may follow indirect pathways. prospective surveillance of selected households in 3 remote aboriginal communities in australia provided 337 gcs/ggs isolates that were emm sequence-typed. lancefield group c isolates (gcs) were localized to specific households and group g isolates (ggs) were more evenly distributed. gcs/ggs was more frequently recovered from the throat than group a streptococci (gas [s. pyogenes]) but rarely recovered from skin sores, and then only with staphylococcus aureus or gas. symptomatic ggs/ggc pharyngitis was also rare. specific emm sequence types of gcs/ggs did not appear to cycle through the communities (sequential strain replacement) in a manner suggesting acquisition of type-specific immunity. these communities already have high levels of streptococcal and poststreptococcal disease. gcs/ggs may increase in importance as it acquires key virulence factors from gas by lateral gene transfer.

TI  == phagocytosis-independent antimicrobial activity of mast cells by means of extracellular trap formation.
AB  == these days it has been increasingly recognized that mast cells (mcs) are critical components of host defense against pathogens. in this study, we have provided the first evidence that mcs can kill bacteria by entrapping them in extracellular structures similar to the extracellular traps described for neutrophils (nets). we took advantage of the ability of mcs to kill the human pathogen streptococcus  pyogenes by a phagocytosis-independent mechanism in order to characterize the extracellular antimicrobial activity of mcs. close contact of bacteria and mcs was required for full antimicrobial activity. immunofluorescence and electron microscopy revealed that s pyogenes was entrapped by extracellular structures produced by mcs (mcets), which are composed of dna, histones, tryptase, and the antimicrobial peptide ll-37. disruption of mcets significantly reduced the antimicrobial effect of mcs, suggesting that intact extracellular webs are critical for effective inhibition of bacterial growth. similar to nets, production of mcets was mediated by a reactive oxygen species (ros)-dependent cell death mechanism accompanied by disruption of the nuclear envelope, which can be induced after stimulation of mcs with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (pma), h(2)o(2), or bacterial pathogens. our study provides the first experimental evidence of antimicrobial extracellular traps formation by an immune cell population other than neutrophils.

TI  == screening of the enterocin genes and antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria in enterococcus strains obtained from different origins.
AB  == antimicrobial activities of 139 enterococcus isolates (48 e. faecium and 91 e. faecalis) obtained from canine feces, boiler meat samples, swine feces, wild waterfowl feces, and human feces were examined against respective bacteria, including streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enteritidis, and escherichia coli. bacteriocin (bac) production assay revealed that the antimicrobial activity against at least  one of 6 indicator strains (bac+ phenotype) was found in 51 (37%) isolates (29 e. faecium and 22 e. faecalis). twenty-four of 46 isolates positive for at least one of the enterocin structural genes (enta, entb, entl50ab, and cyll) showed a bac+  phenotype. the existence of other enterocins or nonenterocin factors was implied  because the bac+ phenotype was detected in a total of 27 enterococcus isolates that had none of the enterocin genes tested. the antimicrobial activity against gram-negative strains (salmonella enteritidis and e. coli) was detected in the 6  enterococcus isolates that had either the enta, entb, entl50ab or cyll genes. moreover, the proportion of the antimicrobial activity against l. monocytogenes among the cyll-positive e. faecalis isolates showing beta-hemolysis (10/16) was significantly (p<0.01) higher than among those lacking beta-hemolysis (2/15). the results suggested that certain characteristics are likely to be associated with the antimicrobial activity against specific organisms.

TI  == the antibacterial activity of peptides derived from human beta-2 glycoprotein i is inhibited by protein h and m1 protein from streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == during the last years, the importance of antibacterial peptides has attracted considerable attention. we report here that peptides derived from the fifth domain of beta-2 glycoprotein i (beta(2)gpi), a human heparin binding plasma protein, have antibacterial activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. streptococcus pyogenes, an important human pathogen that can survive and grow in human blood, has developed mechanisms to escape the attack by these peptides. thus, protein h and m1 protein, two surface proteins of the highly pathogenic s. pyogenes ap1 strain, bind full-length beta(2)gpi and thereby prevent the processing of beta(2)gpi by proteases from polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmns) into antibacterial peptides. in addition, protein h and m1 protein, released from the bacterial cell wall by pmn-derived proteases, bind to, and inhibit the activity of, beta(2)gpi-derived antibacterial peptides. taken together, the data suggest that the interaction between the streptococcal proteins and beta(2)gpi or beta(2)gpi-derived peptides presents a novel mechanism to resist an antibacterial attack by beta(2)gpi-cleavage products.

TI  == evaluating the role of hla-dq polymorphisms on immune response to bacterial superantigens using transgenic mice.
AB  == bacterial superantigens bind directly to human leukocyte antigen (hla) class ii molecules and vigorously activate t cells expressing certain t-cell receptor variable region families. as interaction with hla class ii molecules is the primary step in this process, polymorphic variations in hla class ii can determine the extent of superantigen binding to hla class ii molecules, govern the magnitude of immune activation induced by given superantigens and determine the outcome of superantigen-mediated diseases. as direct assessment of the influence of hla class ii polymorphism in humans is impossible because of expression of more than one hla class ii alleles in a given individual and toxicity of superantigens, transgenic mice expressing hla-dq6 (hla-dqa1*0103 and  hla-dqb1*0601) and hla-dq8 (hla-dqa1*0301 and hla-dqb1*0302) were used to achieve this goal. hla-dq6 and hla-dq8 elicited comparable in vitro and in vivo immune response to staphylococcal enterotoxins (se) a, seb, seh and sek, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin (spe) a and spec and streptococcal mitogenic exotoxin z (smez). however, each superantigen had a unique t-cell receptor activation profile. in vivo challenge with streptococcus pyogenes, h305, capable of elaborating spea and smez, yielded a similar clinical  outcome in hla-dq6 and hla-dq8 transgenic mice. in conclusion, hla-dq6 and hla-dq8 elicited comparable response to certain bacterial superantigens. our report highlights the advantages of hla class ii transgenic mice in such studies.

AB  == the case of mr m, a previously healthy 39-year-old man with erythema and swelling of his finger, illustrates the issues involved in treating community-acquired skin and soft tissue infections since the emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) in the community. most community-acquired infections of the skin and soft tissues are caused by s aureus or streptococcus pyogenes. until recently, infections due to such organisms in the united states could safely be treated with an oral antistaphylococcal penicillin or an oral first-generation cephalosporin. however, the emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococci as community-acquired pathogens has changed the picture as far as empirical therapy is concerned. not only do community-acquired mrsa bacteria cause furunculitis and cellulitis, they have also been involved in a variety of more serious and life-threatening infections. most of these organisms are susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, minocycline, doxycycline, and rifampin, and these agents, along with clindamycin, have been used in the therapy of such infections, even though no clinical trials have proven their efficacy. for more serious, life-threatening infections, linezolid or parenteral agents such as vancomycin or daptomycin should be considered.

AB  == the aim of this study is to carry out an analysis of the fixture-abutment interfaces (fai), comparing different connection systems, to evaluate the role of geometric discrepancy, which is present between the abutment and the fixture, in  favoring the permeability to bacterial colonization. two types of commercially available fai were studied, 16 screwed fai (sweden-martina italia) (4 of o 3.8 mm diameter, 4 of o 4.7 mm diameter, 4 of o 5.7 mm diameter and 4 of o 6.7 mm diameter) and 4 fai (bicon) (o 3.5mm diameter). the assays were carried out in vitro, placing the different dental implants in contact with broth culture of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pyogenes to test the infiltration inside the fai. furthermore, scanning electron  microscope (sem) analysis was carried out to evaluate the gap at the fixture-abutment interface. in all the locking taper fai and in the screwed fai with a diameter of 3.8 mm there was no trace of bacterial infiltration of the species examined. in the screwed fai with a diameter of 4.7 mm, 5.7 mm and 6.7 mm there was an increasing level of bacterial infiltration in relationship to the diameter. therefore, this paper shows that there exists an important correlation  between the diameter of the screwed implant and the permeability to microbic infiltration that is directly proportional to the diameter of the implant.

AB  == this paper reviews a meeting at which basic pathophysiology of infections, mechanisms of action of hyperimmune products and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters, as well as currently available hyperimmunes and their potential new targets and uses, were discussed. a hyperimmune product was defined as either a monoclonal antibody or a polyclonal preparation enriched with antibody directed against one or more particular targets. a number of issues were emphasised, including: resistant bacterial pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes; the role of hyperimmune intravenous globulins  in the prevention of sepsis in low birthweight infants; hepatitis b virus infection associated with liver transplantation; combination therapy; the potential role of hyperimmunes in the prevention and treatment of hepatitis c virus; and the use of immunoglobulins for the prophylaxis of epstein-barr virus-related lymphoproliferative disease. routes of administration were also discussed. it was concluded that the development of hyperimmunes faces numerous obstacles. it was agreed that the use of hyperimmunes in clinical trials must be  standardised; clinical trials must be large enough to have sufficient power to demonstrate efficacy with clear-cut end-points, and means need to be developed, in conjunction with regulatory agencies, for the feasible evaluation of combination products. however, progress in all these aspects will provide a wide  range of hyperimmunes for future use.

(2) to determine the number of visits and time spent in the emergency department (ed) for treatment. design: a descriptive  case-control study. setting: a tertiary care pediatric ed at an academic medical  center. methods: medical records of all otherwise healthy children (aged 1-16 yrs) presenting with noncomplicated, nonfacial cellulitis over a 3-year period (january 1, 2001-december 31, 2003) were reviewed. data extracted included the following: demographics; clinical presentation; laboratory and microbiology results; management, including choice, dose, and route of antibiotic(s); treatment failures; and time spent in the ed. interventions: none. main results:  two hundred sixty-nine patients met the inclusion criteria, and their charts were selected for review. the oral antibiotic most often prescribed was cephalexin (n  = 105). treatment failure occurred in 10 (8.9%) of the cases. the intravenous antibiotic most often prescribed was cefazolin (n = 124; 39 received cefazolin alone, and 85 received cefazolin and probenecid). the cefazolin-only group had 12 (31%) treatment failures, whereas the cefazolin and probenecid group had 7 (8.1%) treatment failures. more time in the ed (521 +/- 287 minutes) and more visits (3.4 +/- 2.8) were seen in the intravenous group as compared with the oral group  (time in ed, 164 +/- 139 minutes; visits, 1.4 +/- 1). conclusions: noncomplicated, nonfacial cellulitis is most commonly treated using first-generation cephalosporins. treatment with oral antibiotics was effective and required fewer visits and less time in the ed compared with intravenous treatment. twice-daily cefazolin and probenecid was associated with less treatment failures and admissions than cefazolin alone and may represent a reasonable alternative for children with nonfacial cellulitis requiring intravenous antibiotics.

AB  == background: the microbiology of acute otitis media has changed in the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pcv) era. we hypothesize similar changes with pediatric mastoiditis. objectives: to compare the etiology of mastoiditis in the  pre-pcv (january 1995-december 2000) and post-pcv (january 2001- april 2005) eras to guide empiric antimicrobial therapy in the pediatric emergency department. methods: retrospective chart review of all patients admitted with a diagnosis of  mastoiditis from january 1995 to april 2005. results: : one hundred twenty-two charts were reviewed, 68 pre-pcv and 54 post-pcv. etiological agents were determined by culture results in 60 patients. the most common bacterial isolates  were streptococcus pneumoniae (24), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12), staphylococcus aureus (12), streptococcus pyogenes (8), and haemophilus influenzae (2). there was no reduction in mastoiditis due to s. pneumoniae from the pre-pcv to the post-pcv eras (odds ratio [or], 0.9; 95% confidence interval [ci], 0.4-2.1; p = 0.77). ceftriaxone nonsusceptibility was seen in 30% of post-pcv s. pneumoniae isolates compared with 7% of pre-pcv isolates. acute mastoiditis was diagnosed in 93 patients, and chronic mastoiditis (defined as >or=3 wk of symptoms) was diagnosed in 29 patients. streptococcus pneumoniae was more likely to be implicated in acute versus chronic mastoiditis (or, 9.2; 95% ci, 1.2-52.2; p = 0.01). pseudomonas aeruginosa was more frequently implicated in chronic versus acute mastoiditis (or, 16.4; 95% ci, 2.1-75.8; p = 0.0003). conclusions: there was no difference in the proportion of pediatric mastoiditis cases caused by s. pneumoniae in the pre-pcv versus post-pcv eras. empiric antimicrobial therapy with ceftriaxone alone is not sufficient in the post-pcv era.

TI  == commercial peptidoglycan preparations are contaminated with superantigen-like activity that stimulates il-17 production.
AB  == the immunomodulatory properties of peptidoglycan (pgn), a constituent of the bacterial cell wall, have been studied extensively but with contrasting results.  recent studies have demonstrated that the tlr2-mediated inflammatory responses elicited by gram-positive pgn preparations are in fact a result of contaminating  lipoproteins and lipoteichoic acid that can be removed only through sophisticated extraction procedures. here, we report that commercial preparations of staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes pgn are contaminated with bacterial superantigens (sag). the t cell-derived cytokines il-17a and il-17f were induced by pgn preparations but not by tlr agonists or nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain-like receptor agonists in human pbmc. il-17 induction  by pgn preparations was sensitive to protease digestion and required tcr signaling. bacterial sag could be detected by immunoblot in the pgn preparations, and purified recombinant sag were powerful inducers of il-17. finally, the pgn preparations stimulated proliferation and expansion of t cells bearing specific tcr v beta elements. our results suggest that a large body of literature that relied on commercial pgn preparations to study inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis, where il-17 also plays an important role, should be interpreted with caution and possibly revisited. future studies aimed at characterizing the activities of pgn should use pgn preparations of proven purity.

TI  == cospray dried antibiotics for dry powder lung delivery.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the potential of delivering a combination antibiotic therapy, containing doxycycline and ciprofloxacin (both hydrochloride) as a dry powder (dpi) formulation for inhalation. single and combination antibiotics were produced by spray drying. particle size distributions were characterized by laser diffraction and imaging conducted by scanning electron microscopy. solid-state characterisation of the antibiotics was carried out using differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic vapour sorption, x-ray powder diffraction, and differential scanning calorimetry. using the aerolizer device, the aerosol performance was measured using multistage liquid impinger and analysed using high performance liquid chromatography (r(2) = 1.0, cv = 0.4-1.0%). furthermore, a disk diffusion test was performed for the assessment of the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the raw and spray dried antibiotics against bacteria. results showed that cospray drying of the ciprofloxacin and doxycycline produced an antibiotic formulation (in a 1:1 ratio) suitable for inhalation that showed to be physically more stable then the analogous single spray dried antibiotic. the cospray dried powder has improved dispersion over the less stable single spray dried ciprofloxacin. the spray dried antibiotics were observed to have similar antimicrobial activity to the original antibiotics for staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pyrogenes, suggesting the spray drying process does not affect the anti-bacterial activity of the drug. cospray dried antibiotics from a dpi is thus feasible and can potentially be an attractive delivery alternative to the more conventional systemic delivery route.

TI  == inherent antibacterial activity of a peptide-based beta-hairpin hydrogel.
AB  == among several important considerations for implantation of a biomaterial, a main  concern is the introduction of infection. we have designed a hydrogel scaffold from the self-assembling peptide, max1, for tissue regeneration applications whose surface exhibits inherent antibacterial activity. in experiments where max1 gels are challenged with bacterial solutions ranging in concentrations from 2 x 10(3) colony forming units (cfus)/dm2 to 2 x 10(9) cfus/dm2, gel surfaces exhibit broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. results show that the hydrogel surface is  active against gram-positive (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus,  and streptococcus pyogenes) and gram-negative (klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli) bacteria, all prevalent in hospital settings. live-dead assays  employing laser scanning confocal microscopy show that bacteria are killed when they engage the surface. in addition, the surface of max1 hydrogels was shown to  cause inner and outer membrane disruption in experiments that monitor the release of beta-galactosidase from the cytoplasm of lactose permease-deficient e. coli ml-35. these data suggest a mechanism of antibacterial action that involves membrane disruption that leads to cell death upon cellular contact with the gel surface. although the hydrogel surface exhibits bactericidal activity, co-culture experiments indicate hydrogel surfaces show selective toxicity to bacterial versus mammalian cells. additionally, gel surfaces are nonhemolytic toward human  erythrocytes, which maintain healthy morphologies when in contact with the surface. these material attributes make max1 gels attractive candidates for use in tissue regeneration, even in nonsterile environments.

TI  == [epidemiology and bacteriological diagnosis of paediatric acute osteoarticular infections].
AB  == acute paediatric osteo-articular infections require a fast and sensitive diagnosis allowing a treatment directed to the causative pathogen. many micro-organisms can be incriminated, but staphylococcus aureus and kingella kingae markedly prevail. k. kingae became the first bacterial species responsible for septic arthritis in children < 3 years. more rarely, (2)haemolytic streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae are found. the incidence of community acquired s. aureus resistant to oxacillin in osteo-articular infections is still  low in france. the microbiological diagnosis of septic arthritis relies upon analysis of articular fluid, which requires systematic inoculation of a blood culture vial to increase the recovery rate of k. kingae. if the culture is negative, it is recommended to carry out a universal pcr or a pcr targeted to the main germs responsible for septic arthritis. indeed, pcr represents an undeniable benefice for the diagnosis of paediatric septic arthritis, particularly for the dna detection of k. kingae. the diagnosis of acute osteomyelitis relies primarily upon blood cultures, since the bone puncture is not a systematic procedure in this setting. their efficiency is low, and there is still a need to look for other arguments of diagnosis such as search of possible portals of entry or specific serologies.

AB  == aims: this study compared in vitro activities of actichelated propolis (a multicomposite material obtained with mechano-chemichal activation) and of a hydroalcoholic extract of propolis. methods and results: minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc), determined by means of microdilution broth method, against five strains of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, enterococcus spp., escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, showed a greater  potency of actichelated propolis (mic range: 0.016-4 mg flavonoids ml(-1)) in respect to the hydroalcoholic extract (mic range: 0.08-21.4 mg flavonoids ml(-1)). concentrations of actichelated propolis active against adenovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus and herpes virus type 1 were at least 10 times lower than those of the hydroalcoholic extract. preincubation of strep. pyogenes and h. influenzae with subinhibitory concentrations of actichelated propolis (1/4 and 1/8 x mic) significantly reduced the number of bacteria that adhered to human buccal cells. conclusions: actichelated propolis has proven to possess antibacterial and antiviral activity higher than a hydroalcoholic extract, being also able to interfere on bacterial adhesion to human oral cells.  significance and impact of the study: this new formulation of propolis showing better antimicrobial and physical characteristics could improve the application of propolis in respiratory tract infections.

TI  == effects of av119, a natural sugar from avocado, on malassezia furfur invasiveness and on the expression of hbd-2 and cytokines in human keratinocytes.
AB  == av119 is a patented blend of two sugars from avocado that can induce human beta-defensin-2 production by normal human keratinocytes. in this study, we analysed the effect of av119 on growth and invasiveness of malassezia furfur, a dimorphic, lipid-dependent yeast that is part of the normal human cutaneous commensal flora. the ability to modulate the expression of the proinflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokines in normal human keratinocytes was also investigated. microbiological assay demonstrated that this sugar induced the aggregation of yeast cells and inhibited the invasiveness of m. furfur, without affecting its growth. real-time pcr analysis demonstrated that av119 was able to  modulate the hbd-2 response in treated keratinocytes, reaching a maximum after 48-h treatment, and to induce the recovery of a satisfactory proinflammatory response in human keratinocytes. as av119 can induce aggregation of yeast cells,  thus inhibiting their penetration into the keratinocytes, the sugar could be used in the preparation of cosmetics or pharmacological drugs to inhibit colonization  of the skin by pathogenic strains of m. furfur.

TI  == bacteriologic comparison of tonsil core in recurrent tonsillitis and tonsillar hypertrophy.
AB  == objectives: although many bacteriology studies on tonsillar diseases have been completed, all have been confined to children and were characterized by a paucity of cases. the purpose of this study was to analyze the underlying bacterial pathogens in tonsillar disease. methods: a retrospective study was performed on 824 patients who underwent elective tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy.  we analyzed the differences between the bacterial pathogens in recurrent tonsillitis and tonsillar hypertrophy with regard to age, season, and antibiotic  sensitivity. results: among 824 cases, 966 bacterial strains from the tonsil core were isolated. in recurrent tonsillitis, staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen (30.3%), followed by haemophilus influenzae (15.5%) and group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus (streptococcus pyogenes, 14.4%). in patients over 14 years of age, quite differently from other age groups, klebsiella pneumoniae was  isolated at a significantly higher percentage. in tonsillar hypertrophy, h. influenzae was isolated most commonly (31.4%) regardless of age, followed by s. pyogenes (24.2%), s. aureus (22.9%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (12.6%). furthermore, mixed infection was common because of its high resistance to penicillin. in both groups, s. pneumoniae was more common in younger patients, whereas k. pneumoniae was relatively common in adults. we found no differences in the detection rate by season; however, h. influenzae was frequently isolated in the tonsillar hypertrophy group regardless of seasonal variations. we also found  no difference in the antibiotic sensitivity between the two groups; however, strains resistant to penicillin were relatively prevalent and showed a high sensitivity to third-generation cephalosporin. conclusions: we observed some differences in the types of bacteria in the tonsillar core between the recurrent  tonsillitis and tonsillar hypertrophy groups. our study indicates that essential  bacteria have been changing and, thus, we need to change our choice of antibiotics.

TI  == a silkworm model of pathogenic bacterial infection.
AB  == silkworms are invertebrate animals that are killed by bacteria pathogenic against humans, such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio cholerae. injection into the hemolymph of antibiotics that are clinically used for human patients abolishes the killing effects. there are several advantages to using silkworms as an infection model, such as low cost, the absence of ethical problems that are associated with the use of mammals, and  a body size large enough to handle while injecting sample solution into the hemolymph. we screened s. aureus mutants with attenuated virulence against silkworms and found three novel virulence regulatory genes, cvfa, cvfb, and cvfc. these genes contribute to virulence against mice and are required for exotoxin production. the cvfa gene is required for expression of the agr locus, which regulates most exotoxin genes, and a novel dna binding protein sarz. silkworms are susceptible to s. aureus beta toxin, p. aeruginosa exotoxin a, and diphtheria toxin. therefore, silkworms are a promising infection model animal for the identification and evaluation of virulenceassociated genes.

AB  == the goal of the study was to derive initial costs associated with failure of initial mupirocin therapy among patients diagnosed with uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections (usssis). a retrospective observational analysis of medical, pharmacy, and enrollment records was conducted using data from the national managed care benchmark database. patients were classified as failing treatment with mupirocin if they either filled a second antibiotic commonly used  to treat usssis five to 30 days after their index mupirocin prescription fill or  experienced a usssi-related hospitalization within 30 days after the index mupirocin prescription fill. among 12,650 failure episodes, 11,867 (93.8%) required a second antibiotic contributing a mean cost of $62 per prescription. approximately 4,782 (37.8%) had an associated outpatient encounter resulting in a mean cost of $221 per encounter. nine percent of failures required a hospitalization with a mean cost of $6,597 per hospitalization. these medical, hospital, and pharmacy costs translated into an expected cost of $735.45 per mupirocin failure among patients with usssis. the management of usssis is costly  in terms of health care resource use and direct health care expenditures when initial therapy with mupirocin fails.

TI  == crystal structure of cefditoren complexed with streptococcus pneumoniae penicillin-binding protein 2x: structural basis for its high antimicrobial activity.
AB  == cefditoren is the active form of cefditoren pivoxil, an oral cephalosporin antibiotic used for the treatment of respiratory tract infections and otitis media caused by bacteria such as streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, and methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus. beta-lactam antibiotics, including cefditoren, target penicillin-binding proteins (pbps), which are membrane-associated enzymes that play essential roles in the peptidoglycan biosynthetic process. to envision the binding of cefditoren to pbps, we determined the crystal structure of a trypsin-digested form of pbp 2x from s. pneumoniae strain r6 complexed with cefditoren. there are two pbp 2x molecules (designated molecules 1 and 2) per asymmetric unit. the structure reveals that the orientation of trp374 in each molecule changes in a different way upon the formation of the complex, but each forms a hydrophobic pocket. the methylthiazole group of the c-3 side chain of cefditoren fits into this binding pocket, which consists of residues his394, trp374, and thr526 in molecule 1 and residues his394, asp375, and thr526 in molecule 2. the formation of the complex is also accompanied by an induced-fit conformational change of the enzyme in the  pocket to which the c-7 side chain of cefditoren binds. these features likely play a role in the high level of activity of cefditoren against s. pneumoniae.

TI  == qsar studies on benzoylaminobenzoic acid derivatives as inhibitors of beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase iii.
AB  == fatty acid biosynthesis is essential for most of the bacterial survival. components of this biosynthetic pathway have been identified as attractive targets for the development of new antibacterial agents. fabh, beta-ketoacyl-acp  synthase iii, is a attractive target since it is central to the initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis. quantitative structure-activity relationship (qsar) studies have been carried out on a series of benzoylaminobenzoic acid derivatives as potent inhibitors of fabh and antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis,  neisseria meningitidis and escherichia coli, which demonstrate fabh inhibitory activity in cell free and whole cell system. the qsar studies revealed that inhibitory activity increases with increase in hydrophobicity, molar refractivity, aromaticity, and presence of oh group (on x position of the nucleus). on the other side presence of hetero-atoms like n, o, or s at r(1) position of the nucleus decreases the inhibitory activity. the comparison of qsar between the fabh inhibitory activity and antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, e. faecalis, n. meningitidis also demonstrates that the hydrophobicity, aromaticity and presence of oh group (on x  position of the nucleus) are conducive for the inhibitory activity.

AB  == this study was undertaken to test the in vitro activity of tigecycline against 117 clinically relevant gram-positive pathogens and to correlate this activity with their resistance gene content. overall, tigecycline showed a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) range of 0.015-0.5mg/l, able to inhibit potently all multiresistant streptococci, enterococci and mr staphylococci. tigecycline was active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococci, with mics for 90% of the organisms (mic(90)) of 0.25 mg/l and 0.12 mg/l, respectively, being more active than linezolid (mic(90)=2 mg/l) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (mic(90)=0.5 and 2-4 mg/l, respectively). molecular characterisation of resistance determinants demonstrated the concomitant presence of different classes of genes: in particular, tet(m), erm(b) and erm(c) in streptococcus agalactiae; tet(o), variably associated with different erm genes, in streptococcus pyogenes; vana, tet(m) and erm(b) in enterococcus faecalis, and  vana and erm(b) in enterococcus faecium. all the mrsa strains harboured sccmec and erm genes and 50% possessed tet(k) with tet(m) genes. staphylococcus epidermidis strains were only resistant to erythromycin. these results clearly demonstrate that tigecycline has a mic(90) range of 0.015-0.5 mg/l both against tetracycline-susceptible and -resistant isolates carrying other resistance determinants, suggesting that this drug could play an important role in the treatment of infections caused by these multiresistant gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == antimicrobial compounds from eremophila serrulata.
AB  == we report a search for antimicrobial compounds in the australian plant eremophila serrulata. bioassay directed fractionation of a diethyl ether extract prepared from the leaves of e. serrulata led to the isolation of two compounds, an omicron-naphthoquinone, 9-methyl-3-(4-methyl-3-pentenyl)-2,3-dihydronaphtho[1,8-bc]pyran-7,8-dione (2), and a serrulatane diterpenoid, 20-acetoxy-8-hydroxyserrulat-14-en-19-oic acid (3). two other known serrulatane-type diterpenoids, 8,20-dihydroxyserrulat-14-en-19-oic acid (4) and 8,20-diacetoxyserrulat-14-en-19-oic acid (5) were also isolated. none of these compounds had previously been tested for antimicrobial activity. compounds 2-5 showed antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213) with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) ranging from 15.6 to 250mug/ml. compound 2 was the most active with an mic of 15.6mug/ml and a minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of 125mug/ml. this compound also showed antimicrobial activity against other gram-positive bacteria including streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae. no activity was observed for this compound against  all gram-negative bacteria tested.

TI  == evaluation of an internally controlled real-time polymerase chain reaction assay  targeting the groel gene for the detection of bartonella spp. dna in patients with suspected cat-scratch disease.
AB  == bartonella (b.) henselae is the causative agent of cat-scratch disease (csd), which usually presents as a self-limiting lymphadenopathy. this study reports the development and evaluation of an internally controlled real-time polymerase chain reaction targeting the groel gene for detection of bartonella spp. dna was extracted using the magna pure system. the lower detection limit was 10-100 fg dna and the in vitro sensitivity of the assay was not affected by duplexing with  an internal control pcr. the real-time pcr assay detected dna from all five b. henselae strains tested, and from b. birtlesii, b. vinsonii subsp. vinsonii, b. vinsonii subsp. arupensis and b. doshiae. the assay generated negative results with a selection of other bacteria, including several mycobacterium spp., streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus. results of real-time pcr in clinical samples were compared with those of a conventional 16s rdna-based pcr assay. during the period described in the material and methods section, real-time pcr and conventional 16s pcr were performed on 73 clinical samples. of these samples, 29 (40%) were found to give positive results and 44 (60%) gave negative  results, both by real-time pcr and by conventional pcr, with a 100% agreement between the two tests. the pcr developed in this study is a rapid, sensitive, and simple method for the detection of bartonella spp. in csd and is suitable for implementation in the diagnostic laboratory.

TI  == therapeutic applications of tigecycline in the management of complicated skin and skin structure infections.
AB  == complicated skin and skin structure infections encompass a diverse range of diseases frequently caused by gram-positive pathogens, and most commonly by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. treatment of these infections represents a growing clinical challenge as increases in multi-drug-resistant organisms and cross-resistance to antimicrobial therapy have made empiric therapeutic choices more difficult, particularly for patients with known risk factors or who are immunocompromised. complicating this issue has been the relative lack of new agents with antimicrobial potency against prevalent resistant species such as meticillin resistant s. aureus (mrsa). tigecycline, a novel glycylcycline, is a broad-spectrum antibiotic with potent microbiological activity against the wide variety of organisms implicated in the aetiology of complicated skin and skin structure infections. recent phase iii clinical data confirm previous observations on the safety and efficacy of tigecycline for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections. tigecycline was shown to be non-inferior to combination vancomycin-aztreonam regimens and exhibited high clinical success rates. mic(90) values for tigecycline were uniformly low for both susceptible and resistant pathogens. adverse events were similar in incidence for both patient populations, with nausea and vomiting reported more frequently with tigecycline treated patients while rash and elevated liver transaminases were most commonly observed in the vancomycin-aztreonam treatment group. tigecycline helps to address the urgent need for new antimicrobial agents to combat the emergence of multi-drug-resistant gram-positive pathogens. current clinical, microbiological and safety data support the use of tigecycline as a valuable therapeutic option in the treatment  of complicated skin and skin structure infections.

TI  == understanding how leading bacterial pathogens subvert innate immunity to reveal novel therapeutic targets.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus (sa) and group a streptococcus (gas) are prominent gram-positive bacterial pathogens, each associated with a variety of mucosal and  invasive human infections. sa and gas systemic disease reflects diverse abilities of these pathogens to resist clearance by the multifaceted defenses of the human  innate immune system. here we review how sa and gas avoid the bactericidal activities of cationic antimicrobial peptides, delay phagocyte recruitment, escape neutrophil extracellular traps, inhibit complement and antibody opsonization functions, impair phagocytotic uptake, resist oxidative burst killing, and promote phagocyte lysis or apoptosis. understanding the molecular basis of sa and gas innate immune resistance reveals novel therapeutic targets for treatment or prevention of invasive human infections. these future therapies  envision alternatives to direct microbial killing, such as blocking disease progression by neutralizing specific virulence factors or boosting key innate immune defenses.

AB  == background: to survey infectious diseases in intravenous drug users and to provide basic information on disease course in this subpopulation. material and methods: a retrospective study of all inpatient intravenous drug users, from 2002 to 2005. the obtained data were sorted according to the main diagnosis and final  results of chronic infections were achieved by outpatient follow-up. results: out of 436 cases of intravenous drug users in our group, 44 % (191/436) were patients admitted with acute viral hepatitis, 16 % (67/436) with soft-tissue or skin infections, 7 % (29/436) with respiratory infections, 4 % (18/436) with urogenital infections and 4 % (19/436) with sepsis. progression to chronic hepatitis b occurred in 3 % (4/125) of cases, fulminant course of acute hepatitis b was observed in 1.6 % (2/125) of cases. spontaneous clearance of hepatitis c virus was demonstrated in 46 % (11/24) of subjects. the most frequent pathogens responsible for bacterial infections in drug users were staphylococcus aureus (53 %, 27/51) and streptococcus pyogenes (22 %, 11/51). in the infectious endocarditis group, right heart valves were affected in 78 % (7/9), left heart valves in 11 % (1/9) and bilateral lesions were seen in 11 % (1/9) of cases. two  (22 %, 2/9) endocarditis patients died (one with tricuspid and the other with aortic valve involvement). patients with the main diagnosis other than hepatitis  were screened and 71 % of them were found positive for anti-hcv, 57 % for anti-hbc total and 32 % for anti-hav total. conclusions: during the analyzed period, no hiv-positive drug users were found. the findings are in striking contrast to data published abroad. treatment of drug users is often complicated by low compliance with the treatment and hospital regimens and/or by a frequent lack of follow-up treatment. despite this fact, no significant variations in the  course or results of infectious diseases in drug users were found in comparison to the general population.

TI  == chitosan malate inhibits growth and exotoxin production of toxic shock syndrome-inducing staphylococcus aureus strains and group a streptococci.
AB  == previously, it has been shown that the polysaccharide chitosan inhibits the growth of gram-positive bacteria. in this study, chitosan malate was evaluated in broth and thin-film cultures for its effect on the growth and exotoxin production of toxic shock syndrome (tss)-inducing staphylococcus aureus (five strains, three producing tss toxin 1 and one each producing enterotoxin b or c) and group a streptococci (three strains producing streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin a). also,  the compound was evaluated in a rabbit subcutaneous wiffle ball model for its ability to prevent s. aureus and group a streptococcal induction of tss. finally, chitosan malate was evaluated for its ability to prevent tss and necrotizing fasciitis in rabbits after subcutaneous inoculation with microbes. chitosan malate inhibited both bacterial growth and, at sub-growth-inhibitory concentrations, the production of exotoxins, in both broth and thin-film cultures. rabbits treated with chitosan malate in implanted wiffle balls were protected from prior challenge with tss-inducing s. aureus compared to animals not receiving chitosan malate (p < 0.001) and group a streptococci (p < 0.005). chitosan malate protected rabbits from the development of streptococcal tss with  necrotizing fasciitis (p < 0.01). the data suggest that use of this growth- and toxin-inhibitory compound may be able to reduce the severity of s. aureus and group a streptococcal mucous membrane and trauma-associated skin infections.

TI  == synthesis and preliminary biological characterization of new semisynthetic derivatives of ramoplanin.
AB  == ramoplanin is a glycolipodepsipeptide antibiotic active against gram-positive bacteria including vancomycin-resistant enterococci. ramoplanin inhibits bacterial cell wall biosynthesis by a mechanism different from that of glycopeptides and hence does not show cross-resistance with these antibiotics. the systemic use of ramoplanin has been so far prevented because of its low local tolerability when injected intravenously. to overcome this problem, the fatty acid side chain of ramoplanin was selectively removed and replaced with a variety of different carboxylic acids. many of the new ramoplanin derivatives showed antimicrobial activity similar to that of the natural precursor coupled with a significantly improved local tolerability. among them the derivative in which the 2-methylphenylacetic acid has replaced the di-unsaturated fatty acid side chain (48) was selected as the most interesting compound and submitted to further in vitro and in vivo characterization studies.

TI  == deoxyribonucleoside kinases activate nucleoside antibiotics in severely pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == common bacterial pathogens are becoming progressively more resistant to traditional antibiotics, representing a major public-health crisis. therefore, there is a need for a variety of antibiotics with alternative modes of action. in our study, several nucleoside analogs were tested against pathogenic staphylococci and streptococci. we show that pyrimidine-based nucleoside analogs, like 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (azt) and 2',2'-difluoro-2'deoxycytidine (gemcitabine), are specifically activated by the endogenous bacterial deoxyribonucleoside kinases, leading to cell death. deoxyribonucleoside kinase-deficient escherichia coli strains become highly susceptible to nucleoside analogs when they express recombinant kinases from staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes. we further demonstrate that recombinant s. aureus deoxyadenosine kinase efficiently phosphorylates the anticancer drug gemcitabine  in vitro and is therefore the key enzyme in the activation pathway. when adult mice were infected intraperitoneally with a fatal dose of s. pyogenes strain ap1  and afterwards received gemcitabine, they failed to develop a systemic infection. nucleoside analogs may therefore represent a promising alternative for combating  pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == thrombospondin-1 promotes cellular adherence of gram-positive pathogens via recognition of peptidoglycan.
AB  == thrombospondin-1 (tsp1) is a matricellular glycoprotein that has key roles in interactions between human cells and components of the extracellular matrix. here we report a novel role for the lectin tsp1 in pathogen-host interactions. binding assays and flow cytometric analysis demonstrate that streptococcus pneumoniae and other gram-positive pathogens including s. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and listeria monocytogenes interact specifically with human tsp1. we also show for the first time that host cell-bound tsp1 promotes adherence of gram-positive pathogens to human epithelial and endothelial cell lines. pretreatment of bacteria with sodium periodate but not pronase e substantially reduced tsp1-mediated bacterial adherence to host cells, suggesting that a glycoconjugate on the bacterial cell surface functions as the receptor for tsp1. lipoteichoic acids did not affect tsp1-mediated adherence of s. pneumoniae to host cells. in contrast, attachment of s. pneumoniae and other gram-positive pathogens to host cells via tsp1 was blocked by soluble peptidoglycan, indicating recognition of bacterial peptidoglycan by tsp1. in conclusion, our results demonstrate that recognition of gram-positive pathogens by tsp1 promotes bacterial colonization of host tissue cells. in this scenario, peptidoglycan functions as adhesin and tsp1  acts as a molecular bridge linking gram-positive bacteria with receptors on the host cell.

TI  == the role of superantigens of group a streptococcus and staphylococcus aureus in kawasaki disease.
AB  == purpose of review: since the first suggestion of a superantigen hypothesis for kawasaki disease over a decade ago, debate on the aetiology remains inconclusive. this article reviews recent publications that address the role of superantigens of group a streptococcus and staphylococcus aureus in the pathogenesis of kawasaki disease. recent findings: over the past few years, new superantigens produced by group a streptococcus and s. aureus have been increasingly identified, bringing the total known number to more than 30. several studies on t-cell vbeta repertoires and seroloepidemiology have demonstrated evidence for the involvement of single or multiple superantigens produced by the two pathogens. the associated superantigens differed in those studies, including streptococcal pyrogenic toxins a and c, staphylococcal enterotoxins a-c, and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1. these disparate findings suggest that the inflammation of kawasaki disease does not result from a single agent but rather a final common inflammatory pathway in genetically susceptible individuals after numerous infectious agents. summary: certain staphylococcal and streptococcal superantigens are suggested to be responsible for the development of kawasaki disease. a better understanding of the precise role of the causative agents will  lead to accurate diagnosis, more targeted therapy and an improvement of coronary  outcomes.

TI  == albomycin is an effective antibiotic, as exemplified with yersinia enterocolitica and streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == albomycin belongs to the class of sideromycins, compounds composed of iron carriers linked to antibiotic moieties. albomycin was found to be active against  bacteria that have a functional ferric hydroxamate transport system meaning that  bacteria will actively transport albomycin until they die. we examined the activity spectrum of albomycin for bacterial pathogens and found that enterobacteriaceae except species of proteus and morganella were sensitive. resistance in the two genera was due to the lack of the ferric hydroxamate transport system. among gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae were highly sensitive, whereas streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus epidermidis were resistant. the in vivo efficacy of albomycin was examined in mice infected with s. pneumoniae or yersinia enterocolitica. a single dose of 10mg albomycin/kg body weight reduced the colony-forming units of y. enterocolitica by three to four orders of magnitude. a single dose of 1mg albomycin/kg body weight was sufficient to clear  s. pneumoniae infections in mice. in direct competition experiments with wild-type s. pneumoniae and its albomycin-resistant mutant, the recovery rate of  the mutant was lower than for the wild-type indicating that the mutant had reduced fitness in the mouse model. we conclude that albomycin is effective in clearing infections caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in a  mouse model. albomycin treatment reduces the bacterial load allowing the immune system to remove residual albomycin-resistant bacteria, and as such would make albomycin-based antibiotics an adjunct to treatment. the ferrichrome transport system serves as a trojan horse to get albomycin into bacteria.

AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == antibiotic-resistant staphylococcus aureus in community-acquired pediatric neck abscesses.
AB  == objective: to determine the microbiology, particularly the prevalence of mrsa, in pediatric patients with community-acquired bacterial lymphadenitis. long considered a nosocomial organism, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) has recently emerged as a cause of community-acquired infections. resistance to other classes of antibiotics, including clindamycin, is prevalent amongst s. aureus, as well. methods: a retrospective review of the medical records and culture results of patients under the age of 18 who underwent trans-cervical surgical drainage of abscessed lymph nodes between the years 2000  and 2006. results: sixty-two patients were identified for whom microbiology data  were available. six infections were classified as parapharyngeal on imaging; the  remainder involved cervical chain lymph nodes. forty-nine patients grew microorganisms on culture while 13 collections had no growth. the most common organism was s. aureus (63% of positive cultures); followed by beta-hemolytic group a streptococcus (22%). of s. aureus isolates, 27% were oxacillin-resistant  (mrsa). all mrsa isolates were sensitive to clindamycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole; 63% were sensitive to ciprofloxacin, and 25% sensitive to erythromycin. of methicillin-sensitive s. aureus isolates, 100, 86,  and 82% were sensitive to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, clindamycin, and ciprofloxacin, respectively. all mrsa isolates were identified during the latter  half of the study period (2003-2006); none grew prior to 2003. conclusions: mrsa  is a common pathogen in community-acquired lymphadenitis, and its incidence is rising. resistance to clindamycin, a drug commonly used to treat mrsa, is prevalent amongst methicillin-sensitive s. aureus. this has important implications regarding the empiric treatment of lymphadenitis in children.

TI  == targeted drug-carrying bacteriophages as antibacterial nanomedicines.
AB  == while the resistance of bacteria to traditional antibiotics is a major public health concern, the use of extremely potent antibacterial agents is limited by their lack of selectivity. as in cancer therapy, antibacterial targeted therapy could provide an opportunity to reintroduce toxic substances to the antibacterial arsenal. a desirable targeted antibacterial agent should combine binding specificity, a large drug payload per binding event, and a programmed drug release mechanism. recently, we presented a novel application of filamentous bacteriophages as targeted drug carriers that could partially inhibit the growth  of staphylococcus aureus bacteria. this partial success was due to limitations of drug-loading capacity that resulted from the hydrophobicity of the drug. here we  present a novel drug conjugation chemistry which is based on connecting hydrophobic drugs to the phage via aminoglycoside antibiotics that serve as solubility-enhancing branched linkers. this new formulation allowed a significantly larger drug-carrying capacity of the phages, resulting in a drastic improvement in their performance as targeted drug-carrying nanoparticles. as an example for a potential systemic use for potent agents that are limited for topical use, we present antibody-targeted phage nanoparticles that carry a large  payload of the hemolytic antibiotic chloramphenicol connected through the aminoglycoside neomycin. we demonstrate complete growth inhibition toward the pathogens staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and escherichia coli with an improvement in potency by a factor of approximately 20,000 compared to the free drug.

TI  == reversal of resistance in microorganisms by help of non-antibiotics.
AB  == intracellular efflux pumps have been largely the research focus in multidrug-resistant (mdr) gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms and parasites including cancers. however, drug efflux mechanisms other than pumps per se have been observed, supported by the effects of isomeric, non-antibiotic depressant (dpr), phenothiazines and thixenes, and antidepressant (adpr) phenylpiperidine neurotropic drugs, alone or in combination with classical antimicrobials on mdr staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. of the non-antibiotics we investigated, the dpr l-thioridazine, trans-clopenthixol and isomers of phenylpiperidines nnc 20-4962 (isomer of femoxetine) and nnc 20-7052 (isomer of paroxetine) were potent antimicrobials with the least neurotropic activity, pointing to a possible general isomeric structure-activity  relationship. these compounds may be regarded as new efflux inhibitors. moreover, these isomers have considerably reduced, in some cases absent, neurotropism and reduced mammalian toxicity. this may alleviate concerns about adverse effects and therapeutic safety for infected patients in life-threatening situations where the non-antibiotic dosage would be in the lower, non-chronic dosage ranges generally  prescribed for individuals with mild mental health problems. the results point to the prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms' phospholipid/protein domain involvement of the cationic, amphiphilic, non-antibiotic dpr and adpr, with the phospholipids being the initial sites attracting and concentrating the neurotropes to induce a form of suspended animation, followed by gross changes of cell wall and membrane structure, and thereby potentiating their destructive or immobilizing effects on various as yet only hinted at resistance and efflux mechanisms. combination of appropriate isomeric non-antibiotic dpr and adpr of low neurotropism and toxicity with conventional and classical antimicrobials promises early, new therapeutic strategies salutary against microbial resistance, resistance development, pathogenicity and virulence.

TI  == usefulness of immunohistochemical diagnosis of streptococcus pneumoniae in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens compared with culture and gram stain  techniques.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is the most frequent cause of pneumonia and meningitis.  because s pneumoniae can colonize the upper respiratory tract and antibiotic treatment may inhibit growth, culture-based diagnosis can be problematic. an immunohistochemical assay using a polyclonal antibody against pneumococci was used to test formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 46 patients for whom bacterial culture results were available. samples from 26 patients demonstrated pneumococcal antigens in areas of pneumonia, meningitis, or osteomyelitis or within circulating inflammatory cells. various specimens from 18 patients grew s pneumoniae, whereas 8 had cultures that grew mixed bacteria or had no growth but were polymerase chain reaction-positive for the s pneumoniae ity a gene. pneumococcal antigens were not present in 20 cases (7 grew streptococcus pyogenes; 9, staphylococcus aureus; and 4, haemophilus influenzae). compared with culture, the immunohistochemical assay showed 100% sensitivity and  71% specificity. immunohistochemical analysis has the diagnostic advantage of correlating host inflammatory reaction with presence of pneumococci.

TI  == increased blood levels of igg reactive with secreted streptococcus pyogenes proteins in chronic plaque psoriasis.
AB  == a pathogenic role for streptococcus (s) pyogenes infections in chronic plaque psoriasis is suspected but poorly defined. we separated cellular and supernatant  proteins from s. pyogenes cultures by high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and used immunoblotting to demonstrate the diversity of serum or plasma iggs that react with elements of the proteome of this bacterium. we have shown that a substantial proportion of igg-reactive proteins from cultured s. pyogenes are secreted. the total secreted protein fraction, including diverse igg-binding elements, was subsequently used in an elisa to measure blood titers of reactive igg. this elisa showed that blood samples from patients with chronic  plaque psoriasis contained significantly higher titers of reactive igg than samples from age- and sex-matched healthy controls (p=0.0009). in contrast, neither a standard assay measuring antistreptolysin o titers nor elisas measuring titers of igg reactive with protein fractions from staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, were able to distinguish between blood samples from the two groups. these findings justify the hypothesis that s. pyogenes infections are more important in the pathogenesis of chronic plaque psoriasis than has previously been recognized, and indicate the need for further controlled therapeutic trials of antibacterial measures in this common skin disease.

AB  == a total of 18,639 clinical isolates in 19 species collected from 77 centers during 2004 in japan were tested for their susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (fqs) and other selected antibiotics. the common respiratory pathogens, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae showed a high susceptible rate against fqs. the isolation  rate of beta lactamase non-producing ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae was approximately three times as large as those of western countries. most strains of enterobacteriaceae were also susceptible to fqs. the resistance rate of escherichia coli against fqs has however been rapidly increasing so far as we surveyed since 1994. the fqs-resistant rate in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) showed approximately 90% except for 36%. of sitafloxacin while fqs-resistant rate in methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) was around 5%. the fqs-resistant rate of methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci (mrcns) was also higher than that of methicillin-susceptible coagulase negative staphylococci (mscns), however, it was lower than that of mrsa. in pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates, 32-34% from uti and 15-19% of  from rti was resistant to fqs. acinetobacter spp. showed a high susceptibility to fqs. although fqs-resistant neisseria gonorrhoeae have not been increased in western countries, it is remarkably high in japan. in this survey, isolates of approximately 85% was resistant to fqs.

TI  == oral beta-lactams applied to uncomplicated infections of skin and skin structures.
AB  == uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections (usssis) include impetigo, erysipelas, folliculitis, simple abscesses, and cellulitis. their common bacterial causative agents include staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. current guidelines predate the widespread occurrences of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) as a community-acquired pathogen and include dicloxacillin, cephalexin, erythromycin, clindamycin, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, all orally, or mupirocin ointment applied topically, for impetigo. for other usssi, recommendations are based on the probability of the infection being caused by mrsa. if methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) are known or suspected, the oral agents recommended include clindamycin, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, doxycycline, minocycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (sxt). for mrsa, recommended oral agents are linezolid, clindamycin, doxycycline, minocycline, and sxt. because community-acquired mrsa infections now predominate in patients with abscesses in  the united states, agents recommended for mrsa should be used for this indication. local susceptibility patterns should guide empiric therapy. however,  no placebo-controlled trials of usssi are available, and the evidence used to generate these recommendations is based on comparative noninferiority studies, often with wide noninferiority margins and confidence intervals. the evidence used in developing current guidelines therefore has significant limitations. further studies, such as superiority outcome studies, placebo-controlled studies, measurement of time to resolution, or other novel approaches, are needed to resolve these treatment dilemmas. until such studies are performed, the best surrogate available for predicting clinical outcome is application of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles; these describe in vivo drug behavior and allow determination of susceptibility breakpoints for predicting in  vivo antimicrobial efficacy via attainment of antimicrobial targets.

AB  == pd 0305970 and pd 0326448 are new bacterial gyrase and topoisomerase inhibitors (quinazoline-2,4-diones) that possess outstanding in vitro and in vivo activities against a wide spectrum of bacterial species including quinolone- and multidrug-resistant gram-positive and fastidious organism groups. the respective  mics (microg/ml) for pd 0305970 capable of inhibiting>or=90% of bacterial strains tested ranged from 0.125 to 0.5 versus staphylococci, 0.03 to 0.06 versus streptococci, 0.25 to 2 versus enterococci, and 0.25 to 0.5 versus moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, listeria monocytogenes, legionella pneumophila, and neisseria spp. pd 0326448 mic90s were generally twofold higher versus these same organism groups. comparative quinolone mic90 values were 4- to  512-fold higher than those of pd 0305970. in testing for frequency of resistance, pd 0305970 and levofloxacin showed low levels of development of spontaneous resistant mutants versus both staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. unlike quinolones, which target primarily gyra and parc, analysis of resistant mutants in s. pneumoniae indicates that the likely targets of pd 0305970 are gyrb and pare. pd 0305970 demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity by in vitro time-kill testing versus streptococci. this bactericidal activity carried over to in vivo testing, where pd 0305970 and pd 0326448 displayed outstanding streptococcus pyogenes 50% protective doses (pd50s) (oral dosing) of 0.7 and 3.6  mg/kg, respectively (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin pd50s were>100 and 17.7 mg/kg, respectively). pd 0305970 was also potent in a pneumococcal pneumonia mouse infection model (pd50=3.2 mg/kg) and was 22-fold more potent than levofloxacin.

TI  == skin and soft tissue infections.
AB  == primary skin infections (ie, pyodermas) typically are initiated by some breach in the epidermis, resulting in infection by organisms, such as streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus, that normally colonize the skin. host-associated factors, such as immunosuppression, vasculopathy, neuropathy, or  decreased lymphatic drainage, may predispose to skin infection. the clinical syndromes associated with skin infections are often characteristic and are defined most simplistically by anatomic distribution. although often mild and self-limited, skin infections can be more aggressive and involve deeper structures, including fascia and muscle. this article discusses skin and soft tissue infections, including impetigo, hair follicle-associated infections (ie, folliculitis, furuncles, and carbuncles) erysipelas, cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, pyomyositis, septic bursitis, and tenosynovitis.

AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to assess whether ethyl chloride fine spray (cryogesic) has antimicrobial activity. material and methods: blood agar plates supplemented with 5% horse blood were inoculated with five different organisms, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis. the plates were assessed for growth inhibition at 24 and 48 h by the microbiologist and compared with the non-sprayed control plates. results: the model showed a highly significant (p<0.0001) reduction in bacterial  count for the plates treated with fine ethyl chloride spray. the estimate of the  percentage of bacteria remaining after spraying with ethyl chloride was 42.7%, with a 95% confidence interval of 35.9-50.9%. there was no evidence that the effect of ethyl chloride fine spray was different for the different organisms (p=0.49). conclusion: the use of ethyl chloride shows bacterial count reduction but the clinical implication of this needs to be determined. the authors postulate that any statistically significant reduction can only be helpful in reducing the infection rates. this coupled with the already proven local anaesthetic effects of ethyl chloride will make it an important tool for procedures like arthrocentesis and venepunctures.

AB  == background: new antibacterial agents with activity against pathogenic strains resistant to established antibiotics are needed to treat patients with secondarily infected dermatitis (sid). objective: we sought to determine the clinical safety and efficacy of topical retapamulin ointment 1% versus oral cephalexin for the treatment of sid. methods: patients with sid were randomly assigned to retapamulin ointment 1% (twice daily [bid]) for 5 days, or oral cephalexin (500 mg bid) for 10 days. the primary efficacy end point was clinical  response at follow-up. secondary outcomes included microbiologic response at follow-up, safety, and compliance. results: retapamulin was as effective as cephalexin (clinical success rates at follow-up: 85.9% and 89.7%, respectively).  microbiologic success rates at follow-up were 87.2% for retapamulin and 91.8% for cephalexin. retapamulin was well tolerated and the topical formulation was preferred over the oral drug. limitations: an imbalance existed in the number of  patients with the clinical outcome "unable to determine" (15 retapamulin, 2 cephalexin), mainly because of their failure to attend the study visit. if those  who failed to attend visits (who did not withdraw as a result of drug-related events) are removed from the analysis, the clinical success rates are 89.9% for retapamulin and 89.7% for cephalexin. conclusions: retapamulin ointment 1% (bid)  for 5 days was as effective as oral cephalexin (bid) for 10 days in treatment of  patients with sid, and was well tolerated.

TI  == metalloantibiotics: synthesis, characterization and in-vitro antibacterial studies on cobalt (ii), copper (ii), nickel (ii) and zinc (ii) complexes with cloxacillin.
AB  == the synthesis and characterization of cloxacillin (clox) complexes with divalent  metal ions [co (ii), cu (ii), ni (ii) and zn (ii)] is described. the nature of bonding of the chelated cloxacillin and the structures of the metal complexes have been elucidated on the basis of their physical and spectroscopic data. in all the complexes, the cloxacillin acts as a uninegatively charged bidentate ligand with coordination involving the carboxylate-o and endocyclic-n of the beta-lactam ring. the new compounds have been screened for in-vitro antibacterial activity against escherichia coli (a), klebsiella pneumonae (b), proteus mirabilis (c), pseudomonas aeruginosa (d), salmonella typhi (e), shigella dysentriae (f), bacillus cereus (g), corynebacterium diphtheriae (h), staphylococcus aureus (j) and streptococcus pyogenes (k) bacterial strains. the brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in-vitro cytotoxic properties. all compounds, respectively, showed a promising activity (90%) against five bacterial species at 10 microg/ml concentration and a significant activity (52%) against the same test bacteria at 25 microg/ml concentration.

TI  == nasal carriage of pathogenic bacteria in medical students: effects of clinic exposure on prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of community-acquired and nosocomial infections worldwide. one important source of this pathogen for nosocomial infections is the nasal carriage of s. aureus among hospital personnel. there are only a few studies investigating the carriage of s. aureus in a community of medical students. oral and nasal flora of 179 medical students with varying clinical exposures were determined. oral cultures revealed no nosocomial pathogen and nasal cultures showed an increasing rate of s. aureus carriage with increasing clinical exposure. methicillin resistance also demonstrated a tendency toward increasing with increasing clinical exposure.

TI  == antibacterial properties of emla and lidocaine in wound tissue biopsies for culturing.
AB  == if a tissue biopsy from a chronic wound is sampled for culture, the antibacterial properties of local anesthetics may pose a problem in producing false-negative results. the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of emla (astrazeneca) and lidocaine on common wound pathogenic bacteria. an in vitro study of a total of 25 clinical isolates and atcc reference strains of staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant s. aureus), escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and streptococcus pyogenes was conducted. the isolates were exposed to the local anesthetic drugs (and some of their contents separately) at 35 degrees c over a 24-hour period and time-kill curves were recorded. no culture media were used and saline was used for controls. emla was found to have a rapid acting and powerful antibacterial effect and should not be  used before culturing tissue samples. lidocaine 1% was found not to inhibit the bacterial strains when exposure time was held below 2 hours. we conclude that culturing tissue from a wound biopsy is safe within 2 hours when a pure, preservative-free lidocaine 1% solution is used.

TI  == competition of bacteriophage polypeptides with native replicase proteins for binding to the dna sliding clamp reveals a novel mechanism for dna replication arrest in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == bacteriophages have evolved specific mechanisms that redirect bacterial metabolic pathways to the bacteriophage reproduction cycle. in this study, we characterized the bactericidal mechanism of two polypeptides from bacteriophages twort and g1 that target the dna sliding clamp of staphylococcus aureus. the dna sliding clamp, which tethers dna polymerase to its template and thereby confers processivity upon the enzyme, was found to be essential for the viability of s. aureus. expression of polypeptides twortorf168 and g1orf240 in s. aureus selectively inhibited dna replication which in turn resulted in cell death. both  polypeptides specifically inhibited the s. aureus dna replicase that was reconstituted in vitro but not the corresponding replicase of streptococcus pyogenes. we demonstrated that inhibition of dna synthesis is multifaceted and occurs via binding the dna sliding clamp: twortorf168 and g1orf240 bound tightly  to the dna sliding clamp and prevented both its loading onto dna and its interaction with dna polymerase c. these results elucidate the impact of bacteriophage polypeptide expression upon dna replication in the growing cell.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of bovine dialyzable leukocyte extract.
AB  == the rapidly developing resistance of many infectious pathogenic organisms to modern drugs has spurred scientists to search for new sources of antibacterial compounds. one potential candidate, bdle (dialysis at 10 to 12 kda cut-off) and its fractions ("s" and "l" by 3.5 kda cut-off and i, ii, iii, and iv by molecular exclusion chromatography), was evaluated for antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacterial strains (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, lysteria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella  typhi) using standard antimicrobial assays. a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of bdle and its fractions was determined by agar and broth dilutions methods. only bdle and its "s" fraction had an effect upon all bacteria evaluated (mic ranging from 0.29 to 0.62 u/ml), and the bactericidal and bacteriostatic effects (evaluated by mtt assay) were bacterial species-dependent. these results  showed a remarkable in vitro antibacterial property of bdle against several pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == infective pyomyositis and myositis in children in the era of community-acquired,  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infection.
AB  == background: cases of pyomyositis and myositis have been increasing in frequency at texas children's hospital (houston) since 2000. the increase appears to correlate with the emergence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). methods: the medical records of patients with pyomyositis and myositis hospitalized at texas children's hospital during the period from january 2000 through december 2005 were reviewed. available s. aureus isolates were obtained for susceptibility testing, to determine the presence of pvl (luks-pv and lukf-pv), and for pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis. results: forty-five previously healthy children with bacterial pyomyositis or myositis were analyzed. the causes were s. aureus (in 57.8% of children) and streptococcus pyogenes (in 2.2%); 40.0% of children had negative culture results. the number of cases increased between 2000 and 2005, primarily as a result of an  increase in the prevalence of community-acquired mrsa. the mean patient age was 5.5 years (range, 0.06-15 years). the thigh (40.0% of children) and pelvis (28.9%) were the most commonly affected sites. the mean abscess diameter was 3.5  cm. eighteen children required at least 1 muscle drainage procedure. of the 24 available s. aureus isolates (15 community-acquired mrsa isolates and 9 community-acquired, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus [mssa] isolates), 16 were found to be usa300 by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and 17 carried pvl. patients with community-acquired mrsa, usa300, and/or pvl-positive strains required more drainage procedures than did those with community-acquired mssa, non-usa300, and/or pvl-negative strains (81% vs. 40% [p=.05], 82% vs. 29% [p=.02], and 81% vs. 38% [p=.07], respectively). conclusions: community-acquired  mrsa is an increasing cause of pyomyositis and myositis in children. community-acquired mrsa, usa300, pvl-positive s. aureus isolates caused more severe disease than did community-acquired mssa, non-usa300, and pvl-negative isolates, respectively.

TI  == sigma x induces competence gene expression in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == although not thought to become competent for dna uptake, the bacterium streptococcus pyogenes appears to encode within its genome the dna uptake and recombination machinery required for competence. the promoters of these genes contain a conserved sequence, cin-box, which is recognized by the s. pyogenes alternative rna polymerase sigma factor x. using microarray technology, we found  that sigma x induced the expression of competence genes in s. pyogenes. real-time rt-pcr was performed to confirm that the expression of these transcripts was induced 2-265-fold by sigma x. of the eight cin-box loci induced, femb, the ortholog a virulence factor in staphylococcus aureus, was shown to be transcribed in vitro by rna polymerase containing sigma x, indicating that sigma x directly activates expression of this cin-box gene. sigma x-dependent induction of genes encoding competence machinery in s. pyogenes raises the possibility that some strains of this human pathogen can develop competence for genetic transformation.

TI  == visible-light-induced bactericidal activity of a nitrogen-doped titanium photocatalyst against human pathogens.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of photocatalytic titanium dioxide (tio(2)) substrates is induced primarily by uv light irradiation. recently, nitrogen- and carbon-doped tio(2) substrates were shown to exhibit photocatalytic activities under visible-light illumination. their antibacterial activity, however, remains  to be quantified. in this study, we demonstrated that nitrogen-doped tio(2) substrates have superior visible-light-induced bactericidal activity against escherichia coli compared to pure tio(2) and carbon-doped tio(2) substrates. we also found that protein- and light-absorbing contaminants partially reduce the bactericidal activity of nitrogen-doped tio(2) substrates due to their light-shielding effects. in the pathogen-killing experiment, a significantly higher proportion of all tested pathogens, including shigella flexneri, listeria  monocytogenes, vibrio parahaemolyticus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and acinetobacter baumannii, were killed by visible-light-illuminated nitrogen-doped tio(2) substrates than by pure tio(2) substrates. these findings suggest that nitrogen-doped tio(2) has potential application in the development of alternative disinfectants for environmental and medical usages.

TI  == autophagy in innate immunity against intracellular bacteria.
AB  == many pathogenic bacteria can invade phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells and colonize them intracellularly, then become disseminated to other cells. the endocytic degradation pathway is thought to be the only prevention against such intracellular pathogens. autophagy, a fundamental cellular homeostasis pathway that operates with the intracellular degradation/recycling system, causes the turnover of cellular components by delivering portions of the cytoplasm and organelles to lysosomes. recently, we reported that autophagic degradation is a previously unrecognized effector of host innate immunity. streptococcus pyogenes  (group a streptococcus; gas) successfully enters human epithelial cells via endocytosis. gas immediately escapes from the endosomes to the cytoplasm and gains a replicative niche, after which gas in the cytoplasm is trapped in autophagosome-like compartments and degraded upon fusion with lysosomes. this process indicates that autophagy plays a protective role in infectious diseases.  we also found that autophagic degradation was induced against staphylococcus aureus, while methicillin-resistant s. aureus were resistant to autophagic degradation. the present review focuses on the protective function of autophagy against bacterial invasion of cells.

TI  == how long do nosocomial pathogens persist on inanimate surfaces? a systematic review.
AB  == background: inanimate surfaces have often been described as the source for outbreaks of nosocomial infections. the aim of this review is to summarize data on the persistence of different nosocomial pathogens on inanimate surfaces. methods: the literature was systematically reviewed in medline without language restrictions. in addition, cited articles in a report were assessed and standard  textbooks on the topic were reviewed. all reports with experimental evidence on the duration of persistence of a nosocomial pathogen on any type of surface were  included. results: most gram-positive bacteria, such as enterococcus spp. (including vre), staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), or streptococcus pyogenes, survive for months on dry surfaces. many gram-negative species, such as acinetobacter spp., escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, or shigella spp., can also survive for months. a few others, such as bordetella pertussis, haemophilus influenzae, proteus vulgaris, or vibrio cholerae, however, persist only for days. mycobacteria, including mycobacterium tuberculosis, and spore-forming bacteria, including clostridium difficile, can also survive for months on surfaces. candida albicans as the most important nosocomial fungal pathogen can survive up to 4 months on surfaces. persistence of other yeasts, such as torulopsis glabrata, was described to be similar (5 months) or shorter (candida parapsilosis, 14 days). most viruses from the respiratory tract, such as corona, coxsackie, influenza, sars or rhino virus, can persist on  surfaces for a few days. viruses from the gastrointestinal tract, such as astrovirus, hav, polio- or rota virus, persist for approximately 2 months. blood-borne viruses, such as hbv or hiv, can persist for more than one week. herpes viruses, such as cmv or hsv type 1 and 2, have been shown to persist from  only a few hours up to 7 days. conclusion: the most common nosocomial pathogens may well survive or persist on surfaces for months and can thereby be a continuous source of transmission if no regular preventive surface disinfection is performed.

TI  == development of a broad-range 16s rdna real-time pcr for the diagnosis of septic arthritis in children.
AB  == the broad-range pcr has been successfully developed to search for fastidious, slow-growing or uncultured bacteria, and is mostly used when an empirical antibiotic treatment has already been initiated. the technique generally involves standard pcr targeting the gene coding for 16s ribosomal rna, and includes a post-pcr visualisation step on agarose gel which is a potential source of cross-over contamination. in addition, interpretation of the presence of amplified products on gels can be difficult. we then developed a new sybr green-based, universal real-time pcr assay targeting the gene coding for 16s ribosomal rna, coupled with sequencing of amplified products. the real-time pcr assay was evaluated on 94 articular fluid samples collected from children hospitalised for suspicion of septic arthritis, as compared to the results obtained with bacterial cultures and conventional broad-range pcr. dna extraction was performed with the automated magna pure system. we could detect dna from various bacterial pathogens including fastidious bacteria (kingella kingae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, salmonella spp, staphylococcus  aureus) from 23% of cases of septic arthritis giving negative culture results. the real-time technique was easier to interpret and allowed to detect four more cases than conventional pcr. pcr based molecular techniques appear to be essential to perform in case of suspicion of septic arthritis, provided the increase of the diagnosed bacterial etiologies. real-time pcr technique is a sensitive and reliable technique, which can replace conventional pcr for clinical specimens with negative bacterial culture.

AB  == the effect of topical application of phytoconstituents (fraction i, ii and iii) fractionated from a hydroalcohol extract of the bark of the plant, terminalia arjuna, was assessed on the healing of rat dermal wounds using in vivo models. the results indicated a statistically significant increase in the tensile strength of the incision wounds and the percent epithelialization of excision wounds compared with control (p < 0.05). however, topical treatment with fraction i, consisting mainly of tannins, was found to demonstrate a maximum increase in the tensile strength of incision wounds. even with respect to excision wounds, the fastest rate of epithelialization was seen with fraction i. hexosamine estimation of granulation tissue obtained from excision wounds revealed an increase in the hexosamine content with fraction i compared with the control. in  addition, fraction i from the hydroalcohol extract of arjuna bark possessed antimicrobial activity against tested microorganisms such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes but not candida albicans. these results strongly document the beneficial effects of fraction i, consisting mainly of tannins, of terminalia arjuna in the acceleration of the healing process. thus, the present study validates the claim  made with respect to the plant as well as corroborating the astringent effect of  tannins by drawing the tissues closer together.

TI  == coenzyme q10 production in recombinant escherichia coli strains engineered with a heterologous decaprenyl diphosphate synthase gene and foreign mevalonate pathway.
AB  == in the present work, escherichia coli dh5alpha was metabolically engineered for coq(10) production by the introduction of decaprenyl diphosphate synthase gene (ddsa) from agrobacterium tumefaciens. grown in 2ytg medium (1.6% tryptone, 1% yeast extract, 0.5% nacl, and 0.5% glycerol) with an initial ph of 7, the recombinant e. coli was capable of coq(10) production up to 470 microg/gdcw (dry  cell weight). this value could be further elevated to 900 microg/gdcw simply by increasing the initial culture ph from 7 to 9. supplementation of 4-hydroxy benzoate did not improve the productivity any further. however, engineering of a  lower mevalonate semi-pathway so as to increase the isopentenyl diphosphate (ipp) supply of the recombinant strain using exogenous mevalonate efficiently increased the coq(10) production. lower mevalonate semi-pathways of staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and saccharomyces cerevisiae were tested. among these, the pathway of streptococcus pneumoniae proved to be superior, yielding coq(10) production of 2,700+/-115 microg/gdcw when supplemented with exogenous mevalonate of 3 mm. in order to construct a complete mevalonate pathway, the upper semi-pathway of the same bacterium, streptococcus pneumoniae, was recruited. in a recombinant e. coli dh5alpha harboring three plasmids encoding for upper and lower mevalonate semi-pathways as well as ddsa enzyme, the heterologous mevalonate pathway could convert endogenous acetyl-coa to ipp, resulting in coq(10) production of up to 2,428+/-75 microg/gdcw, without mevalonate supplementation. in contrast, a whole  mevalonate pathway constructed in a single operon was found to be less efficient. however, it provided coq(10) production of up to 1,706+/-86 microg/gdcw, which was roughly 1.9 times higher than that obtained by ddsa alone.

TI  == lower extremity reconstruction after necrotising fasciitis and necrotic skin lesions using a porcine-derived skin substitute.
AB  == seven consecutive clinical cases of necrotising fasciitis or necrotic skin lesions (42-78 years old; average 65.0 years of age, three females and four males) due to group a streptococcus, group b streptococcus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the lower extremities, who demonstrated rapid systemic symptoms, were investigated for the usefulness of a bilayer artificial dermis, derived from porcine tendons, over 4 +/- 2.4 years (1-7 years). all surgical debridement was confirmed as sufficiently deep and wide for clinically infected lesions and artificial dermis was applied to all wounds.  the average interval to secondary split-thickness skin grafting was about 17.5 days (17.5 +/- 2.44 days, 21 days max., 14 days min.) and the average thickness was 0.009 +/- 0.0022 in. (range: 0.006 - 0.012 in.). no clinical problems were noted during the application of the artificial dermis and the subsequent skin grafting. since, the donated skin graft was thin, the morbidity was minimised. the use of artificial dermis after extensive surgical debridement in necrotising  fasciitis was easy and effective. local or systemic infection was negligible.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of clove and thyme extracts.
AB  == objective: it has been postulated that geographical locations of the herbs affect the constituents of their essential oils and thus the degree of their antimicrobial action. this study examine two samples of clove obtained from sri lanka and zanzibar and two samples of thyme from iran and oman to determine the antimicrobial potential of their extracted oils. method: the active agents in each plant were extracted by steam distillation and by boiling. the antimicrobial activities of the extracts were determined at neat and by two-fold dilutions in well agar diffusion technique using staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, corynebacterium species, salmonella species, bacteroides fragilis and candida albicans. results: all oil extracts possessed antimicrobial activity against all bacteria and yeast tested.  their water extracts exhibited lower antimicrobial activity, though thyme aqueous extract was active only against s. aureus. the lowest concentration of antimicrobial activity (0.1% i.e., 1:1024) was obtained with thyme oil extract using candida albicans. there was no significant difference in antimicrobial activity between clove obtained from sri lanka or zanzibar or thyme obtained from iran or oman. conclusion: our experiment showed that the country of origin of the herbs has no effect on their antimicrobial activity. however, further work is necessary to ascertain why candida albicans displayed remarkable degree of sensitivity with the extracts than all the other organisms test.

TI  == the role of anaerobic bacteria in acute and chronic mastoiditis.
AB  == mastoiditis (m) is the most common intratemporal complication of otitis media. the incidence of m has decreased since the advent of antimicrobial agents. in the last decade, however, there has been a marked increased in the incidence of acute m in several communities, sometimes in association with the growing resistance of pneumococci. streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus and haemophillus influenzae are the most common organisms recovered in acute m. several recent studies demonstrated the predominance of pseudomonas aeruginosa in this infection. however, because p. aeruginosa colonizes the ear canal it can contaminate specimens obtained through the non-sterile ear canal. p. aeruginosa, enterobacteriaceae, s. aureus and anaerobic bacteria are the most common isolates in chronic m. anaerobes predominate in studies where adequate methods for their isolation are employed. management of uncomplicated m requires  the administration of parenteral antimicrobial therapy and myringotomy with or without tympanostomy tube placement. if no improvement occurs within 48 h, surgical intervention and drainage may be necessary. the procedure generally employed is simple mastoidectomy, and tympanostomy tube placement. radical mastoidectomy is performed only if there is no improvement after simple mastoidectomy.

AB  == with the appearance of penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, there has been increasing debate concerning antimicrobial treatments for acute upper respiratory tract infection (aurti) and acute otitis media in children. this study compares the nasopharyngeal bacterial flora in patients with aurti (aurti group; 710 subjects) and healthy subjects (hs group; 380 subjects). the comparisons were made between subjects aged 6 years or younger (0-6 subgroup: 330 subjects), between 7 and 74 years (7-74 subgroup: 668 subjects), and 75 years and older (92 subjects), because the subjects were subgrouped as described above dependent on the maturity of the protective immunity. in the hs group 7-74 subgroup, viridans group streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative  staphylococci, and corynebacterium sp. with a detection rate of 10% or more were  classified as normal nasal flora (nnf), and streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis were classified as  drum cavity pathogens (dcp). in the 0-6 subgroup, although the detection rate for dcp bacteria in the aurti group tended to be high, it did not reach a significant difference, whereas the detection rate for nnf bacteria was significantly lower.  this trend was also observed to some degree in the other age subgroup. in the 0-6 subgroup, leukocyte infiltration observed with a microscope indicated the closest relationship between s. pneumoniae detection rate and detection quantity. these results suggest that in the 0-6 subgroup the tendency for patients with aurti to  have nnf bacteria as well as dcp bacteria should be taken into consideration.

AB  == we previously showed that covalent conjugates between poly-l-lysine and chlorin(e6) were efficient photosensitizers (ps) of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the polycationic molecular constructs increased binding and penetration of the ps into impermeable gram-negative cells. we have now prepared a novel set of second-generation polycationic conjugates between chlorin(e6) and three molecular forms of polyethyleneimine (pei): a small linear, a small cross-linked, and a large cross-linked molecule. the conjugates were characterized by high-pressure liquid chromatography and tested for their ability to kill a panel of pathogenic microorganisms, the gram-positive staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, the gram-negative escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the yeast candida albicans, after exposure to low levels of red light. the large cross-linked molecule efficiently killed all organisms, while the linear conjugate killed gram-positive bacteria and c. albicans. the small cross-linked conjugate was the least efficient antimicrobial  ps and its remarkably low activity could not be explained by reduced photochemical quantum yield or reduced cellular uptake. in contrast to polylysine conjugates, the pei conjugates were resistant to degradation by proteases such as trypsin that hydrolyze lysine-lysine peptide bonds, the advantage of protease stability combined with the ready availability of pei suggests these molecules may be superior to polylysine-ps conjugates for photodynamic therapy of localized infections.

TI  == changing epidemiology of outpatient bacteremia in 3- to 36-month-old children after the introduction of the heptavalent-conjugated pneumococcal vaccine.
AB  == background: the introduction of routine vaccination with heptavalent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine has changed the overall incidence of bacteremia in children  3 months-3 years old. objective: to describe the changing incidence and etiology  of bacteremia in previously healthy toddlers presenting to outpatient clinical settings. methods: retrospective case series of all blood cultures obtained between september 1998 and august 2003 in kaiser permanente northern california outpatient clinics and emergency departments from previously healthy children 3 months-3 years old. results: implementation of routine vaccination with the conjugated pneumococcal vaccine resulted in an 84% reduction of streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia (1.3-0.2%) and a 67% reduction in overall bacteremia (1.6-0.7%) in the study population. the rate of blood culture isolation of contaminating organisms remained unchanged at 1.8%; therefore, by the end of the  study, >70% of organisms identified in blood cultures were contaminants. during the 5 study years, total blood cultures drawn decreased by 35% in outpatient pediatric clinics but remained unchanged in emergency departments. by 2003, one-third of all pathogenic organisms isolated from blood cultures were escherichia coli, one-third were non-vaccine serotype s. pneumoniae, the majority of the remaining one-third were staphylococcus aureus, salmonella spp., neisseria meningitidis and streptococcus pyogenes. in our population of children routinely  immunized with the conjugated pneumococcal vaccine, a white blood cell count >15,000 by itself is a poor predictor of bacteremia in the febrile toddler (sensitivity, 74.0%; specificity, 54.5%; positive predictive value, 1.5%; negative predictive value, 99.5%). conclusion: in the united states, routine vaccinations with haemophilus influenzae type b and s. pneumoniae vaccines have made bacteremia in the previously healthy toddler a rare event. as the incidence  of pneumococcal bacteremia has decreased, e. coli, salmonella spp. and staphylococcus aureus have increased in relative importance. the use of the white blood cell count alone to guide the empiric use of antibiotics is not indicated.  new guidelines are needed to approach the previously healthy febrile toddler in the outpatient setting.

TI  == [lethal end of a group c streptococcal necrotizing fasciitis in a healthy female].
AB  == the necrotizing fasciitis (nf) is a life threatening, quickly progressive soft-tissue infection characterized by necrosis of the superficial fascia. it is  very rare in the head and neck region. usually this infection attacks weak patients with chronic diseases, such as diabetes or cancer. in adults the most common organisms implicated in craniocervical nf are streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus viridans and peptostreptococci. the typical  infectious entrance is a deep wound, after surgery or a peritonsillar abscess. we describe a very unusual case of a craniocervical nf with a deadly outcome in a sixty year old female. the patient had no chronic diseases and went to an ent doctor with an acute tonsillitis for 3 days. within the next three hours the general condition became dangerous to life. therefore she was brought to us for immediate therapy. but despite fast and aggressive surgery of the neck, throat and thorax the patient died of a toxic schock syndrome on the intensive care unit within a few hours. the microbiology showed just group c streptococcus. the postmortem examination confirmed the nf with starting point in the left tonsil after acute tonsillitis. such a foudroyant course of a craniocervical nf with group c streptococci in a healthy patient is not published yet.

TI  == epithelial cells are sensitive detectors of bacterial pore-forming toxins.
AB  == epithelial cells act as an interface between human mucosal surfaces and the surrounding environment. as a result, they are responsible for the initiation of  local immune responses, which may be crucial for prevention of invasive infection. here we show that epithelial cells detect the presence of bacterial pore-forming toxins (including pneumolysin from streptococcus pneumoniae, alpha-hemolysin from staphylococcus aureus, streptolysin o from streptococcus pyogenes, and anthrolysin o from bacillus anthracis) at nanomolar concentrations, far below those required to cause cytolysis. phosphorylation of p38 mapk appears  to be a conserved response of epithelial cells to subcytolytic concentrations of  bacterial poreforming toxins, and this activity is inhibited by the addition of high molecular weight osmolytes to the extracellular medium. by sensing osmotic stress caused by the insertion of a sublethal number of pores into their membranes, epithelial cells may act as an early warning system to commence an immune response, while the local density of toxin-producing bacteria remains low. osmosensing may thus represent a novel innate immune response to a common bacterial virulence strategy.

TI  == synthesis and antibacterial activity of novel c12 vinyl ketolides.
AB  == a novel series of c12 vinyl erythromycin derivatives have been discovered which exhibit in vitro and in vivo potency against key respiratory pathogens. the c12 modification involves replacing the natural c12 methyl group in the erythromycin  core with a vinyl group via chemical synthesis. from the c12 vinyl macrolide core, a series of c12 vinyl ketolides was prepared. several compounds were found  to be potent against macrolide-sensitive and -resistant bacteria. the c12 vinyl ketolides 6j and 6k showed a similar antimicrobial spectrum and comparable activity to the commercial ketolide telithromycin. however, the pharmacokinetic profiles of c12 vinyl ketolides 6j and 6k in rats differ from that of telithromycin by having higher lung-to-plasma ratios, larger volumes of distribution, and longer half-lives. these pharmacokinetic differences have a pharmacodynamic effect as both 6j and 6k exhibited better in vivo efficacy than telithromycin in rat lung infection models against streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae.

TI  == peptidoglycan and peptidoglycan-specific th1 cells in psoriatic skin lesions.
AB  == we have previously demonstrated, in psoriatic skin lesions, the presence of a subset of dermal cd4+ t cells that produce interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) in response to a mixture of cell wall proteins extracted from group a streptococci.  however, the identity of the antigen(s) involved is unknown. to investigate the hypothesis that peptidoglycan (pg), the major constituent of the streptococcal cell wall, acts as a t cell activator in psoriasis, we performed in situ analysis to detect antigen-presenting cells containing pg in lesional versus non-lesional  skin, and determined proliferation and ifn-gamma responses of lesional skin t cells. increased numbers of pg-containing cells were detected in the dermal papillae and cellular infiltrates of guttate and chronic plaque skin lesions compared with normal and non-lesional psoriatic skin. a varying proportion of these were cd68+ macrophages, but the remaining cells did not double stain for either langerhans' or dendritic cell markers. psoriatic dermal streptococcal-specific cd4+ t cell lines proliferated and produced ifn-gamma in a self hla-dr allele-restricted manner in response to streptococcal pg, excluding mitogenic or superantigenic stimulation, but were unresponsive to staphylococcal  pg. similarly, psoriatic staphylococcus-specific t cell lines recognized staphylococcal, but not streptococcal, pg by ifn-gamma production. the presence of pg-containing macrophages in close association with pg-specific cd4+ t cells in lesional skin suggests that pg may be responsible, at least in part, for t cell activation in psoriasis.

TI  == development of serum igm antibodies against superantigens of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes in kawasaki disease.
AB  == to serologically determine the association of microbial superantigens and the pathogenesis of kawasaki disease (kd), we conducted a case-control study. serum igg and igm antibodies against staphylococcal enterotoxin a (sea), seb, sec, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (tsst-1), and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin a (spea) were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 293 serum samples from 65 kd patients on clinical days 1-28 and 120 control samples. the administration of immunoglobulin products, which contain high concentrations of igg antibodies against all the superantigens, directly elevated antitoxin igg antibodies in kd patients. in contrast, antitoxin igm antibodies were not detected in immunoglobulin products. actually, we found a significant elevation of igm antibodies against sea in kd patients in the first (median titre: 0.020, p < 0.01 versus control), second (0.024, p < 0.001), third (0.030, p < 0.001) and fourth (0.038, p < 0.001) weeks, compared to the controls (0.015). significant differences of igm antibodies were also true for seb, tsst-1, and spea throughout the first to fourth weeks, and for sec throughout the second to fourth weeks. the prevalence of kd patients having high igm titres (> mean + 2sd of control values) to the 5 superantigens was increased with the clinical weeks, and reached 29-43%  of kd subjects at the fourth week. this is the first study that describes kinetics of igm antibodies against superantigens and clarifies the serological significance throughout the clinical course of kd. our results suggest that multiple superantigens involve in the pathogenesis of kd.

AB  == case report: a 5-year-old girl was hospitalised for fever, abdominal and lumbar pain, associated with general impairment state and a whitlow. one of the blood cultures and csf grew a beta haemolytic streptococcus, muscular echography and mri showed paravertebral myositis, which was complicated by an epidural abscess.  the outcome was good with medical treatment alone. discussion: streptococcal myositis is a rare and severe skeletal muscle infection caused by a beta haemolytic streptococcus. it is characterized by a muscle necrosis, without abscess formation. it has to be distinguished from pyomyositis, usually caused by staphylococcus aureus, where a muscle abscess occurs, which must be treated by surgical drainage and antibiotics. prognosis of this infection is poorer than other muscle infections such as pyomyositis, with a high mortality rate. the diagnosis is difficult and often delayed. practitioners should keep in mind this  diagnosis, even if symptoms are non specific, in front of an undetermined infectious syndrome associated with pain, and make an echography or nuclear magnetic resonance imaging to confirm the diagnosis.

TI  == integrin-linked kinase is an essential link between integrins and uptake of bacterial pathogens by epithelial cells.
AB  == entry of streptococcus pyogenes or group a streptococcus (gas) into host cells is mediated by fibronectin bound to surface proteins, m1 or prtf1, forming a bridge  to alpha5beta1 integrins. this interaction leads to cytoskeletal rearrangement and uptake of streptococci. we postulated that integrin-linked kinase (ilk), which directly associates with integrins, is the universal link between integrins and several bacterial pathogens. we showed that inhibition of ilk expression by sirna silencing, or ilk kinase activity by chemical inhibitors or expression of a dominant negative form of ilk reduced m1-mediated invasion of epithelial cells up to 80%. to evaluate the ilk requirement for prtf1-mediated gas invasion, a m1-prtf1+ recombinant strain within the m1 background was constructed. inhibition of ilk kinase activity also significantly reduced invasion of epithelial cells by this recombinant and wild-type strain jrs4 that expresses prtf1. in addition, impaired ilk kinase activity results in significant reduction of integrin-dependent invasion mediated by invasins of two other important pathogens, staphylococcus aureus and yersinia spp. this study suggests that bacterial pathogens evolved different molecules and strategies to exploit the host integrin signalling pathway for their survival.

TI  == intranasal exposure to bacterial superantigens induces airway inflammation in hla class ii transgenic mice.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is widely prevalent in the nasopharynges of healthy individuals (carriers) but can also cause serious infections. s. aureus can elaborate a variety of superantigen exotoxins in "carrier" or "pathogenic" states. streptococcus pyogenes can also colonize the nasopharynx and elaborate superantigens. unlike the acute effects of superantigen exotoxins absorbed through the gut or vaginal mucosa, little is known regarding the pathogenesis of  superantigens entering through the intranasal route. in the current study, we evaluated the local and systemic effects of staphylococcal enterotoxin b (seb) and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin a (spea) delivered through the intranasal route. superantigens were administered intranasally on multiple occasions, and experimental animals were sacrificed on day 8 for experimental analyses. seb-induced airway inflammation was more pronounced for hla-dr3 transgenic mice than for balb/c mice, consistent with bacterial superantigens binding more efficiently to human than murine major histocompatibility complex class ii. the nature of the airway inflammation in hla-dr3 mice was determined by the concentration of seb applied intranasally. low concentrations (20 ng) induced eosinophilic airway inflammation as well as eosinophil degranulation, whereas intranasal exposure to higher concentrations (2,000 ng) resulted in neutrophilic  airway inflammation, permanent airway destruction, toxic shock, and mortality. seb-induced eosinophilic inflammatory response was enhanced in signal transducer  and activator of transcription (stat)-4-deficient hla-dq8 transgenic mice with defective interleukin-12 signaling. intranasal administration of spea induced airway inflammation and systemic immune activation in hla-dq8 transgenic mice. in conclusion, repeated chronic intranasal exposure to bacterial superantigens causes airway inflammation and systemic immune activation.

AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to investigate in oral breathing children the qualitative and quantitative effects on aerobic and facultatively anaerobic oropharyngeal microflora of respiratory function improved by rapid palatal expansion (rpe). methods: in an open clinical trial, we studied 50 oral breathers, aged 8 to 14 years and suffering from both maxillary constriction and  posterior cross-bite. at baseline, patients were examined by a single otorhinolaryngologist (ent), confirming nasal obstruction in all subjects by posterior rhino-manometric test. patients were evaluated three times by oropharyngeal swabs:1) at baseline (t = 0); 2) after palatal spreading out (t = 1); and 3) at the end of rpe treatment (t = 2). with regard to the microbiological aspect, the most common and potentially pathogenic oral microrganisms (i.e. streptococcus pyogenes, diplococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus spp, branhamella catarrhalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, candida albicans) were specifically detected in proper culture plates, isolated colonies were identified by means of biochemical tests and counted by calibrated loop. the data were analyzed by means of the following tests: chi-square test, fisher's exact test and wilcoxon's test. results: after the use of rme there was a statistically significant decrease of staphylococcus aureus stock at cfu/mlat t1(p = 0.0005; z = -3,455 by wilcoxon rank test) and t2  (p < 0.0001; z = -4,512 by wilcoxon rank test) vs t0. no significant changes were found for the other examined microrganisms. conclusion: our data suggest that rpe therapy in oral breathers may strongly reduce the pathogenic aerobic and facultatively anaerobic microflora in the oral pharynx after a normalization of the upper airways function, and may reduce the risk of respiratory infections.

TI  == [community-acquired acute maxillary sinusitis or rhinosinusitis in adults in france: current management].
AB  == sinus infections, often viral, are a common reason for physician visits. the multiplicity of clinical presentations makes its diagnosis difficult. the problem is to recognize bacterial infection without additional testing, except in cases of treatment failures, complications or relapse. patients with signs suggestive of rhinosinusitis fall into one of four basic clinical situations: common colds,  'doubtful' rhinosinusitis, apparent acute maxillary bacterial rhinosinusitis, and complications. anterior rhinoscopy may help confirm diagnosis. current bacterial  epidemiology is based on the results of clinical studies, microbial ecology, and  samples taken in cases of treatment failure. the two bacteria isolated most frequently are streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, both of which pose resistance problems. moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus are isolated less often. the dominant issue in management of acute rhinosinusitis is whether to use antibiotic or symptomatic treatment. for viral infections, antibiotic therapy is useless and highly inadvisable. for 'doubtful' infections, symptomatic treatment is likely to lead to recovery. the use of non-recommended antibiotics also increases the risk of selection of resistant bacteria. when bacterial rhinosinusitis is strongly suspected, recourse to antibiotic treatment is recommended in view of the benefits in this situation  (afssaps 2005). this treatment is probabilistic, should be decided at the end of  the consultation, and follows the afssaps guidelines.

TI  == purification and characterization of lpxtgase from staphylococcus aureus: the amino acid composition mirrors that found in the peptidoglycan.
AB  == bacterial surface proteins are important molecules in the infectivity and survival of pathogens. surface proteins on gram-positive bacteria have been shown to attach via a transpeptidase, termed sortase, that cleaves an lpxtg sequence found close to the c termini of nearly all surface proteins on these bacteria. we previously identified a unique enzyme (lpxtgase) from streptococcus pyogenes that also cleaves the lpxtg motif with a catalytic activity higher than that of sortase, suggesting that it plays an important role in the attachment process. we have now purified and characterized an lpxtgase from staphylococcus aureus and found that it has both similar and unique features compared to the s. pyogenes enzyme. the s. aureus enzyme is glycosylated and contains unusual amino acids, like its streptococcal counterpart. like the streptococcal enzyme, staphylococcal lpxtgase has an overrepresentation of amino acids found in the peptidoglycan, i.e., glutamine/glutamic acid, glycine, alanine, and lysine, and furthermore, we  find that these amino acids are present in the enzyme at precisely the same ratio at which they are found in the peptidoglycan for the respective organism. this suggests that enzymes responsible for wall assembly may also play a role in the construction of lpxtgase.

AB  == background: erysipelas is a bacterial infection of the dermis and hypodermis, mostly of streptococcal origin. bullous erysipelas represents a severe form of the disease. objective: to evaluate the clinical and microbiological characteristics and treatment of bullous erysipelas. methods: patients with a diagnosis of bullous erysipelas who were treated at the department of dermatology, university hospital of heraklion, crete, greece, between the years 1996 and 2001 were retrospectively studied. results: fourteen patients (11 women, 3 men) with bullous erysipelas were evaluated. the lesions were located on the legs and face in 9 and 4 patients, respectively. the median duration of disease before hospital admission was 4 days. eight patients had fever at presentation. local trauma and various lesions were common causes for pathogen entry. the initial empirical antibiotic treatment included intravenous beta-lactams and was  modified according to the sensitivities of the isolated strains. staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 7 (50%), while s. warneri, streptococcus pyogenes and escherichia coli grew from the lesions of 3 other patients. six out of 7 s. aureus strains were methicillin resistant (mrsa) but susceptible to several other non-beta-lactam antibiotics such as quinolones, vancomycin, rifampicin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. conclusion: our findings suggest that s. aureus is frequently involved in and probably contributes in synergy with beta-hemolytic streptococci to the complicated course of bullous erysipelas. the frequency of mrsa isolation suggests that beta-lactam antibiotics may not be sufficient for the treatment of bullous erysipelas anymore, at least in areas with a high incidence of mrsa strains. the role of other classes of antibiotics providing adequate coverage for mrsa has to be evaluated in prospective clinical trials.

AB  == although hundreds of microbial species reside in the human intestinal tract, comparatively few (e.g., escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, enterococcus  faecalis, etc.) are typically associated with systemic infection in postsurgical, shock, and trauma patients. syndecan-1 is the predominant cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on epithelia, and there is substantial evidence that heparan sulfate participates in interactions of a variety of frankly pathogenic microbes with mammalian cells. to investigate the role of syndecan-1 in interactions of enteric flora with intestinal epithelium, bacteria that might  use the enterocyte as a portal of entry for systemic infection (including e. faecalis, e. coli, and other enterobacteria, and several species of staphylococci and streptococci) were studied for their abilities to interact with syndecan-1. streptococcus bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis showed increased adherence to arh-77 cells transfected to express syndecan-1. heparin, a heparan sulfate analog, inhibited internalization of s. bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, and s. aureus by ht-29 enterocytes (prominent  syndecan-1 expression), but not caco-2 enterocytes (relatively low syndecan-1 expression). data from experiments with chinese hamster ovary cells with altered  glycosaminoglycan expression indicated that heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (glycosaminoglycans on the syndecan-1 ectodomain) participated in bacterial interactions with mammalian cells. thus, although e. faecalis, e. coli, and other gram-negative enterobacteria did not appear to interact with syndecan-1, this heparan sulfate proteoglycan may mediate enterocyte interactions with some staphylococci and streptococci that are known to cause systemic infections in specific populations of high-risk, immunosuppressed, postsurgical,  and trauma patients.

TI  == community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus: an emerging problem in the athletic population.
AB  == participants of contact sports are at risk for outbreaks of skin and soft tissue  infection. causes of reported outbreaks include staphylococcus aureus, herpes simplex virus, streptococcus pyogenes, and several fungi. although once thought of solely as a nosocomial pathogen, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus has been identified as an emerging problem in the community, particularly in the  athletic population. despite a recent increase in reported outbreaks of community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus soft tissue infection in athletic teams, many sports medicine physicians are unfamiliar with  the epidemiology of this pathogen. it is spread via person-to-person contact and  is harbored within the anterior nares and on the skin of carriers. outbreaks of community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus soft tissue infection are not treated by traditional beta-lactam antibiotics, and they can be difficult to eradicate. such infections have been associated with significant morbidity, with up to 70% of involved team members requiring hospitalization and  intravenous antibiotics. a thorough understanding of community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus is essential for the sports medicine  physician to properly identify, treat, and control infectious outbreaks.

TI  == treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin infections in the pediatric and adolescent patient populations.
AB  == before 1980, superficial pyodermas in the us were caused primarily by streptococci. studies conducted in miami show that during the early 1980s, the predominant pathogen associated with impetigo in pediatric patients shifted from  streptococcus pyogenes to staphylococcus aureus. subsequent reports revealed a trend of increasing resistance of s. aureus to penicillins. by regular monitoring of local sensitivity patterns physicians are more likely to select the appropriate antibiotic. the current recommendation for the treatment of pediatric skin disease is cephalosporins due to their low likelihood of resistance by s. aureus.

TI  == update on treating uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections.
AB  == dermatologists treat a variety of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections (usssis) such as folliculitis, impetigo, erysipelas, cellulitis, furuncles, carbuncles, and non-perirectal abscesses. most usssis are caused by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. the new extended-spectrum cephalosporins (cefdinir, cefpodoxime) offer efficacy against most gram-positive  and gram-negative pathogens. despite recently published guidelines, many physicians do not prescribe cephalosporins for usssis out of concern that these agents will produce a hypersensitivity reaction in patients allergic to penicillin. although the rate of cephalosporin reaction in penicillin-allergic patients is often quoted as up to 10%, this rate does not take into account the 1% to 3% risk for allergy to cephalosporin alone and the nonspecific increased risk of penicillin-allergic patients to develop hypersensitivity to other drugs.  when these additional risks are considered, the likelihood of a reaction in known penicillin-allergic patients, especially to most third-generation and extended spectrum cephalosporins, becomes less than 1%. cephalosporins with side chains unlike those of penicillin or ampicillin side chains are less likely to result in an allergic reaction in penicillin or ampicillin-allergic patients than cephalosporins with similar side chains. although both cefdinir and cefpodoxime are considered to carry a very low risk of cross reactivity with penicillin or ampicillin, the former demonstrates better activity against s. aureus. among the  late-generation cephalosporins, cefdinir is the most potent oral agent when tested against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci, 4- to 16-fold more active than cefprozil and cephalexin, respectively.

TI  == bacteriophage therapy: a revitalized therapy against bacterial infectious diseases.
AB  == bacteriophage (phage) therapy involves using phages or their products as bioagents for the treatment or prophylaxis of bacterial infectious diseases. much evidence in support of the effectiveness of phage therapy against bacterial infectious diseases has accumulated since 1980 from animal model studies conducted in western countries. reports indicate that appropriate administration  of living phages can be used to treat lethal infectious diseases caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, vibrio vulnificus, and salmonella spp., and gram-positive bacteria, such as enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus. the phage display system and genetically modified nonreplicating phages are also effective for treatment of helicobacter pylori and p. aeruginosa, respectively. in addition to phage particles per se, purified phage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolase (lysin) is also reported to be effective for the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases caused by gram-positive bacteria such  as streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, bacillus anthracis, and group b streptococci. all phage lysins that have been studied to date exhibit immediate and strong bacteriolytic activity when applied exogenously. furthermore, phage-coded inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis (protein antibiotics), search methods for novel antibacterial agents using phage genome informatics, and vaccines utilizing phages or their products are being developed. phage therapy will compensate for unavoidable complications of chemotherapy such as the appearance of multidrug resistance or substituted microbism.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial and resistance-modifying activities of aqueous crude khat  extracts against oral microorganisms.
AB  == objectives: to assess antimicrobial activities of aqueous crude khat (catha edulis) extracts against a panel of oral microorganisms and to test their ability to modify bacterial resistance to tetracycline and penicillin in vitro. design: lyophilized aqueous extracts were prepared from three khat cultivars. the agar dilution method of the nccls was used to test the extracts, at concentrations of  20-1.25 mg/ml, against 33 oral strains. mic was defined as the lowest concentration at which there was no visible growth. slight growth was defined as  marked growth reduction (mgr). the e-test was used to determine the mics of tetracycline and penicillin-g for three resistant strains in absence and presence of a sub-mic of the khat extracts (5mg/ml). results: eighteen strains (55%) were  sensitive to the extracts (mics 5-20 mg/ml). most of these were periodontal pathogens with porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythensis being the most susceptible (mic 5-10mg/ml). veillonella parvula, actinomyces israelii and some streptococci were not sensitive. except for lactobacillus acidophilus that showed mgr at 1mg/ml, cariogenic species were neither sensitive. the extracts were active against streptococcus pyogenes (mic 10-20 mg/ml) but not against candida albicans and staphylococcus aureus. the presence of the khat extracts at  a sub-mic resulted in a 2-4-fold potentiation of the tested antibiotics against the resistant strains. conclusions: khat has water-soluble constituents possessing selective antibacterial activity against oral bacteria. there is preliminary evidence for presence of an antibiotic resistance-modifying component. further investigation is needed to identify the active components and  assess their clinical relevance.

TI  == the impact of homologous recombination on the generation of diversity in bacteria.
AB  == the imprint of demographic and selective processes on bacterial population structure needs to be evaluated as deviation from the expectations of an appropriate null neutral model. we explore the impact of varying the population mutation and recombination rates theta and rho on ideal populations, using a recently developed model of neutral drift at multiple loci. this model may be fitted to experimental data to provide estimates of these parameters, and we do so for seven bacterial species (neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, helicobacter pylori, burkholderia  pseudomallei and bacillus cereus), illustrating that bacterial species vary extensively in these fundamental parameters. historically, the influence of recombination has often been estimated through its influence on the index of association i(a). we show that this may be relatively insensitive to changes in either mutation or recombination rates. it is known that biased sampling can lead to artificially high estimates of i(a). we therefore provide a method of precisely separating the effects of such bias and true linkage between alleles. we also demonstrate that by fitting the neutral model to experimental data, more  informative and precise estimates of the relative roles of recombination and mutation may be obtained.

TI  == eradication of pathogens from the nasopharynx after therapy of acute maxillary sinusitis with low- or high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.
AB  == the growing resistance of streptococcus pneumoniae to penicillin can be overcome  by increasing the dose of the penicillin administered. this generated the recommendation that the adult dose of amoxicillin for the treatment of acute maxillary sinusitis (ams) be increased from 1.5 g/day to 4.0 g/day. the objective of this study was to investigate whether the higher dose of amoxicillin is more effective than the previously recommended dose in eradicating s. pneumoniae from  the nasopharynx of patients who present with ams. nasopharyngeal cultures obtained from 58 patients with ams were studied: 30 received amoxicillin 1.5 g/day given in divided doses three times a day for 10 days (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 4:1 formulation) and 28 were treated with amoxicillin 4.0 g/day given in divided doses twice a day for 10 days (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 16:1 formulation). seventy-one potentially pathogenic organisms were isolated: s. pneumoniae (27 isolates), haemophilus influenzae non-type b (25), moraxella catarrhalis (5), streptococcus pyogenes (5) and staphylococcus aureus (9). the number of s. pneumoniae isolates in the 1.5 g/day group was reduced from 14 to 9 (2 intermediately resistant and 3 highly resistant). in contrast, the number of s. pneumoniae isolates in the 4.0 g/day group was reduced from 13 to 2 (1 highly resistant) (p<0.05). no differences were noted in the eradication rate of other groups of isolates, which were all susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. these data illustrate the superiority of 4.0 g/day amoxicillin/clavulanic acid compared with 1.5 g/day amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in the eradication of s. pneumoniae from the nasopharynx.

AB  == the data of 1692 susceptibility tests acquired from april 2003 through march 2004 in the mastitis laboratory of the institute for food quality and safety were summarized in order to help veterinarians confronted with acute mastitis in choosing the appropriate antibiotic. two thirds of the milk samples were infected with gram-positive cocci. one third of these were identified as streptococcus (s.) uberis, one fourth as staphylococcus (s.) aureus. all isolates (100%) of s.  uberis, s. dysgalactiae, s. agalactiae and arcanobacterium pyogenes were susceptible to penicillin and ampicillin. concering s. aureus, nearly 100% of the isolates were susceptible to oxacillin, cephalothin, cefacetril, cefquinom and neomycin, but only 88% of the isolates were sensitive to penicillin, ampicillin and cefoperazon. the gram-negative rods (escherichia (e.) coli, klebsiella spp. and pseudomonas spp.) displayed an irregular resistance pattern. more than 93% of all examined isolates including pseudomonas spp. were susceptible to colistin. the sensitivity of e. coli and klebsiella spp.to marbofloxacin, enrofloxacin and  cefquinom exceeded 96%. thus, the susceptibility of gram-positive mastitis pathogens to common antibiotics is favourable. because the highly effective colistin is no longer approved for local therapy, the situation for gram-negative bacteria is more difficult.

TI  == mode of action and biochemical characterization of rep8839, a novel inhibitor of  methionyl-trna synthetase.
AB  == aminoacyl-trna synthetases have attracted interest as essential and novel targets involved in bacterial protein synthesis. rep8839 is a potent inhibitor of mets, the methionyl-trna synthetase in staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), and in streptococcus pyogenes. the biochemical activity of rep8839 was shown by specific inhibition of purified s. aureus mets (50% inhibitory concentration, <1.9 nm). target specificity was confirmed by overexpression of the mets gene in s. aureus, resulting in an eightfold increase in the mic for rep8839. macromolecular synthesis assays in the presence of rep8839 demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of protein synthesis and rna synthesis in s. pneumoniae r6, but only protein synthesis was affected in an isogenic rel mutant deficient in the stringent response. strains with reduced  susceptibility to rep8839 were generated by selection of strains with spontaneous mutations and through serial passages. point mutations within the mets gene were  mapped, leading to a total of 23 different amino acid substitutions within mets that were located around the modeled active site. the most frequent mets mutations were i57n, leading to a shift in the mic from 0.06 microg/ml to 4 microg/ml, and g54s, resulting in a mic of 32 microg/ml that was associated with  a reduced growth rate. the mutation prevention concentration was 32 microg/ml in  four s. aureus strains (methicillin-sensitive s. aureus and mrsa), which is well  below the drug concentration of 2% (20,000 microg/ml) in a topical formulation. in conclusion, we demonstrate by biochemical, physiologic, and genetic mode-of-action studies that rep8839 exerts its antibacterial activity through specific inhibition of mets, a novel target.

TI  == antibacterial activity of rep8839, a new antibiotic for topical use.
AB  == rep8839 is a novel methionyl-trna synthetase (mets) inhibitor with potent antibacterial activity against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and other clinically important gram-positive bacteria but little activity against gram-negative bacteria. all isolates of s. aureus, including strains resistant to methicillin, mupirocin, vancomycin, and linezolid  were susceptible to rep8839 at concentrations of < or =0.5 microg/ml. rep8839 was also active against staphylococcus epidermidis, including multiply resistant strains (mic, < or =0.25 microg/ml). all s. pyogenes isolates were susceptible to rep8839 at concentrations of < or =0.25 microg/ml, suggesting that mets2, a second enzyme previously identified in streptococcus pneumoniae, was not present  in this organism. rep8839 was highly bound to the protein of human serum, and activity was not greatly influenced by inoculum size but was affected by ph, exhibiting optimal antibacterial activity in a neutral medium rather than a weak  acidic medium. like mupirocin, rep8839 exhibited bacteriostatic activity against  key pathogens. the emergence of mupirocin resistance in s. aureus highlights the  need for a new topical antibiotic with the ability to inhibit high-level mupirocin-resistant strains and other emerging phenotypes, such as vancomycin-resistant and community-acquired methicillin-resistant isolates.

TI  == keratinocyte production of cathelicidin provides direct activity against bacterial skin pathogens.
AB  == immune defense at an interface with the external environment reflects the functions of physical and chemical barriers provided by epithelial and immune cells. resident epithelial cells, such as keratinocytes, produce numerous peptides with direct antimicrobial activity but also provide a physical barrier against invading pathogens and signal the recruitment of circulating immune cells, such as neutrophils. antimicrobial peptides such as cathelicidin are produced constitutively by neutrophils and are inducible in keratinocytes in response to infection. the multiplicity of antimicrobial peptides and their cellular sources has resulted in an incomplete understanding of the role of cathelicidin production by epithelial cells in cutaneous immune defense. therefore, this study sought to evaluate keratinocyte antimicrobial activity and  the potential contribution of keratinocyte cathelicidin to host protection against two leading human skin pathogens. wild-type mice and those with a targeted deletion of the cathelicidin gene, cnlp, were rendered neutropenic prior to cutaneous infection. interestingly, cnlp-deficient mice remained more susceptible to group a streptococcus infection than mice with cnlp intact, suggesting the involvement of epithelial cell-derived cathelicidin in host immune defense. keratinocytes were then isolated in culture and found to inhibit the growth of staphylococcus aureus, an effect that was partially dependent on their  ability to synthesize and activate cathelicidin. further, lentivirus-mediated delivery of activated human cathelicidin enhanced keratinocyte antimicrobial activity. combined, these data illustrate the potential contribution of keratinocyte cathelicidin to the innate immune defense of skin against bacterial  pathogens and highlight the need to consider epithelial antimicrobial function in the diagnosis and therapy of skin infection.

TI  == cloning, characterization and expression of escapin, a broadly antimicrobial fad-containing l-amino acid oxidase from ink of the sea hare aplysia californica.
AB  == a 60 kda monomeric protein isolated from the defensive purple ink secretion of the sea hare aplysia californica was cloned and sequenced, and is the first sea hare antimicrobial protein to be functionally expressed in e. coli. sequence analysis suggested that this protein is a flavin-containing l-amino acid oxidase  (laao), with one predicted potential glycosylation site, although the glycosylation could not be experimentally confirmed. this protein, which we call  ;escapin', has high sequence similarity to several other gastropod proteins. escapin was verified by nmr, mass spectroscopy and hplc to have fad as its flavin cofactor. escapin's antimicrobial effects, bacteriostasis and bactericidal, were  determined using a combination of two assays: (1) incubation of bacteria on solid media followed by assessment of inhibition by direct observation of zones of inhibition or by turbidity measurements; and (2) incubation of bacteria in liquid media followed by counting viable colonies after growing on agar plates. native escapin inhibited the growth of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including marine bacteria (vibrio harveyii and staphylococcus aureus) and pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and pseudomonas aeruginosa). escapin also inhibited the growth of yeast and fungi, with different efficacies. escapin's antimicrobial activity was concentration dependent and did not decrease when stored for more than 5 months at room temperature. escapin was bacteriostatic and not bactericidal in minimal media (e.g. salt media) with glucose, yeast extract, and a mixture of 20 amino acids each at 50 micromol l(-1), but was bactericidal in media enriched with tryptone peptone. escapin was also strongly bactericidal in media with l-lysine at concentrations as low as 3 mmol l(-1) and slightly bactericidal in 50 mmol l(-1)  l-arginine, but not in most other amino acids even at 50 mmol l(-1). escapin had  high oxidase activity (producing hydrogen peroxide) with either l-arginine or l-lysine as a substrate and little to no oxidase activity with other l-amino acids. hydrogen peroxide alone (without escapin or amino acids) was strongly bacteriostatic but poorly bactericidal, similar in this respect to l-arginine but different from l-lysine in the presence of escapin. together these results suggest that there are multiple mechanisms to escapin's antimicrobial effects, with bacteriostasis resulting largely or entirely from the effects of hydrogen peroxide produced by escapin's laao activity, but bactericidal effects resulting  from lysine-dependent mechanisms not directly involving hydrogen peroxide. recombinant escapin expressed in bacteria was also active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, suggesting that glycosylation is not essential for antimicrobial activity.

AB  == the objective of this study was to estimate the effects of clinical mastitis (cm) (both with and without specific pathogen identification) occurring in different stages of lactation on length of herd life in two new york state dairy farms. the 2,697 cows in the study were followed for one lactation (the first-occurring one  on or after 1 october 1999), until it ended because of a new lactation, culling,  or end of study (31 march 2001 in one farm; 31 july 2001 in the other). a cox proportional hazards model with time-dependent covariates, in sas((r)), was used  to measure, within a lactation, the effect of the first occurrence of cm (without specific pathogen identification) occurring 1--7, 8--66, 67--100, 101--225, or >or=226 days in milk (dim), on how long cows remained in the herd. for the first  occurrence of cm due to streptococcus spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus spp., escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., and 'no pathogen isolated', the intervals were before and after the median dim of first occurrence of each pathogen. there were too few cases due to arcanobacterium pyogenes, and 'other pathogens grouped together' to split into intervals, so they were modeled as binary variables, i.e. as they occurred. cm was modeled using time-dependent covariates, to account for its differing effects throughout lactation on culling. other variables controlled for were herd, parity, calving season, and other significant diseases. in the dataset, the lactational incidence risk of the first occurrence of cm was 18.2%; 20.0% of the cows did not survive the lactation that  was studied. the overall annual culling percentage for both herds during the study period (including all cows, whether eligible for the study or not) was 35.6%. for cows with cm without pathogen identification, their highest hazard ratio (hr) of culling occurred from 67 to 100 dim. all of the pathogens modeled markedly reduced herd life. on average over the entire lactation, cows with staphylococcus spp. cm had the highest hrs for culling, although there were no significant differences among pathogens (at p=0.0018 (reflecting 28 pairwise comparisons)). for early-occurring (before median dim of first occurrence) s. aureus cm, the daily rate of change of the hr of culling increased over time. the hrs for culling were particularly high for late-occurring (after median dim of first occurrence) e. coli and klebsiella spp. cm early in the interval, but the daily rate of change of the hazard of culling for these two pathogens decreased sharply over time. treating cm as time-dependent therefore allowed us to measure  in greater detail, its varying effects (of when it occurred) on herd life.

TI  == growth and survival of bacteria implicated in sudden infant death syndrome on cot mattress materials.
AB  == aims: to compare growth and survival of selected bacteria implicated in sudden infant death syndrome (sids) on cot mattress polyurethane (pu) inner-foams and on different types of cot mattress cover materials. methods and results: escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes were inoculated onto swatches of new-unused cot mattress pu inner-foam and onto three types of cot mattress covers (polyvinyl chloride, cotton and polyester). the influence of inoculation cell density, relative humidity (rh) and temperature of incubation on survival was assessed by recovery of cells in 0.85% nacl, with viable cell enumeration by plate counting on selective and differential media. utilization of carbon and nitrogen sources within cot mattress pu was assessed by following growth on aqueous leachate from pu, and by colorimetric determination of aromatic amines. good survival capability (>206 d) was shown by all three test species on  pu inner-foam and on polyester mattress cover at high rh (75%), but only by staph. aureus on pu at low rh (25%). aqueous soluble material from pu foam supports bacterial growth; removal of aromatic amines from aqueous leachate from  pu accompanies growth of staph. aureus. conclusions: staphylococcus aureus has good survival capability on cot mattress pu foam, even at low rh. soluble material within pu can serve as carbon and nitrogen sources for bacterial growth. significance and impact of the study: prolonged survival of staph. aureus on pu at low rh could explain, in the context of the common bacterial toxins hypothesis, an increased risk of sids associated with used infant mattresses.

TI  == bacterial aetiology of acute osteoarticular infections in children.
AB  == aim: to study the bacterial aetiology of acute osteoarticular infections in children and to analyse the efficiency of culture methods. methods: bacteriological data of 407 cases of clinically suspected osteoarticular infections affecting 406 children hospitalized in an orthopaedic surgery department between 1999 and 2002 were retrospectively reviewed. results: bacterial cultures from clinical specimens were positive in 74 cases (18%): 38 cases of septic arthritis and 36 cases of bone infections (osteitis, osteomyelitis or osteoarthritis). the use of liquid medium bottles to grow bacteria from articular fluids increased the rate of positive cultures compared to the use of standard solid media (p = 0.0001). the most commonly recovered pathogen was staphylococcus aureus (44%) followed by kingella kingae (14%), streptococcus pyogenes (10%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (10%). k. kingae was most frequently isolated among children under 36 mo of age (p = 0.0003), whereas  s. aureus was most frequently isolated among children over 36 mo (p = 0.0015). conclusion: by improving our culture method, we observed a recrudescence of isolation of k. kingae, but s. aureus remains the main pathogen isolated from osteoarticular infections in children. this finding is useful for the adaptation  of a probabilistic antibiotic treatment of these infections.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in community-acquired pulmonary pathogens.
AB  == among infectious diseases, pneumonia is still the ;;captain of the men of death.'' etiologic diagnosis is often unreliable; consequently, clinicians must know epidemiology of community-acquired pneumonia for optimizing empiric antibiotic therapy. in recent years, all major pulmonary pathogens have become more and more resistant to conventional antibiotics. penicillin-resistant and even multiresistant pneumococci have spread worldwide, but primarily in the united states, some european countries, south africa, and the far east. a similar trend is evidenced by ampicillin-resistant hemophilus influenzae, whereas moraxella catarrhalis almost invariably produces beta-lactamases. the widening of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus from hospitals to the community may be the new reality of the 1990s. increasing erythromycin resistance of streptococcus pyogenes requires beta-lactam therapy. the spread of both cromosomally and plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases makes treatment of infections caused by gram-negative enterobacilli more difficult. bacterial resistance creates a challenge for clinicians from the viewpoint of correct and successful management of patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline against isolates from patients enrolled in phase 3 clinical trials of treatment for complicated skin and skin-structure infections and complicated intra-abdominal infections.
AB  == the in vitro activity of tigecycline was evaluated against 4913 baseline pathogens isolated from 1986 patients enrolled in 4 pivotal phase 3 clinical trials. the trials, which were conducted in 38 countries worldwide, involved patients with complicated skin and skin-structure infections or complicated intra-abdominal infections. tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens for each infection type, including gram-positive and gram-negative strains of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria (mics, < or =2 microg/ml for most  pathogens). the spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant s. aureus), streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and bacteroides  fragilis. a few genera, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and members of the tribe proteeae, were generally less susceptible to tigecycline than were other gram-negative pathogens. the susceptibility of the pathogens to tigecycline was similar for isolates obtained from patients enrolled in the studies of complicated skin and skin-structure infection or of complicated intra-abdominal infection. for most pathogens, the susceptibility to tigecycline was similar across all geographic regions. the excellent expanded broad-spectrum activity of  tigecycline demonstrated in vitro against clinical isolates confirmed its potential utility for pathogens associated with complicated skin and skin-structure infections or complicated intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in bulgaria--a synopsis from bulstar 2003.
AB  == we introduce bulgarian surveillance tracking antimicrobial resistance (bulstar) and make the first report on surveillance data for 2003. this longitudinal surveillance programme monitors the isolation and antimicrobial susceptibility of all clinically significant microorganisms isolated from blood cultures, cerebrospinal fluid, upper and lower respiratory tract, urine and wound samples in the participating microbiology laboratories. twenty eight public, 45 hospital  and 6 private laboratories from all 28 counties of the republic of bulgaria participated in bulstar 2003. the total number of isolates from monitored sources during the surveillance period was 98 929. seven microorganisms represented 72% of all isolated bacteria in bulstar 2003: escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, proteus-providencia-morganella group, klebsiella spp., pseudomonas spp, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. generally the resistance of  clinically significant gram positive and gram negative bacteria in bulgaria was estimated to be at a medium level when compared with many other surveillance sources worldwide. a unique 32-year experiment on the population by treating all  severe infections with an ampicillin/gentamicin combination resulted in twofold higher levels of resistance to amynoglycosides compared with other countries worldwide. this is due to the extremely conservative treatment schemes used in the former socialist countries, based on national directives and cheap domestic production of gentamicin and ampicillin. the forthcoming introduction of a computer network and improvements in detecting mistakes are expected to increase  the sensitivity and the significance of bulstar surveillance system - an indispensable tool in the combat against increasing worldwide antibiotic resistance.

TI  == establishment of a superficial skin infection model in mice by using staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == a new animal model for the purpose of studying superficial infections is presented. in this model an infection is established by disruption of the skin barrier by partial removal of the epidermal layer by tape stripping and subsequent application of the pathogens staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. the infection and the infection route are purely topical, in contrast to those used in previously described animal models in mice, such as the skin suture-wound model, where the infection is introduced into the deeper layers of the skin. thus, the present model is considered more biologically relevant for the study of superficial skin infections in mice and humans. established topical  antibiotic treatments are shown to be effective. the procedures involved in the model are simple, a feature that increases throughput and reproducibility. this new model should be applicable to the evaluation of novel antimicrobial treatments of superficial infections caused by s. aureus and s. pyogenes.

TI  == [hospitalizations for varicella in the hospital infantil la fe, valencia,spain, 2001-2004].
AB  == introduction: varicella is a common, highly contagious disease. it is usually benign but has potentially serious complications. patients and methods: to assess the clinical characteristics and the associated cost of varicella hospitalization, we reviewed the medical records of children hospitalized for varicella between 2001 and 2004. children with coincidental varicella hospitalized for a different reason were excluded. results: of 1177 children with varicella attended at the emergency room, 101 (8.6 %) were hospitalized. the median age was 3.2 years (21 days to 18.9 years). twenty-eight children had underlying disease. thirty-seven children had no complications and the reason for admission was: a) risk of severe varicella (21 immunocompromised children, three  neonates), and b) high fever or observation (13 cases). the 64 remaining children were admitted for 66 complications of varicella. the most common complications were skin/soft tissue infections (33 patients) and the leading cause was streptococcus pyogenes (n = 13) and staphylococcus aureus (n = 10) isolated in blood or the site of infection. other complications were pneumonia (13 children), neurological (febrile seizures in nine, meningoencephalitis in two, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in one, cerebellitis in one), hematological (neutropenia in one, henoch-schonlein purpura in one and thrombopenic purpura in  three) and osteoarticular (synovitis in one and septic arthritis in one). one patient died of multiorgan failure. during the study period, the rate of emergency room visits due to varicella doubled and the number of admissions for complications tripled. the mean length of hospital stay was 6.8 days (range: 1-28 days) and the total associated cost was 397,314.14 euro, excluding symptomatic treatment. conclusions: the high morbidity associated with varicella and its complications, as well as the high social costs of this disease, support the implementation of routine varicella vaccination. this could reduce the total number of cases, their severity, direct costs, generated by medical care, and indirect costs, generated by the disease and hospitalization.

TI  == a toll-like receptor 2-responsive lipid effector pathway protects mammals against skin infections with gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == flake (flk), an n-ethyl-n-nitrosourea-induced recessive germ line mutation of c57bl/6 mice, impairs the clearance of skin infections by streptococcus pyogenes  and staphylococcus aureus, gram-positive pathogens that elicit innate immune responses by activating toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2). positional cloning and sequencing revealed that flk is a novel allele of the stearoyl coenzyme a desaturase 1 gene (scd1). flake homozygotes show reduced sebum production and are unable to synthesize the monounsaturated fatty acids (mufa) palmitoleate (c(16:1)) and oleate (c(18:1)), both of which are bactericidal against gram-positive (but not gram-negative) organisms in vitro. however, intradermal mufa administration to s. aureus-infected mice partially rescues the flake phenotype, which indicates that an additional component of the sebum may be required to improve bacterial clearance. in normal mice, transcription of scd1-a  gene with numerous nf-kappab elements in its promoter--is strongly and specifically induced by tlr2 signaling. similarly, the scd1 gene is induced by tlr2 signaling in a human sebocyte cell line. these observations reveal the existence of a regulated, lipid-based antimicrobial effector pathway in mammals and suggest new approaches to the treatment or prevention of infections with gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimers: novel sequence-selective, dna-interactive, cross-linking agents with activity against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == objectives: pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine (pbd) dimers are synthetic sequence-selective interstrand dna minor-groove cross-linking agents developed from anthramycins. we investigated the antibacterial activity of three dimers, sjg-136, drg-16 and elb-21, which differ in the structure of the pbd monomeric unit and the length of the linker region between the two identical pbd monomers.  methods: mics were determined against 38 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), 20 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre), 12 isolates of streptococcus pyogenes, 12 of streptococcus agalactiae, 12 of listeria monocytogenes and 24 gram-negative clinical isolates. binding to double-stranded  dna was assessed by determination of the dna melting temperature (t(m)). results: mic(90) values for sjg-136 were 0.5 mg/l against mrsa, vre and l. monocytogenes,  0.06 mg/l against s. pyogenes and 0.03 mg/l against s. agalactiae; these were below the maximum tolerated dose of the drug. mic(90)s for drg-16 were 0.125, >0.5, 0.125, 0.015 and <0.008 mg/l, respectively. the most potent compound was elb-21, with corresponding mic(90) values of 0.03, 0.06, 0.06, 0.015 and 0.015 mg/l. there was little or no variation in sensitivity amongst isolates from any one species. all gram-negative species (acinetobacter, pseudomonas, klebsiella, proteus spp.) were not susceptible due to the barrier function of the outer membrane. pbd dimers showed bactericidal activity against mrsa and vre and there  was a significant post-antibiotic effect (1.5--3.5 h). incubation of emrsa-16 genomic dna (50 microm) with 20 microm elb-21 resulted in a large increase in t(m) suggesting that pbd dimers exert their antibacterial effect by cross-linking of the two dna strands. conclusions: these data indicate that this novel class of antibacterial agents warrants further investigation as potential antibiotics for  the treatment of severe infections caused by gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == pulmonary infections in swine induce altered porcine surfactant protein d expression and localization to dendritic cells in bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue.
AB  == surfactant protein d (sp-d) is a pattern-recognition molecule of the innate immune system that recognizes various microbial surface-specific carbohydrate and lipid patterns. in vitro data has suggested that this binding may lead to increased microbial association with macrophages and dendritic cells. the aim of  the present in vivo study was to study the expression of porcine sp-d (psp-d) in  the lung during different pulmonary bacterial infections, and the effect of the routes of infection on this expression was elucidated. furthermore, the aim was to study the in vivo spatial relationship among psp-d, pathogens, phagocytic cells and dendritic cells. lung tissue was collected from experimental and natural bronchopneumonias caused by actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae or staphylococcus aureus, and from embolic and diffuse interstitial pneumonia, caused by staph. aureus or arcanobacterium pyogenes and streptococcus suis serotype 2, respectively. by comparing normal and diseased lung tissue from the same lungs, increased diffuse psp-d immunoreactivity was seen in the surfactant in both acute and chronic bronchopneumonias, while such increased expression of psp-d was generally not present in the interstitial pneumonias. co-localization of psp-d, alveolar macrophages and bacteria was demonstrated, and psp-d showed a  patchy distribution on the membranes of alveolar macrophages. sp-d immunoreactivity was intracellular in dendritic cells. the dendritic cells were identified by their morphology, the absence of macrophage marker immunoreactivity and the presence of dendritic cell marker immunoreactivity. increased expression  of psp-d in the surfactant coincided with presence of psp-d-positive dendritic cells in bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (balt), indicating a possible transport of psp-d through the specialized m cells overlying (balt). in conclusion, we have shown that psp-d expression in the lung surfactant is induced by bacterial infection by an aerogenous route rather than by a haematogenous route, and that the protein interacts specifically with alveolar macrophages and  with dendritic cells in microbial-induced balt. the function of the interaction between psp-d and dendritic cells in balt remain unclear, but psp-d could represent a link between the innate and adaptive immune system, facilitating the  bacterial antigen presentation by dendritic cells in balt.

TI  == staphylococcus aureus golden pigment impairs neutrophil killing and promotes virulence through its antioxidant activity.
AB  == golden color imparted by carotenoid pigments is the eponymous feature of the human pathogen staphylococcus aureus. here we demonstrate a role of this hallmark phenotype in virulence. compared with the wild-type (wt) bacterium, a s. aureus mutant with disrupted carotenoid biosynthesis is more susceptible to oxidant killing, has impaired neutrophil survival, and is less pathogenic in a mouse subcutaneous abscess model. the survival advantage of wt s. aureus over the carotenoid-deficient mutant is lost upon inhibition of neutrophil oxidative burst or in human or murine nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase-deficient hosts. conversely, heterologous expression of the s. aureus carotenoid in the nonpigmented streptococcus pyogenes confers enhanced oxidant and neutrophil resistance and increased animal virulence. blocking s. aureus carotenogenesis increases oxidant sensitivity and decreases whole-blood survival, suggesting a novel target for antibiotic therapy.

AB  == bacterial superantigens are one of the major virulence factors produced by streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus. the two novel superantigen encoding genes seem and seel were described for s. equi subsp. equi which is known as the causative agent of strangles in equids. in the present study previously characterized s. equi subsp. equi strains and strains of various other animal pathogenic streptococcal species and subspecies were investigated for the  presence of the superantigen encoding genes seem and seel by polymerase chain reaction. according to these studies seel and seem appeared to be a constant characteristic of all investigated s. equi subsp. equi strains. surprisingly, one s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus strain (s.z. 122) was also positive for both genes.  the species identity of this s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus strain could additionally be confirmed by sequencing the 16s rrna gene and the 16s-23s rdna intergenic spacer region. the superantigen encoding genes could not be found among additionally investigated s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus strains or among strains of seven other streptococcal species. the seel and seem genes of the s. equi subsp. equi strain s.e. cf32 and the genes szel and szem of the s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus strain s.z. 122 were cloned and sequenced. a sequence comparison revealed a high degree of sequence homology between seel, szel, spel and seem, szem and spem, respectively. the superantigenic toxins l and m seemed to be widely distributed virulence factors of s. equi subsp. equi, rare among s.  equi subsp. zooepidemicus but did not occur among a number of other animal pathogenic streptococcal species.

TI  == recognizing the pseudogenes in bacterial genomes.
AB  == pseudogenes are now known to be a regular feature of bacterial genomes and are found in particularly high numbers within the genomes of recently emerged bacterial pathogens. as most pseudogenes are recognized by sequence alignments, we use newly available genomic sequences to identify the pseudogenes in 11 genomes from 4 bacterial genera, each of which contains at least 1 human pathogen. the numbers of pseudogenes range from 27 in staphylococcus aureus mw2 to 337 in yersinia pestis co92 (e.g. 1-8% of the annotated genes in the genome).  most pseudogenes are formed by small frameshifting indels, but because stop codons are a + t-rich, the two low-g + c gram-positive taxa (streptococcus and staphylococcus) have relatively high fractions of pseudogenes generated by nonsense mutations when compared with more g + c-rich genomes. over half of the pseudogenes are produced from genes whose original functions were annotated as 'hypothetical' or 'unknown'; however, several broadly distributed genes involved  in nucleotide processing, repair or replication have become pseudogenes in one of the sequenced vibrio vulnificus genomes. although many of our comparisons involved closely related strains with broadly overlapping gene inventories, each  genome contains a largely unique set of pseudogenes, suggesting that pseudogenes  are formed and eliminated relatively rapidly from most bacterial genomes.

AB  == silkworms are killed by injection of pathogenic bacteria, such as staphylococcus  aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, into the haemolymph. gene disruption mutants of s. aureus whose open reading frames were previously uncharacterized and that are conserved among bacteria were examined for their virulence in silkworms. of these 100 genes, three genes named cvfa, cvfb, and cvfc were required for full virulence of s. aureus in silkworms. haemolysin production was decreased in these mutants. the cvfa and cvfc mutants also had attenuated virulence in mice. s. pyogenes cvfa-disrupted mutants produced less exotoxin and had attenuated virulence in both silkworms and mice. these results indicate that the silkworm-infection model is useful for identifying bacterial virulence genes.

TI  == [in vitro susceptibilites to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 11,475 clinical isolates obtained from 52 centers in 2002].
AB  == the susceptibilities of bacteria to fluoroquinolones (fqs), especially levofloxacin, and other antimicrobial agents were investigated using 11,475 clinical isolates collected in japan during 2002. methicillin susceptible staphylococci, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, the family of enterobactericeae, haemophilus influenzae and acinetobacter spp. exhibited stable and high susceptibilities to fqs. the rate of fqs-resistant mrsa was 80 approximately 90%, being markedly higher than that of fqs-resistant mssa. the fqs-resistance rate of mrcns was also higher than that of mscns, however, it was lower than that of mrsa. no fqs-resistant clinical isolates of salmonella spp. were detected in any of the surveys. thirteen of escherichai coli 696 isolates, 8 of klebsiella pneumoniae 630 isolates and 33 of  proteus mirabilis 373 isolates produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl),  furthermore 6 of 13 in e. coli, 1 of 8 in k. pneumoniae and 14 of 31 esbl-producing isolates, and in p. mirabilis were fqs resistant. attention should be focused in the future on the emergence of esbl in relation to fqs resistance.  the rate of fqs-resistant p. aeruginosa isolated from urinary tract infection (uti) was 40 approximately 60%, while 15 approximately 25% of isolates from respiratory tract infection (rti) were resistant. imp-1 type metallo beta-lactamase producing organisms were found in 49 of p. aeruginosa 1,095 isolates, 7 of s. marcescens 586 isolates and 4 of acinetobacter spp. 474 isolates, respectively. glycopeptide-resistant enterococci or s. aureus was not found.

TI  == human defensins.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides are small, cationic, amphiphilic peptides of 12-50 amino acids with microbicidal activity against both bacteria and fungi. the eukaryotic  antimicrobial peptides may be divided into four distinct groups according to their structural features: cysteine-free alpha-helices, extended cysteine-free alpha-helices with a predominance of one or two amino acids, loop structures with one intramolecular disulfide bond, and beta-sheet structures which are stabilised by two or three intramolecular disulfide bonds. mammalian defensins are part of the last-mentioned group. the mammalian defensins can be subdivided into three main classes according to their structural differences: the alpha-defensins, beta-defensins and the recently described theta-defensins. mammalian alpha-defensins are predominantly found in neutrophils and in small intestinal paneth cells, whereas mammalian beta-defensins have been isolated from both leukocytes and epithelial cells. recently, two novel human beta-defensins, human  beta-defensin-3 (hbd-3), and human beta-defensin-4 (hbd-4) have been discovered.  similar to hbd-1 and hbd-2, hbd-3 has microbicidal activity towards the gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli) and the yeasts  candida albicans and malassezia furfur. in addition, hbd-3 kills gram-positive bacteria such as streptococcus pyogenes or staphylococcus aureus, including multi-resistant s. aureus strains, and even vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. in contrast to hbd-1 and hbd-2, significant expression of hbd-3 has been demonstrated in non-epithelial tissues, such as leukocytes, heart and skeletal muscle. hbd-4 is expressed in certain epithelia and in neutrophils. its bactericidal activity against p. aeruginosa is stronger than that of the other known beta-defensins. here we present an overview of human antimicrobial peptides with some emphasis on their antifungal properties.

TI  == generation of transposon insertion mutant libraries for gram-positive bacteria by electroporation of phage mu dna transposition complexes.
AB  == transposon mutagenesis is a powerful technique for generating collections of insertion mutants for genetic studies. this paper describes how phage mu dna transposition complexes, transpososomes, can be exploited for gene delivery to efficiently introduce selectable markers to genomes of gram-positive bacteria. mu transpososomes were assembled in vitro with custom-designed mini-mu transposons,  concentrated, and electroporated into cells of three gram-positive bacterial species: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus suis. within cells, the complexes reproduced an authentic dna transposition reaction and integrated the delivered transposons into the bacterial genomes, yielding single-copy insertions. the integration efficiency among different species and strains of gram-positive bacteria ranged from 1x10(1) to 2x10(4) c.f.u. (mug introduced transposon dna)(-1). the strategy should be applicable to a variety of other gram-positive species after initial optimization of certain key factors affecting transposon delivery, such as the preparation method of competent cells  and physical parameters of electroporation. this study extends the scope of the mu transpososome delivery-based genomic dna integration strategy to gram-positive bacteria. thus, a straightforward generation of sizeable mutant banks is feasible for these bacteria, potentiating several types of genomic-level approaches for studies of a variety of important bacterial processes, such as pathogenicity.

TI  == toxic shock syndrome in children: epidemiology, pathogenesis, and management.
AB  == toxic shock syndrome (tss) is an acute, toxin-mediated illness, like endotoxic shock, and is characterized by fever, rash, hypotension, multiorgan involvement,  and desquamation. tss reflects the most severe form of the disease caused by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. a case definition for staphylococcal tss was well established in the early 1980s and helped in defining the epidemiology. since the late 1980s, a resurgence of highly invasive streptococcal infections, including a toxic shock-like syndrome, was noted worldwide and a consensus case definition for streptococcal tss was subsequently  proposed in 1993. both tss and the toxic shock-like syndrome occur at a lower incidence in children than in adults. changes in the manufacturing and use of tampons led to a decline in staphylococcal tss over the past decade, while the incidence of nonmenstrual staphylococcal tss increased. nonmenstrual tss and menstrual tss are now reported with almost equal frequency. the incidence of streptococcal tss remains constant after its resurgence, but varies with geographic location. streptococcal tss occurs most commonly following varicella or during the use of nsaids. sites of infection in streptococcal tss are much deeper than in staphylococcal tss, such as infection caused by blunt trauma, and  necrotizing fasciitis. bacteremia is more common in streptococcal tss than in staphylococcal tss. mortality associated with streptococcal tss is 5-10% in children, much lower than in adults (30-80%), and is 3-5% for staphylococcal tss  in children.tss is thought to be a superantigen-mediated disease. toxins produced by staphylococci and streptococci act as superantigens that can activate the immune system by bypassing the usual antigen-mediated immune-response sequence. the host-pathogen interaction, virulence factors, and the absence or presence of  host immunity determines the epidemiology, clinical syndrome, and outcome. early  recognition of this disease is important, because the clinical course is fulminant and the outcome depends on the prompt institution of therapy. management of a child with tss includes hemodynamic stabilization and appropriate antimicrobial therapy to eradicate the bacteria. supportive therapy, aggressive fluid resuscitation, and vasopressors remain the main elements. an adjuvant therapeutic strategy may include agents that can block superantigens, such as intravenous immunoglobulin that contains superantigen neutralizing antibodies.

TI  == intrinsic reduced susceptibility of serotype 6 streptococcus pyogenes to fluoroquinolone antibiotics.
AB  == background: fluoroquinolone resistance is common in staphylococcus aureus, is increasing in streptococcus pneumoniae, and is reported in streptococcus pyogenes. methods: we surveyed 384 clinical isolates of s. pyogenes, isolated during 2002-2003, for susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. we performed nucleotide sequencing of the parc and gyra genes and determined the m/emm type for selected  isolates. additionally, we analyzed m/emm type 6 s. pyogenes isolated during 1918-2003 from diverse locations. results: of the survey isolates, 10.9% had reduced zones of inhibition to ciprofloxacin in the disk-diffusion test and had elevated minimum inhibitory concentrations to other fluoroquinolones, compared with those of fully susceptible isolates. of the resistant isolates, 90.5% were m/emm type 6, and all sequenced m/emm type 6 isolates contained a serine-to-alanine substitution at position 79 in parc. strikingly, the same findings were also present in macrolide-resistant isolates from a recent outbreak of s. pyogenes infection in pittsburgh and in the lancefield reference strain of  m type 6, which was isolated in 1918, decades before the development of fluoroquinolone antibiotics. conclusion: m/emm type 6 s. pyogenes has intrinsic reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones, as a result of a polymorphism in parc. this finding was also demonstrated in erythromycin-resistant m/emm type 6 s. pyogenes, which raises concern for the emergence of multidrug-resistant s. pyogenes.

TI  == chlorine covers on living bacteria: the initial step in antimicrobial action of active chlorine compounds.
AB  == objectives: although active chlorine compounds are well-known antimicrobial agents in human medicine, their initial steps of action have not been completely  clarified. using n-chlorotaurine (nct), an endogenous mild representative, we observed persisting oxidation capacity affixed to bacteria. it was the aim of this study to investigate this 'chlorine cover'. methods: pathogens were incubated in nct, which was subsequently washed off. the oxidation capacity on the bacterial surface was measured photometrically. results: superficial chlorination in the form of covalent n-cl bonds to staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans could be attached before killing took place. for s. aureus, 3 min incubation with nct produced a cover of  3.3 x 10(-16) mol cl(+)/cfu, while the cfu count was reduced by only 26%. the kind of microorganism, coating time, ph, buffer system and, basically, the chlorine compound, influenced the cover strength. the relative cover strength on  s. aureus by nct, chloramine t, sodium dichloro-isocyanurate or n,n-dichlorotaurine was 1:15.7:38.7:0.24. chlorine covers were surprisingly stable and could be detected for 3 h at 20 degrees c (>8 h at 1 degrees c), even  without a reduction of cfu. however, addition of 5% ammonium chloride caused a rapid loss of viability, explained by formation of highly bactericidal nh(2)cl, an effect that resembles the ignition of a time-bomb. conclusions: the chlorine cover can be regarded as the first sign of interaction between chlorinating agent and microorganism, and may explain the non-lethal features of postantibiotic effect and attenuation of bacterial virulence. furthermore, it may be a decisive  step in bacterial inactivation by the myeloperoxidase-hypochlorite system in innate immunity.

TI  == augmentation of the bactericidal activities of human cathelicidin cap18/ll-37-derived antimicrobial peptides by amino acid substitutions.
AB  == objective: mammalian myeloid and epithelial cells express various peptide antibiotics (such as defensins and cathelicidins) that contribute to the innate host defense against invading micro-organisms. among these, human cathelicidin cap18/ll-37 (l1-s37) possesses potent antibacterial activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. in this study, to develop peptide derivatives with improved bactericidal actions, we utilized the amphipathic 18-mer peptide (k15-v32) of ll-37 as a template, and evaluated the activities of  modified peptides. methods: antibacterial activities of the peptides (0.022 approximately 4.4 microm corresponding to 0.1 approximately 10 microg/ml) were assessed by alamarblue assay using staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa as target organisms. furthermore, the membrane-permeabilization activities of the peptides were examined by using e. coli ml-35p as a target. results: by substituting e16 and k25 with two l residues, the hydrophobicity of the peptide (18-mer ll) was increased, and by further substituting q22, d26 and n30 with three k residues, the cationicity of the peptide (18-mer llkkk) was enhanced. among peptide derivatives, 18-mer llkkk exhibited the most potent antibacterial actions against s. aureus (methicillin-resistant and -sensitive), s. pneumoniae,  s. pyogenes, e. coli and p. aeruginosa, and possessed the most powerful membrane-permeabilizing activities against e. coli ml-35p at the effective concentrations (p <0.05, 18-mer llkkk vs. 18-mer ll, 18-mer k15-v32 and ll-37). conclusions: bactericidal activities of the amphipathic human cap18/ll-37-derived 18-mer peptide can be augmented by modifying its hydrophobicity and cationicity,  and 18-mer llkkk is the most potent among peptide derivatives with therapeutic potential for gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections.

TI  == borrelia burgdorferi binds fibronectin through a tandem beta-zipper, a common mechanism of fibronectin binding in staphylococci, streptococci, and spirochetes.
AB  == bbk32 is a fibronectin-binding protein from the lyme disease-causing spirochete borrelia burgdorferi. in this study, we show that bbk32 shares sequence similarity with fibronectin module-binding motifs previously identified in proteins from streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus. nuclear magnetic  resonance spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry are used to confirm the binding sites of bbk32 peptides within the n-terminal domain of fibronectin and to measure the affinities of the interactions. comparison of chemical shift perturbations in fibronectin f1 modules on binding of peptides from bbk32, fnbpa  from s. aureus, and sfbi from s. pyogenes provides further evidence for a shared  mechanism of binding. despite the different locations of the bacterial attachment sites in bbk32 compared with sfbi from s. pyogenes and fnbpa from s. aureus, an antiparallel orientation is observed for binding of the n-terminal domain of fibronectin to each of the pathogens. thus, these phylogenetically and morphologically distinct bacterial pathogens have similar mechanisms for binding  to human fibronectin.

TI  == conserved interactions in the staphylococcus aureus dna polc chromosome replication machine.
AB  == the polc holoenzyme replicase of the gram-positive staphylococcus aureus pathogen has been reconstituted from pure subunits. we compared individual s. aureus replicase subunits with subunits from the gram-negative escherichia coli polymerase iii holoenzyme for activity and interchangeability. the central organizing subunit, tau, is smaller than its gram-negative homolog, yet retains the ability to bind single-stranded dna and contains dna-stimulated atpase activity comparable with e. coli tau. s. aureus tau also stimulates polc, although they do not form as stabile a complex as e. coli polymerase iii.tau. we  demonstrate that the extreme c-terminal residues of polc bind to and function with beta clamps from different bacteria. hence, this polymerase-clamp interaction is highly conserved. additionally, the s. aureus delta wrench of the  clamp loader binds to e. coli beta. the s. aureus clamp loader is even capable of loading e. coli and streptococcus pyogenes beta clamps onto dna. interestingly, s. aureus polc lacks functionality with heterologous beta clamps when they are loaded onto dna by the s. aureus clamp loader, suggesting that the s. aureus clamp loader may have difficulty ejecting from heterologous clamps. nevertheless, these overall findings underscore the conservation in structure and function of gram-positive and gram-negative replicases despite >1 billion years of evolutionary distance between them.

AB  == background: skin and soft tissue infections remain among the most frequently encountered infections in surgery, and their severity ranges from mild cellulitis to severe, necrotizing infections with high incidences of morbidity and mortality. most commonly, these disorders result from skin lesions in a susceptible host, but sometimes develop following hematogenous spread from a previously unknown focus. methods: the current literature was reviewed to provide an up-to-date summary of the microbiology, diagnosis, pathogenesis, and therapy of complicated skin and soft tissue infections. special conditions are also described, such as cellulitis, bite wounds and diabetic foot infections. the potential roles of several new drugs that have become available recently, or are  currently in phase iii clinical trials, are discussed. results: the causative pathogens are mostly gram-positive cocci from a patient's endogenous skin flora,  but complicated infections often involve gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria related to the site and source of infection. classifications are numerous and often confusing, occasionally leading to a prolonged diagnostic workup. therapy should be initiated immediately following clinical diagnosis, including empiric antimicrobial chemotherapy and surgical debridement, if necessary. hospitalization is mandatory for those patients with constitutional symptoms of sepsis, failed outpatient therapy, or deeper infections, such as necrotizing fasciitis. the number and variety of resistant organisms in the community continues to increase steadily, with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  (mrsa) currently the most common. several new drugs that are active against mrsa  are becoming available, and include those active broadly against gram-positive cocci, such as quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, and daptomycin. tigecycline, a new antibiotic of the glycylcycline class, has extended broad-spectrum activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including anaerobes and multi-resistant organisms. conclusions: new, promising agents, with activity against multi-drug resistant gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, are aimed at filling the gap in the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections.

AB  == orbital cellulitis is rare. however the high risk of severe ocular and neurological complications make early diagnosis and adequate therapy essential. the purpose of this retrospective study is to describe 33 cases observed in the pediatric infectious disease department of the casablanca children's hospital in  morocco from 1994 to 2000. orbital cellulitis was preseptal in 24 patients and retroseptal in 9. infection occurred in relation with sinusitis in 10 cases, polydermitis in 8, wound infection in 6, ocular infection in 2, and dental abscess in 2. ages ranged from 40 days to 15 years with a mean age of 5 years. infants accounted for 25% of cases and always presented preseptal cellulitis. fever and local edema were noted in all patients. exophthalmia occurred in six patients and seizures in 2. the 9 cases of retroseptal cellulitis were complicated by empyema in 2 cases, meningitis in 1 case and thrombophlebitis of cavernous sinus with cerebromalacia in 1 case. bacteriological testing identified micro-organisms in 10 cases, i.e., staphylococcus aureus in 6 cases, streptococcus b in 1, streptococcus pyogenes in 1, enterobacter cloacae in land acinitobacter jejuni in 1 case. therapy was based on broad-spectrum antibiotics in association with surgery in the patient presenting in intracranial abscess. ophthalmoplegia-like sequels including blindness, aphasia, and motor deficit occurred in 2 patients. orbital cellulitis in children are usually preseptal and  have a favorable prognosis. however prompt and adequate antibiotherapy is essential due to the risk of retroseptal involvement with inflammatory palpberal  edema and possible cerebral extension.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in the nasopharyngeal flora of children with acute otitis media and otitis media recurring after amoxicillin therapy.
AB  == the objective of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility of the organisms isolated from the nasopharynx of children who presented with acute otitis media (aom) or otitis media that recurred after amoxicillin therapy. nasopharyngeal cultures obtained from 72 patients, 40 with aom and 32 with recurrent otitis media (rom), were analysed. thirty-six potentially pathogenic organisms were recovered in 34 (85 %) of the children from the aom group, and 42  were isolated from 29 (91 %) of the children from the rom group. the organisms isolated were streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 26), haemophilus influenzae non-type  b (n = 22), moraxella catarrhalis (n = 13), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 8) and staphylococcus aureus (n = 9). resistance to the eight antimicrobial agents used  was found in 37 instances in the aom group as compared to 99 instances in the rom group (p < 0.005). the difference between aom and rom was significant with streptococcus pneumoniae resistance to amoxicillin (p < 0.005), to amoxicillin/clavulanate (p < 0.005), to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (p < 0.01), to cefixime (p < 0.01) and to azithromycin (p < 0.01), and for h. influenzae resistance to amoxicillin (p < 0.025). these data illustrate the higher recovery  rate of antimicrobial-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and h. influenzae from the nasopharynx of children who had otitis media that recurred after amoxicillin  therapy than those with aom.

TI  == hepatoprotective and antibacterial effects of extracts from trichilia emetica vahl. (meliaceae).
AB  == trichilia emetica vahl. (meliaceae) is a tree widely distributed in tropical africa. it has been used in mali folk medicine for the treatment of various illnesses. the aim of this work was to study the hepatoprotective and antibacterial effects of a crude aqueous extract from trichilia emetica root. an  ethyl ether fraction from the aqueous extract was also prepared and studied. we have examined the hepatoprotective activity of the extracts on ccl4-induced damage in rat hepatocytes, their toxicity using the brine shrimp bioassay and their antibacterial activity against clinical isolated bacterial strains, which are commonly responsible for respiratory infections. a preliminary phytochemical  analysis showed a high polyphenolic content in the aqueous extract and the presence of limonoids in the ethyl ether fraction. these latter compounds may be  considered responsible for the good activity against the bacterial strains tested. trichilia emetica extracts exerted also a significant (p<0.05) hepatoprotective effect at a dose of 1000 microg/ml both on plasma membrane and mitochondrial function as compared to silymarin used as a positive control. these activities may be a result of the presence of either polyphenols or limonoids. finally, both the aqueous extract and its ethyl ether fraction did not show toxicity (lc50>1000 microg/ml) in the brine shrimp bioassay.

TI  == microbiology and management of peritonsillar, retropharyngeal, and parapharyngeal abscesses.
AB  == this review describes the microbiology, diagnosis, and management of peritonsillar, retropharyngeal, and parapharyngeal abscesses in children. predominant anaerobic organisms isolated in peritonsillar, lateral pharyngeal, and retropharyngeal abscesses are prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium and peptostreptococcus spp.; aerobic organisms are group a streptococcus ( streptococcus pyogenes ), staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae . anaerobic bacteria can be isolated from most abscesses whenever appropriate techniques for their cultivation have been used, while s. pyogenes is isolated in only about one third of cases. more than two thirds of deep neck abscesses contain beta-lactamase producing organisms. management of tonsillar, peritonsillar, and retropharyngeal abscesses is similar. systemic antimicrobial therapy should be given in large doses whenever the diagnosis is made. however, when pus is formed, antimicrobial therapy is effective only in conjunction with adequate surgical drainage. untreated abscesses can rupture spontaneously into the pharynx, causing catastrophic aspiration. other complications are extension of infection laterally to the side of the neck or dissection into the posterior mediastinum through facial planes and the prevertebral space. death can occur from aspiration, airway obstruction, erosion into major blood vessels, or extension to the mediastinum.

TI  == effect of antimicrobial therapy with amoxicillin and cefprozil on bacterial interference and beta-lactamase production in the adenoids.
AB  == to compare the effects on the bacterial flora of the adenoids of antimicrobial therapy with amoxicillin or cefprozil, we enrolled in a prospective randomized study 60 children scheduled for elective adenoidectomy because of recurrent otitis media. they were randomized before surgery into 3 groups of 20 patients each: a no-therapy group, and groups with 10 days of either amoxicillin or cefprozil therapy. core adenoid materials were quantitatively cultured for aerobic and facultative bacteria. the in vitro ability of alpha-hemolytic streptococci (ahs) to inhibit the growth of non-type b haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae was determined. the number of organisms in adenoids obtained from patients treated with either antibiotic was reduced as compared to  that in adenoids from controls. however, in patients treated with amoxicillin, a  significant decline in the number of ahs, and an increase (in staphylococcus aureus) or no change in the number of other beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (blpb) was noted. in contrast, in those treated with cefprozil, no change was noted in the frequency of recovery of ahs, and the number of blpb decreased. interfering ahs were more often recovered in patients treated with cefprozil. we  conclude that the adenoids contain more interfering ahs after therapy with a second-generation oral cephalosporin (cefprozil) than after amoxicillin therapy.  this study suggests a potential beneficial effect of using an antimicrobial that  selectively spares interfering ahs while inhibiting blpb.

TI  == bone infection.
AB  == osteomyelitis, or bone infection, affects all age groups and develops from various sources including haematogenously from distant infection foci, from external sources such as post-operative or post-traumatic wound infections and from adjoining soft tissue infections. staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae are the most common pathogens of haematogenous osteomyelitis. aerobic and facultative gram-negative bacteria have  emerged as significant pathogens in some types of osteomyelitis while anaerobic bacteria are increasingly recognized as potential pathogens in non-haematogenous  osteomyelitis. the emergence of antibiotic resistance is of increasing concern, although improvements in radiologic imaging, antibiotic treatment and heightened  awareness have led to earlier detection such that long-term sequelae and morbidity are now primarily due to delays in diagnosis and inadequate treatment.

TI  == single species biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates on gutta-percha points.
AB  == the participation of bacterial biofilms in the over-filled gutta-percha points associated with refractory periapical periodontitis has recently been reported. this study investigated the initial biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia) on gutta-percha points in vitro. each bacterial strain was suspended in 100% cell culture medium or in culture medium containing 4.5, 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the bacterial suspensions were then co-incubated anaerobically with gutta-percha  points for 7 d. the gutta-percha points were processed for scanning electron microscopic observation and examined for biofilm presence and thickness. e. faecalis, strep. sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus biofilms were generated on the surfaces of the specimens incubated in culture medium supplemented with 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the e. faecalis and strep. sanguis biofilms were significantly thicker than those of strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus. no biofilms were detected on the specimens incubated with f. nucleatum, prop. acnes, porph. gingivalis and prev. intermedia. these findings suggest that gram-positive facultative anaerobes have the ability  to colonize and form extracellular matrices on gutta-percha points, while serum plays a crucial role in biofilm formation.

TI  == a randomized crossover study investigating the influence of ranitidine or omeprazole on the pharmacokinetics of cephalexin monohydrate.
AB  == limited data characterize pharmacokinetic interactions between cephalexin and ranitidine, and no data exist for an interaction with proton pump inhibitors. the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of ranitidine or omeprazole  administration on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cephalexin. a randomized single- and multiple-dose crossover study was conducted in healthy subjects ingesting cephalexin before and after steady-state administration of ranitidine or omeprazole. time-concentration profiles were determined and pharmacokinetic parameters were characterized using noncompartmental methods. pharmacokinetic data were analyzed in accordance with the two 1-sided test for bioequivalence. the percentage of time that serum concentrations remain above the mic(90) during the dosing interval (t > mic(90)) for streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus associated with the pharmacokinetic profiles was calculated. the coadministration of cephalexin with ranitidine or omeprazole resulted in relatively minor changes in c(max), auc(infinity), t(1/2), or cl/f. t(max) was significantly prolonged when cephalexin was administered with ranitidine or omeprazole. suboptimal t > mic(90) was observed for cephalexin irrespective of acid suppression. delay in absorption of cephalexin resulted in a decrease in the percentage of t > mic(90) for certain acid-suppressive regimens and pathogen combinations. with the exception of an increase in t(max), there were no significant pharmacokinetic interactions between cephalexin and ranitidine or omeprazole. delayed t(max) associated with acid suppression may result in a diminished t > mic(90).

TI  == daptomycin - a novel antibiotic against gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == daptomycin is a novel member of a new class of antimicrobial agents used in treating resistant gram-positive infections. these infections are becoming more commonplace and treatment options are limited. at present, daptomycin is approved for use in the us for complicated skin and skin-structure infections that are a common complication of surgery, diabetic foot ulcers, and burns. the most common  causative organisms in these types of infections are staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and group c and g streptococci. traditionally, these infections have been treated with penicillin and cephalosporins, but resistance to these agents is widespread and increasing. of particular concern is the rapid increase in methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). the sentry antimicrobial surveillance programme reported that approximately 30% of s. aureus isolates from skin and skin-structure infections were mrsa. the standard treatment for mrsa infections is vancomycin but resistance to this agent is also developing. there is a continuing need for the development of new antibiotics with gram-positive activity, to combat multi-drug-resistant gram-positive infections.

TI  == acute mastoiditis in infancy: the soroka experience: 1990-2000.
AB  == acute mastoiditis (am) is an uncommon but serious complication of acute otitis media (aom). in the pre-antibiotic era, am was seen more frequently than it is today, but it was rare in infants. however, in the last two decades an increase in the incidence of am in infancy has been reported in the literature. during the years 1990-2002, we treated 113 patients with 128 episodes of am; of them, 24 were infants (median age 6 months; 18 males) who suffered from 26 episodes of am. twenty developed am as a complication of their first episode of aom. one of the four infants with a prior history of aom suffered from common variable immunodeficiency. a significant increase in the incidence of am in infants was recorded during the study period (p = 0.01). the most common presenting clinical  signs were post-auricular swelling and fever >38 degrees c (77% and 77%, respectively, of all patients). seventeen episodes of am were not treated with prior antibiotics. tympanocentesis was performed in all episodes of am. middle ear fluid culture was positive in 17 (65%) of the 26 am episodes. the most common pathogens cultured were streptococcus pneumoniae (10 infants, 58% of all pathogens, 3/10 intermediately susceptible to penicillin) followed by streptococcus pyogenes (4, 23%), non-typable h. influenzae (2, 12%) and s. aureus (1, 6%). temporal bone ct showed bone destruction in 14 patients; 3 infants had subperiosteal abscesses and 3 lateral sinus thrombosis. ten infants underwent mastoid surgery due to non-resolution of symptoms and signs with antibiotic therapy. eight underwent cortical mastoidectomy with two patients undergoing ventilation tube introduction only. the remainder of the infants healed with conservative treatment. conclusions: (1) a significant increase in the incidence  of am in infants was recorded over the last decade, though a specific reason for  this trend remains uncertain; (2) most of the cases of am followed the infant's initial aom episode, and most of the infants had not received prior antibiotic therapy; (3) the clinical signs and symptoms of am were more severe in infants than in older patients; (4) while s. pneumonia was the most common pathogen isolated in middle ear fluid cultures, the involvement of s. pyogenes in am was higher than that reported in aom.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == effect of pathogen-specific clinical mastitis on milk yield in dairy cows.
AB  == our objective was to estimate the effects of the first occurrence of pathogen-specific clinical mastitis (cm) on milk yield in 3071 dairy cows in 2 new york state farms. the pathogens studied were streptococcus spp.,staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus spp., escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., arcanobacterium pyogenes, other pathogens grouped together, and "no pathogen isolated." data were collected from october 1999 to july 2001. milk samples were collected from cows showing signs of cm and were sent to the quality milk production services laboratory at cornell university for microbiological culture. the sas statistical procedure proc mixed, with an autoregressive covariance structure, was used to quantify the effect of cm and several other control variables (herd, calving season, parity, month of lactation, j-5 vaccination status, and other diseases) on weekly milk yield. separate models were fitted for primipara and multipara, because of the different shapes of their lactation curves. to observe effects of mastitis, milk weights were divided into  several periods both pre- and postdiagnosis, according to when they were measured in relation to disease occurrence. another category contained cows without the type of cm being modeled. because all pathogens were modeled simultaneously, a control cow was one without cm. among primipara, staph. aureus, e. coli, klebsiella spp., and "no pathogen isolated" caused the greatest losses. milk yield generally began to drop 1 or 2 wk before diagnosis; the greatest loss occurred immediately following diagnosis. mastitic cows often never recovered their potential yield. among older cows, streptococcus spp., staph. aureus, a. pyogenes, e. coli, and klebsiella spp. caused the most significant losses. many multipara that developed cm were actually higher producers before diagnosis than  their nonmastitic herd-mates. as in primipara, milk yield in multipara often began to decline shortly before diagnosis; the greatest loss occurred immediately following diagnosis. milk loss persisted until at least 70 d after diagnosis for  streptococcus spp., klebsiella spp., and a. pyogenes. the tendency for higher producing cows to contract cm may mask its impact on cow health and production. these findings provide dairy producers with more information on which pathogen-specific cm cases should receive treatment and how to manage these cows, thereby reducing cm impact on cow well being and profitability.

TI  == use of an oligonucleotide array for laboratory diagnosis of bacteria responsible  for acute upper respiratory infections.
AB  == we developed a diagnostic array of oligonucleotide probes targeting species-specific variable regions of the genes encoding topoisomerases gyrb and pare of respiratory bacterial pathogens. suitable broad-range primer sequences were designed based on alignment of gyrb/pare sequences from nine different bacterial species. these species included corynebacterium diphtheriae, fusobacterium necrophorum, haemophilus influenzae, legionella pneumophila, moraxella catarrhalis, mycoplasma pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes. specific probe sequences were selected by comparative analysis against the european bioinformatics database, as well as gyrb/pare sequences generated for this study. to verify specificity, at least six initial oligonucleotide probe sequences per bacterial species were tested by hybridization on a solid glass support using culture collection strains as templates. finally, three oligonucleotide probes per bacterial species were utilized to examine 65 middle ear fluid and 29 throat swab samples. the sensitivities of the developed assay compared to classic culture from middle ear fluid samples for h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, and s. pneumoniae were 96 (93 for culture), 73 (93 for culture), and 100% (78% for culture), respectively. no cross-reactivity with bacterial species belonging to the normal oral flora was observed when the 29 throat swab samples were studied.  the sensitivity of the assay to detect s. pyogenes from these samples was 93% (80% for culture). these results provide a proof of concept for the diagnostic use of microarray technology based on broad-range topoisomerase gene amplification, followed by hybridization and specific detection of bacterial species.

TI  == phages and the evolution of bacterial pathogens: from genomic rearrangements to lysogenic conversion.
AB  == comparative genomics demonstrated that the chromosomes from bacteria and their viruses (bacteriophages) are coevolving. this process is most evident for bacterial pathogens where the majority contain prophages or phage remnants integrated into the bacterial dna. many prophages from bacterial pathogens encode virulence factors. two situations can be distinguished: vibrio cholerae, shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli, corynebacterium diphtheriae, and clostridium botulinum depend on a specific prophage-encoded toxin for causing a specific disease, whereas staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium harbor a multitude of prophages and each phage-encoded virulence or fitness factor makes an incremental contribution to the fitness of the lysogen. these prophages behave like "swarms" of related prophages. prophage diversification seems to be fueled by the frequent transfer of phage material by recombination with superinfecting phages, resident prophages, or occasional acquisition of other mobile dna elements or bacterial chromosomal genes. prophages also contribute to the diversification of the bacterial genome architecture. in many cases, they actually represent a large fraction of the strain-specific dna sequences. in addition, they can serve as anchoring points for genome inversions. the current review presents the available genomics and biological data on prophages from bacterial pathogens in an evolutionary framework.

TI  == survival and surface adherence ability of bacterial pathogens in oral liquid pharmaceuticals and their containers.
AB  == the survival and surface adherence ability of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in nutrient broth and in five oral liquid pharmaceuticals (nivaquine syrup, cough mixture, paracetamol elixir, cotrimoxazole and vitamin c) were investigated the bacteria grew more in nutrient broth than in the pharmaceuticals (p < 0. 001) and the recovery of stressed cells was enhanced when 3% tween 80 was used as the recovery medium as against the use of normal saline (p < 0.01). the gram-negative bacteria were more adapted to the pharmaceuticals than their gram-positive counterparts. klebsiella pneumoniae and ps. aeruginosa were recovered in large numbers from nivaquine and cotrimoxazole suspensions that did  not support the growth of the other bacteria. the effect of bacterial growth on the physico-chemical properties of the pharmaceuticals was also evaluated the properties were not altered significantly except for ph shifts of 0.3 to 1.1 caused by e. coli and s. aureus in paracetamol and vitamin c. adherence capability was found to correlate with the survival ability of the bacteria. populations on coupons were significantly higher when nutrient broth was used as  the suspending medium compared with any of the pharmaceuticals (p < 0.01). rubber and plastic coupons were significantly more accessible to the bacteria than glass coupon as revealed by the high population of bacteria recovered from their surfaces.

TI  == synthesis and antimicrobial activity of new 7 beta-(benzo[a]dihydrocarbazolyloxyacetyl)-substituted cephalosporins.
AB  == selected 7beta-(benzo[a]dihydrocarbazolyloxyacetyl)-substituted cephalosporins (1a-e) were synthesised and tested for their antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative clinical pathogens. all compounds synthesised (1a-e) showed an in vitro antimicrobial activity similar to that of ceftriaxone and cefpirome against the gram-positive bacteria, and superior to that of penicillin and cefaclor against pen-r staphylococcus aureus species. like all beta-lactam agents, compounds 1a-e were in an inactive minimum inhibitory concentration (mic > 32 microg/ml) against methicillin-resistant s. aureus species. furthermore, as expected, no cross-resistance was observed against the erythromycin-resistant staphylococcus pyogenes strain. finally, it is worth underlining that compounds 1a and 1e showed a similar activity to that of ceftriaxone and superior to cefaclor against penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, a key respiratory tract infection (rti) causing pathogen difficult to treat with currently marketed antibiotics.

TI  == identification, characterisation and specificity of a cell wall lytic enzyme from lactobacillus fermentum br11.
AB  == screening of a genomic library with an antiserum raised against whole lactobacillus fermentum br11 cells identified a clone expressing an immunoreactive 37-kda protein. analysis of the 3010-bp dna insert contained within the clone revealed four open reading frames (orfs). one orf encodes lysa,  a 303 amino acid protein which has up to 35% identity with putative endolysins from prophages lj928 and lj965 from lactobacillus johnsonii and lp1 and lp2 from  lactobacillus plantarum as well as with the endolysin of lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage phiadh. the immunoreactive protein was shown to be encoded by a truncated orf downstream of lysa which has similarity to glutamyl-trna synthetases. the n-terminus of lysa has sequence similarity with n-acetylmuramidase catalytic domains while the c-terminus has sequence similarity with putative cell envelope binding bacterial sh3b domains. c-terminal bacterial  sh3b domains were identified in the majority of lactobacillus bacteriophage endolysins. lysa was expressed in escherichia coli and unusually was found to have a broad bacteriolytic activity range with activity against a number of different lactobacillus species and against lactococcus lactis, streptococci and  staphylococcus aureus. it was found that lysa is 2 and 8000 times more active against l. fermentum than l. lactis and streptococcus pyogenes, respectively.

TI  == detection of circulating superantigens in an intensive care unit population.
AB  == objective: plasma concentrations of superantigens were measured in an intensive care unit (icu) population and the relationship of superantigen positive rates with the presence of sepsis was investigated. methods: plasma samples were collected at least twice a week from 78 patients whose primary diagnoses were abdominal disorders (n = 27), respiratory disorders (n = 11), trauma (n = 10), burns (n = 10), cardiovascular disorders (n = 4), neurological disorders (n = 2), and others (n = 14). five different species of superantigens, i.e., staphylococcal enterotoxins a, b, and c (sea, seb, and sec), toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (tsst-1), and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin a (spea), were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: significant levels of plasma superantigens were detected in 16 patients. sea was found in seven patients, seb  in four patients, sec in two patients, tsst-1 in six patients, and spea in five patients. superantigen detection rates were 6% (1/17) in patients without systemic inflammatory response syndrome (sirs), 0% (0/21) in sirs patients without infection, 31% (5/16) in septic patients without shock, and 42% (10/24) in septic shock patients. conclusions: the presence of superantigens was confirmed in part of the icu population. the role of superantigens in the pathogenesis of sepsis remains to be determined.

TI  == cot mattresses as reservoirs of potentially harmful bacteria and the sudden infant death syndrome.
AB  == cot mattress materials were investigated as potential reservoirs of bacteria in relation to the sudden infant death syndrome (sids). the sleeping position of the infant significantly influenced bacterial population density of cot mattress polyurethane foams (p<0.0000001) and their covers (p<0.004). staphylococcus aureus was isolated at significantly higher frequency (p<0.03) from the infant's  head region of cot mattress materials. significantly higher bacterial population  densities (p<0.001) were associated with polyurethane foams from non-integral mattresses (exposed polyurethane foam), when compared to those from mattresses completely covered by polyvinyl chloride (integral type mattress). the frequency  of isolation of s. aureus from polyurethane foams from non-integral mattresses was also significantly higher (p=0.03) than from foams from the integral type. the following factors were significantly associated with increased frequency of isolation of s. aureus: from the polyurethane foam, previous use of non-integral  mattresses by another child (p=0.03 for all sample sites, p=0.01 for torso region); from the covers, sleeping in the prone position (p=0.003 head region, p=0.001 torso region). prone sleeping was also significantly associated with increased bacterial population levels (p=0.01) and increased frequency of isolation of escherichia coli (p=0.02) from the torso region of cot mattress covers. these findings could explain some recently identified risk factors for sids associated with type and previous use of cot mattresses. clostridium perfringens was isolated at very low frequency and streptococcus pyogenes was not isolated from any cot mattress materials tested.

TI  == emerging gram-positive bacterial infections.
AB  == over the last several decades, a number of previously known or newly described species of gram-positive bacteria have emerged as important human pathogens, particularly in industrialized countries. these microbes have demonstrated an impressive ability to produce an array of striking infectious diseases never before seen or only infrequently encountered in the past. despite aggressive therapeutic intervention, many of these conditions portend significant morbidity  and mortality. diseases caused by members of the staphylococcus and streptococcus genera have figured prominently in this regard, with staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, and other beta-hemolytic streptococci being  regarded as the most important species. this review focuses on the clinical and microbiologic aspects of key emerging infections caused by this group of microorganisms.

TI  == application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  == a rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. nylon membrane was used as the array support. a mutation region of the 23s rrna gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. a pair of universal primers was designed for pcr amplification of the 23s rrna gene. twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. the 23s rrna gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, shigella dysenteriae, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, proteus vulgaris, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. two other species (salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with e. coli, but  the reaction did not affect their detection. after redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with staphylococcus aureus, but not  with clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pyogenes. the oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne  infections. the superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.

TI  == managing toxic shock syndrome with antibiotics.
AB  == toxic shock syndrome (tss) is a serious disorder with a worldwide prevalence of approximately 3/100,000 persons. tss is mainly caused by streptococcus pyogenes or staphylococcus aureus. thus, beta-lactam and lincosamides, such as clindamycin, are the first-line drugs. yet, the mortality rate remains unacceptably high; highlighting the role of bacterial toxin-mediated activation of the inflammatory cascade in tss pathogenesis. further strategies should be targeted towards interfering with the interaction between bacterial toxins and host t cells. this paper aims to provide an overview of the epidemiology, pathomechanisms, and clinical presentation of tss, and criteria for selecting drugs among available antibiotics.

AB  == a decade after the superantigen hypothesis for kd was first suggested, it has still not been either proven or refuted conclusively. although initial optimism for the hypothesis was quashed by a series of published papers apparently refuting the idea, in the last few years there have been a number of good studies providing evidence in support of the superantigen hypothesis. whether this renewed enthusiasm is justified will hopefully become clear in the near future. ultimately, accurate diagnosis, more targeted treatment, and preventative strategies depend on the unraveling of the immunopathogenesis of this disease.

AB  == to identify factors associated with and to describe treatment outcomes of pediatric subacute or chronic osteomyelitis (s/co), we retrospectively identified 52 patients with s/co from january 1994 to november 1999 seen at a large pediatric hospital infectious disease clinic. s/co was defined by the following:  >10 days of clinical symptoms; radiographic, surgical, or pathologic changes consistent with s/co; or relapse of prior osteomyelitis. of these patients 63% were male, median age 9 years. bones involved included vertebra (19% of subjects), femur (17%), finger (12%), humerus (10%), and tibia (8%). sixty-five percent had at least 1 risk factor (most commonly hardware, neurologic disease or preceding trauma, sepsis, or surgery). blood, bone, or wound aspirate cultures were positive in 67%, most commonly for staphylococcus aureus. erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr) was elevated in 88% of 41 patients at the time of diagnosis. intravenous antibiotics were given for a median of 6 weeks and oral antibiotics for a median of 4.5 months. one child had a complication. in conclusion, consideration of s/co should be high when predisposing factors are present. esr may be useful for determining effectiveness and duration of therapy. with prolonged antibiotic therapy nearly all patients demonstrated resolution of  disease.

TI  == crystallographic and mutational data show that the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin j can use a common binding surface for t-cell receptor binding and dimerization.
AB  == the protein toxins known as superantigens (sags), which are expressed primarily by the pathogenic bacteria staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, are  highly potent immunotoxins with the ability to cause serious human disease. these sags share a conserved fold but quite varied activities. in addition to their common role of cross-linking t-cell receptors (tcrs) and major histocompatibility complex class ii (mhc-ii) molecules, some sags can cross-link mhc-ii, using diverse mechanisms. the crystal structure of the streptococcal superantigen streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin j (spe-j) has been solved at 1.75 a resolution (r = 0.209, r(free) = 0.240), both with and without bound zn(2+). the structure displays the canonical two-domain sag fold and a zinc-binding site that is shared by a subset of other sags. most importantly, in concentrated solution and in the  crystal, spe-j forms dimers. these dimers, which are present in two different crystal environments, form via the same face that is used for tcr binding in other sags. site-directed mutagenesis shows that this face is also used for tcr binding spe-j. we infer that spe-j cross-links tcr and mhc-ii as a monomer but that dimers may form on the antigen-presenting cell surface, cross-linking mhc-ii and eliciting intracellular signaling.

AB  == we evaluated the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) system (bag, lich, germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification  of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive bactec 9240 blood culture bottles. the test involves amplification of the bacterial dna by multiplex pcr and subsequent hybridization  of the pcr product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an elisa-based format. the available probes allow the separate detection of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal meca  gene. the hyplex bloodscreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (s. aureus, 100%; s. epidermidis, 97.2%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). the specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (escherichia coli, 92.5%; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; klebsiella spp., 100%; enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; s. aureus, 100%, s. epidermidis, 97.7%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus  faecium, 99.6%; streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). the result of the meca gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of staphylococcus aureus investigated. in conclusion, the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-elisa system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the meca gene of staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.

AB  == background & objectives: human and animal cystatins have been shown to inhibit the replication of certain viruses and bacteria, though it is not directly demonstrated that the effects are due to protease inhibitory capacity of the cystatins. we report antibacterial properties of a novel antimicrobial peptidyl derivative, (2s)-2-(n(alpha)-benzyloxycarbonyl-arginyl-leucylamido)-1-[(e)-cinnamoylamido]-3- methylbutane, structurally based upon the aminoterminal segment of the inhibitory centre of the human cysteine protease inhibitor, cystatin c. methods: clinical isolates of group a, b, c and g streptococci were collected. the antibacterial activity of cystapep 1 derivative was tested by agar well diffusion method. results: cystapep 1, displayed antibacterial activity against several clinically  important gram-positive bacteria. it displayed minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of about 16 microg/ml for both staphylococcus aureus  and streptococcus pyogenes. in radial agar diffusion assays, groups a, b, c and g streptococci as well as staphylococci were generally susceptible to the action of cystapep 1, whereas pneumococci and enterococci were less susceptible. no activity against gram-negative bacteria was observed. interpretation & conclusion: cystapep 1 also showed high activity against methicillin-resistant staph. aureus (mrsa) and multi-antibiotic resistant coagulase negative staphylococci (cns), suggesting its mechanism of action to be different from most currently used antibiotics.

TI  == identification and characterization of bacterial-binding property in the type iii repeat domain of fibronectin.
AB  == to characterize fibronectin binding with granulicatella adiacens, a causative agent of infective endocarditis, monoclonal antibodies were generated against human fibronectin and selected for their capacity to inhibit the fibronectin binding of the organism. thermolysin and lysyl-endopeptidase digests of fibronectin were characterized by western blot. the epitope of inhibitory monoclonal antibody was found in the central portion of fibronectin known as the  cell-binding domain, and not in the n-terminal portion known to be the binding region of most microbial species, e.g., staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. while these two species could bind to both the n-terminal and central portion, escherichia coli and g. adiacens bind only to the latter. excess amounts of free fibronectin in the solution inhibited the bacterial adherence to the n-terminal fibronectin fragment, but not to the central region, thereby suggesting the central region plays a significant role for in vivo bacterial colonization in the presence of high concentrations of soluble fibronectin.

AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

TI  == twinned or not twinned, that is the question: crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis of the 2f1(3)f1 module pair of human fibronectin.
AB  == human fibronectin (fn) is a large multidomain protein found in the extracellular  matrix and plasma. it is involved in many cellular processes, including cell adhesion and migration during embryogenesis and wound healing. the ability to bind fn is a characteristic that has been demonstrated for a number of pathogens. for staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes in particular, fn-binding bacterial proteins (fnbps) have been shown to mediate not only bacterial adhesion to host cells but also the uptake of bacteria by the cells. fnbps interact with the amino-terminal region of fn, where five type i ((1-5)f1) fn modules are located. although the structures of two f1 module pairs have been determined by nmr, no x-ray structures have been reported. to explore the conformational interactions between modules and the binding properties of fnbps, the (2)f1(3)f1  module pair was crystallized using the vapour-diffusion method at 298 k. 12 x-ray diffraction data sets have been collected: six on an in-house rotating anode (three native, one pt derivative and two peptide-bound) and six at synchrotron-radiation sources (two native and four derivative). following analysis of these data, some of which have very high multiplicity (up to 50), probable space-group assignments were made (p42(1)2, p4(1)2(1)2 or p4(3)2(1)2) and the possibly twinned nature of the crystals was investigated using six different tests. the results presented here suggest that the crystals are not twinned.

TI  == peptide antagonists of superantigen toxins.
AB  == superantigens produced by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes are among the most lethal of toxins. toxins in this large family trigger an excessive cellular immune response leading to toxic shock. superantigens are secreted by the bacteria as diverse natural mixtures, a complexity that demands development of broad-spectrum countermeasures. we used a rational approach to design short peptides with homology to various domains in a typical superantigen (staphylococcal enterotoxin b) and screened each peptide for its ability to antagonize, in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, superantigen-mediated induction of the genes encoding t helper 1 cytokines that mediate shock: interleukin-2, interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor. a dodecamer peptide proved a potent antagonist against widely different superantigens. this peptide protected mice from killing by superantigens and it was able to rescue mice undergoing toxic shock. the antagonist peptide shows homology to a beta-strand-hinge-alpha-helix domain that is structurally conserved among superantigens, yet currently of unknown function and remote from the binding sites for the known ligands essential for t cell activation, the major histocompatibility complex class ii molecule and t cell receptor. the antagonist  activity of this peptide thus identifies a novel domain in superantigens that is  critical for their toxic action. the antagonist peptide provides a new tool for understanding the mechanism of excessive human immune response activation by superantigens that occurs during toxic shock and for identification of a novel target ligand that may interact with this superantigen domain.

TI  == regulation of ido-mediated bacteriostasis in macrophages: role of antibiotics and anti-inflammatory agents.
AB  == induction of ido is also under strict control by the immune system and we have previously shown that there are a number of cytokines involved in the down-regulation of ido induction. in clinical practice anti-inflammatory substances and antibiotics are commonly used and may influence the outcome of bacterial infection. we analysed the ifngamma-dependant ido induction and bacteriostasis of staphylococcus aureus and group a streptococcus (gas) in monocyte-derived-macrophages (mdm) from cord blood and peripheral blood of healthy adult donors with attention to the effect of down-regulatory cytokines and of two commonly used anti-inflammatory agents, hydrocortisone and indomethacin, on both ido activity and bacterial growth. in addition to this we were interested in the effect of sub-inhibitory concentrations of the antibiotic  ampicillin on this ido-mediated effect, the premise being that for a substantial  period of antibiotic therapy the infection site is exposed to sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotic. we found that after stimulation with ifngamma, mdm  inhibited streptococcal growth. this was due to ifngamma-induced ido activity as  demonstrated by reconstitution of growth by supplemental tryptophan. this ido-mediated bacteriostasis was inhibited by the cytokines il-10, il-4 and tgfbeta. furthermore, addition of indomethacin to ifngamma stimulated mdm also resulted in the abrogation of the ido-induced bacteriostasis, a result of the inhibition of ido induction. surprisingly, co-stimulation with hydrocortisone and ifngamma apparently increased the ido activity in cord blood mdm, but had no effect on the ido-activity of adult peripheral blood mdm. bacteriostasis in cord  blood mdm, on the other hand, was not affected by co-stimulation with hydrocortisone. ampicillin, in sub-inhibitory concentrations had no effect on the ido activity itself but did have a synergistic effect on the ido-induced bacteriostasis in mdm cultures. we conclude that therapy with indomethacin may increase the risk of clinically important bacterial infection due to the inhibition of the ido-induced bacteriostasis. in addition sub-inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin may play a role in the area of infection where ifngamma stimulated macrophages are to be found in abundance.

TI  == common pathogens and differential diagnosis of skin and soft tissue infections.
AB  == the major organisms responsible for skin infections are staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. to produce a disease state, both organisms must overcome  the body's natural defenses, adhere to the skin, invade the tissue, and proliferate. often, endogenous skin microflora can lead to systemic infections, especially in immunocompromised individuals. the differential diagnosis of skin infections is key to successful therapy and requires a thorough knowledge of the  patient's clinical history and immune status. laboratory analysis often can assist in the pathogenic differentiation. examples of common skin infections are  illustrated herein.

TI  == epidemiology and prevention of skin and soft tissue infections.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes remain the 2 major organisms responsible for most common skin and soft tissue infections. while methicillin-resistant s aureus (mrsa) typically is considered a hospital-acquired organism, outbreaks of community-acquired mrsa are being reported. simple interventions can reduce the spread of this infection. erysipelas is a streptococcal syndrome with high morbidity. the epidemiology has changed, with an increasing number of cases involving the lower extremities. risk factors for erysipelas can be identified, which allow clinicians to target patients at high risk for recurrent disease. although staphylococci and streptococci are the predominant cutaneous pathogens, enterococci and gram-negative organisms account  for a significant proportion of skin infections.

TI  == serious bacterial infections in newborn infants in developing countries.
AB  == purpose of review: the overwhelming majority of the world's annual 4 million neonatal deaths occur in developing countries. this review therefore briefly addresses the burden, aetiology, prevention and management of serious neonatal bacterial infections in low-income settings. recent findings: bacterial infection is the biggest cause of neonatal admissions to hospitals, and probably the biggest cause of morbidity in the community, but its burden is unclear. the commonest serious infections involve bacteraemia, meningitis and respiratory infection, and case fatality rates may be as high as 45%. key pathogens are escherichia coli, klebsiella species, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. the incidence of neonatal infections with group b streptococcus is highly variable, as is the spectrum of antimicrobial resistance. summary: current areas of research include the rectification of micronutrient deficiencies, neonatal skin care, appropriate breastfeeding recommendations, cleansing of the birth canal, and simplified methods of diagnosis of infection. operational activities include the control of neonatal tetanus, the diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted infections, integrated strategies for improving pregnancy, childbirth and neonatal survival, community-based management of acute  respiratory infections, and community-based management of neonatal sepsis.

TI  == superantigens: structure-function relationships.
AB  == superantigens are a class of highly potent immuno-stimulatory molecules produced  by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. these toxins possess the unique ability to interact simultaneously with mhc class ii molecules and t-cell  receptors, forming a trimolecular complex that induces profound t-cell proliferation. the resultant massive cytokine release causes epithelial damage and leads to capillary leak and hypotension. the staphylococcal superantigens are designated staphylococcal enterotoxins a, b, c (and antigenic variants), d, e, and the recently discovered enterotoxins g to q, and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1. the streptococcal superantigens include the pyrogenic exotoxins a (and antigenic variants), c, g-j, smez, and ssa. superantigens are implicated in several diseases including toxic shock syndrome, scarlet fever and food poisoning; and their function appears primarily to debilitate the host sufficiently to permit the causation of disease. structural studies over the last 10 years have provided a great deal of information regarding the complex interactions of these molecules with their receptors. this, combined with the wealth of new information from genomics initiatives, have shown that, despite their common molecular architecture, superantigens are able to crosslink mhc class ii molecules and t-cell receptors by a variety of subtly different ways through the use of various structural regions within each toxin.

TI  == skin infections of the limbs of polynesian children.
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to obtain information regarding the incidence of cellulitis or cutaneous abscess in children of polynesian ethnicity (including new zealand maori), and to calculate the relative risk increase versus other ethnicities. methods: we reviewed all patients aged between 1 to 14 years who were admitted at our tertiary care institution during the year 2000. ninety-one children (of 10 different ethnicities) with skin infections were identified. results: the most common diagnosis was cutaneous abscess (46 of 91 cases, 50.5%), followed by cellulitis (45 of 91 cases, 49.5%). the most common location of infection was the lower limb (79.1%). the major pathogenic organisms were staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. all but one of the children had an uneventful recovery. the incidence of infection in the polynesian children was 137.7 per 100,000, and the incidence in european children (and children of other  ethnic groups) was 35.4 per 100,000. in addition, we calculated a relative risk increase of 3.89 (95% confidence interval of 2.33 to 6.52, p <0.05), which underlines the increased risk that polynesian children suffer from skin infection. conclusion: this is the first study showing (in detail) how polynesian children are affected by a high incidence and increased relative risk of skin infections in their limbs (arms and legs). however, further research (to identify whether genetic disposition or social and environmental circumstances are involved) is required.

TI  == efficacy and tolerability assessment of cefprozil in children with acute otitis media.
AB  == young children contract as many as six to eight upper respiratory tract viral infections per year, and these infections frequently lead to secondary bacterial  infections such as acute otitis media and sinusitis. cefprozil is an orally active third generation cephalosporin which has demonstrated activity against the gram-positive organisms streptococcus pyogenes, pneumoniae and agalactiae and against methicilin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus. cefprozil is also active against various gram-ves and certain anaerobic organisms, and is stable to hydrolysis by a number of b-lactamases. present study is an effort to study the efficacy and safety of cefprozil in children with acute otitis media. three hundred and thirty four children aged 6 months through 12 years with clinical symptoms and tympanic membrane signs of aom received cefprozil 30 mg/kg/day in two divided doses per day for 10 days. clinically, 96.6% patients were cured, 2.4% improved and there was failure of therapy in 1% of the patients. there was no need for any rescue medication and any change in antibiotic in any patient. a  satisfactory bacteriological outcome was (i.e. cure, presumed cure, and cure plus reinfection with a different pathogen) was achieved in 95% of patients. in conclusion, cefprozil is a well tolerated and effective drug for acute otitis media in children. moreover, its expanded spectrum of activity, ability to achieve adequate concentrations in tissues, suitability for twice-daily dosing, and proven tolerability suggest that it is a better alternative to agents conventionally used in acute otitis media.

AB  == background: in our study the in vitro susceptibility of common pathogens that cause respiratory tract and abdominal wound infections was tested against two newer fluorquinolones (moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin) as well as levofloxacin and azithromycin. methods: 50 isolates each of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and haemophilus  influenzae isolated from the respiratory tract and from wounds were tested for their susceptibility to moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and azithromycin. results: moxifloxacin proved to be the most active substance against the tested gram-positive pathogens. gatifloxacin was the most active against p. aeruginosa. moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin proved to be comparably active against the clinical isolates of e. coli and h. influenzae. conclusions: moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin display excellent activity against respiratory pathogens as well as nosocomial pathogens causing abdominal wound infections. when treating infections caused by p. aeruginosa the earlier fluorquinolones such as ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin are the substances of choice.

TI  == comparative analysis of gene expression among low g+c gram-positive genomes.
AB  == we present a comparative analysis of predicted highly expressed (phx) genes in the low g+c gram-positive genomes of bacillus subtilis, bacillus halodurans, listeria monocytogenes, listeria innocua, lactococcus lactis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium acetobutylicum, and clostridium perfringens. most enzymes acting in glycolysis and fermentation pathways are phx in these genomes, but not those involved in the tca cycle and respiration, suggesting that these organisms have predominantly adapted to grow rapidly in an anaerobic environment. only b. subtilis and b. halodurans have several tca cycle phx genes, whereas the tca pathway is entirely  missing from the metabolic repertoire of the two streptococcus species and is incomplete in listeria, lactococcus, and clostridium. pyruvate-formate lyase, an  enzyme critical in mixed acid fermentation, is among the highest phx genes in all these genomes except for c. acetobutylicum (not phx), and b. subtilis, and b. halodurans (missing). pyruvate-formate lyase is also prominently phx in enteric gamma-proteobacteria, but not in other prokaryotes. phosphotransferase system genes are generally phx with selection of different substrates in different genomes. the various substrate specificities among phosphotransferase systems in  different genomes apparently reflect on differences in habitat, lifestyle, and nutrient sources.

TI  == concentrations of moxifloxacin in serum and synovial fluid, and ex vivo bactericidal activity against arthritis-causing pathogens.
AB  == three doses of moxifloxacin 400 mg qd were administered orally to 20 candidates for knee arthroscopy (mean age, 71.2 years). the procedure was scheduled at four  different points of time after the last dose: 2, 6, 12, and 24 h. five patients were studied at each point of time. drug levels were determined by the bioassay method. bactericidal activity against four bacterial pathogens (two strains of each) was studied on serum and synovial fluid samples obtained during arthroscopy using the nccls guidelines. mean (+/-s.d.) peak serum and synovial fluid concentrations were 3.46 +/- 0.78 mg/l and 3.42 +/- 0.51 mg/l, respectively. levels above 1.0 mg/l were detected as long as 24 h. the peak bactericidal titers were (in serum and synovial fluid, respectively) 1:18.3 and 1:32 against staphylococcus aureus, 1:18.3 and 1:22.6 against streptococcus pyogenes, 1:45.2 and 1:64.0 against klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1:2.3 and 1:1.7 against pseudomonas aeruginosa. bactericidal titers >1:2 were documented against the first three pathogens up to 24 h after dosing. on the basis of its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, moxifloxacin seems to be an excellent candidate  for the treatment of joint infections, except those caused by p. aeruginosa.

TI  == comparative genomics of gene-family size in closely related bacteria.
AB  == background: the wealth of genomic data in bacteria is helping microbiologists understand the factors involved in gene innovation. among these, the expansion and reduction of gene families appears to have a fundamental role in this, but the factors influencing gene family size are unclear. results: the relative content of paralogous genes in bacterial genomes increases with genome size, largely due to the expansion of gene family size in large genomes. bacteria undergoing genome reduction display a parallel process of redundancy elimination, by which gene families are reduced to one or a few members. gene family size is also influenced by sequence divergence and physiological function. large gene families show wider sequence divergence, suggesting they are probably older, and  certain functions (such as metabolite transport mechanisms) are overrepresented in large families. the size of a given gene family is remarkably similar in strains of the same species and in closely related species, suggesting that homologous gene families are vertically transmitted and depend little on horizontal gene transfer (hgt). conclusions: the remarkable preservation of copy  numbers in widely different ecotypes indicates a functional role for the different copies rather than simply a back-up role. when different genera are compared, the increase in phylogenetic distance and/or ecological specialization  disrupts this preservation, albeit in a gradual manner and maintaining an overall similarity, which also supports this view. hgt can have an important role, however, in nonhomologous gene families, as exemplified by a comparison between saprophytic and enterohemorrhagic strains of escherichia coli.

TI  == interplay between superantigens and immunoreceptors.
AB  == superantigens (sags) cause a massive t-cell proliferation by simultaneously binding to major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class ii on antigen-presenting  cells and t-cell receptors (tcrs) on t cells. these t-cell mitogens can cause disease in host, such as food poisoning or toxic shock. the best characterized groups of sags are the bacterial sags secreted by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. despite a common overall three-dimensional fold of these  sags, they have been shown to bind to mhc class ii in different ways. recently, it has also been shown that sags have individual preferences in their binding to  the tcrs. they can interact with various regions of the variable beta-chain of tcrs and at least one sag seems to bind to the alpha-chain of tcrs. in this review, different subclasses of sags are classified based upon their binding mode to mhc class ii, and models of trimolecular complexes of mhc-sag-tcr molecules are described in order to reveal and understand the complexity of sag-mediated t-cell activation.

AB  == we investigated the bacterial flora present in skin lesions of patients with chiclero's ulcer from the yucatan peninsula of mexico using conventional culture  methods (11 patients), and an immunocolorimetric detection of pathogenic streptococcus pyogenes (15 patients). prevalence of bacteria isolated by culture  methods was 90.9% (10/11). we cultured, from chiclero's ulcers (60%), pathogenic  bacterial such as staphylococcus aureus (20%), s. pyogenes (1.6%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.6%), morganella morganii (1.6%), and opportunist pathogenic bacteria such as klebsiella spp. (20.0%), enterobacter spp. (20%), and enterococcus spp. (20%). we also cultured coagulase-negative staphylococci in 40% (4/10) of the remaining patients. micrococcus spp. and coagulase-negative staphylococci constituted the bacterial genuses more frequently isolated in the normal skin of patients with chiclero's ulcer and healthy individuals used as controls. we also undertook another study to find out the presence of s. pyogenes by an immunocolorimetric assay. this study indicated that 60% (9/15) of the ulcerated lesions, but not normal controls, were contaminated with s. pyogenes. importantly, individuals with purulent secretion and holding concomitant infections with s. pyogenes, s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, m. morganii, and e. durans took longer to heal leishmania (l.) mexicana infections treated with antimonial drugs. our results suggest the need to eliminate bacterial purulent infections, by antibiotic treatment, before starting antimonial administration to patients with chiclero's ulcer.

TI  == differences in potency of intravenous polyspecific immunoglobulin g against streptococcal and staphylococcal superantigens: implications for therapy of toxic shock syndrome.
AB  == administration of intravenous polyspecific immunoglobulin g (ivig) has been proposed as adjunctive therapy for toxic shock syndrome caused by streptococcus pyogenes or staphylococcus aureus. we investigated whether superantigen-containing culture supernatants prepared from streptococcal isolates (n=21) and staphylococcal isolates (n=20) from cases of severe sepsis were inhibited to an equal extent by ivig in proliferation experiments that used human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. all 3 ivig preparations tested were highly efficient in neutralizing the superantigens, and most supernatants were completely inhibited at concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 2.5 mg ivig/ml. an important finding was that culture supernatants from s. pyogenes isolates were consistently inhibited to a greater extent than those of s. aureus isolates (p<.01). the findings demonstrate that staphylococcal superantigens are not inhibited as efficiently as streptococcal superantigens by ivig, and, hence, a higher dose of ivig may be required for therapy of staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome in order to achieve protective titers and clinical efficacy.

TI  == new antibacterial agents derived from the dna gyrase inhibitor cyclothialidine.
AB  == cyclothialidine (1, ro 09-1437) is a potent dna gyrase inhibitor that was isolated from streptomyces filipinensis nr0484 and is a member of a new family of natural products. it acts by competitively inhibiting the atpase activity exerted by the b subunit of dna gyrase but barely exhibits any growth inhibitory activity against intact bacterial cells, presumably due to insufficient permeation of the  cytoplasmic membrane. to explore the antibacterial potential of 1, we developed a flexible synthetic route allowing for the systematic modification of its structure. from a first set of analogues, structure-activity relationships (sar)  were established for different substitution patterns, and the 14-hydroxylated, bicyclic core (x) of 1 seemed to be the structural prerequisite for dna gyrase inhibitory activity. the variation of the lactone ring size, however, revealed that activity can be found among 11- to 16-membered lactones, and even seco-analogues were shown to maintain some enzyme inhibitory properties, thereby  reducing the minimal structural requirements to a rather simple, hydroxylated benzyl sulfide (xi). on the basis of these "minimal structures" a modification program afforded a number of inhibitors that showed in vitro activity against gram-positive bacteria. the best activities were displayed by 14-membered lactones, and representatives of this subclass exhibit excellent and broad in vitro antibacterial activity against gram-positive pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and enterococcus faecalis, and overcome resistance against clinically used drugs. by improving the pharmacokinetic properties of the most active compounds (94, 97), in particular by lowering their lipophilic properties, we were able to identify congeners of cyclothialidine (1) that showed efficacy in vivo.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  == the ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. these pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. these infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer  generations of antibiotics. in this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis  and endophthalmitis. the ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis. mic90 values for the drugs  against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/ml to 0.57 mg/ml and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. the mic90 for gatifloxacin against streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/ml compared with 0.73 mg/ml for moxifloxacin (p = .011). among the gram-negative isolates, the mean mic90 for gatifloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/ml compared with 2.60 mg/ ml for moxifloxacin (p = .023).  mic90 values for gatifloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. for the atypicals, the mic90 values for gatifloxacin against nocardia asteroides and mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.

AB  == the lectin pathway of complement is activated when a carbohydrate recognition complex and associated serine proteases binds to the surface of a pathogen. three recognition subcomponents have been shown to form active initiation complexes: mannan-binding lectin (mbl), l-ficolin, and h-ficolin. the importance of mbl in antimicrobial host defense is well recognized, but the role of the ficolins remains largely undefined. this report shows that l-ficolin specifically binds to lipoteichoic acid (lta), a cell wall component found in all gram-positive bacteria. immobilized lta from staphylococcus aureus binds l-ficolin complexes from sera, and these complexes initiate lectin pathway-dependent c4 turnover. c4  activation correlates with serum l-ficolin concentration, but not with serum mbl  levels. l-ficolin binding and corresponding levels of c4 turnover were observed on lta purified from other clinically important bacteria, including streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae. none of the lta preparations bound mbl, h-ficolin, or the classical pathway recognition molecule, c1q.

TI  == clinical and bacteriological efficacy of the ketolide telithromycin against isolates of key respiratory pathogens: a pooled analysis of phase iii studies.
AB  == a pooled analysis of data from 13 phase iii studies of telithromycin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, acute sinusitis or group a beta-haemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis  and tonsillitis was undertaken. causative key respiratory tract pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes) were isolated at entry to the studies from cultures of relevant respiratory samples and tested for their susceptibility to telithromycin, penicillin and macrolides (erythromycin a). the  combined clinical and bacteriological efficacy of telithromycin at the post-therapy, test-of-cure visit (days 17-24) was assessed in patients from whom  a microbiologically evaluable pathogen was isolated at entry. more than 98% of key respiratory pathogens isolated, including penicillin g- and macrolide (erythromycin a)-resistant strains of s. pneumoniae, demonstrated full or intermediate susceptibility to telithromycin in vitro at the breakpoints of < or  = 1.0 mg/l (susceptible) and 2.0 mg/l (intermediate) used for the purpose of evaluating the susceptibility of isolates recovered during the clinical trials. treatment with telithromycin 800 mg once-daily for 5, 7 or 7-10 days resulted in  high rates of clinical cure (88.5%) and a satisfactory bacteriological outcome (88.9%), similar to the figures seen with comparator antibacterial agents. clinical cure and eradication rates were good for all key respiratory pathogens,  including penicillin g- and macrolide (erythromycin a)-resistant s. pneumoniae. the results suggest that telithromycin will provide effective empirical therapy for community-acquired upper and lower respiratory tract infections.

AB  == mutations in genes coding for l4 (rpld) or l22 (rplv) ribosomal proteins or in 23s rrna (rrl gene) are reported as a cause of macrolide resistance in streptococci and staphylococci. this study was aimed at evaluating a denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dhplc) technique as a rapid mutation screening method. portions of these genes were amplified by pcr from total dna of 48 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 22), staphylococcus aureus (n = 16),  streptococcus pyogenes (n = 6), streptococcus oralis (n = 2), and group g streptococcus (n = 2). thirty-seven of these strains were resistant to macrolides and harbored one or several mutations in one or two of the target genes, and 11 were susceptible. pcr products were analyzed by dhplc. all mutations were detected, except a point mutation in a pneumococcal rpld gene. the method detected one mutated rrl copy out of six in s. aureus. this automated method is promising for screening of mutations involved in macrolide resistance in gram-positive cocci.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial susceptibility for czop were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen species (2,363 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the  clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis  (msse), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), streptococcus milleri group and peptostreptococcus spp. the antibacterial activity of czop either against mssa or msse was preferable (mic90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/ml) and comparable to those of other cephems. czop was also effective  on mrse (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) but not on mrsa. czop and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop  against e. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (cpr; mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) and higher than those of other cephems. no antibacterial activity  of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, like other drugs. the antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and cpr (mic90: < or = 0.063 microgram/ml), and, against s. agalactiae,  was also preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml). czop indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against pssp, pisp, or prsp (mic90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. milleri group was also preferable, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint mic of czop was 95.9% in mrsa, 93.5% in prsp, 63.3% in pisp, 35.8% in s. haemolyticus, 27.9% in e. faecalis, and 13.3% mrse. those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (cfpm), but e. faecalis showed 91.2% for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. in correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of prsp was not inhibited at breakpoint mic either czop or  cfpm while 69.2% at breakpoint mic either czop or ceftazidime. in conclusion, the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. a decline in the sensitivities of s. saprophyticus, s. milleri group, pisp, and prsp to czop, however, was suggested.

TI  == acute bacterial skin infections in pediatric medicine: current issues in presentation and treatment.
AB  == bacterial skin and skin structure infections commonly encountered in children include impetigo, folliculitis, furunculosis, carbuncles, wound infections, abscesses, cellulitis, erysipelas, scarlet fever, acute paronychia, and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. if diagnosed early and treated appropriately, these infections are almost always curable, but some have the potential to cause serious complications such as septicemia, nephritis, carditis  and arthritis if diagnosis is delayed and/or treatment is inadequate. during the  initial evaluation, it is important to determine whether the infection is superficial or deep, and whether it is localized or spreading. prompt treatment is essential if the infection appears to be spreading, as the sequelae can be life threatening. once the proper diagnosis is made, the next important step is selecting the most appropriate therapy. in children presenting with mild or moderately severe bacterial skin and skin structure infections and not requiring  inpatient management or urgent operative debridement, prompt provision of oral antimicrobial therapy avoids the risk of worsening infection or hospitalization.  empiric antimicrobial therapy should be directed at the most likely pathogens, (e.g. staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes), although some infections  (e.g. subcutaneous abscesses and cellulitis following animal or human bites) may  have a polymicrobial origin. in choosing the appropriate antimicrobial therapy, one must take into account the resistance profile of the target pathogen, the agent's antibacterial profile and intrinsic activity against the target pathogen, and its pharmacokinetic properties (including absorption, elimination, and extent of tissue penetration). other factors to consider include tolerability of the drug, convenience of the dosing regimen, and acceptability and palatability of the oral formulation administered. any treatment plan for bacterial skin and skin structure infections should aim to minimize the emergence of resistant organisms  so that the risk of their dissemination to others in the community is reduced. oral antimicrobial agents currently available that may be considered include: beta-lactamase-stable penicillins (e.g. cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, and amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium), the macrolides (e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin), and the cephalosporins. cephalosporins are now the most commonly used class, particularly because of increasing resistance among strains of s. pyogenes to erythromycin (and by implication, the other macrolides). the second- and third-generation cephalosporins have many advantages, with their extended spectra of antimicrobial activity, favorable pharmacokinetic and tolerability profiles, and convenient dosage schedules. the third-generation agent, cefdinir, has good activity against a broad range of likely pathogens, including staphylococci, a twice-daily administration schedule, a favorable efficacy and tolerability profile, is well accepted by young children when administered as an oral suspension, and may be an attractive alternative in  the pediatric setting.

TI  == acylation of sc4 dodecapeptide increases bactericidal potency against gram-positive bacteria, including drug-resistant strains.
AB  == we have conjugated dodecyl and octadecyl fatty acids to the n-terminus of sc4, a  potently bactericidal, helix-forming peptide 12-mer (klfkrhlkwkii), and examined  the bactericidal activities of the resultant sc4 'peptide-amphiphile' molecules.  sc4 peptide-amphiphiles showed up to a 30-fold increase in bactericidal activity  against gram-positive strains (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and  bacillus anthracis), including s. aureus strains resistant to conventional antibiotics, but little or no increase in bactericidal activity against gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa). fatty acid  conjugation improved endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) neutralization by 3- to 6-fold. although acylation somewhat increased lysis of human erythrocytes, it did not increase lysis of endothelial cells, and the haemolytic effects occurred at concentrations 10- to 100-fold higher than those required for bacterial cell lysis. for insight into the mechanism of action of sc4 peptide-amphiphiles, cd, nmr and fluorescence spectroscopy studies were performed in micelle and liposome  models of eukaryotic and bacterial cell membranes. cd indicated that sc4 peptide-amphiphiles had the strongest helical tendencies in liposomes mimicking bacterial membranes, and strong membrane integration of the sc4 peptide-amphiphiles was observed using tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy under these conditions; results that correlated with the increased bactericidal activities of sc4 peptide-amphiphiles. nmr structural analysis in micelles demonstrated that the two-thirds of the peptide closest to the fatty acid tail exhibited a helical conformation, with the positively-charged side of the amphipathic helix interacting more with the model membrane surface. these results indicate that conjugation of a fatty acid chain to the sc4 peptide enhances membrane interactions, stabilizes helical structure in the membrane-bound state and increases bactericidal potency.

AB  == objectives: garenoxacin is a novel des-f(6)quinolone that has shown excellent antimicrobial activity against a wide range of clinically important microorganisms. in this study, its activity was examined, in comparison with that of other antimicrobial agents, by susceptibility and time-kill testing against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and respiratory pathogens. methods: overall, 200 bacterial strains were tested. the antimicrobial activity of garenoxacin was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin,  amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, imipenem, erythromycin and clarithromycin. in addition, the bactericidal activity of garenoxacin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin was evaluated by time-kill analysis against four strains each of staphylococci [two methicillin-susceptible (mssa) and two methicillin-resistant (mrsa)], pneumococci (two penicillin-susceptible and two penicillin-resistant) and streptococcus pyogenes (two erythromycin-susceptible and two erythromycin-resistant). antibiotics were tested at concentrations 1-8 x mic. results: mic90 values of garenoxacin for the mssa and mrsa strains were 0.03 and 2 mg/l, respectively. among all the quinolones tested, garenoxacin yielded the lowest mic values against all pneumococci (mic90 0.12 mg/l) irrespective of macrolide resistance; the rank order of activity was garenoxacin> moxifloxacin>levofloxacin>ciprofloxacin. excellent activity was shown also against haemophilus influenzae (mic90 <or= 0.03 mg/l) and moraxella catarrhalis (mic90 <or= 0.03 mg/l). ninety percent of s. pyogenes were inhibited at garenoxacin concentrations equal to 0.25 mg/l, its activity not being influenced  by macrolide susceptibility. garenoxacin was rapidly bactericidal against staphylococci, producing a >or= 3 log10 decrease in viable counts (cfu/ml) within 3 h at 4 x mic, whereas a moderate, slower killing rate was observed versus streptococci. conclusions: this investigational des-f(6)quinolone represents a promising alternative for the treatment of respiratory tract infections.

TI  == secondary infections with beta-hemolytic streptococci in skin lesions.
AB  == secondary infections (si) in skin lesions are common. in the present study 40 beta-hemolytic streptococci were isolated from 36 patients suffering from si due  to various skin diseases. staphylococcus aureus coexisted with beta-hemolytic streptococci in 29 of these cases (81%), and beta-hemolytic streptococci were often associated with coagulase-negative staphylococci and gram-positive rods. eighteen patients (50%) carried beta-hemolytic streptococci predominantly. in most cases of si due to atopic dermatitis (ad), the predominant species was s. aureus, while in other skin diseases, s. aureus and beta-haemolytica streptococci were predominant in approximately 50% of the patients, except for si due to tumors and viral diseases. the mean age of patients with si and beta-hemolytic streptococci was 37 years and that of patients with si and predominant s. aureus  was 32 years. the lower mean age found for s. aureus was due to si found in patients with ad. this study emphasizes the polymicrobial microbiology of si.

TI  == cutaneous infections in the elderly: diagnosis and management.
AB  == over the past several years there have been many advances in the diagnosis and treatment of cutaneous infectious diseases. this review focuses on the three major topics of interest in the geriatric population: herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia (phn), onychomycosis, and recent advances in antibacterial therapy. herpes zoster in adults is caused by reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (vzv) that causes chickenpox in children. for many years acyclovir was the gold standard of antiviral therapy for the treatment of patients with herpes zoster. famciclovir and valacyclovir, newer antivirals for herpes zoster, offer less frequent dosing. phn refers to pain lasting > or = 2 months after an acute attack of herpes zoster. the pain may be constant or intermittent and may occur spontaneously or be caused by seemingly innocuous stimuli such as a light touch. treatment of established phn through pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapy will be discussed. in addition, therapeutic strategies to prevent phn will be reviewed. these include the use of oral corticosteroids, nerve blocks, and treatment with standard antiviral therapy. onychomycosis, or tinea unguium, is caused by dermatophytes in the majority of cases, but can also be caused by candida and nondermatophyte molds. onychomycosis is found more frequently in the elderly and in more males than females. there are four types of onychomycosis: distal subungual onychomycosis, proximal subungual onychomycosis, white superficial onychomycosis, and candidal onychomycosis. over  the past several years, new treatments for this disorder have emerged which offer shorter courses of therapy and greater efficacy than previous therapies. the treatment of bacterial skin and skin structure infections in the elderly is an important issue. there has been an alarming increase in the incidence of gram-positive infections, including resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and drug-resistant pneumococci. while vancomycin has been considered the drug of last defense against gram-positive multidrug-resistant bacteria, the late 1980s saw an increase in vancomycin-resistant bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). more recently, strains of vancomycin-intermediate resistant s. aureus (visa) have been isolated. gram-positive bacteria, such as s. aureus and streptococcus pyogenes are often the cause of skin and skin structure infections, ranging from mild pyodermas to complicated infections including postsurgical wound infections, severe carbunculosis, and erysipelas. with limited treatment options, it has become critical to identify antibiotics with novel mechanisms of  activity. several new drugs have emerged as possible therapeutic alternatives, including linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin.

TI  == assessment of streptococcus pyogenes microcolony formation in infected skin by confocal laser scanning microscopy.
AB  == background: streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus are often simultaneously detected from many cases of non-bullous impetigo with atopic dermatitis. objectives: using confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm), to investigate formation of s. pyogenes microcolonies in skin lesions. methods: the  s. pyogenes cells in the stationary growth phase alone were strongly stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-concanavalin a (fitc-cona), and this staining was reduced by pretreatment with amylase. although the components of sugars in glycocalyx produced by s. pyogenes cells are unknown, we suggested that the materials stained by fitc-cona were consistent with the presence of cona-reactive sugars in glycocalyx produced by s. pyogenes cells. results: s. pyogenes cells associated with streptococcal impetigo skin and croton-oil inflamed mouse skin formed microcolonies encircled by materials (glycocalyx) that stained strongly with fitc-cona, and these findings were consistent with those in biofilms. in croton-oil inflamed mouse skin, polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns) infiltrated to just below the epidermis in the cefdinir-treated group but only to the middle  dermis in the cefdinir-non-treated group. in this case s. pyogenes and s. aureus  cells formed separate microcolonies and existed independently in the outer walls  of pustule lesions of streptococcal impetigo. conclusion: in skin infections, s.  pyogenes and s. aureus formed aggregates of microcolonies (similar to that in biofilms) encircled by glycocalyx, which can make the infection hard to eradicate using an antimicrobial agent alone. the effect of conventional antimicrobial agents against biofilm is mainly due to the increase of the invasion of pmns into the biofilm.

TI  == streptococcus pyogenes infection induces septic arthritis with increased production of the receptor activator of the nf-kappab ligand.
AB  == bacterial arthritis is a rapidly progressive and highly destructive joint disease in humans, with staphylococcus aureus and neisseria gonorrhoeae the major causative agents, although beta-hemolytic streptococci as well often induce the disease. we demonstrate here that intravenous inoculation of cd-1 mice with the group a streptococcus (gas) species streptococcus pyogenes resulted in a high incidence of septic arthritis. signs of arthritis emerged within the first few days after injection, and bacterial examinations revealed that colonization of the inoculated gas in the arthritic joints persisted for 21 days. induction of persistent septic arthritis was dependent on the number of microorganisms inoculated. immunohistochemical staining of gas with anti-gas antibodies revealed colonization in the joints of infected mice. cytokine levels were quantified in the joints and sera of infected mice by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. high levels of interleukin-1beta (il-1beta) and il-6 were detected in the  joints from 3 to 20 days after infection. we noted that an increase in the amount of receptor activator of nf-kappab ligand (rankl), which is a key cytokine in osteoclastogenesis, was also evident in the joints of the infected mice. rankl was not detected in sera, indicating local production of rankl in the infected joints. blocking of rankl by osteoprotegerin, a decoy receptor of rankl, prevented bone destruction in the infected joints. these results suggest that gas can colonize in the joints and induce bacterial arthritis. local rankl production in the infected joints may be involved in bone destruction.

TI  == inhibition of fibronectin binding of some bacterial cells by subtle ph increase within the physiological range.
AB  == the fibronectin (fn)-binding ability of microorganisms is considered to be involved in their pathogenicities. granulicatella adiacens, a member of the oral  flora and a causative agent of culture-negative infective endocarditis, showed nearly maximum binding to immobilized fn at ph 7.2 but greatly reduced binding at a slightly higher ph 7.4 and almost no binding at ph 7.6 in the presence of physiological concentration of nacl (0.15 m). a similar ph-sensitive fn-binding property was noted with escherichia coli and abiotrophia defectiva, but not with  streptococcus pyogenes nor staphylococcus aureus. in contrast, bindings to laminin and fibrinogen observed for some of these strains were unaffected by the  same ph changes. this fastidious ph-dependency of fn-binding abilities of some bacteria warns that the ph condition must be seriously considered in the in vitro assay of bacterial adherence to fibronectin.

TI  == six cases of bacterial infection in porous orbital implants.
AB  == background: we present 6 cases of bacterial infection that developed after porous orbital implant surgery. cases: five patients with hydroxyapatite implants showed lid swelling, discharge, and suppurative granuloma 14 days to 3 years after surgery. the hydroxyapatite implants were removed 14 days to 41 months postoperatively, and synthetic porous polyethylene orbital implants were inserted. thick discharge and conjunctival melting was noted 14 months after primary medpor implant surgery in the sixth patient, and the infection was controlled by medical therapy. observations: the culture of specimens removed with swabs from the conjunctiva of patients and from the hydroxyapatite implants  showed growth of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus and peptostreptococcus in 4 patients, whereas streptococcus pyogenes were cultured from the conjunctiva in the medpor implant patient. culture for the remaining patient was negative . conclusions: if there is continuous pain, injection, and discharge after porous implant insertion, bacterial infection in the implant should be considered immediately. systemic antibiotics and topical eye drops should be administered without delay. if no improvement is observed, the implant should be removed and a different approach must be considered.

TI  == bacterial pathogens modulate an apoptosis differentiation program in human neutrophils.
AB  == human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns or neutrophils) are essential to the innate immune response against bacterial pathogens. recent evidence suggests that pmn apoptosis facilitates resolution of inflammation during bacterial infection.  although progress has been made toward understanding apoptosis in neutrophils, very little is known about transcriptional regulation of this process during bacterial infection. to gain insight into the molecular processes that facilitate resolution of infection, we measured global changes in pmn gene expression during phagocytosis of a diverse group of bacterial pathogens. genes encoding key effectors of apoptosis were up-regulated, and receptors critical to innate immune function were down-regulated during apoptosis induced by phagocytosis of burkholderia cepacia, borrelia hermsii, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pyogenes. importantly, we identified genes that comprise a common apoptosis differentiation program in human pmns after phagocytosis of pathogenic bacteria. unexpectedly, phagocytosis of str. pyogenes  induced changes in neutrophil gene expression not observed with other pathogens tested, including down-regulation of 21 genes involved in responses to ifn. compared with other bacteria, pmn apoptosis was significantly accelerated by str. pyogenes and was followed by necrosis. thus, we hypothesize that there are two fundamental outcomes for the interaction of bacterial pathogens with neutrophils: (i) phagocytosis of bacteria induces an apoptosis differentiation program in human pmns that contributes to resolution of bacterial infection, or (ii) phagocytosis of microorganisms such as str. pyogenes alters the apoptosis differentiation program in neutrophils, resulting in pathogen survival and disease.

TI  == many chemokines including ccl20/mip-3alpha display antimicrobial activity.
AB  == previous studies have demonstrated that beta-defensins exhibit chemotactic activity by sharing the chemokine receptor ccr6 with the cc chemokine ligand ccl20/macrophage-inflammatory protein-3alpha (mip-3alpha). structural analysis of ccl20/mip-3alpha revealed that most of the positively charged residues are concentrated at one area of its topological surface, a characteristic considered  to be important for the antimicrobial activity of defensins. here, we report that similar to defensins, ccl20/mip-3alpha has antimicrobial effects on escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, and candida albicans. additionally,  by screening a total of 30 human chemokines, we have identified an additional 17  human chemokines, which exhibit antimicrobial activity in vitro. collectively, about two-thirds of the chemokines investigated so far has the capacity to kill microorganisms in vitro, suggesting that antimicrobial activity may be another host-defense function for certain chemokines. comparison of the structural characteristics between antimicrobial and nonantimicrobial chemokines suggests that topological formation of a large, positively charged electrostatic patch on  the surface of the molecule is likely to be a common structural feature of antimicrobial chemokines.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of macrolides against recent clinical isolates, and analysis of resistant mechanisms].
AB  == we examined antibacterial activities of 4 kinds of macrolides, erythromycin (em), clarithromycin (cam), azithromycin (azm) and rokitamycin (rkm), against 6 bacterial species of clinical strains isoleted in 2002. bacterial isolates used were each 50 strains of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae and 43 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae. s. agalactiae were derived from gynecological samples, and other species were isolated from respiratory specimens. antimicrobial activities against s. aureus,  s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, m. catarrhalis and h. influenzae of 14-membered macrolides, such as em and cam, were higher than those of 16-membered macrolide,  rkm. by contrast, against s. pneumoniae, rkm was more effective than 14-membered  macrolides. six, three and four strains of s. aureus, s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae, respectively, were resistant to macrolides. thirty-five among 43 pneumococcal isolates were resistant, and 15 of the 35 were highly-resistant, mic of > 128 micrograms/ml, to any one of em, cam or azm. isolation frequency of resistant strains to rkm was lower than those to 14- and 15-membered macrolides:  only one strain was highly-resistant and 12 were intermediately-resistant. no resistant strain was recognized in m. catarrhalis and h. influenzae. further, we  analyzed the resistant mechanisms, methylation or efflux, of macrolide resistant  strains by the double-disk method. methylation was major mechanism in s. aureus,  and in s. pyogenes, all of the resistance was caused by methylation. in s. agalactiae and s. pneumoniae, methylation and efflux shared about half and half.

AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against over 4900 bacterial isolates was determined by microbroth dilution with interpretation in accordance with nccls guidelines. susceptibility results were compared with those for ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. gemifloxacin and the other fluoroquinolones were not affected by either beta-lactamase production or penicillin-resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae. the mic90 values for gemifloxacin were: s. pneumoniae 0.063 mg/l; haemophilus influenzae 0.016 mg/l; moraxella catarrhalis 0.008 mg/l, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus 0.063 mg/l; methicillin-susceptible streptococcus pyogenes 0.031 mg/l; enterobacteriaceae 0.031-0.16 mg/l; pseudomonas aeruginosa 4 mg/l; neisseria meningitidis 0.008 mg/l. the mic90 for gemifloxacin was lower than those for the  other quinolones tested against s. pneumoniae (ciprofloxacin 2-4 mg/l, gatifloxacin 0.5 mg/l, levofloxacin 1-2 mg/l, moxifloxacin 0.25 mg/l). this study confirms the enhanced potent activity of gemifloxacin against gram-positive pathogens, its broad-spectrum, gram-negative activity and indicates that gemifloxacin is likely to have an important role in treating patients with gram-positive and/or gram-negative infections.

TI  == comparative activity of telithromycin against typical community-acquired respiratory pathogens.
AB  == objectives: respiratory tract infections (rtis) remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. major bacterial pathogens in rtis, such as streptococcus pneumoniae, have exhibited increasing resistance to a variety of antibiotics during the past decades. telithromycin, the first ketolide, was designed especially to overcome this resistance. the present study was conducted to assess the comparative activity of telithromycin against typical rti pathogens in austria. methods: a total of 1,015 bacterial isolates was tested, including s. pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae. mics of the following antimicrobials: penicillin g, ampicillin (for h. influenzae), azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin a and telithromycin were determined using the nccls broth microdilution method. results: telithromycin showed excellent activity against s. pneumoniae, with 99.8% of all  isolates being susceptible. penicillin remained active with an mic50 and mic90 of 0.007 mg/l. nevertheless, a notable increase in penicillin intermediate-resistant and resistant isolates, from 4.9% in 1996 to the present rate of 10%, was observed. there was also a distinct rise in the resistance levels of s. pneumoniae against the macrolides. all tested isolates of s. pyogenes were susceptible to penicillin and telithromycin, and only low levels of resistance against telithromycin were found in s. aureus (2.2%, mic90 of 0.5 mg/l). no telithromycin-resistant isolate of h. influenzae could be detected. conclusions:  this study demonstrates the rising prevalence of resistance among s. pneumoniae not only to penicillin but also to other antimicrobials. it also shows the value  of telithromycin as an attractive option for the empirical treatment of community-acquired rtis in an era of widespread antibacterial resistance.

TI  == treatment of bacterial skin and skin structure infections.
AB  == bacterial skin and skin structure infections (sssis) are among the most frequently seen infectious entities in the community setting and occasionally in  the institutional setting. a wide variety of sssis exist, with cellulitis, impetigo and folliculitis being the most common. most sssis are caused by aerobic staphylococci and streptococci, with aerobic gram-negative bacilli and anaerobes  being involved in more complicated infections. systemic therapy with a variety of beta-lactams, macrolides and lincosamides (clindamycin) have been the cornerstone of sssi therapy for many years. with the exception of mupirocin, topical therapy  occupies a small therapeutic niche. despite the emergence of antimicrobial resistance among the pathogens most commonly associated with sssis (for example,  streptococcus pyogenes and macrolides; staphylococcus aureus and methicillin, vancomycin, penicillin and mupirocin), few treatment failures have been reported. the newest antimicrobials reviewed herein (linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin,  gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin and moxifloxacin) are not a significant improvement upon older agents in the treatment of sssis. perhaps this assessment will change  if the penetrance of the antimicrobial resistance patterns described above reach  a critical threshold and clinical failures become more widespread.

AB  == intracellularly persistent group a streptococci (gas, streptococcus pyogenes) have been associated with recurrent tonsillopharyngitis and antibiotic treatment  failure. as a supplementation of the published in vitro data, conventional bacteriology and molecular epidemiology was performed on material from 29 adult patients of a german army hospital with anamnestic signs of recurrent tonsillopharyngitis. pre-surgery tonsil swabs and the surgically removed tonsils  were examined with respect to growth of aerobic bacteria in absence and presence  of antibiotics with exclusively extracellular activity. under such antibiotic selection, staphylococcus aureus and gas were cultured from specimens of 13 and 3 patients, respectively. in every material gas-positive by culture methods, the intracellular location of the penicillin-susceptible gas isolates was confirmed by immunohistologic examination of tonsillar sections using a gas-specific igg antibody. the three intracellular gas isolates were typed by emm gene sequencing  and could be associated to types m6 and m49 (two isolates). the bacteria were serially passaged on sheep blood agar, and semiquantitative mrna analysis from virulence genes was performed using bacteria of the 4th and 25th passage after isolation. an m-type-specific pattern of virulence gene expression and different  gene expression levels in relation to the passage number were observed.

TI  == small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  == taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of gram-positive and gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus  pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, helicobacter pylori, chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, and campylobacter jejuni. large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two s. aureus libraries, highly representative. consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the  identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. the use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.

TI  == antibacterial resistance of community-acquired respiratory tract pathogens recovered from patients in latin america: results from the protekt surveillance study (1999-2000).
AB  == protekt (prospective resistant organism tracking and epidemiology for the ketolide telithromycin) is a global surveillance study established in 1999 to monitor antibacterial resistance of respiratory tract organisms. thirteen centers from argentina, brazil and mexico participated during 1999-2000; they collected 1806 isolates (streptococcus pneumoniae 518, haemophilus influenzae 520, moraxella catarrhalis 140, staphylococcus aureus 351, s. pyogenes 277). overall,  218 (42.1%) of the s. pneumoniae isolates had reduced susceptibility to penicillin, 79 (15.3%) were penicillin-resistant and 79 (15.3%) were erythromycin-resistant. mexico had the highest prevalence of penicillin (76.5%) and erythromycin (31.2%) resistance. of 77 erythromycin-resistant s. pneumoniae tested for resistance genotype, 43 possessed mef(a), 33 possessed erm(b) and 1 possessed both erm(b) and mef(a) mechanism. all s. pneumoniae isolates were fully susceptible to telithromycin, linezolid, teicoplanin and vancomycin. among h. influenzae isolates, 88 (16.9%) produced beta-lactamase, ranging from 11% (brazil) to 24.5% (mexico). among m. catarrhalis isolates, 138 (98.6%) produced beta-lactamase. twenty-four (8.7%) of the s. pyogenes isolates were erythromycin-resistant; resistance being attributable to mefa (n=18), ermtr (n=5) and ermb (n=1). all h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis and s. pyogenes were fully susceptible to telithromycin. methicillin resistance was found in 26.5% of the s. aureus isolates (argentina 15%; mexico 20%; brazil 31.3%). telithromycin was effective against 97.7% of methicillin-susceptible isolates. protekt confirms that antibacterial resistance is an emerging problem in latin america. the previously reported high levels of pneumococcal resistance to the beta-lactam and macrolides were exceeded. new agents that do not induce resistance or that exert  low selective pressure, e.g. telithromycin, are essential to safeguard future antibacterial efficacy.

AB  == background: the incidence and causative organisms associated with complicated parapneumonic effusions in children with community-acquired pneumonia are likely  to have changed during the past several years. methods: data regarding clinical and laboratory features were abstracted retrospectively from medical records of 76 subjects with complicated parapneumonic effusions at a tertiary children's hospital from 1996 through 2001. incidence rates per 10 000 hospital discharges and per 1000 patients with nonviral pneumonia were calculated. results: etiologic organisms were streptococcus pneumoniae (31 subjects), staphylococcus aureus (7), streptococcus pyogenes (5), abiotrophia sp. (1) and no culture-confirmed agent (32). the annual incidence of complicated parapneumonic effusions per 10 000 discharges progressively increased from 4.5 in 1996 to 25.0 in 1999 (p = 0.0001), then declined to 10.1 in 2001 (p = 0.03). similarly the incidence per 1000 cases  of nonviral pneumonia increased from 2.9 in 1996 to 11.0 in 1999 (p = 0.003) and  then declined to 4.8 in 2001 (p = 0.053). whereas s. pneumoniae was the leading confirmed etiology in each year, the proportion of cases caused by staphylococcus aureus increased from 6% in 1996 to 2000 (all of which were methicillin-susceptible) to 30% in 2001 (all methicillin-resistant; p = 0.04). conclusions: the incidence of complicated parapneumonic effusions in children with community-acquired pneumonia increased from 1996 to 1999 and then declined concomitant with the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. although cases caused by s. pneumoniae have decreased, community onset methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus has emerged as a cause of pneumonia with complicated effusions in children.

AB  == in order to better characterize bacteremic cellulitis caused by streptococcus pneumoniae, a review was conducted of 10 cases of bacteremic pneumococcal cellulitis, which represented 0.9% of all cases of pneumococcal bacteremia (n=1,076) and 3.2% of all cases of community-acquired bacteremic cellulitis (n=312) that occurred in the hospital de bellvitge, barcelona, from 1984 to 2001. in addition to these 10 cases, 28 cases of bacteremic pneumococcal cellulitis from the literature (medline 1975-2001) were reviewed. pneumococcal cellulitis of the face, neck, and trunk was observed more frequently in patients with systemic  lupus erythematosus and hematologic disorders, while pneumococcal cellulitis of the limbs was more common in patients with diabetes, alcoholism, and parenteral drug use. in the hospital de bellvitge group, bacteremic cellulitis due to streptococcus pneumoniae was more frequently associated with severe underlying diseases than that due to staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes (100%,  57%, and 72%, respectively;p=0.01). a concomitant extracutaneous focus of infection (e.g., respiratory tract infection) suggesting hematogenous spread with metastatic cellulitis was more frequent in patients with pneumococcal cellulitis, while a local cutaneous entry of microorganisms was feasible in most patients with staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes cellulitis. the 30-day mortality was 10% in patients with pneumococcal cellulitis, 13% in patients with  staphylococcus aureus cellulitis, and 23% in patients with streptococcus pyogenes cellulitis (p=0.3). thus, bacteremic pneumococcal cellulitis is an unusual manifestation of pneumococcal disease and occurs mainly in patients with severe underlying diseases. in most cases, pneumococcal cellulitis has a different pathophysiologic mechanism than cellulitis caused by staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes.

TI  == amoxicillin-sulbactam: a clinical and therapeutic review.
AB  == combinations of beta-lactamase inhibitors with penicillins, especially aminopenicillins, have broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against most of the  common pathogens of the respiratory and urinary tracts. this means that they are  an ideal treatment for infections such as otitis media, sinusitis, special cases  of pharyngeal tonsillitis (recurring forms, indirect pathogenic action, or after  the failure of amoxicillin monotherapy), acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, cystitis, urethritis, etc. the amoxicillin-sulbactam combination is active against both beta-lactamase producer and nonproducer strains, and is effective against gram-positive cocci (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus of nonhospital origin), gram-negative cocci (neisseria gonorrhoeae, moraxella catarrhalis and others), gram-negative bacilli  (nonhospital strains of haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae and others) and anaerobes. its antimicrobial activity means that it is indicated in the treatment of respiratory, ear, nose and throat, urinary, dermatological and gynecological infections caused by susceptible germs, as well  as in a variety of surgical situations (both as a treatment and as prophylaxis).  it is absorbed very well orally, and its pharmacokinetic profile is very favorable, with very good tissue penetration. it is reasonably well tolerated: in a variable percentage of cases it may cause modification of intestinal transit and/or fecal consistency, which usually abates spontaneously. the new formulation for administration at intervals of 12 h is easier to use, is better tolerated and favors completion of therapy. in summary, the amoxicillin-sulbactam combination is effective and well tolerated in most infections of nonhospital origin in adults and children.

TI  == [contribution of linezolid to the treatment of complicated infections of the skin and soft tissues].
AB  == three groups of increasing severity: according to the 2000 consensus conference,  bacterial infections of the skin and soft tissues can be classified in three categories of increasing severity: bacterial dermo-hypodermal infections, bacterial dermo-hypodermal necrotizing infections, necrotizing fasciitis. the last two categories are medicosurgical emergency conditions requiring repeated surgical debridement and probabilistic antibiotic therapy. linezolid: the clinical efficacy of linezolid in bacterial infections of the skin and soft tissues is comparable to that of oxacillin/dicloxacillin. several arguments (frequent implication of streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus, well-adapted spectrum, changing resistance pattern of gram-positive cocci, efficacy against associated bacteriemia, favorable kinetics and diffusion data in cutaneous tissues) argue in favor of the use of linezolid in infections of the skin and soft tissues

TI  == targeting bacterial virulence: the role of protein synthesis inhibitors in severe infections. insights from the society of infectious diseases pharmacists.
AB  == morbidity and mortality due to certain bacterial pathogens have not declined despite the availability of effective antimicrobial treatments. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes cause a number of serious infections, such as necrotizing fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome, which are associated with the release of bacterial toxins. animal studies have demonstrated clindamycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor, to be more effective in treating these severe infections than other more susceptible antimicrobial treatments. linezolid, another protein synthesis inhibitor, also has shown efficacy in in vitro studies. human trials to validate the effects of antibiotic therapies on bacterial virulence have not been performed. future animal and human studies are needed to  help elucidate the immunomodulatory mechanisms of protein synthesis inhibitors in order to optimize antimicrobial treatment and decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with severe bacterial infections.

TI  == pathogenic bacteria attach to human fibronectin through a tandem beta-zipper.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, two important human pathogens,  target host fibronectin (fn) in their adhesion to and invasion of host cells. fibronectin-binding proteins (fnbps), anchored in the bacterial cell wall, have multiple fn-binding repeats in an unfolded region of the protein. the bacterium-binding site in the amino-terminal domain (1-5f1) of fn contains five sequential fn type 1 (f1) modules. here we show the structure of a streptococcal  (s. dysgalactiae) fnbp peptide (b3) in complex with the module pair 1f12f1. this  identifies 1f1- and 2f1-binding motifs in b3 that form additional antiparallel beta-strands on sequential f1 modules-the first example of a tandem beta-zipper.  sequence analyses of larger regions of fnbps from s. pyogenes and s. aureus reveal a repeating pattern of f1-binding motifs that match the pattern of f1 modules in 1-5f1 of fn. in the process of fn-mediated invasion of host cells, therefore, the bacterial proteins seem to exploit the modular structure of fn by  forming extended tandem beta-zippers. this work is a vital step forward in explaining the full mechanism of the integrin-dependent fnbp-mediated invasion of host cells.

AB  == as a result of the appearance of bacterial strains resistant to 3rd generation cephlosporin, since 1993 cephalosporins of 4th generation have been developed and introduced in therapy; among them are: cefepime and cefpirome. cefepime is the most active 4th generation cephalosporin possessing the following advantages over the 3rd generation cephalosporins: high intrinsic potency due to rapid penetration into the periplasmic space; an extended spectrum of activity that includes many gram-positive and gram-negative organisms; activity against multi-resistant gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacter and klebsiella species; low potential for beta-lactamase induction, especially bush group 1 beta-lactamases, even ar low periplasmic concentrations; minimal selection of resistant mutant strains. its spectrum is very large being very active against gram-negative bacilii: enterobacter, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia, citrobacter, proteus mirabilis and less active against bacillus fragillis. cefepime is also very active against gram-positive cocci: staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains only), streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes. some of the methicillin-resistant strains of  staphylococcus are susceptible to cefepime; enterococcus is resistant. due to its high resistance against beta-lactamases cefepime (maxipime) is the best choice in life threatening nosocomial infections occuring in patients in the intensive care units. cefepime can be synergically associated with aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones.

AB  == between september and december 2001 in the "caritas" surgical clinic of bucharest has been conducted a clinical study for the efficiency of cefepime (maxipime) treatment in surgical patients. introduced in therapy in the last decade of the xxth century, cefepime (maxipime) is the most active 4th generation cephalosporin, due to its extended spectrum of activity and its high resistance against beta-lactamases. cefepime (maxipime) has a very large spectrum, including the majority of the microorganisms implicated in surgical infections: enterobacter, klebsiella pneumoniae/speciae, proteus mirabilis, bacillus fragillis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia, citrobacter and other gram-negative  bacilii, gram-positive cocci (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes). the clinical study included 30 surgical patients, the selection criteria being the severity of the present infection or the potential risk after major (abdominal) surgery. we introduced cefepime (maxipime) as first  choice of monotheraphy, except: severe, life threatening nosocomial infections, when we associated cefepime (maxipime) with aminoglycosides; failure of another antibiotheraphy schema, when we associated cefepime (maxipime) with aminoglycosides; suspicion of anaerobe contamination, when we associated cefepime (maxipime) with metronidazole. the results of our study support the utilization of cefepime (maxipime) as the best choice antibiotic in severe surgical infections, especially in the intensive care and surgical units. cefepime (maxipime) can be synergically associated with aminoglycosides and imidazoles (metronidazole).

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of community-acquired respiratory tract pathogens in north america in 1999-2000: findings of the protekt surveillance study.
AB  == the protekt surveillance study commenced in 1999 to examine the antimicrobial susceptibility of community-acquired respiratory pathogens. we report here the results from 2371 isolates collected during 2000 by north american centers (canada, n = 7; usa, n = 8). overall, 21.3% of pneumococci (n = 687) were penicillin g-resistant (canada, 10.3%; usa, 32.6%). corresponding rates of erythromycin resistance were 16.3% and 31.5%. telithromycin inhibited all penicillin- and erythromycin-resistant isolates at < or =1 microg/ml. among 612 hemophilus influenzae isolates, 22.4% were beta-lactamase-positive. antimicrobial susceptibility of h. influenzae varied between 82.4% (clarithromycin) and 100% (cefpodoxime, levofloxacin). importantly, one isolate was found to be resistant to both moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin. most moraxella catarrhalis isolates were  highly susceptible to the antimicrobials tested, except ampicillin. all streptococcus pyogenes isolates (n = 382) were penicillin-susceptible and 5.2% were non-susceptible to erythromycin. s. pyogenes showed cross-resistance to other macrolides yet remained inhibited by telithromycin at < or =0.5 microg/ml.  methicillin resistance among staphylococcus aureus was common (19.9%), particularly in the usa. the protekt study confirms the widespread prevalence of  antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens in north america, and hence the need for continued surveillance to guide optimal empiric therapy for community-acquired respiratory tract infections.

TI  == adhesive surface proteins of erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae bind to polystyrene, fibronectin, and type i and iv collagens.
AB  == erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is a gram-positive bacterium that causes erysipelas  in animals and erysipeloid in humans. we found two adhesive surface proteins of e. rhusiopathiae and determined the nucleotide sequences of the genes, which were colocalized and designated rspa and rspb. the two genes were present in all of the serovars of e. rhusiopathiae strains examined. the deduced rspa and rspb proteins contain the c-terminal anchoring motif, lpxtg, which is preceded by repeats of consensus amino acid sequences. the consensus sequences are composed of 78 to 92 amino acids and repeat 16 and 3 times in rspa and rspb, respectively. adhesive surface proteins of other gram-positive bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes adhesin-like protein, streptococcus pyogenes protein f2 and f2-like protein, streptococcus dysgalactiae fnbb, and staphylococcus aureus cna, share the same consensus repeats. furthermore, the n-terminal regions of rspa and rspb  showed characteristics of the collagen-binding domain that was described for cna. rspa and rspb were expressed in escherichia coli as histidine-tagged fusion proteins and purified. the recombinant proteins showed a high degree of capacity  to bind to polystyrene and inhibited the binding of e. rhusiopathiae onto the abiotic surface in a dose dependent manner. in a solid-phase binding assay, both  of the recombinant proteins bound to fibronectin, type i and iv collagens, indicating broad spectrum of their binding ability. it was suggested that both rspa and rspb were exposed on the cell surface of e. rhusiopathiae, as were the bacterial cells agglutinated by the anti-rspa immunoglobulin g (igg) and anti-rspb igg. rspa and rspb were present both in surface-antigen extracts and the culture supernatants of e. rhusiopathiae fujisawa-smr (serovar 1a) and se-9 (serovar 2). the recombinant rspa, but not rspb, elicited protection in mice against experimental challenge. these results suggest that rspa and rspb participate in initiation of biofilm formation through their binding abilities to abiotic and biotic surfaces.

AB  == in order to assess the epidemiological, microbiological, and clinical features of cellulitis and soft tissue infection occurring during the course of hiv disease,  clinical and laboratory data of 2221 hospitalizations carried out since 1991 were retrospectively examined, and 67 bacteriologically-proven episodes of cellulitis-soft tissue infection were identified (3.02% of overall admissions). among the 92 cultured pathogens, staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent (46  cases), followed by pseudomonas spp., escherichia coli, and streptococcus pyogenes; 38.1% of patients had a polymicrobial infection. i.v. drug use (p<.02)  and the male gender (p<.05), were significantly associated with the occurrence of these complications, while a great variation in the severity of underlying immunodeficiency was shown. an elevated rate (83.6%) of episodes of cellulitis or soft tissue infection were community-acquired in origin; the comprehensive frequency of these episodes significantly dropped during the highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart) era (p<.01). limbs were involved in over 80% of episodes, and an hematogenous dissemination of bacterial infection (which occurred in 25.4% of cases), proved significantly related to a cd4+ lymphocyte count <100 cells/microl (p<.03), and an absolute neutrophil count <1000 cells/microl (p<.05). s. aureus strains showed an elevated in vitro resistance rate to penicillin, ampicillin, and rifampin, and a 21.7% rate of methicillin-resistance, while among the 29 gram-negative microorganisms, resistance to ampicillin and first-generation cephalosporins, and that to amoxycillin-clavulanate and second-generation cephalosporin, occurred in over 90% and 60% of tested strains, respectively. all episodes of hiv-associated cellulitis and soft tissue infection were favorably treated in 5-16 days, in over 60% of cases with associated beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics; a recurrence of staphylococcal cellulitis occurred in 4 patients only, 6-17 months  after the initial episode. cellulitis and soft tissue infection are underestimated complications of hiv disease, but they have a broad etiological and clinical spectrum, are predominantly community-acquired, and are responsible  for an appreciable morbidity, due to the supporting role of i.v. drug addiction,  and the frequent hematogenous dissemination (which proved to be significantly related to the progression of immunodeficiency and underlying disease). the frequent polymicrobial etiology requires a combination antimicrobial therapy (to  be guided by in vitro susceptibility studies), which may avoid a complicated and  recurrent disease course in the great majority of cases.

AB  == objective: the present study was undertaken to investigate the target site penetration properties of fosfomycin, an antibiotic particularly suitable for treatment of soft tissue infections (stis) in critically ill patients. methods and results: the study population included nine patients with sepsis. penetration of fosfomycin into the interstitial space fluid of skeletal muscle was measured using the microdialysis technique, following a single intravenous administration  of 8.0 g of fosfomycin to patients. the median (range) fosfomycin area under the  concentration versus time profile for plasma and skeletal muscle were 673 (459-1108) and 477 (226-860) mg x h/l (p < 0.011), respectively. interstitial maximum concentrations were lower than plasma values (p < 0.029). median fosfomycin concentrations in the interstitium and plasma exceeded 70 mg/l throughout the observation period of 4 h and covered mics for streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. simulation of bacterial growth inhibition of s. pyogenes, based on tissue concentration data, confirmed the bactericidal properties of fosfomycin described in previous studies. conclusion: fosfomycin concentrations in muscle interstitium and plasma  exceeded the mics for a range of clinically relevant pathogens in critically ill  patients. thus, fosfomycin exhibits a tissue pharmacokinetic profile, which appears to offer an alternative to other broad-spectrum antibiotics in intensive  care patients suffering from sti.

TI  == factors associated with complications and mortality in adult patients hospitalized for infectious cellulitis.
AB  == the aim of this study was to analyze medical outcomes, including risks for complications and mortality, in 332 adult patients hospitalized for cellulitis. the infection was documented microbiologically in 128 cases (39%). staphylococcus aureus (46 cases) and streptococcus pyogenes (22 cases) were the most frequent causative pathogens. overall, 63 patients (19%) were discharged early (< or =4 days) and 166 patients (50%) were hospitalized for more than 4 days without developing any complications. one hundred three patients (31%) had one or more complications or died. of these, 78 required surgical debridement, 10 required plastic surgery, 7 underwent amputation, and 15 had shock on presentation. when comparing the three study groups (patients discharged early, patients hospitalized for < or =4 days without complications, and patients who developed 1 or more complication or who died), patients who were discharged early (low risk)  were more frequently female and were less likely to have multiple comorbid conditions, hypoalbuminemia, renal insufficiency, and/or cutaneous necrosis at presentation. overall mortality (<30 days) was 5% (16/332 patients). factors associated with death were male sex, presence of multiple comorbid conditions, congestive heart failure, morbid obesity, hypoalbuminemia, renal insufficiency, shock, and pseudomonas aeruginosa cellulitis. these findings can be used to stratify patients with acute cellulitis according to risks for complications and  mortality and may be helpful when deciding the most appropriate means of care, i.e. outpatient treatment or hospitalization.

TI  == bacterial aetiology of non-resolving otitis media in south african children.
AB  == little is known of the aetiology, serotypes or susceptibility of the pathogens causing non-resolving otitis media in children receiving care from specialists in private practice in developed or in developing countries. increased access to antibiotics in the community amongst children receiving such private care in south africa may be anticipated to lead to levels of resistance similar to those  found in countries with similar models of private practice, such as the united states. this study was conducted to determine the aetiology of non-resolving otitis media in south african children receiving private care and to determine the antimicrobial resistance patterns and serotypes of the bacterial isolates. middle-ear fluid was cultured from 173 children aged two months to seven years with non-resolving acute otitis media accompanied by persistent pain or fever who were referred to otorhinolaryngologists for drainage of middle-ear fluid within 14 days of the start of symptoms. while 92 per cent of the children had recently  received antibiotics and 54 per cent were currently receiving them, bacteria were isolated from 47 children (27 per cent). streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common pathogen (35), followed by haemophilus influenzae (nine), staphylococcus aureus (six), moraxella catarrhalis (two), streptococcus pyogenes (two) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (one). two isolates were identified in each of eight children. antimicrobial resistance to one or more antibiotics was found in 33/35  (94 per cent) of the pneumococci isolated, with resistance to penicillin in 86 per cent, resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in 54 per cent and to erythromycin and clindamycin in 69 per cent and 57 per cent, respectively. the pneumococcal serotypes found were 19f (28 per cent), 14 (26 per cent), 23f (23 per cent), 6b (nine per cent), 19a (87 per cent), and four (three per cent). children with a bacterial pathogen isolated were younger (mean age of 17 months)  than children from whom no bacteria were isolated (mean age of 23 months; p = 0.03). isolation of a pneumococcus was also significantly associated with younger age (mean = 16 months versus 22 months, p = 0.03), the presence of fever (or = 2.15, p = 0.049), and having one or more prior episodes of otitis media within the six months before tympanocentesis (or = 7.72, p = 0.03). almost all pneumococci isolated from non-resolving acute otitis media in this community are  antibiotic-resistant and should be considered especially in young children who have failed previous therapy and who have non-resolving pain or fever.

TI  == identification and characterization of a new ligand-binding site in fnbb, a fibronectin-binding adhesin from streptococcus dysgalactiae.
AB  == streptococcus dysgalactiae s2, a bovine mastitis isolate, expresses the fibronectin (fn)-binding adhesin fnbb. here, we describe a new fibronectin-binding domain called ufnbd, located 100 amino acid n-terminal to the primary repetitive fn-binding domain (fnbrd-b) of fnbb. ufnbd interacted with n-terminal region of fn (n29) and this binding was mostly mediated by type i module pair 2-3 of n29 fragment, whereas fnbrd-b mainly bound to type i module pair 4-5. furthermore, ufnbd inhibited adherence of s. dysgalactiae to fn but at  lower level as compared to fnbrd-b. ufnbd exclusively shared antigenic properties with the fn-binding unit du of fnbpa from staphylococcus aureus but not with ligand-binding domains or motifs of other adhesins, while fn-induced determinants of fnbrd-b and other adhesins appeared to be conformationally related. consistent with this, a monoclonal antibody 7e11 generated from a mouse immunized with fnbb, and that recognized ufnbd did not cross-react with fnbrd-b. the epitope for 7e11  was mapped to 40 amino acid long segment within ufnbd and interaction between the antibody and the epitope was specifically induced by fn or n29. a similar antibody epitope was observed in streptococcus pyogenes strains suggesting the presence of an adhesin bearing epitope related to fnbb.

TI  == staphylococcal and streptococcal superantigens: molecular, biological and clinical aspects.
AB  == superantigens (sags) include a class of certain bacterial and viral proteins exhibiting highly potent lymphocyte-transforming (mitogenic) activity towards human and or other mammalian t lymphocytes. unlike conventional antigens, sags bind to certain regions of major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class ii molecules of antigen-presenting cells (apcs) outside the classical antigen-binding groove and concomitantly bind in their native form to t cells at  specific motifs of the variable region of the beta chain (vbeta) of the t cell receptor (tcr). this interaction triggers the activation (proliferation) of the targeted t lymphocytes and leads to the in vivo or in vitro release of high amounts of various cytokines and other effectors by immune cells. each sag interacts specifically with a characteristic set of vbeta motifs. the review summarizes our current knowledge on s. aureus and s. pyogenes superantigen proteins. the repertoire of the staphylococcal and streptococcal sags comprises 24 and 8 proteins, respectively. the staphylococcal sags include (i) the classical enterotoxins a, b, c (and antigenic variants), d, e, and the recently discovered enterotoxins g to q, (ii) toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, (iii) exfoliatins a and b. the streptococcal sags include the classical pyrogenic exotoxins a and c and the newly identified pyrogenic toxins, g, h, i, j, smez, and ssa. the structural and genomic aspects of these toxins and their molecular relatedness are described as well as the available 3-d crystal structure of some  of them and that of certain of their complexes with mhc class ii molecules and the tcr, respectively. the pathophysiological properties and clinical disorders related to these sags are reviewed.

TI  == naturally occurring immune response against bacteria commonly involved in upper respiratory tract infections: analysis of the antigen-specific salivary iga levels.
AB  == lyophilized bacterial lysates, which actively stimulate the immune response, are  widely used as vaccines or 'biological response modifiers' in subjects with recurrent bacterial respiratory infections. since vaccines are indicated in the absence or in the presence of a weak constitutive immune response activity, a better knowledge on the 'naturally' occurring antibacterial immune response at the oropharingeal level should be helpful. a study was, therefore, designed to quantify the presence of salivary iga directed against surface antigens bacteria  frequently involved in the pathogenesis of upper respiratory tract infections: klebsiella pneumoniae (kp), staphylococcus aureus (sa), streptococcus pyogenes (spy), morraxella catarrhalis (mc), haemophylus influenzae (hi), and streptococcus pnumoniae (spn). in 34 volunteers (21 adults and 13 children), salivary fluid was collected and the presence of microorganism-specific iga antibodies evaluated by a novel enzyme immuno-assay. in the whole population only 29 and 24% of subjects had iga directed, respectively, to kp and sa, while the immune-response against other microbes was detectable in a small population ranging from 12 to 15% of all subjects studied. we found higher proportions of individuals with strain specific salivary iga in the adult than in the pediatric  population for all the microorganism evaluated. in addition, in children, the only strain inducing a significant production of specific iga at oropharingeal level was kp. interestingly, only ten out of 21 adults and two out 13 children have at least one significantly high antibody titer against one of the bacteria evaluated. nevertheless, when a group of healthy donors was treated with a polyvalent mechanical bacterial lysate (ismigen t.), the large majority developed a specific immune-response in the salivary fluid. these results are thus consistent with the good features of the novel enzyme-immunoassay and with a poor frequency of naturally induced specific anti-microbe antibodies in children and in adults despite the presence on recurrent respiratory infections in their clinical history.

TI  == molecular genetic analysis of a group a streptococcus operon encoding serum opacity factor and a novel fibronectin-binding protein, sfbx.
AB  == the group a streptococcus (gas) sof gene encodes the serum opacity factor protein, which is capable of opacifying mammalian sera and binding at least two host proteins, fibronectin and fibrinogen. the sof gene exists in approximately 50% of clinical isolates, and there is a classical association of so-called nephritogenic strains with the opacity factor-positive phenotype. in both a type  emm49 strain and a type emm12 strain, the sequences upstream of the 5' end of sof and downstream of the putative terminator were determined to be nearly identical  to a region in the m type 1 genome approximately 10 kb upstream of the emm1 gene. this close genetic linkage is likely reflected in the strict correlation of opacity factor phenotype with specific emm genotypes. a new fibronectin-binding protein gene, sfbx, was discovered immediately downstream of sof in emm12 and emm49 strains and in several other sof-positive strains. the sof and sfbx genes were found to be expressed on the same transcription unit, which was correlated with the putative promoter and rho-independant terminator sequences that flank these two genes. the sfbx genes from different emm types are predicted to encode  approximately 650-residue surface-bound proteins sharing 89 to 92% sequence identity. sfbx residues approximately 1 to 480 are not highly similar to those of other known proteins, with the closest match being the staphylococcus aureus coagulase protein. the remaining portions of these proteins (residues 481 to 650) contain four putative fibronectin-binding repeats highly similar to those of other streptococcal fibronectin-binding proteins and a potential lp(x)sg cell wall anchor motif. targeted in-frame allelic-exchange mutagenesis, complementation, and heterologous-expression studies found that serum opacification is encoded by sof alone and that sfbx encodes a fibronectin-binding function. a recombinant sfbx protein was found to bind immobilized fibronectin and to partially inhibit gas adherence to fibronectin. the sfbx gene was found to be present only in sof-positive strains, and together these genes could influence the spectrum of tissues colonized by sof-positive gas.

TI  == keratinocyte expression of human beta defensin 2 following bacterial infection: role in cutaneous host defense.
AB  == human beta defensin 2 (hbetad-2) is thought to play an important role in cutaneous immune defense. we hypothesized that (i) keratinocyte expression of hbetad-2, measured by reverse transcription-pcr, would be upregulated in response to challenge with pathogenic bacteria, particularly highly adherent strains of streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus, and (ii) hbetad-2 would have potent antimicrobial activity against pathogenic but not commensal organisms. expression of hbetad-2 was induced consistently by s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas strains of s.  pyogenes were poor and variable inducers of hbetad-2. no correlation was found between levels of bacterial adherence and keratinocyte expression of hbetad-2. s. pyogenes was significantly more sensitive to killing by hbetad-2 than s. epidermidis. we conclude that the ability to induce hbetad-2 expression in combination with sensitivity to its antimicrobial effects may contribute to the rarity of skin infections with the gram-negative bacterial organisms, whereas lack of stimulation of hbetad-2 expression by s. pyogenes may be important in its ability to evade innate defenses and cause skin disease. induction of expression  of hbetad-2 but relative tolerance to it may enable s. epidermidis to survive on  the skin surface and modulate hbetad-2 expression when the stratum corneum barrier is disrupted.

TI  == is antimicrobial resistance also subject to globalization?
AB  == in recent years one of the more alarming aspects of clinical microbiology has been the dramatic increase in the incidence of resistance to antibacterial agents among pathogens causing nosocomial as well as community-acquired infections. there are profound geographic differences in the incidence of resistance among pathogens of the respiratory tract, only some of which can be explained by the local use of antibiotics. a high percentage of moraxella catarrhalis strains produce beta-lactamase and are thus resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics. in contrast, beta-lactamase production among strains of haemophilus influenzae rarely reaches more than 30% around the world. methicillin-resistance in staphylococcus aureus is a common and increasing problem in hospitals but its extent varies both locally and nationally. resistance is usually associated with  the local spread of resistant strains. high standards of hygiene in hospitals can prevent the spread of such strains but once established they can be difficult to  eradicate. although streptococcus pyogenes remains highly susceptible to penicillins, even after many decades of their use, resistance to macrolides has occurred. this resistance can rise and fall. although the increase of macrolide resistance in s. pyogenes can often be associated with an increase in the use of  these drugs, this is not always so. in some cases it has been shown to be caused  by the spread of one or more resistant clones. eradication of these clones can reduce the level of resistance markedly. resistance to both macrolides and penicillins among strains of streptococcus pneumoniae is seen world-wide but is highly variable from country to country. local habits of drug usage may play a part. in italy, for example, there is preference for the use of parenteral third-generation cephalosporins for some severe infections and there is a corresponding low level of penicillin-resistance among pneumococci.

AB  == a spore-based biosensor for detecting low levels of bacteria in real-time has been recently developed. the system (termed lexsas, label-free exponential signal-amplification system) exploits spore's ability to produce fluorescence when sensing neighboring bacterial cells. we studied the lexsas as a possible approach for identifying bacterially contaminated platelet concentrates prior to  transfusion because the system offers rapid analysis, high sensitivity, and low cost. if successful, this approach could reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality from transfusion-related bacteremia and sepsis. in this study, we used  the lexsas for detecting bacteria in platelet concentrates spiked with bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, or streptococcus pyogenes. bacteria were separated from platelets using a 2-min procedure based on bacterial resistance to detergents and osmotic shock. the results indicate that the lexsas could be used to design a practical biosensor for identifying bacterially contaminated platelets in real-time.

TI  == [dependence of peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations on causative microorganisms able to produce superantigens].
AB  == a retrospective study of 176 immunologically tested patients admitted to kaunas medical university hospital during 1997-2000 was performed. all patients had positive bacteriological culture test result confirming an infectious etiology of the disease. our results showed that majority of immunological parameters were dependent on such non-specific factors as intensity and localization of the inflammatory process, an overall functional status of the patient, and the number of the disease exacerbation episodes during the last year before admission. in contrast to this, the absolute number of cd4 lymphocytes, the relative amount of  hla-dr positive lymphocytes and the index of neutrophil latex phagocytosis were exceptionally dependent on the species of the causative microorganism, in particular on superantigen producing cocci. in this case, the hla-dr positive lymphocyte amount and the neutrophil phagocytosis index were significantly higher. in addition, the cd4/cd8 lymphocyte ratio (the immunoregulatory index) was significantly lower in this group. as much as those findings are concordant with the signs of excessive immune activation, we conclude that they reflect a possible superantigenic action of the disease causing bacteria. therefore, a need for immunomodulating therapy during the infections caused by species able to produce superantigens is confirmed.

TI  == in vitro activity of ertapenem against common clinical isolates in relation to human pharmacokinetics.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ertapenem against bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with moderate to severe complicated intra-abdominal, complicated skin/skin structure, acute pelvic, or complicated urinary tract infection or community acquired pneumonia was compared to ceftriaxone and piperacillin-tazobactam and related to known plasma concentrations of the three agents. ertapenem was more potent against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus  aureus (mssa) than ceftriaxone and piperacillin-tazobactam and was more potent and more active than both of these agents against enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes. piperacillin-tazobactam was the most active agent against enterococci  and pseudomonas aeruginosa. all isolates of enterobacteriaceae (n=1088), streptococcus pyogenes (n=37), streptococcus agalactiae (n=48), mssa (n=187), haemophilus influenzae (n=59), and moraxella catarrhalis (n=9) were susceptible to ertapenem; < 1% of 1284 anaerobes and only 1 of 113 streptococcus pneumoniae (a penicillin-resistant isolate) were resistant to ertapenem. the mic value at which 90% of all enterobacteriaceae, streptococci, mssa, h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, and anaerobes were inhibited (mic90) was < or = 1 microg/ml and below the mean plasma concentration of total ertapenem following a 1 g intravenous infusion for at least 24 hours, i.e., the entire recommended dosing interval, and below the free drug concentration for at least 8 h.

AB  == in prepubertal girls with vaginal discharge, consideration of the etiology must be given to respiratory pathogens (streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and neisseria meningitidis), enteric pathogens (escherichia coli, shigella, and yersinia), poor hygiene, foreign body, nonabsorbent undergarments, irritants, vulvar skin disease, anatomic abnormalities (double vagina with fistula, pelvic abscess, and  ectopic ureter), and sexual abuse. prepubertal girls, outside the newborn period, with suspected gonococcal infection should be strongly considered to be victims of sexual abuse, once congenital and other newborn acquired forms of gonorrhea are excluded. we present a case of a three-year-old female with vaginal discharge and fever with a clouded social history, disproportionate distress on physical exam, and initial laboratory gram stain suggestive of gonococcus.

TI  == virulence factor expression by gram-positive cocci exposed to subinhibitory concentrations of linezolid.
AB  == linezolid is a new oxazolidinone with potent antibacterial activity against gram-positive cocci; it uniquely inhibits bacterial translation through inhibition of 70s initiation complex formation. the effects of sub-growth-inhibitory concentrations of linezolid on the expression of various structural and soluble virulence factors of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes were examined. for s. aureus, strains wood 46 and cowan 1  (nctc 8532) were used to measure protein a, coagulase, alpha-haemolysin (hla) and delta-haemolysin (hld). for s. pyogenes, strain nctc 9994 was used to measure m protein, streptolysin o (slo) and dnase. coagulase was assayed by clotting of citrated rabbit plasma, and hla, hld and slo by lysis of rabbit, human and horse  erythrocytes, respectively. protein a and m protein were measured indirectly using bacterial susceptibility to phagocytic ingestion of radiolabelled bacteria  by human neutrophils. when s. aureus was grown in 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 mic, linezolid, coagulase, hla and hld production were impaired. susceptibility to phagocytosis was changed by growth in the presence of 1/2 mic linezolid compared  with that in its absence (50.8 +/- 4.1% versus 38.9 +/- 2.9%; p <or= 0.05). when  s. pyogenes was grown in 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 mic linezolid, slo and dnase production were impaired compared with that of bacteria grown in the absence of the drug; its susceptibility to phagocytosis was also increased (52.8% bacteria ingested versus 37.5%; p <or= 0.05). a reduction in virulence factor expression at sub-mic linezolid concentrations may be of benefit in the treatment of gram-positive infections.

TI  == induction of platelet thrombi by bacteria and antibodies.
AB  == we have characterized 2 distinct mechanisms through which infectious agents may promote platelet adhesion and thrombus formation in flowing blood, thus contributing to the progression of disease. in one case, the process initiates when the integrin alpha(iib)beta(3) mediates platelet arrest onto immobilized bacterial constituents that have bound plasma fibrinogen. if blood contains antibodies against the bacteria, immunoglobulin (ig) g may cluster on the same surface and activate adherent platelets through the fc(gamma)riia receptor, leading to thrombus growth. as an alternative, bacteria that cannot bind fibrinogen may attach to substrates, such as immobilized plasma proteins or components of the extracellular matrix, which also support platelet adhesion. as  a result of this colocalization, igg bound to bacteria can activate neighboring platelets and induce thrombus growth regardless of their ability to initiate platelet-surface contact. our results demonstrate that intrinsic constituents of  infectious agents and host proteins play distinct but complementary roles in recruiting platelets into thrombi, possibly contributing to complications of acute and chronic infections.

TI  == intravitreal penetration of cefepime after systemic administration to humans.
AB  == purpose: to investigate the penetration of cefepime (a fourth-generation cephalosporin) into the vitreous after single-dose intravenous administration to  human subjects. methods: thirty phakic patients about to undergo vitreous surgery received 1 g (group 1, 15 patients) or 2 g cefepime (group 2, 15 patients) in a single intravenous injection before surgery. the indications for vitreous surgery were retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (24 patients), retinal detachment associated with giant retinal tear (4 patients), macular hole  (1 patient) and intraocular foreign body (1 patient). samples of vitreous and serum were obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 12 h after injection. three patients were used for each sampling time and for 1 g and 2 g of cefepime. samples were assayed for cefepime concentrations with high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). results: all the patients had detectable cefepime in their vitreous and serum measurable by hplc. the level of cefepime in the vitreous peaked at 2 h and reached a minimum at 12 h after intravenous injection in both groups. a mean peak vitreous level of cefepime was 1.91 +/- 0.13 microg/ml in group 1 and 2.86 +/- 0.37 microg/ml in group 2. the level of cefepime in the vitreous at 12 h after injection was 0.89 +/- 0.14 microg/ml in group 1 and 0.97 +/- 0.30 microg/ml in group 2. conclusion: the vitreous level of cefepime after intravenous injection was below the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic(90)) against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was over the mic(90) against proteus mirabilis, klebsiella spp., haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and enterobacter spp.

TI  == patterns of isolation of common gram positive bacterial pathogens and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents in jimma hospital.
AB  == gram positive bacteria are frequently emerging as antibiotic resistant pathogens, causing serious infections than ever before in the ill and debilitated patients.  the pattern of isolation and the antimicrobial susceptibilities of common gram positive cocci including staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (cons), streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus species and streptococcus pneumoniae was investigated between january 1997 and june 2000 in jimma hospital. of the 500 specimens collected from children and adults, 116 (23.2%) consisted of one or more of the above organisms. the following strains: staphylococcus aureus, 47 (40.5%), cons, 36 (31.0%), streptococcus pneumoniae, 26 (22.4%) streptococcus pyogenes, 5 (4.3%) and streptococcus faecalis, 2(1.7%) were isolated from different specimens including pus, sputum, urine, stool, blood and oro/nasopharyngeal swabs of patients. the in vitro activities of 14 different antibiotics including penicillin g, ampicillin, cloxacillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, kanamycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, streptomycin, methicillin, vancomycin and clindamycin was determined against the clinical bacterial isolates. the antimicrobial activities were evaluated by agar diffusion technique using mueller-hinton agar according to nccls recommendations. the majority of the pathogens, 59(50.9%) were recovered from upper respiratory tract infections and 17 (14.6%) from the lower respiratory tract. the resistance patterns of s. aureus, cons, s. pneumoniae and enterococci to penicillin was 91.5%, 94.4%, 7.7%  and 100% respectively. penicillin, ampicillin and cloxacillin showed low effects  (< 60%) on both s. aureus and cons. multi-drug resistance was observed in all the gram-positive isolates, especially higher in staphylococcus species. all isolates of s. aureus (100%) were susceptible to vancomycin, clindamycin and gentamicin. in order to reduce morbidity and mortality due to antibiotic resistance susceptibility testing should be performed for the proper management of bacterial infections. this entails the need for national surveillance to monitor antibiotic resistance in bacteria by susceptibility testing using reliable methods.

TI  == [interpretative reading of the antibiogram in gram-positive cocci].
AB  == resistance to methicillin in staphylococcus is related to expression of the gene  meca, and implies resistance to all beta-lactams. breakpoints for interpretation  of this mechanism differ in s. aureus and in coagulase-negative species. in relation to macrolides-lincosamides-streptograminsb, the most frequent mechanism  among resistant strains is expression of methylases (erm genes). topoisomerase changes caused by point mutations and expression of the efflux pump nora determine resistance to quinolones, but there are great differences on the activity of different compounds, which makes interpretative reading difficult. strains of s. aureus with intermediate susceptibility to glycopeptides (gisa strains) have been recently described. in spain, there is a high percentage of s. pneumoniae strains intermediate or resistant to penicillin, and a low percentage  of strains intermediate or resistant to third generation cephalosporins, because  of mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. the most frequent phenotype of resistance to macrolides in this species is caused by methylase production. resistance to quinolones is still uncommon, and is related to the mechanisms previously indicated for staphylococcus, but clinical interpretation of the antibiograma for this organism is even more complex. no strains of s. pyogenes resistant to penicillin have yet been described. in spain the most common phenotype of resistance to macrolides in s. pyogenes is determined by efflux pumps (mef genes), affecting 14- and 15-membered macrolides. e. faecalis is usually susceptible to ampicillin, in contrast to e. faecium. enterococci show intrinsic resistance to aminoglycosides, but still remain susceptible to the combination of these antimicrobials and cell-wall active agents. strains expressing different aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes became resistant to the combination. glycopeptide-resistant strains of enterococci are uncommon in our country, but several genotypes, of which vana is the most relevant from a clinical point of view, have been described in other regions.

TI  == randomized, double-blind, multicenter comparison of oral cefditoren 200 or 400 mg bid with either cefuroxime 250 mg bid or cefadroxil 500 mg bid for the treatment  of uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections.
AB  == background: uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections are commonly observed in medical practice. because these infections typically are confined to  the superficial layers and seldom lead to the destruction of skin structures and  resultant systemic dissemination, in general they can be treated with an oral antibiotic with potent microbiologic activity against gram-positive pathogens. objective: this paper compares the efficacy and tolerability of 3 beta-lactam antibiotics in patients with uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections. methods: two double-blind, multicenter, parallel-group studies were conducted, in which patients aged > or = 12 years with uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections were randomized to receive cefditoren 200 or 400 mg, cefuroxime 250 mg, or cefadroxil 500 mg, each bid for 10 days. study 1 compared cefditoren with  cefuroxime; study 2 compared cefditoren with cefadroxil. clinical and microbiologic responses were assessed at a posttreatment visit (within 48 hours of treatment completion) and test-of-cure visit (7-14 days after treatment completion). patients were monitored closely throughout the study with the use of physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, and assessment of adverse events. results: a total of 1,685 patients (855 males, 830 females; mean age, 41.1 years [range, 12-95 years]) were enrolled. within both studies, the 3 treatment groups were similar at baseline based on demographic characteristics and types of infection. cellulitis (26%), wound infection (25%), and simple abscess (15%) were the most common infections. clinical cure rates at the test-of-cure visit were 85% (443/523) for cefditoren 200 mg, 83% (427/516) for cefditoren 400 mg, 88% (234/265) for cefuroxime, and 85% (211/248) for cefadroxil. at the test-of-cure visit, cefditoren 200 mg had eradicated significantly fewer of the causative pathogens isolated before treatment in microbiologically evaluable patients than did cefuroxime in study 1 (p = 0.043) but significantly more of the pathogens than did cefadroxil in study 2 (p = 0.018). eradication rates for the most commonly isolated pathogens were generally similar in the 3 treatment groups in both studies, with the only significant difference favoring cefditoren 200 and 400 mg over cefadroxil for peptostreptococcus species in study 2 (p = 0.016 and p = 0.003, respectively). a  minority of patients (< or = 5% in any treatment group) discontinued study-drug treatment prematurely due to a treatment-related adverse event, with statistically higher rates for cefditoren 400 mg than for cefditoren 200 mg and the comparator cephalosporins (each p < 0.05). all 3 cephalosporins were generally well tolerated. most adverse events (>93%) were categorized as mild to  moderate, with the most common being diarrhea, nausea, and headache. conclusion:  in this population of patients with uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections, including those due to staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, the clinical cure rate and tolerability of cefditoren were comparable to those of cefuroxime and cefadroxil.

TI  == defense against biologic warfare with superantigen toxins.
AB  == background: superantigens produced by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes are among the most lethal of toxins. toxins in this family trigger an excessive cellular immune response leading to toxic shock. objectives: to design  an antagonist that is effective in vivo against a broad spectrum of superantigen  toxins. methods: short peptide antagonists were selected for their ability to inhibit superantigen-induced expression of human genes for cytokines that mediate shock. the ability of these peptides to protect mice against lethal toxin challenge was examined. results: antagonist peptide protected mice against lethal challenge with staphylococcal enterotoxin b and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, superantigens that share only 6% overall amino acid homology. moreover, it rescued mice undergoing toxic shock. antagonist peptides show homology to a beta-strand/hinge/alpha-helix domain that is structurally conserved among superantigens, yet remote from known binding sites for the major histocompatibility class ii molecule and t cell receptor that function in toxic t cell hyperactivation. conclusions: the lethal effect of superantigens can be blocked with a peptide antagonist that inhibits their action at the top of the toxicity cascade before activation of t cells occurs. superantigenic toxin antagonists may serve not only as countermeasures to biologic warfare but may be  useful in the treatment of staphylococcal and streptococcal toxic shock, as well  as in some cases of septic shock.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and  penicillins. fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa; n = 127), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa; n = 123), staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), enterococcus faecium (n = 50), enterococcus avium (n = 50), and peptostreptococcus spp. (p. anaerobius, p. asaccharolyticus, p. magnus, p. micros, p. prevotii; n = 125). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against mrsa and s. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against s. pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. however, the mic90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. increases in the mic90 against s. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), flomoxef (fmox), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and imipenem (ipm). increases in the mic90 against peptostreptococcus spp. were also  observed with ceftazidime (caz), cpr, cfpm, fmox, sbt/cpz, and ipm. the decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual mic range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. in conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. it, therefore, was suggested that czop had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.

TI  == expression of fibronectin-binding protein fbpa modulates adhesion in streptococcus gordonii.
AB  == fibronectin binding is considered to be an important virulence factor in streptococcal infections. adhesion of the oral bacterium streptococcus gordonii to immobilized forms of fibronectin is mediated, in part, by a high molecular mass wall-anchored protein designated csha. in this study, a second fibronectin-binding protein of s. gordonii is described that has been designated  as fbpa (62.7 kda). this protein, which is encoded by a gene located immediately  downstream of the csha gene, shows 85 and 81% identity to the fibronectin-binding proteins pava, of streptococcus pneumoniae, and fbp54, of streptococcus pyogenes, respectively. purified recombinant fbpa bound to immobilized human fibronectin in a dose-dependant manner, and isogenic mutants in which the fbpa gene was inactivated were impaired in their binding to fibronectin. this effect was apparent only for cells in the exponential phase of growth, and was associated with reduced surface hydrophobicity and the surface expression of csha. cells in  the stationary phase of growth were unaffected in their ability to bind to fibronectin. by utilizing gene promoter fusions with cat (encoding chloramphenicol o-acetyltransferase), it was demonstrated that csha expression was down-regulated during the exponential phase of growth in the fbpa mutant. expression of fbpa, but not csha, was sensitive to atmospheric o2 levels, and was found to be up-regulated in the presence of elevated o2 levels. the results suggest that fbpa plays a regulatory role in the modulation of csha expression and, thus, affects the adhesion of s. gordonii to fibronectin.

TI  == cefdinir: an advanced-generation, broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin.
AB  == background: cefdinir is an advanced-generation, broad-spectrum cephalosporin antimicrobial agent that has been approved for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, acute maxillary sinusitis, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, acute bacterial otitis media, and uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections in adult and pediatric patients. objective: the purpose of this article was to review the in vitro antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, safety, and potential role of cefdinir. methods: studies were identified by a medline search  (january 1983-september 2001) of the english-language medical literature, a review of identified articles and their bibliographies, and a review of data on file with the manufacturer. clinical efficacy data were selected from all published trials mentioning cefdinir. information concerning in vitro susceptibility, safety, chemistry, and the pharmacokinetic profile of cefdinir also was reviewed. results: cefdinir has a broad spectrum of activity against many gram-negative and gram-positive aerobic organisms, including streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. cefdinir is stable to hydrolysis by 13 of  the common beta-lactamases. it is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (mean time to peak plasma concentration, 3 hours) and is almost entirely eliminated via renal clearance of unchanged drug. the terminal disposition half-life of cefdinir is approximately 1.5 hours. efficacy has been demonstrated  in 19 clinical trials in adults and children with upper and lower respiratory tract infections (eg, pharyngitis, sinusitis, acute otitis media, acute bronchitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia), and skin and skin-structure infections. the adverse-event profile is similar to that of comparator agents, although in 4 adult and adolescent studies and 1 adult study, diarrhea occurred significantly more frequently in cefdinir recipients than in recipients of penicillin v, cephalexin, cefaclor, and cefprozil. conclusions: cefdinir is an alternative to other antimicrobial agents and can be dosed once or twice daily for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections. similar to other oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, cefdinir has  activity against common pathogens of the respiratory tract and skin and is stable in the presence of selected beta-lactamases. the clinical choice of an oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin will be based on patient acceptance, frequency of administration, and cost.

TI  == ceftriaxone activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated in us clinical microbiology laboratories from 1996 to 2000: results from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa.
AB  == ceftriaxone was introduced into clinical practice in the usa in 1985 and was the  first extended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporin approved for once-daily  treatment of patients with gram-positive or gram-negative infections. review of ceftriaxone activity is important given its continued use since the mid-1980s and reports of emerging resistance among all antimicrobial agent classes. we reviewed the activity of ceftriaxone and relevant comparative agents against five gram-positive and 11 gram-negative species for a 5-year period, 1996-2000, using  data from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa. all mic results were interpreted using nccls breakpoint criteria. ceftriaxone resistance among isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (n=17219) remained essentially unchanged over the 5 years studied and in fact was lower from 1998 to 2000 (5.0-5.1%) than  in 1996 (6.3%) and 1997 (6.6%). ceftriaxone resistance (range, 5.1-6.9%) among viridans group streptococci (n=6621) varied by <2% from 1997 to 2000. beta-lactam-resistant streptococcus pyogenes (n=935) and group b beta-haemolytic  streptococci (n=2267) were not identified in any year. among methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (n=39 284) ceftriaxone resistance was 0.1-0.3% per year from 1996 to 2000. ceftriaxone resistance among escherichia coli (n=472407; range, 0.2-0.4%), klebsiella oxytoca (n=16231; range, 3.5-4.8%),  klebsiella pneumoniae (n=117754; range, 1.9-2.6%), proteus mirabilis (n=67692; range, 0.2-0.3%), morganella morganii (n=11251; range, 0.3-2.1%) and serratia marcescens (n=26519; range, 1.6-3.8%) was low and consistent from 1996 to 2000. resistance to ceftriaxone among enterobacter cloacae (n=48114; range, 21.7-23.9%) was relatively high, compared with other enterobacteriaceae, but unchanged from 1996 to 2000. rates of resistance to ceftriaxone among acinetobacter spp. (n=20813) increased from 24.8% in 1996 to 45.1% in 2000. all haemophilus influenzae (n=7911) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (n=218) were susceptible to ceftriaxone, as were 99.7% of moraxella catarrhalis (n=312) tested in 1996 and 1997. in summary, ceftriaxone has retained its potent activity against the most commonly encountered gram-positive and gram-negative human pathogens despite widespread and ongoing clinical use for more than 15 years.

TI  == comparison of selection for mutants with reduced susceptibility to abt-773, erythromycin and rifampicin in respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  == attempts were made to select mutants on agar media containing the new ketolide abt-773, erythromycin or rifampicin, at concentrations above the mics, from staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae, including erythromycin-resistant strains. abt-773 did not select for mutants in four strains, whereas in eight strains the frequencies at 72 h were < or = 10(-9). abt-773 mics were 0.015-4 mg/l for mutants, except those selected from inducible erm(a) s. aureus. mutants selected on abt-773 or erythromycin were cross-resistant to abt-773, erythromycin and, sometimes, clindamycin. the susceptibility profiles indicate that different mutations were selected and that abt-773 and erythromycin may interact with the ribosome differently.

TI  == clinical judgment predicts culture results in upper respiratory tract infections.
AB  == background: we wanted to describe the natural history, familial transmission, microbiology, and accuracy of clinical judgment of potential pathogens of respiratory tract infections in a community family practice. methods: the study was a prospective case series in which consecutive patients requesting treatment  for respiratory tract infections were evaluated after nurse triage during 3 fall-spring months in a solo family practice in suburban cleveland, ohio. according to the physician's usual practice, patients were classified into high-, medium-, and low-risk groups for bacterial illness based on their clinical signs  and symptoms. cultures were performed and sensitivities were determined for pathogens from the infected throat, nasopharynx, conjunctiva, or other sites. patient symptoms and well-being were scored at the initial visit and at 3, 7 and  14 days later. results: there were 111 illness episodes in 86 patients; 94% had cultures taken, of which 38% grew a potentially pathogenic bacteria, most commonly group a streptococci, branhamella catarrhalis or staphylococcus aureus.  the physician's judgment of bacterial infection was associated (p < .001) with having a positive culture (sensitivity 53%, specificity 78%, positive and negative predictive values 60% and 73%, respectively). a positive culture was associated with 2 of 16 signs or symptoms: purulent discharge from any site or a  red swollen eye. there was no association of treatment status with clinical outcomes during 2 weeks of follow-up observation. conclusion: infection with a potentially pathogenic bacteria is difficult to determine solely by clinical signs and symptoms, but clinical judgment is associated with positive culture results. the effect of selective treatment of upper respiratory tract infection based on clinical signs and symptoms and patient and family culture results remains to be determined, but using clinical judgment could result in more selective antibiotic use than found in current practice patterns.

TI  == biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  == the calgary biofilm device (cbd) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (mbec) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin g, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine  for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the cbd under selected conditions. the biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. biofilms composed of arcanobacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hyicus, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium renale, or corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but  as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. biofilm and planktonic streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. planktonic escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and  trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against e. coli growing as a biofilm. salmonella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. planktonic and biofilm pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. the cbd provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.

TI  == skin and soft tissue infection.
AB  == abstract. normal skin is heavily colonized by bacterial flora. the most common are the various nonpathogenic gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus epidermidis (coagulase-negative). skin and soft tissue infections are usually caused by staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and streptococcus pyogenes. this article discusses common and some not so common bacterial skin infections, including impetigo, folliculitis, furncles and carbuncles, cellulitis and erysipelas, gangrenous cellulitis, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome and scarlet fever. impetigo and ecthyma are common bacterial infections of the skin commonly caused by s. aureus and / or group a streptoccus. in mild and localized  impetigo topical antibiotics whereas in widespread or severe one and in ecthyma systemic antibiotics like, cloxacillin, erythromycin, azithromycin or cephalexin  should be used. folliculitis, furunculosis and carbuncle are folliculocentric infections caused by s. aureus involving the variable depth and extent of the follicle(s) and surrounding tissue. these conditions can be treated with topical  or systemic antibiotics like cloxacillin, cephalexin, erythromycin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or vancomycin. staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome is a toxin mediated exfoliative dermatosis caused by s. aureus of phase group ii. intravenous penicillinase-resistant anti-staphylococcal antibiotics like methicillin, cloxacillin, cephalosporin or erythromycin are required. erysipelas  and cellulitis are acute infections of dermal and subcutaneous tissues caused most frequently by group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (erysipelas) or s. aureus  requiring systemic antibiotics like oral or intravenous penicillin, erythromycin, cephalexin, cloxacillin, vacomycin, minocycline or ciprofloxacin depending upon the severity, suspected causative organism and culture/sensitivity results. gangrenous cellulitis is characterized by infection with necrosis of skin and underlying subcutaneous tissue due to various pathogens occurring at different site. ampicillin, gentamicin, and either metronidazole or clindamycin intravenously in standard doses are recommended for the treatment.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--i. gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial sensitivity for czop were  also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen  species (1,913 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa; n = 178), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa; n = 199), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse; n = 98), methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis (mrse; n = 164), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 72), staphylococcus saprophyticus (n = 28), enterococcus faecalis (n = 206), enterococcus faecium (n  = 91), enterococcus avium (n = 72), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 133), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 138), penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp; n = 133), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp; n = 100), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp; n = 29), streptococcus milleri group (n = 135) and peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 137). czop possessed comparable antibacterial activities against mssa and msse to other cephems, and was also effective on mrse but not on mrsa. an antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than other cephems. czop, however, did not indicate an antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus, just like other cephems. an antibacterial activity of czop against e. faecalis was comparable to cefpirome (cpr) and higher than other cephems. no antibacterial activity of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, just like other drugs. an antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as that of cefotiam (ctm), cefepime (cfpm) and cpr, and that against s. agalactiae was also preferable. czop and other cephems also had a preferable antibacterial activity against s. milleri group that was most sensitive to benzylpenicillin. an antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than that of cefazolin, ctm and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated with breakpoint mic of czop was 96.5% in mrsa, 93.1% in prsp, 60.0% in  pisp, 40.3% in s. haemolyticus, 22.3% in e. faecalis, and 15.9% in mrse. those resistance ratios were similar to those for cfpm, but e. faecalis showed 90.8% resistance for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against this species. in conclusion, no remarkable annual change in the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria was observed. the sensitivities of pisp and prsp to czop, however, was suggested to be decreasing.

TI  == epidemiology and microbiology of cellulitis and bacterial soft tissue infection during hiv disease: a 10-year survey.
AB  == background: cellulitis and soft tissue infection are underestimated complications of hiv disease. patients and methods: sixty-seven bacteriologically proven consecutive episodes were identified among 2221 hiv-infected patients hospitalized in a 10-year period, and assessed according to several epidemiological, microbiological and clinical variables. results: staphylococcus  aureus was the most frequently cultured pathogen (50% of 92 isolates), followed by pseudomonas spp., escherichia coli and streptococcus pyogenes; a polymicrobial infection was present in 38.1% of episodes. drug addiction (p < 0.003) and male gender (p < 0.04) were significantly associated with the occurrence of these complications, which were community-acquired in 83.6% of cases. while a remarkable variation in the severity of underlying immunodeficiency was shown, hematogenous dissemination occurred in 25.4% of episodes, and proved significantly related to a low cd4+ lymphocyte count, and neutropenia. a 21.7% methicillin-resistance rate was shown among s. aureus isolates. all episodes were favorably treated in 5-16 days, in over 60% of cases with associated beta-lactam-aminglycoside antibiotics; a recurrence of staphylococcal cellulitis  occurred in four patients only. conclusion: skin and soft tissue infections are continuing causes of morbidity in hiv-infected patients, even in the highly active antiretroviral therapy era.

TI  == superantigens: microbial agents that corrupt immunity.
AB  == microbial superantigens are a family of protein exotoxins that share the ability  to trigger excessive and aberrant activation of t cells. the best characterised are the staphylococcal enterotoxins and the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins that trigger the staphylococcal and streptococcal toxic shock syndromes. it is now apparent that superantigens have a wider role in the pathology of infectious  diseases than has previously been appreciated. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes together produce 19 different superantigens. the range of  microorganisms known to produce superantigens has expanded to include gram negative bacteria, mycoplasma, and viruses. research is beginning to shed light on the more subtle parts these molecules play in causing disease and to produce some real possibilities for specific treatment of superantigen-induced toxicity.  we aim to highlight these new developments and review the science behind these fascinating molecules.

TI  == skin microflora and bacterial infections of the skin.
AB  == the skin is a milieu for controlled bacterial growth. skin supports the growth of commensal bacteria, which protect the host from pathogenic bacteria. environmental and local factors, host immunity, and organism adherence and virulence are intricately related to cutaneous infection. resident gram-positive  bacteria include staphylococcus, micrococcus, and corynebacterium sp. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes are notoriously pathogenic in the skin. in order for bacteria to be pathogenic, they must be able to adhere to, grow on, and invade the host. bacteria possess numerous virulence genes that allow for growth in these privileged niches. epidermal infections caused by s. aureus and s. pyogenes include impetigo and ecthyma. dermal infections consist of erysipelas, cellulitis, and necrotizing fasciitis. the pilosebaceous unit is involved in folliculitis, furunculosis, and carbunculosis. moreover, s. aureus and s. pyogenes produce toxins that may elicit a superantigen response, causing massive release of cytokines. staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, toxic shock syndrome, and scarlet fever are all superantigen-mediated. gram-negative organisms such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, pasteurella multocida, capnocytophaga canimorsus, bartonella sp., klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, and vibrio vulnificus are not typical resident skin microflora but may cause cutaneous infection.

TI  == differential recognition of surface proteins in streptococcus pyogenes by two sortase gene homologs.
AB  == the interaction of streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus [gas]) with its  human host requires several surface proteins. in this study, we isolated mutations in a gene required for the surface localization of protein f by transposon mutagenesis of the m6 strain jrs4. this gene (srta) encodes a protein  homologous to staphylococcus aureus sortase, which covalently links proteins containing an lpxtg motif to the cell wall. the gas srta mutant was defective in  anchoring the lpxtg-containing proteins m6, protein f, scpa, and grab to the cell surface. this phenotype was complemented when a wild-type srta gene was provided  in trans. the surface localization of t6, however, was unaffected by the srta mutation. the m1 genome sequence contains a second open reading frame with a motif characteristic of sortase proteins. inactivation of this gene (designated srtb) in strain jrs4 affected the surface localization of t6 but not m6, protein  f, scpa, or grab. this phenotype was complemented by srtb in trans. an srta probe hybridized with dna from all gas strains tested (m types 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 18, 22, and 50 and nontypeable strain 64/14) and from streptococcal groups c and g, while srtb hybridized with dna from only a few gas strains. we conclude that srta and srtb encode sortase enzymes required for anchoring different subsets of proteins  to the cell wall. it seems likely that the multiple sortase homologs in the genomes of other gram-positive bacteria have a similar substrate-specific role.

TI  == killing of gram-positive cocci by fatty acids and monoglycerides.
AB  == the susceptibilities of three gram-positive cocci to medium-chain saturated and long-chain unsaturated fatty acids and their one-monoglycerides were studied. the bacteria were incubated with equal volumes of lipid solutions for 10 min. lauric  acid, palmitoleic acid and monocaprin reduced the number of cfu by 6.0 log10 or greater at 5 mm concentration for streptococci of group a (gas) and group b (gbs). when further compared at lower concentrations and after longer incubation  time monocaprin proved to be the most active. capric acid showed the highest activity against staphylococcus aureus at 10 mm. however, at lower concentrations monocaprin was the only lipid that showed significant activity against s. aureus. the mode of action of monocaprin against gbs was studied by a novel two-color fluorescent assay of bacterial viability and by electron microscopy. the results  indicate that the bacteria are killed by disintegration of the cell membrane by the lipid, leaving the bacterial cell wall intact. the highly lethal effect of monocaprin indicates that this lipid might be useful as a microbicidal agent for  prevention and treatment of infections caused by these bacteria.

TI  == comparison of in vitro activities of abt-773 and telithromycin against macrolide-susceptible and -resistant streptococci and staphylococci.
AB  == the activity of a new ketolide, abt-773, was compared to the activity of the ketolide telithromycin (hmr-3647) against over 600 gram-positive clinical isolates, including 356 streptococcus pneumoniae, 167 staphylococcus aureus, and  136 streptococcus pyogenes isolates. macrolide-susceptible isolates as well as macrolide-resistant isolates with ribosomal methylase (erm), macrolide efflux (mef), and ribosomal mutations were tested using the nccls reference broth microdilution method. both compounds were extremely active against macrolide-susceptible isolates, with the minimum inhibitory concentrations at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited (mic90s) for susceptible streptococci and staphylococci ranging from 0.002 to 0.03 microg/ml for abt-773 and 0.008 to 0.06 microg/ml for telithromycin. abt-773 had increased activities against macrolide-resistant s. pneumoniae (erm mic90, 0.015 microg/ml; mef mic90, 0.12 microg/ml) compared to those of telithromycin (erm mic90, 0.12 microg/ml; mef mic90, 1 microg/ml). both compounds were active against strains with rrna or  ribosomal protein mutations (mic90, 0.12 microg/ml). abt-773 was also more active against macrolide-resistant s. pyogenes (abt-773 erm mic90, 0.5 microg/ml; abt-773 mef mic90, 0.12 microg/ml; telithromycin erm mic90, >8 microg/ml; telithromycin mef mic90, 1.0 microg/ml). both compounds lacked activity against constitutive macrolide-resistant staphylococcus aureus but had good activities against inducibly resistant staphylococcus aureus (abt-773 mic90, 0.06 microg/ml; telithromycin mic90, 0.5 microg/ml). abt-773 has superior activity against macrolide-resistant streptococci compared to that of telithromycin.

TI  == [current therapeutical management, new antibiotics and treatment of pseudomonas aeruginosa in bacterial ent-infections].
AB  == in bacterial infections of the sinuses and the middle ear streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and staphylococcus aureus are most frequently isolated, whereas in tonsillopharyngitis streptococcus pyogenes is the most important pathogen. s. aureus is found in up to 40 % in acute and chronic sinusitis and causes severe complications in otitis media, therefore antibiotics used as empirical initial treatment should also be effective against this pathogen. to decrease duration of illness and to avoid serious complications antibiotic treatment of bacterial ent-infections is necessary. the new ketolides and the third and fourth generation quinolones are very effective and the second generation cephalosporins like cefuroxime axetil have proven excellent clinical and bacteriological efficacy in numerous clinical  trials combined with an excellent resistance pattern over the years. efficacy of  short course therapy (5 days) in sinusitis and tonsillopharyngitis has been proven in clinical trials and is cost saving. in more severe infections treated in hospital sequential i. v./oral therapy offers pharmaco-economical benefits. both regimen demonstrate cost savings while maintaining high clinical efficacy. in more severe infections like otitis externa diffusa, otitis externa maligna, otitis media chronica and perichondritis pseudomonas aeruginosa is a dangerous pathogen that has to be covered by initial antibiotic treatment. ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime are widely used and effective. ciprofloxacin resistance has increased, while ceftazidime susceptibility is unchanged (> 90 %). a dose reduction study with ceftazidime in severe ent-infections showed equivocal efficacy between 3 x 1 g and 3 x 2 g daily that offers a cost benefit of 50 %.

TI  == cefditoren pivoxil.
AB  == cefditoren pivoxil is an orally absorbed prodrug that is rapidly hydrolysed by intestinal esterases to the microbiologically active cephalosporin cefditoren. cefditoren has a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including common respiratory and skin pathogens. cefditoren has shown excellent in vitro activity against the gram-positive pathogens penicillin-susceptible and -intermediate streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus. cefditoren was inactive against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. of the important gram-negative  pathogens, cefditoren had potent antibacterial effects against beta-lactamase-positive and -negative haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae and beta-lactamase-positive and -negative moraxella catarrhalis. cefditoren does  not have antibacterial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa or atypical respiratory pathogens and has only variable activity against anaerobes. in healthy volunteers, single doses of cefditoren pivoxil 200 and 400mg achieved maximal plasma concentrations of 2.6 to 3.1 mg/l and 3.8 to 4.6 mg/l, respectively. cefditoren penetrates rapidly into bronchopulmonary and tonsillar tissue as well as inflammatory and noninflammatory blister fluid. in two, randomised, double-blind trials involving patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (aecb), cefditoren 200 and 400mg twice daily for 10 days produced clinical cure rates of 88 to 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. clinical cure rates in patients with aecb were similar to those of either clarithromycin 500mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg twice daily. in patients with streptococcal pharyngitis, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200mg twice daily produced clinical cure rates of 94% at 4 to 7 days after treatment, which were similar to those observed for phenoxymethylpenicillin potassium 250 mg four times daily. in uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200 or 400mg twice daily produced the same clinical cure rate of 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. these cefditoren pivoxil dosage regimens were as effective as a 10-day course of either cefadroxil 500 mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg  twice daily in treating uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, including those caused by s. aureus and s. pyogenes. the most common adverse events associated with therapeutic doses of cefditoren pivoxil are diarrhoea, nausea, headache, abdominal pain and vaginal candidiasis.

TI  == cow- and quarter-level risk factors for streptococcus uberis and staphylococcus aureus mastitis.
AB  == this study was designed to identify risk factors for intramammary infections with streptococcus uberis and staphylococcus aureus under field conditions. an 18-mo survey with sampling of all quarters of all lactating cows at 3-wk intervals was  carried out in three dutch dairy herds with medium bulk milk somatic cell count (200,000 to 300,000 cells/ml). quarter milk samples were used for bacteriology and somatic cell counting. data on parity, lactation stage, and bovine herpesvirus 4-serology were recorded for each animal. during the last year of the study, body condition score, and teat-end callosity scores were recorded at 3-wk  intervals. a total of 93 new infections with strep. uberis were detected in 22,665 observations on quarters at risk for strep. uberis infection, and 100 new  infections with staph. aureus were detected in 22,593 observations on quarters at risk for staph. aureus infection. multivariable poisson regression analysis with  clustering at herd and cow level was used to identify risk factors for infection. rate of infection with strep. uberis was lower in first- and second-parity cows than in older cows, and depended on stage of lactation in one herd. quarters that were infected with arcanobacterium pyogenes or enterococci, quarters that had recovered from strep. uberis- or staph. aureus-infection in the past, and quarters that were exposed to another strep. uberis infected quarter in the same  cow had a higher rate of strep. uberis infection. teat-end callosity and infection with coagulase-negative staphylococci or corynebacteria were not significant as risk factors. rate of staph. aureus infection was higher in bovine herpesvirus 4-seropositive cows, in right quarters, in quarters that had recovered from staph. aureus or strep. uberis infection, in quarters exposed to other staph. aureus infected quarters in the same cow, and in quarters with extremely callused teat ends. infection with coagulase-negative staphylococci was not significant as a risk factor. the effect of infection with corynebacteria on  rate of infection with staph. aureus depended on herd, stage of lactation, and teat-end roughness. herd level prevalence of strep. uberis or staph. aureus, and  low quarter milk somatic cell count were not associated with an increased rate of infection for strep. uberis or staph. aureus.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of cefditoren against respiratory pathogens isolated from children in japan.
AB  == there is an increasing spread and incidence of penicillin-resistant bacteria that are becoming less susceptible to commonly prescribed oral antimicrobials, including extended-spectrum cephalosporins. against this background, we undertook this study to determine the prevalence of penicillin resistance in streptococcus  pneumoniae and the in-vitro activity of oral antimitrobials. between april 1996 and december 1997, in 245 children with respiratory tract infections (bronchitis  in 61, pharyngitis in 115, and tonsillitis in 69), 119 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 89 strains of streptococcus pyogenes, 61 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 36 strains of staphylococcus aureus, and 34 strains of moraxella catarrhalis were isolated from the pharynx. the antimicrobial susceptibility of these isolates was assessed by a broth microdilution method. the isolation incidence of penicillin-intermediately resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp) and penicillin-highly resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) was 59.0% and 13.1%, respectively. most strains of pisp and prsp were highly resistant to cefaclor, cefpodoxime, cefteram, cefdinir, clarithromycin, ampicillin, and minocycline, but susceptibile to ofloxacin and cefditoren (cdtr). the in-vitro activity of cdtr was superior to that of other cephalosporins, such as cefaclor, cefdinir, and cefpodoxime, when tested against both the beta-lactamase-positive and -negative h. influenzae isolated. cdtr was also active against all the other strains, including methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, s. pyogenes, and m. catarrhalis. this  study suggested that cdtr was a useful oral antibiotic for pediatric respiratory  tract infections.

TI  == characterization of streptococcus suis genes encoding proteins homologous to sortase of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == many surface proteins which are covalently linked to the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria have a consensus c-terminal motif, leu-pro-x-thr-gly (lpxtg). this sequence is cleaved, and the processed protein is attached to an amino group of a cross-bridge in the peptidoglycan by a specific enzyme called sortase. using the type strain of streptococcus suis, nctc 10234, we found five genes encoding proteins that were homologous to sortases of other bacteria and determined the nucleotide sequences of the genetic regions. one gene, designated  srta, was linked to gyra, as were the sortase and sortase-like genes of other streptococci. three genes, designated srtb, srtc, and srtd, were tandemly clustered in a different location, where there were three segments of directly repeated sequences of approximately 110 bp in close vicinity. the remaining gene, designated srte, was located separately on the chromosome with a pseudogene which may encode a transposase. the deduced amino acid sequences of the five srt proteins showed 18 to 31% identity with the sortases of streptococcus gordonii and staphylococcus aureus, except that srta of s. suis had 65% identity with that of s. gordonii. isogenic mutants deficient for srta, srtbcd, or srte were generated by allelic exchanges. the protein fraction which was released from partially purified cell walls by digestion with n-acetylmuramidase was profiled by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. more than 15 of the protein spots were missing in the profile of the srta mutant compared with that of the parent strain, and this phenotype was completely complemented by srta cloned from s. suis. four genes encoding proteins corresponding to such spots were identified and sequenced. the deduced translational products of the four genes possessed the lpxtg motif in their c-terminal regions. on the other hand, the protein spots that were missing in the srta mutant appeared in the profiles of the srtbcd and srte mutants. these results provide evidence that the cell wall sorting system involving srta is also present in s. suis.

AB  == a new sample preparation method was developed for fresh, whole-cell gram-positive bacteria to be analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi tof ms). with fresh, whole-cell gram-negative bacteria of the enterobacteriaceae family, we had previously achieved spectra consisting of >50 peaks and mass ranges of 2-25 kda. because similar spectral quantity could not be achieved for gram-positive bacteria, using this same protocol, we investigated an alternative approach that focuses on the thick peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall. gram-positive bacteria were incubated with 0.05-0.5 mg/ml lysozyme for 30 min prior to being analyzed by maldi tof ms.  lysozyme is an enzymatically stable, 14-kda protein that specifically cleaves between peptidoglycan disaccharide subunits. a significant increase in overall number of peaks (>50) in the 2-14 kda range was observed without interference from the presence of lysozyme. we show that for four different species (staphylococcus aureus, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, and s. agalactiae) reproducible subset of peaks were found within spectra from a reference strain and two unrelated clinical isolates. the data suggests that this sample preparation may be useful for increasing the overall number of peaks within spectra for subsequent development of bacterial identification strategies.

TI  == ertapenem: a new carbapenem.
AB  == ertapenem is a new 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase, which binds preferable to penicillin-binding proteins (pbp) 2 and 3. ertapenem has a broad antibacterial spectrum with mic90 values < 0.5 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella spp., serratia spp.,  proteus spp., clostridium perfringens, fusobacterium spp. peptostreptococcus spp. and anaerobic streptococcus spp. ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action as shown by time-killing curves and exhibits a short pae of 1.4 - 2.6 h against the gram-positive strains but no pae against gram-negative strains. in an infection model in mice, it has been shown that ertapenem and imipenem were highly efficacious at a level of 2 mg/kg in bacterial clearance in comparison to  ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefotaxime and meropenem. in comparison to other available carbapenems, ertapenem has a long half-life of 4.5 h and is developed as a single daily dose carbapenem. the protein binding is dose-dependent and is estimated to 94% at concentrations under 100 mg/l and approximately 85% at 300 mg/l. cmax after a dose of 1 g in healthy volunteers has been estimated to 190 mg/l. given the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, it may be predicted that ertapenem will have an effect on most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. for pathogens with a mic of 0.5 mg/l, the estimated t > mic will be 50% (of 24 h) and for pathogens with a mic of 1 mg/l 31%. for anaerobic bacteria with mic values between 1-2 mg/l, the t > mic may not be sufficient for bacterial eradication. however, clinical trials have to confirm this hypothesis.

TI  == structural and functional role of threonine 112 in a superantigen staphylococcus  aureus enterotoxin b.
AB  == bacterial superantigens are potent t-cell stimulatory protein molecules produced  by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. their superantigenic activity can be attributed to their ability to cross-link major histocompatibility complex class ii molecules with t-cell receptors (tcrs) to form a tri-molecular complex. each superantigen is known to interact with a specific v(beta) element of tcr. staphylococcal enterotoxin b (seb, a superantigen), a primary cause of food poisoning, is also responsible for a significant percentage of non-menstrual associated toxic shock syndrome in patients with a variety of staphylococcal infections. structural studies have elucidated a binding cavity on the toxin molecule essential for tcr binding. to understand the crucial residues involved in binding, mutagenesis analysis was performed. our analysis suggest that mutation of a conserved residue thr(112) to  ser (t112s) in the binding cavity induces a selective reduction in the affinity for binding one tcr v(beta) family and can be attributed to the structural differences in the native and mutant toxins. we present a detailed comparison of  the mutant structure determined at 2.0 a with the previously reported native seb  and seb-tcr v(beta) complex structures.

AB  == in infection by streptococcus pyogenes, fibronectin (fn)-binding proteins play important roles as adhesins and invasins. here, we present a novel fn-binding protein of s. pyogenes that exhibits a low similarity to other fn-binding proteins reported. after searching the oklahoma streptococcal genome sequencing database for open reading frames (orfs) with an lpxtg motif, nine orfs were found among those recognized as putative surface proteins, and one of them was designated as fba. the fba gene was found in m types 1, 2, 4, 22, 28 and 49 of s. pyogenes, but not in other serotypes or groups of streptococci. fba, a 37.8 kda protein, possesses three or four proline-rich repeat domains and exhibits a high  homology to fnbpa, the fn-binding protein of staphylococcus aureus. recombinant fba exhibited a strong binding ability to fn. in addition, fba-deficient mutants  showed diminished invasive capabilities to hep-2 cells and low mortality in mice  following skin infection. the fba gene was located downstream of the mga regulon  and analysis using an mga-inactivated mutant revealed that it was transcribed under the control of the mga regulator. these results indicate that fba is a novel protein and one of the important virulence factors of s. pyogenes.

TI  == [clinical significance of the streptococcus milleri group in peritonsillar abscesses].
AB  == few researchers have microbiologically studied peritonsillar abscesses in detail, and their results have been conflicting. although streptococcus pyogenes (group a beta-streptococcus) is commonly considered an important pathogen in this infection, recent studies have demonstrated the recovery of many other streptococci mainly consisting of alpha-streptococci. few studies have identified these streptococci at the species level, however. we studied details of bacteriology in 31 cases of peritonsillar abscess treated between 1991 and 2000.  the streptococcus milleri group was most frequently isolated (25.8%), followed by eikenella corrodens (9.7%), staphylococcus aureus (6.5%), and s. pyogenes (3.2%). the s. milleri group, consisting of 3 species of streptococcus constellatus, s. intermedius, and s. anginosus, forms part of the normal flora most commonly found in the mouth, throat, gastrointestinal tract, and genital tract. these species have become known as an important pathogen in abscess disease but little attention has been paid to their role in peritonsillar abscesses. to adequately culture the s. milleri group, incubation in air containing carbon dioxide or in an anaerobic condition is required, and then the differentiation of the 3 species requires the biochemical reactivity tests. since hemolytic patterns of the s. milleri group vary, we studied the population of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-hemolytic strains among 36 strains of this group. we found 32 (88.8%) to be alpha-hemolytic. although not all alpha-hemolytic strains belong to the s. milleri group, a considerable number of this group could be missed among alpha-streptococci isolated from the peritonsillar abscess. as antibiotics began  being used widely, normal flora such as the s. milleri group may have become an important pathogen in peritonsillar abscesses due to an imbalance between organisms and host defense.

TI  == administration of superantigens protects mice from lethal listeria monocytogenes  infection by enhancing cytotoxic t cells.
AB  == superantigens stimulate t-cell-receptor vbeta-selective t-cell proliferation accompanying the release of cytokines, which may eventually protect the host from microbial infections. we investigated here whether superantigens can rescue the host from lethal bacterial infection. mice were pretreated with staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin b (seb) 1 and 2 days before bacterial infection, and the mortality of infected mice was assessed. seb pretreatment protected mice from lethal infection with listeria monocytogenes but not from lethal infection with streptococcus pyogenes. this enhanced protection was also observed upon pretreatment with recombinant streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin a. furthermore, l. monocytogenes-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity (dth) due to type 1 helper t (th1) cells and the cytotoxicity of cd8(+) t cells were significantly enhanced after seb administration and bacterial infection. depletion of either cd4(+) t cells or cd8(+) t cells in seb-pretreated mice completely abolished this protection. this phenomenon was ascribed to the elimination of l. monocytogenes-specific cd8(+) cytotoxic t lymphocytes (ctl). it was found that cd4(+) t cells contributed to the induction of the ctl populations. furthermore,  seb pretreatment of heat-killed l. monocytogenes-immunized mice enhanced the protection from challenge of l. monocytogenes. taken together, these results indicated that administrations of superantigens protected mice from infection with l. monocytogenes, which was dependent on the enhanced l. monocytogenes-specific ctl activity in the presence of cd4(+) t cells, and superantigens exhibited adjuvant activity in the immunization against intracellular pathogens.

TI  == an observational study on the epidemiology of respiratory tract bacterial pathogens and their susceptibility to four injectable beta-lactam antibiotics: piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone.
AB  == bacterial infections of the respiratory tract account for a large proportion of total medical consultations in general practice. in recent years, antibiotic resistance has increased alarmingly in a number of bacterial species that are common causes of these infections. the aim of this observational study was to determine the antibiotic resistance of microbial agents isolated from patients with acute or acutely exacerbated respiratory infections. subjects recruited as potential sources of bacteria were either outpatients seen in a number of specialized clinics and hospital practices, or hospitalized patients. overall, 648 consecutive patients (67% male, mean age 48.1+/-27.0 years) with infection of the upper or lower respiratory tract were observed during a 13-month period. a total of 551 pathogenic microbial strains were isolated and tested for their in vitro susceptibility to piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone. among all isolates, the four most frequent pathogens were pseudomonas aeruginosa (132 isolates, 24%), streptococcus pyogenes (99 isolates,  18%), staphylococcus aureus (93 isolates, 17%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (46 isolates, 8%). the susceptibility of gram-positive isolates ranged from 97.5% to  95.1%, and no remarkable difference was found in the antibacterial activity of tested b-lactam antibiotics. the susceptibility of gram-negative isolates to piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam was also similar: 96.5% and 97.1%, respectively. in contrast, differences were found between piperacillin (or piperacillin/tazobactam) and either ceftazidime (p=0.003) or ceftriaxone (p<0.0003) in gram-negative isolates. we conclude that, despite the extensive use of beta-lactam antibiotics (piperacillin, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone) in medical practice during the past three decades, the susceptibility of the most common pathogens involved in the etiology of upper and lower respiratory tract infections to these antibiotics is still high. in particular, bacterial resistance developed by gram-positive organisms against piperacillin is negligible and not alarming.

TI  == [clinical aspects of streptococcal and staphylococcal toxinic diseases].
AB  == staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes produce a lot of toxins, some of them responsible for specific diseases. staphylococcal food poisoning is due to ingestion of enterotoxin containing food. seven toxins have been isolated so far. generalized exfoliative syndrome is related to exfoliatin. young children are particularly affected. the disease consists in a cutaneous exfoliation usually limited with a favourable outcome. the mucus membranes are not involved. the nose or pharynx are the most usual portal of entry. staphylococcus aureus is not grown from the bullae. severe extensive forms have been observed particularly in neonates (ritter's disease). bullous impetigo is also due to exfoliatin. it consists in the presence of a restricted number of cloudy bullae, from which staphylococcus can be grown. it is a mild disease with a favourable outcome within a few days. scarlet fever is related to the streptococcal erythrogenic toxins. the classic form of the disease is presently rare. this disease may be related to staphylococcus as a complication of arthritis, osteomyelitis or wound  super-infection. bacteremia is usual. staphylococcal scarlet fever is not related to exfoliatin as previously believed, but to enterotoxins or tsst-1, so it seems  to be an abortive form of toxic shock syndrome. toxic shock syndrome is defined as a multi organ failure syndrome with a rapid onset, fever, rash followed by desquamation, vomiting and diarrhea, hypotension, conjunctivitis and strawberry tongue. the disease is related to an infection or colonisation with a toxin (tsst-1) producing strain of staphylococcus aureus. enterotoxins (mainly c) may be involved. the disease may occur in childhood, sometimes after superinfection of varicella. the mortality is low (5%) and mainly due to ards or cardiac problems. erythrogenic toxins produced by streptococcus pyogenes are involved in  a streptococcal form of toxic shock syndrome with a quite similar presentation. in most cases however, a cutaneous or soft tissue infection is at the origin. necrotizing fasciitis complicating varicella is a classic cause in children. bacteremia is often observed. the mortality rate is as high as 60%. the streptococcal strains involved in north america use to produce the toxin erythrogenic a, the european cases seem to be more related to strains secreting the b toxin with a dysregulation of the mechanisms which control the secretion of the toxin. staphylococcus strains producing the panton and valentine leucocidin are responsible for chronic or relapsing furonculosis and above all for a very severe necrotizing pneumonia observed in children and young adults presenting as  an acute respiratory distress syndrome with leucopenia, hemoptysis and shock carrying a heavy mortality rate. besides these specific diseases, staphylococcal  and streptococcal toxins may be involved in some syndromes of unknown origin, in  which the intervention of superantigens seems very likely. kawasaki syndrome is among them as strains producing staphylococcal and streptococcal toxins have been grown from patients with kawasaki syndrome. in the same way, the intervention of  toxins is suspected in the determination of sudden infant death syndrome and atopic eczema.

TI  == an in vitro study of antibacterial properties of the cervical mucus plug in pregnancy.
AB  == objective: to evaluate whether cervical mucus plugs are antibacterial in vitro. study design: cervical mucus plugs from 56 healthy women in labor were studied by 2 different antimicrobial assays: (1) analysis of the inhibition by the cervical  mucus plug of several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by overlaying the  cervical mucus plug onto an agar plate with imbedded bacteria, and (2) determination of the antibacterial property of the cervical mucus plug material by radial diffusion assay with group b streptococcus and escherichia coli. results: in the agar overlay assay, there was complete inhibition of clinical isolates of staphylococcus saprophyticus, e coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa and  patient-variable partial-to-complete inhibition of enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus agalactiae. in the radial diffusion assay, cervical mucus plugs had activity toward group b streptococcus equivalent to 0.075 microg/ml of gentamicin and toward e coli equivalent to 0.5 microg/ml of gentamicin. conclusion: a low-molecular substance  with antibacterial activity in the cervical mucus plug may protect the fetus against ascending infections.

TI  == lactobacillus casei acquires the binding activity to fibronectin by the expression of the fibronectin binding domain of streptococcus pyogenes on the cell surface.
AB  == fibronectin binding domain was expressed on the cell surface of lactobacillus casei strain shirota which hardly adheres to fibronectin. dna for the fibronectin binding domain of the sfbl gene, which encodes a fibronectin binding protein of streptococcus pyogenes atcc 21059, was amplified with polymerase chain reaction,  cloned into a surface display vector psak332, and introduced into l. casei. the fibronectin binding domain was expressed as a fusion protein consisting of staphylokinase of staphylococcus aureus and the anchor sequence of cell wall-associated 763 proteinase of lactococcus lactis ncdo 763. the fibronectin binding ability of the resulting l. casei was confirmed with western blot analysis, immunoelectron microscopic analysis, and adherence to fibroblast cells. these results indicate that l. casei has acquired a new phenotype to bind fibronectin upon the expression of the fibronectin binding domain on the cell surface. this l. casei also shows binding affinity to fibrinogen, indicating that fibronectin binding domain is involved in the binding to fibrinogen as well.

TI  == toxic shock syndrome and bacterial superantigens: an update.
AB  == toxic shock syndrome (tss) is an acute onset illness characterized by fever, rash formation, and hypotension that can lead to multiple organ failure and lethal shock, as well as desquamation in patients that recover. the disease is caused by bacterial superantigens (sags) secreted from staphylococcus aureus and group a streptococci. sags bypass normal antigen presentation by binding to class ii major histocompatibility complex molecules on antigen-presenting cells and to specific variable regions on the beta-chain of the t-cell antigen receptor. through this interaction, sags activate t cells at orders of magnitude above antigen-specific activation, resulting in massive cytokine release that is believed to be responsible for the most severe features of tss. this review focuses on clinical and epidemiological aspects of tss, as well as important developments in the genetics, biochemistry, immunology, and structural biology of sags. from the evolutionary relationships between these important toxins, we propose that there are five distinct groups of sags.

TI  == a simple model host for identifying gram-positive virulence factors.
AB  == we demonstrate the use of the nematode caenorhabditis elegans as a facile and inexpensive model host for several gram-positive human bacterial pathogens. enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus, but not bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecium, or streptococcus pyogenes, kill adult c. elegans. focusing our studies on the enterococcal species, we found that both e. faecalis and e. faecium kill c. elegans eggs and hatchlings, although only e. faecalis kills the adults. in the case of adults, a low inoculum of e. faecalis grows to a high titer in the c. elegans intestine, resulting in a persistent infection that cannot be eradicated by prolonged feeding on e. faecium. interestingly, a high titer of e. faecium also accumulates in the nematode gut, but does not affect the longevity of the worms. two e. faecalis virulence-related factors that play an important role in mammalian models of infection, fsr, a putative quorum-sensing system, and cytolysin, are also important for nematode killing. we exploit the apparent parallels between gram-positive infection in simple and more complex organisms by using the nematode to identify an e. faecalis virulence factor, scrb, which is relevant to  mammalian pathogenesis.

TI  == microbiological profile of telithromycin, the first ketolide antimicrobial.
AB  == telithromycin, the first of the ketolide antimicrobials, has been specifically designed to provide potent activity against common and atypical/intracellular or  cell-associated respiratory pathogens, including those that are resistant to beta-lactams and/or macrolide-lincosamide-streptograminb (mls(b)) antimicrobials. against gram-positive cocci, telithromycin possesses more potent activity in vitro and in vivo than the macrolides clarithromycin and azithromycin. it retains its activity against erm-(mls(b)) or mef-mediated macrolide-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes and against staphylococcus aureus resistant to macrolides through inducible mls(b) mechanisms. telithromycin also possesses high activity against the gram-negative pathogens haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, regardless of beta-lactamase production. in vitro, it shows similar activity to azithromycin against h. influenzae, while in  vivo its activity against h. influenzae is higher than that of azithromycin. telithromycin's spectrum of activity also extends to the atypical, intracellular  and cell-associated pathogens legionella pneumophila, mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydia pneumoniae. in vitro, telithromycin does not induce mls(b) resistance and it shows low potential to select for resistance or cross-resistance to other  antimicrobials. these characteristics indicate that telithromycin will have an important clinical role in the empirical treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections.

TI  == conserved degp protease in gram-positive bacteria is essential for thermal and oxidative tolerance and full virulence in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the degp protease, a multifunctional chaperone and protease, has been shown to be essential for virulence in gram-negative pathogens such as salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, brucella abortus, yersinia enterocolitica, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the function of degp in pathogenesis appears to be the degradation of damaged proteins that accumulate as a result of the initial host response to infection, which includes the release of reactive oxygen intermediates. additionally, the degp protease plays a major role in monitoring and maintaining  the escherichia coli periplasm and influences e. coli pilus biogenesis. we report here the identification of highly homologous enzymes in streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the phenotype of an insertionally inactivated degp allele in s. pyogenes is similar to that reported for e. coli, with temperature sensitivity for growth and enhanced sensitivity to reactive oxygen intermediates. virulence studies in a mouse model of streptococcal infection indicate that a functional degp protease is required for full virulence. these results suggest degp as an attractive broad-spectrum target for future anti-infective drug development.

AB  == azithromycin (zithromac), a 15-membered ring macrolide antibacterial agent, was approved to be manufactured in japan in march 2000. it showed good in vitro and/or in vivo antibacterial activities against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, peptostreptococcus micros, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydia pneumoniae. its activity against h. influenzae was particularly more potent than that of currently used macrolide antibacterial agents. after oral administration to patients, azithromycin was readily absorbed and became widely distributed throughout the body, achieving higher concentrations in tissues and phagocytic cells than in serum or plasma. its distribution into phagocytes was as high as more than 10 times that of erythromycin, and azithromycin was readily released from phagocytes in the presence of s. aureus. in experimentally infected mice, the concentration of azithromycin was higher in infected tissues than in uninfected tissues, which indicated that azithromycin was selectively delivered to infected tissues by migrating phagocytes. these pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties were reflected in good clinical results for the treatment of respiratory infections and other infections with once daily dosing for 3 days.

TI  == superantigen antagonist blocks th1 cytokine gene induction and lethal shock.
AB  == bacterial superantigens trigger an excessive, th1-cytokine response leading to toxic shock. we designed a peptide antagonist that inhibits seb-induced expression of human genes for il-2, ifn-gamma, and tnf-beta, cytokines that mediate shock. the peptide antagonist shows homology to a beta-strand-hinge-alpha-helix domain that is conserved structurally in superantigens produced by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes yet remote from known binding sites for the major histocompatibility class ii molecule and t-cell receptor. for th1-cell activation, superantigens depend on this domain. the peptide protected mice against lethal challenge with seb or sea. moreover, it rescued mice undergoing toxic shock. surviving mice rapidly developed broad-spectrum, protective immunity, which rendered them resistant to further lethal challenges with different staphylococcal and streptococcal superantigens. thus, the lethal effect of superantigens, mediated by th1 cytokines, can be blocked with a peptide antagonist that inhibits their action at the top of the toxicity cascade, before activation of t cells takes place.

TI  == the influence of plasma on the disinfecting activity of the new antimicrobial agent n-chlorotaurine-sodium in comparison with chloramine t.
AB  == the phenomenon of increasing bactericidal activity of n-chlorotaurine in the presence of chlorine-consuming material has been investigated both on a chemical-analytical and microbiological basis using plasma as substrate and chloramine t for comparison. chlorine consumption assessed by iodometric titration showed a biphasic time-course with a very fast loss of oxidation capacity within one minute (n-chlorotaurine: -9.3%, chloramine t: -16.8%) followed by a slow loss which could still be detected after 24 h (total loss -61.7% and -74.1%, respectively). killing curves revealed that an increase in bactericidal activity, in spite of improved consumption, did not occur with all strains, and could be detected only at a certain degree of consumption. escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed the most pronounced effect, streptococcus pyogenes and proteus mirabilis a medium-sized one, while it was absent in staphylococcus aureus. with chloramine t, an increase in bactericidal activity could not be proved. the chemical basis of these consumption effects can be reduced to four reaction types: oxidation of thiols; chlorine substitution of  activated c-h compounds; transhalogenation; and hydrolytic degradation of n-chloro-alpha-amino acids and -peptides emerging by transhalogenation. the initial fast loss of oxidation capacity can be attributed mainly to oxidation of  thiols, while the subsequent slower decrease is caused by the other types of reaction. the increase in bactericidal activity, on the other hand, can be explained by transhalogenation, leading to the formation of more bactericidal n-chloro compounds by which the loss of n-chlorotaurine is over-compensated.

TI  == antibacterial activity of essential oils and their major constituents against respiratory tract pathogens by gaseous contact.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of 14 essential oils and their major constituents in the gaseous state was evaluated against haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus. for most essential  oils examined, h. influenzae was most susceptible, followed by s. pneumoniae and  s. pyogenes, and then s. aureus. penicillin-susceptible and -resistant s. pneumoniae were comparable in susceptibility. escherichia coli, which was used as a control, showed least susceptibility. a minimal inhibitory dose (mid) was introduced as a measure of the vapour activity. among 14 essential oils, cinnamon bark, lemon-grass and thyme oils showed the lowest mid, followed by essential oils containing terpene alcohols as major constituents. the essential oils containing terpene ketone, ether and, in particular, hydrocarbon had high mids. the vapour activity on short exposure was comparable to that following overnight  exposure, and rapid evaporation was more effective than slow evaporation of essential oils. the vapour concentration and absorption into agar of essential oils reached a maximum 1 or 2 h after rapid evaporation. these results indicate that the antibacterial action of essential oils was most effective when at high vapour concentration for a short time.

TI  == [cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis: microbiology and pathogenesis].
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes is a common cause of necrotizing cutaneous infections in otherwise healthy children and adults. several surface components are involved in the processes of adherence and invasiveness, such as protein m and capsulae. streptolysin o and other bacterial products, such as pyrogenic exotoxins, are involved in tissue injury and necrosis. toxins a and c act as superantigens and are expressed by strains associated with the toxic shock syndrome. staphylococcus aureus, alone or in association with streptococci, is also commonly isolated form all body sites, but bacteremia is inconstant. capsule, protein a, and the staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome toxin are the major pathogenicity factors. in infections of the face and the neck, the predominant anaerobes recovered in association with group a streptococci are peptostreptococcus magnus, oral prevotella, porphyromonas spp., and fusobacterium spp. bacteroides fragilis, clostridium, enterobacteria, and enterococci are recovered in infections located  next to the perineal area. penicillin is the drug of choice for the treatment of  streptococcal infections. however benzylpenicillin may be not sufficient for severe infections and large inoculum, therefore the administration of clindamycin or another inhibitor of protein synthesis is recommended. since the infection may be polymicrobial, the initial therapy should include treatment for staphylococci  and anaerobes. in some cases broad- spectrum antibiotics also, effective on enterobacteria, are needed. the efficacy of appropriate parenteral antibiotics, however, depends on the prompt and aggressive exploration and debridement of suspected deep-seated infection, and supportive care of shock and multiple organ  failure.

TI  == linezolid: an oxazolidinone antimicrobial agent.
AB  == background: linezolid is the first oxazolidinone anti-infective agent marketed in the united states. it is indicated for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia, complicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by methicillin-sensitive or methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and other susceptible organisms, and  vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infections. it also is indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by methicillin-sensitive s. aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, and community-acquired pneumonia caused by penicillin-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae. objective: this article reviews the pharmacologic properties and clinical usefulness of linezolid. methods: using the terms linezolid, pnu-100766, and oxazolidinone, we  performed a literature search of the following databases: medline (1966 to september 2000), healthstar (1993 to september 2000), iowa drug information service (1966 to september 2000), international pharmaceutical abstracts (1970 to september 2000), pharmaprojects (january 2000 version), and meeting abstracts of  the infectious diseases society of america and the interscience conference on antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy (1996 to 2000). results: linezolid has a unique structure and mechanism of action, which targets protein synthesis at an exceedingly early stage. consequently, cross-resistance with other commercially available antimicrobial agents is unlikely. it is primarily effective against gram-positive bacteria. to date, resistance to linezolid has been reported in patients infected with enterococci. the pharmacokinetic parameters of linezolid in adults are not altered by hepatic or renal function, age, or sex to an extent  requiring dose adjustment. linezolid is metabolized via morpholine ring oxidation, which is independent of the cytochrome p450 (cyp450) enzyme system; as a result, linezolid is unlikely to interact with medications that stimulate or inhibit cyp450 enzymes. compassionate-use trials and other clinical studies involving mainly adult hospitalized patients with gram-positive infections have shown that linezolid administered intravenously or orally is effective in a variety of nosocomial and community-acquired infections, including those caused by resistant gram-positive organisms. reported adverse effects include thrombocytopenia. diarrhea, headache, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, constipation, rash, and dizziness. preliminary pharmacoeconomic data indicate that a significantly higher percentage of patients receiving linezolid therapy versus comparator could be discharged from the hospital by day 7 (p = 0.005). conclusions: linezolid appears to be effective while maintaining an acceptable tolerability profile. due to the risk of bacterial resistance, linezolid should be reserved for the treatment of documented serious vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections.

TI  == evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  == background: approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. the time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. study design and methods: isolates  of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus viridans were inoculated into day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 cfu per ml (2 units/organism). each bag was sampled 10 times (20 ml/sample). four ml of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 ml was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 ml into thioglycollate broth. results: with the exception of p. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. a range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. a mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 cfu/ml inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of p. acnes in anaerobic bottles. conclusion: bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 cfu per ml. p. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). however, p. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination.  such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet  storage.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of acidified nitrite on dermatophyte fungi, candida and bacterial skin pathogens.
AB  == aims: nitric oxide is generated from sweat nitrite in the acidic environment of the skin surface and is thought to contribute to protection against infection. this study examined the sensitivity of trichophyton mentagrophytes, t. rubrum, candida albicans, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus and propionibacterium acnes to acidified nitrite. methods and results: organisms were cultured in varying concentrations of nitrite and ph for different lengths of time, before being transferred to recovery medium. with the exception of strep. pyogenes, addition of nitrite increased the antimicrobial activity of acid solutions against all organisms tested. the rank order of sensitivity was: c. albicans < t. rubrum < t. mentagrophytes < staph. aureus < p. acnes, with p. acnes being most sensitive. conclusion: this work has shown that acidified nitrite is microbiocidal to common cutaneous pathogens. the concentrations of nitrite required to kill pathogenic fungi and bacteria in in vitro assays were higher than the concentrations of nitrite measured in sweat. however, additional  co-factors in vivo and in sweat may potentiate the effect of acidified nitrite. significance and impact of the study: pharmacological preparations of acidified nitrite are novel antimicrobial agents. these data suggest skin organisms which may be sensitive to this treatment.

TI  == rho is not essential for viability or virulence in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == we have identified the gene for transcription termination factor rho in staphylococcus aureus. deletion of rho in s. aureus reveals that it is not essential for viability or virulence. we also searched the available bacterial genomic sequences for homologs of rho and found that it is broadly distributed and highly conserved. exceptions include streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus  pyogenes, mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma pneumoniae, ureaplasma urealyticum, and synechocystis sp. strain pcc6803, all of which appear not to possess a rho homolog. complementation studies indicate that s. aureus rho possesses the same activity as escherichia coli rho and that the rho inhibitor bicyclomycin is active against s. aureus rho. our results explain the lack of activity of bicyclomycin against many gram-positive bacteria and raise the possibility that the essentiality of rho may be the exception rather than the rule.

AB  == objective: to review the antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and tolerability of cefdinir, an expanded-spectrum oral cephalosporin.  data sources: literature was identified by a medline search (january 1983-november 1999) of the medical literature, review of english-language literature and bibliographies of these articles, and product information. study selection: clinical efficacy data were selected from all published trials mentioning cefdinir. additional information concerning in vitro susceptibility, safety, chemistry, and pharmacokinetic profile of cefdinir was also reviewed. data synthesis: cefdinir, an oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin, has a broad spectrum of activity against many gram-negative and -positive aerobic organisms,  including streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. cefdinir is stable to hydrolysis by many common beta-lactamases. cefdinir is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is primarily eliminated via renal clearance of unchanged drug. the terminal disposition half-life of cefdinir is approximately 1.5 hours. efficacy has been demonstrated in a number of clinical trials in adults and children with upper and lower respiratory tract infections (e.g., pharyngitis, sinusitis, acute otitis media, acute bronchitis, acute exacerbation  of chronic bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia) and skin and skin-structure  infections. the adverse event profile is similar to that of comparator agents. conclusions: cefdinir is a second-line alternative to first-line antimicrobial agents, with convenient once- or twice-daily dosing in the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections. similar to other oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, cefdinir has activity against common pathogens of the respiratory tract and skin and is stable in the presence of many beta-lactamases. the clinical choice of an oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin will be based on patient acceptance, frequency of administration, and cost.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and policy in belgium.
AB  == antibiotic resistance is increasing worldwide, also in belgium. a few examples to illustrate this problem: s. pneumoniae are becoming increasingly resistant to penicillin and erythromycin; resistance of s. pyogenes to erythromycin is increasing year-by-year; salmonella and campylobacter are becoming more and more  resistant to the fluoroquinolones. in hospitals, the problem of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus appears to be decreasing, but two clones of ceftazidime-resistant enterobacter aerogenes are spreading throughout the belgian hospitals. antibiotic resistance has become a serious health care issue both in hospitals and in the community. the popular press has termed some of the multiresistant organisms "killer bugs" or "superbugs". infection with such organisms has been associated with treatment failures, higher morbidity and mortality and increased costs. in this paper, we will review the problems of antibiotic resistance in the community setting. we will briefly discuss those pathogens with important consequences of morbidity and mortality in the community, such as: streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, neisseria meningitidis, the enteric pathogens salmonella and campylobacter, and the urinary tract pathogen e. coli. this resistance has in response to various conditions and opportunities, such as: clustering and overcrowding, increased number of immunodeficient patients, increased elderly population, population mobility, increased use of (broad-spectrum) antibiotics, over-the-counter sale and self-dosing with antibiotics, inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions and lack of  compliance, fewer resources for education and infection control, decreased funding for public health surveillance. in belgium, we should be able to develop, implement and evaluate a good antibiotic policy. our country has a wealth of information on antibiotic consumption in hospitals and the community. this information has been used for benchmarking of antibiotic consumption in hospitals. a unique system for reimbursement of prophylactic use of antibiotics in surgery was developed which resulted in a more adequate use of antibiotics. however, a policy should not be limited to the human ecosystem. therefore, a coordination commission for antibiotic policy was installed recently by the ministers of social affairs, public health and agriculture.

TI  == the antibacterial activity of tea in vitro and in vivo (in patients with impetigo contagiosa).
AB  == a total number of 104 patients with impetigo contagiosa was included in this study. they were 47 females (45.2%) and 57 males (54.8%). their ages ranged from  one month to 40 years with a median of 4 years. this study was divided into two parts: part i (in vitro): thirty-five patients were swabbed to determine the microbiology of impetigo contagiosa which included 33 isolates of pure s. aureus  (94.3%) and 2 of a combination of s. aureus and streptococcus pyogenes (5.7%). the antibacterial effect of tea liquor (lotion) against s. aureus proved very effective. antibiotic sensitivity was done for all bacterial isolates of s. aureus. part ii (in vivo): the antibacterial effects of tea liquor and ointment were tested by treating 64 patients with impetigo contagiosa. tea ointment was very effective with a cure rate of 81.3%. forty patients were taken as controls and divided into two groups. the first one was given an ointment containing framycetin and gramicidin (soframycin) with a cure rate of 72.2%; the other group was given oral cephalexin with a cure rate of 78.6%. to the best of our knowledge, this study was the first one which demonstrated the anti-bacterial action of crude tea in vivo, against impetigo contagiosa. clinical data about impetigo are also included in this study.

AB  == an outbreak of pseudobacteremia due to streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococci [gas]) and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) was  traced to the venting procedure for aerobic bottles prior to their loading into the incubator of the bact/alert analyzer (organon teknika). bacteria shed by a laboratory worker suffering from impetigo and cellulitis contaminated the aerobic bottles of 10 patients. all blood culture isolates, in addition to the isolates from the laboratory worker, were of the same gas m and t types. all mssa isolates from blood cultures and the index case's hands had the same lytic phage profile.  procedural breakdowns were identified in the laboratory. bottles were vented outside the biological safety cabinet, gloves were not worn, and unprotected needles were used for the venting procedure. the source of the aspirated bacteria that contaminated the bottles was identified and the index case was treated promptly.

TI  == group a streptococcal growth phase-associated virulence factor regulation by a novel operon (fas) with homologies to two-component-type regulators requires a small rna molecule.
AB  == a novel growth phase-associated two-component-type regulator, fas (fibronectin/fibrinogen binding/haemolytic activity/streptokinase regulator), of  streptococcus pyogenes was identified in the m1 genome sequence, based on homologies to the histidine protein kinase (hpk) and response regulator (rr) part of the staphylococcus aureus agr and streptococcus pneumoniae com quorum-sensing  systems. the fas operon, present in all 12 tested m serotypes, was transcribed as polycystronic message (fasbca) and contained genes encoding two potential hpks (fasb and fasc) and one rr (fasa). downstream of fasbca, we identified a small 300 nucleotide monocistronic transcript, designated fasx, that did not appear to  encode true peptide sequences. measurements of luciferase promoter fusions revealed a growth phase-associated transcription of fasbca and fasx, with peak activities during the late exponential phase. insertional mutagenesis disrupting  fasbca and fasa led to a phenotype similar to agr-null mutations in s. aureus, with prolonged expression of extracellular matrix protein-binding adhesins and reduced expression of secreted virulence factors such as streptokinase and streptolysin s. in addition, fasx transcription was dependent on the rr fasa; however, deletion mutagenesis of fasx resulted in a similar phenotype to that of  the fasbca or fasa mutants. complementation of the fasx deletion mutant, with the fasx gene expressed in trans from a plasmid, restored the wild-type fasbca regulation pattern. this strongly suggested that fasx, a putative non-translated  rna, is the main effector molecule of the fas regulon. however, using spent culture supernatants from wild-type and fas mutant strains, we were not able to show an influence on the logarithmic growth phase expression of fas and dependent genes. thus, despite structural and functional similarities between fas and agr,  to date the fas operon appears not to be involved in group a streptococcal (gas)  quorum-sensing regulation.

TI  == recombination within natural populations of pathogenic bacteria: short-term empirical estimates and long-term phylogenetic consequences.
AB  == the identification of clones within bacterial populations is often taken as evidence for a low rate of recombination, but the validity of this inference is rarely examined. we have used statistical tests of congruence between gene trees  to examine the extent and significance of recombination in six bacterial pathogens. for neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus, the congruence between the maximum likelihood trees reconstructed using seven house-keeping genes was in most cases  no better than that between each tree and trees of random topology. the lack of congruence between gene trees in these four species, which include both naturally transformable and nontransformable species, is in three cases supported by high ratios of recombination to point mutation during clonal diversification (estimates of this parameter were not possible for strep. pyogenes). in contrast, gene trees constructed for hemophilus influenzae and pathogenic isolates of escherichia coli showed a higher degree of congruence, suggesting lower rates of  recombination. the impact of recombination therefore varies between bacterial species but in many species is sufficient to obliterate the phylogenetic signal in gene trees.

TI  == structural evidence for the evolution of pyrogenic toxin superantigens.
AB  == pathogenic bacteria have evolved a wide variety of toxins to invade and attack host organisms. in particular, strains of the bacteria staphylococcus aureus and  streptococcus pyogenes produce a family of pyrogenic toxin superantigens (ptsags) that can cause illness, e.g., toxic shock syndrome, or synergize with a number of other immune system disorders. the ptsags are all similar in size and have a conserved two-domain tertiary fold despite minimal amino acid sequence identity.  the tertiary structure of ptsag domain 1 is similar to the immunoglobulin binding motif of streptococcal proteins g and l. ptsag domain 2 resembles members of the  oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide binding fold family that includes the b subunits  of the ab(5) heat-labile enterotoxins, cholera toxin, pertussis toxin, and verotoxin. the strong structural homology between the pyrogenic toxins and other  bacterial proteins suggests that the ptsags evolved through the recombination of  two smaller beta-strand motifs.

TI  == a century of the synthesis of dapsone: its anti-infective capacity now and then.
AB  == background: although dapsone was first synthesized in 1908, a quarter of a century was to pass before it was used in the treatment of bacterial infections.  dapsone was, however, too toxic for humans (because of the excess dosage which was administered at that time) and was thus considered to be of no value in the treatment of common bacterial infections. since the early 1950s, dapsone has been recognized as being uniquely effective against a number of noninfectious, inflammatory diseases and, today, this is its main indication. thus, the reason why dapsone was first introduced into medicine, namely the treatment of bacterial infections, has been set aside and its main current applications are the treatment of noninfectious, inflammatory, autoimmune, and bullous diseases. objective: to study the anti-infective capacity of dapsone against common bacterial infections. as many patients who receive dapsone for the treatment of noninfectious, inflammatory diseases have a concomitant bacterial infection or a  superinfection of their skin disease, we thought that, if dapsone proved to be effective against common bacterial infections, it may obviate the need for an additional antimicrobial drug in these patients. methods: three bacterial atcc> strains (streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli) were tested by a macrodilution minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) test for dapsone. dapsone concentrations were between 0.06 and 1125 microg/ml. results: even the highest concentration of dapsone of 1125 microg/ml did not inhibit bacterial growth. conclusions: our results indicate that dapsone has no antibacterial effects whatsoever. even at very high concentrations, it does not suppress the growth of most susceptible strains of bacteria. the story of dapsone (i.e. the long time that elapsed between its synthesis to its use for the chemotherapy of infectious diseases) will not repeat itself this time.

TI  == evidence for the involvement of bacterial superantigens in psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and kawasaki syndrome.
AB  == a growing body of evidence implicates streptococcal and staphylococcal superantigens in the development of psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and kawasaki syndrome. in each of these illnesses, an abnormal state of immunologic activity is observed. superantigens, which have a unique ability to activate large numbers of lymphocytes, are likely to contribute to these disorders in a number of ways.  the demonstrated activities of bacterial superantigens include increasing the number of circulating lymphocytes, with activation of autoreactive subsets, upregulation of tissue homing receptors on circulating lymphocytes, and local activation of immune cells within affected tissues. through these and other mechanisms, superantigens have a proven ability to induce high levels of inflammatory cytokines and/or initiate autoimmune responses that contribute to the development of skin and vascular disorders. though development of the illnesses discussed in this review are highly complex processes, superantigens may well play a critical role in their onset or maintenance. understanding superantigen function may elucidate potential therapeutic strategies for these disorders.

TI  == expression and purification of histidine-tagged proteins from the gram-positive streptococcus gordonii spex system.
AB  == streptococcus gordonii (s. gordonii) has been used as a gram-positive bacterial expression vector for secreted or surface-anchored recombinant proteins. fusion of the gram-positive bacterial n-terminal signal sequence to the target protein is all that is required for efficient export. this system is termed spex for surface protein expression and has been used to express proteins for a variety of uses. in this study, the spex system has been further developed by the construction of vectors that express polyhistidine-tagged fusion proteins. spex vectors were constructed with an n-terminal or c-terminal histidine tag. the c-repeat region (crr) from streptococcus pyogenes m6 protein and the staphylococcus aureus nuclease a (nuca) enzyme were tested for expression. the fusion proteins were purified using metal affinity chromatography (mac). results  show that the fusion proteins were expressed and secreted from s. gordonii with the his tag at either the n- or c-terminal position and could be purified using mac. the m6 fusions retained immunoreactivity after expression and purification as determined by immunoblots and elisa analyses. in addition, nuca fusions retained functional activity after mac purification. the m6-his and nuca-his fusions were purified approximately 15- and 10-fold respectively with approximately 30% recovery of protein using mac. this study shows that the polyhistidine tag in either the n- or c-terminal position is a viable way to purify secreted heterologous proteins from the supernatant of recombinant s. gordonii cultures. this study further illustrates the value of the spex system for secreted expression and purification of proteins.

TI  == spinal instrumentation for primary pyogenic infection report of 31 patients.
AB  == the role of spinal instrumentation in the presence of infection is still controversial. radical debridements of infected vertebrae and disc material and bone grafting usually leaves the spine unstable without some surgical stabilisation. we reviewed 31 cases of primary pyogenic spinal infection treated  by radical debridement, bone grafting and posterior (30) or anterior (1) spinal instrumentation. the indication for surgery was the failure of conservative treatment (8), progressive neurological deficit (19) or the lack of diagnosis (3). the clinical, laboratory and radiological parameters were assessed pre and postoperatively. the mean period of follow-up was 3.8 years (1-12 years). the neurological deficit was progressive in 19 patients, following surgery all these  patients were improved. the neurological deficit was established in one patient;  following surgery, his neurological deficit did not improve. the infection was eradicated in all our patients. the following complications were encountered: (1) three patients developed deep wound infection, which responded to repeated debridement; (2) one death resulted from nosocomial septicaemia, (3) reoperation  was carried out on one patient for implant failure and on another for a dislodged anterior bone graft. we conclude that spinal instrumentation may be indicated when after radical debridement of infected vertebrae and disc material and bone grafting the stability of the spine is still compromised. according to the location of the infection and the availability of suitable implants, anterior or  posterior instrumentation may be necessary. with appropriate antimicrobial agents, the outcome has been satisfactory in our patients.

AB  == background: over the past decade, resistance of gram-positive cocci to common antibiotics has steadily increased. new antibacterial agents that are active against multidrug-resistant pathogens are urgently needed for the treatment of these pathogens. we conducted an in vitro study on the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin and other antibiotics against common clinical isolates  of the gram-positive cocci, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis. methods: the agar dilution method described by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of bacterial isolates from clinical specimens obtained from patients in a medical center. results: all staphylococcus aureus isolates were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin (< or = 2 micrograms/ml). the mic90s were  1 mg/ml for both methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s aureus. quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibited streptococci at a concentration of 1 microgram/ml or less. the mic90s were 1 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, s pyogenes and viridans streptococci. ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecium was inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin at 0.5 to 4 micrograms/ml, with an mic90 of 1 microgram/ml. h influenzae was inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin at 0.25 to 8 micrograms/ml, with an mic90 of 4 micrograms/ml. b catarrhalis was inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin at 0.25 to 1 microgram/ml, with an mic90 of 1 microgram/ml. conclusions: we found that quinupristin/dalfopristin showed good in vitro activity against staphylococci, streptococci and b catarrhalis but less in vitro activity against h influenzae.

TI  == bacteriology of the tonsil core in recurrent tonsillitis and tonsillar hyperplasia--a short review.
AB  == in recurrent tonsillitis, the tonsil core harbours numerous bacteria, some of which are pathogenic and may occur in great numbers. the most frequent bacteria are haemophilus influenzae, followed by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. a high tissue concentration of these bacteria correlates with clinical  parameters of infection and hyperplasia of the tonsils. the role of streptococcus pyogenes, while undisputed in acute and epidemic tonsillitis, should perhaps be re-evaluated in recurrent and/or hyperplastic tonsillitis.

TI  == [multilocus sequencing--a new method of genotyping bacteria and first results of  its use].
AB  == comparative characterization (molecular typing) of isolates within a bacterial species is one of the major problems in microbiology and epidemiology. however, it is rather difficult to correlate data obtained in various laboratories, because traditional, including molecular, methods employed in typing pathogenic microorganisms cannot be standardized. in 1998, maiden et al. proposed multilocus sequence typing (mlst); through which alleles of several housekeeping genes are directly assessed by nucleotide sequencing, each unique allele combination determining a sequence type of a strain. the advantages of this approach are that the culturing of pathogenic microorganisms is avoided, as their gene fragments are amplified directly from biological samples, and that the sequencing data are  unambiguous, easy to standardize, and electronically portable. the latter makes it possible to generate an expandable global database for each species at an internet site, in order to use it for the purposes of genotyping pathogenic bacteria (and other infectious agents). mlst protocols have been elaborated for neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and helicobacter pylori; those  for streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and haemophilus influenzae are now being developed. basic principles and the first results of mlst have been reviewed, including data on the distribution and microevolution of n. meningitidis clones causing epidemic meningococcal infection, the relative recombination and mutation rates in the n. meningitidis genome, the identification of antibiotic-resistant s. pneumoniae clones causing severe generalized infection, the grouping of h. pylori isolates from various geographic regions, etc.

TI  == conservation and variation in superantigen structure and activity highlighted by  the three-dimensional structures of two new superantigens from streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == bacterial superantigens (sags) are a structurally related group of protein toxins secreted by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. they are implicated in a range of human pathologies associated with bacterial infection whose symptoms result from sag-mediated stimulation of a large number (2-20%) of t-cells. at the molecular level, bacterial sags bind to major histocompatability  class ii (mhc-ii) molecules and disrupt the normal interaction between mhc-ii and t-cell receptors (tcrs). we have determined high-resolution crystal structures of two newly identified streptococcal superantigens, spe-h and smez-2. both structures conform to the generic bacterial superantigen folding pattern, comprising an ob-fold n-terminal domain and a beta-grasp c-terminal domain. spe-h and smez-2 also display very similar zinc-binding sites on the outer concave surfaces of their c-terminal domains. structural comparisons with other sags identify two structural sub-families. sub-families are related by conserved core  residues and demarcated by variable binding surfaces for mhc-ii and tcr. smez-2 is most closely related to the streptococcal sag spe-c, and together they constitute one structural sub-family. in contrast, spe-h appears to be a hybrid whose n-terminal domain is most closely related to the seb sub-family and whose c-terminal domain is most closely related to the spe-c/smez-2 sub-family. mhc-ii  binding for both spe-h and smez-2 is mediated by the zinc ion at their c-terminal face, whereas the generic n-terminal domain mhc-ii binding site found on many sags appears not to be present. structural comparisons provide evidence for variations in tcr binding between spe-h, smez-2 and other members of the sag family; the extreme potency of smez-2 (active at 10(-15) g ml-1 levels) is likely to be related to its tcr binding properties. the smez gene shows allelic variation that maps onto a considerable proportion of the protein surface. this allelic variation, coupled with the varied binding modes of sags to mhc-ii and tcr, highlights the pressure on sags to avoid host immune defences.

TI  == toxic shock syndrome.
AB  == toxic shock syndrome (tss) is an acute febrile illness accompanied by watery diarrhea, sunburn rash, vomiting, hypotension, and multiple organ involvement. when it was initially recognized 20 years ago, tss was primarily associated with  menstruation. since then, the frequency of menstrual tss has decreased dramatically. staphylococcus aureus is the cause of menstrual tss and is also responsible for about half of all cases of nonmenstrual tss. since the late 1980s, streptococcus pyogenes has been shown to cause a nonmenstrual tss-like illness, with a higher mortality rate. the mechanism of tss is attributable to bacterial endotoxins that impede the body's immune system and cause the release of cytokines, which are responsible for the clinical manifestations of the disease. early recognition and treatment of tss are important factors in improving patient survival. patients should be treated with parenteral antibiotics that are highly effective against staphylococci and streptococci. they should also receive fluid resuscitation and vasopressors. some patients require intubation, dialysis, or immunoglobulin therapy.

TI  == comparative efficacy of gemifloxacin in experimental models of pyelonephritis and wound infection.
AB  == gemifloxacin (sb-265805) is a potent, novel fluoroquinolone with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. in this study, the efficacy of gemifloxacin was studied in experimental models of gram-negative pyelonephritis (caused by escherichia coli or proteus mirabilis) and gram-positive wound infection resulting from streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis or staphylococcus aureus. gemifloxacin activity against these pathogens was compared with those of amoxycillin-clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime, azithromycin, trovafloxacin,  grepafloxacin, levofloxacin and tosufloxacin. oral treatment was initiated 1 h after infection and continued once or twice daily for 3 days. around 17 h after the end of treatment, animals were killed and the infected kidneys or the skin around the wound site were excised for the enumeration of viable bacteria. in the pyelonephritis model (either microorganism), gemifloxacin reduced bacterial numbers significantly (p < 0.01) compared with no treatment. no comparator agent  had a greater effect than gemifloxacin. notably, grepafloxacin and azithromycin were significantly less effective (p < 0.01) than gemifloxacin against e. coli pyelonephritis, and amoxycillin-clavulanate, azithromycin and trovafloxacin were  inferior (p < 0.01) against p. mirabilis infection. in the s. pyogenes wound infection model, gemifloxacin, amoxycillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime and azithromycin reduced bacterial numbers significantly compared with controls (p <  0.01). results for the comparator quinolones were not significantly different from untreated controls (p > 0.05). gemifloxacin was also effective against staphylococcal infection, as were grepafloxacin and levofloxacin, while ciprofloxacin, trovafloxacin and tosufloxacin were significantly less effective against these pathogens than gemifloxacin (p < 0.01). no comparator agent had greater activity than gemifloxacin against s. pyogenes or s. aureus infections. these data demonstrate the potential benefit of gemifloxacin in the treatment of  gram-negative urinary tract infection and gram-positive skin and soft tissue infection.

AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

TI  == beta 2 integrins are involved in cytokine responses to whole gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == proinflammatory cytokines have an important pathophysiologic role in septic shock. cd14 is involved in cytokine responses to a number of purified bacterial products, including lps. however, little is known of monocyte receptors involved  in cytokine responses to whole bacteria. to identify these receptors, human monocytes were pretreated with different mabs and tnf-alpha was measured in culture supernatants after stimulation with whole heat-killed bacteria. human serum and anti-cd14 abs significantly increased and decreased, respectively, tnf-alpha responses to the gram-negative escherichia coli. however, neither treatment influenced responses to any of the gram-positive bacteria tested, including group a and b streptococci, listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus  aureus. complement receptor type iii (cr3 or cd18/cd11b) abs prevented tnf-alpha  release induced by heat-killed group a or b streptococci. in contrast, the same abs had no effects when monocytes were stimulated with l. monocytogenes or s. aureus. using either of the latter bacteria, significant inhibition of tnf-alpha  release was produced by abs to cd11c, one of the subunits of cr4. to confirm these blocking ab data, il-6 release was measured in cr3-, cr4-, or cd14-transfected chinese hamster ovary cells after bacterial stimulation. accordingly, streptococci triggered moderate il-6 production (p < 0.05) in cr3 but not cd14 or cr4 transfectants. in contrast, l. monocytogenes and s. aureus induced il-6 release in cr4 but not cr3 or cd14 transfectants. collectively our data indicate that beta 2 integrins, such as cr3 and cr4, may be involved in cytokine responses to gram-positive bacteria. moreover, cd14 may play a more important role in responses to whole gram-negative bacteria relative to gram-positive ones.

AB  == staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes express pyrogenic toxin superantigens (ptsags) that are associated with toxic shock syndrome (tss) and staphylococcal food poisoning (sfp). most ptsags cause tss in deep-tissue infections, whereas only tss toxin 1 (tsst-1) is associated with menstrual, vaginal tss. in contrast, sfp has been linked only with staphylococcal enterotoxins (ses). because of the differential abilities of ptsags to cause systemic or localized symptoms in a site-dependent manner, the present study was  undertaken to assess the toxins' abilities to cross mucosal barriers. the activity of three ptsags when delivered orally, vaginally, or intravenously to rabbits and orally to monkeys was investigated. tsst-1 induced shock via all three routes in rabbits. although active when administered intravenously, sec1 and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin a (spea) did not cause symptoms when administered orally or vaginally. only sec1 induced emesis in the monkey feeding  assay. tsst-1, albeit less stable than sec1 and spea to pepsin, induced diarrhea  in monkeys. our results may explain the unique association of tsst-1 with menstrual tss and why spea is only rarely associated with tss after pharyngitis,  despite being highly associated with tss after subcutaneous infections. finally,  our studies indicate that enterotoxicity in sfp is not the result of superantigenicity.

TI  == molecular characterization of the ferric-uptake regulator, fur, from staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == iron is an essential nutrient for the survival and pathogenesis of bacteria, but  relatively little is known regarding its transport and regulation in staphylococci. based on the known sequences of ferric-uptake regulatory (fur) genes from several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, a fragment containing the fur homologue was cloned from a genomic library of staphylococcus  aureus rn450. nucleotide sequence analysis of this fragment revealed the presence of a 447 bp orf that encodes a putative 149 aa polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 17 kda. a putative ferrichrome-uptake (fhu) operon, containing  the conserved fur-binding sequences (fur box) in the promoter region, was also cloned from the same s. aureus library. to characterize the impact of fur on the  fhu operon, fur was cloned, overexpressed as a his-tagged protein and purified by ni2+-affinity column chromatography. the recombinant protein was digested with enterokinase to remove the his tag. electrophoretic mobility-shift assays indicated that fur binds to the promoter region of the fhu operon in the presence of divalent cations. fur also interacted with the promoter region of the recently reported sir operon that has been proposed to constitute a siderophore-transport  system in s. aureus. the dnase i-protection assay revealed that fur specifically  binds to the fur box located in the promoter region of the fhu operon. the primer-extension reaction indicated that the transcription-start site of the fhu  operon was located inside the fur box. s. aureus fur partially complemented a fur- mutation in bacillus subtilis. the data suggest that fur regulates iron-transport processes in s. aureus.

TI  == superantigen antagonist protects against lethal shock and defines a new domain for t-cell activation.
AB  == superantigens trigger an excessive cellular immune response, leading to toxic shock. we have designed a peptide antagonist that inhibits superantigen-induced expression of human genes for interleukin-2, gamma interferon and tumor necrosis  factor-b, which are cytokines that mediate shock. the peptide shows homology to a b-strand-hinge-a-helix domain that is structurally conserved in superantigens, yet is remote from known binding sites for the major histocompatibility class ii  molecule and t-cell receptor. superantigens depend on this domain for t-cell activation. the peptide protected mice against lethal challenge with staphylococcal and streptococcal superantigens. moreover, it rescued mice undergoing toxic shock. surviving mice rapidly developed protective antibodies against superantigen that rendered them resistant to further lethal challenges, even with different superantigens. thus, the lethal effect of superantigens can be blocked with a peptide antagonist that inhibits their action at the beginning  of the toxicity cascade, before activation of t cells takes place.

AB  == microscopic methods (light and electron microscopy, histochemistry, immunohistochemistry) have been used to assess previously unknown pulmonary inflammatory responses of specific pathogen-free (spf) mice secondary to infection via the nares by group a, type 50, streptococci suspended in saline ("strep group mice"). as controls for the strep group mice, the animals were either injected with saline alone via nares (no lesions were seen), or with staphylococcus aureus in saline ("staph group mice") or with e. coli ("e. coli group mice"). the three different bacterial species caused clearly different histological changes in the lung. in the strep group mice, the microscopic findings were consistent with the diagnosis of lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia of bronchiolovascular bundles, secondary to exaggerated pulmonary recirculation of lymphocytes, concomitant with vasoconstrictive angiopathy of encased pulmonary artery branches and nodular inflammatory cell aggregates in lung parenchyma. these aggregates either consisted predominantly of lymphocytes, or of mixed cells (neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages) or of activated macrophages only. in 18 of 22 inflamed lungs of strep group mice, no bacteria could be cultured from lung tissue. in staph group mice the microscopic findings are consistent with the diagnosis of lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia of bronchiolovascular bundles, secondary to exaggerated pulmonary recirculation of lymphocytes only. in 12 of 17 inflamed lungs of staph group mice, no bacteria could be cultured from lung tissue. in e. coli group mice the microscopic findings were consistent with the diagnosis of distal terminal bronchiolitis and early pleural-based pneumonitis, in which lymphocytes and neutrophils mingled with macrophages. in 10 of 11 inflamed lungs of e. coli group mice, no bacteria could be cultured from lung tissue. the morphologic approaches described here may have potential for unravelling the complex inflammatory processes underlying different forms of interstitial and parenchymal pneumonia.

TI  == group b streptococci and other gram-positive cocci bind to cytokeratin 8.
AB  == group b streptococci (gbs) adhere to surface receptors present on epithelial cells; these receptors include fibronectin and laminin. to identify other possible receptors, plasma membranes from a549 cells, a respiratory tract epithelial cell line, were prepared. these plasma membranes were tested in a protein blot analysis using radiolabeled gbs as a probe. gbs adhered to two species, with molecular masses of 50 kda (p50) and 57 kda (p57). we concluded that p50 and p57 correspond to two forms of cytokeratin 8 (ck8) on the basis of the following results: (i) protein blot results demonstrated that p50 and p57 exactly comigrated with two forms of ck8 after separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page); (ii) p50 and p57 exactly comigrated with ck8 after separation by two-dimensional page; (iii) ck8 in solution bound to gbs, as demonstrated by immunoblot analysis of proteins from a549 lysates that bound to gbs in a liquid-phase assay; and (iv) radiolabeled gbs bound to a549 lysate-derived ck8 that had been captured in anti-ck8-coated microtiter wells. ck8 bound to coh1-13, an acapsular mutant of coh1, demonstrating that adherence is not mediated by capsular polysaccharide. trypsin-treated gbs did not bind to ck8, indicating that adherence is mediated via a protein on the surface of gbs. soluble ck8 bound to six of six gbs strains  tested. soluble ck8 also bound to staphylococcus aureus, lactococcus lactis, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pyogenes. we hypothesize that adherence  of gbs to cytokeratin may be important for maintenance of colonization at sites of keratinized epithelium, such as the vagina, or for adherence of these bacteria to damaged epithelial cells at other sites.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin against 4151 gram-negative and gram-positive organisms.
AB  == gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin are fluoroquinolones  with enhanced gram-positive activity while retaining broad-spectrum activity against gram-negative pathogens. levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin are older quinolones with broad activity against gram-negative pathogens and borderline activity against some gram-positive organisms. we compared the in vitro activity  of these compounds against 4151 gram-negative and -positive organisms. gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin were highly active against penicillin sensitive and resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae. ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were active but less potent. all compounds were highly active (overall) against gram-negative pathogens with ciprofloxacin being  the most active agent against pseudomonas aeruginosa. our data indicate that the  advanced fluoroquinolones will be important compounds for treating infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == the in vitro effects of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate on oral and pharyngeal microorganisms of various ecological niches.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the in vitro susceptibility to cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for various aerobic and anaerobic micro-organisms responsible for oral and pharyngeal diseases by assessing the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations  (mbcs) or minimum fungicidal concentrations (mfcs) and by determining kill-times. the mics of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for 46 tested strains (25 reference strains and 21 clinical isolates) ranged from 8 to 500 micrograms/ml. the mic was found to be 31.25 micrograms/ml for 36% of the reference strains. even lower mic values (15.63 micrograms/ml) were observed for some anaerobic strains, for haemophilus influenzae and for candida tropicalis. mic and mbc values corresponded for the majority of strains tested while the mfc for c. tropicalis and c. albicans was much higher. only 9.5% of the clinical isolates gave a mic value of 31.25 micrograms/ml. enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus showed mic at 62.5 micrograms/ml. the mic and  mbc values among the isolates were comparable, while the mfc value for the yeasts was greater. a concentration of 125 micrograms/ml of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate inhibited the growth of all bacteria, except enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonaceae, and yeasts. cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate shows very rapid kill-time for s. sanguis (0"), and rapid (15") for s. pyogenes, s. dysgalactiae and s. mutans and for moraxella catarrhalis, while a longer kill-time was necessary for the other microbes tested.

TI  == cell adhesion molecules in the pathogenesis of and host defence against microbial infection.
AB  == eukaryotic cell adhesion molecules (cams) are used by various cells and extracellular molecules in host defence against infection. they are involved in many processes including recognition by circulating phagocytes of a site of inflammation, transmigration through the endothelial barrier, diapedesis through  basement membrane and extracellular matrix, and release of effector mechanisms at the infected site. cams involved in leucocyte-endothelial cell interaction include the selectins, integrins, and members of the immunoglobulin superfamily.  however, cams are also used by various microorganisms (protozoa, fungi, bacteria, and viruses) during their pathogenesis. for example, bacteria that utilise cams include mycobacterium tuberculosis, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia spp, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, shigella spp, neisseria spp, bordetella spp, and borrelia burgdorferi. in addition, cams are involved in the pathogenetic effects of the rtx toxins of pasteurella haemolytica, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and the superantigen exotoxins of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. a recurrent and topical theme of potential importance within the bacterial group is the intimate relation between cams, bacterial protein receptors, and type iii secretion systems. for example, the ipabcd protein complex is secreted by the type iii system of shigella flexneri and interacts with alpha 5 beta 1 integrin on the eukaryotic cell surface, followed by rho mediated internalisation; this illustrates the relevance of cellular microbiology. cams might prove to be novel therapeutic targets. comparative genomics has provided the knowledge of shared virulence determinants among diverse bacterial genera, and will continue to deepen our understanding of microbial pathogenesis, particularly in the context of the interaction of prokaryotic and eukaryotic molecules.

TI  == effects of the hinge region of cecropin a(1-8)-magainin 2(1-12), a synthetic antimicrobial peptide, on liposomes, bacterial and tumor cells.
AB  == a 20-residue hybrid peptide (ca(1-8)-ma(1-12): kwklfkkigigkflhsakkf-nh(2)) incorporating 1-8 residues of cecropin a (ca) and 1-12 residues of magainin 2 (ma) has potent antibiotic activity without hemolytic activity. in order to investigate the effects of the flexible hinge sequence, gly-ile-gly of ca(1-8)-ma(1-12) (ca-ma) on antibiotic activity, ca-ma and its three analogues, ca-ma1, ca-ma2 and ca-ma3 were synthesized. the gly-ile-gly sequence of ca-ma was deleted in ca-ma1 and replaced with pro and gly-pro-gly in ca-ma2 and ca-ma3, respectively. ca-ma1 and ca-ma3 caused a significant decrease in the bactericidal rate against escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis and the tumoricidal activity  against four different tumor cells, and the pc/ps (4:1, w/w) vesicle-aggregating  and disrupting activities. however, ca-ma2 showed a similar bactericidal rate and antitumor, vesicle-aggregating and disrupting activities, as compared with ca-ma. these results suggested that the flexibility or beta-turn induced by gly-ile-gly  or pro in the central part of ca-ma may be important in the electrostatic interaction of the cationic short alpha-helical region in the n-terminus with the cell membrane surface and the hydrophobic interaction of amphipathic alpha-helical region in the c-terminus with the hydrophobic acyl chains in the cell membrane. ca-ma3 exhibited lower activity in antibacterial, antitumor, and vesicle-aggregating and disrupting activities than ca-ma and ca-ma2. this result  suggested that the excessive beta-turn structure by gly-pro-gly in ca-ma3 seems to interrupt the ion channel/pore formation on the lipid bilayer. it was concluded that the appropriate flexibility or beta-turn structure provided by the central hinge is responsible for the effective antibiotic activity of the antimicrobial peptides with the helix-hinge-helix structure.

TI  == efficacy of a new cream formulation of mupirocin: comparison with oral and topical agents in experimental skin infections.
AB  == a new cream formulation of mupirocin developed to improve patient compliance was  compared with systemic and topical antibiotics commonly used to treat primary and secondary skin infections. a mouse surgical wound model infected with staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes was used. topical treatment was applied at 4 and 10 h postinfection or oral treatment at a clinically relevant dose was administered 4, 8, and 12 h postinfection; treatments were continued three times daily for a further 3 days. mupirocin cream was significantly more effective than (p < 0.01; two of eight studies) or not significantly different from (six of eight studies) mupirocin ointment in reducing bacterial numbers. mupirocin cream was similar in efficacy to oral flucloxacillin but significantly  more effective (p < 0.001) than oral erythromycin. it was also similar in efficacy to cephalexin against s. pyogenes but superior against s. aureus (p < 0.01). mupirocin cream had a similar efficacy to fusidic acid cream against s. aureus but was significantly superior against s. pyogenes (p < 0.01). a hamster impetigo model infected with s. aureus was also used. topical or oral treatment was administered at 24 and 30 h postinfection (also 36 h postinfection for oral therapy) and then three times daily for a further 2 days. on day 5, mupirocin cream was significantly more effective than mupirocin ointment in one study (p <  0.01) and of similar efficacy in the other two studies. mupirocin cream was not significantly different from fusidic acid cream or neomycin-bacitracin cream, but it was significantly superior (p < 0.01) to oral erythromycin and cephalexin. mupirocin cream was as effective as, or superior to, oral and other topical agents commonly used for skin infections.

TI  == lipoteichoic acid inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced adhesion molecule expression and il-8 release in human lung microvascular endothelial cells.
AB  == cell adhesion molecule expression (cam) and il-8 release in lung microvascular endothelium facilitate neutrophil accumulation in the lung. this study investigated the effects of lipoteichoic acid (lta), a cell wall component of gram-positive bacteria, alone and with lps or tnf-alpha, on cam expression and il-8 release in human lung microvascular endothelial cells (hlmvec). the concentration-dependent effects of staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) lta (0.3-30  microg/ml) on icam-1 and e-selectin expression and il-8 release were bell shaped. streptococcus pyogenes (s. pyogenes) lta had no effect on cam expression, but caused a concentration-dependent increase in il-8 release. s. aureus and s. pyogenes lta (30 microg/ml) abolished lps-induced cam expression, and s. aureus lta reduced lps-induced il-8 release. in contrast, the effects of s. aureus lta with tnf-alpha on cam expression and il-8 release were additive. inhibitory effects of lta were not due to decreased hlmvec viability, as assessed by ethidium homodimer-1 uptake. changes in neutrophil adhesion to hlmvec paralleled  changes in cam expression. using rt-pcr to assess mrna levels, s. aureus lta (3 microg/ml) caused a protein synthesis-dependent reduction (75%) in lps-induced il-8 mrna and decreased the il-8 mrna half-life from >6 h with lps to approximately 2 h. these results suggest that mechanisms exist to prevent excessive endothelial cell activation in the presence of high concentrations of bacterial products. however, inhibition of hlmvec cam expression and il-8 release ultimately may contribute to decreased neutrophil accumulation, persistence of bacteria in the lung, and increased severity of infection.

AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid) is a new injectable streptogramin antibiotic proposed for the treatment of severe antimicrobial infections, that has been shown to be active against gram-positive, multi-resistant cocci. we compared the  in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin with that of amoxycillin, ampicillin, penicillin, cefixime, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, erythromycin, imipenem, meropenem, oxacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, teicoplanin and vancomycin. the susceptibility of 37 staphylococcus aureus (14 ms, 23 mr), 26 staphylococcus epidermidis (16 ms, 10 mr), 20 streptococcus pneumoniae, 33 group  a streptococcus pyogenes, 15 streptococcus agalactiae, 10 enterococcus faecalis (1 vancomycin-resistant), 15 enterococcus faecium (9 van a) was evaluated. quinupristin/dalfopristin was active against all gram-positive species tested, including met-r s. aureus (mic < or = 2 mg/l), met-r s. epidermidis (mic < or = 2 mg/l), s. pneumoniae (mic < or = 1 mg/l), ery-r and ery-s streptococci (mic < or  = 1 mg/l). the strains of e. faecalis were generally less susceptible. time-kill  studies confirmed that quinupristin/dalfopristin at 4 x mic concentration showed  a complete bactericidal effect (3 log reduction) in about 4 6 h against all strains tested. a post-antibiotic effect (pae) of 3.9-5.2 h was observed at 4 x mic concentration of quinupristin/dalfopristin against staphylococci. a prolonged pae was obtained for s. pneumoniae (8 h), s. pyogenes (9 h) and s. agalactiae (7  h), while the shortest pae was seen for e. faecalis and e. faecium (about 4 h).

TI  == recent progress in novel macrolides, quinolones, and 2-pyridones to overcome bacterial resistance.
AB  == macrolides, such as clarithromycin and azithromycin, having good activity against pathogens such as legionella, chlamydia, campylobacter spp, branhamella spp, pasteurella multocida and streptococci, have gained wide acceptance for the treatment of both upper and lower respiratory tracts, as well as cutaneous infections. emergence of bacterial resistance, particularly in gram-positive bacteria, has been observed. macrolide-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and s.  pyogenes are found in france and many other countries, resulting in failure of therapy for pneumonia, pharyngitis, and skin infection. ru 004, hmr 3647, and te  802 were reported to be active against these resistant strains. research at abbott produced several macrolide derivatives in the anhydrolide, tricyclic and tetracyclic ketolides as well as 6-o-alkyl ketolides series having potent activity against macrolide resistant s. pyogenes and s. pneumoniae. research on streptogramins to overcome bacterial resistance in gram-positive bacteria has produced interesting compounds. another class of antibacterial agent called quinolones is useful for the treatment of bacterial infections of respiratory tract, urinary tract, skin and soft tissues, as well as sexually transmitted diseases. ciprofloxacin, the market leader, however, has low potency against anaerobes. bacterial resistance ( such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin- resistant staphylococcus aureus ) to ciprofloxacin is increasing rapidly. many quinolone compounds are being synthesized to address these drawbacks. the new quinolones currently under development are characterized by enhanced activities against streptococci, staphylococci, enterococci, and anaerobes. this presentation reviews the current research in the identification of agents to overcome the macrolide and quinolone resistance.

TI  == etiology of serious infections in young gambian infants.
AB  == background: despite improvements in infant mortality rates in many developing countries including the gambia, neonatal mortality remains high and many neonatal deaths are caused by infection. the study described in this paper was conducted to determine the bacterial and viral etiology of serious infections in gambian infants younger than 91 days old. methods: at a first level health facility 497 infants with symptoms that could indicate serious infection were enrolled, of whom 239 with 1 or more signs of serious infection and 55 with no signs were investigated, yielding 17 cases with positive bacterial cultures of blood and/or  cerebrospinal fluid. at a nearby pediatric referral hospital 198 infants were seen and 182 were investigated, yielding 35 positive bacterial cultures. results: there were 15 culture positive cases of meningitis caused by streptococcus pneumoniae (7), streptococcus pyogenes (2), enterobacter cloacae (2), escherichia coli (1), haemophilus influenzae type b (1), streptococcus agalactiae (1) and salmonella spp. (1). six of these children died. thirty-three infants without meningitis had positive blood cultures for staphylococcus aureus (17), s. pneumoniae (3), salmonella spp. (5), e. coli (3), other enterobacteria (4) and s. agalactiae (1), of whom 14 died. nasopharyngeal aspirates from 438 children were  investigated for common respiratory viruses. respiratory syncytial virus was found in 51, influenza a in 46, influenza b in 22, parainfluenza in 26 and adenovirus in 16. respiratory syncytial virus and influenza a isolates were found most frequently toward the end of the wet season. nasopharyngeal carriage of s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae was studied in 320 infants recruited during the first year. of these 184 (58%) were positive for s. pneumoniae and 141 (44%) were positive for h. influenzae, 18 of which were type b. infants with a bacterial isolate from blood or cerebrospinal fluid were more likely than the rest to die,  whereas those with a viral isolate were less likely to die. conclusions: the most important causes of serious infections in young gambian infants are staphylococcus aureus, s. pneumoniae and salmonella spp.

TI  == fusidic acid in skin and soft tissue infections.
AB  == skin and soft skin tissue infections are usually caused by staphylococcus aureus  and streptococcus pyogenes. in vitro data show good activity of fusidic acid against staphylococci but the minimal inhibitory concentrations for streptococci  are relatively high indicating marginal activity. a limited number of clinical trials have been performed using oral fusidic acid and although all have methodological problems the difference in susceptibility of these two organisms is apparent. the end of study cure rates for these studies were 91-99% for s. aureus and 75-85% for s. pyogenes. topical therapy has been used in a number of forms and for different skin infections. comparative studies have been conducted  with mupirocin, trimethoprim/polymixin cream, hydrogen peroxide and combination steroid preparations. for most of these studies fusidic acid was equivalent to the comparator agent except where there was a proven s. pyogenes infection. studies with topical fusidic acid have also been reported in specific disease states such as acne, erythrasma, and abscesses with good results.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro activity of fk041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with  those of cefdinir (cfdn) and cefditoren (cdtr). fk041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk041 was active against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms  except enterococcus faecalis with mic90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. fk041 was more active than cfdn and cdtr against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to cfdn and cdtr against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. fk041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae with an mic range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to cfdn but inferior to cdtr. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative organisms such as neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, fk041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of cfdn and cdtr. however, it was inferior to cdtr in activity against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, morganella morganii, and serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. with fk041 a small difference between mic and mbc against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. fk041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. the stability of fk041 to these enzymes was similar to those of cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of s. aureus (pbp 3, 2, and 1) and e. coli (pbp 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).

TI  == optimal treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections.
AB  == gram-positive bacteria (e.g. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes) are the main cause of skin and skin structure infections (sssi). treatment presents a clinical challenge to the physician, particularly with the increase in multidrug-resistant strains and widespread cross-resistance to antibiotic treatment. initial treatment of sssi involves the use of fluoroquinolones or penicillinase-resistant penicillins. if infection is caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci, therapy with glycopeptides is warranted. however, in the last few years several cases of infection caused by strains of s. aureus with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides have been reported. quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new streptogramin that has shown efficacy in the management of multidrug-resistant gram-positive infections. two major studies suggest that in the treatment of complicated sssi, the clinical efficacy of quinupristin/dalfopristin is equivalent to that of vancomycin and/or oxacillin and vancomycin and/or cefazolin.

TI  == correlation between consumption of antimicrobials in humans and development of resistance in bacteria.
AB  == the correlation between consumption of antimicrobials in humans and the emergence of resistance in bacteria is complex and has proved difficult to establish. besides antimicrobial use, many other distinct contributing factors are also involved in the issue. despite this complexity, there is a substantial body of evidence that the use of antibiotics in prophylaxis and in therapy is associated  with the development of resistance in the hospital and in the community. some examples are reviewed, including increase of resistance in enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci and streptococcus pyogenes after the use of beta-lactam antibiotics, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones and macrolides. success in reversing the rise of resistant strains has been rarely described. two examples are highlighted, the reduction in the incidence of nasal carriage of penicillin-resistant pneumococci in icelandic  children, and a significant decline in erythromycin resistance in s. pyogenes after the reduction in the use of macrolides in finland.

TI  == identification, cloning, and expression of the camp factor gene (cfa) of group a  streptococci.
AB  == the camp reaction is a synergistic lysis of erythrocytes by the interaction of an extracellular protein (camp factor) produced by some streptococcal species with the staphylococcus aureus sphingomyelinase c (beta-toxin). group a streptococci (gas [streptococcus pyogenes]) have been long considered camp negative, and this  reaction commonly has been used to distinguish gas from streptococcus agalactiae. we here provide evidence that gas possess this gene and produce an extracellular  camp factor capable of participating in a positive camp reaction. the s. pyogenes camp factor is specified by a 774-bp open reading frame homologous to the camp factor genes from s. agalactiae and streptococcus uberis. this gene, designated cfa, was isolated on a 1,256-bp fragment and cloned in escherichia coli. recombinant clones of e. coli expressing cfa secreted an active camp factor. the  deduced 28.5-kda protein encoded by cfa consists of 257 amino acids, with a predicted 28-amino-acid signal peptide. the cfa gene is widely spread among gas:  82 of 100 clinical gas isolates produced a positive camp reaction. of the camp-negative strains, 17 of the 18 gas strains contained the cfa gene. additionally, camp activity was detected in streptococci from serogroups c, m, p, r, and u. the cfa gene was cloned and actively expressed in escherichia coli and  gene fusions were made, placing the beta-galactosidase gene (lacz) under control  of the cfa promoter. these cfa promoter-lacz fusions were introduced into s. pyogenes via a bacteriophage-derived site-specific integration vector where they  showed that the cfa gene has a strong promoter that may be subject to as-yet-unidentified regulatory factors. the results presented here, along with previous reports, indicate that the camp factor gene is fairly widespread among streptococci, being present at least in groups a, b, c, g, m, p, r, and u.

TI  == cytokine and chemokine induction using cell wall component and toxin derived from gram-positive bacteria in the rat middle ear.
AB  == lipoteichoic acid (lta) is one of the components present within the cell wall layer of most gram-positive bacteria. it plays an important role in the initiation and progression of bacterial infection. in this study, we performed a  rat middle ear and nasal perfusion with lta purified from two different gram-positive bacterial species. using elisa and rt-pcr, the production and mrna  expression of rat chemokine, gro/cinc-1, proinflammatory cytokine, tnf-alpha, in  rat middle ear lavage and mucosa were investigated. gro/cinc-1 in middle ear lavage was produced by stimulation of lta in a time-dependent fashion; however, tnf-alpha production into the lavage was not detectable using elisa assay. the mrna expressions of gro/cinc-1 and tnf-alpha in the middle ear mucosa were both induced after lta and exotoxin exposures. the expression of il-10 mrna was also induced after 6 h of lta and exotoxin exposures. the profile of the production of gro/cinc-1 and tnf-alpha in rat nasal lavage was similar to that in the middle ear; however, the mrna expressions of gro/cinc-1, tnf-alpha and il-10 in the nasal mucosa were different from those in the middle ear mucosa. these results suggest that the cell wall component and exotoxin of gram-positive bacteria can induce several cytokines in vivo and play an important role in the initiation of  the inflammatory cascade in the middle ear.

AB  == animal test systems are reviewed that have relevance to sudden infant death syndrome (sids) are reviewed. these test interactions between infectious agents (or their toxins) and products of cigarette smoke. infectious agents implicated in sids include members of the enterobacteria and clostridia, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. smoking is thought to be the single most preventable cause of sids. tobacco smoke contains many extremely toxic products including cyanide and nicotine. many animal test systems are available to examine the potency of bacterial toxins and smoke-derived components. these include mice, hamsters, rats and chick embryos. such systems reveal synergy between bacterial toxins, especially endotoxin and superantigens. they have also demonstrated potentiation of low levels of bacterial toxin by low levels of both nicotine and  its primary metabolite, cotinine. these findings suggest a possible causal explanation for the fact that passive exposure to cigarette smoke is a risk factor in sudden infant death syndrome.

AB  == we undertook to identify the antimicrobial susceptibility of the pathogens isolated from patients with otitis media or maxillary sinusitis who failed to respond to antimicrobial therapy, and correlate it with previous antimicrobial therapy and smoking. we analyzed isolates recovered from 2 consecutive cultures obtained from middle ear aspirate obtained through an open perforation in 22 children with otitis, and maxillary sinus aspirate collected by endoscopy from 20 patients. forty-seven isolates were repeatedly recovered from 42 culture-positive individuals. the organisms isolated were streptococcus pneumoniae (15 isolates),  haemophilus influenzae (14), staphylococcus aureus (7), moraxella catarrhalis (6), and streptococcus pyogenes (5). resistance of at least 2 tube dilutions to the antimicrobial agents used was found in 23 of the 47 (49%) isolates that were  found in 20 (48%) of the patients. these included 10 of 15 (67%) isolates of s pneumoniae, 4 of 14 (29%) h influenzae (all were beta-lactamase producers), 4 of  7 (57%) s aureus (all beta-lactamase producers), 5 of 6 (83%) m catarrhalis (all  beta-lactamase producers), and none of 5 s pyogenes. in the 21 patients who failed to respond to amoxicillin, h influenzae and s pneumoniae predominated. streptococcus pneumoniae was recovered from 4 of the 11 (36%) after trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 4 of 21 (19%) after amoxicillin, 2 of 3 (67%) after azithromycin dihydrate, and 1 of 4 (25%) after cefixime. a statistically significant higher recovery of resistant organisms was noted in those treated 2 to 6 months previously, and in those with sinusitis who smoked. the data illustrate the relationship between resistance to antimicrobials and failure of patients with otitis media and sinusitis to improve.

AB  == in vitro cytokine production by tonsillar mononuclear cells under culture conditions with or without lyophilized streptococcal antigens was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). under culture conditions without any stimulus, a certain amount of interferon (ifn)-gamma, tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, and interleukin (il)-6, was detected in the supernatant culture fluids from all 29 donors tested and just detectable levels of il-1alpha and il-2 were identified in 5 of 12 donors tested; but il-4 and il-5 were not detected in  any supernatants from 21 donors tested. in 16 patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (ppp), all three alpha-streptococcal antigens from streptococcus, (s.) sanguis, s. salivarius and s. mitis induced production of il-6. ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha by tonsillar mononuclear cells at a significant level. however, no  significant induction of such cytokines by alpha-streptococcal stimulus was seen  in 13 donors without ppp. no significant difference in cytokine production by tonsillar mononuclear cells was seen between the ppp and non-ppp subjects, when stimulated with s. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus cowan i and pokeweed mitogen.  in the experiments using tonsillar cell subsets, the cytokine inductions by alpha-streptococcal stimulus were found in monocyte-depleted cells as well as in  purified t-cells. but not in b-cells. these data suggest that il-6, ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha may play an important role in immunological reactions in the tonsils and that a hyper-immune response to some of alpha-streptococcal antigens through  increased production of such cytokines by tonsillar mononuclear cells, to which t-cells mainly contribute, may play a key role in the pathogenesis of ppp.

AB  == to determine to what extent methodological differences affect susceptibility testing parameters for linezolid, mics and disk inhibition zones were compared using the methods described by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards and the british society for antimicrobial chemotherapy for 198 strains  of gram-positive cocci. zones were 4-5 mm larger by the british society for antimicrobial chemotherapy method, but mics did not differ, except for pneumococci, which were more sensitive when the british society for antimicrobial chemotherapy method was used. this is because incubation in co2 depresses the activity of linezolid against this species only. breakpoints for linezolid may need adjusting when testing is by other than national committee for clinical laboratory standards methods.

TI  == the effect of previous antibiotic therapy on the bacteriology of the tonsils in children.
AB  == the bacteriology of the tonsillar surface and core in 30 children undergoing tonsillectomy was studied. antibiotics taken in the six months before surgery were recorded. haemophilus influenzae and staphylococcus aureus were the commonest isolates; streptococcus pyogenes was relatively rare. eight children had received no antibiotics, the others had been prescribed 65 different courses  of 13 different types. no relationship between the various antibiotic regimens prescribed and tonsillar bacteriology could be demonstrated, and it would appear  that the tonsillar bacteriology at the time of tonsillectomy is not altered by antibiotics prescribed in the previous six months.

TI  == structure and function of streptococcal and staphylococcal superantigens in septic shock.
AB  == the pyrogenic exotoxins of group a streptococci and enterotoxins of staphylococcus aureus constitute a family of related toxins that acts as "superantigens" because of their ability to stimulate large numbers of t-cell subsets. these toxins have been implicated in gastrointestinal food poisoning, toxic shock syndromes, gram-positive sepsis, and, possibly, septic shock. there is increasing evidence that gram-positive infections frequently coexist in septic shock and that bacterial superantigens play a major role.

AB  == the results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the japanese ministry of health and welfare during the period of january 1993 to july 1995, were analyzed for typical gram-positive  cocci and gram-negative cocci in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. during these 3 years, streptococcus pyogenes (group a) and streptococcus agalactiae (group b) showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to ofloxacin (oflx) and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (st), while  streptococcus pneumoniae and moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis showed slightly  decreasing tendency to cefaclor (ccl). however, these annual changes were almost  negligible. generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against gram-positive and -negative cocci. however, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. on the other hand, cefmetazole (cmz), vancomycin (vcm), latamoxef (lmox), st and minocycline (mino) showed good activities against some of the gram-positive and -negative cocci to which no indication are approved. in conclusion, beside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents)  could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of an antimicrobial agent is necessary.

TI  == surface proteins of gram-positive bacteria and mechanisms of their targeting to the cell wall envelope.
AB  == the cell wall envelope of gram-positive bacteria is a macromolecular, exoskeletal organelle that is assembled and turned over at designated sites. the cell wall also functions as a surface organelle that allows gram-positive pathogens to interact with their environment, in particular the tissues of the infected host.  all of these functions require that surface proteins and enzymes be properly targeted to the cell wall envelope. two basic mechanisms, cell wall sorting and targeting, have been identified. cell well sorting is the covalent attachment of  surface proteins to the peptidoglycan via a c-terminal sorting signal that contains a consensus lpxtg sequence. more than 100 proteins that possess cell wall-sorting signals, including the m proteins of streptococcus pyogenes, protein a of staphylococcus aureus, and several internalins of listeria monocytogenes, have been identified. cell wall targeting involves the noncovalent attachment of  proteins to the cell surface via specialized binding domains. several of these wall-binding domains appear to interact with secondary wall polymers that are associated with the peptidoglycan, for example teichoic acids and polysaccharides. proteins that are targeted to the cell surface include muralytic enzymes such as autolysins, lysostaphin, and phage lytic enzymes. other examples  for targeted proteins are the surface s-layer proteins of bacilli and clostridia, as well as virulence factors required for the pathogenesis of l. monocytogenes (internalin b) and streptococcus pneumoniae (pspa) infections. in this review we  describe the mechanisms for both sorting and targeting of proteins to the envelope of gram-positive bacteria and review the functions of known surface proteins.

TI  == ctsr, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == clpp and clpc of bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the clp atp-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. they play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the  so-called class iii group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. the product of ctsr, the first gene of the clpc operon, has now been  shown to act as a repressor of both clpp and clpc, as well as clpe, which encodes a novel member of the hsp100 clp atpase family. the ctsr protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. random mutagenesis, dnasel footprinting and dna sequence deletions and comparisons were  used to define a consensus ctsr recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. this target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several gram-positive bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus salivarius, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, leuconostoc oenos, lactobacillus sake, lactococcus lactis and clostridium acetobutylicum. ctsr homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by ctsr is highly conserved in gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == secondarily infected wounds and dermatoses: a diagnosis and treatment guide.
AB  == secondary bacterial skin infections are common complications of primary dermatoses, primary nonbacterial skin infections, traumatic lesions, ulcers, cutaneous infestations, and other miscellaneous skin diseases. most diagnoses are based on information obtained by patient history and physical examination. secondary bacterial skin infections may be polymicrobial, commonly include the pathogens staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, and require proper antibiotic treatment. the use of topical antibiotics avoids the risk of systemic  allergic reactions or generalized side effects, and provides a high antibiotic concentration at the site of infection. therefore, topical antibiotics should be  considered as potential primary therapy in the emergency department. when systemic therapy is indicated, most commonly used agents for secondary skin infections are the penicillinase-resistant semi-synthetic penicillins; the first-generation cephalosporins, the macrolides; and combination antibacterials,  such as amoxicillin/ clavulanate potassium and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.

TI  == multiple specificities of the staphylococcal and streptococcal fibronectin-binding microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules.
AB  == many pathogenic gram-positive bacteria express fibronectin (fn)-binding microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (mscramms), most of which have a similar structural organization with a primary ligand-binding domain consisting of 3-6 repeats of 40-50 amino-acid-residue motifs. the mscramms appear to preferentially bind to the n-terminal region of fn, which is composed of five  type-i modules. here we report that the fn-binding mscramm fnbpa of staphylococcus aureus contains a second ligand-binding domain located outside the repeat units. in addition, several sites in the fn n-terminus presented as recombinant type-i module pairs bind to the repeat domain of the mscramm. all of  the mscramms analyzed, which include fnbpa of staphylococcus aureus, sfb of streptococcus pyogenes, and fnba and fnbb of streptococcus dysgalactiae, were shown to bind to multiple sites in the n-terminal domain of fn. by dissecting the repeat domain of fnbpa using synthetic peptides and recombinant fragments, we show that discrete, different motifs are responsible for the binding to individual sites in fn, rather than a common motif being able to bind to several  pairs of type-i fn modules. the c-terminal half of many of the mscramm repeat units contain a common motif, which is shown here to bind to the type-i module pair 4 and 5. in addition, some of the repeat units of fnbpa contain n-terminal motifs which bound to the type-i module pairs 1-2 and 2-3, respectively. these latter binding motifs appear to be partly overlapping and dependent on flanking sequences. fluorescence polarization experiments using fluorescein-labeled mscramm peptides and recombinant type-i fn module pairs revealed dissociation constants of 1-13 microm. it was also shown that the fluorescein-labeled peptides differed in their primary binding sites on fn.

AB  == exogenous antigens are presented to t lymphocytes through mechanisms that ensure  high recognition specificity. recently described superantigens in contrast to conventional antigens are particles that follow a different processing and presentation route not binding to a specific region of t lymphocyte receptors. these particles bind to a large number of t lymphocytes, generating a disproportionate and non-specific immune response. two types of superantigens have been described. endogenous superantigens, transported in the host genoma, have been involved in clonal depletion and immunological tolerance phenomena. exogenous superantigens, mainly bacterial toxins, have been involved in several diseases. there is evidence that these antigens participate in diseases such as kawasaki disease, toxic shock caused by staphylococcus aureus, rheumatoid arthritis, hiv infection and streptococcus pyogenes infections.

AB  == infective thyroiditis which was more common in the pre-antibiotic era is now rare in developed countries but continues to occur in less developed areas. over a 10-year period in zaria, nigeria which is situated in an endemic goitre region, nine such patients were treated. all were females, 30-50 years of age and had pre-existing, long-standing multinodular goitres. during the period, 84 patients  (including the nine patients) with endemic multinodular goitres were treated, giving an infective rate of 10.7% in these goitres. treatment was by adequate incision and drainage in all patients with suppuration. staphylococcus aureus was the commonest organism cultured and streptococcus pyogenes and pseudomonas were the infective agents in a minority. only one patient required thyroidectomy later, the goitre having disappeared in the other patients. one patient developed hypothyroidism requiring replacement therapy with thyroxine. thyroid abscess remains an ever present risk in endemic multinodular goitres in our environment.  early presentation after onset of pain, prompt administration of appropriate antibiotics and thyroidectomy soon after is likely to reduce the risk of abscess  formation in these goitres.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of infection after trauma.
AB  == clinical and laboratory data from 1973 to 1988 were retrospectively reviewed to study the microbiology of infection following trauma. a total of 368 specimens obtained from 340 trauma patients showed bacterial growth. the traumas included lacerations (163), blunt trauma (76), penetrating trauma (65), bites (20), and open fractures (10). anaerobic bacteria only were isolated in 119 (32%) specimens, aerobic bacteria only in 58 (16%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 191 (52%). a total of 444 anaerobic (1.2 isolates per specimen) and 267 aerobic or facultative (0.7 per specimen) were recovered. the predominant anaerobic bacteria included bacteroides fragilis group (119 isolates), peptostreptococcus spp (113), clostridium spp (78), prevotella spp (58), and fusobacterium spp (23). the predominant aerobic bacteria included escherichia coli (83), staphylococcus aureus (61), streptococcus pyogenes (27), streptococcus group d (16), and klebsiella pneumoniae (16). the types of infections included abscesses (109), bacteremia (32), bites (13), empyema (10), osteomyelitis (21), peritonitis (52), thrombophlebitis (12), and wounds (116, including posttraumatic wounds, cellulitis, stump wound, decubitus ulcers, myositis, and fasciitis). s. aureus was isolated at all sites. however, organisms of the oropharyngeal flora predominated in infections that originated from that location (ie, head and neck  wounds, and abscesses or bites), and those of the gastrointestinal flora predominated in infections that originated from that site (ie, peritonitis, abdominal abscesses, decubitus ulcers). this study showed the polymicrobial nature of many infections that follow trauma.

TI  == isolation, cdna cloning and gene expression of an antibacterial protein from larvae of the coconut rhinoceros beetle, oryctes rhinoceros.
AB  == an antibacterial protein, designated rhinocerosin, was purified to homogeneity from larvae of the coconut rhinoceros beetle, oryctes rhinoceros immunized with escherichia coli. based on the amino acid sequence of the n-terminal region, a degenerate primer was synthesized and reverse-transcriptase pcr was performed to  clone rhinocerosin cdna. as a result, a 279-bp fragment was obtained. the complete nucleotide sequence was determined by sequencing the extended rhinocerosin cdna clone by 5' rapid amplification of cdna ends. the deduced amino acid sequence of the mature portion of rhinocerosin was composed of 72 amino acids without cystein residues and was shown to be rich in glycine (11.1%) and proline (11.1%) residues. comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of rhinocerosin with those of other antibacterial proteins indicated that it has 77.8% and 44.6% identity with holotricin 2 and coleoptrecin, respectively. rhinocerosin had strong antibacterial activity against e. coli, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus but not against pseudomonas aeruginosa. results of reverse-transcriptase pcr analysis of gene expression in different tissues indicated that the rhinocerosin gene is strongly expressed in the fat body and the malpighian tubule, and weakly expressed in hemocytes and midgut. in addition, gene expression was inducible by bacteria in the fat body, the malpighian tubule  and hemocyte but constitutive expression was observed in the midgut.

TI  == microbiology of acute otitis media in costa rican children.
AB  == background: because of the increasing number of resistant middle ear pathogens reported from different centers worldwide, an active surveillance of the microbiology and susceptibility pattern of middle ear pathogens is required for proper antimicrobial recommendations among different regions of the world. objective: to study the microbiology and susceptibility pattern of middle ear pathogens obtained from costa rican children with acute otitis media. methods: between 1992 and 1997 a diagnostic tympanocentesis was performed in 398 costa rican patients with acute otitis media. middle ear fluid was obtained for culture and minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by the e-test technique in  those isolates obtained between october, 1995, and january, 1997. results: the most common pathogens cultured were streptococcus pneumoniae (30%), haemophilus influenzae (14%), staphylococcus aureus (4%) and streptococcus pyogenes (4%). moraxella catarrhalis was uncommon. beta-lactamase production was low (3.7%) among the h. influenzae isolates but frequent among the staphylococcus aureus (57.1%) and m. catarrhalis (100%) strains. overall 9 of 46 s. pneumoniae isolates (19.6%) exhibited decreased susceptibility to penicillin of which 8 isolates (17.4%) showed intermediate and one strain (2.2%) high level resistance. among the penicillin-susceptible s. pneumoniae isolates, susceptibility to the following antimicrobials was: 81%, azithromycin; 89%, clarithromycin; and 100%, ceftriaxone and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (tmp-smx). among the penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae isolates the percentage of susceptible strains was 89% for azithromycin, clarithromycin and ceftriaxone and 67% for tmp-smx. conclusions: based on this microbiologic information the agents considered first  line drugs in the treatment of acute otitis media in costa rica remain amoxicillin or tmp-smx.

TI  == azithromycin. a review of its use in paediatric infectious diseases.
AB  == azithromycin is an azalide antimicrobial agent active in vitro against major pathogens responsible for infections of the respiratory tract, skin and soft tissues in children. pathogens that are generally susceptible to azithromycin include haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), moraxella catarrhalis, chlamydia pneumoniae, chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma pneumoniae, legionella spp., streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae. azithromycin is also generally active against erythromycin- and penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus. azithromycin is administered once daily, achieves clinically relevant concentrations at sites of infection, is slowly eliminated from the body and has few drug interactions. in children, azithromycin is usually given as either a 3-day course of 10 mg/kg/day or a 5-day course with 10 mg/kg on the first day, followed by 5 mg/kg/day for a further 4 days. these standard regimens were as effective as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, clarithromycin, cefaclor and amoxicillin in the treatment of children with otitis media. azithromycin was also as effective as either phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin  v), erythromycin, clarithromycin or cefaclor against streptococcal pharyngitis or tonsillitis in children, but appears to result in more recurrence of infection than phenoxymethylpenicillin in this indication, necessitating a dosage of 12 mg/kg/day for 5 days. community-acquired pneumonia, bronchitis and other respiratory tract infections in children responded as well to azithromycin as to  amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefaclor, erythromycin or josamycin. azithromycin was similar or superior to ceftibuten in mixed general practice populations of patients. however, symptoms of lower respiratory tract infections resolved more rapidly with azithromycin than with erythromycin, josamycin or cefaclor. skin and soft tissue infections responded as well to azithromycin as to cefaclor, dicloxacillin or flucloxacillin, and oral azithromycin was as effective as ocular tetracycline in treating trachoma. although not as well tolerated as phenoxymethylpenicillin in the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis, azithromycin is at least as well tolerated as most other agents used to treat respiratory tract and other infections in children and was better tolerated than  amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. adverse events that do occur are mostly gastrointestinal and tend to be mild to moderate in severity. conclusions: azithromycin is an effective and well tolerated alternative to first-line agents  in the treatment of respiratory tract, skin and soft tissue infections in children, offerring the convenience of a short, once-daily regimen.

TI  == mobilization of potent plasma bactericidal activity during systemic bacterial challenge. role of group iia phospholipase a2.
AB  == extracellular mobilization of group iia 14-kd phospholipase a2 (pla2) in glycogen-induced rabbit inflammatory peritoneal exudates is responsible for the potent bactericidal activity of the inflammatory fluid toward staphylococcus aureus (1996. j. clin. invest. 97:250-257). because similar levels of pla2 are induced in plasma during systemic inflammation, we have tested whether this gives rise to plasma bactericidal activity not present in resting animals. baboons were injected intravenously (i.v.) with a lethal dose of escherichia coli and plasma or serum was collected before and at hourly intervals after injection. after infusion of bacteria, pla2 levels in plasma and serum rose > 100-fold over 24 h to approximately 1 microg pla2/ml. serum collected at 24 h possessed potent bactericidal activity toward s. aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and encapsulated  e. coli not exhibited by serum collected from unchallenged animals. bactericidal  activity toward s. aureus and s. pyogenes was nearly completely blocked by a monoclonal antibody to human group iia pla2 and addition of purified human group  iia pla2 to prechallenge serum conferred potent antistaphylococcal and antistreptococcal activity equal to that of the 24 h post-challenge serum. pla2-dependent bactericidal activity was enhanced approximately 10x by factor(s)  present constitutively in serum or plasma. bactericidal activity toward encapsulated e. coli was accompanied by extensive bacterial phospholipid degradation mediated, at least in part, by the mobilized group iia pla2 but depended on the action of other bactericidal factors in the 24-h serum. these findings further demonstrate the contribution of group iia pla2 to the antibacterial potency of biological fluids and suggest that mobilization of this  enzyme during inflammation may play an important role in host defense against invading bacteria.

TI  == the efficacy of antimicrobial mouth rinses in oral health care.
AB  == there is growing public recognition of the importance of oral health, as symbolized by the theme. "oral health for a healthy life" proposed for the 1994 world health day. in this report, the efficacy of antimicrobial mouth rinses, mainly listerine, was reviewed by three investigators who are working as a microbiologist, a microbiologist, a dentist, and a dental hygienist participating in oral health care. listerine, an antimicrobial mouth rinse, completely killed microorganisms in 10 to 30 seconds; the microbes includes methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, helicobacter pylori, candida albicans, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. listerine was also weakly effective in inactivating human immunodeficiency viruses. bacteria in samples collected from human dental plaque and saliva were completely killed within 30 seconds when exposed to listerine. when saliva samples were collected from subjects who had rinsed their mouths with 20 ml of listerine or 1:50 diluted povidone-iodine, levels of viable anaerobic bacteria in the samples were reduced  to 1%. when listerine was used for oral surgery such as tooth extraction and periodontal surgery, the agent was effective in relieving toothache. this was probably due to a decrease in oral bacteria by the antimicrobial action of listerine, leading to lowering the inflammatory response of the host. the use of  antimicrobial mouth rinse during dental treatments such as endodontic treatment proved effective for more reliable infection control. in japan, there are an increasing number of elderly and medically compromised hosts who are potentially  at risk for developing pneumonia due to silent aspiration of microbes in the oral cavity and throat. for the aged with such potential risk, using of antimicrobial  mouth rinse may be effective in preventing dental plaque accumulation when used in addition to the mechanical control of plaque, since they tend to have difficulty in brushing teeth by themselves. indeed, the use of antimicrobial mouth rinse in these elderly people proved useful not only in preventing bacterial pneumonia, but also in improving their quality of life by preserving their oral health.

TI  == a microbiologist's view of factors contributing to infection.
AB  == why some patients develop postoperative surgical wound infection and others do not remains a mystery. there are many risk factors for infection, and mathematical scoring systems are often good predictors of infection; yet, some patients with a plethora of risk factors fail to develop surgical site infections. even patients with established abdominal infection do not automatically develop wound infection. early experimental work, now confirmed in  the clinical setting, dictates that bacteria must be in the wound to cause infection; the minimal infecting dose will depend on the environmental conditions in the wound. the presence of foreign bodies, trauma, hematoma, etc., will enhance the effect of the inoculum; therefore, surgical debridement and careful surgery are necessary to reinforce the host defenses. some bacteria, e.g., staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, have a greater propensity to cause infection, so extensive infection-control practices are necessary to prevent or contain these pathogens. to minimize the risk of surgical site infection, individual patient risk factors must be identified and modified whenever possible. the patient should be prepared for the operation and appropriate skin antiseptics should be used on the operative site. the patient should be considered for perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis and, if appropriate, bowel preparation should be carried out. care and attention to the theater operating environment is important, especially for cases in which airborne transmission of bacteria should be controlled, e.g., ultraclean air systems for implant surgery. in elective surgery, the source of bacteria that cause infection is either the patient's normal flora (e.g., skin or bowel), i.e., endogenous, or the surgical staff or environment, i.e., exogenous. surgical expertise and theater discipline are essential components in the fight against surgical sepsis.

AB  == streptococcal impetigo associated with atopic dermatitis has dramatically increased from 1989 to 1994 in outpatients visiting our hospital, totalling 174 cases. the most frequent causative agents were group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes, 70.7%) followed by group g (19.5%) and group b (9.8%). streptococcus was isolated singly in 28.2% of cases and in concomitant with staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) in 71.8%. major clinical features of streptococcal impetigo, especially caused by group a streptococci, were non-bullous pustules with thick crusted ceiling. impetigo caused by group g or b  streptococci generally formed smaller sized pustules of fewer numbers. impetigo was usually present, associated with severe eczematous lesions. various degrees of fever were noticed in 32.8% (group a, 39.8%; group g, 17.6%; group b, 11.8%) during active stages. the lesions on the face often resembled kaposi's varicelliform eruption in any group. systemic antimicrobial agents were administered in 71.3% of cases and the remainder were treated with topical antibiotics (oxytetracycline hydrochloride) or disinfectants (povidone-iodine). recurrence occurred within a month in 38.0% of cases treated with topical agents  only and in 17.7% treated with systemic antimicrobial agents. antimicrobial susceptibility tests and the results of treatment seem to indicate that cephems,  as well as penicillins, are the first choice of treatment for streptococcal impetigo.

TI  == in-vitro activity of piperacillin and tazobactam combination against clinically significant bacteria.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactum which is not among the routinely tested antibiotic at the public health bacteriology laboratory, parirenyatwa hospital, harare, zimbabwe was evaluated for its activity against bacterial pathogens using the kirby-bauer disk diffusion method. piperacillin/tazobactum showed superior in-vitro activity against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria when compared with routinely tested antibiotics such as gentamicin, erythromycin, tetracycline, penicillin, chloramphenicol, fusidic acid and clindamycin and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). ciprofloxacin showed in-vitro activity comparable to that of tazobactam/piperacillin. specifically, 96% of gram positive isolates (comprising  streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci and streptococcus pneumoniae were sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam. for gram  negative organisms, 98% of haemophilus influenzae shigella spp, klebsiella spp were also sensitive to the combination. the broad spectrum of activity of piperacillin/tazobactam shows that the potential of the drug combination for the  treatment of infections caused by diverse microorganisms should not be underestimated. we recommend its inclusion in routine antibiotic sensitivity testing in our hospital.

TI  == identification and characterization of staphylococcal enterotoxin types g and i from staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == staphylococcal enterotoxins are exotoxins produced by staphylococcus aureus that  possess emetic and superantigenic properties. prior to this research there were six characterized enterotoxins, staphylococcal enterotoxin types a to e and h (referred to as sea to see and seh). two new staphylococcal enterotoxin genes have been identified and designated seg and sei (staphylococcal enterotoxin types g and i, respectively). seg and sei consist of 777 and 729 nucleotides, respectively, encoding precursor proteins of 258 (seg) and 242 (sei) deduced amino acids. seg and sei have typical bacterial signal sequences that are cleaved to form toxins with 233 (seg) and 218 (sei, predicted) amino acids, corresponding to mature proteins of 27,043 da (seg) and 24,928 da (sei). biological activities  for seg and sei were determined with recombinant s. aureus strains. seg and sei elicited emetic responses in rhesus monkeys upon nasogastric administration and stimulated murine t-cell proliferation with the concomitant production of interleukin 2 (il-2) and gamma interferon (ifn-gamma), as measured by cytokine enzyme-linked immunoassays. seg and sei are related to other enterotoxins of s. aureus and to streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin a (spea) and streptococcal superantigen (ssa) of streptococcus pyogenes. phylogenetic analysis and comparisons of amino acid and nucleotide sequence identities were performed on related staphylococcal and streptococcal protein toxins to group seg and sei among the characterized toxins. seg is most similar to spea, seb, sec, and ssa (38 to 42% amino acid identity), while sei is most similar to sea, see, and sed (26 to 28% amino acid identity). polyclonal antiserum was generated against purified histidine-tagged seg and sei (hisseg and hissei). immunoblot analysis of the enterotoxins, toxic-shock syndrome toxin 1, and spea with antiserum prepared  against hisseg and hissei revealed that seg shares some epitopes with sec1 while  sei does not.

TI  == mucin gene (muc 2 and muc 5ac) upregulation by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == bacterial infection of the lung is associated with mucin overproduction. in partial explanation of this phenomenon, we recently reported that supernatant from the gram-negative organism pseudomonas (p.) aeruginosa contained an activity that upregulated transcription of the muc 2 mucin gene [j.-d. li, a. dohrman, m.  gallup, s. miyata, j. gum, y. kim, j. nadel, a. prince, c. basbaum, transcriptional activation of mucin by p. aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis lung disease, proc. natl. acad. sci. u.s.a., 94 (1997) 967-972]. the purpose of the present study was to determine whether mucin  genes other than muc 2 are so regulated and whether gram-positive organisms also  contain mucin stimulatory activity. results from in situ hybridization and rnase  protection assays showed that p. aeruginosa upregulates muc 5ac as well as muc 2  in both bronchial explants and cultured airway epithelial cells. the upregulation of both genes by p. aeruginosa can be mimicked by lipopolysaccharide (lps) and can be blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. in addition, both genes are upregulated by a variety of gram-positive as well as gram-negative organisms showing the same rank order of potency. these data indicate the existence of a general mechanism by which epithelial cells respond to the presence of bacteria by increasing mucin synthesis.

TI  == peripheral blood lymphocytes from psoriatic patients are hyporesponsive to beta-streptococcal superantigens.
AB  == the strong association of acute guttate psoriasis and streptococcal throat infection, together with the preferential use of t cells expressing a particular  t-cell receptor, has suggested a role for bacterial superantigens in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. we examined the proliferative responses of peripheral  blood lymphocytes (pbls), obtained from patients with psoriasis and from healthy  controls, to streptococcal superantigens, cytoplasmic membrane-associated protein (cap) and secretion-type cap (scap), isolated from group a, beta-haemolytic streptococci. pbls from patients with psoriasis showed significantly less response to scap and cap than those from healthy controls. because there was no difference between psoriatic patients and controls in the proliferative response  of pbls to staphylococcal enterotoxin a or e (sea, see) or the mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (pha), these findings strongly suggest that the reduced reactivity to the streptococcal superantigens seems to reflect anergy of a population of pbls to the superantigens. as the cap used in the present study stimulates v beta 8 t cells selectively, we further examined the proliferation of v beta 8 t cells after such stimulation using flow cytometry. v beta 8 t cells obtained from three of four psoriatic patients failed to proliferate in the presence of cap, whereas they proliferated vigorously in the presence of see, which activates v beta 8 t cells, confirming the specific hyporesponsiveness of pbls from psoriatic patients to streptococcal superantigens. we then determined the effects of serum factors on the suppressed response of pbls to the streptococcal superantigens with scap or cap. it was partially restored when pbls were cultured with sera obtained from healthy subjects, although the responses were still significantly lower than those of the healthy controls. in contrast, psoriatic sera markedly suppressed the proliferative response of pbls from healthy controls to cap or scap, but showed no suppression of the proliferative response of pbls to sea. because these findings suggest the presence of specific  inhibitory factors in psoriatic sera, we examined whether the inhibitory effect was caused by antisuperantigen antibody. however, no significant increase was detected in antibody titre to cap in psoriatic sera, as has been noted in sera from patients with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. the present results show for the first time the hyporesponsiveness of pbls to streptococcal superantigens  and the presence of serum inhibitors that specifically inhibit t-cell response to the superantigens in psoriatic patients. these findings suggest a pathological role for streptococcal infections in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.

TI  == bacteria and viruses that cause respiratory tract infections during the pilgrimage (haj) season in makkah, saudi arabia.
AB  == objective: to determine the incidence and type of rti-causing bacteria and viruses during a period of epidemic infections. method: a total of 395 sputum specimens and 761 throat swabs were collected during the 1991 and 1992 pilgrimage seasons (haj to makkah al-mukarama, saudi arabia) from patients referred to one hospital and three dispensaries with symptoms of respiratory tract infections. all 761 throat swabs of both haj seasons were also screened for the presence of viral pathogens with monoclonal antibodies specific for 7 viruses known to cause  respiratory infections. results: bacterial pathogens were detected in 118 (29.9%) specimens. during the 1991 haj season haemophilus influenzae was the most frequent bacterial pathogen detected (10%), followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (5.2%), streptococcus pneumoniae (4.8%), staphylococcus aureus (3.8%) and streptococcus pyogenes (2.4%). in the 1992 haj season klebsiella pneumoniae was predominant (15.1%), followed by haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae (12.3%). screening of all sputum specimens for acid-fast bacteria showed that the overall incidence rate of tuberculosis was 1%. cultures from the  761 throat swabs were largely negative for bacteria except for streptococcus pyogenes isolated from 7 patients. viruses were detected in 148 (19.5%) specimens with influenza a and adenovirus being the most common viruses. conclusion: the pattern of virus prevalence in the 1991 and 1992 pilgrimage seasons was identical: influenza a and adenovirus predominated. thus these two viruses should be targeted in future prophylactic measures.

AB  == our previous studies have shown that streptococcal igg fc receptors (fcr) act to  elicit circulating anti-igg as well as renal glomerular deposition of igg in rabbits immunized with group a streptococci (gas). in order to study if other fcr-positive bacteria might have similar effects, rabbits were immunized with either group g streptococci (ggs; strain g148) or staphylococcus aureus (strain cowan i) for two periods of 8 and 6 weeks, respectively. at the end of immunization, circulating anti-igg was found in 6 of 20 (30%) and 4 of 19 (21%) animals receiving g148 and cowan i, respectively, compared to all 28 receiving fcr-positive gas strains of types m1, m4, m15 or m22 (p < 0.05 for both comparisons); furthermore, anti-igg appeared earlier and at higher levels in the  gas groups. weak glomerular igg deposits occurred in 5 out of 10 (50%) and 2 out  of 8 (25%) animals immunized with g148 and cowan i, respectively. in contrast, all 11 rabbits examined, given gas of types m1 or m15, displayed heavy deposits.  none of four control animals immunized with either of two fcr-negative strains, gas type t27 or group b streptococci (gbs) type ia, exhibited any renal igg deposits or circulating anti-igg. renal tissue materials from rabbits immunized with any of the four fcr-positive gas strains showed strong inflammatory and degenerative glomerular changes, compatible with the picture seen in acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (apsgn). only transient renal changes were found in those rabbits immunized with g148 or cowan i, or the controls injected with the fcr-negative strains, gas type t27 or gbs. thus, only the fcr-positive gas strains showed capacity to induce high levels of anti-igg, pronounced tissue  deposition of igg as well as irreversible glomerular changes. our experimental data suggest that streptococcal igg fcr activity might play an important role in  triggering apsgn.

TI  == a novel erythromycin resistance methylase gene (ermtr) in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == erythromycin resistance among streptococci is commonly due to target site modification by an rrna-methylating enzyme, which results in coresistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b antibiotics (mlsb resistance). genes  belonging to the ermam (ermb) gene class are the only erythromycin resistance methylase (erm) genes in streptococcus pyogenes with mlsb resistance that have been sequenced so far. we identified a novel erm gene, designated ermtr, from an  erythromycin-resistant clinical strain of s. pyogenes (strain a200) with an inducible type of mlsb resistance. the nucleotide sequence of ermtr is 82.5% identical to erma, previously found, for example, in staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. our finding provides the first sequence of an erm gene other than ermam that mediates mlsb resistance in s. pyogenes.

AB  == a strain of streptococcus agalactiae displayed resistance to 14-, 15-, and 16-membered macrolides. in pcr assays, total genomic dna from this strain contained neither erm nor mef genes. ecori-digested genomic dna from this strain  was cloned into lambda zap ii to construct a library of s. agalactiae genomic dna. a clone, paes63, expressing resistance to erythromycin, azithromycin, and spiramycin in escherichia coli was recovered. deletion derivatives of paes63 which defined a functional region on this clone that encoded resistance to 14- and 15-membered, but not 16-membered, macrolides were produced. studies that determined the levels of incorporation of radiolabelled erythromycin into e. coli were consistent with the presence of a macrolide efflux determinant. this putative efflux determinant was distinct from the recently described mef pump in  streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae and from the multicomponent msra pump in staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. its gene has been designated mrea (for macrolide resistance efflux).

TI  == [comparative antimicrobial activity of rp 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin), the first semisynthetic injectable streptgramin, against gram-positive cocci and other recent clinical pathogens].
AB  == rp 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin) is the first semisynthetic injectable streptogramin antimicrobial agent, which is a combination of quinupristin and dalfopristin in a 30:70 ratio. the components of rp 59,500 act synergically to provide bactericidal activity through action at different sites on bacterial ribosomes. in the present study, the antimicrobial activity of rp 59,500 was compared with those of four macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin). susceptibility testing was carried out by microdilution method on 303 strains of 10 species, especially antibiotic-resistant gram-positive cocci. rp 59,500 was active against a wide range of gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the mics90 of rp 59,500 against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis were both 0.25 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. the mics90 of rp 59,500 against penicillin-sensitive, -intermediate and -resistant s. pneumoniae were all 0.5 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. rp 59,500 also exhibited equivalent activities to the four macrolides against strains of streptococcus pyogenes. streptococcus agalactiae and moraxella catarrhalis. rp 59,500 exhibited the highest activities against enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus avium strains which  are intrinsically resistant to most antimicrobial agents. no cross-resistance was observed between rp 59,500 and the four macrolides, which will merit attention in future clinical trials of the agent. the effect of human serum on the mic of rp 59,500 was studied with strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. faecalis. the presence of 20% (v/v) serum had little or no effect on the mic, although 50% (v/v) serum increased mics by 4-8 folds. laboratory-induced resistance to rp 59,500 occurred in a stepwise fashion in broth cultures of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. facalis strains and the induction rate was slow and no more than four fold increases were observed. population analysis was performed on rp 59,500 and the reference macrolides against s. aureus atcc 25,923 strain. although low frequencies (less than 0.01%) of resistant sub-population were detected with em, cam, azm and rxm, no rp 59,500-resistant sub-population was detected in this study.

TI  == periocular necrotizing fasciitis: a review of five cases.
AB  == objective: the purpose of the study is to display a spectrum of clinical presentations of periocular necrotizing fasciitis caused by group a streptococci  and to discuss recent trends and treatment of this disease. design and intervention: a case series of five patients (four female and one male) was seen  between july 1990 and january 1995 in four university centers. all had clinical evidence of periocular necrotizing fasciitis and grew group a streptococci on wound cultures or had serologic evidence of streptococcal infection. details of patient presentation, treatment, and outcome are examined. results: the five patients showed a spectrum of clinical severity from a necrotizing infection confined to the eyelid to a potentially fatal, severe shock-like syndrome characterized by sepsis and multiorgan system failure. a history of trauma often  was absent. patients were treated successfully by a combination of appropriate antibiotics and surgical debridement. conclusions: group a streptococci can cause severe necrotizing infections of the eyelids. early recognition and prompt treatment can be essential to these patients' survival.

TI  == in vitro activity of trimethoprim alone compared with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and other antimicrobials against bacterial species  associated with upper respiratory tract infections.
AB  == trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been used to treat various respiratory tract infections. nevertheless, for many patients, intolerance of the sulfonamide component precludes use of this combination. this study examined the activity of  trimethoprim alone in comparison to that of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and other antimicrobials against bacterial species implicated in respiratory tract infections. for haemophilus influenzae, minimal inhibitory concentrations of trimethoprim were equal to or one dilution greater than those of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, with 56 of 58 strains inhibited by the former at < or = 0.25 microgram/ml. all oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and 96.7% of streptococcus pyogenes were inhibited by trimethoprim < or = 2 micrograms/ml.  in contrast, only 50% of streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by this concentration of trimethoprim, whereas 93.3% were susceptible to the combination  at < or = 2/38 micrograms/ml. all oxacillin-resistant s. aureus and all moraxella catarrhalis were resistant to trimethoprim, although many of the former and all of the latter were susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

AB  == we investigated the clinical efficacy in pediatrics sinusitis infections of cefditoren pivoxil granule therapy and its in vitro antibacterial activity against clinically isolated strains. the results are summarized as follows. the specimens from 343 patients were cultured and 595 strains of bacteria were isolated and identified. oral doses of 3 and 5 mg/kg of cdtr-pi were clinically effective at high percentages, 85.1% and 89.5%, respectively, of treated patients. cdtr-pi at 3 mg/kg orally was clinically effective in 80.8% of patients with pcg intermediate s. pneumoniae (pisp) infections, 80.0% of those with pcg susceptible s. pneumoniae (pssp) infections, 81.8% of those with h. influenzae infections and 78.3% of those with m. (b.) catarrhalis infections among the infections by major causative agents. the frequent isolates included s. pneumoniae accounting for 33.1%, h. influenzae accounting for 32.1%, m. (b.) catarrhalis accounting for 17.6% and s. pyogenes accounting 3.7% of all the isolates. pisp accounted for 16.1% of all the isolates and for 49.8% of the isolates of s. pneumoniae, and were isolated from 28.6% of the 343 patients. the  isolation of pisp was frequent from children of 4 and under especially, and especially frequent from those below age 2. of the isolates of s. pneumoniae, the biotype frequencies among pssp were in the order of type i > type ii > type iii,  while those among pisp were in the order of type i < type ii with none of type iii. bacteriologically, an eradication rate of 89.4% was achieved with 3 mg/kg and 93.5% with 5 mg/kg of cdtr-pi.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of roxithromycin against recently obtained clinical isolates].
AB  == the purpose of our investigation was to monitor current trends in the susceptibility patterns of clinical bacterial isolates to roxithromycin (rxm). we measured the mics of macrolide antibiotics, such as rxm, erythromycin (em), clarithromycin (cam), rokitamycin (rkm) and midecamycin (mdm), and other classes  of antibacterial compounds against various clinical isolates at seven institutions between october and december in 1994 and 1995. rxm had excellent antibacterial activities for s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, m. (b.) catarrhalis and  methicillin sensitive s. aureus. against methicillin sensitive s. epidermidis, rxm activity was fairly good but about 20% of the strains had mic > or = 128 micrograms/ml. the activity against s. pneumoniae was not so potent and similar to activities of em, cam, mdm, and clindamycin. the vast majority of methicillin  resistant s. aureus and s. epidermidis were also resistant to macrolide antibiotics and other classes of compounds tested. in conclusion, rxm is an unique macrolide antibiotic by retaining potent activity against s. pyogenes, s.  agalactiae, s. aureus except mrsa, m. (b.) catarrhalis and m. pneumoniae.

TI  == group a streptococcal bacteremia. a 10-year prospective study.
AB  == in this paper we present a prospective evaluation of 100 patients with group a streptococcal (gas) bacteremia evaluated in our hospital over a 10-year period. sixty-two patients were intravenous drug users (ivdu); all but 1 of these had an  obvious cutaneous portal of entry related to the injection of illicit drugs. twenty-seven patients had infectious metastasis, and the presence of septic pulmonary embolism was associated with suppurative phlebitis. four of these patients had endocarditis. in the non-ivdu group, 24 patients had an underlying disease, and 12 were immunosuppressed. in 14 cases the infection was of hospital  acquisition; in 35% infection was related to medical manipulations. comparing the ivdu and non-ivdu groups, gas bacteremia in ivdu patients is associated with a more benign outcome, a longer time of evolution before diagnosis, and a lower frequency of septic shock and mortality than in non-ivdu patients. although in the univariate analysis gas bacteremia was associated with several variables, in  the multivariate analysis only the presence of shock and nosocomial acquisition of the infection were independently associated with a fatal outcome. fifty-two patients were infected with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv); 5 of these were in the non-ivdu group. during the last 5 years of study, gas bacteremia in our hospital was 39 times more frequent in hiv-infected patients than in patients without hiv. nine patients presented clinical criteria corresponding to streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (stss), although its incidence was lower in the ivdu group. in the non-ivdu group, stss was more frequent in patients with a  necrotizing portal of entry, an age between 20 and 40 years, women, and when the  origin of the infection was the skin or soft tissue. six patients with stss died, and death was associated with the presence of necrotizing lesions and lower counts of white cells, platelets, or hemoglobin.

AB  == the in vitro production of interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), il-6, and the il-1 receptor antagonist (il-1ra) in whole blood upon stimulation with different bacterial strains was measured to study the possible relationship between disease severity and the cytokine-inducing capacities of these strains. escherichia coli, neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, bacteroides fragilis, capnocytophaga canimorsus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes induced the cytokines il-1beta, il-6, and il-1ra. gram-negative bacteria induced significantly higher levels of proinflammatory cytokine production than gram-positive bacteria. these  differences were less pronounced for the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-1ra. in addition, blood was stimulated with e. coli killed by different antibiotics to study the effect of the antibiotics on the cytokine-inducing capacity of the bacterial culture. e. coli treated with cefuroxime and gentamicin induced higher  levels of il-1beta and il-6 production but levels of il-1ra production similar to that of heat-killed e. coli. in contrast, ciprofloxacin- and imipenem-cilastatin-mediated killing showed a decreased or similar level of induction of cytokine production as compared to that by heat-killed e. coli; polymyxin b decreased the level of production of the cytokines.

TI  == increased intracellular survival of mycobacterium smegmatis containing the mycobacterium leprae thioredoxin-thioredoxin reductase gene.
AB  == the thioredoxin (trx) system of mycobacterium leprae is expressed as a single hybrid protein containing thioredoxin reductase (tr) at its n terminus and trx at its c terminus. this hybrid trx system is unique to m. leprae, since in all other organisms studied to date, including other mycobacteria, both tr and trx are expressed as two separate proteins. because trx has been shown to scavenge reactive oxygen species, we have investigated whether the tr-trx gene product can inhibit oxygen-dependent killing of mycobacteria by human mononuclear phagocytes  and as such could contribute to mycobacterial virulence. the gene encoding m. leprae tr-trx was cloned into the apathogenic, fast-growing bacterium mycobacterium smegmatis. recombinant m. smegmatis containing the gene encoding tr-trx was killed to a significantly lesser extent than m. smegmatis containing the identical vector with either no insert or a control m. leprae construct unrelated to tr-trx. upon phagocytosis, m. smegmatis was shown to be killed predominantly by oxygen-dependent macrophage-killing mechanisms. coinfection of m. smegmatis expressing the gene encoding tr-trx together with staphylococcus aureus, which is known to be killed via oxygen-dependent microbicidal mechanisms, revealed that the tr-trx gene product interferes with the intracellular killing of this bacterium. a similar coinfection with streptococcus pyogenes, known to be killed by oxygen-independent mechanisms, showed that the tr-trx gene product did  not influence the oxygen-independent killing pathway. the data obtained in this study suggest that the trx system of m. leprae can inhibit oxygen-dependent killing of intracellular bacteria and thus may represent one of the mechanisms by which m. leprae can deal with oxidative stress within human mononuclear phagocytes.

TI  == clarithromycin. a review of its efficacy in the treatment of respiratory tract infections in immunocompetent patients.
AB  == clarithromycin is a broad spectrum macrolide antibacterial agent active in vitro  and effective in vivo against the major pathogens responsible for respiratory tract infections in immunocompetent patients. it is highly active in vitro against pathogens causing atypical pneumonia (chlamydia pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae and legionella spp.) and has similar activity to other macrolides against staphylococcus aureus. streptococcus pyogenes, moraxella catarrhalis and  streptococcus pneumoniae. haemophilus influenzae is susceptible or intermediately susceptible to clarithromycin alone, but activity is enhanced when the parent drug and metabolite are combined in vitro. absorption of clarithromycin is unaffected by food. more than half of an oral dose is systemically available as the parent drug and the active 14-hydroxy metabolite. pharmacokinetics are nonlinear, with plasma concentrations increasing in more than proportion to the dosage. first-pass metabolism results in the rapid appearance of the active metabolite 14-hydroxy-clarithromycin in plasma. clarithromycin and its active metabolite are found in greater concentrations in the tissues and fluids of the respiratory tract than in plasma. dosage adjustments are required for patients with severe renal failure, but not for elderly patients or those with hepatic impairment. drug interactions related to the cytochrome p450 system may occur with clarithromycin use. in addition to the standard immediate-release formulation for administration twice daily, a modified-release formulation of clarithromycin is now available for use once daily. in dosages of 500 to 1000 mg/day for 5 to 14 days, clarithromycin was as effective in the treatment of community-acquired upper and lower respiratory tract infections in hospital and community settings as beta-lactam agents (with or without a beta-lactamase inhibitor), cephalosporins and most other macrolides. clarithromycin was similar  in efficacy to azithromycin in comparative studies and is as effective as and better tolerated than erythromycin. adverse events are primarily gastrointestinal in nature, but result in fewer withdrawals from therapy than are seen with erythromycin. clarithromycin provides similar clinical and bacteriological efficacy to that seen with beta-lactam agents, cephalosporins and other macrolides. it offers a cost-saving alternative to intravenous erythromycin use in us hospitals and is available in both once-daily and twice-daily formulations. the spectrum of activity of clarithromycin against common and emerging respiratory tract pathogens may make it suitable for use in the community as empirical therapy of respiratory tract infections in both children and adults.

TI  == gram-positive resistance: challenge for the development of new antibiotics.
AB  == the incidence of infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-positive organisms is increasing despite advances in antibacterial therapy over the last 20 years. as the pathogens causing these infections are frequently resistant to most currently available antibacterials, they are extremely difficult to treat. problematic pathogens include strains of streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to beta-lactams and macrolides, viridans group streptococci resistant to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides, enterococci resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin and highly resistant to penicillins and aminoglycosides, and staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, other beta-lactams, macrolides, lincosamides and aminoglycosides. other important pathogens include streptococcus pyogenes resistant to macrolides (and suspected to be resistant to penicillin), macrolide-resistant streptococci of groups b, c, and g, coagulase-negative staphylococci resistant to beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, macrolides, lincosamides and glycopeptides, multiresistant strains of listeria and corynebacterium and gram-positive anaerobes, such as peptostreptococcus and clostridium, resistant to penicillins and macrolides. thus, there is an urgent need for new antibacterial agents that are able to overcome multidrug-resistant mechanisms. the novel semisynthetic injectable streptogramin quinupristin/dalfopristin offers the prospect of effective treatment against many of the above pathogens.

AB  == summer mastitis is an acute suppurative bacterial infection of the udder in heifers and dry cows. to ascertain the possible role of flies in the transmission of the disease, experimental exposures of recipient heifers to hydrotaea irritans previously exposed to bacteria were carried out. flies were allowed to feed on secretions from clinical cases of summer mastitis. the pathogens present were the bacteria staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus dysgalactiae, actinomyces pyogenes, stuart-schwan cocci, peptococcus indolicus, fusobacterium necrophorum and bacterioides species. the teats of eight heifers were exposed to flies with verified pathogen content. two teats of each animal were deliberately damaged before fly exposure. one teat was cut, another pricked with insect needles to mimic insect bites. two of the heifers developed summer mastitis in the quarters  where teats had been cut. the bacterial species isolated from these quarters corresponded to those that had previously been fed to the flies. for the first time, it is now demonstrated that h.irritans is capable of transmitting summer mastitis pathogens and so causing summer mastitis in recipient heifers. lesions on the teat orifice may be a predisposing factor in the development of the disease.

TI  == insertional inactivation of streptolysin s expression is associated with altered  riboflavin metabolism in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == transposon tn916 mutagenesis was used to create a mutant of streptococcus pyogenes m type 3, designated iss417, in which the ability to produce streptolysin s (sls) and several other exoproteins was impaired. concomitantly, the mutant became dependent upon riboflavin for growth and was able to grow in todd hewitt broth (thb) when supplemented with riboflavin or riboflavinrich yeast extract. the parent strain was apparently able to utilize thb-derived components  as a substitute for riboflavin, while the mutant was not. although the parent strain grew well in synthetic medium, it was unable to produce sls, except when it was supplemented with a small amount of thb. thus, a component of thb was able to "trigger" sls formation in the parent strain. the mutant grew well in this medium, but was unable to produce sls even when it was supplemented with thb. southern hybridization analysis revealed that the iss417 mutant harbours a single transposon insertion in its chromosome. phage transduction experiments showed that the riboflavin dependency and the inability to make sls phenotypes are co-transducible. the pleotrophic properties of the iss417 mutant differ from those reported for insertional inactivation of the mga locus which regulates production of a number of surface proteins in s. pyogenes and the sar locus which regulates production of a number of exoproteins in staphylococcus aureus. in view of the possibility that there exist a genetic linkage between the riboflavin biosynthetic pathway and expression of the oxygen-stable sls, we hypothesize that sls has a role in the growth economy of s. pyogenes.

AB  == azithromycin (azm), a new oral macrolide antibiotic, in 10% fine granules or 100  mg capsules was given to pediatric patients to treat various infections. the following results were obtained in our studies of azm for its antibacterial activities against clinical isolates, its pharmacokinetics, its efficacy, and its safety. 1. mics of azm, erythromycin (em) and clarithromycin (cam) were determined against a total of 57 strains all at 10(6) cfu/ml. among gram-positive cocci, mics of azm ranged from 0.78 to > 100 micrograms/ml against staphylococcus aureus (20 strains), from 0.05 to 0.1 microgram/ml against streptococcus pyogenes (11 strains), and from 0.0125 to 3.13 micrograms/ml against streptococcus pneumoniae (10 strains). these mics were similar to those of the other macrolides. among gram-negative bacilli, mics of azm were 0.05 micrograms/ml against moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis (1 strain), from 0.78 to 3.13  micrograms/ml against haemophilus influenzae (9 strains), 0.78 micrograms/ml against haemophilus parainfluenzae (1 strain) and 6.25 micrograms/ml against salmonella sp. (1 strain). these values were similar to or lower than those of the other macrolides. against mycoplasma pneumoniae, mics of azm were < or = 0.0008 micrograms/ml in three strains. one strain of m. pneumoniae showed tolerance to azm at mic 25 micrograms/ml. the other agents exhibited higher mic than azm against this organism. 2. plasma samples were collected from five patients receiving fine granules and four patients receiving capsules for drug level determination. the patients received azm at 10.0 approximately 16.3 mg/kg body weight once daily for 3 days. drug concentrations in plasma at two hours after day 3 dosing were in a range between 0.02 and 0.19 micrograms/ml for fine granules and were in a range between 0.11 and 0.42 micrograms/ml for capsules. 3. urine samples were collected from four patients receiving fine granules and four  patients receiving capsules. drug levels were determined to be 3 micrograms/ml at post-treatment 48 hours for fine granules and post-treatment 72 hours for capsules. urinary excretion rates of azm in three patients on capsules lied in a  range between 4.69 and 10.17%. 4. effectiveness of azm in fine granules was evaluated in 128 patients having a total of 19 different infections. azm was rated "excellent" in 51 patients, "good" in 63, "fair" in 8, "poor" in 6, resulting in an efficacy rate of 89.1%. effectiveness of azm in capsular form was evaluated in 23 patients with five different infections. azm was found "excellent" in 13 patients and "good" in 10, resulting in an efficacy rate of 100%. 5. azm in fine granules eradicated 45 strains of 54 in 8 different bacteria. azm in capsules eradicated 9 strains of 10 strains in 6 different bacteria. 6. as for adverse reactions, one patient complained of eruption, one vomiting, one loose stool, five diarrhea, when administered with fine granular form of azm. one patient on azm capsules experienced urticaria and vomiting. 7. as for abnormal laboratory changes, three patients were found with decreased wbc, seven with increased eosinophil, two with increased got and gpt, one with increased gpt. they were all on fine granular form of azm. as far as abnormalities found in patients administered with azm in capsular form, two showed decreased wbc, one decreased wbc along with increased eosinophil, and three increased eosinophil.

TI  == role of coagulase in a murine model of hematogenous pulmonary infection induced by intravenous injection of staphylococcus aureus enmeshed in agar beads.
AB  == we describe a novel mouse model of acute staphylococcal pneumonia induced by intravenous injection of staphylococcus aureus enmeshed in agar beads. for comparison, we also used various strains of bacteria, including three strains of  s. aureus, two strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, one strain of streptococcus pyogenes, three strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one strain of klebsiella pneumoniae. all except two strains of s. aureus were cleared rapidly from the lungs. when s. aureus numr1 enmeshed in agar beads was injected intravenously, the organisms concentrated and remained in the lung for a period longer than several weeks. multiple lung abscesses were evident macroscopically, and histological examination of the infected lung showed multiple lung abscesses around the pulmonary arterioles, consisting of bacterial colonies encircled with  fibrin filaments and surrounded by inflammatory cells of neutrophils and macrophages. when 14 strains of clinically isolated s. aureus were injected intravenously, the number of bacteria recovered from the lung tissue 7 days after infection correlated with the titer of staphylocoagulase (p < 0.01) but not with  the titer of clumping factor. injection of coagulase-deficient mutant strain du5843 was associated with a markedly reduced number of viable bacteria isolated  from the lung, compared with its coagulase-positive parental strain du5789. our results suggest that coagulase may play a role in the development of blood-borne  staphylococcal pneumonia in our model. our animal model is simple and reproducible and resembles blood-borne staphylococcal pneumonia in humans, and it could be useful for investigating the pathogenicity or treatment of staphylococcal pulmonary infection, including infections with methicillin-resistant s. aureus.

TI  == synthesis and antibacterial action of cecropin and proline-arginine-rich peptides from pig intestine.
AB  == two antimicrobial peptides, cecropin p1 (cp1), with a c-terminal carboxyl group,  and pr-39, with an amidated, c-terminus, are found in the small intestine of the  pig. each is active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. we have synthesized these peptides and several analogs, including the d-enantiomers  and the retro sequences, each with a free or acetylated amino terminus. the cp1 amide was also prepared. the retro cp1 peptides were much less active than the parent cp1 peptide, confirming the importance of sequence or the amide bond and helix dipole direction, and the n alpha-acetyl peptides were also less active, indicating that a free amino terminus is essential for high activity. the ratio of the lethal concentration of l/d isomers of cp1 is less than 1 for gram-negative, but greater than 1 for gram-positive bacteria. pr-39 showed no significant chiral selectivity toward escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis and streptococcus pyogenes, but the l/d ratio was high for pseudomonas aeruginosa (66), and very high for staphylococcus aureus (> 1000). in the latter case the lethal concentration for the d-isomer was 0.57 microm, whereas this organism was  quite resistant to the l-isomer (> 600 microm). thus the enantiomers of cp1 and pr-39 are not equally active for all species. in a plate assay with a very small  log-phase inoculum of staph aureus, d-pr-39 produced a clear zone of killing surrounded by a zone of stimulated growth. after prolonged incubation the two zones became one clear zone. addition of d-pr-39 to the wells of a dense turbid plate of growing cells showed a cleared zone for each of the test organisms, indicating that pr-39 lyses the bacteria rather than simply inhibiting their multiplication.

TI  == a highly discriminatory method for the direct comparison of two closely related bacterial populations by pyrolysis mass spectrometry.
AB  == the ability of pyrolysis mass spectrometry (py-ms) to discriminate between paired groups of closely related bacteria has been examined. the technique was challenged with increasing levels of biological difference; from that between different subcultures of the same isolate of staphylococcus aureus, through that  between separate isolates of the same strain and eventually to that between different staphylococcal species and streptococcus pyogenes. by using an analytical method in which the spectral data from any two groups can be directly  compared at a time, it was shown that py-ms was capable of measuring statistically significant differences between staphylococci and streptococcus pyogenes, between different staphylococcus species and between two isolates of the same strain of s. aureus from different sources. two subcultures of the same  isolate were found to be indistinguishable. the differing magnitude of the py-ms-derived differences corresponded to the "biological differences", being much larger between staphylococci and streptococci than between staphylococcal species and only just statistically significant between isolates of the same strain from different sources. the technique described allows the assessment of the magnitude and significance of py-ms-derived differences between any two bacterial populations.

TI  == binding of staphylococcus aureus to fibronectin and glycolipids on corneal surfaces.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is one of the most common pathogens of bacterial corneal ulcers. it is generally believed that the first step necessary in the development of an infection involves adherence of bacteria to host tissue. the mechanisms by  which staphylococci adhere to ocular epithelium have not yet been defined. an in  vitro assay was used to measure binding of s. aureus and streptococcus pyogenes to a cornea epithelial cell line. reduction of the amount of cell-surface fibronectin by proteinase treatment decreased the adherence of s. pyogenes to a greater degree than that of s. aureus. the significantly higher number of staphylococci adhering to the cells as compared with s. pyogenes (p < 0.001) suggests the presence of additional binding sites for s. aureus. using a thin-layer chromatogram overlay assay, we showed binding of s. aureus to various  glycolipids extracted from corneal epithelial cells and corneal tissue. s. aureus was found to bind to gangliosides and asialo-gm1, whereas s. pyogenes did not bind to any of these complex lipids. the increased adherence potential of s. aureus due to the ability to bind to glycolipids may provide a selective advantage for s. aureus and explain the prevalence of this organism in bacterial  corneal ulcers.

TI  == evaluation of swirling, ph, and glucose tests for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: although infrequent, episodes of transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis may lead to serious outcomes or death and therefore are of concern. this study evaluates the sensitivity of three surrogate tests for the presence of bacteria in platelet concentrates: cessation of swirling, low extracellular ph, and low plasma glucose levels. study design and methods: day 0 platelet concentrates were inoculated with low levels of one of seven bacterial strains and stored with agitation at 20 to 24 degrees c for up to 5 days. in the morning  and afternoon of each day of storage, bacterial levels were ascertained by quantitative plate culture, and platelet concentrates were tested for platelet ph, plasma glucose, and swirling. quantitative and semiquantitative dipstick techniques were used to determine ph and glucose levels. results: platelet concentrates had attained stationary phase growth of streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus mitis, or staphylococcus epidermidis (> or = 10(7) -10(8) colony-forming units [cfu]/ml) before either the swirling or dipstick methods suggested the presence of bacteria. the sensitivity of swirling and glucose tests for detecting bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates was generally comparable. although the sensitivity of the ph test was generally similar to that of swirling and glucose tests for most bacteria, platelet concentrates contaminated with e. cloacae had normal ph despite the presence of high levels of bacteria (> or = 10(7)-10(8) cfu/ml). conclusion: the sensitivity in detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates by the swirling technique or by measuring extracellular ph or plasma glucose is less than the sensitivity reported for microscopy with gram stain (10(5)-10(6) cfu/ml), fluorescence microscopy with acridine orange stain (10(4)-10(5) cfu/ml), chemiluminescence detection of ribosomal rna (10(3)-10(4) cfu/ml), and automated bacterial culture (1 cfu/sample volume).

AB  == varicella, commonly known as chickenpox, is a common viral infection in children. an estimated 3.5 million cases occur annually in the united states. serious musculoskeletal complications such as osteomyelitis and necrotizing fasciitis, although uncommon, can be life and limb-threatening. the purpose of the current study was to determine the association between varicella and serious musculoskeletal complications necessitating operative treatment and to characterize these infections in otherwise healthy children. we retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients who had been admitted to the children's hospital in san diego because of varicella and its complications during the eleven-year period from 1984 through 1994. all records with an inpatient discharge diagnosis code for varicella were identified. twenty-seven (6 per cent) of the 417 admissions for varicella were for musculoskeletal complications of the disease necessitating operative treatment. there were seven admissions for osteomyelitis, four for septic arthritis, five for necrotizing fasciitis, ten for a deep-tissue abscess, and one for toxic shock syndrome leading to multiple limb  amputations. seventy-nine (19 per cent) of the 417 admissions occurred in 1994. eleven (41 per cent) of the twenty-seven musculoskeletal complications that led to operative treatment occurred in 1994, representing a significant increase in the number of such complications compared with the numbers in previous years of the study (p < 0.01). bacterial pathogens were identified as the cause of twenty-five of the twenty-seven complications that led to operative treatment. of these twenty-five, twenty-one (84 per cent) were found, on culture, to be caused  by group-a beta-hemolytic streptococcus. this pathogen was the cause of the infection in five of the seven patients who had osteomyelitis while staphylococcus aureus was the cause in only one. group-a beta-hemolytic streptococcus was also the causative organism in two of the four patients who had septic arthritis, three of the five who had necrotizing fasciitis, and all ten who had a deep-tissue abscess. nine of the eleven musculoskeletal complications leading to operative treatment in 1994 had group-a beta-hemolytic streptococcus as the causative organism. an understanding of the trends of and a high level of  suspicion for potentially serious secondary infections in children who have varicella is necessary for prompt recognition and appropriate treatment.

TI  == isolation, antimicrobial activities, and primary structures of hamster neutrophil defensins.
AB  == hamster (mesocricetus auratus) neutrophil granules contain at least four microbicidal peptides belonging to the defensin family. these compounds were purified from granule acid extracts by reverse-phase chromatography and termed hanp-1 to -4 (hamster neutrophil peptide). hanp-1 and hanp-3 revealed the most bactericidal activity, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.3 to 0.8 microg/ml for staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes strains. the hanp-4 was always isolated in concentrations exceeding about 10 times the concentrations of other hamster peptides, but its antibacterial activity as well  as that of hanp-2 was relatively lower, probably as a result of conserved arg residue substitutions. other microorganisms were also tested, and generally, hamster defensins exhibited less potency against gram-negative bacteria. the amino acid sequence of hamster defensins showed a high percentage of identity to  the sequence of mouse enteric defensins, reaching about 60% identical residues in the case of hanp-3 and cryptdin 3.

AB  == a fourteen-year-old girl with acute otitis media died from gram positive sepsis and toxic shock despite intensive treatment. the definitive bacteriological results showed positive cultures for both s. aureus and s. pyogenes serotype a. in vitro the bacteria produced the bacterial superantigens tsst-1, enterotoxin a, enterotoxin c (s. aureus) and erythrogenic toxin c (s. pyogenes). the patient presented with large flaccid sterile bullae on her chest and arms as well as necrotizing fasciitis. tzanck test showed keratinozytes without necrosis and no inflammatory cells. frozen-section and conventional skin biopsy specimens revealed subcorneal intraepidermal cleavage. these cytological and histological findings are those of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (ssss) and differ from bullous erysipelas or toxic epidermal necrolysis (ten). therefore bacterial exotoxins are most likely responsible for the intraepidermal blistering in our case just as in ssss. bullae are an unfavorable prognostic sign in gram positive  toxic shock syndrome. both tzanck test and frozen-section biopsy are easy to perform and useful in the early and rapid recognition of gram positive bullous toxic shock syndrome.

TI  == a multinational european survey on the in-vitro activity of rufloxacin and other  comparative antibiotics on respiratory and urinary bacterial pathogens.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of rufloxacin was confirmed against a large number of  respiratory and urinary tract pathogens collected in five european countries. in  terms of both mic90 values and percentages of susceptible isolates found, this new quinolone showed useful in-vitro activity against mycoplasma catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae and klebsiella pneumoniae, with a large proportion of staphylococcus aureus also covered, while, as expected streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes were not included in its antibacterial spectrum. rufloxacin was comparable with the other antibiotics against these pathogens with the exception of streptococci. against these microorganisms, beta-lactams were the most active agents. against the urinary pathogens the in-vitro activity of rufloxacin is similar to that of norfloxacin although this latter drug is more active in terms of mic90 values and in percentages of strains inhibited. in many  cases more isolates were susceptible to the remaining comparator agents than to rufloxacin. however, there were no significant differences between the numbers of microorganisms inhibited by the various drugs and rufloxacin. the findings of this survey do not seem to modify the general picture which emerged in previous studies and further confirms its useful spectrum in different geographic settings.

TI  == fibronectin-binding protein of streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus.
AB  == by screening a genomic lambda library of streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus, we have cloned and sequenced a gene, termed fnz, encoding a fibronectin (fn)-binding protein called fnz. on the basis of the deduced amino acid sequence  of fnz, the mature protein has a molecular mass of approximately 61 kda. analysis of fnz reveals a structural organization similar to that of other cell surface proteins from streptococci and staphylococci. the fn-binding activity is localized to two domains in the c-terminal part of fnz. one domain is composed of five repeats, which contain a motif similar to what has earlier been found in other fn-binding proteins in streptococci and staphylococci. the first and second repeats are separated by a short stretch of amino acids, including the motif lagesget, which is an important part of the second fn-binding domain. this motif  is also present in an fn-binding domain (ur) in protein f of streptococcus pyogenes. a fusion protein covering the fn-binding domain of fnz inhibits the binding of the 29-kda n-terminal fragment of fn to cells of various streptococcal species as well as to staphylococcus aureus.

AB  == bacterial complications of varicella in 84 patients younger than 16 years of age  (48 females; median age, 2.9 years) who required hospitalization between 1985 and 1995 were retrospectively analyzed. the purpose of the study was to describe demographics, clinical manifestations, bacteriology, and factors affecting outcome. seventy-six percent of patients were younger than 5 years of age. the eldest children in households were significantly underrepresented (p = .00025). skin infections occurred in 61 patients (73%), and deep-seated infections and/or  shock occurred in 23 (27%). the latter complications were significantly associated with thrombocytopenia (p = .011) and bacteremia (p = .014) at the time of admission, prolonged fever (p = .001), prolonged hospitalization (p < .0001),  intensive care management (p < .0001), and fatal outcome (p = .019). group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus (59% of isolates) and staphylococcus aureus (28%) were the predominant isolates. before and after 1990, five (31%) of 16 and 13 (62%) of 21 streptococcal complications, respectively, were invasive infections (p = .09). these data underscore the need for universal immunization against chickenpox.

TI  == [erysipelas and impetigo].
AB  == erysipela is a dermal or hypodermal infection of the skin, which predominantly involves the leg and is associated with high fever. erysipela is most often caused by streptococcus pyogenes. venous insufficiency or lymphoedema are important local factors for the development of this infection which spreads from  intertrigo, local wound or leg ulcer. treatment is essentially based on parenteral penicillin g. impetigo is a superficial infection of the skin due to staphylococcus aureus or to streptococcus pyogenes, and is frequent in children.  classical impetigo is made of yellow-brown crusts located around the mouth and nose, whereas bullous impetigo involves frequently the trunk and limbs. secondary impetigo occurring in pediculosis or scabiosis is frequent. it is a contagious disease which is more frequent in patients with poor hygiene. it can be treated by general antibiotics, mainly macrolides, penicillin m or cephalosporins.

TI  == semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotics derived from ly264826 active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  == certain derivatives of the glycopeptide antibiotic ly264826 with n-alkyl-linked substitutions on the epivancosamine sugar are active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci. six compounds representing our most active series were evaluated for activity against antibiotic-resistant, gram-positive pathogens. for enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis resistant to both vancomycin  and teicoplanin, the mics of the six semisynthetic compounds for 90% of the strains tested were 1 to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 2,048 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 256 micrograms/ml for ly264826. for e. faecium and e. faecalis resistant to vancomycin but not teicoplanin, the mics were 0.016 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 64 to 1,024 micrograms/ml for vancomycin. the compounds were highly active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and against e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus and showed some activity against isolates of highly vancomycin-resistant leuconostocs and pediococci. the mics for 90% of the strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus tested were typically 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 microgram/ml for vancomycin. against methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis mics ranged from 0.25 to 2 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 to 4 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 4 to 16 micrograms/ml for teicoplanin. the spectrum of these new compounds included activity against teicoplanin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci. the compounds exhibited exceptional potency against pathogenic streptococci, with mics of < or = 0.008 microgram/ml against streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant isolates. in in vivo studies with a mouse infection model, the median effective doses against a challenge by s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, or s. pyogenes were typically 4 to 20 times lower than those of vancomycin. overall, these new glycopeptides, such as ly307599 and ly333328, show promise for use as agents against resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci.

TI  == comparative antimicrobial activity and post-antibiotic effect of azithromycin, clarithromycin and roxithromycin against some respiratory pathogens.
AB  == recent macrolide derivatives, roxithromycin, azithromycin and clarithromycin show more favourable pharmacokinetic characteristics in comparison to old ones and some differences in antibacterial activity. with the aim of improving our understanding of some aspects of their action against respiratory pathogens, we determined the mics and mbcs of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae. azithromycin was the most active agent against haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, while clarithromycin was more active against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus with mics similar to those of erythromycin. the bactericidal activity of all tested derivatives was weak against staphylococcus aureus (mbc/mic ratio approximately 16) and against moraxella catarrhalis (mbc/mic ratio, 8-16), but good against staphylococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae (mbc/mic ratio, 2-4). the determination of killing curves in the presence of 2 mic and 10 mic of  azithromycin, clarithromycin and roxithromycin confirmed their weak bactericidal  activity against staphylococcus aureus and moraxella catarrhalis as well as their effective activity against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. azithromycin showed the highest bactericidal activity against haemophilus influenzae. as expected, the three derivatives produced a quite prolonged pae when exposed to 5 mic for 1 h, ranging between 2-4 h. the bactericidal activity and the prolonged pae of new macrolides for the most common respiratory pathogens should assure a good clinical activity in respiratory infections including those  sustained by haemophilus influenzae, which is less susceptible to erythromycin and other old macrolides.

AB  == purpose: the purpose of the investigation was to determine the effect of tablet excipients on the activity of cetylpyridinium chloride (cpc) and the relative interaction between excipients and cpc. methods: an analytical assay was developed to evaluate the interaction between cpc and the excipients. in vivo activity was investigated using six volunteers by determining the reduction in colony forming units recoverable from the oropharynx after sucking each proprietary lozenge separately on different days. in vitro determinations investigated the relative antimicrobial activity of aqueous solutions of the lozenges and, the effect of ph and tablet base excipients on that activity against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and candida albicans. results: both in vivo and in vitro results showed that the tablet based lozenges  had markedly reduced antimicrobial activities compared with previous results with a candy based lozenge (in vivo and in vitro) or the same concentration of aqueous cpc (in vitro). magnesium stearate suspensions in cpc 250 micrograms/ml indicated that magnesium stearate adsorbed cpc and at 0.4% lozenge weight and above significantly reduced the antimicrobial activity of cpc 250 micrograms/ml. conclusions: the reduced activity of cpc in tablet based lozenges resulted from a decreased availability of cpc in solution due to an adsorption of cpc on magnesium stearate. to avoid this reduction in activity tablet based lozenges containing cpc 250 micrograms/ml, or similar concentrations, plus magnesium stearate should contain not more than 0.3% w/w lozenge weight of the lubricant.

TI  == survival of potentially pathogenic human-associated bacteria in the rhizosphere of hydroponically grown wheat.
AB  == plants may serve as reservoirs for human-associated bacteria (h-ab) in long-term  space missions containing bioregenerative life support systems. the current study examined the abilities of five human-associated potential pathogens, pseudomonas  aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and escherichia coli, to colonize and grow in the rhizosphere of hydroponically grown wheat, a candidate crop for life support. all of these bacteria have been recovered from past nasa missions and present potential problems for future missions. the abilities of these organisms to adhere to the roots of axenic five-day-old wheat (triticum aestivum l. cv. yecora rojo) were evaluated by enumeration of the attached organisms after a one hour incubation of roots in a suspension (approximately 10(8) cfu ml-1) of the h-ab. results showed that a greater percentage of p. aeruginosa cells adhered to the wheat roots than the other four h-ab. similarly incubated seedlings were also grown under attempted axenic conditions for seven days to examine the potential of each organism to proliferate in the rhizosphere (root colonization capacity). p. cepacia and p. aerogiunosa showed considerable growth, e. coli and s. aureus showed no significant growth, and s. pyogenes died off in the wheat rhizosphere. studies examining the effects of competition on the survival of these microorganisms indicated that p. aeruginosa was the only organism that survived in the rhizosphere of hydroponically grown wheat in the presence of different levels of  microbial competition.

TI  == assembly of human contact phase proteins and release of bradykinin at the surface of curli-expressing escherichia coli.
AB  == previous work has demonstrated that most strains of the human pathogen streptococcus pyogenes bind kininogens through m protein, a fibrous surface protein and virulence determinant. here we find that strains of several other pathogenic bacterial species, both gram-positive and gram-negative, isolated from patients with sepsis, also bind kininogens, especially kininogen (hk). the most pronounced interaction was seen between hk and escherichia coli. among clinical isolates of e. coli, the majority of the enterohaemorrhagic, enterotoxigenic, and sepsis strains, but none of the enteroinvasive and enteropathogenic strains, bound hk. binding of hk to e. coli correlated with the expression of curli, another fibrous bacterial surface protein, and the binding of hk to purified curli was specific, saturable, and of high affinity; ka = 9 x 10(7) m-1. other contact phase proteins such as factor xi, factor xii, and prekallikrein bound to  curliated e. coli, but not to an isogenic curli-deficient mutant strain, suggesting that contact phase activation may occur at the surface of curliated bacteria. kininogens are also precursor molecules of the vasoactive kinins. when  incubated with human plasma, curli-expressing bacteria absorbed hk. addition of purified plasma kallikrein to the hk-loaded bacteria resulted in a rapid and efficient release of bradykinin from surface-bound hk. the assembly of contact phase factors at the surface of pathogenic bacteria and the release of the potent proinflammatory and vasoactive peptide bradykinin, should have a major impact on  the host-microbe relationship and may contribute to bacterial pathogenicity and virulence.

AB  == chronic sinusitis is one of the most common diseases treated in outpatient centres. in this prospective study, 49 patients with the diagnosis of chronic maxillary sinusitis were evaluated microbiologically by using sinus swab, irrigation fluid and sinus mucosal tissue specimens obtained during endoscopic sinus surgery. there was no bacterial growth in seven cases. in the remaining 42  cases a total of 89 bacteria were isolated, 28 of them being classical pathogens  and 61 being non-classical pathogens. among the classical pathogens staphylococcus aureus was the most common one. the correlation between the isolates obtained from maxillary sinus and isolates obtained from throat, nose and nasopharynx did not have a predictive value. since the overall rate of classical pathogen isolation from patients with chronic sinusitis was not significantly high, the possible role of factors other than bacterial growth should be identified in the pathogenesis of chronic sinusitis.

TI  == in vitro activities of u-100592 and u-100766, novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agents.
AB  == oxazolidinones make up a relatively new class of antimicrobial agents which possess a unique mechanism of bacterial protein synthesis inhibition. u-100592 (s)-n-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-[4-(hydroxyacetyl)-1-piperazinyl]- phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide and u-100766 (s)-n-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-(4-morpholinyl)phenyl]- 2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide are novel oxazolidinone analogs from a directed chemical modification program. mics were determined for a variety of bacterial clinical isolates; the respective mics of u-100592 and u-100766 at which 90% of isolates are inhibited were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant s. aureus, 4  and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 and 2  micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; enterococcus faecalis, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; enterococcus faecium, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; streptococcus pyogenes, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.50 and 1 microgram/ml; corynebacterium spp., 0.50 and 0.50 micrograms/ml; moraxella catarrhalis, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; listeria monocytogenes, 8 and 2 micrograms/ml; and bacteroides fragilis, 16 and 4 micrograms/ml. most strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis and the gram-positive anaerobes were inhibited in the range of 0.50 to 2 micrograms/ml. enterococcal strains resistant to vancomycin (vana, vanb, and vanc resistance phenotypes), pneumococcal strains resistant to penicillin, and m. tuberculosis strains resistant to common antitubercular agents (isoniazid, streptomycin, rifampin, ethionamide, and ethambutol) were not cross-resistant to the oxazolidinones. the  presence of 10, 20, and 40% pooled human serum did not affect the antibacterial activities of the oxazolidinones. time-kill studies demonstrated a bacteriostatic effect of the analogs against staphylococci and enterococci but a bactericidal effect against streptococci. the spontaneous mutation frequencies of s. aureus atcc 29213 were <3.8 x 10(-10) and <8 x 10(-11) for u-100592 and u-100766, respectively. serial transfer of three staphylococcal and two enterococcal strains on drug gradient plates produced no evidence of rapid resistance development. thus, these new oxazolidinone analogs demonstrated in vitro antibacterial activities against a variety of clinically important human pathogens.

TI  == [efficacy of cefditoren pivoxil in the treatment of acute otitis media due to benzylpenicillin-insensitive streptococcus pneumoniae].
AB  == clinical and bacteriological studies were carried out on cefditoren pivoxil (cdtr-pi) granule in infantile purulent acute otitis media treated at general practice settings and the following findings were obtained: 1. two hundred forty  eight strains were isolated from 210 patients, almost all of which (81.1%) harbored the following two strains: streptococcus pneumoniae (42.3%) and haemophilus influenzae (38.8%). among s. pneumoniae, benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae, (pisp) or pcg-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) was 36.2%, corresponding to 15.3% of all the isolates and found in 18% of all patients. 2. the bacteria in the middle ear discharge and the nasopharyngeal swabs were correlated with conformity rate of more than 80% with regard to streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae but no staphylococcus aureus was detected simultaneously from the two sources in any of the patients. s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) were considered to be contaminants that were originated from the external auditory meatus at the time of sampling. 3. frequencies of isolation of s. pneumoniae from different age groups were higher in a lower age group between 0 and 4 years and those of pisp or prsp had the similar tendency. 4. antibacterial activities were determined for cdtr and related oral antibiotics against the strains of s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae as representative isolates. cdtr had stronger antibacterial activities against both bacteria than the reference antibiotics. cdtr was found to be transferred into the otorrhea at a mean concentration of 0.58 micrograms/ml after single administration of cdtr-pi granule formulation at 3 mg(potency)/kg. 5. as for bacterial eradication efficacies in the middle ear cavity and the nasopharynx, eradication rates were higher than 80% in the middle ear cavity in all cases without large differences among bacterial species but eradication rate  of pisp was 30% in the nasopharynx, and it was significantly lower than those of  pssp and other bacteria. 6. in view of clinical effectiveness, the efficacy rate  was 89.4% and bacteriological effects was 92.2%; in view of safety, adverse reactions were; observed in 9.5% and the rate of usefulness was 89.4%. 7. from above-stated results, cdtr-pi was considered as a useful oral antibiotic for infantile acute otitis media including pisp infections.

AB  == eighty percent minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic80) of sulopenem against clinically isolated 12 to 80 strains of each of different bacteria were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa): 0.20 micrograms/ml, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa): 50 micrograms/ml, coagulase-negative staphylococci: 3.13 micrograms/ml, streptococcus pyogenes: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, streptococcus pneumoniae: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, beta-streptococci: 0.05 microgram/ml, enterococcus faecalis: 12.5 micrograms/ml,  enterococcus faecium: > 100 micrograms/ml, escherichia coli cs2(r+): 0.10 microgram/ml, klebsiella pneumoniae: 0.05 microgram/ml, proteus mirabilis: 0.10 microgram/ml, proteus vulgaris: 0.20 microgram/ml, morganella morganii: 0.39 micrograms/ml, providencia rettgeri: 3.13 micrograms/ml, citrobacter freundii: 0.20 microgram/ml, enterobacter cloacae: 0.39 microgram/ml, serratia marcescens:  1.56 micrograms/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50 micrograms/ml, pseudomonas cepacia: 3.13 micrograms/ml, xanthomonas maltophilia: > 100 micrograms/ml, acinetobacter calcoaceticus: 1.56 micrograms/ml, ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae: 0.39 microgram/ml and bacteroides fragil is: 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. sulopenem possesses a stronger activity than flomoxef or cefuzonam  against gram-positive bacteria, the strongest activity among the antibiotics tested against gram-negative bacteria except p. aeruginosa. sulopenem has stronger affinities than imipenem to all fractions of pbps of s. aureus, e. coli, p. vulgaris, s. marcescens, even of p. aeruginosa. affinities of sulopenem to pbps-1 and -3 of s. aureus, pbp-2 of e. coli were much stronger than those of imipenem (ipm). sulopenem generally has small ki values to all types of beta-lactamases and also has stronger permanent inactivation effect to ia and iib types of beta-lactamases than ipm. no synergistic bactericidal activity of sulopenem was apparent with serum complement. however, synergism of sulopenem with macrophages was prominent in bactericidal activity. the cells of e. coli were well phagocytosed and rapidly digested by cultured macrophages in the presence of a higher than 1/8 mic of sulopenem. moreover, sulopenem was more stable than imipenem against swine and human dehydropeptidase-is. sulopenem is one of the antibiotics that do not induce the appearance of subclones resistant to the drug.

TI  == [in vitro and in vivo activities of sulopenem compared with those of imipenem and cephalosporins].
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem (cp-70,429),a new  parenteral penem antibiotic, were compared with those of imipenem (ipm), flomoxef, cefuzonam (czon) and cefotaxime. sulopenem possessed broad-spectrum activities against gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria. antibacterial activities of sulopenem against methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were equivalent to or somewhat superior to those of ipm. against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, sulopenem was 4- to 260-fold more active than reference antibiotics with broad-spectra. in a killing kinetics study for haemophilus influenzae, sulopenem showed a 99.9% decrease of viable cells after 8 hours at a  concentration of 0.20 micrograms/ml. this effect was obtained at a concentration  8-fold lower than that of ipm. the protective effects of sulopenem in murine experimental systemic infections were superior to those of imipenem/cilastatin. in murine experimental mixed infection with escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis, sulopenem had lower ed50, in other words stronger antimicrobial activities than ipm. the therapeutic effect of sulopenem are related well with its mic value. in guinea pigs experimental lung infection with klebsiella pneumoniae, sulopenem was more effective than czon or cefotiam.

TI  == bacterial superantigen-induced human lymphocyte responses are nitric oxide dependent and mediated by il-12 and ifn-gamma.
AB  == bacterial superantigens cause marked proliferation of t cells and release of lymphokines. nitric oxide, derived from the conversion of l-arginine to l-citrulline, inhibits this activation in murine cells. we have now investigated  the roles of il-12, ifn-gamma, lymphotoxin-alpha, and nitric oxide during superantigen-induced human lymphocyte activation. lymphocyte activation was determined by measurement of proliferative responses and lymphokine release. both toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 from staphylococcus aureus and recombinant streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin a induced proliferation and production of ifn-gamma, lymphotoxin-alpha, and il-12 by human mononuclear cells in a time-dependent fashion. the release of ifn-gamma was abrogated by a neutralizing  ab to il-12, but lymphocyte proliferative responses were unaffected. a neutralizing ab to ifn-gamma prevented the release of lymphotoxin-alpha, but did  not affect proliferation. the neutralization of lymphotoxin-alpha using two different abs did not affect ifn-gamma release or proliferation. in contrast to previous findings in mice, the arginine analogue, ng-monomethyl-l-arginine, significantly inhibited both proliferation and lymphokine release by superantigen-stimulated human cells. thus, the release of lymphotoxin-alpha by lymphocytes following superantigen stimulation is dependent upon the presence of  ifn-gamma; the ifn-gamma response is in turn under the control of il-12. there is no evidence that nitric oxide plays an inhibitory role during superantigen-mediated human lymphocyte activation. indeed, arginine is a prerequisite for such activation.

TI  == polymerase chain reaction of bacterial genomes with single universal primer: application to distinguishing mycobacteria species.
AB  == the polymerase chain reaction with a single universal primer (up-pcr) was applied to bacterial strains and mycobacteria isolates alongside conventional methods. a  universal protocol of preparation of pcr samples from cultures representing escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, mycobacterium tuberculosis, mycobacterium bovis, and several non-tuberculous mycobacteria was found to be reproducible and efficient with these organisms. the bands of up-pcr  products observed in an agarose gel after electrophoresis were species-specific and provided an efficient means of distinguishing bacterial species. the applicability of this approach to mycobacteria identification was assessed by comparing the dna bands obtained for different strains. three reference strains and 22 clinical isolates of m. tuberculosis and m. bovis produced very similar dna banding patterns. they comprised a triplet of prominent and several minor fragments within the 200-500 base pair (bp) size range and were the easiest to interpret. the dna profiles of unrelated mycobacteria clearly differed from each  other when subjected to electrophoretic analysis and correlated well with results of culture method. the method provides a real promise of its application in clinical studies as a simple assay for distinguishing between tubercle bacilli.

TI  == glycerol and ichthammol: medicinal solution or mythical potion?
AB  == glycerol and ichthammol (g & i) has been used for generations by otologists. however, there is a paucity of information on both its mode of action and its anti-bacterial properties. the aim of this paper was to ascertain firstly, what the most common organisms found in discharging ears were and secondly, what antibacterial activity g & i had against these organisms. all ear swabs from 1992-1994 in our unit were reviewed to ascertain the prevalence of the commonly isolated organisms. fresh isolates of these organisms were collected and plated onto agar with wells of glycerol, ichthammol and a combination of both as used in clinical practice. the diameters of the zones of inhibition observed after incubation were measured in millimetres. common isolates were: pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabalis, streptococcus pyogenes in descending order of frequency. pure glycerol showed no significant zones of inhibition against any of the organisms tested. the average zones of inhibition for g & i and ichthammol alone were for staphylococcus aureus 15 mm and 18 mm and for streptococcus pyogenes: 16 mm and 23 mm. ichthammol alone was significantly more effective than g & i (p < 0.001). there was no significant activity against  proteus mirabalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the therapeutic benefit of g & i is due in part to the inherent anti-bacterial activity of ichthammol against the gram positive organisms as well as its anti-inflammatory action and the dehydrating effect of the glycerol.

TI  == phylogenetic distribution of streptococcal superantigen ssa allelic variants provides evidence for horizontal transfer of ssa within streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == phylogenetic analyses recently found the gene encoding the streptococcal superantigen ssa of streptococcus pyogenes to occur in several well-differentiated clones comprising 10 (12.5%) of 80 clonal lineages examined.  to determine if distinct clonal lineages carried the same ssa coding sequence or  harbored a group of allelic variants, ssa was sequenced from 23 s. pyogenes strains representing the 10 clones identified by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. three alleles of ssa were found in natural populations of s. pyogenes. ssa-1 and ssa-3 differed by a single synonymous substitution in codon 94; both encoded ssa-1. each of these alleles was present in phylogenetically diverse clones that had not shared a recent common ancestor. ssa-2 was present in a single clonal lineage. it was identical to ssa-3 at codon 94 but had a nonsynonymous substitution at codon 28 that changed the second amino acid of the  mature protein from serine to arginine. this substitution altered the predicted isoelectric point and affected the apparent molecular mass during sodium dodecyl  sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. despite sequence variation both upstream of and within the ssa locus, all ssa-positive lineages expressed either  ssa-1 or ssa-2. the observed patterns of ssa allele-clone distribution provide evidence for individual incidences of horizontal transfer and recombination of ssa among distinct group a streptococcal lineages. although the extensive homology of ssa to the staphylococcal superantigen seb raises the possibility of  intergeneric gene transfer, a search for ssa in 68 genetically diverse clones of  staphylococcus aureus did not identify the gene. moreover, the absence of ssa among 119 representative strains of lancefield group b, c, or g streptococci suggests that ssa is confined to s. pyogenes.

AB  == studies on circulating t cells and antibodies in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetic  patients and rodent models of autoimmune diabetes suggest that beta-cell membrane proteins of 38 kda may be important molecular targets of autoimmune attack. biochemical approaches to the isolation and identification of the 38-kda autoantigen have been hampered by the restricted availability of islet tissue and the low abundance of the protein. a procedure of epitope analysis for cd4+ t cells using subtracted expression libraries (teasel) was developed and used to clone a 70-amino acid pancreatic beta-cell peptide incorporating an epitope recognized by a 38-kda-reactive cd4+ t-cell clone (1c6) isolated from a human diabetic patient. the minimal epitope was mapped to a 10-amino acid synthetic peptide containing a dr1 consensus binding motif. data base searches did not reveal the identity of the protein, though a weak homology to the bacterial superantigens sea (streptococcus pyogenes exotoxin a) and seb (staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin b) (23% identity) was evident. the teasel procedure might be used to identify epitopes of other autoantigens recognized by cd4+ t cells in diabetes as well as be more generally applicable to the study low-abundance autoantigens in other tissue-specific autoimmune diseases.

AB  == a multicentre open-label, randomised trial was performed to compare the efficacy  and safety of cefpodoxime proxetil bd and cefaclor tds in the treatment of acute  otitis media in children. a total of 167 children aged from 1 month to 11 years were enrolled in five centres: 78 treated with cefpodoxime and 83 treated with cefaclor, were evaluated in the itt analysis. after tympanocentesis and culture of middle ear fluid, a pathogen was isolated from 85 (53%) of the 161 evaluable patients for the itt analysis. the organisms isolated were as follows: streptococcus pneumoniae: (n = 33, 37.5%); haemophilus influenzae: (n = 22, 25%); staphylococcus aureus: (n = 15, 17.1%); streptococcus pyogenes: (n = 8, 9.1%); moraxella catarrhalis: (n = 2, 2.3%); others (n = 6, 6.8%). success (defined as a satisfactory clinical outcome, either cure or improvement) was achieved at the end of treatment, in 93.6% of ther patients in the cefpodoxime group and 91.6% of the patients in the cefaclor group (p> 0.05). clinical recurrence was identified  at the follow-up visit (30 days after inclusion), in 6.4% of the cefpodoxime-treated patients and 7.2% of the cefaclor-treated patients (p> 0.05). the drugs were well tolerated by 78/79 (99%) of patients in the cefpodoxime-treated group and 80/85 (94%) in the cefaclor-treated group. the incidence of adverse effects was higher in the cefaclor group than in the cefpodoxime group, but this was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). in conclusion, cefpodaxime proxetil administered bd is as effective as cefaclor administered tds in the treatment of acute otitis media in children. the less frequent dosing schedule of cefpodoxime (bd) compared with cefaclor (tds) appears to be more convenient for the treatment of the infections in children.

TI  == inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-p), has been documented for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus bovis, and lactococcus lactis, but not for other gram-positive bacteria. using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated atp-dependent hpr(ser) kinase that phosphorylates ser-46 in hpr of the phosphotransferase system. a small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-p phosphatase (pase  ii), previously identified only in lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, or bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. further, lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks pase ii. the results reveal that pase ii is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-p hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. they provide correlative evidence that pase ii initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.

AB  == a panel of 15 mouse t-cell hybridomas, each expressing a different human vbeta gene segment (hvbeta) in an otherwise mouse t-cell receptor (i.e., mouse alpha chain and cd3 complex), was constructed by transfection of hvbeta/mouse cbeta chimeric t-cell receptor (tcr)-beta genes into a mouse t-cell hybridoma recipient lacking the endogenous tcr-beta chain. several qualities that are conferred by the hvbeta chain of the tcr are retained in the chimeric human-mouse tcr complex: a large panel of hvbeta-specific antibodies specifically stained the hvbeta expressed by the mouse t-cell hybridomas. moreover, hvbeta-transfected mouse cells could readily produce interleukin 2 when stimulated by superantigens presented by antigen-presenting cells. these characteristics made it possible to  refine the reactivity of 17 superantigen preparations with the available transfected vbetas. each superantigen gave a characteristic pattern of reactivity on the transfectants. positive reactivities with some of these transfectants, which differ only by the expressed hvbeta, demonstrate unambiguously the superantigenic character of a protein or fraction and its potential to react with the corresponding vbetas. therefore, these hvbeta-transfected cells constituted a valuable tool for determining "specificity fingerprints" of known or putative superantigens. first, commonly used, commercially available superantigens such as staphylococcal enterotoxin b and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (tsst-1) showed additional vbeta reactivities, compared with those of their recombinant counterparts. this stresses the importance of using defined preparations of superantigens for the definition of vbeta specificities. second, the stimulatory  pattern of a strain of streptococcus pyogenes demonstrated that this strain, unlike others, produces a potent vbeta 8-specific superantigen that is an yet undefined at the molecular level.

TI  == food safety: review and implications for dietitians and dietetic technicians.
AB  == section 103 (d) of the americans with disabilities act directs the secretary of health and human services to identify, publish, and annually review a list of pathogens transmitted via food contaminated by infected food handlers. the secretary is also directed to publish means by which diseases on the list are transmitted. the intent of the list is to protect disabled food handlers when they become ill and to provide managers with information for determining when to  remove or reassign disabled food handlers who have infectious or communicable diseases to jobs that do not involve handling food. pathogens often transmitted via food contaminated by infected food handlers are salmonella typhi, shigella species, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, hepatitis a virus, and the norwalk and norwalk-like viruses. this article discusses section 103 (d) and  for each of the six pathogens describes characteristics and growth requirements,  types of foods involved in outbreaks, factors that contribute to foodborne outbreaks, and prevention and control measures. human beings are the only reservoir of sal typhi. the source of shigella species is the intestinal tract of human beings and other primates. human beings are the common reservoir of staph aureus and strep pyogenes. staph aureus is frequently found in the nose and on the skin of healthy people, whereas strep pyogenes is carried in the throat of infected or asymptomatic carriers. foodborne viruses of public health concern originate in the human intestine. foods that favor the multiplication of sal typhi are often foods that require no cooking. many outbreaks of foodborne disease attributed to shigella species and viruses have been associated with salads. moist, high-protein, and salty foods that have been cooked are most often involved in outbreaks of staphylococcal foodborne illness. foods usually implicated in strep pyogenes outbreaks are predominately composed of milk, eggs,  or meat. dietitians and dietetic technicians can use three approaches to reduce the incidence of foodborne disease attributed to food handlers: conducting training and education programs, implementing a hazard analysis and critical control points system, and supporting certification of foodservice managers.

AB  == bacterial adherence to host tissue involves specific microbial surface adhesins of which a subfamily termed microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (mscramms) specifically recognize extracellular matrix components. we now report on the biophysical characterization of recombinant fibronectin binding mscramms originating from several different species of gram-positive bacteria. the far-uv cd spectra (190-250 nm) of recombinant forms of the ligand binding domain of the mscramms, in a phosphate-buffered saline solution at neutral ph, were characteristic of a protein containing little or no  regular secondary structure. the intrinsic viscosity of this domain was found to  be the same in the presence or absence of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, indicating that the native and denatured conformations are indistinguishable. on addition of fibronectin nh2 terminus as ligand to the recombinant adhesin there is a large change in the resulting far-uv cd difference spectra. at a 4.9 m excess of the nh2 terminus the difference spectra shifted to what was predominately a beta-sheet conformation, as judged by comparison with model far-uv cd spectra. the fibronectin nh2-terminal domain undergoes a minute but reproducible blue-shift of its intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence on addition of rfnbd-a, which contains no tryptophan residues. since this result indicates that there is no large change in the environment of the tryptophan residues of the nh2 terminus on binding, the large shift in secondary structure observed by cd analysis is attributed to induction of a predominately beta-sheet secondary structure in the  adhesin on binding to fibronectin nh2 terminus.

TI  == a monoclonal antibody enhances ligand binding of fibronectin mscramm (adhesin) from streptococcus dysgalactiae.
AB  == a monoclonal antibody 3a10, generated from a mouse immunized with the streptococcus dysgalactiae fibronectin (fn) binding protein fnba, was isolated, and its effect on ligand binding by the antigen was examined. the epitope for 3a10 was localized to a previously unidentified fn binding motif (designated an)  just n-terminal of the repeat domain which represents the primary ligand binding  site on fnba. fn binding to au was enhanced by 3a10 rather than inhibited. this effect was demonstrated in two different assays. first, in the presence of 3a10 the au-containing proteins and synthetic peptide more effectively competed with bacterial cells for binding to fn. second, 3a10 dramatically increased the binding of biotin-labeled forms of the au-containing proteins to fn immobilized on a blotting membrane. pure 3a10 igg did not recognize the antigen by itself, and fn was required for the immunological interaction between the antibody and the epitope. this induction effect of fn was shown in both western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in which immobilized au-containing molecules were probed with 3a10 in the presence of varying concentrations of fn. specificity analyses of 3a10 revealed that the monoclonal also recognized a ligand binding motif in a streptococcus pyogenes fn binding mscramm but not the corresponding motifs in two related adhesins from staphylococcus aureus and s. dysgalactiae. furthermore, 3a10 stimulated fn binding by s. pyogenes cells. these results together with subsequent biophysical studies presented in the accompanying paper (house-pomepeo, k., xu, y., joh, d., speziale, p., and hook, m. (1996) j. biol. chem. 271, 1379-1384) indicate that the ligand binding sites of fn binding mscramms have little or no secondary structure. however, on binding to fn, they appear to undergo a structural rearrangement resulting in a defined structure rich in beta sheet and expressing a ligand-induced binding site for antibodies such as 3a10.

TI  == systemic immune response to streptococcal and staphylococcal lipoteichoic acids in children with recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  == the antibodies to lta of streptococcus pyogenes (s. pyogenes) and of staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) in sera from 110 children with or without recurrent tonsillitis were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa).  the antibody of iga class was not detected in any sera. there was a significant positive correlation between igg and igm antibody levels to lta of s. pyogenes and those to lta of s. aureus. there was no significant correlation between anti-lta igm antibody and age or episodes of tonsillitis. however, serum anti-lta igg levels in younger patients ( < or = 7 y.o.) were significantly lower than those in their elders (>7 y.o.) (anti-s. pyogenes; p = 0.0007, anti-s. aureus; p  = 0.007). serum anti-lta igg antibody levels correlated inversely with episodes of tonsillitis in younger patients ( < 7 y.o.) (s. pyogenes: r = -0.362, p = 0.0082, s. aureus: r = -0.276, p = 0.047). these findings suggest that systemic hyposensitivity to lta of s. pyogenes and s. aureus may be a possible cause of habitualness of tonsillitis in young children.

TI  == molecular population genetic analysis of emerged bacterial pathogens: selected insights.
AB  == research in bacterial population genetics has increased in the last 10 years. population genetic theory and tools and related strategies have been used to investigate bacterial pathogens that have contributed to recent episodes of temporal variation in disease frequency and severity. a common theme demonstrated by these analyses is that distinct bacterial clones are responsible for disease outbreaks and increases in infection frequency. many of these clones are characterized by unique combinations of virulence genes or alleles of virulence genes. because substantial interclonal variance exists in relative virulence, molecular population genetic studies have led to the concept that the unit of bacterial pathogenicity is the clone or cell line. continued new insights into host parasite interactions at the molecular level will be achieved by combining clonal analysis of bacterial pathogens with large-scale comparative sequencing of virulence genes.

TI  == the nasopharyngeal bacterial flora in children with otitis media with effusion.
AB  == a study was undertaken to evaluate the incidence of nasopharyngeal alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against pathogens, as a defense mechanism of the normal bacterial flora against infection. cultures were taken from the nasopharynges of 43 children with otitis media with effusion (ome). the  detection rates of alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococus aureus and group  a streptococci were significantly lower in the nasopharynx than those isolated from the tonsils of the same patients. moreover, the detection rates of alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against all of these pathogens derived from the nasopharynx were lower than those in healthy children, streptococcal strains with activity against h. influenzae and strep, pneumoniae were also lower than that in patients with tonsillitis. these findings suggest that low nasopharyngeal levels of alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against respiratory pathogens may render children susceptible to ome. further studies are needed to investigate the relationships between the prevalence of pathogens in the nasopharynx and the inhibitory activities of alpha-streptococci  against them in order to devise and select optimal treatment for patients with ome.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == emerging resistance to antimicrobial agents in gram-positive bacteria. enterococci, staphylococci and nonpneumococcal streptococci.
AB  == staphylococci (staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus species) and enterococci are the aetiological organisms in 47 to 52% of nosocomial blood stream infections and approximately 30% of all nosocomial infections in the us. in european intensive care units, almost half of all infections are attributed to staphylococci. the streptococci have also become increasingly important because of the modified virulence of streptococcus pyogenes strains, and the emerging role of the viridans group streptococci as a cause of potentially fatal bacteraemia in the neutropenic host. resistance to available antimicrobial agents is increasing and includes, in particular, resistance to the glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin) amongst enterococci, resistance to penicillinase-resistant penicillins (oxacillin and methicillin) and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin) amongst staphylococci, and resistance to penicillin and some other beta-lactams amongst viridans group streptococci. new compounds for effective therapy of infection with antimicrobial-resistant gram-positive species are needed urgently. to this end, the streptogramin combinations [quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid)],  everninomycin derivatives (sch 27899), oxazolidinones (u-100572, u-100766) and several newer fluoroquinolones (clinafloxacin, du 6859a, grepafloxacin, levofloxacin, sparfloxacin, trovafloxacin) are under rapid development and clinical investigation.

TI  == etiology of acute otitis media in human immunodeficiency virus-infected children.
AB  == background: acute otitis media (aom) is one of the most common infections that are implicated as significant contributors to morbidity in hiv-infected children. to establish the optimal antibiotic therapy tympanocentesis is indicated as the first line diagnostic procedure, because unusual pathogens may play a role in advanced stages of deficient humoral or cellular immunity. methods: the microbiology of 60 episodes of aom diagnosed in 21 symptomatic hiv-infected children (ages 9 months to 12 years) was compared with that of 121 episodes of aom occurring in 113 immunocompetent hiv-negative children (ages 6 months to 12 years) in the last 5 years. results: the prevalence of the three most common pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus) was similar in hiv-infected and in normal children  (56.5% vs. 54.9% of the ears). staphylococcus aureus was significantly more frequent in aom diagnosed in severely immunosuppressed stages. a significantly lower proportion of middle ear effusions obtained in hiv-infected children yielded no bacteria compared with normal children. beta-lactamase production among isolates of h. influenzae was a rare phenomenon, both in hiv-infected and in normal children. no penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae was found. conclusions: in hiv-infected children with absent or moderate immunosuppression empiric antibiotic therapy should be based on the recommendations given for immunocompetent children of the same geographic area. in severe immunosuppressed  stages, given the possible role of staph. aureus, extended spectrum antibiotics should be considered.

TI  == antibacterial and immunostimulating casein-derived substances from milk: casecidin, isracidin peptides.
AB  == apart from immunoglobulin a and g antibodies and plasma cells, milk also contains antibiotic/host protective peptides that are of value not only for maintenance of its nutritional integrity but also for protection of the newborn and, possibly, protection of the lactating mother. among the first such peptides identified with casecidin; following chymosin digestion of casein at ph 6 or 7, casecidin inhibited in vitro staphylococci, sarcina, bacillus subtilis, diplococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. inhibition occurred at high concentrations, in vitro, compared with commercial antibiotics, and thus interest in casecidin languished. work with casecidin was followed by investigation of a related refined non-immunogenic product of chymosin digestion of alpha s1-casein. this product consisted of the n -terminal segment (1-23) of alpha s1-casein b, named "isracidin", and was significantly effective in vivo at concentrations that were competitive with known antibiotics, as seen in the protection of mice against lethal infection by staphylococcus aureus strain smith. field trials showed that injection of isracidin into the udder gave protection against mastitis in sheep and cows. isracidin was both therapeutic and prophylactic and responses to its therapeutic effect produced long-term immune resistance. isracidin protected mice against candida albicans, by stimulation of both phagocytosis and immune responses. however, like other recently described milk-derived peptides, despite its clinical value, isracidin was overlooked because of the lack of commercial interest in the 1970s and early 1980s, in host-mediated non-specific resistance as a therapeutic approach to infection. another problem that impeded commercial interest was the isomeric variation in isracidin peptides seen on a large-scale batch production for commercial use. it  is hoped that this review of previous studies of the activity of isracidin action will revive interest in milk as an antibiotic source.

TI  == the potential role of bacterial superantigens in the pathogenesis of kawasaki syndrome.
AB  == kawasaki syndrome is an acute multisystem vasculitis of infancy and early childhood associated with high fever, mucocutaneous inflammation, and the development of coronary artery abnormalities. despite the widely held belief that kawasaki syndrome is an infectious disease, investigations have failed to identify a causal organism. previous studies have demonstrated that this illness  is associated with marked activation of monocyte/macrophages and the selective expansion of v beta 2-, less so, of v beta 8.1/8.2-expressing t cells in the peripheral blood from kawasaki syndrome patients during the acute phase of their  illness. these immunologic features are characteristic of diseases that are caused by bacterial toxins which act as superantigens. staphylococcal enterotoxins and streptococcal exotoxins are prototypic superantigens which stimulate large populations of t cells expressing particular t-cell receptor beta-chain variable (v beta) gene segments. using the v beta 2+ t-cell expansion  as an "immunologic footprint" for a superantigen, we have extended these observations to the identification and isolation of a novel clone of toxic shock  syndrome toxin-1-producing staphylococcus aureus in the majority of patients with kawasaki syndrome and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin b/streptococcal pyrogenic  exotoxin c-producing streptococci in a minority of kawasaki syndrome patients. toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin b, and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin c are known to stimulate v beta 2+ t cells. these observations support the hypothesis that the activation of v beta 2+ t cells during the acute phase of kawasaki syndrome is caused by bacterial superantigen(s).

TI  == antibiotics and bacterial resistance. a few elements of genetic basis for this relationship.
AB  == in the preantibiotic era, many people died of bacterial infections caused by such pathogens as staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and mycobacterium tuberculosis. antibiotics have reduced the mortality from infectious diseases but not the prevalence of these diseases. it was not long after the clinical introduction of the first antibiotics in the 1950s that the first reports of bacterial resistance began to appear. use, and often abuse or misuse, of antimicrobial agents has encouraged the evolution of bacteria toward resistance, resulting often in therapeutic failure. in the beginning, new  antibiotics have always appeared in plenty of time to provide new cures for diseases caused by resistant bacterial pathogens. also, some clinically important groups of bacteria showed no signs of major increases in resistance. for example, s. pneumoniae strains remained susceptible to penicillin long after other bacteria had become resistant to it. recent developments of bacteria resistance to antibiotics are indeed disquieting.

TI  == could nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids) enhance the progression of bacterial infections to toxic shock syndrome?
AB  == anecdotal reports suggest an association between the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids) and the progression of invasive group a streptococcal infections to shock and multiorgan failure. there is a biochemical  rationale that could support this theory. though nsaids are frequently used to relieve pain or reduce fever, they also attenuate granulocyte functions such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and bacterial killing. in addition, findings in recent  studies involving human volunteers injected with endotoxin suggest that pretreatment with nsaids enhances production of tumor necrosis factor, which leads to higher blood levels of this cytokine, probably by preventing feedback inhibition by prostaglandin e2. thus, nsaids may contribute to the sudden onset of shock, organ failure, and aggressive infection by inhibiting neutrophil function, augmenting cytokine production, and attenuating the cardinal manifestations of inflammation.

TI  == characterization of superoxide dismutase genes from gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers.
AB  == an internal fragment representing approximately 85% of sod genes from seven gram-positive bacteria was amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase  chain reaction assay. the dna sequences of sod polymerase chain reaction products from clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactococcus lactis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes were determined. comparisons of their deduced amino acid sequences with those of the corresponding regions of  the sod proteins from bacillus stearothermophilus, listeria monocytogenes, and streptococcus mutans revealed strong relatedness. phylogenetic analysis of sod peptides showed that members of the genera streptococcus and those of the genera  enterococcus constitute two well-supported monophyletic groups. the method described in this study provides a means for easy recovery of sod genes and the construction of sod mutants of various gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == protein binding and serum bactericidal activities of vancomycin and teicoplanin.
AB  == in a randomized crossover study, the protein binding and serum bactericidal activities (sbas) of vancomycin and teicoplanin against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes were investigated in six healthy volunteers. total concentrations in serum 1 h postadministration of vancomycin and teicoplanin were 25.5 +/- 2.7 and 10.8 +/- 8.9 mg/liter, respectively; mean free concentrations were 14.6 +/- 2.0 and 0.6 +/- 0.9 mg/liter, respectively. protein binding for vancomycin was 36.9% +/- 2.87%, and that for teicoplanin was 97.4% +/- 2.6%. sba  determined in pooled human serum at 1 h against s. aureus ranged from 1:8 to 1:32 for both vancomycin and teicoplanin. against s. pyogenes sba at 1 h ranged from 1:16 to 1:128 for vancomycin and 1:256 to 1:2,048 for teicoplanin. in vitro kill  curve studies showed that vancomycin is slowly bactericidal and that teicoplanin  is bacteriostatic. despite having less in vitro cidal activity against the study  isolates and having low or unrecordable levels of free drug in serum, teicoplanin demonstrated a similar or better sba than vancomycin. sba was more closely related to the total drug level (r = 0.77 for s. aureus and r = 0.79 for s. pyogenes) than the free level of teicoplanin (r = 0.59 for s. aureus and r = 0.56 for s. pyogenes). the high level of protein binding of teicoplanin did not seem to impair its antibacterial activity as measured by its sba.

TI  == [a new device for the disinfection of handpieces and turbines].
AB  == dental handpieces are often difficult to disinfect. this is one of the main reasons for the considerable risk of cross-infections in dental offices. the aim  of the present study was the evaluation of the disinfectant property of a recent, commercially available, automatic instrument, described as capable to clean, disinfect and lubricate dental handpieces. the following experimental evaluations were made: 1) antimicrobial activity of the disinfectant (glyoxalaldehyde) used.  the method described by the european committee for standardization was followed.  test microorganisms were pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. 2) disinfection of dental handpieces (69 contra-angles and 97 turbines of different  marks). they were naturally infected using them on patients for 30 minutes at least. 3) disinfection of dental handpieces infected with bacterial suspensions of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes (beta-haemolyticus, group a), candida albicans and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the results of the first experiment  showed a strong bactericidal power of the disinfectant with both the tested strains, after a contact time of only 1 minute. a great proportion of the dental  handpieces tested during the second experiment were found disinfected: from 84% through 89% out of the various models of turbine handpieces; from 89% through 100% out of the models of contra-angle handpieces. even though bacterial contamination level was low (about 10(3) microorganisms per handpiece), a satisfactory disinfectant ability in natural conditions was found. the results of the third experiment were unclear. the tested instrument reduced 10(5)-10(8) times the original bacterial count when the gram positive microorganisms (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes) were used. on the other hand, when pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans were used, the results were different: the bacterial count was reduced 10(6)-10(7) times in some cases, and only 10(2) times in other cases. this difference was found in the tests made using the same attachment and in those made using various attachments. in conclusion, the tested instrument showed, in most cases, a good disinfectant property, but the presence of unclear results suggests that some technical modifications are required.

TI  == fatal craniocervical necrotizing fasciitis in an immunocompetent patient: a case  report and literature review.
AB  == background: craniocervical necrotizing fasciitis (ccnf) is a rapidly progressive, severe bacterial infection of the superficial fascial planes of the head and neck. group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus, staphylococcus aureus, and obligate anaerobic bacteria are common pathogens. the disease usually results from a dental source or facial trauma. extensive fascial necrosis and severe systemic toxicity are common manifestations of ccnf. recently the lay press has referred to necrotizing fasciitis in several articles about "flesh eating" bacteria, which have resulted in several deaths. methods: we report the first case of a fatality  in an otherwise immunocompetent patient. the patient was a 66-year-old black man  with no identifiable source of infection and no history or evidence of immunocompromising disorders. results: despite aggressive surgical debridement and broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, he died 30 hours after admission from multisystem organ failure secondary to overwhelming sepsis. conclusion: treatment consists of early recognition of ccnf combined with aggressive surgical debridement and drainage of the involved necrotic fascia and tissue along with broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic coverage. although 11 other fatal cases of  ccnf have been previously reported, all had an underlying medical problem which created an immunocompromised state, usually diabetes mellitus or chronic alcoholism. we present a case report and literature review along with a discussion of the related anatomy.

TI  == sequence analysis of the gene for a novel superantigen produced by yersinia pseudotuberculosis and expression of the recombinant protein.
AB  == we previously reported that the gram-negative bacterium yersinia pseudotuberculosis produces a superantigen (ypm, y. pseudotuberculosis-derived mitogen) that expands t cells bearing v betas 3, 9, 13.1, and 13.2 in an mhc class ii-dependent manner. based on the previously determined n-terminal 23 amino acids of ypm (t-d-y-d-n-t-l-n-s-i-p-s-l-r-i-p-n-i-a-t-y-t-g- (one-letter code)),  we cloned the ypm gene and analyzed the nucleotide sequence. the gene encodes a 151-amino acid protein with a 20-amino acid signal peptide at its n terminus. the recombinant ypm expressed by the cloned gene exerted a mitogenic activity on human pbmc at a concentration of approximately 1 pg/ml. t cells bearing v beta 13.3 were preferentially expanded as well as t cells bearing the same v beta repertoires stimulated by native ypm. t cells were stimulated by the recombinant  ypm in the presence of either fixed or unfixed hla class ii-transfected mouse fibroblasts. furthermore, sequence diversity in the junctional region of the tcr  beta-chain containing the v beta 3 element could be observed after stimulation by the recombinant ypm. these results indicate that ypm belongs to the category of superantigens and should be included as a novel member. the amino acid sequence of the mature protein showed no significant homology to other superantigens derived from gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. this observation, together with the substantially smaller m.w. suggest that ypm must have evolved from a different ancestral gene.

TI  == subclinical mastitis and milk production in primiparous simmental cows.
AB  == the prevalence of subclinical mastitis in beef cows was investigated and its relationship with milk production and 205-d adjusted calf weaning weights (adjww) determined. primiparous simmental cows (n = 25) were milked six times at approximately 30-d intervals. before each milking, milk samples were aseptically  collected from each quarter for bacteriological analyses. after recording milk weights, samples were obtained for determination of somatic cell counts (scc), butterfat (bf), and protein (pro). somatic cell counts were transformed to dairy  herd improvement association linear scores for statistical analyses. cows were retrospectively assigned to one of two groups based on their scc linear score being either less than (loscc) or more than (hiscc) 4.5, which corresponded to a  scc of 292 x 10(3) cells/ml. milk samples from 32% (8/25) of the cows and 18% (18/100) of the quarters were culture-positive for bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus species, actinomyces pyogenes,  and[or] coagulase-negative staphylococcus) at one or more times. milk production  was higher in loscc than in hiscc cows (6.3 +/- .2 vs 5.4 +/- .3 kg/24 h; p = .004). mean scc linear score tended to be negatively correlated with mean milk production over the entire study (r = -.36; p = .08). adjusted weaning weights were similar between calves suckling loscc and hiscc cows (243 +/- 5 vs 236 +/- 10 kg; p = .57). in summary, milk scc concentrations in primiparous simmental cows were highly variable. higher scc concentrations were associated with lower milk production in cows.

(b.)  catarrhalis, h. influenzae, and almost all of enterobacteriaceae were stronger than those of ampicillin (abpc) and piperacillin (pipc), but antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc were weak against mrsa and cephems (ceps)-resistant strains detected in some of enterobacteriaceae. 3. it appeared that benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive streptococcus pneumoniae (pisp) or pcg-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) and ceps-resistant escherichia coli increased  year by year. 4. antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc were strong against streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, m. (b.) catarrhalis and h. influenzae including beta-lactamase producing strains. additionally, beta-lactamase inhibiting effect of sbt was observed against beta-lactamase produced by s. aureus and k. pneumoniae which demonstrate indirect pathogenicity. thus, sbt/abpc is an injectable antibiotic that is expected to demonstrate clinical usefulness,  especially as the first line drug for the respiratory tract infections that are community-acquired.

AB  == bacteriology of the respiratory isolates from 2,539 patients with respiratory infections in 21 primary care clinics was documented. of a total of 1,887 strains of potential pathogens recovered from 1,507 patients, 996 were gram-positive and  891 were gram-negative. major pathogens were staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. the mic's against microbial isolates of six antimicrobial agents were determined. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were more active against s. aureus, moraxella catarrhalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ampicillin and cefteram were more active against s. pnuemoniae and s. pyogenes than four other antimicrobials tested, respectively, in this experiment. new quinolones and new generation cephems were active against h. influenzae and enterobacteriaceae. only one strain of s. aureus was methicillin-resistant. as regards other pathogens, 6.5% of s. pneumoniae and 14.9% of h. influenzae were resistant to ampicillin, and 26.7% of  h. influenzae were beta-lactamase-positive. mrsa was found infrequently. but ampicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae were found in primary care clinics almost as frequently as in intensive-medication-oriented clinics.

TI  == group a streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis: cost-effective diagnosis and treatment.
AB  == most patients who seek medical attention for sore throat are concerned about streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis, but fewer than 10% of adults and 30% of children actually have a streptococcal infection. group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (gas) are most often responsible for bacterial tonsillopharyngitis,  although neisseria gonorrhea, arcanobacterium haemolyticum (formerly corynebacterium haemolyticum), chlamydia pneumoniae (twar agent), and mycoplasma  pneumoniae have also been suggested as possible, infrequent, sporadic pathogens.  viruses or idiopathic causes account for the remainder of sore throat complaints. reliance on clinical impression to diagnose gas tonsillopharyngitis is problematic; an overestimation of 80% to 95% by experienced clinicians typically  occurs for adult patients. overtreatment promotes bacterial resistance, disturbs  natural microbial ecology, and may produce unnecessary side effects. existing data suggest that rapid gas antigen testing as an aid to clinical diagnosis can be very useful. when used appropriately, it is sensitive (79% to 88%) in detecting gas-infected patients and is specific (90% to 96%) and cost-effective.  penicillin has been the treatment of choice for gas tonsillopharyngitis since the 1950s; 10 days of treatment are necessary for bacterial eradication. a single im  injection of benzathine penicillin is effective and obviates compliance issues. until the early 1970s, the bacteriologic failure rate for the treatment of gas tonsillopharyngitis ranged from 2% to 10% and was attributed to chronic gas carriers. since the late 1970s, the penicillin failure rate has frequently exceeded 20% in published reports. explanations for recurrent gas tonsillopharyngitis include poor patient compliance; reacquisition from a family  member or peer, copathogenic colonization by staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, anaerobes that inactivate penicillin with beta-lactamase, or all these organisms; suppression of natural immune response by too-early administration of antibiotics; gas tolerance to penicillin; antibiotic  eradication of normal pharyngeal flora that normally act as natural host defenses; and establishment of a true carrier state. when therapy fails, milder symptoms may occur during the relapse. several antimicrobials have demonstrated superior efficacy compared with penicillin in eradicating gas and are administered less frequently to enhance patient compliance. in previously untreated gas throat infections, cephalosporins produce a 5% to 22% higher bacteriologic cure rate; after a penicillin treatment failure, these differences  are greater. amoxicillin/clavulanate and the extended-spectrum macrolides clarithromycin and azithromycin may also produce enhanced bacteriologic eradication in comparison to penicillin.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == persistent acute otitis media: ii. antimicrobial treatment.
AB  == in this three-year prospective study, 137 children with acute otitis media (aom)  that had not responded after one or two empiric antimicrobial treatment courses (termed persistent aom) underwent tympanocentesis to determine additional antimicrobial therapy based on in vitro susceptibility testing of the bacterial isolate(s). one hundred eleven children with aom not previously treated are described for comparison. in the persistent aom group middle ear aspirates grew streptococcus pneumoniae (24%), haemophilus influenzae (7%), brahamella catarrhalis (7%), streptococcus pyogenes (6%), staphylococcus aureus (5%), two pathogens (3%) or no bacterial growth (49%); pathogens in previously untreated aom were similar but fewer patients (30%) had no bacterial growth. after tympanocentesis additional antimicrobial therapy for persistent aom patients utilizing drugs shown to be effective in vitro against the isolated pathogen failed to produce clinical resolution of infection in 27 (28%) of ears. differing clinical efficacy was observed with various antimicrobials: amoxicillin (57% failure); trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (75% failure); cefaclor (37% failure); cefixime (23% failure); amoxicillin/clavulanate (12% failure); and cefuroxime axetil (13% failure). presumptive clinical cure for previously untreated aom patients was similar to that for untreated aom except for fewer amoxicillin failures (30%). we conclude that clinical failure in persistent aom occurs (1) even when no pathogen is isolated from tympanocentesis (50% of patients) and (2)  despite demonstrated in vitro activity against culture-proved pathogens.

TI  == [isolation of alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against pathogens, in the oral cavity and the effect of tobacco and gargling on oral flora].
AB  == we investigated the distribution of oral alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against pathogens, which compose an oral defense mechanism. detection rate of alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against s. pyogenes and s. aureus derived from the tonsil was higher than in other portions, the tongue, cheek, gingiva, or saliva. it has suggested that tonsillar bacterial flora are mainly a defense mechanism. the oral flora in healthy smokers was compared with healthy non-smokers to investigate the influence of tobacco on oral bacterial flora. the results showed that the detection rate of s. aureus in smokers was higher while that of alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against s. aureus was lower. however, the detection rate of alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against s. pyogenes in smokers was as high as in non-smokers. it is suggested that it was easy for s. aureus to adhere to the oral mucosa in smokers, and was considered to influence the strain which produces beta-lactamase for medical treatment. we investigated the influence of gargling on oral bacterial flora by comparing the amount of bacteria before and after gargling with popidine-iodine gargle and saline solution. it was shown that alpha-streptococci, a main component of normal oral flora were decreased after gargling in both smokers and non-smokers. furthermore, it was shown that group a  streptococcus was not decreased after gargling, and it was concluded that use of  gargle medicinal mouth wash in bacillus carriers should be studied further.

TI  == macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha expression in vivo and in vitro: the role of lipoteichoic acid.
AB  == lipoteichoic acid (lta), a component of the cell wall of most gram-positive bacteria, has been shown to play a significant role in the initiation and progression of bacterial infection. however, little is known of its position in the cytokine network involved in the induction and perpetuation of inflammation.  in this study, we assessed whether the macrophage activating and chemotactic cytokine macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (mip-1 alpha) was expressed in the setting of localized gram-positive infection. furthermore, we determined whether lta purified from either staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes  could induce the expression of mip-1 alpha mrna and protein from human blood monocytes. immunohistochemical staining of human endocardial samples obtained from patients with acute s. aureus endocarditis revealed cell-associated mip-1 alpha expression by neutrophils, macrophages, and fibroblasts. treatment of human peripheral blood monocytes in vitro with lta isolated from either s. aureus or s. pyogenes resulted in both the time- and dose-dependent expression of mip-1 alpha  mrna. similarly, staphylococcal and streptococcal lta induced the dose-dependent  production of mip-1 alpha protein after 24 h in culture. these studies suggest that lta may play an important role in triggering the recruitment and activation  of leukocytes that characterizes the host response to gram-positive bacterial invasion.

TI  == characterization of an erythromycin resistance (erm) plasmid in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == three erythromyxin-resistant swedish isolates of streptococcus pyogenes, representing different t-types, were studied. two of the strains showed constitutive high-level (mic > 200 micrograms/ml) and one showed moderate (mic 6.4 micrograms/ml) resistance; the latter strain was sensitive to lincosamide and clindamycin, and resistance was not induced by erythromycin. in each of the strains, a plasmid with an estimated mw of 17.6 +/- 0.9 x 10(6) was isolated in addition to smaller cryptic plasmids. the three plasmids pse701, pse702, and pse703 had very similar restriction enzyme cleavage patterns. novobiocin curing of the high-level resistance strain er559 showed the resistance to be linked to its 17.6 x 10(6) plasmid, pse703. furthermore, by electroporation this rather large plasmid was reintroduced into an erythromycin-sensitive cured derivative, acquiring resistance, and the plasmid was again recovered from the transconjugant. one of the plasmids, pse702, was shown by filter mating to be conjugative within s. pyogenes. dna-dna hybridization showed that the resistance  determinant of the present three isolates was related to the erm gene on plasmid  pam beta 1 of enterococcus faecalis but not to that of plasmid pe194 of staphylococcus aureus. the copy numbers of pse702 and pse703, derived from the two high-level resistant strains, were 11 +/- 3 and 17 +/- 5 compared to 2 +/- 1  for pse701, derived from the moderately resistant strain, possibly accounting for the phenotypic variation observed. the plasmids pse702 and pam beta 1 showed about 80% homology in dna-dna hybridization tests and high similarity in their restriction maps.

TI  == [spiramycin (rovamycin), a macrolide antibiotic for oral treatment of outpatient  pneumonia].
AB  == spiramycin activity against acute pneumonia has been studied in 21 outpatients (15 adults and 6 children). the drug was administered orally twice daily in a dose 3,000,000 units. the course lasted from 7 to 14 days. all the cases were confirmed roentgenologically. the disease ran a moderate-severity course. the response rate reached 95.2%. another course of antibiotic therapy was not needed. side effects were not registered. bacteriological efficacy of spiramycin made up  71.3%. 14 out of 16 isolated strains of causative agents (s.pneumoniae, s.pyogenes, s.aureus, h.influenzae in 5, 1, 7 and 3 patients, respectively) proved sensitive to spiramycin. 2 patients developed mycoplasma infection diagnosed serologically. the findings confirm high therapeutic efficacy of spiramycin, its good tolerance. spiramycin may be considered the drug of the priority choice in outpatient treatment of acute pneumonia.

TI  == characterization and distribution of insertion sequence is1239 in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the human pathogenic bacterium streptococcus pyogenes causes pharyngitis, acute rheumatic fever, glomerulonephritis and toxic-shock-like syndrome. the bacterium  synthesizes several extracellular products, including the recently described streptococcal superantigen ssa, a molecule that shares considerable homology with several staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins. while studying allelic variation at the ssa locus, six isolates expressing serotypes m4, m23, m33, m41, m43, and provisional type pt4854, were identified that had pcr products about 40-bp larger than expected, and one isolate (m15) had an amplified fragment that was more than 1-kb larger than expected. all six isolates have a 34-bp insert located 103 bp 5' of the ssa start codon. the larger product is a result of a 1110-bp insertion at  the analogous location. the complementary strand of this insert has a 981-bp open reading frame that potentially encodes a 326-amino-acid polypeptide with substantial homology to the escherichia coli is30 transposase. results of southern blot analysis showed that at least twelve copies of the sequence are present in the serotype m15 s. pyogenes isolate. this element, designated is1239, is the first simple insertion sequence described in group-a streptococci. results of pcr screening showed that 26 of 78 (33%) s. pyogenes isolates expressing distinct m protein serotypes contained sequences with homology to is1239, which means that the element is widely distributed in the species.

TI  == activation of arachidonic acid metabolism in mouse macrophages by bacterial amphiphiles.
AB  == the relative activities of lipoteichoic acid (lta) from four gram-positive bacteria were compared to different lipopolysaccharide (lps) preparations for activation of arachidonic acid metabolism in mouse peritoneal macrophages. total  eicosanoid was determined in cultures labeled with [3h]-arachidonic acid. prostaglandin e2 (pge2) and leukotriene c4 (ltc4) were determined by eia analysis. the relative potencies of the different preparations were: smooth lps from salmonella abortus > or = re-lps from salmonella minnesota (r-595) > or = lta from streptococcus pyogenes approximately streptococcus faecalis approximately staphylococcus aureus > or = monophosphoryl lipid a derived from the re-lps >> lta from bacillus subtilis. activation of eicosanoid release was inhibited by staurosporin for all of the amphiphiles tested. treatment of the macrophage cultures with lta from s. pyogenes, s. faecalis, and s. aureus, either in the presence or absence of indomethacin, desensitized the cells to eicosanoid  release on subsequent challenge with lps. the desensitized cells remained responsive to the phorbol ester phorbol myristate acetate. lps from gram-negative bacteria has immunostimulatory and endotoxic activities which result, in part, from the release of eicosanoids and other mediators from activated macrophages. the similarities in the patterns of cell activation by lps and lta suggest that lipoteichoic acids might contribute to the pathogenicities of gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == toxic shock syndrome related to simultaneous staphylococcus aureus epiglottic abscess and group a streptococcal pharyngitis with bacteremia.
AB  == a case of toxic shock syndrome (tss) is reported in which both a tsst-1-producing staphylococcus aureus strain and a group a beta-hemolytic streptococcal strain (gabhs) were involved. the s. aureus group i strain was isolated from an epiglottic abscess, and the gabhs strain from tonsils and blood cultures. acute intubation was needed because of obstruction of the airways by swollen and hyperemic mucous membranes in the oro- and hypopharynx together with external edema around the neck. intravenous therapy with penicillin g was instituted initially on account of gabhs cellulitis and bacteremia. the patient's condition  deteriorated during this treatment, and improvement did not occur until drainage  and intravenous dicloxacillin therapy was instituted. it is not possible in this  case to draw any conclusions as to which of the two organisms caused the tss or if they were both involved.

TI  == intraphagocytic killing of gram-positive bacteria by ciprofloxacin.
AB  == the intraphagocytic killing of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and corynebacterium group d2 by ciprofloxacin (0.1, 1 and 5 mg/l) within human neutrophils was determined. the organisms showed different susceptibility to neutrophil killing mechanisms. the neutrophils with intact and impaired (by phenylbutazone treatment) o2-dependent killing mechanisms were studied. the minimum concentrations of ciprofloxacin to kill 90% of phagocytosed bacteria within untreated neutrophils after 2 h were 1 mg/l for s. aureus and corynebacterium group d2, and 0.1 mg/l for s. pyogenes. in contrast, exposure for 3 h was required to achieve similar cidal effects within phenylbutazone treated neutrophils. synergic interaction between ciprofloxacin and the o2-dependent mechanisms of phagocytes was found. the reactive oxygen metabolites produced in the respiratory burst did not affect the intraphagocytic activity of ciprofloxacin. phenylbutazone treatment of phagocytes would be a good experimental model to study intraphagocytic killing by drugs in situations where  the oxidative mechanisms of neutrophils are impaired (for example aids and chronic granulomatous disease).

TI  == development of a polymerase chain reaction assay to detect the presence of streptococcus pneumoniae dna.
AB  == in this study, we have developed a chemically sensitive and specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay to detect the presence of streptococcus pneumoniae genomic dna. the target dna sequence was a 322-base pair segment of the s. pneumoniae dna polymerase i gene (pol i). pcr products of pure cultures of a set  of pneumococcal serotypes commonly associated with human infection could be amplified in water and in blood cultures of clinical isolates containing s. pneumoniae. we were able to detect 2 fg of purified s. pneumoniae dna. there were no false-positive reactions when the assay was performed on samples containing the following clinically encountered bacteria: haemophilus influenzae type b, neisseria meningitidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas spp. nontypeable h. influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and streptococcus pyogenes. the addition of edta and citrate-anticoagulated whole blood to the pcr reaction mixture inhibited the pcr  assay, whereas the addition of lithium heparin, sodium heparin, and sodium polyanetholesulfonate-anticoagulated whole blood to pcr reaction mixture did not  interfere with the ability to detect the presence of s. pneumoniae dna.

TI  == bacterial interference in vitro. comparison between a quantitative kinetic and a  cocultivation blood agar test method.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to compare two methods for estimation of bacterial growth interference between various bacteria using a bioscreen robot analyzer, allowing kinetic documentation, and a cocultivation test on blood agar  plates. six laboratory strains with different virulence and growth requirements were used: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mitis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. the interference activity was correlated with a reference system of streptococcus sanguis (strain alpha 89) and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococci, gas serotypes t 9 and t 22). the methods used and results obtained were as follows: 1. estimation of synergistic and antagonistic bacterial interferences using a bioscreen robot analyzer. suspensions of viable bacteria were added to microtiter plates with different concentrations of uv light-killed bacteria in liquid media. the bioscreen analyzer monitored bacterial growth every 10 min for 24 h giving kinetic data during the growth period. synergisms as well as antagonisms were demonstrated between the tested bacterial  strains which have not earlier been reported in the literature. however, the antagonistic effect observed between the six strains was less than that induced by the s. sanguis strain on the two strains of s. pyogenes. 2. cocultivation of bacterial strains on blood agar surface with precultivated or simultaneously stamped interfering bacteria indicated no detectable interference between the six tested bacterial strains, while the s. sanguis strain inhibited the growth of s.  pyogenes strains as well as the hemolysis around the colonies. the bioscreen method was found more sensitive for testing bacterial interference compared to the commonly used blood agar test.

TI  == acute otorrhea: bacteriology of a common complication of tympanostomy tubes.
AB  == we prospectively followed 246 children with tympanostomy tubes and observed acute otorrhea through a functioning tube at least once in 50% of subjects. pathogens typical of acute otitis media (streptococcus pneumoniae, hemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pyogenes) were found in 42% of all episodes; pseudomonas aeruginosa or staphylococcus aureus was found in 44% of all episodes. pathogens of acute otitis media were found in 50.0% of subjects under 6 years old versus 4.4% of subjects 6 years or over at the first episode (p < .001). pseudomonas aeruginosa was found more often in children 6 years or older (43.5% versus 20.5% at the first episode, p = .052). pathogens typical of acute otitis media were less prevalent in the summer months (14.7% versus 52.2% for the first episode, p = .001), while p aeruginosa was more prevalent in summer (44.1%  versus 16.4% for the first episode, p = .006). this suggests that while many younger children with acute otorrhea may respond to treatment with oral antimicrobials alone, outpatient therapy of older children may involve use of topical antipseudomonal agents that may be complicated by the question of the safety of such medications.

TI  == cloning, sequencing, and expression of a fibronectin/fibrinogen-binding protein from group a streptococci.
AB  == lipoteichoic acid and several streptococcal proteins have been reported to bind fibronectin (fn) or fibrinogen (fgn), which may serve as host receptors. we searched for such proteins by screening a library of genes from m type 5 group a  streptococci cloned into escherichia coli. lysates of clones were probed with biotinylated fn and biotinylated fgn. one clone expressed a 54-kda protein that reacted with fn and fgn. the protein, termed fbp54, was purified and used to immunize rabbits. anti-fbp54 serum reacted with purified, recombinant fbp54 and with a protein of similar electrophoretic mobility in extracts of m type 5, 6, and 24 streptococci. anti-fbp54 serum also reacted with 5 of 15 strains of intact, live streptococci, suggesting that fbp54 may be a surface antigen. southern blot analysis confirmed that the gene is found in group a streptococci but not in staphylococcus aureus or e. coli. the cloned gene was sequenced and contained an open reading frame encoding a protein with a calculated molecular weight of 54,186. partial amino acid sequencing of purified fbp54 confirmed that  this open reading frame encoded the protein. as determined by utilizing fusion proteins containing truncated forms of fbp54, the primary fn/fgn-binding domain appears to be contained in residues 1 to 89. these data suggest that fbp54 may be a surface protein of streptococci that reacts with both fn and fgn and therefore  may participate in the adhesion of group a streptococci to host cells.

AB  == i have touched briefly here on the complex matrix of social, economic, political, and ecologic factors that have played a major role in the emergence of microbial  diseases. but beyond these factors that contribute to the emergence of new infectious diseases, we must also recognize changes in microbial agents, human populations, insect vectors, and the ecologic relationships among them. microbes  and vectors swim in the evolutionary stream and they swim much faster than we do. bacteria reproduce every 30 min; for them a millennium is compressed into a fortnight. microbes were here, learning every trick for survival, 2 billion years before humans arrived, and it is likely that they will be here 2 billion years after we depart. furthermore, science cannot halt the future occurrence of new microbes, which emerge from the evolutionary stream as a consequence of genetic events and selective pressures that favor the new over the old. it is nature's way. for all of these reasons, old and new infections will occur in the future as they have in the past. surveillance efforts, both in the united states and other  regions of the world, will be needed to blunt the emergence of such infections and to forestall epidemics and pandemics. but surveillance alone cannot detect the unexpected emergence of future microbes or prepare the defense against them.  that will require a broadly based research effort to devise new methods of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. we must swim with the microbes and study their survival and adaptation to new habitats.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == fibronectin receptors from gram-positive bacteria: comparison of active sites.
AB  == many parasitic bacteria express fibronectin binding proteins that are located on  the cell surface. these proteins may act as adhesins and mediate the adherence of the microorganisms to fibronectin-containing host tissues. the ligand binding sites in the fibronectin receptor proteins from gram-positive bacteria are composed of unique 37-48 amino acid long motifs that are repeated 3-4 times. we have now expressed the ligand binding sites of fibronectin receptors from staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus dysgalactiae (two receptors), and streptococcus pyogenes as recombinant proteins. the purified recombinant proteins have the expected molecular weights as indicated by electrospray mass spectroscopy although they migrate abnormally on sds-page. each recombinant protein effectively inhibited the binding of 125i-labeled intact fibronectin or the n-terminal fibronectin domain to staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus dysgalactiae, and streptococcus pyogenes. the relative inhibitory potency of the  different recombinant proteins was similar for all target bacteria and is reflected in their relative affinities for fibronectin. synthetic peptides corresponding to the repeat units of the ligand binding site of the fibronectin receptor proteins were shown to inhibit the binding of the n-terminal fibronectin fragment to streptococcus pyogenes cells. together with amino acid sequence comparison, these data demonstrate that the repeat motif of the fibronectin receptor of streptococcus pyogenes conforms to the consensus sequence previously  reported for the staphylococcus aureus receptor and to one of the streptococcus dysgalactiae receptors (mcgavin et al., 1993).

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. the advantages of in vitro activity of fk037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (mic90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus (h-mrsa), (3) a strong activity against enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (mic90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for escherichia coli,  0.1 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for haemophilus influenzae and proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis and moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for c. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant s. aureus (l-mrsa), enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for h-mrsa and serratia marcescens.  fk037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except mrsa, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except p. vulgaris and/or m. catarrhalis. the increase in mics of fk037 against 2 l-mrsa strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. fk037 was highly bactericidal against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa at the mic or higher. fk037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against h-mrsa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. against the other strains, fk037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa. transmission electron microscopic  studies revealed that fk037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in mrsa after 4 h incubation.

TI  == penetration of ceftriaxone into the intervertebral disc.
AB  == concentrations of ceftriaxone in serum and intervertebral disc tissue were determined with high-pressure liquid chromatography in forty-five patients after  a single intravenous loading dose of 1000 milligrams given at different intervals before an operation on the spine. the mean serum concentrations in this study corresponded well with reported values. the mean tissue concentrations were 5.6 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 3.6 to 6.8 micrograms per gram) one to less than two hours after administration of the antibiotic, 6.4 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 2.8 to 10.0 micrograms per  gram) two to less than four hours, and 3.6 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 0.6 to 6.6 micrograms per gram) at fourteen to less than sixteen hours. these drug concentrations exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration that was effective against 90 per cent of the bacteria for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus; for streptococcus pyogenes, agalactiae, viridans, pneumoniae, and bovis; and for community-acquired enterobacteriaceae. the average serum-to-tissue ratio was 191:1 at less than one-half hour and 13:1 at less than one and a half hours. the lower values of the 95 per cent confidence intervals for the concentration of the antibiotic exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentrations in the disc tissue against most susceptible bacteria during the period between one and a half and four hours, but a larger bolus would be needed to maintain this level for a longer period (such as in a longer operation) and as prophylaxis against methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci.

TI  == modulation of pseudomonas aeruginosa adherence to the corneal surface by mucus.
AB  == to gain access to the corneal epithelium and cause infections keratitis, bacterial pathogens must first interact with ocular surface factors that could affect bacterial adherence. in this study, we demonstrated that the mucus layer,  and, in particular, the mucin fraction of mucus, modulated adherence to intact corneal epithelium of pseudomonas aeruginosa but not that of staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes. removal of endogenous mucus from rat or rabbit  eyes increased the adherence of p. aeruginosa by 3- to 10-fold. ocular mucus obtained from rat eyes, porcine stomach mucin, or bovine submaxillary gland mucin inhibited adherence of p. aeruginosa to uninjured corneal epithelium. the mucin fraction of ocular mucus, purified by ultracentrifugation, was found to contain the inhibitory activity, and inhibition was demonstrated at concentrations of mucin as low as 35 micrograms/ml. ocular mucin was the only material tested that  inhibited adherence of p. aeruginosa to an injured cornea. however, the binding of p. aeruginosa to immobilized substrates in vitro did not predict which fraction would possess antiadherence activity: bacteria bound well to whole ocular mucus, mucin, the nonmucin fraction of ocular mucus, and dilute human tears as well as to porcine stomach mucin and bovine submaxillary gland mucin. the effectiveness of the mucin fraction of ocular mucus at inhibiting the binding of p. aeruginosa to the cornea implies that this material is a barrier that protects the surface of the eye from p. aeruginosa adherence.

TI  == photochemical inactivation of pathogenic bacteria in human platelet concentrates.
AB  == platelet concentrates (pc) may be infrequently contaminated with low levels of bacteria that can cause septicemia and death in patients receiving transfusion therapy. we evaluated the efficacy of a photochemical decontamination (pcd) technique using 8-methoxypsoralen (8-mop) and long wavelength uv light (uva) to inactivate bacteria in standard therapeutic pc. twelve phylogenetically distinct  pathogenic bacteria, 5 gram-positive and 7 gram-negative organisms, were seeded into pc to a final challenge dose ranging from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. contaminated pc were treated with 8-mop (5 micrograms/ml) and 5 j/cm2 of uva, a pcd treatment regimen found to adequately preserve in vitro platelet function. greater than 10(5) cfu/ml of all 5 gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, and corynebacterium minutissimum) and 2 of the gram-negative (escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica) organisms were inactivated. the remaining 5 gram-negative organisms were more resistant, with less than 10(1) to 10(3.7) cfu/ml inactivated under these conditions. the inactivation efficiency for this resistant group of gram-negative organisms was improved when pc were resuspended in a synthetic storage medium with reduced plasma protein concentration (15%) and an increased 8-mop concentration (23.4 micrograms/ml). illumination with 3 j/cm2 of uva in this system inactivated greater than 10(5) cfu/ml of 4 resistant gram-negative organisms (salmonella choleraesuis, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and klebsiella pneumoniae) and 10(4.1) cfu/ml of the most resistant gram-negative organism (pseudomonas aeruginosa). this level of pcd treatment did not adversely affect in vitro platelet function. these results demonstrate that pcd using 8-mop (5 to 23.4 micrograms/ml) effectively inactivated high levels of pathogenic bacteria in pc with adequate preservation of in vitro platelet properties.

AB  == cefditoren pivoxil (cdtr-pi, me1207) granules, a new oral cephem, was given to pediatric patients with infectious diseases to evaluate antibacterial activities  against clinical isolates, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and safety, and the following results were obtained. 1. in sensitivity test, 30 strains were used comprised of 5 species, isolated from the patients before administered with cdtr-pi. against staphylococcus aureus, mics of 7 agents, cefditoren (cdtr), cefaclor, cefixime, cefteram, cefotiam, cefpodoxime and methicillin, were determined. against other 4 species, mics of the above 6 agents excluding methicillin were determined. among gram-positive cocci tested, the mics of cdtr were 0.78 to 100 micrograms/ml or higher against s. aureus (16 strains), < or = 0.025 microgram/ml against streptococcus pyogenes (5 strains), and 0.10 or 0.39 microgram/ml against streptococcus pneumoniae (2 strains). these values were equal to or lower than those of conventional cephems and of methicillin. among gram-negative rods tested, the mics of cdtr were < or = 0.025 microgram/ml against haemophilus influenzae (3 strains), and 0.10 or 0.20 microgram/ml against escherichia coli (4 strains). also, these values were equal to or lower than those of conventional cephems. 2. when cdtr-pi granules was orally administered in a single dose of 3.0 mg/kg to 1 patient and that of 6.0 mg/kg to 2 patients 30 minutes after meal, plasma cdtr concentrations reached their maxima 4 hours after administration in the former patient and 1 or 2 hours after administration in the latter 2 patients, and the peak plasma concentrations were 1.91, 3.46 and 4.82 micrograms/ml with half-lives of 1.01, 0.81 and 0.88 hours and aucs of 8.62, 9.89 and 13.52 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. dose-dependency was observed for the peak plasma concentrations and aucs also tended to depend on dose excepting for the auc in one 6.0 mg/kg patient. 3. the urinary concentrations in the above patients reached their peaks at 4 to 6 hours after administration in one 3.0 mg/kg patient and at 4 to 6 hours and 2 to 4 hours after administration in two 6.0 mg/kg patients, and the corresponding values were 126.0, 195.0 and 234.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. recovery rates in the first 8 hours after administration were 18.2, 24.6 and 21.3%, respectively. 4. of 53 patients with 13 diseases, cdtr-pi was clinically judged "excellent" in 32 (60.4%) and "good" in 21 (39.6%), showing excellent efficacy. 5. bacteriologically, excellent results were obtained, i.e., 29 (96.7%) of 30 strains from 5 species were eradicated. 6.  side effects were observed in none of the 54 patients treated.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == antimicrobial activity of cefuroxime axetil (cxm-ax) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains obtained mainly from outpatients of our center in a period from january to september of 1990 and 1993. minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined and the following results were  obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic80 of cxm were equal to or lower against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, peptostreptococcus spp., and propionibacterium acnes, except for streptococcus pneumoniae, mic80 which was slightly higher. 2. mic90 of comparator drugs reflected those of new resistant organisms recently appeared, such as benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephem-resistant e. coli and klebsiella spp., new quinolone-resistant h. influenzae and n. gonorrhoeae. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was detected also from specimens of community acquired infections. from the nature of mrsa detected in those situations mrsa appeared to present a continuing problem. 3. mic90 against strains obtained from  patients with community acquired infections was a good index of increases of multidrug-resistant organisms in the past. therefore, the determination of mic90  is important in examining changes with time of sensitivities or resistances of clinically isolated strains to antimicrobial drugs. 4. antimicrobial activities of cxm against recent clinical isolates showed the existence of problems as mentioned above. however, mic of cxm as well as those of comparator drugs indicated that antimicrobial activities of cxm against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., h. influenzae appeared to be relatively strong, and it is concluded that cefuroxime axetil still is one of the clinically useful oral antimicrobial drugs in the 1990's.

AB  == we studied the efficacy of antimicrobial agents against staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and streptococcus pyogenes (s. pyogenes) isolated from skin infections in 1992. for s. aureus, we measured the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of  the following 10 drugs: methicillin (dmppc), cefaclor (ccl), gentamicin (gm), erythromycin (em), clindamycin (cldm), minocycline (mino), vancomycin (van), fusidic acid (fa), ofloxacin (oflx) and nadifloxacin (ndfx); for s. pyogenes, we  determined the mics of the following 9 drugs: ampicillin (abpc), amoxicillin (ampc), cefpodoxime proxetil (cpdx-pr), erythromycin (em), clindamycin (cldm), minocycline (mino), norfloxacin (nflx), of loxacin (oflx) and nadifloxacin (ndfx). these drugs are frequently used to treat skin infections, either systemically or topically. ndfx is a new synthetic fluoroquinolone, recently developed for use as a topical acne medication in japan. it is used ndfx for acne, but not for skin infections. there were no strains of s. aureus resistant to ndfx, van or fa. the resistance (> or = 12.5 micrograms/ml) of s. aureus was highest to gm and lowest to oflx. four strains of methicillin-resistant (> or = 12.5 micrograms/ml) s. aureus (mrsa) were found. in contrast, no resistant strains of s. pyogenes were found except to mino. only two strains of s. pyogenes were susceptible to mino. the sensitivity of s. pyogenes to abpc, ampc, cpdx-pr,  em and cldm was very good. all the strains were susceptible at a mic below > or = 0.05 microgram/ml. however, the s. pyogenes strains were not very sensitive to the new quinolones, especially nflx. we concluded that penicillins, cephalosporins and macrolides are still effective against streptococcal infections.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == criteria for the assessment of adverse effects of chemotherapy on the oral microflora.
AB  == any assessment of an antimicrobial agent for the prevention of dental caries must include a consideration of its possible adverse effects on the oral flora. it must include an examination of the resistance developed by the target pathogens and either developed by, or inherently present in, microorganisms that are known  to cause opportunistic infections (yeasts, enteric organisms, pseudomonas, clostridia, and staphylococcus aureus). streptococcus pyogenes should also be included. insofar as possible, these assessments should be done in preliminary experiments, both in vitro and clinical, rather than in caries trials, so that the large numbers of subjects will not be submitted to unnecessary exposure to the formulation. it must be recognized that some combinations of agent, vehicle,  and frequency are more prone than others to cause adverse effects on the oral flora, and will also influence the length of the test period that should be utilized. the microbial assessments should be done on subjects prior to use of the agent, at appropriate frequencies during therapy, and approximately 2 months  after the cessation of therapy. currently, requirements to assess the state of gingival or periodontal health by microbiological examination seem unjustified, because of the relative lack of strong evidence for their diagnostic or predictive value (ranney, 1989) and because of the ease with which direct measurements of clinical signs and symptoms can be made. consequently, only the latter should be required.

TI  == the type i macrophage scavenger receptor binds to gram-positive bacteria and recognizes lipoteichoic acid.
AB  == macrophage scavenger receptors exhibit unusually broad binding specificity for polyanionic ligands and have been implicated in atherosclerosis and various host  defense functions. using a radiolabeled, secreted form of the type i bovine macrophage scavenger receptor in an in vitro binding assay, we have found that this receptor binds to intact gram-positive bacteria, including streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus hirae, and listeria monocytogenes. competition binding studies using purified lipoteichoic acid, an anionic polymer expressed on the surface of most gram-positive bacteria, show that lipoteichoic acids are scavenger receptor ligands and probably mediate binding of the receptor to gram-positive bacteria. lipoteichoic acids, for which no host cell receptors have previously been identified, are implicated in the pathogenesis of septic shock due to gram-positive bacteria. scavenger receptors may participate in host defense by clearing lipoteichoic acid and/or intact bacteria from tissues and the circulation during gram-positive sepsis. since scavenger receptors have been previously shown to bind to and facilitate bloodstream clearance of gram-negative bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide), these receptors may provide a general mechanism for macrophage recognition and internalization of pathogens and their cell surface components.

TI  == immune response in the lungs following oral immunization with bacterial lysates of respiratory pathogens.
AB  == we have investigated the local immune response of the balb/c mouse respiratory tract after oral immunization with a bacterial lysate of seven common respiratory pathogens. after two immunization on five consecutive days, we examined the immunoglobulin (immunoglobulin g [igg], igm, and iga) secretion rates of cells isolated from the lungs and compared them with those of spleen cells of orally immunized and nonimmunized animals by using a new test system based on time-resolved fluorescence. the procedure followed the principle of the classical elispot test with nitrocellulose-bottomed microtiter plates, but europium (eu3+)-linked streptavidin rather than enzyme-conjugated streptavidin was used, with the advantage of quantifying secreted immunoglobulins instead of detecting single antibody-secreting cells. lymphocytes isolated from the lungs of treated animals revealed significant increases in total and antigen-specific iga synthesis compared with the rates of the controls, whereas igg and igm production rates showed no remarkable differences. in addition, the sera of treated mice revealed higher antigen-specific iga titers but not increased igm and igg levels. we conclude that priming the gut-associated lymphoid tissue with bacterial antigens of pneumotropic microorganisms can elicit an enhanced iga response in a  distant mucosal effector site, such as the respiratory tract, according to the concept of a common mucosa-associated immune system.

TI  == penicillin failure and copathogenicity in streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis.
AB  == recurrent group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus (gabhs) pharyngotonsillitis related to penicillin failure presents a serious clinical problem. failure to eradicate streptococci from patients can occasionally lead to rheumatic fever and rarely to glomerulonephritis. beta-lactamase-producing strains of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in inflamed tonsils have been associated with increased failure rates of penicillins in the eradication of these infections. these organisms include staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae and h parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, fusobacterium sp, and pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp. the indirect pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent  in their ability not only to survive penicillin therapy but also to protect penicillin-susceptible pathogens from that drug. these organisms have demonstrated the ability to protect gabhs in vitro and in vivo from penicillin. numerous reports have described the successful therapy of recurrent gabhs tonsillitis with antimicrobials directed at both gabhs and the beta-lactamase-producing organisms.

AB  == in the present study the level of antimicrobial antibodies and the phagocytosis-promoting activity in immunoglobulin preparations produced for intravenous use were assessed. the level of antibodies directed against various microorganisms in six immunoglobulin preparations was determined by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) and was shown to be either equal to or  higher than that of pooled normal human serum. all preparations were able to promote phagocytosis of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli k12, and streptococcus pyogenes by human granulocytes. substantial differences among the various preparations in antibody activity were noted. in particular, intraglobulin, chemically modified by beta-propiolactone treatment, exhibited little activity in both the elisa and the phagocytosis assay. in contrast, ivig src, gamimmune, sandoglobulin (treated at low ph in presence or absence of trace  amounts of pepsin), and gammagard (treated by ion-exchange chromatography) showed good activity in both assays. comparison of the results of the elisa and phagocytosis assay for the various preparations indicated a good correlation except for s. aureus with a moderate (strain 42d) or high (strain cowan i) protein a content. these data indicate that the antibody activity of immunoglobulin preparations against various microorganisms determined by elisa can be used to predict their opsonic activity.

TI  == [incurable bacterial skin infection].
AB  == the most dominant species isolated from bacterial skin infection is always staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus). the frequency of isolation of methicillin resistant s. aureus (mrsa) has recently been increasing in skin infections. mrsa  is resistant to many kinds of antibiotics, therefore, mrsa infections is incurable, in many cases. mrsa are isolated most often from infectious decubitus  or leg ulcers, in compromised hosts. s. aureus is etiologically related to atopic dermatitis. simultaneously with s. aureus, there is a increasing frequency of isolation of streptococcus pyogenes (s. pyogenes) in atopic dermatitis. s. pyogenes infections are much more severe because patients infected with s. pyogenes have fever and/or concurrent kidney disorders. in these skin disorders,  there is severe skin damage or defect, so that, it may be very difficult to eradicate mrsa in decubitus, ulcers and s. pyogenes in atopic dermatitis.

TI  == lipoteichoic acid induces secretion of interleukin-8 from human blood monocytes:  a cellular and molecular analysis.
AB  == invasion by gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial organisms is characterized  immunopathologically by the activation of mononuclear phagocytic cells, leading to the elaboration of macrophage-derived regulatory and chemotactic factors, and  the resultant influx of inflammatory leukocytes. little is known regarding the mechanisms by which gram-positive organisms initiate macrophage activation and subsequent inflammation. in this investigation, we postulated that lipoteichoic acid (lta) purified from two different gram-positive bacterial species was an important signal for the expression of chemotactic cytokines from human peripheral blood monocytes (pbm). in initial experiments, we demonstrated that cell-associated interleukin-8 (il-8) was expressed by mononuclear phagocytes present in inflamed areas of endocardium in cases of acute staphylococcus aureus  endocarditis. we next demonstrated that lta purified from either staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes induced the time- and dose-dependent expression  of il-8 mrna and protein from human pbm. the expression of il-8 mrna from lta- but not lipopolysaccharide (lps)-treated pbm was superinduced by concomitant treatment with cycloheximide, indicating that the expression of il-8 mrna from lta-treated pbm was negatively controlled by repressor proteins. furthermore, mrna stability studies indicated that il-8 mrna was less stable in the presence of lta than in the presence of lps. our findings indicate that lta can induce the secretion of the polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotactic factor il-8 and that lta may be an important cellular mediator of inflammatory cell recruitment that characterizes immune responses to gram-positive bacterial infections.

TI  == superantigens.
AB  == "superantigens" is the term for a group of molecules that have in common an extremely potent stimulatory activity for t lymphocytes of several species. they  stimulate cd4+, cd8+ and gamma delta + t cells by a unique mechanism: they cross-link variable parts of the t-cell receptor (tcr) with mhc class ii molecules on accessory or target cells. the interaction site on the class ii molecule and on the tcr is different from the peptide binding site; on the tcr it is the variable part of the beta chain (v beta). the prototype superantigen is the staphylococcal enterotoxin b (seb), member of a family of genetically related proteins produced by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. these are  soluble exotoxins of approximately 27 kd molecular mass. it is intriguing that this molecular mechanism of t-cell stimulation has been independently produced at least three times in evolution. other pathogens producing superantigens are retroviruses (the mouse mammary tumor viruses) and a mycoplasma (mycoplasma arthritidis). many additional candidate superantigens have been proposed, but in  most cases unequivocal evidence for superantigen activity is still missing. there are several reasons why these molecules have aroused such tremendous interest in  recent years. first, they have provided key information on tolerance mechanisms,  both on the deletion of t cells in the thymus and on the induction of peripheral  tolerance by anergy and apoptosis. second, of all polyclonal t-cell stimulators they are the ones that most closely mimic the recognition of specific antigen. finally, they have been recognized as important factors in the pathogenicity of the producing pathogens, inducing shock and immunosuppression. whilst there is evidence that superantigens could be involved in the pathogenesis of certain human diseases, in most cases this is still very preliminary and indirect.

TI  == bacterial resistance in eastern europe--selected problems.
AB  == the profile of infection and pattern of bacterial resistance in eastern europe is distinct from that observed in other parts of the world. several polish investigations have reported that environmental pollution may increase the risk of respiratory disease. studies from hungary and romania have documented a dramatic increase in the proportion of streptococcus pneumoniae strains resistant to antibiotics. in comparison, resistance to these agents amongst polish pneumococci isolates is lower, although these pathogens and streptococcus pyogenes have displayed increasing tetracycline resistance. 20% of polish haemophilus influenzae isolates and a high percentage of moraxella catarrhalis strains exhibit ampicillin resistance. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) has been found to constitute 22% of polish s. aureus strains. two major clones of mrsa have been identified in poland which differ in their degree  of antimicrobial resistance. the pattern of antimicrobial resistance amongst polish respiratory pathogens is undoubtedly a reflection of management policies and the use of these drugs. it is hoped that the economic and political changes taking place within eastern europe will provide the information and resources to  establish more efficient infection control and antibiotic policy and thus delay and limit the appearance of bacterial resistance.

AB  == cefepime is a new parenterally active fourth-generation cephalosporin which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. using the standard agar dilution method we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin against clinical isolates of escherichia coli (98 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (99 strains), acinetobacter spp. (24 strains), pseudomonas  aeruginosa (98 strains), haemophilus influenzae (108 strains), staphylococcus aureus (100 strains), enterococcus spp. (45 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (10 strains), streptococcus pyogenes (group a; 19 strains) and streptococcus agalactiae (group b; 36 strains). cefepime showed excellent activity against e. coli and k. pneumoniae, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 0.12 mg/l. the in vitro activity of cefepime was superior to or comparable to the third-generation  cephalosporins tested but was inferior to ciprofloxacin against acinetobacter spp. and p. aeruginosa. against h. influenzae, whether or not the strains produced beta-lactamase, its activity was similar to comparable drugs. all 84 isolates of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime whereas, like other cephalosporins, it had little activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. of the 45 enterococci isolates tested, 44.4% were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime. against streptococci, its activity was superior to any drug tested. this in vitro study indicates that cefepime has the  potential to be a valuable agent for the treatment of community- and hospital-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.

TI  == rabbit cap18 derived peptides inhibit gram negative and gram positive bacteria.
AB  == cap18 (cationic antimicrobial protein of 18 kda) was originally isolated from rabbit granulocytes using as an assay the agglutination of re-lipopolysaccharide  coated erythrocytes. the c-terminal 37 amino acids of cap18 comprise the lps-binding domain called rnip, reactive nitrogen inhibitory peptide. synthetic rnip has broad antimicrobial activity versus both gram positive [ic50 = 130-200 nm] and gram negative bacteria [ic50 = 20-100 nm). susceptible strains include staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and streptococcus pyogenes. antimicrobial activity is highly dependent upon peptide structure. although a 32  amino peptide resulting from truncation of five amino acids from the c terminus of rnip is highly active, other fragments of rnip including truncation of its n-terminus do not exhibit antimicrobial activity. unlike previously characterized antimicrobial peptides derived from granulocyte proteins rnip is active in serum. rnip or a derivative peptide may have therapeutic potential for bacterial sepsis.

TI  == toxic shock syndrome toxin-secreting staphylococcus aureus in kawasaki syndrome.
AB  == kawasaki syndrome (ks), the main cause of acquired heart disease in children, is  associated with the selective expansion of v beta 2+ t cells in peripheral blood. our study suggests that ks may be caused by a superantigen--a staphylococcal or streptococcal toxin. bacteria were cultured without knowledge of their origin, from the throat, rectum, axilla, and groin of 16 patients with untreated acute ks and 15 controls. bacteria producing toxins were isolated from 13 of 16 ks patients but from only 1 of 15 controls (p < 0.0001). toxic shock syndrome toxin  (tsst) secreting staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 11 of the 13 toxin-positive cultures, and streptococcal pyogenic exotoxin (spe) b and c were found in the other 2. these toxins are known to stimulate v beta 2+ t cells. all  tsst-producing ks isolates were tryptophan auxotrophs indicating they were clonally related. s aureus isolates from acute ks patients were unusual because they produced less lipase, haemolysin, and protease compared to other isolates (p < 0.01). s aureus colonies from ks patients were white, and could be easily mistaken for coagulase-negative staphylococci, whereas colonies of non-ks isolates were gold. these observations suggest that the expansion of v beta 2+ t  cells in most patients with ks may be caused by a new clone of tsst-producing s aureus, and, in a minority of patients, speb-producing or spec-producing streptococci.

TI  == [clinical evaluation of s-1108 in children].
AB  == a new oral cephem antibiotic, s-1108, was evaluated for its clinical efficacy and safety in children. s-1108 was effective in 95% of the 59 examined cases of respiratory, middle ear, skin and urinary tract infections. s-1108 was highly effective in infections of streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae and escherichia coli, but was less effective in penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus infections. the serum half-life was 1.26 +/- 0.36 hours upon after meal administration of 4 mg/kg. no severe adverse reaction  was encountered. from these data, s-1108 appears to be safe and effective in children with susceptible bacterial infections.

TI  == induction of the release of prostaglandin e2 from polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes by bacteroides fragilis: its possible role in the pathogenesis of mixed infections.
AB  == the presence of anaerobic bacteria, especially of bacteroides (b.) fragilis, in abdominal abscesses, infected decubitus ulcera, and the infected foot of diabetic patients is well documented. the importance, however, of these microorganisms in  the pathogenesis of deep tissue infections has still to be evaluated. therefore,  the aim of this study was to evaluate the potency of b. fragilis as compared to aerobic bacteria widely known for causing inflammation, in inducing the release of prostaglandin e2 from polymorphonuclear granulocytes. prostaglandin e2 is a potent vasodilator and contributes to edema and erythema, which are part of the inflammatory response. furthermore, the camp-content of the neutrophils was determined after stimulation of the cells with the various bacteria. of the bacterial species tested, b. fragilis proved to be one of the most potent triggers for prostaglandin e2 release from neutrophils indicating a possible major role of this microorganism in the pathogenesis of mixed infections.

TI  == toxic shock syndrome. are you recognizing its changing presentations?
AB  == nonmenstrual cases of toxic shock syndrome now occur at least as often as the classic menstrual cases. the syndrome has been reported in every conceivable clinical setting involving colonization or infection with staphylococcus aureus and as a complication of surgical procedures, traumatic injuries, and local infections. unusual clinical manifestations have been observed in patients with aids. cases of toxic shock syndrome also have been linked to infection with toxin-producing strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci and group a streptococci. knowledge of the expanding spectrum of toxic shock syndrome and early consideration of the disease in patients with fever, hypotension, rash, and/or multisystem disease are essential for timely diagnosis and optimum management.

TI  == cefepime: overview of activity in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == cefepime is a novel methoxyimino-aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a quaternized  n-methyl-pyrrolidine moiety at the 3' position conferring zwitterionic properties. because of this the molecule penetrates the outer cell membrane of gram-negative bacteria rapidly. in addition it is resistant to degradation by several plasmid and chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases, for which it also shows very low affinity and no inducing capacity. it has good affinity for pbps 2 and 3 of escherichia coli and for pbp 3 of pseudomonas aeruginosa. its broad-spectrum of activity includes gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. it is more active than cefotaxime or ceftazidime, against enterobacteriaceae. the mic90 for p. aeruginosa is higher than that of ceftazidime, but lower than those  of cefpirome, cefoperazone and latamoxef. other gram-negative organisms, haemophilus influenzae, neiserria meningitidis, neiserria gonorrhoeae, moraxella  catarrhalis are highly susceptible to cefepime. among gram-positive species methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, whether beta-lactamase producers or not, streptococcus pneumoniae  and streptococcus pyogenes are susceptible. cefepime is active against cefotaxime- and/or ceftazidime-resistant enterobacteriaceae. only strains of p. aeruginosa producing large amounts of beta-lactamase may be resistant to both ceftazidime and cefepime. in experimental infections such as meningitis, induced  with various bacterial species in neonatal rats and chronic staphylococcal osteomyelitis in rabbits, cefepime has shown good efficacy.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of dv-7751a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == we compared the in vitro antibacterial activity of dv-7751a against gram-positive and -negative bacteria with those of quinolones currently available. mics for 90% of the strains tested (mic90s) against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.20, 0.39, 0.20, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. moreover, mic50s for dv-7751a against ofloxacin-resistant methicillin-resistant s. aureus were 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-fold lower than those for tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. dv-7751a inhibited the growth of all strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and peptostreptococcus spp. at  0.39, 0.39, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively, and was 4- to > 16-fold more active against enterococci at the mic90 level than the other quinolones tested. the activity of dv-7751a against pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin at the mic90 level and was two- to fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin. dv-7751a showed activity comparable to  those of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against the other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and moraxella catarrhalis (mic90s of 0.025, 0.20, and 0.10 micrograms/ml, respectively). dv-7751a activity  was not affected by medium, inoculum size, or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions and in human urine, as were the other quinolones tested. time-kill curve studies demonstrated the rapid bactericidal action of dv-7751a against s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and p. aeruginosa. the frequency of spontaneous resistance to dv-7751a was less than or  equal to those of the reference drugs. dv-7751a inhibited the supercoiling activity of dna gyrases from s. aureus, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa at concentrations comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin.

TI  == the electrified drain. a new device for sterilizing the field of drainage.
AB  == a randomized control study was performed on 24 patients to evaluate the effect of a new drainage system. two types of drains were used: electrified and the conventional corrugated rubber drains. all of the 24 patients had an incisional hernia repair operation. in 12 patients, the wound was drained with an electrified drain (ed) and in the other 12 by the conventional drain (cd). the ed consisted of a corrugated rubber drain to which 2 silver-silver chloride electrodes were fixed. the wounds were drained for the first 3 post-operative days during which antibiotics were given. a peroperative and daily swab from the  wound was taken during the time of drainage and for 4 days thereafter, and cultured. for evaluation, a pathogen count of less than 10(5) colony-forming units per ml of discharge from wound cultures was considered as successful drainage, while counts above this level were defined as failures. drainage failure occurred in 4/12 patients (33%) of the cd group. pathogens encountered were streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus and albus and p. aeruginosa. manifestations of wound inflammation occurred in 2 of the 4 patients. the appropriate antibiotic was given to the 4 patients after culture and sensitivity  tests were performed. drainage failure did not occur in any of the ed group. post-operative laboratory assessment of blood count, liver and kidney functions and serum electrolytes recorded insignificant changes against preoperative values in both groups. the results demonstrate the superiority of the ed over the cd. the electric field produced by the ed seems to be lethal to organisms. the ed is  simple, safe and cost-effective.

TI  == effect of specific bacteria on lymphocyte proliferation in diseased and nondiseased tonsils.
AB  == tonsillar tissue lymphocyte (ttl) function as measured by lymphocyte proliferation was assessed in vitro in 38 tonsils--30 diseased and 8 normal controls. ttls from diseased and control tonsils were challenged with intact, heat-inactivated bacteria which may be found in the core of diseased tonsils; these bacteria were streptococcus pyogenes and hemophilus influenzae type b (hib), as well as the dominant bacterium (db) grown from that particular tonsillar core. the phytomitogen leukoagglutinin (la) was used as a nonspecific activator. lymphocyte proliferation was quantified and reported using a stimulation index (si) which was based upon viable cell counts at 2, 4, and 6 days following inoculation. overall, the greatest degree of lymphocyte proliferation in diseased ttls (si = .91) was produced by hib. however, both sp and hib produced more lymphocyte proliferation in the nondiseased ttls than in the diseased ttls (p < .01). h influenzae (non-b) and group a beta-hemolytic streptococci were the pathogens most frequently cultured as the dominant bacteria from the core of diseased tonsils; streptococcus viridans was most frequently cultured in nondiseased tonsils. the db caused greater ttl proliferation in diseased (si = .89) versus control (si = .63) ttls (p < .001). these findings suggest a differential proliferative response in vitro for diseased and nondiseased ttls in response to specific bacteria. the role of possibly pathogenic bacteria and commensals, as well as the implications for clinical disease, are discussed.

AB  == minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for sultamicillin (sbtpc), and for other major oral beta-lactam agents against clinically isolated  strains collected from outpatients during a period from august, 1992 to february, 1993, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. the ratio of penicillinase  (pcase)-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus was 96.0% and that of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) was 12.0%. mic90 of sbtpc against s. aureus including mrsa was 6.25 micrograms/ml. no increasing tendency was observed for s. aureus resistant to sbtpc. 2. no resistant strains were found among streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis against penicillins (pcs) including sbtpc. but pcs and cephems (ceps) insensitive or resistant streptococcus pneumoniae were observed in 22.0% among all the strains of s. pneumoniae. 3. 100% of the tested both strains of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis were beta-lactamase producers. 12.0% of the tested strains of haemophilus influenzae and 16.0% of the strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae were also beta-lactamase producers. sbtpc showed strong antimicrobial activity against most of these beta-lactamase producing strains. however, in our study of beta-lactamase productivity using plural substrates and test methods, it appeared that a part of strains of e. coli might produce beta-lactamase of "extended broad-spectrum". mics of sbtpc and ceps against those strains were distributed rather in a high range. 4. the results of the study suggested that the resistant  strains of s. pneumoniae against pcs and ceps might be increasing year by year. some of strains of e. coli, resistance against the 2 agents were observed. it is  important to keep observing changes in resistance of such organisms in the future. 5. the antimicrobial activities of sbtpc against clinically isolated strains in this study indicated potential problems such as those mentioned above. it is, however, also confirmed that sbtpc shows still strong antimicrobial activities against most of beta-lactamase producing strains found in daily medical examinations. taking into consideration of the strong activities of sbtpc against so-called indirect pathogenicity caused by beta-lactamase producing indigenous bacteria reported lately, sbtpc may be a useful antibiotic for community acquired infections in the 1990's.

TI  == review of in vitro activity, pharmacokinetic characteristics, safety, and clinical efficacy of cefprozil, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == objective: to review the pharmacokinetics, microbiology, clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerance of cefprozil, a new, broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin. data sources: published clinical trials and microbiologic, pharmacokinetic, and safety data were identified by medline; additional references were derived from bibliographies of these articles; microbiologic data on file were provided by bristol-myers squibb. study selection: only published comparative clinical trial  reports are included in the review of clinical efficacy. noncomparative clinical  data pertaining to uses of cefprozil not approved by the food and drug administration are not included. data synthesis: data are presented on the in vitro microbiologic activity of cefprozil against 10,152 bacterial isolates, including most of the clinically important streptococci (e.g., streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae), beta-lactamase-positive and -negative staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, clostridium difficile, and numerous other gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. in clinical trials, cefprozil appears to be  at least as effective as commonly used comparison agents such as cefaclor, cefixime, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. additionally, cefprozil is better tolerated than the latter two agents, especially with regard to gastrointestinal  adverse effects. conclusions: cefprozil is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin that provides coverage against both gram-negative and -positive bacteria that may cause otitis media, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, skin and skin-structure infections,  secondary bacterial infection of acute bronchitis, and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. the beta-lactamase stability of cefprozil appears to exceed that of other oral cephalosporins for some important pathogens. cefprozil is used primarily for second-line treatment as less-expensive, first-line generic alternatives generally are available. cefprozil demonstrates clinical advantages over many other orally administered beta-lactam antibiotics in terms of antimicrobial spectrum, a once- or twice-daily dosing regimen, and/or reduced incidence of adverse effects.

TI  == adult response to initial treatment with ampicillin in community acquired pneumonia in yaounde, cameroon.
AB  == a prospective study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of ampicillin as an initial therapy in 60 adult patients with community acquired pneumonia. bacteriological etiology was obtained only in 24 (40pc) patients by microscopic examination, culture and antigen detection. streptococcus pneumoniae was the leading causative agent identified in 15 cases. other etiologies were klebsiella  pneumoniae (3), streptococcus pyogenes (2) staphylococcus aureus (2), haemophilus influenzae (1) and moraxella catarrhails (1). patients were started on ampicillin one gram twice daily, empirically, and treated for 10 days. there were 52(86.7pc) patients cured, two(3.3pc) patients improved and six (10pc) were therapeutic failures. the causative agents in patients with failures were: klebsiella pneumoniae (1), staphylococcus aureus (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (1) and unknown in three cases. only six of 60 patients still febrile after three days were switched to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid or cefaclor according to culture results and susceptibilities or to roxythromycin because no organisms were isolated. side effects were observed in only one (1.7pc) patient who developed a  mild skin rash. due to its low cost and its high efficacy, ampicillin still appears to be the drug of choice in adult community acquired pneumonia in our region.

TI  == mutations affecting mhc class ii binding of the superantigen streptococcal erythrogenic toxin a.
AB  == streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin a (spea) is an important pathogenicity factor of group a streptococci. it is a member of the family of 'superantigens' produced by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, and its t lymphocyte stimulating activity is involved in the pathogenesis of certain diseases caused by pyogenic streptococci. in this study we have generated nine mutant spea molecules by substituting amino acids in the regions of homology between different streptococcal and staphylococcal superantigens. an additional mutant was created by deletion of the 10 n-terminal amino acids. the mutants were expressed as fusion proteins. several mutations led to a loss of function due to  a loss of class ii-binding activity. such loss mutations did not cluster to a certain region of the spea molecule. rather, even a substitution of neighboring amino acids had opposite effects. none of the loss mutations affected the binding of neutralizing mab and all loss mutants could be precipitated in ouchterlony tests by a polyclonal anti-spea serum. we conclude that the functional activities of spea, and probably of other superantigens as well, cannot be attributed to a defined region of the molecule.

TI  == a novel superantigen isolated from pathogenic strains of streptococcus pyogenes with aminoterminal homology to staphylococcal enterotoxins b and c.
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus) has re-emerged in recent years as  a cause of severe human disease. because extracellular products are involved in streptococcal pathogenesis, we explored the possibility that a disease isolate expresses an uncharacterized superantigen. we screened culture supernatants for superantigen activity with a major histocompatibility complex class ii-dependent  t cell proliferation assay. initial fractionation with red dye a chromatography indicated production of a class ii-dependent t cell mitogen by a toxic shock-like syndrome (tsls) strain. the amino terminus of the purified streptococcal superantigen was more homologous to the amino termini of staphylococcal enterotoxins b, c1, and c3 (seb, sec1, and sec3), than to those of pyrogenic exotoxins a, b, c or other streptococcal toxins. the molecule, designated ssa, had the same pattern of class ii isotype usage as seb in t cell proliferation assays. however, it differed in its pattern of human t cell activation, as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction with v beta-specific primers.  ssa activated human t cells that express v beta 1, 3, 15 with a minor increase of v beta 5.2-bearing cells, whereas seb activated v beta 3, 12, 15, and 17-bearing  t cells. immunoblot analysis of 75 disease isolates from several localities detected ssa production only in group a streptococci, and found that ssa is apparently confined to only three clonal lineages as defined by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis typing. isolates of one of these lineages, (electrophoretic type  2) are strongly associated with tsls. the data identify ssa as a novel streptococcal superantigen that appears to be more related structurally to staphylococcal enterotoxins than to streptococcal exotoxins. because abundant ssa production is apparently confined to only three streptococcal clonal lineages, the data also suggest that the ssa gene has only recently been acquired by s. pyogenes.

AB  == a patient with streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome (tsls) caused by streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus) is described. the patient had all of the defining criteria for toxic shock syndrome (tss), including fever, hypotension, erythematous rash, desquamation, and involvement of multiple organs. neither staphylococcus aureus nor group a streptococci were recovered, but vaginal and urine cultures yielded group b streptococci. the group b streptococcal isolate gave negative results in antibody tests for the production  of tss toxin 1, staphylococcal enterotoxins, and streptococcal scarlet fever toxins. however, the strain produced a novel pyrogenic toxin. this toxin, purified from culture fluids by ethanol precipitation, isoelectric focusing, and  reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, had a molecular weight of 12,000 and an isoelectric point of approximately 7.0. the purified toxin was pyrogenic in rabbits, enhanced the susceptibility of the animals to lethal endotoxin shock, and caused the proliferation of rabbit splenocytes; these properties define pyrogenic toxins. when given to three rabbits via a subcutaneous miniosmotic pump, the toxin caused tss-like symptoms ending in death. three additional group b streptococcal strains from patients with tsls were tested and were found to produce a toxin with similar properties.

TI  == antimicrobial therapy of skin and soft tissue infection in children.
AB  == skin and soft tissue infection and cutaneous abscesses are common in children. they may be polymicrobial in nature, especially when located proximal to mucous membranes. a general knowledge of the common causative bacterial organisms in these infections enables the physician to empirically institute antimicrobial therapy before culture results are available. this review assesses the number and types of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria that occur in skin and soft tissue infections in children. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes were recovered from infections occurring at all body sites, but predominated in infections of the leg, neck, and hand. group d streptococci, enterobacteriaceae,  neisseria gonorrhoeae, bacteroides fragilis, and prevotella species were isolated mostly from infections of the external genitalia and perirectal areas; pigmented  prevotella and porphyromonas and haemophilus influenzae can be isolated from infections of the head and neck. management of skin and soft tissue infections in children should include surgical and medical therapy.

TI  == post-antibiotic effects of ofloxacin on escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae,  staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == a viable counting technique was used to determine the post-antibiotic effect (pae) of ofloxacin against four bacterial species, treated with either once of four times the minimum inhibitory concentration for 1 or 3 h. similar to the results obtained previously with ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin gave pae values with escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pyogenes. cell division of klebsiella pneumoniae was inhibited on removal of ofloxacin, but no clear pae was demonstrated with this species because once replication recommenced, the mean generation times of drug-treated cultures were much shorter than those of untreated controls. therefore, although the results obtained with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin imply a consistency of pae for 4-quinolones within a  species, the response to dna damage induced by 4-quinolones is multifaceted and species dependent. 4-quinolones inhibit both dna replication and cell division, whilst at the same time stimulating dna repair pathways. thus, in some cases paes result from an increased post-treatment lag phase which may be followed by nearly normal multiplication, whereas in other cases a long lag may be followed by abnormally rapid cell division, with the generation times of treated cultures being shorter than those of corresponding drug-free controls. the pae of a drug-induced lag may thus be masked by rapid cell division once growth resumes.

TI  == selection of dose regimens of azithromycin .
AB  == the unique pharmacokinetics of azithromycin are characterized by high, sustained  tissue concentrations. the concentrations of azithromycin were predicted, following various multiple dose regimens, from concentrations in tonsillar, prostatic, and uterine tissues following single oral doses. following a five-day  treatment regimen (500 mg on day 1, followed by 250 mg on days 2-5), or a three-day regimen (500 mg daily for three days), concentrations of azithromycin in tonsillar tissue, representative of respiratory tract tissues, will continuously be greater than the mics for key target pathogens (streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus) in infections of the respiratory tract for up to 10 days. since tissue concentrations above the mics for infecting organisms were correlated with efficacy in animal models of infection, short treatment regimens consisting of once-daily oral administration  of azithromycin should be effective in the treatment of a variety of infections.  a single 1 g oral dose will provide concentrations in the uterus and prostate, representing urogenital tissues, above the mic for chlamydia trachomatis for approximately 10 days. thus, this regimen should be effective in the treatment of chlamydial infections of the genital tract.

TI  == comparison of azithromycin versus clarithromycin in the treatment of patients with upper respiratory tract infections.
AB  == the efficacy and safety of azithromycin and clarithromycin were compared in an open multicentre study involving 380 adult patients with acute otitis media, acute sinusitis, or acute streptococcal pharyngitis or tonsillitis. patients were assigned randomly to receive azithromycin as a single dose of 500 mg daily for three days, or clarithromycin 250 mg bid for ten days. overall clinical efficacy  was found to be similar in each treatment group at day 10-14, with a satisfactory outcome (cured or improved) in 95% of azithromycin and 96% of clarithromycin patients. bacteriological efficacy was also similar, with eradication of the pathogen in 94% and 95% of isolates, respectively, in the azithromycin and clarithromycin groups. in otitis media, a satisfactory clinical response was seen in 97% of patients in each treatment group. azithromycin therapy resulted in a clinical response rate of 93% in sinusitis patients, with bacteriological eradication in 93% of patients. two patients (who were cured clinically) had persistent pathogens. similarly, clarithromycin achieved clinical response and bacteriological eradication in 95% and 92% of sinusitis patients, respectively. pathogens persisted in two patients with clinical cure, and in one case of clinical failure. in pharyngitis or tonsillitis, streptococcus pyogenes was eradicated successfully in 95% of patients in both groups, and the clinical success rates were 96% and 97% for azithromycin and clarithromycin, respectively. no case of clinical failure was associated with persistence of s. pyogenes infection. at the follow-up assessment of this diagnosis group, reinfection had occurred in three (8%) azithromycin patients and one (3%) clarithromycin patient, and all but one patient remained asymptomatic. both drugs were well-tolerated, with 8.4% of patients on azithromycin and 7.4% on clarithromycin reporting adverse events, mainly gastrointestinal. it was concluded that a three-day course of azithromycin was as effective and well-tolerated as a ten-day course of clarithromycin in adults with acute upper respiratory tract infections.

TI  == a comparative study of the efficacy, safety and tolerance of azithromycin, dicloxacillin and flucloxacillin in the treatment of children with acute skin and skin-structure infections.
AB  == an open, randomized, multicentre study was undertaken to compare a three-day regimen of azithromycin with a seven-day course of dicloxacillin or flucloxacillin in the treatment of 118 children (aged 2-12 years) with clinically diagnosed acute skin and skin-structure infections. sixty patients received a single daily dose of azithromycin of 10 mg/kg for three days, whilst 58 received  a cloxacillin ester: either dicloxacillin (n = 49) at a daily dose of 12.5-25 mg/kg (depending on severity of infection); or flucloxacillin (n = 9) at 250-2000 mg/day (depending on age). both cloxacillin esters were administered in four divided doses for seven days. clinical, safety and, where possible, bacteriological assessments were made before therapy and after 3 to 5 and 7 to 10 days of treatment. a successful clinical response (cure and improvement) was recorded in 57 of 59 (97%) of evaluable azithromycin patients, and in 57 of 58 (98%) of cloxacillin ester patients. eradication of the key pathogens was 31 of 34 (91%) and 34 of 35 (97%) for staphylococcus aureus, and 5 of 5 and 4 of 4 for  streptococcus pyogenes in the azithromycin and cloxacillin ester groups, respectively. both medications were well tolerated, with mild to moderate side-effects (abdominal pain and vomiting) occurring in two patients in each group, and laboratory abnormalities (elevated eosinophil count) in one patient in each group. there were no withdrawals from therapy. the results of this study suggest that azithromycin is as effective and as well tolerated as a cloxacillin  ester antibiotic in the treatment of children with acute skin and skin-structure  infections.

AB  == this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  antibacterial agents at 149 hospitals throughout japan from september to december in both 1989 and 1990. in this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. the susceptibility testings were performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by nccls. staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci showed high or moderate resistance rates to beta-lactam antibiotics, but streptococcus pyogenes  and streptococcus pneumoniae were highly susceptible to them. enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to imipenem (ipm) and piperacillin but resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides. haemophilus influenzae, escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs and aminoglycosides. enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa had a good susceptibility to ipm and aminoglycosides. bacteroides fragilis was highly susceptible to ipm. ipm had strong antibacterial activity to many species of clinical isolates, including strains which were resistant to commonly used antibiotics.

AB  == antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin (cam) in comparison with other 6 macrolides was determined against 419 recent clinical isolates including streptococci, enterococci, staphylococci, moraxella, haemophilus and bacteroides  strains. mics80's of cam against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae were 0.78, 0.10 and 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. mics80's against moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae were 0.05 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. laboratory-induced resistance to cam in strains of s. pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis or methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus epidermidis occurred in stepwise fashion and at a very low rate. adherence to silicon filter of strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa or s. epidermidis was strongly repressed by the addition of sub-mic of cam or other macrolides. although tosufloxacin (tflx) alone had no bactericidal activity against the sessile cells of p. aeruginosa strains tested, tflx showed synergistic bactericidal activity when combined with sub-mics of cam or erythromycin.

TI  == monitoring of resistant organisms in man and identification of their origin.
AB  == information on the epidemiology of bacterial resistance is fragmentary despite an enormous number of publications since the introduction of antibiotics to human medicine, and remains a field of speculation mixed and influenced by fear of the  total collapse of antimicrobial chemotherapy by development of resistance (for review see wiedemann et al., 1986). bacteria have evolved mechanisms to withstand the attack of antibiotics and, in parallel, mechanisms for the spread of these characters to other bacteria by means of exchange of genetic information. however the development of resistance cannot be generalized. staphylococcus aureus gained penicillin resistance within a few years after the introduction of this drug, while streptococcus pyogenes remains 100% susceptible to penicillin, despite of the long use of penicillins in huge quantities. thus any statement about the development and epidemiology of resistance has to be addressed specifically to a  drug, a bacterial species, and a location. until now there is no identifiable general trend, which would allow us to deduce a general picture or a future development from a limited database. in this paper long term multicentre studies  are presented to demonstrate the area of concern for the treatment of human infections. in this context it is of specific interest to try and trace the origin of bacteria which cause infections in humans.

TI  == isolation of gram-positive rods that resemble but are clearly distinct from actinomyces pyogenes from mixed wound infections.
AB  == beginning in 1990, gram-positive rods resembling actinomyces pyogenes were found  with increasing frequency in mixed cultures from various infectious processes, most of them from patients with otitis, empyema, pilonidal cysts, perianal abscesses, and decubitus ulcers. ribotyping and hybridization showed that these gram-positive rods could be divided into five groups not related to known actinomyces species. biochemical markers for reliable differentiation into these  groups, however, could not be found. therefore, naming new species is not warranted unless parameters are discovered that allow identification without dna  hybridization. these gram-positive rods have been isolated only in mixed cultures with anaerobes, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus "milleri," enterococci, and  gram-negative rods. their exact role in these possibly synergistic infections needs further investigation.

TI  == superantigen can reactivate bacterial cell wall-induced arthritis.
AB  == intravenous injection of toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (tsst-1) produced by staphylococcus aureus, can reactivate arthritis in a rat ankle joint that has been previously inflamed by injection of peptidoglycanpolysaccharide polymers isolated from the cell walls of group a streptococci. the severity and chronicity of this renewed arthritis is dose dependent and at higher doses (125 micrograms/kg) a prolonged joint inflammation with pannus formation and marginal  erosion of cartilage and bone is induced after a single injection of tsst-1. only modest synovial hyperplasia is induced in control ankle joints by systemic injection of tsst-1. another superantigen, streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin induces a much weaker, acute reactivation of arthritis that resolves by 2 days. repeated injections of tsst-1 at 7-day intervals give the same undiminished pattern of joint response, but the joint swelling persists at a higher level with each succeeding injection. cyclosporin a suppresses all phases of the recurrent arthritis, indicating that tsst-1 could be functioning through its property of a  superantigen activating t lymphocytes. ii-1 receptor antagonist and anti-tnf-alpha neutralizing antibody, which reduce reactivation of arthritis by peptidoglycan-polysaccharide polymers, have no effect on reactivation by tsst-1.  this experimental model provides a means to examine in vivo the possible role of  superantigens in rheumatoid arthritis and related diseases, and to analyze the cellular and molecular pathways induced by this family of microbial products.

TI  == loracarbef. a review of its antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic efficacy.
AB  == loracarbef is an orally administered member of a new synthetic class of beta-lactam antibiotics, the carbacephems, which is characterised by enhanced chemical stability. at low concentrations (< 2 mg/l) in vitro, it inhibits streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, beta-haemolytic streptococci groups b, c and g. proteus mirabilis and moraxella catarrhalis, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. at therapeutic plasma concentrations it is also active in vitro against most strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. saprophyticus,  escherichia coli and beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains of haemophilus influenzae. like other beta-lactams, loracarbef is inactive against methicillin-resistant strains of s. aureus. when administered at dosages of 200 to 400 mg twice daily, the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of loracarbef is comparable with that of amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in patients with upper or lower respiratory tract infections, and comparable with that of cefaclor in treating infections of the lower respiratory tract, skin and skin structures and urinary tract. loracarbef and phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin  v) were equally effective in treating streptococcal pharyngitis and tonsillitis.  loracarbef is generally well tolerated by all age groups and causes less diarrhoea than amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. it is administered twice daily. it offers a suitable alternative to other orally administered antibiotics for the treatment of mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible organisms.

TI  == [superantigens and antigen recognition of t lymphocytes].
AB  == superantigens are antigens which can stimulate t cells bound to mhc molecules. the conventional foreign antigens are recognized by the t cell within the mhc peptide binding groove. superantigens differ from conventional antigens. they bind with high affinity to class ii mhc molecules outside the antigen binding groove in the absence of antigen processing. the mhc class ii/superantigen complexes on antigen presenting cells trigger the proliferation of t cells expressing the tcr-vb gene products. superantigens can amplify or suppress immune responses. to date, two main groups of superantigens have been described, namely  endogenous and exogenous superantigens. exogenous superantigens are microbial toxins and other protein products. endogenous superantigens are the products of unlinked genetic loci in mice the best known of which are the murine retroviral gene products. toxins of s. aureus and s. pyogenes are the best known exogenous superantigens, implicated in toxic shock syndrome.

AB  == streptococcal and staphylococcal toxins are responsible for skin-related clinical conditions, e.g. scarlet fever and toxic shock syndrome. skin involvement may result from a hypersensitivity reaction to these toxins; however, their precise mode of action has still to be elucidated. the aim of the present study was to investigate the capacity of human epidermal cells to present streptococcal erythrogenic toxin a (eta) or staphylococcal enterotoxin b (seb) to autologous t-lymphocytes in vitro. we found a significant t-lymphocyte proliferation response to minute amounts of eta (p < 0.01) and seb (p < 0.02) when co-cultured  with freshly isolated autologous human epidermal cells. we suggest that human skin may serve not only as an entry for microbial toxin-producing strains but also as an important target for streptococcal and staphylococcal toxin-binding and subsequent t cell proliferation.

TI  == staphylococcus aureus toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 and streptococcus pyogenes erythrogenic toxin a modulate inflammatory mediator release from human neutrophils.
AB  == we studied the influence of staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 and streptococcal erythrogenic (pyrogenic) toxin a (eta) on intact and digitonin-permeabilized human polymorphonuclear granulocytes (pmns). as was shown by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 or eta alone, in the absence of any additional stimulus, did not induce the generation of the chemoattractant leukotriene b4 (ltb4) from pmns in a wide range of concentrations. in addition, pretreatment of intact pmns with either toxin potentiated formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fmlp)- and washed staphylococcus aureus cell-induced generation of ltb4 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. this increase included ltb4 as well as its inactive omega-oxidated compounds. further studies revealed evidence that toxin exposure was accompanied by enhanced cellular receptor expression for fmlp as well as for  ltb4. the intrinsic gtpase activity of membrane fractions was modulated by both toxins. short-term incubation with eta increased the gtpase activity of pmns up to 141%. inhibitory effects were obtained when gtp-binding protein functions were stimulated with sodium fluoride (naf). in addition, specific binding of gpp(nh)p  to gtp-binding protein was inhibited by both toxins during the first 10 min of incubation and was restored at later times of incubation. our data therefore suggest that both toxins significantly affect the signal transduction pathways of human pmns, which results in immunomodulatory functions.

TI  == probable role of streptococcus pyogenes in kawasaki disease.
AB  == over the past 25 years, the clinical course of kawasaki disease has been defined, the prevalence and nature of the cardiovascular effects widely understood, and pathological changes in the most severe cases well described. however, the aetiology and pathogenesis of this puzzling disease have remained unclear, thus specific therapy is not yet available. because of some close clinical similarities between this disease and streptococcal scarlet fever, particular attention has been paid to the possible role of streptococcus pyogenes as an aetiological agent in this illness. until now, however, group a beta-haemolytic streptococci have never been consistently isolated from any patients; in addition, the titre of anti-streptolysin 0 is not raised, and lack of response to antibiotics is a feature of this disease. our long series of investigations over  more than 10 years, which will be covered in the present review, were performed in an attempt at elucidating causative agent(s) of kawasaki disease. this has led to our firm belief in the probable role of s. pyogenes in the pathogenesis of this disease, despite the lack of fulfillment of koch's postulates, on the basis  of the following findings. patients with kawasaki disease recovering from the acute, febrile phase of the illness exhibited an exaggerated cell-mediated reactivity, as measured by the macrophage migration inhibition test, to group a beta-haemolytic streptococci, their pyrogenic exotoxin and streptolysin 0 as well as to several mammalian muscle cell extracts which are allegedly related antigenically to the cell wall and/or cytoplasmic membrane of s. pyogenes. protoplast-like "spherical bodies" varying in diameter from 0.5 to 1.5 microns, and devoid of cell walls, were detected in the buffy coats of peripheral blood from patients with this disease, and stained distinctly by immuno-electron microscopy using, as a primary antibody, a rabbit antiserum to s. pyogenes- derived protoplasts, and followed by absorption with protoplasts from staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. newborn mice infected with s. pyogenes having no capacity to confer cell-mediated immunity even in adult murine hosts, and reinfected 4-6 weeks later with another strain of the same species of  bacteria which is able to elicit cellular immunity, showed a lack of humoral response to streptococcal antigens, leaving intact cell-mediated immunity. such a biased immunological characteristic is an exact counterpart of that of kawasaki disease patients.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == cefprozil. a review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties, and therapeutic potential.
AB  == cefprozil is an orally active cephalosporin which has demonstrated activity against a wide range of organisms in vitro. it is particularly active against the gram-positive organisms streptococcus pyogenes, pneumoniae and agalactiae and against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus. strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus are not susceptible to cefprozil. cefprozil is also moderately active against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, many enterobacteriaceae and certain anaerobic organisms, and is relatively stable to hydrolysis by a number of beta-lactamases. in comparative trials, the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of cefprozil 500mg  or 20 mg/kg administered once or twice daily has been comparable with multiple daily dosage regimens of erythromycin in patients with tonsillitis or pharyngitis, with cefaclor and amoxicillin/clavulanate in lower respiratory tract infections, with amoxicillin/clavulanate and erythromycin in skin and skin-structure infections and with cefaclor in acute uncomplicated urinary tract  infections. the clinical efficacy of cefprozil is similar to that of cefaclor in  patients with tonsillitis or pharyngitis but the bacteriological efficacy of cefprozil is significantly greater than that of cefaclor. cefprozil is clinically more effective than cefuroxime axetil in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections and demonstrated greater efficacy than cefaclor in one of 2 comparative studies when administered twice daily in patients with skin and skin-structure infections. in children with acute otitis media, cefprozil 15 mg/kg twice daily was as effective as cefaclor or amoxicillin/clavulanate 13.3 mg/kg 3 times daily and was as effective as cefixime 8 mg/kg once daily. the most frequently reported adverse effects associated with cefprozil, diarrhoea and nausea, are usually mild to moderate in severity and discontinuation of treatment is rarely necessary. thus, cefprozil with its convenient administration regimen appears to be a suitable alternative to cefaclor, cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate or erythromycin for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections, skin and skin-structure infections, and otitis media in children. while cefprozil has shown similar efficacy to cefaclor in the  treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, well-controlled clinical trials comparing its efficacy with that of cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim+sulfamethoxazole) in this indication are required.

AB  == seven clones of murine monoclonal antibodies specific for group-a streptococci were generated. all of them were of igm isotypes and recognized trypsinized as well as nontrypsinized group-a streptococci and polysaccharide. these were devoid of reactivity with streptococci-b, -c, -g and staphylococcus aureus. polyclonal antibodies against group-a polysaccharide (aps) were also raised in rabbits by linking aps to bovine serum albumin, and rendered monospecific by adsorption. latex agglutination assays were developed employing both types of antibodies. the assay employing monospecific polyvalent antibodies had a sensitivity of 12.5 ng aps/ml as compared to 1 microgram aps/ml for latex sensitized with monoclonal antibodies. both assays were specific, as no agglutination was observed with polysaccharides obtained from streptococci-b, -c, -g, staph. aureus, cornybacterium diptheriae, candida albicans, candida spp., morexella catarrhalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, strep. pneumoniae. salmonella typhi and s. paratyphi a and b. throat  swabs from children obtained in duplicate, when tested for the presence of streptococci-a, showed a good correlation of the results obtained by latex agglutination assay with the microbial culture test and serogrouping.

TI  == global surveillance of bacterial susceptibility to cefaclor: 1988-1990.
AB  == in vitro data on bacterial susceptibility to cefaclor were collected from clinical trials conducted in 15 european countries, south africa, canada, and the united states. among the respiratory pathogens, 94% of haemophilus influenzae, 98.6% of streptococcus pneumoniae, 98.8% of streptococcus pyogenes, and 98.1% of  moraxella catarrhalis were susceptible to cefaclor. over 90% of the tested isolates of the most common urinary tract pathogen, escherichia coli, were susceptible to cefaclor. virtually all of the pathogens that may infect skin and  soft tissues, s pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains), were cefaclor susceptible. these data confirm that the major pathogens  in bacterial infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract, of the skin and related structures, and of the urinary tract remain susceptible to cefaclor after more than 13 years of widespread clinical use.

TI  == comparative evaluation of cefadroxil and cephalexin in children and adolescents with pyodermas. cefadroxil once daily pyoderma study group.
AB  == this randomized, multicenter study compared the safety and efficacy of cefadroxil with that of cephalexin for the treatment of pyodermas in children and adolescents (1-18 years of age). cefadroxil was given as a single oral daily dose of 30 mg/kg, and cephalexin 30 mg/kg/day was given in two divided doses. the maximum daily dose for both drugs was 1 gm, and treatment was administered for 10 days. clinical and bacteriologic evaluations were made on days 4 or 5 during therapy and 2 to 4 days after therapy was completed. of the 462 patients enrolled in the study, 156 patients in the cefadroxil group and 133 patients in the cephalexin group were evaluable. staphylococcus aureus (56% of isolates) and streptococcus pyogenes (39% of isolates) were isolated most frequently. the bacteriologic response was statistically greater in the patients treated with cefadroxil than in those treated with cephalexin (96% versus 89%; p = 0.042). a satisfactory clinical response was reported in 147 (94%) cefadroxil-treated patients and 122 (92%) cephalexin-treated patients (p = 0.476). the overall effective response to treatment was significantly higher with cefadroxil than with cephalexin (94% versus 86%; p = 0.024). compliance with 9 or 10 days of therapy was similar in both treatment groups, although there was a difference between the two treatment groups with respect to completion of medication regimen: 95% of patients taking cefadroxil once daily--versus 65% of patients taking cephalexin twice daily--took 100% of their medication (p < 0.0001). adverse events were infrequent and mild. the results of this study demonstrate that once-daily cefadroxil offers greater bacteriologic eradication and a better  overall effective response than twice-daily cephalexin for the treatment of pyodermas caused by gram-positive pathogens in children and adolescents.

TI  == contributions of post-antibiotic lag and repair-recovery to the post-antibiotic effects of ciprofloxacin on escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == a viable counting technique was used to determine the post-antibiotic effect (pae) of ciprofloxacin against four bacterial species, treated with either one or four times the minimum inhibitory concentration for 1 or 3 h. pae were demonstrated with escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes after exposure to either concentration for both times. no clear pae was  demonstrated for klebsiella pneumoniae after any treatment. in some cases, pae was due to an increased post-treatment lag phase, which was followed by nearly normal multiplication, whereas in other cases a long lag was followed by abnormally rapid cell division, with the generation times of treated cultures being much less than those of the corresponding drug-free controls. this is evidence of recovery of cells that have completed dna repair. s. aureus, e. coli  and k. pneumoniae all exhibited evidence of this type of repair even though k. pneumoniae gave no significant pae. however, the post-treatment generation times  of s. pyogenes, which produced the greatest pae, gave no evidence of such repair. it is concluded that paes may result from a variety of factors.

TI  == review of cefixime in the treatment of otitis media in infants and children.
AB  == during the past decade there has been an increase in the percentage of resistant  bacteria isolated from middle-ear effusions aspirated from infants and children who have had acute otitis media. at least nine oral antibiotics or combination agents are available for this indication. cefixime, a third generation cephalosporin, has excellent in vitro activity against both beta-lactamase-negative and beta-lactamase-positive haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, good activity against streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes but relatively poor activity against staphylococcus aureus. in children cefixime is similar in effectiveness to amoxicillin and cefaclor, but diarrhea and stool changes are more common with cefixime. amoxicillin is still preferred for initial empiric treatment of uncomplicated acute otitis media. its major drawback is limited efficacy when beta-lactamase-producing bacteria are the causative organisms. cefixime is a viable alternative to amoxicillin for infants and children with acute otitis media when: (1) a beta-lactamase-producing h. influenzae or m. catarrhalis is isolated from otorrhea or tympanocentesis; (2) the child has a history of delayed hypersensitivity to the penicillins but no history of hypersensitivity to the cephalosporins; (3) there is a high incidence of resistant bacteria in the community; (4) there is not clinical improvement with amoxicillin; or (5) once daily administration is more convenient.

TI  == microbiologic and clinical aspects of a trial of once daily cefixime compared with twice daily cefaclor for treatment of acute otitis media in infants and children.
AB  == in this randomized, investigator-blinded multicenter study, tympanocentesis for acute otitis media with effusion in 137 ears from 108 children, 6 months to 12 years of age, revealed 84 definite pathogens and 32 potential pathogens. twenty-nine aspirates from 23 subjects were sterile. of the 116 isolates 42 (36%) were streptococcus pneumoniae, 24 (21%) were haemophilus influenzae, 9 (8%) were  moraxella catarrhalis, 9 (8%) were streptococcus pyogenes and 1 (1%) was staphylococcus aureus. twenty-two (19%) definite pathogens produced beta-lactamase. patients were randomized to cefixime (8 mg/kg/day daily) or cefaclor (40 mg/kg/day divided into two doses). efficacy was determined by pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry at the end of therapy visit on days 11 to 14  and up to 4 weeks of follow-up. at end of therapy subjects with definite pathogens exhibited a satisfactory clinical outcome in 26 of 36 (72%) ears for cefaclor and 40 of 48 (83%) ears for cefixime recipients (p = 0.12). for ears with beta-lactamase-producing isolates there were no (0 to 12) cefixime failures  but 4 of 10 cefaclor failures (p = 0.03). diarrhea/loose stools were more frequent in cefixime (16 of 58) than cefaclor (4 of 50) recipients. one cefixime  subject required discontinuation of drug. overall efficacy for treatment of acute otitis media with effusion was not different; however, cefixime appeared more effective for infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing organisms.

TI  == comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
AB  == an agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, shigella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, and haemophilus influenzae with an mic90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, and legionella pneumophila with an mic of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. ciprofloxacin inhibited staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. norfloxacin  and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (mic90) against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and some other gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. the results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against gram-negative and gram-positive species.

TI  == role of serum antibodies to streptococci in patients with iga nephropathy.
AB  == serum antibodies to whole cells of streptococci and serum immune complexes were investigated in patients with iga nephropathy accompanied by tonsillitis and in healthy adult controls by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). serum iga levels to streptococcus salivarius, s. sanguis i and s. pneumoniae were higher in patients with iga nephropathy than in healthy controls. the levels of igg to s. pyogenes t12, s. gordonii and s. sanguis ii in patients with iga nephropathy were also higher than in healthy controls. serum immune complexes of igg and iga were  higher in patients with iga nephropathy than in healthy controls. serum levels of iga to some strains of streptococci tended to correlate with the level of iga immune complex in both patients and healthy controls. these results suggest that  antibodies to some strains of streptococci play a role in the pathogenesis of iga nephropathy.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of rokitamycin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == we obtained bacterial strains which were clinically isolated and identified from  outpatients with various infections in medical institutions throughout japan. possible antibacterial activities of rokitamycin (rkm) were examined against these isolates. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined through  a comparative study with reference drugs. the results of the study are summarized as follows. 1. resistance patterns of 400 isolates which were highly resistant to macrolides (mls) with mic values > 100 micrograms/ml were classified into 55 patterns. staphylococcus spp. showed cross resistance to 14-membered ring mls with 100% cross resistance observed between erythromycin (em) and clarithromycin  (cam), and 85.2% between em and oleandomycin (ol). fewer isolates showed strong resistance to 16-membered ring mls than to 14-membered ring mls. cross resistances observed among the staphylococcus isolates were 100% between acetylmidecamycin (mdm-ac) and kitasamycin (leucomycin (lm)), 93.9% between mdm-ac and josamycin (jm), and 53.3% between mdm-ac and rkm. streptococcus spp. and peptococcus spp. showed very similar resistance patterns to both 14- and 16-membered ring mls, but resistance patterns to rkm were quite different. most of anaerobic streptococci and bacteroides fragilis group had similar resistance patterns to 14- and 16-membered ring mls, but in some cases a pattern similar to  that of staphylococcus spp. was observed. 2. when ml-resistant bacteria isolated  during 1975 to 1980 were compared to those isolated in 1986 and 1989, it was observed that resistance of staphylococcus aureus remained almost unchanged, that of streptococcus pyogenes was lower in the later years than during 1975 to 1980,  but that of streptococcus pneumoniae increased. 3. most of ml-resistances of the  resistant isolates were inducible, but extents of induction varied depending on drugs tested. strong inductions were observed when 14-membered ring mls were used, but inductions were minimal with 16-membered ring mls. rkm appeared to induce resistance to the least extent. from these results, it appears that the rkm is quite useful clinically even in the 1990s.

AB  == antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (caz) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout japan in 1989 and 1991. those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic90 of caz in 1991 were markedly higher against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. also, among other bacteria such as providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, xanthomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to caz were observed in high proportions. however, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of caz on streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella spp, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, haemophilus influenzae and anaerobic gpc (gram-positive cocci). 2. among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant gram-negative bacilli of enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. it appears therefore, that caz failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these  strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. antimicrobial activities of caz on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. however, it was also demonstrated that caz maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. when it is additionally taken into account that caz is one of those limited drugs with activity against p. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that caz still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.

TI  == pyomyositis in north america: case reports and review.
AB  == we report two cases and review the characteristics of pyomyositis. the courses of patients who presented with pyomyositis at the maricopa medical center (phoenix)  are detailed. ninety-eight reported cases over the last 20 years in north america, found through a medline search, are summarized. infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) may predispose the patient to pyomyositis. the onset is usually insidious with progression to large purulent collections and significant morbidity. the diagnosis is frequently suggested by findings of imaging studies. staphylococcus aureus is responsible for most cases in tropical  areas but is less frequently associated with cases in north america. since infection with hiv predisposes patients to bacterial infections, pyomyositis will occur more frequently in this patient population. increased awareness of the disease will improve management. following aspiration or surgical drainage, therapy with broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics may be considered initially in  the treatment of pyomyositis.

TI  == macrophage response to bacteria: induction of marked secretory and cellular activities by lipoteichoic acids.
AB  == lipoteichoic acids (ltas) from various bacterial species, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and listeria monocytogenes, were examined for the ability  to induce secretory and cellular responses in a pure population of bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes. some of the highly purified ltas, in particular ltas from bacillus subtilis, s. pyogenes, e. faecalis, and enterococcus hirae, were able to affect each of the macrophage parameters measured, i.e., reductive capacity, secretion of tumor necrosis factor and nitrite, and tumoricidal activity. as after stimulation with whole organisms or other bacterial products, secretion of tumor necrosis factor induced by these ltas reached its maximum within the first few hours of the interaction, while secretion of nitrite and tumoricidal activity required 24 to 36 h for full expression. other purified ltas, i.e., ltas from streptococcus sanguis, s. pneumoniae, and l. monocytogenes, as well as lipomannan from micrococcus luteus affected only some of these parameters, while native lta from s. aureus was inactive. there was no obvious correlation between biological activity and chain  length, kind of glycosyl substituents, glycolipid structures, or fatty acid composition of ltas. deacylation of ltas resulted in a complete loss of activity, and deacylated ltas did not impair the activity of their acylated counterparts, suggesting that acyl chains may be essential for binding of lta to the cell surface. the results demonstrate that some lta species are potent inducers of macrophage secretory and cellular activities.

TI  == antibacterial profile of flurithromycin, a new macrolide.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of flurithromycin against common respiratory tract gram-positive (85 strains) and gram-negative (44 strains) pathogens, and a collection of anaerobes (125 strains) was compared with that of erythromycin, cefixime, amoxycillin, co-amoxiclav, ciprofloxacin, netilmicin and clindamycin. flurithromycin possessed the same spectrum and potency of antimicrobial activity  as erythromycin. the presence of 50% human serum in the test media enhanced the activity of flurithromycin against all isolates, with the exception of streptococcus pyogenes. flurithromycin induced a post-antibiotic effect (pae) that ranged from 0.25 h (haemophilus influenzae) to 3.5 h (streptococcus pneumoniae) for all strains tested. the presence of serum increased or diminished the duration of the pae, depending on the strain being analysed. no interaction between flurithromycin and the other drugs tested was observed by the checkerboard technique, but when the time-kill system was used, 35 cases of synergy were noted out of 120 tests performed (29%), of which 15 (43%) were with  moraxella catarrhalis, 12 (34%) with staphylococcus aureus, four (11%) with h. influenzae and the remainder with s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. netilmicin produced most synergic interactions. antagonism was not detected by either methods.

TI  == in-vitro stimulation of tnf-alpha from human whole blood by cell-free supernatants of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == gram-positive bacteria are being recognized increasingly as the cause of shock-like syndromes, clinically indistinguishable from those seen in association with gram-negative endotoxic shock. much clinical and experimental data link tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) with the pathogenesis of endotoxic shock, and a number of studies of individual gram-positive species have also implicated tnf-alpha. we report here the first systematic study of the ability of cell-free supernatants of common gram-positive bacteria to induce tnf-alpha from  human peripheral blood monocytes in vitro. almost all the 63 strains were able to induce tnf-alpha, although the levels were substantially lower than those obtained from supernatants of gram-negative bacteria, used as controls. streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, viridans streptococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci were consistently more active than group b and d streptococci. tnf-alpha induction did not correlate with conventional markers of  pathogenicity; amongst strains of staphylococcus aureus, commensal and blood culture isolates did not induce significantly different amounts of tnf. we conclude that cell-free supernatants of most gram-positive bacteria are capable of inducing tnf-alpha from human peripheral blood monocytes in vitro, but the significance of this finding remains to be determined.

TI  == fibronectin-binding protein of streptococcus pyogenes: sequence of the binding domain involved in adherence of streptococci to epithelial cells.
AB  == the sequence of the fibronectin-binding domain of the fibronectin-binding protein of streptococcus pyogenes (sfb protein) was determined, and its role in streptococcal adherence was investigated by use of an sfb fusion protein in adherence studies. a 1-kb dna fragment coding for the binding domain of sfb protein was cloned into the expression vector pex31 to produce an sfb fusion protein consisting of the n-terminal part of ms2 polymerase and a c-terminal fragment of the streptococcal protein. induction of the vector promoter resulted  in hyperexpression of fibronectin-binding fusion protein in the cytoplasm of the  recombinant escherichia coli cells. sequence determination of the cloned 1-kb fragment revealed an in-frame reading frame for a 268-amino-acid peptide composed of a 37-amino-acid sequence which is completely repeated three times and incompletely repeated a fourth time. cloning of one repeat into pex31 resulted in expression of small fusion peptides that show fibronectin-binding activity, indicating that one repeat contains at least one binding domain. each repeat exhibits two charged domains and shows high homology with the 38-amino-acid d3 repeat of the fibronectin-binding protein of staphylococcus aureus. sequence comparison with other streptococcal ligand-binding surface proteins, including m  protein, failed to reveal significant homology, which suggests that sfb protein represents a novel type of functional protein in s. pyogenes. the sfb fusion protein isolated from the cytoplasm of recombinant cells was purified by fast protein liquid chromatography. it showed a strong competitive inhibition of fibronectin binding to s. pyogenes and of the adherence of bacteria to cultured epithelial cells. in contrast, purified streptococcal lipoteichoic acid showed only a weak inhibition of fibronectin binding and streptococcal adherence. these  results demonstrate that sfb protein is directly involved in the fibronectin-mediated adherence of s. pyogenes to epithelial cells.

TI  == superantigens, t cells, and microbes.
AB  == it is well recognized that toxins of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes are responsible for a wide range of clinical conditions, although their  precise mode of action remains unclear. recently, there has been a resurgence of  interest in these toxins, now grouped with superantigens, because they cause profound alterations in the immune system homeostasis. superantigens are molecules, including endogenous retroviral gene products and microbial toxins, that share a unique set of characteristics. they bind with high affinity to major histocompatibility complex class ii at regions distinct from the conventional antigen binding groove and cause prolific activation or anergy of t cells with certain t cell receptor variable-region gene families. whilst most of the superantigens described to date are products of bacteria or viruses, the presence of superantigens in parasites and their role in disease pathogenesis remain to be defined. it is probable that associations are present between superantigen-induced proliferation or anergy of peripheral blood t cells and clinical manifestations of human infectious diseases. the identification of these may pave the way toward a better understanding of disease pathogenesis and the possible development of newer immunotherapeutic regimes. this review summarizes the current thinking on microbial superantigens, their association with human t cells, and speculations about their significance.

TI  == murine model of cutaneous infection with gram-positive cocci.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus has remained an important cause of nosocomial wound infections, but standardized or reproducible systems for analyzing cutaneous infections caused by s. aureus do not exist. a variety of foreign materials, variable inocula, and skin traumas have been used to promote infection. to minimize these variables and ensure reproducibility, we chose a model using subcutaneous injections of a fixed quantity of dextran microbeads (cytodex) as the foreign material added to standardized broth suspensions of s. aureus. suspensions (0.2 ml) injected into an outbred strain of immunocompetent hairless  mice generated reproducible, measurable lesions. with s. aureus smith diffuse, fluctuant, erythematous lesions with a peak diameter of 15 mm were observed; these lesions yielded purulent material containing gram-positive cocci and neutrophils and yielded growth of s. aureus on culture. lesion size was proportional to the bacterial inoculum size. histologic examination of excised lesions revealed typical abscesses. a second strain of s. aureus (slc3) produced  dermonecrosis instead of abscesses at an inoculum size of 10(7) cfu. control injections with a sterile cytodex suspension regularly produced nondraining, nonerythematous nodules with maximum diameters of less than or equal to 5 mm. streptococcus pyogenes produced late-onset necrotic lesions and abscesses. using  a foreign substance, this model generates easily observed and reproducible cutaneous infection with s. aureus and streptococci that can potentially discriminate between inter- and intrastrain differences. such a model could be used to test the pathogenicity of isogeneic strains of these bacterial species and to evaluate the efficacy of antimicrobial agents.

AB  == antibiotic activities (mics) of ceftriaxone (ctrx) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of  other cephems. 1. when compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated mic90s of ctrx: staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and providencia spp. no changes were observed in mic90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and peptostreptococcus spp. 2. the mic90 of ctrx to s. pneumoniae was high because a  large number of benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp) was present among this species. the mic80 to bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. other oxime-type cephems also had high mics against the above mentioned bacteria. therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as ctrx against pisp and b. fragilis group. 3. sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), cephamycin-resistant  as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. some of there resistant bacteria  are also ctrx-resistant, and ctrx had insufficient activities against them. 4. with regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with ctrx-resistance from year to year,  the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989  and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. it appears that those strains resistant to cephems including ctrx are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. ctrx, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. furthermore, considering that ctrx is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that ctrx is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.

TI  == a comparison of two commercially irradiated trypticase soy agars containing lecithin and polysorbate 80.
AB  == gamma-radiation sterilized trypticase soy agar containing lecithin and polysorbate 80 (tsa++) (becton dickinson microbiology systems, cockeysville, md)  and irradiated tsa++ (adams scientific, west warwick, ri) were tested by a quantitative spread plate method. four bacteria bacillus subtilis atcc 6633, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 10145, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, streptococcus pyogenes atcc 19615 and the yeast candida albicans atcc 10231 were  tested in two separate experiments using different lots of media. a strain of aspergillus niger atcc 16404, was tested by a qualitative streak plate method. the becton dickinson microbiology systems (bdms) irradiated tsa++ overall recovered a greater number of organisms than the adams scientific tsa++ in both experiments and allowed for the earlier recovery of s. pyogenes atcc 19615. the growth of a. niger atcc 16404, was comparable on both media. efficacy of the media to neutralize 1, 2 and 3% phenol as well as 0.001, 0.01 and 0.1% benzalkonium chloride (bc) solutions was done by a disk diffusion method using 2  gram-positive and 4 gram-negative bacteria. both media showed complete neutralization of the 0.001 and 0.01% bc solutions and partial neutralization of  the 0.1% bc solution. the bdms tsa++ showed better neutralization of the 2 and 3% phenol solutions than the adams scientific tsa++. this data indicates that not all irradiated tsa++ media perform in an equivalent manner.

TI  == in-vitro activity of rp 59500, a semisynthetic streptogramin, against staphylococci and streptococci.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of rp 59500, an injectable streptogramin derived from pristinamycin, was determined by agar dilution and compared with that of pristinamycin. two hundred and sixty-one recent clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci were tested against both antibiotics. the two compounds displayed similar activities. the mic90s of rp 59500 ranged from 0.5 to 2 mg/l in 114 strains of staphylococcus aureus showing various phenotypes of antibiotic resistance (penicillin-susceptible; penicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible; methicillin-resistant; erythromycin-resistant, either inducible or constitutive; quinolone-resistant). similar results were obtained with coagulase-negative staphylococci. rp 59500 was consistently active against streptococci, with mic90s of 0.25, 0.25 and 0.50 mg/l for streptococcus pyogenes  (n = 20), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 20) and streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 20), respectively. enterococcus faecalis (n = 20) appeared to be notably less susceptible (mic90, 8 mg/l). in view of this consistent activity against all staphylococci and streptococci tested, including multiply resistant isolates, rp  59500 merits further investigation.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of ru29246, the active metabolite of hr916b.
AB  == hr 916b is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. in tests its active metabolite, ru29246, inhibited streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the antibacterial activity of cefuroxime, and was more active than cefaclor. it was also more active (mic 2 micrograms/ml) than cefixime, cefuroxime, cefaclor and cefotaxime against staphylococci. ru29246 inhibited escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii and salmonella spp. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, thus being more active than cefuroxime and cefaclor,  but was less active than cefixime and cefotaxime. it did not inhibit pseudomonas  aeruginosa and other pseudomonas spp., enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens or  bacteroides fragilis. ru29246 was not hydrolyzed by tem-1, staphylococcus aureus  tem-2 or moraxella catarrhalis beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by tem-3 and the chromosomal beta-lactamases of proteus vulgaris and morganella morganii. plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases were inhibited by ru29246.

TI  == post-antibiotic effect of the new streptogramin rp 59500.
AB  == the post-antibiotic effect (pae) of rp 59500, a new streptogramin antibiotic, was determined for staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus  haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes. a 30 min exposure of staphylococcus aureus to 5 micrograms/ml of rp 59500 produced a pae of 1.9-6.9 h, and a 60 min exposure of 2.5 micrograms/ml produced a pae of 3.2-8  h. a 30 min exposure of 5 micrograms/ml of rp 59500 of coagulase-negative staphylococci produced a pae of 2.5-7.5 h. paes of constitutively erythromycin-resistant staphylococcal isolates were shorter than were the paes of highly susceptible isolates. a 30 min exposure to 5 micrograms/ml of rp 59500 produced a pae of 7.5-9.5 h for streptococcus pneumoniae and a pae of greater than 18 h for streptococcus pyogenes. rp 59500 produced a longer pae with staphylococcus aureus than did vancomycin, oxacillin or erythromycin. these results suggest that rp 59500 may be administered less frequently than would be suggested by its half-life.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of new streptogramins, rp 59500, rp 57669 and rp 54476, alone and in combination.
AB  == rp 59500 is a 30:70 mixture of rp 57669 and rp 54476. the activity of rp 59500 and its two components against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was compared with that of clarithromycin, roxithromycin, azithromycin and rokitamycin. rp 59500 inhibited 90% of erythromycin-susceptible and resistant staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at less than or equal  to 1 mg/l (range 0.06-2 mg/l). both inducibly and constitutively-resistant strains of s. aureus, as well as strains resistant to rifampicin, gentamicin and  ciprofloxacin, were inhibited. streptococcus pyogenes, including erythromycin-resistant isolates, and group c and g streptococci were inhibited by 0.5 mg/l. streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci were inhibited by 1 mg/l. the mic90 was 4 mg/l for haemophilus influenzae and 1 mg/l for moraxella catarrhalis. rp 59500 did not inhibit enterobacteriaceae or pseudomonas aeruginosa. the activity of rp 59500 against streptococci was less than that of the four other macrolides. clostridium perfringens strains were highly susceptible, as were bacteroides spp. rp 59500, when combined with ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime or gentamicin, did not have altered activity against susceptible species or alter the activity of the other component of the combination against susceptible species. mbcs in serum were increased two- to four-fold for s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae and s. aureus, compared with mbcs in broth, but rp 59500  was as active at ph 6 as at ph 7, and there was not an appreciable inoculum effect. rp 59500 has potential use as an agent against inducibly and constitutively erythromycin-resistant isolates of gram-positive species and selected anaerobic organisms.

AB  == staphylococcus aureus and group a streptococcus pyogenes produce toxic shock syndrome characterized by hypotension and multisystem organ failure. while conventional therapy has consisted of antibiotics and intensive supportive care,  some experimental evidence suggests that immunoglobulins directed against the toxins may be effective additional therapy. we report a case of "toxic strep syndrome" in which intravenous immunoglobulin was administered when signs and symptoms were worsening while the patient was receiving conventional therapy. within hours of administration of the intravenous immunoglobulin, the patient experienced dramatic clinical improvement. this response suggests a possible therapeutic benefit of intravenous immunoglobulin in toxic shock syndrome.

TI  == in vitro activity of loracarbef and effects of susceptibility test methods.
AB  == loracarbef is a new oral antimicrobial of the carbacephem class with in vitro activity against the common pathogens associated with skin infections, otitis media, sinusitis, bronchopulmonary infections, and urinary tract infections. a review of the literature shows the following ranges for 90% minimum inhibitory concentration (mic90) values (microgram/ml) against the organisms that commonly cause these illnesses: streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.25-2.0; moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive), 0.5-8.0; m. catarrhalis (beta-lactamase negative), 0.12-0.25; haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive), 0.5-16.0; h. influenzae (beta-lactamase negative), 0.25-8.0; escherichia coli, 2.0-25; klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.25-8.0; proteus mirabilis, 1.0-8.0; streptococcus pyogenes, less than or equal to 0.06-1.0; staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase positive), 8.0; s. aureus (beta-lactamase negative), 1.0-2.0. the in vitro activity of loracarbef against these common outpatient pathogens is similar to that of other oral antimicrobials such as cefaclor, cefuroxime axetil, cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. the results of in vitro susceptibility tests with  any antimicrobial, including loracarbef, are somewhat dependent on the specific test method that is employed in the laboratory. this is particularly true with h. influenzae. furthermore, the results of loracarbef susceptibility tests are of uncertain value in predicting therapeutic outcome.

TI  == treatment of pharyngitis and tonsillitis with cefprozil: review of three multicenter trials.
AB  == cefprozil is a new oral cephalosporin with an in vitro spectrum of activity that  includes group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes). three multicenter, randomized trials were conducted for comparing the clinical efficacy and safety of cefprozil administered once or twice daily with that of cefaclor, penicillin, or erythromycin ethylsuccinate administered three or four times daily in the treatment of mild-to-moderate tonsillopharyngitis. in the cefprozil-cefaclor trial, the pathogen eradication rate for evaluable patients receiving cefprozil was 83%, which was significantly better than that for patients receiving cefaclor (76%) (p = .035). the rate of satisfactory clinical response was similar with cefprozil (89%) and cefaclor (84%). the overall response rate was significantly better with cefprozil (80%) than with cefaclor (72%, p = .018). differences in response rates were not noted when analyzing only patients 2-12 years of age. in the cefprozil-penicillin trial, the eradication rate of bacteriologic pathogens was similar in patients receiving cefprozil (91%) and in patients receiving penicillin (87%). a satisfactory clinical response was  seen in 95% of the evaluable cefprozil-treated patients, which was significantly  better than the rate of satisfactory clinical response seen in the penicillin-treated patients (88%; p = .023). in addition, during-therapy cultures for penicillin-treated patients yielded a significantly higher rate of beta-lactamase-producing staphylococcus aureus than did those for the group of cefprozil-treated patients (13% vs. 4.5%, respectively; p = .046). significantly  more clinically symptomatic bacteriologic failures occurred in the penicillin group (p = .037).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the characterization of two new low molecular weight proteins (lmps) from streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == two novel extracellular mitogenic substances were isolated from streptococcus pyogenes strain ny-5 and characterized. the purification steps involved an initial enrichment of the proteins from culture supernatant by silica gel adsorption, followed by ion exchange chromatography and gel filtration. the purified materials were homogeneous in sds-page, showed estimated molecular weights of 12 kd and isoelectric points of 4.7 and 4.3, respectively. both proteins (lmp-12k-4.3pi and lmp-12k-4.7pi) demonstrated lymphocyte transformation activity at a concentration of 0.1 microgram/ml. the lmp-12k-4.7pi showed a 69.2% homology of the amino acid sequence with that of a phosphocarrier protein of staphylococcus aureus and with a total identity in the active centre. the same protein was also isolated from streptococcal group c strain h46a with an n-terminal amino acid sequence being identical. the lmp-12k-4.7pi demonstrated biochemical properties identical with those of the earlier described streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin type d. the lmp-12k-4.3pi did not show such a clear relation to other functional proteins.

TI  == the effect of roxithromycin on the virulence of gram-positive cocci.
AB  == antibiotics whose recognized mode of action comprises inhibition of bacterial protein biosynthesis are also recognized to modulate the expression of bacterial  virulence factors when incorporated into culture media at sub-mic levels. in this respect, one of the new macrolides, roxithromycin, has been examined for its effect on toxin/enzyme production by strains of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae. biosynthesis of staphylococcal coagulase and dnase could be potentiated, whereas that of staphylococcal alpha-hemolysin, streptolysins o and s, and pneumolysin were unaltered. expression of one structural virulence factor, pneumococcal polysaccharide, was repressed in the drug's presence, resulting in potentiation of phagocytic ingestion of the drug-exposed bacteria. the drug failed to have any effect on ingestion of staph. aureus or strep. pyogenes. these studies provide evidence that roxithromycin may exhibit "added value" as an antibiotic in its ability to potentiate the susceptibility of strep. pneumoniae to host defenses such as phagocytosis.

TI  == infected aortic aneurysms. a changing entity.
AB  == infected (mycotic) aortic aneurysms are infrequent and, without surgical intervention, usually lead to uncontrolled sepsis or catastrophic hemorrhage. symptoms are frequently absent or non-specific during the early stages, and a high index of suspicion is essential to make the diagnosis. surgery performed after rupture carries high morbidity and mortality rates. bacterial endocarditis  with streptococcus pyogenes was the most common cause of infected aortic aneurysm in the pre-antibiotic era. today, arterial trauma due to iatrogenic manipulation  and depressed immunocompetence have become more common risk factors. staphylococcus aureus and salmonella are the most frequent bacteria identified. the authors' recent experience in six patients with infected aortic aneurysms who underwent arteriography and computed tomography was reviewed and these diagnostic methods compared. computed tomography was found to be more sensitive in the diagnosis of the early stages of the disease, allowing for follow-up by serial scans in a noninvasive and less costly manner. successful treatment, in four of these patients, was accomplished by aneurysmal resection and extra-anatomic bypass or in situ prosthetic reconstruction. a higher clinical awareness of this  disease, leading to early computed tomography evaluation and prompt surgical intervention under appropriate and intensive antibiotic therapy, appears to offer the best chance of survival in patients with this difficult condition.

AB  == in a randomized crossover trial, six volunteers received 200- and 400-mg doses of loracarbef (ly 163892), a new oral cephalosporin. mean +/- standard error of the  mean concentrations in serum obtained after 1.5 and 3 h were 13.2 +/- 2.8 and 4.3 +/- 0.7 mg/liter, respectively, after the 400-mg dose and 6.9 +/- 1.0 and 1.7 +/- 0.2 mg/liter, respectively, after the 200-mg dose. bactericidal reciprocal titers measured against respiratory pathogens in serum suggested that loracarbef would be highly effective against streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes (median titers, 8 to 128 at 1.5 h and less than 2 to 32 at 3 h) and beta-lactamase-negative haemophilus influenzae (median titers, 4 at 1.5 h and 2 to 4 at 3 h). other species (branhamella catarrhalis, streptococcus anginosus, staphylococcus aureus) were associated with lower bactericidal titers. killing curves performed against 12 strains demonstrated that the bioactivity of loracarbef (measured by the reduction in the area under the control growth curve) was significantly correlated with the concentration/mic ratio, whereas the initial rate of killing was not, once the concentration was greater than the mic. our results suggest that administration of 400 mg of loracarbef every 8 h might be associated with more favorable pharmacodynamic parameters against target bacteria.

TI  == changing flora in burn and trauma units: experience in the united kingdom.
AB  == bacterial colonization of burned and devitalized tissue is inevitable. the types  of organisms that are isolated from burn wounds depend on such factors as preexisting illness, types of topical antiseptics and antimicrobials used, microbial sampling techniques, and indigenous flora that inhibit the burn unit. among organisms that are capable of producing disease, staphylococcus aureus remains the most common isolate in the patient with burns. the decrease in the prevalence of pseudomonas aeruginosa, which was initiated by the advent of effective topical antiseptics, appears to have continued to the present. acinetobacter is now a common organism in the burn unit; although the organism has developed resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents, it infrequently causes serious problems. comparisons between burn units with intensive-care capability that practice an aggressive approach to surgical management and burn units that continue to use a more traditional approach have revealed little difference with  regard to incidence of or time to acquisition of potentially pathogenic bacteria. in a recent comparison that involved a unit of each type, marked reductions in the incidence of isolation of p. aeruginosa and streptococcus group a organisms were observed over the course of 2 years in both of the units. significant problems with viruses, yeasts, and fungi have not yet been encountered (or identified) in burn units; further study of the potential role of such organisms  in infection in the patient with burns is required.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of stratum corneum lipids was examined by screening in vitro various representative phospholipids and sphingolipids. of mixed galacto-cerebrosides; phosphatidic acid; phosphatidic acid-monomethylester-dioleoyl; phosphatidylethanolamine; phosphatidylethanolamine-beta-oleoyl-gamma-palmitoyl; phosphatidylcholine; d-sphingosine; d,l-sphinganine; 4-d-hydroxysphinganine; oleoyl-sphingosine; n,n-dimethylsphingosine; and stearylamine, only the sphingosines and, to a lesser extent, stearylamine were clearly and profoundly effective against staphylococcus aureus (4-log reduction at 6.25 micrograms/ml [20 microm]; 2-log reduction at 0.78 mu/ml [2.5 microm]). the sphingosines were similarly active against streptococcus pyogenes, micrococcus luteus, propionibacterium acnes, brevibacterium epidermidis, and candida albicans, moderately active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ineffective against escherichia coli and serratia marcescens. both erythro- and threo-isomers were effective. optimal inhibition was at 60 min incubation at 37 degrees c and at ph 6.5. antimicrobial activity, which was ca++ dependent, was confirmed in vivo by topical application and microbial challenge. because free sphingosines are available in the stratum corneum and other epidermal layers, these lipids may contribute to the cutaneous  antimicrobial barrier.

TI  == [toxic shock syndrome in infection due to streptococcus pyogenes].
AB  == acute infections with group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus normally take a favourable course under therapy with penicillin. only in a few cases has a completely different manifestation been described with multisystem failure similar to toxic shock syndrome induced by staphylococcus aureus. we report on 4  patients (1990/91) who showed this manifestation in spite of immediate antibiotic therapy. in 3 patients the suspected portal of entry was the skin, in 1 patient it was unknown. group a streptococci were grown from blood cultures from all 4 patients. without an underlying immune deficiency all 4 patients (age 22, 24, 38  and 51) went into septic shock with high fever, hepatic and renal impairment, diarrhea, dic and cerebral confusion. 2 patients died within a few days after developing acute respiratory distress syndrome and cerebral edema. all strains isolated from the patients were penicillin-sensitive, group a streptococci. 3 of  them were m-type 1, which are known to be more invasive. the bacteremia by itself is not sufficient to explain all complications and the high mortality rate. it is probable that streptococcal toxins, such as pyrogenic exotoxin a, streptolysin o, or a new unknown one, play a decisive role.

TI  == a zymographic assay for detection of hyaluronidase activity on polyacrylamide gels and its application to enzymatic activity found in bacteria.
AB  == a zymographic assay for the determination of hyaluronidase activity in cell-free  extracts on native polyacrylamide gels has been developed. in this assay an agarose replica of the polyacrylamide gel which contains hyaluronic acid and bovine serum albumin (bsa) was used. after an incubation at 37 degrees c to allow transfer and development of enzymatic activity, the hyaluronic acid and bsa were  precipitated in the agarose gel with 2 m acetic acid. areas of enzymatic activity appeared as clear zones in the agarose replica. the assay was sensitive and was used to demonstrate hyaluronidase activity in cell-free extracts from a number of bacterial and mammalian species.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of mdl 62,873, a semisynthetic derivative of teicoplanin,  in vitro and in experimental infections.
AB  == mdl 62,873 is an amide derivative of teicoplanin a2-2. like those of natural glycopeptides, its antibacterial activity is mediated by inhibition of cell wall  peptidoglycan synthesis. against streptococci and enterococci, the in vitro activity of mdl 62,873 was similar to that of teicoplanin and greater than that of vancomycin. against staphylococci, it has activity similar to that of vancomycin, and it was significantly more active than teicoplanin against coagulase-negative isolates. like teicoplanin and vancomycin, mdl 62,873 had slow but significant bactericidal activity (99 to 99.9% killing in 24 h) against staphylococci at concentrations near the mic. in murine septicemia studies with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae, the  50% effective doses were lower than those of vancomycin. in staphylococcal endocarditis in rats, mdl 62,873 at 20 mg/kg of body weight and vancomycin at 40  mg/kg, both doses given intravenously twice daily, had similar efficacies in reducing the heart bacterial load. these results probably reflect the longer half-life of mdl 62,873, which has a pharmacokinetic profile in rats similar to that of teicoplanin.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of meropenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of meropenem were compared with those of imipenem, ceftazidime, flomoxef, cefuzonam and cefotiam. meropenem showed a broad antibacterial spectrum against clinical isolates of gram-positive  and gram-negative bacteria. against gram-negative bacteria, with the exception of acinetobacter calcoaceticus, meropenem exhibited the most potent activity among the drugs tested. it inhibited all 330 strains of enterobacteriaceae at 0.78 mg/l. meropenem was sensitive against several cephem-resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, meropenem was four-fold more  active than imipenem and eight-fold more active than ceftazidime, with an mic90 of 0.78 mg/l. the therapeutic effect of meropenem on systemic infection in mice was ten to twenty-fold less than that of imipenem against staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. however, meropenem was as effective as imipenem on infections of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter calcoaceticus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. meropenem was eliminated from mice plasma two-fold faster than imipenem, with a plasma half-life of 7.6 min. from the above results the authors concluded that meropenem is a promising drug for clinical use.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefodizime.
AB  == cefodizime is a bactericidal cephem with the typical broad spectrum activity of an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, including both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria: its mic90 is 0.125 mg/l for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and other streptococci; and 0.05 mg/l for haemophilus spp., neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae and moraxella catarrhalis; while beta-lactamase positive strains of m. catarrhalis require 1 mg/l. less than 1 mg/l is needed for escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus spp. and shigella spp. the mic90 is 4 mg/l for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, morganella morganii, providencia spp. and most strains of serratia marcescens, citrobacter spp. and enterobacter spp. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis and most strains of pseudomonas spp. and acinetobacter spp. are considered cefodizime-resistant. cefodizime is unaffected by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but it is hydrolyzed by some chromosomally mediated enzymes, thus resembling other third-generation cephalosporins. cefodizime has high affinity for pbp 3 and pbp ia and ib (escherichia coli); in s. aureus it shows the highest affinity for pbp 1.

TI  == rapid antibody capture assay for detection of group-a streptococci using monoclonal antibody and colloidal gold-monospecific polyvalent antibody conjugate.
AB  == a rapid one step, sensitive and specific antibody capture assay for detection of  group-a streptococci from the throat swabs of children is described. monoclonal antibody either ma-106 or ma-107 specific for group-a streptococci polysaccharide (aps) was used as the capture antibody on nitrocellulose paper and rabbit monospecific polyvalent antibody conjugated with colloidal gold to detect the presence of antigen. the lower detection limit of this assay is 15.6ng aps/ml. the assay is specific for aps and failed to recognize polysaccharides obtained from group-b,-c,-g streptococci as well as staphylococcus aureus. antigen extracted from throat swabs of children who were positive for beta-hemolytic plaques (other than group-a streptococci) as seen on blood agar culture gave negative readings, thereby confirming the specificity of the assay for aps.

TI  == nasopharyngeal bacterial flora in otitis prone children treated with immunoglobulin.
AB  == the present study was undertaken to evaluate possible beneficial effects of regularly given, long term immunoglobulin prophylaxis of children below 2 years of age with recurrent acute otitis media (raom). the nasopharyngeal bacterial flora and the frequency of acute otitis media (aom) and secretory otitis media som were studied. every second of 44 children with 3 or more periods of aom during the last year received immunoglobulin intramuscularly (gammaglobulin kabi  165 mg/l, 0.45 ml/kg b.w.) every third week for 6 months, while the other 22 children served as controls. all children were followed for 12 months. immunoglobulin prophylaxis neither influenced the nasopharyngeal flora, nor the frequency of aom or som periods. children with aom or som more often harbored bacterial pathogens in their nasopharynx than children with normal middle ear status. also, the immunoglobulin prophylaxis did not influence the increased frequency of bacterial pathogens in the nasopharynx of children attending public  day care or family day care as compared to those taken care of at home.

AB  == the authors present the first results on the utilization of fish infusion (ifp) as a basic medium for the cultivation of bacteria. the infusion was obtained from a common marine fish, corvina (micropogonias furnieri) according to the technique used in the preparation of beef infusion broth. streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis were cultured in liquid and solid media prepared with ifp as well as in recommended standard media. solid media used for cultivation of s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, n. meningitidis and c. jejuni were supplemented with 5% of defibrinated sheep blood and for the latter, substances recommended to increase aerotolerance were included in solid and liquid media. all of these strains grew on the media prepared with ifp except s.  pneumoniae when cultured in ifp diluted 1:2 with a sodium chloride solution. only s. pyogenes produced colonies smaller than those of the standard medium. no more  differences were detect in the observation of colony morphology. the growth of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and b. subtilis was  measured in liquid media after 8 hours. in solid media, the growth index was expressed by dividing the number of colonies produced in ifp-agar and nutriente agar by the number of colonies on trypticase soy agar plates. some differences were observed in colonial size and morphology when compared with those generated  in standard media. the average value obtained from the analyses of total proteins by biuret reaction in twelve batches of ifp was 5.03 mg/ml. the experiments showed that culture media prepared with ifp supported the growth of bacterial strains used in this work. it suggests that fish infusion has promising conditions of being an alternative substrate for cultural purposes.

TI  == the comparative activity of fleroxacin, three other quinolones and eight unrelated antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the in vitro activity of fleroxacin, a new trifluorinated quinolone was evaluated against 432 bacterial isolates. fleroxacin was 1- to 2-fold less active than ciprofloxacin and at least as active as ofloxacin and lomefloxacin against most members of the family enterobacteriaceae. the mics of fleroxacin for 90% of strains tested (mic90) were < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml against all isolates of enterobacteriaceae except citrobacter freundii (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml) and serratia marcescens (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml). fleroxacin was as active as ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and lomefloxacin against pseudomonas spp, (mic90 for all quinolones tested were > 8 micrograms/ml). acinetobacter and haemophilus influenzae were very susceptible to fleroxacin; however fleroxacin was 1-fold less active than lomefloxacin against acinetobacter and at least 1-fold less active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against h. influenzae. methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of staphylococcus epidermidis and  methicillin-susceptible strains of s. aureus were very susceptible to fleroxacin, with an mic90 < or = 1 microgram/ml (range 0.5-1 microgram/ml). methicillin-resistant s. aureus and staphylococcus spp. other than aureus and epidermidis were not susceptible to fleroxacin (mic90 > 8 micrograms/ml). in addition, fleroxacin as well as ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and lomefloxacin were inactive against enterococcus spp. (mic90 > 8 micrograms/ml). streptococcus pneumoniae and s. pyogenes were resistant to both fleroxacin and lomefloxacin but were very susceptible to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. these results suggest that  fleroxacin represents a valid therapeutic option in the treatment of infections caused by most enterobacteriaceae and some species of staphylococcus.

TI  == evaluation of the bactericidal activity of temafloxacin.
AB  == although the fluoroquinolones share many properties, these agents differ in their ability to kill the same bacterial strain. the bactericidal activity of temafloxacin against a number of pathogens has been compared with that of other fluoroquinolones by determination of minimal bactericidal concentration, time-kill kinetics, and postantibiotic effect. studies have demonstrated that temafloxacin has equivalent or superior ability to kill when compared with other  fluoroquinolones. temafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and pd 117558 were more active than other fluoroquinolones against mycobacterium avium complex, with 90% minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc90s; 8-16 micrograms/ml) four- to eightfold greater than 90% minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic90s; 2 micrograms/ml). against chlamydia trachomatis the mic90 and mbc90 of temafloxacin were both 0.25  microgram/ml; ciprofloxacin was less active (mbc90 twice the mic90), and norfloxacin was least active. temafloxacin demonstrated more rapid killing kinetics than did ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin at all concentrations tested against streptococcus pyogenes. findings were similar against streptococcus pneumoniae at antibiotic concentrations of 1-2 micrograms/ml. similar time-kill curves against  escherichia coli were observed for temafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and difloxacin. time-kill kinetics of temafloxacin against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa) were superior to those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. postantibiotic effect with temafloxacin against legionella pneumophila showed a considerable delay in regrowth, and temafloxacin  delayed regrowth of mrsa and mssa to a greater extent than did ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin. by the three methods used in the studies to assess bactericidal activity that are currently published, temafloxacin had equivalent or superior activity to the comparative fluoroquinolones tested. other organisms remain to be tested and the significance of these findings determined in clinical studies.

TI  == stimulation of monokine production by lipoteichoic acids.
AB  == lipoteichoic acids (ltas) isolated from bacterial species, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes a, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and listeria monocytogenes, were tested for their ability to stimulate the production of interleukin-1 beta (il-1 beta), il-6, and  tumor necrosis factor alpha in cultured human monocytes. ltas from s. aureus and  s. pneumoniae failed to induce monokine production when applied in the concentration range of 0.05 to 5.0 micrograms/ml. however, ltas from several enterococcal species (0.5 to 5 micrograms/ml) induced the release of all three monokines at levels similar to those observed after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. the kinetics of il-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha release elicited by ltas closely resembled those observed following lipopolysaccharide application. cytokine production occurred in the presence of both fetal calf serum and autologous human serum. hence, it was not dependent on complement activation and could not be suppressed by naturally occurring human antibodies. deacylation caused the total loss of monocyte stimulatory capacity. deacylated ltas were unable to prevent monocyte activation by intact ltas, so primary binding of these molecules probably does not involve a simple interaction of a membrane receptor with the hydrophilic portion of the molecule. the results identify some species of ltas as inducers of monokine production in human monocytes.

AB  == determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) provides data on the susceptibility or resistance of a bacteria; however, in susceptible bacteria this parameter is not predictive of effectiveness of the antimicrobial agent. bactericidal activities of cefadroxil, of amoxicillin, and of the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination on bacteria commonly found in ent and lower respiratory tract disease were studied comparatively. the antibiotics were  given by the oral route to six healthy volunteers. with beta-lactamase-producing  and non-beta-lactamase-producing strains of escherichia coli, amoxicillin produced mics consistent with susceptibility but failed to exhibit a bactericidal effect, whereas cefadroxil was bactericidal. combination of amoxicillin with an inhibitor did not modify this activity on e. coli and failed to produce a bactericidal effect on klebsiella pneumoniae similar to that seen with cefadroxil. amoxicillin with and without clavulanic acid exhibited comparable effectiveness on streptococcus pyogenes and s. pneumoniae. the bactericidal effect of cefadroxil on s. pneumoniae was of similar magnitude but shorter duration than that of amoxicillin. cefadroxil and the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination had similar bactericidal effects against staphylococcus aureus. these antibiotics exhibited a time-dependent effect on gram positive microorganisms. these pharmacodynamic data, together with measures of bactericidal activity, may  be very helpful for selecting the appropriate antibiotic and dosage.

AB  == clinical evaluation in pediatrics on cefdinir (cfdn, fk482) (5% fine granules), a new oral cephem, was performed. 1. cfdn was administered to 112 pediatric patients with ages between 1 month to 13 years with various infections. dose levels used were 3.0-8.9 mg/kg (mean 5.1 mg/kg) t.i.d. for 3-14 days (mean 6.7 days). the studied patients included 2 patients with scarlet fever, 6 with acute  pharyngitis, 6 with acute rhinopharyngitis, 52 with acute purulent tonsillitis, 8 with acute bronchitis, 24 with acute pneumonia, 7 with acute urinary tract infections, 1 with acute vaginitis, and 6 with impetigo. total doses ranged from  0.6 to 4.05 g. one hundred eleven of the 112 patients were evaluated for clinical efficacy and all the patients were evaluated for safety. 2. clinical effects were excellent in 51 cases, good in 57, and fair in 3 with an extremely high efficacy  rate of 97.3%. efficacy rates were 100% in scarlet fever, acute pharyngitis, acute purulent tonsillitis, acute bronchitis, acute vaginitis and impetigo, and 83.3%, 95.7%, 85.7% in acute rhinopharyngitis, acute pneumonia, and acute urinary tract infections, respectively. good clinical effects were observed regardless of diseases. 3. causative organisms were identified in 79 cases, of which 71 were found to be monobacterial infections and 8 were found to be multi-bacterial infections. in mono-bacterial infections, clinical efficacies were 100% for those caused by staphylococcus aureus/streptococcus pyogenes/streptococcus pneumoniae/beta-streptococcus except those in a and b groups with an overall efficacy of 100% against gram-positive cocci (gpc) and they were 89.5%, 100%, 100% for those caused by haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, and  escherichia coli, respectively, with an overall efficacy of 90.3% in gram-negative rods (gnr). in multi-bacterial infections also, a clinical efficacy of 100% was obtained. 4. bacteriological effects were studied for 89 strains in the 79 cases. the eradication rate for a few strains of s. pneumoniae was low, 25%, but it was 100% for s. aureus, with the same results for s. pyogenes, and beta-streptococcus. the eradication rate on gpc was high 94.1%. among gnr, 66.7%  of e. coli, 50.0% of h. influenzae, and 71.4% of h. parainfluenzae was eradicated. the overall eradication rate for gnr was 55.3%, lower than that for gpc. microbial substitutions were observed in 13 cases, with haemophilus sp. replacing other bacteria. 5. diarrhea and soft stools were noted in 4 and 2 patients, respectively. the severity of these side effects, however, was slight and it was possible to continue the cfdn treatment.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == lack of emergence of significant resistance in vitro and in vivo to the new azalide antibiotic azithromycin.
AB  == in vitro experiments were performed in which 6 to 12 strains of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae and enterobacteriaceae were passaged nine times in sub-lethal concentrations of azithromycin or control  antibiotics. streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus quickly became resistant to rifampin as the mic90 increased from 0.1 to greater than 50 micrograms/ml for both species. the mic90 of azithromycin, erythromycin, amoxicillin and cefaclor increased by three dilutions for staphylococcus aureus.  the mic values of azithromycin for streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae and enterobacteriaceae strains did not change significantly. however, for haemophilus influenzae and the enterobacteriaceae strains, the mic values of erythromycin and oral cephalosporins increased four-fold. in the in vivo experiments, mice infected with staphylococcus aureus or escherichia coli contaminated sutures were administered azithromycin for three days, and on day 6  viable bacterial cells were recovered from the infection site. the sustained tissue concentrations of azithromycin indicated that the organisms would have been continuously exposed to azithromycin at the site of infection. colonies isolated from azithromycin-treated and non-treated mice were cultured and their susceptibility to azithromycin compared. the azithromycin mic values for staphylococcus aureus cultures from treated and non-treated animals were identical. the azithromycin mics for escherichia coli recovered from treated animals were on average, less than one dilution higher than for control cultures. emergence of significant resistance to azithromycin in the laboratory was not observed with the pathogens tested.

AB  == we examined mics of 6 oral new quinolones and 4 oral cephems against bacteria isolated from patients at 6 hospitals in osaka during the period from january to  june in 1990, and the following results were obtained. 1. all species excluding streptococcus pyogenes were more sensitive with less frequencies of resistance to new quinolones than to cephems. in new quinolones, tosufloxacin (tflx) was the most active against gram-positive cocci and ciprofloxacin (cpfx) and tflx had the highest activities against gram-negative rods. 2. resistant (mic of cpfx greater  than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml) strains to new quinolones were observed at higher frequencies than 10% among staphylococcus spp., enterococcus faecalis, citrobacter freundii, morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, serratia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia and xanthomonas maltophilia. 3. the frequency of staphylococcus aureus resistant to new quinolones isolated from in-patients or urine was significantly higher than that from out-patients or other sources. on the other hand, there was no significant difference in resistance frequencies of p. aeruginosa due to types of patients or sources. but, there were significant differences in frequencies of resistant organisms of either species to new quinolones among hospitals. 4. twenty-seven strains (19.7%) of 137 s. aureus strains examined were methicillin-resistant, and they were similarly resistant to new quinolones also. methicillin susceptible s. aureus were also similarly sensitive to new quinolones.

AB  == betalactamase-producing organisms are responsible for an increasing number of ent and lower respiratory tract infections. or cephalosporins and the combination of  amoxicillin with the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid are alternatives to ampicillin therapy. the killing activity of cefadroxil on the organisms most often responsible for ent and respiratory infections was evaluated in vitro using a viable bacteria count method, comparatively with cefaclor, josamycin, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. killing activity was found to be time-dependent for  all the antimicrobial agents studied. cefadroxil exhibited the same bactericidal  effect on streptococcus pyogenes and s. pneumoniae than the other agents. haemophilus influenzae and an increasing number of pneumococcus strains were resistant to josamycin which is therefore not appropriate for first-line therapy. as compared with amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefadroxil was less active on h. influenzae and more active on staphylococcus aureus. production of beta-lactamase failed to influence the killing activity of cefadroxil. these bacteriologic data, together with results of pharmacologic studies (long half-life and good penetration within tissues) can explain the clinical successes obtained with cefadroxil in ent and lower respiratory tract infections.

AB  == in the subjects of 835 strains of 37 clinically isolated microbial strains, which were separated and identified among materials collected from patients with various infections and which were sent from medical therapeutic institutions throughout japan in 1990, for the purpose of examining the antimicrobial activity of cefpiramide (cpm), its minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), together with those of other cephem antibiotics, was determined, and the following conclusions  were obtained. 1. microbial strains in which no cpm-resistant strains emerged were streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and anaerobic gram-positive cocci. 2. in comparison with reports by many researchers at the former half of the 1980s, microbial stains suggesting an increase in resistance to cpm were staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and haemophilus influenzae, but also in other microbial strains the resistance to cpm was observed in high ratios. 3. among strains used in the test, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, cephamycin and oxime type cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacilli of enterobacteriaceae, and new quinolone-resistant microbes were observed in high ratios; therefore, it was considered that cpm could not exert sufficient  antimicrobial activities to these strains because of many resistant strains being complicated among these "cpm-resistant strains". 4. it was discussed that "the resistance mechanism observed throughout beta-lactam drugs as a while and the study themes in the dimension including social circumstances where resistant strains emerged", as pointed out by the authors in 1989, increased the significance of these days in the evaluation of timecourse changes in microbes resistant to specific drugs including cpm. 5. there are many unfavorable conditions in the antimicrobial activities of cpm to clinically isolated strains  in recent years. however, it was jointly confirmed that cpm maintained effective  antimicrobial activities to the majority of clinically isolated strains. furthermore, when it was additionally considered that cpm was one of not many cephem drugs having persistent blood levels, a conclusion was drawn that cpm was  one of clincally useful cephem drugs even at present.

AB  == newly synthesized 5-acylaminothiazolium salts and one 5-acylaminothiazolidine, considering their chemical structure and reactivity, have been proposed as potential inhibitors of bacterial serine dd-peptidases. a moderate antibiotic activity with (5-phenylacetylamino-3-thiazolio)acetate and (5-phenylacetylaminothiazolidin-3-yl)acetic acid was observed on staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923. the methyl- and tert-butyl esters of the thiazolium salt have  shown lower mic values. moreover, when introduced into an exponential growth phase culture of s. aureus, the three active thiazolium salts induced a partial lysis indicating an impairing of the bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. the observed time-dependent binding of the best compound to the pbps of s. aureus was too slow and occurred at too high concentrations to account for its mic value. consequently, the antibiotic activity of the thiazolium salts on the s. aureus cells seems not to be satisfactorily explained by a penicillin-like interaction with the pbps.

TI  == medical and microbiological problems arising from airborne infection in hospitals.
AB  == the practical importance and frequency of airborne nosocomial infections has been a matter of dispute for many years. this is because most of the pathogens acquired in hospitals are able to use various different routes of infecting the patient's body so that it may be difficult or even impossible to prove an individual infection to be airborne. only microbes such as streptococcus pyogenes, neisseria meningitidis, corynebacterium diphtheriae, mycobacterium tuberculosis, or certain respiratory viruses that are known to be predominantly transmitted by droplet infection from infected persons or healthy carriers, have  been accepted to the cause of airborne nosocomial infections. other pathogens such as legionellae, pseudomonads or clostridia may be distributed in the hospital environment via an insufficient or defective air-conditioning system, with or without humidification. the assessment of indirect airborne infections caused by infective particles derived from dust which has settled on furniture or the floor or which has been introduced to the hospital environment by shoes, open windows, building works or potted indoor plants is much more difficult. many gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus, mycobacteria, nocardiae, and endospores of clostridia and bacilli, as well as the reproductive elements of fungi do remain viable and infective in dry dust and may therefore infect patients when the dust is disturbed. in contrast to nosocomial infections due to  gram-negative bacteria, against which most preventive measures have been concentrated in the past and which are usually not airborne in origin, it appears that the possibility of direct or indirect transmission of hospital pathogens by  air has been underestimated.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == microbiological samples were collected from the ears of patients with otitis externa for a period of 1 year. altogether, 226 evaluable samples from 104 males  and 122 females were received. the age range of the patients was similar to that  of the norwegian population. a wide variety of bacteria and fungi was isolated. the commonest isolates, excluding normal flora, were staphylococcus aureus (34.1%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.1%) and streptococcus pyogenes (8.8%); 9.3% samples contained fungi. of all samples, 15% showed a mixture of gram-positive and gram-negative, potentially pathogenic, bacteria. infection due to gram-negative organisms alone was commoner in males, while the lack of any obvious microbial aetiology was more frequent in females. isolation of s. aureus  together with s. pyogenes was common but that of s. aureus together with s. pyogenes was common but that of s. aureus together with p. aeruginosa was unusual. in treated patients, the finding of streptococci and s. aureus was rare  whereas that of p. aeruginosa or absence of growth was common. otitis externa involving gram-positive bacteria seems to be more prevalent in our area than in that of other reported studies.

TI  == bacteriological investigations of clinical mastitis in heifers in sweden.
AB  == bacterial analyses were carried out of 2069 udder secretions, isolated from 1481  heifers with mastitis in eight veterinary districts in sweden. streptococci, e.g. streptococcus dysgalactiae and str. uberis, dominated the bacterial flora, being  isolated from 34.4 and 19.5% respectively of heifers with clinical mastitis occurring from puberty up to 14 d post partum. bacterial species generally regarded as important pathogens in the summer mastitis complex, e.g. actinomyces  pyogenes, stuart-schwan coccus and strictly anaerobic bacteria such as peptostreptococcus indolicus, fusobacterium necrophorum and bacteroides melaninogenicus were isolated at low frequencies (13.2, 6.3, 9.4, 3.8 and 1.3% respectively). when the cases of mastitis studied were restricted to those appearing in heifers pre partum, may 15 to october 14 (summer mastitis), these bacterial species were isolated at higher percentages (27.1, 14.4, 21.4, 13.5 and 5.2% respectively). these figures were, nevertheless, still lower than those published in reports from other countries. whether considered up to 14 d post partum or only pre partum, there were no significant differences in the frequencies of a. pyogenes isolated at different seasons. there were geographical differences in bacterial incidence, e.g. staphylococcus aureus was isolated significantly more often in northern regions whereas str. dysgalactiae was more common in the south. this and other swedish investigations support the theory that a. pyogenes and strictly anaerobic bacteria are 'secondary invaders' that depend on str. dysgalactiae to cause a primary infection. it is stressed that the udders of all heifers should be examined daily so that cases of mastitis can be treated immediately.

AB  == ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with a catechol moiety attached at position 7 of the cephalosporin ring, showed high in vitro activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and streptococcus pyogenes, with mics for 90% of strains tested (mic90s) of less than or equal to 0.39 micrograms/ml. morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, citrobacter freundii, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited with mic90s of less than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml. serratia marcescens was less susceptible to ro 09-1428, with a mic90 of 25 micrograms/ml. the most distinctive feature of ro 09-1428 was its potent activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus, with mic90s of 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. most of the ceftazidime-resistant strains of p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae, and c. freundii were  inhibited by ro 09-1428, while those of s. marcescens were resistant at a concentration of 12.5 micrograms/ml. ro 09-1428 was more active than ceftazidime  against staphylococci. pbp 3 was the most sensitive target in e. coli and p. aeruginosa. the response to ferric iron in growth medium suggests that ro 09-1428 may be taken up by transport mechanisms similar to those of other catechol cephalosporins. in accordance with its in vitro activity, ro 09-1428 activity was equal to or greater than ceftazidime activity in efficacy against experimental septicemias in mice. the results indicate that ro 09-1428 is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with advantages over ceftazidime in its activity against p. aeruginosa, staphylococci, and ceftazidime-resistant strains of c. freundii and e. cloacae.

AB  == bacteriological and clinical studies on cefodizime (cdzm, thr-221), a new cephem  developed by hoechst ag and roussel uclaf, were carried out and the results are summarized below: 1. against gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae, antibacterial activities of  cdzm were similar to those of cefotaxime (ctx), cefazolin, cefotiam and piperacillin. against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia sp., antibacterial activities of cdzm were similar to that of ctx, and superior to those of other tested antibiotics. especially against haemophilus influenzae and  branhamella catarrhalis, it showed an excellent antibacterial activity. 2. although the clinical efficacy was poor in 1 patient with sepsis caused by salmonella marcescens and in another with cervical lymphadenitis, in 5 patients with upper respiratory tract infection, 4 patients with bronchitis, 6 patients with bronchopneumonia, 18 patients with pneumonia, 5 patients with urinary tract  infection and 1 patient with enteritis, the clinical efficacy was excellent or good and the efficacy rate was 95.1% (39/41) including excellent efficacies in 25 cases. 3. bacteriologically, all identified causative bacteria were eradicated except for 1 case of salmonella sp., thus the eradication rate was 97.4% (38/39). especially s. pneumoniae in 10 cases, h. influenzae in 12 cases and b. catarrhalis in 3 cases were eradicated totally. 4. adverse reactions were studied in 46 cases, and digestive symptoms were observed in 9 cases (diarrhea 5 cases, loose stools 4 cases). eruption and vascular pain were observed in 1 case each. as digestive symptoms in 9 cases were mild, the treatment were not suspended. in  laboratory test values, elevation of got, elevation of gpt, elevation of bilirubin, and eosinophilia were observed in 1 case each. influences on blood coagulation parameters were studied. no change was observed between the beginning and the end of the treatment. from above results, we have concluded that cdzm is  a useful and safe antibiotic in pediatrics, administered at a daily dose of 20 mg/kg divided into 3 or 4 doses and administered intravenously.

TI  == fluid replacement protection of rabbits challenged subcutaneous with toxic shock  syndrome toxins.
AB  == toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (tsst-1) and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin a (spe a) belong to a family of pyrogenic toxins produced by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, respectively. both toxins are responsible for causing toxic shock syndrome (tss) and related illnesses, clinically characterized by multiorgan involvement. the most severe tss symptom is acute hypotension and shock after the initial febrile response. in this study, we examined possible mechanisms of shock development in tss, particularly the role of t-cell proliferation, endotoxin enhancement by toxins, and capillary leakage. american dutch belted rabbits, with subcutaneously implanted miniosmotic pumps filled with either tsst-1 or spe a, served as the animal model. for both tsst-1 and spe a-treated rabbits, administration of cyclosporin a prevented toxin-induced t-cell proliferation but failed to protect the rabbits. polymyxin b treatment of rabbits, to neutralize endogenous endotoxin, partially protected rabbits from challenge with either exotoxin; two of six rabbits survived on day 2 when treated with only tsst-1, whereas six of six animals survived after challenge with tsst-1 and polymyxin b. similarly, with spe a-treated rabbits, only 1 of 10 animals without polymyxin b treatment survived on day 8, but 4 of 6 rabbits survived on day 8 when given polymyxin b. fluid replacement was successful in preventing lethality. twelve of 14 rabbits survived when given tsst-1 with fluid, and all rabbits treated with spe a and fluid survived. finally, by using miniosmotic pumps, staphylococcal exfoliative toxin a and concanavalin a were administered to rabbits in an attempt to induce lethality. these two t-cell mitogens caused t-cell proliferation but failed to induce lethality in rabbits. the data suggest  that toxin interactions causing vascular leakage and to some extent endotoxin enhancement are of major importance in development of hypotension and shock in tss. it appears that t-cell proliferation may not contribute significantly to the induction of shock and death.

AB  == the enterotoxins and the toxic-shock-syndrome toxin-1 of staphylococcus aureus, the erythrogenic toxins of streptococcus pyogenes as well as a still uncharacterized exoprotein of mycoplasma arthritidis belong to a family of exotoxins, that have in common a potent mitogenic activity for t lymphocytes of several species. these proteins stimulate cd4(+)- and cd8+ t-lymphocytes by cross-linking the t-cell-antigen receptor with mhc-class-ii molecules on accessory or target cells. they are functionally bivalent molecules having distinct interaction sites for variable parts of the t-cell receptor and for nonpolymorphic parts of mhc-class-ii molecules. due to their preferential action  on t cells expressing certain v beta-parts of the t-cell receptor the designation "superantigens" has been proposed. the mechanism of t-cell stimulation has apparently been conserved in evolution and has been adapted to the host's t-cell-receptor repertoire. the t cells stimulating activity apparently contributes to the pathogenesis of certain infectious diseases. noteworthy, mice  express endogenous "superantigens" that have similar properties.

TI  == the relationship of tonsil bacterial concentration to surface and core cultures in chronic tonsillar disease in children.
AB  == fifty-five tonsils removed for chronic tonsillar disease (chronic tonsillitis and obstructive tonsillar hyperplasia) underwent surface swab and quantitative core cultures in order to identify the relationship between core bacterial concentration and the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsil surface. the accuracy of a single core culture was further established by quantitative cultures of 9 sections per tonsil in an additional 19 tonsils. the results indicate that many (61.5%) but not all aerobic bacteria which were found in the tonsil core were cultured from the surface of the tonsil. conversely, the tonsil  core bacteria with the highest bacterial concentrations are more likely to be present on the tonsillar surface and the greater the bacterial concentration, the more likely the bacteria are to be found in most if not all areas of the tonsil core. therefore, the core bacterial concentration appears to be related to the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsillar surface. surface bacteria may not,  however, be truly representative of the core bacterial environment. implications  for the management of chronic tonsillar disease will be discussed.

AB  == respiratory ailments are important causes of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. ethnobotanical surveys and literature reviews conducted in  guatemala during 1986-88 showed that 234 plants from 75 families, most of them of american origin, have been used for the treatment of respiratory ailments. three  gram-positive bacteria causing respiratory infections (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes) were used to screen 68 of the most commonly used plants for activity. twenty-eight of these (41.2%) inhibited the growth of one or more of the bacteria tested. staphylococcus aureus was inhibited by 18 of the plant extracts, while 7 extracts were effective against streptococcus pyogenes. plants of american origin which exhibited antibacterial activity were: gnaphalium viscosum, lippia alba, lippia dulcis, physalis philadelphica, satureja brownei, solanum nigrescens and tagetes lucida.  these preliminary in vitro results provide scientific basis for the use of these  plants against bacterial respiratory infections.

TI  == nonsporulating bacterial species contain dna sequences homologous to the bacillus spore-specific c-protein gene.
AB  == genes for small, acid-soluble spore proteins (sasps) are ubiquitous among the spore-forming bacteria and are expressed only during sporulation. although they perform the function of amino acid storage in spores, the members of the sasp-c multigene family probably serve additional functions, so that similar sequences might be present in non-spore-formers. using the sasp-c gene (ssp-c) as a hybridization probe, restriction digests of whole genomic dna from seven nonsporulating bacterial species were examined for similar sequences. hybridization was found in four species: streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, neisseria sicca, and mycobacterium phlei, indicating the presence of similar sequences in some, but not all, of the non-spore-formers. in each of these positive species, multiple bands hybridized. a 4.5-kb hybridizing fragment  from s. pyogenes and a 9.0-kb hybridizing fragment from m. phlei have been cloned and partially sequenced. these fragments show substantial dna sequence homology to ssp-c and their deduced amino acid sequences show substantial homology to sasp-c.

TI  == antibiotics and expression of microbial virulence factors: implications for host  defense.
AB  == the discovery that antibiotics are capable of modifying both the structural appearance and physiology of pathogenic bacteria when they are incorporated in the culture medium at sub-growth inhibitory concentrations, has led to numerous examples in which the expression of one or more virulence factors (both structural and soluble) is inhibited or potentiated--some of these bacterial products are recognized in their own right as substances which can interfere with one or more stages of the normal process of phagocytosis viz, chemotaxis and staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin; opsonization and m protein of streptococcus pyogenes; phagocytic ingestion and capsule of bacteroides fragilis; phagocytic killing and streptolysin o of streptococcus pyogenes. exposure to these bacteria  to low concentrations of various chemotherapeutic drugs can alter the efficacy of the phagocytic process. however, many examples exist in which no specific biochemical lesion induced by exposure to the antibiotic has been recognized. by  way of contrast some recent experimental studies using genetically defined variants of s. aureus expressing protein a, alpha-toxin, beta-toxin or coagulase  have allowed some discrimination as to the specifity of the drug action and the relative role of each virulence factor in bacterial pathogenicity. in particular  it can be recognized that the presence or absence of protein a either through drug treatment (clindamycin or fusidic acid) or through gene delation is critical in determining bacterial susceptibility to opson-ophagocytosis. extension of these studies to in vivo models will shed light on possible antibiotic-host defence interaction during chemotherapy.

AB  == necrotizing fasciitis is an uncommon and severe soft tissue infection characterized by cutaneous gangrene, suppurative fasciitis, and vascular thrombosis. the disease is usually preceded by trauma in patients that have systemic problems, most commonly diabetes and alcoholism. streptococcus pyogenes  and staphylococcus aureus are the most frequent bacterial etiologies; however, combinations of numerous facultative and anaerobic organisms have also been isolated. involvement of the face and periocular region is rare. a case is presented here, as well as a review of the clinical features of 15 other patients previously described, in whom eyelid necrosis due to periorbital necrotizing fasciitis developed. early surgical debridement and drainage of necrotic tissues  and appropriate parenteral antibiotics are the mainstay of therapy. the mortality rate in patients with periorbital spread was 12.5%, with the prognosis known to be adversely affected by delay in diagnosis and treatment and/or extension of infection from the face to the neck. reconstruction of the eyelids with skin grafts was necessary in most cases to avoid such complications as cicatricial lid retraction, lid malpositions, and lagophthalmos.

AB  == antimicrobial agents were used alone or in combinations in order to explore their effect on mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections. subcutaneous abscesses were induced in mice by single and mixed infections of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the infected animals were treated for 5 days with spiramycin, gentamicin or metronidazole alone, or metronidazole combined with spiramycin or gentamicin. animals were killed 5 days after inoculation and the bacterial contents of the abscesses determined. infection induced by a single species of bacteria always responded to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. in infections caused by two species of organisms, however, therapy directed at either the bacteroides sp. (with metronidazole) or the aerobes or facultative anaerobes (with spiramycin or  gentamicin) was effective not only in significantly reducing the numbers of the target organism but also, in 13 of 24 instances, in reducing to a small extent the numbers of the other bacteria. despite this phenomenon, in no instance did therapy with a single agent eliminate the infection and eradicate the untargeted  organism. the combination of spiramycin and metronidazole increased the reduction in numbers of b. melaninogenicus in single-organism infections and of bacteroides sp. in mixed infections with s. aureus and s. pyogenes. these findings support the need to aim treatment at all components of mixed infections.

TI  == antibiotic sensitivity pattern; experience at university hospital, riyadh, saudi  arabia.
AB  == results of sensitivity testing were discussed based on examination of 5192 isolates of the various bacteria isolated from clinical specimens from king khalid university hospital in riyadh, saudi arabia. streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were sensitive to penicillin and erythromycin. the sensitivity pattern of staphylococcus aureus was also predictable as they were fairly sensitive to both methicillin (98%) and erythromycin (96%). neisseria gonorrhoeae (27%) showed a high level of resistance to penicillin. the resistance of haemophilus influenzae to ampicillin and chloramphenicol was low. brucella species was sensitive to tetracycline and rifampicin; resistance to streptomycin  and cotrimoxazole was minimal being 1% and 6% respectively. the resistance of e.  coli, klebsiella species and proteus species to second and third generation cephalosporins and amikacin was fairly low ranging from 1.3% to 3%. the gentamicin resistance for these organisms was also within the acceptable range (3%-10%). gentamicin and amikacin resistance for pseudomonas aeruginosa was low (2-8%). salmonella typhi was sensitive to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, and chloramphenicol. salmonella enteritidis, shigella species, and enteropathogenic e. coli were highly resistant to various antibiotics. campylobacter jejuni was sensitive to gentamicin but 6% of isolates were resistant to erythromycin. ninety six percent of gram-negative rods except p. aeruginosa isolated from urine of patients having urinary tract infections were sensitive to amoxycillin-clavulanic acid. in addition, p. aeruginosa showed fairly low resistance to norfloxacin which is given orally to treat cystitis caused by this organism.

TI  == [acute hematogenous osteomyelitis due to ordinary germs in children with closed injuries. study of a series of 44 cases].
AB  == the retrospective study of a series of 44 cases of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in infants and children has shown that 16 out of the 44 patients (36%) have a history of previous trauma at the site of bone infection. seven infants were less than one year of age. for the remaining 37 children the incidence of previous local trauma rose to 43% (16/37). this incidence is similar to that in previous studies. acute hematogenous osteomyelitis follows blood-borne spread of a pathogen from a portal of entry. why hematogenous infection selects a particular bone is an enigma. trauma has been said to predispose to the localization of infection but the association between trauma and hematogenous osteomyelitis is only found in one-third of the cases in both this study and in previous series. however these cases with a history of local trauma raise questions regarding the concept of "locus minoris resistentiae" and its medicolegal consequences.

TI  == [biocompatibility studies of periodontal dressings].
AB  == periodontal packs have to be considered medications due to their direct contact to the gums and wound surfaces. for this reason a high cell biological compatibility has to be considered as one of their most important properties. for this reason, the cytotoxicity of all periodontal packs commonly used in germany was examined, using the "erlangen ciliate test". this method, which is commonly used to determine the cytotoxic and cytostatic properties of a wide variety of different materials and substances, is based on liquid cultures of the eucaryotic organism "tetrahymena piriformis", using an excellent correlation with mammalian  or human tissue cultures as well as the ld50. a significant toxicity of up to 50% could be shown in all but one periodontal pack. in addition, the antibacterial properties of the same materials were examined, using liquid cultures of staphylococcus aureus and hemolyzing streptococci group a. however, using this method, no significant antibacterial effects could be shown.

TI  == bronchial hyperresponsiveness and bacterial respiratory infections.
AB  == some studies suggest a potential role for bacterial respiratory tract infections  in the development of bronchospasm and the progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). patients with bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis have exaggerated airway reactivity; croup in children can also cause exaggerated upper and lower airway responsiveness. bronchial obstruction after inhalation of haemophilus influenzae and other bacteria has been reported. between january 1989 and june 1990 we and two other centers studied 193 patients suffering from acute  exacerbation of asthma. fifty-two (27%) of these patients had bacteria in their sputum. streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus,  moraxella catarrhalis, and h influenzae were the most commonly isolated bacterial species. antibiotics may be of value in the treatment of infective lung disease,  not only by killing bacteria but also by preventing increases in bacterial histamine levels within the lung airways. moreover, an antibiotic of proven efficacy can reduce airway reactivity in patients with bacterial exacerbations of copd or bronchial asthma. in 12 patients with acute bacterial exacerbation of asthma and high airway reactivity to methacholine, a ten-day course of treatment  with cefaclor and existing bronchodilators induced microbiologic cure and a slight but nonsignificant change in airway reactivity in nine patients. antibiotic therapy has a minor but clear role in the control of acquired bronchial hyperreactivity during bacterial respiratory infections in asthmatic patients; however, because of airway inflammation, an antibiotic's efficacy is evident only when the inflammatory process subsides. approaches designed to minimize airway reactivity may contribute to the prevention or reversal of respiratory failure during exacerbation of copd and bronchial asthma.

AB  == macrolide (ml) susceptibilities of clinically isolated bacteria obtained freshly  during 1989 were determined and year to year differences in ml-resistances of the clinical isolates in our laboratory were examined with epidemiological consideration in mind. 1. the distribution of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of mls against isolates of staphylococcus aureus showed 2 peaks, one peak  representing s. aureus isolates susceptible to mls and the other peak representing those resistant to mls. proportions of resistant isolates to various mls were 36% to erythromycin, 24% each to kitasamycin, josamycin, midecamycin and midecamycin acetate. mics of rokitamycin (rkm), however, distributed themselves into 3 peaks of less than or equal to 0.39 micrograms/ml (76%), 1.56-3.13 micrograms/ml (12%) and greater than or equal to 100 micrograms/ml (12%). staphylococcus spp. including staphylococcus epidermidis showed different resistance characteristics to 14-membered ring mls and to 16-membered ring mls. further, the proportion of resistant organisms to rkm was the smallest among proportions of resistant organisms to various 16-membered ring mls tested. these  differences in proportions of resistant organisms to different mls may have resulted from differences in resistance induction activities of different mls. the above described ratios of resistant organisms to mls among s. aureus did not  vary since 1975 among clinical isolates tested in our laboratory. 2. four per cent (4%) of streptococcus pyogenes isolates were mls resistant, and 18% of streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were resistant to mls. among the isolates tested in our laboratory since 1985, resistant isolates of s. pyogenes are clearly decreasing and those of s. pneumoniae seem to be increasing.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the bacteriology of the isolates from the throat swab and the sputum respectively of 2,539 patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in tohoku district of japan during the period from january to april in 1989 was documented. of the 2,539 patients, 1,694 had an acute upper respiratory infection, 609 had acute bronchitis, 46 had acute pneumonia, 84 had acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory infections and 106 had respiratory infections without diagnosis registered. 1887 (74.3%) strains of potential pathogens were recovered from 1507 (59.4%) of the 2539 cases. the rate of recovery of potential  pathogens was very high in patients of the younger age. these patients had elevated body-temperature. there were statistically significant differences in recovery rate when classified by diagnosis, prefecture and the period of investigation. of the 1,887 strains, 996 (52.8%) were gram-positive and 891 (47.2%) were gram-negative bacteria. the rate of recovery of gram-negative bacteria was high in patients who were less than 10 years old and more than 51 years old, in patients with pneumonia and chronic respiratory infections, and in  patients with fever. of the 1,887 strains, those which exceeded 100 were staphylococcus aureus (481 strains), haemophilus influenzae (340 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (329 strains), streptococcus pyogenes (117 strains) and  acinetobacter spp. (100 strains). species other than those mentioned above had less than 100 strains. in this group there were 39 strains of branhamella catarrhalis, 32 strains of escherichia coli, 97 strains of klebsiella spp., 40 strains of enterobacter spp., 25 strains of serratia spp., 12 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 43 strains of pseudomonas putida. there was a remarkable difference in recovery rate of each species when classified by diagnosis, age class, prefecture and the period of investigation, respectively. the above results indicated that gram-positive bacteria are more frequent than gram-negative bacteria, that enterobacteriaceae and glucose-non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria are only rarely found in primary care clinics, and that the bacteriology in primary care clinic is different from that of medical school-affiliated hospitals.

TI  == in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new oral cephalosporin bay  v 3522.
AB  == the activity of the new oral cephalosporin bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to mics of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. it was more active against streptococcus pyogenes (mic less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. groups b, c and g streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the mi"90 for streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for enterococci and listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most bacteroides spp. were resistant. the mic90 for beta-lactamase positive escherichia coli (producing primarily tem-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. the mic90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. the mic90 for moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, proteus  mirabilis, providencia spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. bay v 3522 was destroyed by tem-1, shv-1, tem-3 and p99 beta-lactamases.

TI  == regulation of human monocyte/macrophage function by extracellular matrix. adherence of monocytes to collagen matrices enhances phagocytosis of opsonized bacteria by activation of complement receptors and enhancement of fc receptor function.
AB  == in inflammation monocytes emigrate from the peripheral circulation into an extravascular area rich in extracellular matrix proteins. in this milieu, phagocytes ingest and kill invading pathogens. in the present studies, we found that monocytes adhered to type i collagen gels phagocytized 2.5-12-fold more opsonized escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae than plastic-adherent monocytes. the rate of phagocytosis and the number of bacteria ingested by collagen-adherent monocytes was equal to, or greater than, the number of bacteria ingested by 7-d cultured macrophages (m phi). although both collagen- and plastic-adherent monocytes were  bactericidal for e. coli and s. aureus, more bacteria were killed by collagen-adherent monocytes by virtue of their enhanced phagocytic capacity. cultured m phi only were bacteriostatic. adherence of monocytes to collagen gels  activated c receptors (cr) types 1 and 3 for phagocytosis, and enhanced fc receptor (fcr)-mediated phagocytosis. collagen- and plastic-adherent monocytes produced equivalent amounts of superoxide anion in response to phorbol myristate  acetate and opsonized zymosan. thus, the enhanced phagocytosis and killing of opsonized bacteria by collagen-adherent monocytes appear to be by regulation of the function of membrane cr and fcr, without apparent enhancement of the respiratory burst. these data suggest that adherence of monocytes to the extracellular matrix during inflammation may rapidly activate these cells for enhanced phagocytic bactericidal activity.

TI  == comparative study on the macrolides erythromycin and clarithromycin: antibacterial activity and influence on immune responses.
AB  == the in vitro activity of erythromycin and clarithromycin (a new macrolide antibiotic) on clinical bacterial isolates as well as their effects on the cellular and humoral immune responses in balb/c-mice and on human granulocytes/monocytes was investigated. treatment of balb/c-mice for 7 days with these drugs did not influence the delayed type hypersensitivity to oxazolone nor  the production of igg and igm immunoglobulins. in vitro, exposure of granulocytes to erythromycin resulted in increased phagocytosis only in higher concentrations  (20 mcg/ml), whereas clarithromycin enhanced chemiluminescence response of granulocytes in concentrations ranging from 2.5-20 mcg/ml. subinhibitory concentrations of both substances modified staphylococcus aureus and made them more susceptible for granulocyte phagocytosis.

TI  == a case of group b streptococcal pyomyositis.
AB  == the group b streptococcus is an opportunistic pathogen that causes a variety of serious infections including bacteremias, puerperal sepsis, and neonatal meningitis. group b streptococcal infections of muscle are rare. we report here an unusual case of group b streptococcal pyomyositis. pyomyositis arises predominantly from infections caused by staphylococcus aureus and, occasionally,  streptococcus pyogenes. because of the rarity of pyomyositis in temperate climates, the common lack of localizing signs or symptoms, and the frequently negative blood cultures, considerable delay often precedes the diagnosis of pyomyositis; in fact, the infection has been initially misdiagnosed as muscle hematoma, cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, osteomyelitis, or neoplasm. diagnosis may be greatly aided by radiologic techniques that can demonstrate the sites of muscle enlargement and the presence of fluid collections. the response to antibiotics is usually rapid, but resolution of the infection may require aspiration of deeply situated muscle abscesses. this report describes a diabetic  patient with an unusual presentation of pyomyositis that mimicked an acute abdomen.

TI  == cardiovascular infections: bacterial endocarditis of oral origin. pathogenesis and prophylaxis.
AB  == the diagnosis infective endocarditis describes infection of the endocardial surface of the heart and indicates the presence of micro-organisms in the lesion. in most cases, the heart valves are affected, but the disease can also occur on septal defects or on the mural endocardium. the disease has been classified as acute or subacute based on the progression of the untreated disease. the acute form has a fulminant course with high fever and leukocytosis with death in less than 6 weeks. it is most often associated with infections caused by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae or streptococcus pyogenes. the subacute (death within 6 weeks to 3 months) and chronic (death more than 3 months) forms are mostly described together. these forms usually occur in patients with prior valvular disease and are characterized by a slow, indolent course with low-grade fever, night sweats, and weight loss. this form is usually  caused by the viridansstreptococci. the above mentioned classification does not include the nonbacterial forms of endocarditis and enterococci often give rise to a disease intermediate between acute and subacute endocarditis. it is preferable  to have a classification based on the micro-organism responsible since this classification has implications for the course followed and the appropriate antimicrobial agent to use. the clinical manifestations of the disease are so varied that they may be encountered in most medical subspecialities. successful management is also dependent on the close cooperation of medical and dental disciplines.

AB  == the acute otitis media is a frequent infantile disease and, in 80% of cases, a bacterial strain can be isolated from the otorrhoea. haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae are the two major species isolated from auricular exudate, and represent two thirds of all isolated strains, with the others comprising staphylococcus aureus, branhamella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacteriaceae and corynebacteria. the treatment of this disease  is based principally on beta-lactams (aminopenicillins, cephalosporins) administered by the oral route. cefuroxime is a cephalosporin which is absorbed via the digestive tract in the form of cefuroxim-axetil. the activity of this compound was studied against 210 strains isolated from otorrhoea, collected from  children who presented an acute otitis media during the first half of 1989. these strains were: 112 strains of h. influenzae, of which 23 produced a beta-lactamase; 21 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae; 3 strains of streptococcus pyogenes; 10 strains of branhamella catarrhalis of which 9 produced a beta-lactamase; 18 strains of s. aureus; 14 strains of enterobacteriaceae, and  32 strains of corynebacteria. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of cefuroxime-axetil was measured by dilution in agar. the mics of cefuroxime against h. influenzae were low and similar (mic 50 = 1 mg/l; mic 90 = 1 mg/l) regardless of whether the strain secreted a beta-lactamase. overall, 90% and 98%  of the 210 strains tested here were inhibited by 1 and 4 mg/l of cefuroxime respectively. these results show that the antibacterial spectrum of cefuroxime-axetil appears to be ideally suited to the bacterial strains isolated  from acute otitis media.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of a new 7-dimethylpyridinyl quinolone, win 57273, was assessed by using in vitro and in vivo models. agar inclusion and broth dilution  in vitro tests revealed broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and selected gram-negative organisms, with the greatest potency observed against the  staphylococci. the mic for 90% of coagulase-positive strains tested (mic90) was less than or equal to 0.002 micrograms/ml; for the coagulase-negative strains the mic90 was 0.008 micrograms/ml. against enterococci the mic90 was 0.06 micrograms/ml, with comparable activity observed against group a and group b streptococci as well as against the pneumococci. in general, the mic90s for the gram-negative bacteria were less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. exceptions were serratia marcescens (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml), citrobacter freundii (mic90,  4 micrograms/ml), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). the greatest potency was observed against haemophilus spp. and neisseria spp., with mic90s of 0.06 and 0.016 micrograms/ml, respectively. broad-spectrum activity was also observed against anaerobes, with mic90s ranging from 0.125 to 0.5 micrograms/ml among the species tested. the in vivo efficacy was determined by using a murine model by calculating the 50% protective doses against a lethal bacterial infection caused by strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the staphylocci were most susceptible, with 50% protective doses for  all strains ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 mg/kg. with the exception of the pseudomonas  infection, which was refractory to treatment, animals that were part of the other infection models responded to less than 10 mg/kg. equivalent activity was seen with the subcutaneous or the oral route of drug administration. win 57273 was significantly more potent than ciprofloxacin in treating gram-positive bacterial  infections (2- to 20-fold) but was significantly less effective at treating gram-negative bacterial infections (30- to 300-fold).

TI  == differential binding of p. aeruginosa and s. aureus to corneal epithelium in culture.
AB  == adherence of bacteria to corneal epithelium is a prerequisite for corneal infection. we used two methods to study the binding of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus to rabbit corneal epithelial cells in culture. in the first method, rabbit corneal epithelial cells grown on glass slides were incubated with p. aeruginosa or s. aureus (10(7) cfu/ml) at room temperature for 90 min, and the bacterial binding to the epithelial cells was examined by light microscopy. both  p. aeruginosa and s. aureus bound to epithelial cells. p. aeruginosa was bound to the cell periphery whereas s. aureus was bound randomly to the cell surface. in the second method, suspension cultures of corneal epithelial cells were used. in  contrast to the findings in cultures on slides, binding pattern with cells in suspension was similar for both species and resembled that for s. aureus in cultures on slides. a much greater number of p. aeruginosa (186 +/- 11 bacteria/epithelial cell) than s. aureus (30 +/- 1.5 bacteria/epithelial cell) bound to epithelial cells grown on glass slides. in contrast, a similar number of p. aeruginosa (25 +/- 5.1) and s. aureus (20 +/- 4.7) bound to epithelial cells grown in suspension cultures. using either method, escherichia coli and streptococcus pyogenes did not bind significantly (less than 5/cell) to corneal epithelial cells. the above methods should prove useful for characterization of bacterial binding to corneal epithelial cells in culture.

TI  == adherence of staphylococcus epidermidis to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro mediated by lipoteichoic acid.
AB  == the adherence of two strains of staphylococcus epidermidis to human fibrin-platelet clots in vitro was investigated. both strains were noncapsulated, nonhemagglutinating, and nonslime producers. binding was not related to surface charge, carbohydrate profile, or hydrophobicity of the bacteria. adherence was reduced four- to sixfold (p less than 0.001) on pretreatment of bacteria with lipase, while neuraminidase, trypsin, phospholipase c, and sodium periodate did not alter their binding. pretreatment of bacteria with substances known to bind lipoteichoic acid (lta), such as human albumin and anti-lta antibodies, also resulted in a fourfold (p less than 0.001) reduction in adherence. prior incubation of clots with free lta, but not with deacylated lta, produced a fourfold (p less than 0.001) decrease in the adherence of homologous and heterologous strains of s. epidermidis. a similar reduction was also observed when ltas derived from staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes were used. these data provide evidence that the lipid moiety of lta has a central role in the adherence of s. epidermidis to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro.

TI  == contact neodynium-yttrium-aluminum garnet laser acts as a sterilizing scalpel.
AB  == as a cold knife cuts through contaminated or infected wounds, bacteria are dragged along with the blade of the knife through the entire wound. herein, the effect of incisions made with a cold knife is compared with that of incisions made by a contact neodynium-yttrium-aluminum garnet (nd:yag) laser. agar plates were inoculated with multiple strains of exogenous, endogenous, hospital-acquired and multiple antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria. while the cold knife dragged bacteria to sterile areas, incisions made with the contact laser were always sterile. in addition to not dragging bacteria, the tip of the contact laser sterilized itself and provided a bacteria-free zone on either side of the cut, depending on the power density applied. it appears that the contact nd:yag laser acts as a sterilizing wand while providing much needed tactile feedback, precision and hemostasis during surgical treatment with the laser.

AB  == the bacteriology of the isolates from the sputum or the throat swab of patients with respiratory infections visiting a doctor in private practice in sendai city  during the period from march in 1988 to february in 1989 was documented, and their sensitivity to 45 antimicrobial agents was determined. of the 568 patients, 514 cases had acute pharyngitis, 8 cases each had acute tonsillitis and acute bronchitis, 7 cases were acute pneumonia, 6 cases had herpangina, 18 cases had hand-foot-mouth disease with the signs of respiratory infections, 5 cases had varicella with the signs of respiratory infections and 2 cases were mumps with the signs of respiratory infections. three hundred strains of potential (greater  than or equal to 10(7) cfu/ml) pathogens were recovered from 293 of the 568 cases, which consisted of 124 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 58 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 45 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 26 strains of branhamella catarrhalis, 25 strains of streptococcus pyogenes, 9 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and 13 strains of other species, not including non-fermentile gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. staphylococcus aureus and other strains were documented simultaneously in 6 out of 7 cases in which multi-organisms were recovered. many strains of staphylococcus aureus were isolated from young patients throughout the year. on the other hand many strains of branhamella catarrhalis were isolated from elderly patients in winter. the sensitivity of 45  antimicrobial agents of 231 of 300 strains was determined by sensitivity disks (eiken, japan). no strain of the haemophilus influenzae in this study was resistant to ampicillin. none of the streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes was resistant to ampicillin or cefazolin. none of the staphylococcus aureus was resistant to cloxacillin, cefazolin, gentamicin or ofloxacin. we conclude from the above results that antibiotic-resistant strains are found presumably only in a very few cases in primary care clinic.

TI  == staphylococcal and streptococcal pyrogenic toxins involved in toxic shock syndrome and related illnesses.
AB  == toxic-shock syndrome (tss) is an acute onset, multiorgan illness which resembles  severe scarlet fever. the illness is caused by staphylococcus aureus strains that express tss toxin-1 (tsst-1), enterotoxin b, or enterotoxin c. tsst-1 is associated with menstrual tss and approximately one-half of nonmenstrual cases; the other two toxins cause nonmenstrual cases, 47% and 3%, respectively. the three toxins are expressed in culture media under similar environmental conditions. these conditions may explain the association of certain tampons with  menstrual tss. biochemically, the toxins are all relatively low molecular weight  and fairly heat and protease stable. enterotoxins b and c, share nearly 50% sequence homology with streptococcal scarlet fever toxin a; they share no homology with tsst-1 despite sharing numerous biological properties. numerous animal models for development of tss have suggested mechanisms of toxin action, though the exact molecular action is not known. the toxins are all potent pyrogens, induce t lymphocyte proliferation, requiring interleukin 1 release from macrophages, suppress immunoglobulin production, enhance endotoxin shock, and enhance hypersensitivity skin reactions. the genetic control of the toxins has been studied and suggests the exotoxins are variable traits. some additional properties of tss s. aureus which facilitate disease causation have been clarified.

AB  == the dual-action antibacterial r 23-9424 (desacetylcefotaxime linked to the quinolone fleroxacin) is a new antibacterial agent with excellent in vitro activity. it was evaluated for in vivo efficacy in comparison with the cephalosporin cefotaxime and the quinolone component, fleroxacin. ro 23-9424 demonstrated significant activity against all strains tested in systemic infections, including those strains resistant in vivo to cefotaxime (staphylococcus aureus 753, serratia marcescens sm and pseudomonas aeruginosa 8780) and fleroxacin (streptococcus pneumoniae 6301 and streptococcus pyogenes. in prophylactic studies, ro 23-9424 compared favorably with fleroxacin against escherichia coli and with cefotaxime against s. pyogenes, but ro 23-9424 was considerably more active than cefotaxime against e. coli and more active than fleroxacin against s. pyogenes. in a murine pneumonia model, ro 23-9424 was equivalent in activity to cefotaxime against s. pneumoniae and more active than cefotaxime against klebsiella pneumoniae. fleroxacin was inactive against s. pneumoniae and about 20-fold more active than ro 23-9424 against k. pneumoniae. in a murine meningitis infection caused by s. pneumoniae, ro 23-9424 was 3 times  as active as cefotaxime, while fleroxacin was inactive. when meningitis was induced by k. pneumoniae, ro 23-9424 was as active as the quinolone, while cefotaxime was inactive. in a neutropenic (immunocompromised) model, ro 23-9424 was more active than cefotaxime against p. aeruginosa and 5-fold less active than fleroxacin. in the control normal (immunocompetent) mouse infection, ro 23-9424 was 3-fold more active than cefotaxime, but 10-fold less active than fleroxacin.

TI  == induction of human tcr gamma delta + and tcr gamma delta-cd2+cd3- double negative lymphocytes by bacterial stimulation.
AB  == when human blood mononuclear cells (mnc) were incubated with heat-killed bacteria, proliferation of mnc was observed 5 days after stimulation, showing a peak on day 7. interestingly, the bioassay of the culture supernatant and northern blot analysis of mrna demonstrated that no il-2 production was associated with these proliferative responses. the induced lymphoblasts consisted predominantly of tcr gamma delta + (22.4 +/- 9.3%) and tcr gamma delta-cd2+cd3-(33.2 +/- 11.8%) double negative lymphocytes (n = 10), which were initially minor populations (less than 10%) in freshly isolated mnc. the prominent induction of tcr gamma delta + cells was confirmed by northern blot analysis. tcr gamma delta + cells induced by bacterial stimulation seemed to generate from lymphocytes lacking the apparent expression of gamma delta tcr. the inducing capability for double negative cells is present in a large number of species of bacteria, especially gram-positive bacteria. gel filtration analysis of ultrasonicated filtrates of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes revealed that a substance with an mr of 25-26 kd could be substituted for whole bacterial particles in the cell proliferative responses. in contrast to the purified protein derivative (ppd)-induced response, the response described here was inducible in the cord blood of neonates who had not yet been exposed to the corresponding bacterial infection. the physicochemical properties of the sonicated filtrates were different from those of ppd. these results suggested that the present phenomenon may be nonspecific, polyclonal (or oligoclonal) activation of tcr gamma delta + and tcr gamma delta -cd2+cd3- cells by bacterial  stimulation.

AB  == cells of streptococcus sanguis strain challis were incubated with sodium lauroylsarcosinate to extract surface proteins. a polypeptide of apparent molecular mass 16 kda comprising about 12% of the extract was purified using anion-exchange chromatography. the polypeptide was shown to be a phosphocarrier protein (hpr) that could also be found in the soluble (cytoplasmic) fraction from cells broken by homogenization with glass beads. in vivo labelling of s. sanguis  cells with 32pi showed that the polypeptide carried a heat- and acid-stable phosphorylation and that during sucrose starvation the hpr became dephosphorylated. antiserum raised to the s. sanguis hpr reacted on western blots with hprs from all oral streptococci tested, together with strains of s. pyogenes and s. salivarius, but not with hprs from s. faecalis or s. bovis, nor with proteins from staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, actinomyces viscosus and  various lactobacilli. the s. sanguis hpr had a high content of alanine (17.2%) and was similar in overall amino acid composition to the hprs from s. mutans an s. salivarius. the n-terminal residues (to 37) of the s. sanguis hpr showed strong sequence identity (82%) with the n-terminal sequence of s. faecalis hpr. it is suggested that hpr in s. sanguis is associated closely with the cytoplasmic membrane. non-disruptive methods of removing cell-surface proteins from streptococci effect release of hpr and possibly other cytoplasmic components.

TI  == deficient intracellular killing of bacteria by murine alveolar macrophages.
AB  == microbiologic methods were used to assess the in vitro phagocytosis and intracellular killing of various species of bacteria by freshly isolated murine peritoneal and alveolar macrophages. peritoneal macrophages showed effective phagocytosis of opsonized streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and listeria monocytogenes, and moderate ingestion of staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. alveolar macrophages were poor in phagocytosing opsonized s. pyogenes, s. aureus, and e. coli; ingestion of s. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, and s. epidermidis was moderate. peritoneal macrophages killed 40 to 80% of these bacteria intracellularly, but alveolar macrophages showed almost no intracellular killing of bacteria. to find  out whether there is a correlation between the poor bactericidal activity of alveolar macrophages and the oxygen-dependent microbicidal mechanisms of these cells, we determined the uptake of oxygen and the release of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide by macrophages at rest and after stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (pma) or opsonized s. aureus. upon exposure to these stimuli, peritoneal macrophages, but not alveolar macrophages, showed an increased uptake  of oxygen and release of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. because alveolar macrophages contain surface active material (sam), we investigated the phagocytosis and intracellular killing of bacteria and the release of hydrogen peroxide by peritoneal macrophages pretreated with sam. the results showed reduced phagocytosis and impaired intracellular killing of s. epidermidis by these macrophages. the release of hydrogen peroxide by sam-pretreated peritoneal  macrophages upon stimulation with pma or opsonized s. aureus was equal to that of the control peritoneal macrophages.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == cefixime, previously designated fk027, fr17027 and cl284635, is an orally active  cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity in vitro. it is particularly active against many enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae. streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and branhamella catarrhalis, and is resistant to hydrolysis by many beta-lactamases. cefixime has little activity  against staphylococcus aureus and is inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. cefixime is distinguished by its 3-hour elimination half-life which permits twice daily, or in many instances once daily, administration. comparative trials, though few, indicate that the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of cefixime 200 to 400mg daily administered as a single dose or in 2 divided doses, is comparable with that of multiple daily doses of co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim + sulphamethoxazole) or amoxycillin in acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection, with that of amoxycillin, amoxycillin/clavulanic acid and cefaclor in acute lower respiratory tract infections, and with that of amoxycillin and cefroxidine in adult patients with acute tonsillitis or pharyngitis. several comparative trials  in children with acute otitis media demonstrate the similar effectiveness of cefixime 8 mg/kg daily (in 2 divided doses, or as a single daily dose), cefaclor  20 to 40 mg/kg daily and amoxycillin 40 mg/kg daily in 3 divided doses. the most  frequently reported adverse effects, diarrhoea and stool changes, are usually mild to moderate in severity, transient, and mostly occur in the first few days of treatment with cefixime. thus, cefixime is an effective orally active cephalosporin with a relatively long elimination half-life permitting a simplified treatment regimen. it is a suitable alternative to cefaclor or amoxycillin in acute otitis media and acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections, and to amoxycillin or co-trimoxazole in acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of fk482, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == fk482 is an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin with a c-3 vinyl group. its activity was compared with those of cephalexin, cefuroxime, cefixime,  and amoxicillin-clavulanate. fk482 inhibited 90% of staphylococcus aureus isolates at 1 micrograms/ml and 90% of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae isolates at less than or equal to 0.012  micrograms/ml, superior to cephalexin and cefuroxime and similar to cefixime. it  did not inhibit oxacillin-resistant s. aureus. fk482 inhibited 90% of enterococcus faecalis isolates at 8 micrograms/ml. although 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, salmonella species, and shigella  species isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, fk482 was less active than cefixime against citrobacter, enterobacter, morganella, serratia, and providencia species, with mics for many isolates of greater than 8  micrograms/ml. fk482 inhibited haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations comparable to that of cefixime and superior to those of cephalexin and cfaclor. bacteroides and pseudomonas species were resistant. fk482 was not hydrolyzed by the tem-1 and tem-2 beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by tem-3 and the proteus vulgaris enzyme. it had a high affinity for chromosomal beta-lactamases.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of the new oral penem alp-201 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activity of the new penem derivative alp-201 against 226 aerobic and 350 anaerobic clinical bacterial isolates was determined using agar dilution techniques. for comparison amoxicillin, cefaclor, ceftazidime, doxycycline, erythromycin, imipenem and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were also tested with aerobic bacteria, and cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, imipenem, metronidazole and piperacillin with anaerobic bacteria. alp-201 was found to be highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, propioni-bacterium acnes, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria. pseudomonas aeruginosa and clostridium difficile were resistant to alp-201. when tested against aerobic bacteria using a high inoculum or using the broth dilution technique, the activity of alp-201 showed little dependence on inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to the inhibitory activity. further investigations are warranted with alp-201, which is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration.

TI  == [cefotetan in the therapy of respiratory infections. multicenter research].
AB  == in a controlled multicenter trial 291 patients have been treated with cefotetan.  they suffered from acute or chronic exacerbated bronchopulmonary disorders. in 110 patients it was possible to identify the etiological agent: enterobacteria (62), non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli (10), haemophilus influenzae (8), branhamella catarrhalis (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (19), staphylococcus aureus (12), streptococcus pyogenes (4). in the exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (203), cefotetan was generally administered at the dose of 1 g/12 h i.m., whereas it was administered at the dose of 2 g/12 h i.v. in acute infection. the mean duration of therapy was 8.8 days. positive clinical results were obtained in 251  patients (86.2%) with eradication of the pathogen initially isolated in 90.5% of  cases. cefotetan showed good local and general tolerance. the results obtained confirm those of studies concerning limited numbers of patients and show the efficacy of cefotetan both in acute and chronic pathologies, also in patients with serious involvement of their general conditions (concomitant pathologies, high mean age).

TI  == [pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefteram pivoxil granule in the pediatric field].
AB  == cefteram pivoxil (cftm-pi), the pivaloyloxymethyl ester of cefteram (cftm) in which aminothiazol was also introduced into the 7 position of cephem nucleus, is  a new oral cephem antibiotic. cftm-pi was absorbed through the intestines and hydrolyzed to cftm by esterases in the intestinal wall and existed in the body fluids as cftm. a tablet form of this drug has been released in japan and now a granular form for pediatric patients has been developed. we have determined mics  of 5 drugs (cftm, cephalexin (cex), cefaclor (ccl), ampicillin (abpc), erythromycin (em], against stock strains and mics of 6 drugs (cftm, cex, ccl, abpc, methicillin, cloxacillin) against fresh strains from patients received to cftm-pi, with an inoculum size of 10(6) cfu/ml. a total of 149 strains included gram-positive cocci i.e. staphylococcus aureus (11), streptococcus pyogenes (85), streptococcus agalactiae (16) and streptococcus pneumoniae (4), and gram-negative rods i.e. haemophilus influenzae (11), bordetella pertussis (11), escherichia coli (9), proteus mirabilis (1) and morganella morganii (1). the granular form of cftm-pi was administered to 9 boys (age: 8 years 3 months approximately 10 years  10 months) to determine serum and urinary concentrations of the drug and its urinary recovery rates using bioassay. doses of 1.5, 3.0 and 6.0 mg/kg were given orally 30 minutes after meal to 3 boys, respectively. urinary concentrations and  its urinary recovery rates of t-2525a, a main metabolite of cftm, were determined using high performance liquid chromatography (hplc). to study clinical and bacteriological effects of this drug, a mean daily dose of 3.3 mg/kg divided 3-4  times a day (3 times: 133 cases, 4 times: 9 cases) was administered for 8 days on the average to a total of 142 cases with pharyngitis (22), tonsillitis (12), acute bronchitis (3), pneumonia (11), pleurisy (1), scarlet fever (28), acute purulent otitis media (16), impetigo (13), abscess (2), purulent lymphadenitis (1) and urinary tract infection (33). adverse reactions and abnormal effects on laboratory test values attributable to this drug were studied in patients. the results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. with regard to gram-positive cocci, mics of cftm against 11 fresh strains of s. aureus ranged from 3.13 to 6.25 micrograms/ml except for 1 strain, thus cftm was equally effective to cex, but less active than the other drugs tested.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == randomized comparative study of ampicillin/sulbactam vs. ceftriaxone for treatment of soft tissue and skeletal infections in children.
AB  == in a prospective study 105 children hospitalized with soft tissue infection, 11 children with suppurative arthritis and 9 children with osteomyelitis were treated with either parenterally administered ampicillin/sulbactam or ceftriaxone. treatment was randomized using a computer-generated table in a 2:1 fashion: 84 patients received ampicillin/sulbactam and 41 patients received ceftriaxone. organisms isolated from wound site or blood cultures included staphylococcus aureus (33), streptococcus pyogenes (19), haemophilus influenzae (9) including 4 beta-lactamase-positive organisms, streptococcus pneumoniae (5),  neisseria gonorrhoeae (3) and 9 other organisms. clinical and bacteriologic response was satisfactory in 100% of the ampicillin/sulbactam-treated patients and in 93% of the ceftriaxone-treated patients. two patients with s. aureus infections treated with ceftriaxone had a delayed response and required change in therapy to parenterally administered oxacillin. ampicillin/sulbactam represents a potentially useful single agent for the treatment of cellulitis and bone or joint infections in pediatric patients.

TI  == detection of bacterial cell wall hydrolases after denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  == cell walls from various gram-positive bacteria were incorporated at a concentration of 0.2% (w/v) into polyacrylamide gels as a substrate for detection of cell wall hydrolases. bacterial extracts from crude cell wall preparations were denatured with sodium dodecyl sulfate and 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in gels containing bacterial cell walls. after renaturation in the presence of purified and buffered 1% (v/v) triton x-100, cell wall hydrolases were visualized as clear lytic zones against the opaque cell wall background. one to fifteen bands with lytic activity could be detected, depending on bacterial extracts and on the nature of the cell walls  incorporated into gels. crude cell wall extracts were the best source of cell wall hydrolases from various gram-positive bacteria such as clostridium perfringens (15 bands), micrococcus luteus (1 band), bacillus megaterium (4 bands), bacillus sp. (6 bands), b. cereus (3 bands), b. subtilis (7 bands), staphylococcus aureus (13 bands), streptococcus faecalis (3 bands), and strep. pyogenes (5 bands). molecular masses of cell wall hydrolases ranged from 17 to 114.6 kda. lytic activities against cell walls of corynebacterium sepedonicum (clavibacter michiganense pv. sepedonicum) could be shown with the cell wall extracts of strep. pyogenes (45.7 kda), strep. faecalis (67 kda), b. megaterium (67 kda), and staph. aureus (67 kda).

TI  == [pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil dry syrup in the field of pediatrics].
AB  == cefpodoxime proxetil (cpdx-pr, cs-807) is a new oral cephem derivative drug in which carboxylic acid was esterified to the 4-position of cpdx (oxime type cephem antibiotic). cpdx-pr is hydrolyzed mainly with esterase in intestinal wall and cpdx exists as an active form in body fluid. while there are numerous study reports using cpdx-pr in tablet forms in japan, the dry syrup formula for pediatric use was newly developed. the dry syrup of cpdx-pr was orally administered 20 minutes after meal to the 6 boys of ages from 8 years and 1 month to 10 years and 10 months, with doses of 3 and 6 mg/kg, respectively, for 3 cases each. serum concentrations and urinary concentrations and recovery rate of the drug were investigated. in addition to the above, the clinical and bacteriological studies were performed in a total of 105 cases consisting of children with ages ranging from 2 months to 11 years and 8 months, upon administering an average dose of 3.4 mg/kg, 3 to 4 times per day (96 cases of 3 times and 9 cases of 4 times). the 105 cases included 13 cases of pharyngitis, 21 cases of tonsillitis, 4 cases of acute bronchitis, 6 cases of pneumonia, 1 case of pleurisy, 13 cases of scarlet fever, 41 cases of urinary tract infection, 3 cases of posthitis and 3 cases of bacillary dysentery. drug sensitivity test was  performed for the following strains: (i) strains retained by our department; 52 strains of streptococcus pyogenes, 18 strains of streptococcus agalactiae, and 11 strains of bordetella pertussis, and (ii) strains isolated from cases to which cpdx-pr was administered; 2 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 8 strains of s. pyogenes, 2 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 10 strains of escherichia coli, and 1 strain of proteus mirabilis. drug sensitivities of the strains retained by  our department were tested with the inoculum sizes of 10(8) and 10(6) cfu/ml for  r-3746 (na-salt of cpdx), cefaclor (ccl), cephalexin (cex), amoxicillin (ampc), and methicillin (dmppc), and those against strains separated from the cases to which cpdx-pr was administered were tested with the same inoculum sizes for r-3746, ccl, cex, cefadroxil, ampicillin (abpc), dmppc and cloxacillin (mcipc). adverse reactions and abnormal clinical laboratory test results were also examined.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == effect of freezing on bacteriologic culturing of mastitis milk samples.
AB  == the objective was to determine the effect of freezing and length of freezing in a commercial freezer on the qualitative results of bacteriologic culturing of milk  collected from glands of cows with clinical or subclinical intramammary infections. a total of 182 milk samples from cows with clinical mastitis and 55 milk samples of cows with subclinical mastitis were taken from four problem herds. samples were split into four equal sub-samples. three of these were frozen immediately at -20 degrees c and 1 was submitted fresh for bacteriologic analysis. at 4, 8, and 16 wk after collection, samples were thawed and submitted  for bacteriologic culturing. freezing and increased length of storage resulted in 1) a decrease in the number of samples that had cultures of escherichia coli or actinomyces pyogenes; and 2) an increase in the number of samples that had cultures of coagulase-negative staphylococci. freezing had no effect on streptococci and staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == effects of microbial challenge on sleep in rabbits.
AB  == rabbits challenged with viable staphylococcus aureus exhibit marked time-dependent changes in sleep patterns. to examine the generality of this observation, we monitored sleep patterns for 24 h before and for 48 h after intravenous inoculation of rabbits with streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, or candida albicans. all three agents produced complex time-dependent changes in  sleep. inoculation with s. pyogenes or c. albicans increased the time spent in slow-wave sleep (sws) during h 4-20 after challenge. electroencephalographic delta wave amplitudes (dwa) increased during h 4-8 after injection, but decreased during h 24-38 after inoculation. altered sleep patterns were not observed when similar doses of heat-killed organisms were administered. in contrast, inoculation with e. coli produced a large increase in both sws time and dwa for the first 2-4 h after inoculation. dwa then decreased from 6 to 32 h after inoculation. similar effects occurred when heat-killed e. coli were administered. rapid eye movement sleep was reduced by all three agents. these data demonstrate  that altered sleep patterns occur in response to infectious challenge in rabbits, and that these changes are related to the type of infectious organism involved.

TI  == binding of novel macrolide structures to macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin b-resistant ribosomes inhibits protein synthesis and bacterial growth.
AB  == dimethylation of adenine 2058 in 23s rrna renders bacteria resistant to macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin b (mls resistance), because the antibiotic binding site on the altered 50s ribosomal subunit is no longer accessible. we now report that certain 6-o-methyl-11,12-cyclic carbamate derivatives of erythromycin are able to bind to dimethylated mls-resistant 50s ribosomal subunits, thus inhibiting protein synthesis and cell growth. one of these novel structures, an 11-deoxy-11-(carboxyamino)-6-o-methylerythromycin a 11,12-(cyclic ester) derivative, structure 1a, was studied in detail. it inhibited in vitro protein synthesis in extracts prepared from both susceptible and mls-resistant bacillus subtilis with 50% inhibitory concentrations of 0.4 and 20 microm, respectively. the derivative bound specifically to a single site on the 50s subunit of mls-resistant ribosomes prepared from b. subtilis and staphylococcus aureus, and no binding to 30s subunits was observed. the association rate constant of derivative 1a with sensitive and resistant ribosomes was 100- and 500-fold slower, respectively, than that of the parent compound, erythromycin, with sensitive ribosomes. the dissociation rate constant of 1a from sensitive and resistant ribosomes was 50- to 100-fold slower than the rate of erythromycin dissociation from sensitive ribosomes. furthermore, 1a binding to sensitive 50s subunits led to induction of ermc and ermd, while binding to resistant 50s subunits did not, showing that perturbation of sensitive and resistant 50s subunit function by 1a differs. these data demonstrated that 1a is  unique in its interaction with mls-resistant ribosomes and that this interaction  causes a novel allosteric perturbation of ribosome function.

TI  == effect of immune globulin intravenous on opsonization of bacteria by classic and  alternative complement pathways in premature serum.
AB  == the mechanisms involved in the effect of immune globulin intravenous (igiv) on bacterial opsonization by both complement pathways in premature serum were elucidated in this study. of the bacteria used, staphylococcus aureus and salmonella enteritidis were nonencapsulated while streptococcus pyogenes and escherichia coli 07 k1 were encapsulated. as demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence, igiv showed specific antibody titers of 1:32 for s. aureus and s. enteritidis and of 1:8 for s. pyogenes and e. coli 07 k1. igiv alone had no direct opsonic activity against these organisms. addition of igiv did not alter the opsonic activity of normal adult serum against these organisms. in contrast, addition of igiv promoted the opsonic activity of premature serum against the nonencapsulated bacteria to levels matching that in normal adult serum. the igiv preparation significantly improved the opsonization of bacteria by the classic (from 39 to 68% of that in adult serum) and alternative (from 22 to 97% of that in adult serum) complement pathways in premature serum. igiv also  markedly augmented c3 deposition on the bacteria by both complement pathways. these studies suggest that igiv containing high titers of specific antibodies promote opsonization of bacteria by the enhancement of complement pathway activation, especially the alternative pathway, in premature serum.

AB  == among the cutaneous effects of an essential fatty acid deficient (efad) diet are  hyperdesquamation, increased transepidermal water loss (tewl), and altered lipid  profiles, characteristics also common to inflammatory dermatoses. because fatty acids are antimicrobial, we examined the indigenous skin flora of normal and efad hairless mice, and compared the antimicrobial efficacy of lipids extracted from their stratum corneum. efad mice supported 100-fold more bacteria than normal mice, and were the only group from which staphylococcus aureus were routinely isolated. despite this greater carriage, in vitro experiments demonstrated that efad lipids are more lethal than normal lipids against streptococcus pyogenes, s. aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococcus sp., and a coryneform. skin fungi were equally susceptible to both extracts. after thin layer chromatography, the most active fractions were found to be glycosphingolipids and phospholipids. efad extracts had 35% more free fatty acids and 75% more glycosphingolipids; normal extracts had more triglycerides and phospholipids. s. aureus strain 502a survived equally well on efad as on normal mice. normal lipids applied on efad mice had no additional effect, but efad lipids on normal mice brought about a 35% reduction of the inoculated bacteria. if the mice were pretreated with alcohol, carriage of strain 502a was reduced by 71%. if instead the mice were previously washed with acetone to increase tewl, a 97% reduction of the staphylococcus occurred. the application of normal flora to such acetone-washed mice decreased the efficacy to 76%. efad and normal lipids on human subjects were equally ineffective in eliminating strain 502a.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == pacidamycins are nucleosidyl-peptide antibiotics which have activity only against pseudomonas aeruginosa. their mics for other organisms such as enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, most streptococci and other pseudomonas species are greater than 100 micrograms/ml. these compounds had no activity against erythromycin-susceptible streptococci. the mics for streptococcus pyogenes with constitutive- and inducible-type of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin resistance were 12.5 and 25 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mics against p. aeruginosa ranged from 8 to 64 micrograms/ml. the activity of these compounds was 1 to 2-fold less in serum than broth. time-kill curves were performed using 4 and 8 times the mic of pacidamycin 1. it  was bactericidal against p. aeruginosa (3 log10 decrease in 4 to 6 hours). at 24  hours, resistant mutants were found in the cultures. the mics of piperacillin and gentamicin for these mutants were the same as for the parent strain. the frequency of resistance to these compounds was less than 3.5 x 10(-6). the resistant mutants were stable after 10 transfers in antibiotic-free medium. the pacidamycins were inactive against p. aeruginosa in mouse protection test. after  a single subcutaneous injection of 25 mg/kg of pacidamycin 1, the cmax was approximately 50 micrograms/ml and the serum half-life was 0.5 hour.

TI  == activity of fce 22891 compared with cefuroxime axetil and cefixime in pulmonary and subcutaneous infections in mice.
AB  == the therapeutic activity of fce 22891 was compared with that of two new oral cephalosporins, cefuroxime axetil and cefixime against streptococcus pneumoniae respiratory infection and subcutaneous abscesses induced by mixed aerobes and anaerobes in mice. in experimental pneumonia fce 22891 was the most active antibiotic. in aerobic abscesses fce 22891 proved the most active agent in infections induced by methicillin susceptible and resistant staphylococcus aureus while all three compounds were very active, against str. pyogenes. in abscesses caused by gram-negative bacteria, fce 22891 showed good and constant efficacy. cefixime was the most active drug against the two susceptible strains of escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae and also against resistant esch. coli but was inactive against a strain of ent. cloacae that produced cephalosporinase. cefuroxime axetil was less active than the other two drugs against gram-negative  bacteria with adequate efficacy only against a susceptible strain of ent. cloacae. fce 22891 was more effective than cefixime and cefuroxime axetil in preventing and reducing the size of abscesses induced by bacteroides fragilis 101. we conclude that fce 22891, despite its short half life of 6 min in mice, exerts comparable and sometimes better activity than the two oral cephalosporins  characterized by longer half lives.

TI  == bacterial adherence of group a streptococci to mucosal surfaces.
AB  == it is now recognized that bacteria bind to and colonize mucosal surfaces in a highly selective manner. after the organisms penetrate the nonspecific mechanical and cleansing forces, ligands (or adhesins) on the surface of the bacteria interact in a lock-and-key (or induced fit) fashion with complementary receptors  on mucosal surfaces of the host. the adhesins are usually composed of proteins in the form of fimbriae or fibrillae and the receptors of glycolipids or glycoproteins. in group-a streptococci the adhesin, lipoteichoic acid (lta), is anchored to a protein(s) on the surface of the bacterial cells and interacts through its lipid moiety with fibronectin molecules deposited on and bound to the epithelial cells. in an attempt to locate the region of fibronectin recognized by lta and group-a streptococci, fibronectin was cleaved with thermolysin and the fragment mixture absorbed with staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes. staphylococci adsorbed several high molecular weight fragments as well as a 28- and a 23-kdalton fragment, whereas s. pyogenes cells absorbed only the 28-kdalton fragment completely. the adsorbtion of the fragments by s. pyogenes was blocked by lta. antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide copying the nh2 terminus of fibronectin reacted in a western blot with the 28-kdalton fragment, indicating that s. pyogenes and its lta react with the nh2-terminal region of fibronectin at a site distinct from that of s. aureus. our findings are consistent with the idea that lta mediates the attachment of group-a streptococci to fatty acid-binding sites of fibronectin deposited on mucosal epithelial cells.

TI  == roxithromycin. a review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and clinical efficacy.
AB  == roxithromycin is an acid-stable orally administered antibacterial macrolide structurally related to erythromycin. it has an in vitro antibacterial profile similar to that of erythromycin, with activity against staphylococcus aureus, s.  epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, branhamella catarrhalis, mycoplasma pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila, chlamydia trachomatis, gardnerella vaginalis, haemophilus ducreyi, some anaerobes and other less common pathogens. roxithromycin has a pharmacokinetic profile that is characterised by excellent enteral absorption achieving high concentrations in most tissues and body fluids. the results of clinical studies with roxithromycin have confirmed the potential for its use in a variety of infections, which was suggested by its antibacterial  activity in vitro and pharmacokinetic profile. clinical efficacy has been confirmed in the treatment of respiratory tract infections, including community-acquired and atypical pneumonias, ear, nose and throat infections, genitourinary tract infections, and skin and soft tissue infections. in a relatively small number of patients roxithromycin has generally been shown to be  as effective as erythromycin and other appropriate antibacterial drugs in some of the above indications. roxithromycin is well tolerated and has less potential than erythromycin to produce clinically significant drug interactions. thus, roxithromycin is an orally active drug which should prove a useful alternative when selecting antibacterial therapy for indications where macrolides are appropriate.

AB  == the pharmacodynamics of antibiotics, i.e. the rate of killing and the time before regrowth of surviving bacteria, may be important factors for determination of the dosage interval. in the present study the effect of protein binding, antibiotic concentrations, bacterial growth phase and bacterial inoculum on the rate of bacterial killing was investigated. the postantibiotic effect (pae) was also studied in vitro and in vivo. the killing rate of s. aureus did not differ when the bacteria were exposed to the same free concentrations of dicloxacillin in medium with and without albumin. protein binding per se did thus not diminish the bactericidal activity. a paradoxically reduced bactericidal effect was noted when s. aureus was exposed to high concentrations of dicloxacillin, cloxacillin and benzylpenicillin. for determination of pae of imipenem on ps. aeruginosa, counts  of viable bacteria were compared with assay of bacterial intracellular atp. both  methods demonstrated a pae for the strains tested at an inoculum of 10(6) cfu/ml. at an inoculum of 10(8) cfu/ml no pae was found, which coincided with a lack of bactericidal effect. both the pae and the bactericidal effect were restored with  aeration of the cultures, indicating insufficient penetration of imipenem to the  target sites at low oxygen tension. an in vivo model in rabbits with implanted tissue cages was developed for evaluation of the pae. group a beta-hemolytic streptococci showed a pae of approximately 2 h in vivo, which correlated well with the pae found in vitro. despite that streptococci in postantibiotic phase (pa-phase) were non-multiplying, such bacteria were killed as efficiently as previously untreated controls when exposed to 10xmic of penicillin both in vitro  and in vivo. however, streptococci in pa-phase were much more sensitive to the repeated challenge to subinhibitory concentrations of penicillin than previously  untreated controls. in vivo, no difference in sensitivity to sub-mic penicillin concentrations between streptococci in pa-phase and untreated controls was seen,  probably due to the presence of host factors in the tissue cage fluid. it seems that for streptococci, subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations are more important for the sucess with intermittent dosing than the pae, especially when a normal host defence is present.

TI  == [clinical studies on sultamicillin fine granule in pediatric field].
AB  == pharmacokinetics, safety and effects on bacterial infection of sultamicillin (sbtpc) fine granule were evaluated in 17 children. the results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. pharmacokinetics in 3 children receiving a single dose  of 10 mg per kg body weight were evaluated. the half-life of ampicillin (abpc) was 1.38 +/- 0.14 hours and that of sulbactam was 0.93 +/- 0.26 hour. 2. fourteen cases, including 7 tonsillitis, 2 pharyngitis, 2 bronchitis, and 1 each of cystitis, scarlet fever and cellulitis were treated with sbtpc fine granule. the  clinical efficacy rate was 100%. 3. bacteriological efficacies classified by causative organisms were evaluated in 5 children. staphylococcus aureus was responsible in 3 cases, streptococcus pyogenes in 1 case, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis in 1 case. eradication rate was 100%. sbtpc was more active than abpc against abpc-resistant strains and almost equal to or more active than  cephalexin or cefaclor. 4. the only abnormal laboratory test value observed was eosinophilia in 2 children. no side effects were recorded. from the above results it is concluded that sbtpc fine granule is one of first choices of effective, useful and safe antibiotics for the treatment of infections in pediatric field.

TI  == in vivo antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == the therapeutic activities of orally administered fk482 were compared with those  of reference antibiotics against systemic and local infections with a variety of  bacteria in mice and rabbits. in systemic infections in mice, oral fk482 was almost as effective as oral cefaclor (ccl) and more effective than oral cephalexin (cex) against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis infections. however, fk482 afforded superior protective activity when given subcutaneously against e. coli infection in mice,  and this activity was more potent than that of subcutaneously given ccl. in comparison with ccl, the reason that the in vivo activity of orally given fk482 against mouse systemic infections was weaker than had been anticipated from its potent in vitro activity was due to its poor oral absorption in mice. in local infections in rabbits, a species in which fk482 was better absorbed than in mice, fk482 was more effective than ccl, cex or amoxicillin (ampc). against pneumonia induced by s. aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, fk482 was as effective as ampc and more effective than ccl in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs of infected rabbits. in the oral treatment of experimental ascending pyelonephritis in rabbits, fk482 was superior to ccl and ampc against methicillin-resistant s. aureus infection, as effective as ampc and more effective than ccl against enterococcus faecalis infection, and as effective as cefixime (cfix) and more effective than ccl and ampc against e. coli infection in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the kidneys and urine.

TI  == topical mupirocin vs. systemic erythromycin treatment for pyoderma.
AB  == although topical antibiotics have been considered less than effective agents in the treatment of "impetigo," recent experience suggests that topical therapy has  a place as primary treatment of pyoderma and impetigo. this bacteriologically controlled, randomized study compared the safety and efficacy of mupirocin with oral erythromycin in the treatment of pyoderma and impetigo. a total of 29 mupirocin-treated and 30 erythromycin-treated patients completed the study. none  of the mupirocin-treated patients reported adverse experiences compared with 4 erythromycin-treated patients who reported 6 adverse experiences. the mupirocin-treated group had a significantly higher benefit:risk ratio than the erythromycin-treated group as measured by the investigator's global evaluation (p = 0.01). both treatments eradicated 100% of the two most common pathogens, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. results from this study demonstrate that mupirocin is as effective as systemic erythromycin ethylsuccinate for treatment of pyoderma and impetigo.

TI  == the role of haemophilus influenzae in the pathogenesis of tonsillar hypertrophy in children.
AB  == the role of specific bacteria in the pathogenesis of tonsillar hypertrophy in children in unknown. to determine the effect of specific bacteria on the presence and nature of tonsillar hypertrophy (measured both clinically and by tonsil weight), quantitative aerobic bacteriology was performed on 54 tonsil-core specimens from 54 children undergoing tonsillectomy for chronic tonsillitis and/or tonsillar hypertrophy. twelve tonsil-core biopsies from 12 children with no history of tonsil disease served as controls. haemophilus influenzae (hi), streptococcus pyogenes (sp), streptococcus pneumoniae (spn), and staphylococcus aureus (sa) were the most common microorganisms cultured from diseased tonsils. few bacteria were cultured from the cores of controls. hi was cultured as the dominant aerobic bacteria in 15 of 54 tonsils (27%). for hi alone, the number of  bacteria/gram tonsil showed a significant positive correlation to tonsil weight (p less than 0.05). fourteen of 15 (94%) tonsils with hi were found in patients with clinical tonsillar hypertrophy, while only 6 of 10 patients (60%) with sp and spn had tonsillar hypertrophy. of the 38 tonsils removed for obstructive symptoms (clinical hypertrophy), 14 of 38 (37%) cultured hi as the dominant microorganisms, whereas only 6 of 38 (16%) cultured sp. neither the type of hi (b vs. non-b) nor the presence of beta-lactamase production had a significant correlation to tonsil weight, bacterial load or the number of b- or t-cell subsets. the number of t-helper (th), t-suppressor (ts) and b-cells (per gram/tonsil) was markedly greater in all diseased tonsils than in controls. for both hi and sp the total number of bacteria/gram tonsil correlated positively to  the number of ts cells (p less than 0.003 and p less than 0.007, respectively). in patients with hi type b (hi-b), the tonsil weight correlated to an increase in ts and b-cells (p less than 0.004 and p less than 0.007, respectively). an increased presence of the ts and b-cells in the hi-b tonsils (and not in tonsils  with hi non-b) suggests a differential response by the tonsil to these distinct but related bacteria. the above data strongly support an etiological role for hi  in the pathogenesis of tonsillar hypertrophy in children. alterations in the relationship between th and ts cells may affect normal b-cell function and be implicated in this phenomenon. clinical implications for pathogenesis, antimicrobial therapy, and future directions for research are discussed.

AB  == rokitamycin (rkm) dry syrup, a newly developed macrolide antibiotic, was administered to children with ages between 6 months and 15 years and 10 months suffering from skin and soft tissue infections including 41 cases of impetigo, one case of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (ssss) and 2 cases of subcutaneous abscess totalling 44 cases. the average daily dose level used was 31.3 mg/kg divided into 3 or 4 doses, for an average of 6 days of treatment. mics of 4 different macrolide antibiotics including rkm, erythromycin (em), josamycin  (jm) and midecamycin acetate (mdm acetate) were determined against 32 bacterial strains isolated from these cases including 30 strains of staphylococcus aureus and 2 strains of streptococcus pyogenes. the inoculum level used was 10(6) cells/ml. among these strains of bacteria, 20 strains of s. aureus and 1 strain of s. pyogenes were also used, at the same inoculum size, for the determination of mics of 4 beta-lactam antibiotics including 3 different penicillins such as ampicillin (abpc), methicillin (dmppc) and cloxacillin (mcipc) and cefaclor (ccl), a cephem antibiotic. rkm was then evaluated through the above treatment for its clinical efficacy, bacteriological effects, side effects and effects on laboratory test values. obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. activities of drugs tested were compared to each other. mic90 of rkm against s. aureus averaged 0.39 microgram/ml, and against no strains of s. aureus showed mic values of higher than 25 micrograms/ml, thus, the antibacterial activity of rkm against  s. aureus was the highest among the 8 drugs tested. the activity of mcipc was next highest followed by that of dmppc, mic determination was done on only 2 strains, or, for some drugs, only one strain, of s. pyogenes, and rkm showed activities somewhat lower than abpc and em, and similar to jm and ccl within the  limited testing. 2. clinical efficacies of rkm determined by doctors in charge were 97.6% in the 41 cases of impetigo, with good or excellent efficacies were observed, 100% in the single case of ssss and the 2 cases of subcutaneous abscess. thus an overall efficacy on the 44 cases was rated very high, at 97.7%.  3. clinical efficacy rating according to accumulated scores was determinable in 37 cases including all the 3 diseases on the third day of treatment with an efficacy rate of 89.2%. ratings were determinable on the fifth and the seventh days of treatment in 24 and 21 cases, respectively, with all the cases judged good or excellent.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == bacteriological findings of acute maxillary sinusitis in young adults.
AB  == bacteriological findings in 339 sinus secretions obtained by puncture were investigated in 238 young adult patients with acute maxillary sinusitis. aerobic  and anaerobic cultures were performed immediately. a total of 76% of the secretions were positive. the most common pathogens isolated were haemophilus influenzae (50%), streptococcus pneumoniae (19%), streptococcus pyogenes (5%), and branhamella catarrhalis (2%). coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus were isolated in 8 and 1% of the specimens, respectively. the staphylococci were almost invariably present in low numbers and, therefore, probably represented nasal contamination. other aerobic species were found only occasionally. anaerobes were isolated in 5% of the secretions. in one-half of these, a low concentration of propionibacterium acnes was the sole anaerobe that  was found, and it was usually mixed with a facultative organism (suggestive of contamination with nasal flora). only 2% of the sinuses were considered to have true anaerobic infections (high concentrations of several species typical of anaerobic infection), indicating that anaerobes are not a significant cause of acute maxillary sinusitis in a young adult population. the high recovery of h. influenzae in this study indicates that aminopenicillins may be more appropriate  choice than conventional penicillin in the antimicrobial therapy of acute maxillary sinusitis (only 2 of 168 h. influenzae strains produced beta-lactamase).

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of sultamicillin against clinical isolates from upper respiratory tract infections].
AB  == sultamicillin (sbtpc) is a mutual prodrug in which ampicillin (abpc) and a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor sulbactam (sbt) are ester-bound in an equimolar ratio. sbtpc is hydrolyzed during absorption after oral administration to provide abpc and sbt for systemic circulation. in the present study, the antimicrobial activities of sbtpc against 50 isolates each of 6 species (staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes) of bacteria freshly obtained from upper respiratory tract infections were examined in relation to their bacterial beta-lactamase producing abilities. beta-lactamase producing strains were identified using the acidometry disc method with benzylpenicillin (pcg) of cefazolin (cez) as a substrate, and their frequencies of appearance were calculated as follows: s. aureus 86%; k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae 100%; b. catarrhalis 68%; h. influenzae 24%. fourteen per cent of s. aureus strains examined were beta-lactamase positive using both pcg and cez acidometry discs. sbtpc, however, demonstrated excellent antimicrobial activities even against these beta-lactamase producing strains. good activities were observed especially against those bacterial strains producing penicillinase (pcase). average mic80 values of sbtpc were 3.13 micrograms/ml for s. aureus and  k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, 0.39 micrograms/ml for b. catarrhalis and h. influenzae, 0.05 micrograms/ml for s. pneumoniae and 0.025 micrograms/ml for s. pyogenes. as sbtpc was shown to possess excellent antimicrobial activities against pcase producing strains, the enhancement in activities of sbtpc compared  to abpc alone can be attributed to the inhibition of beta-lactamase by sbt which, as noted above, is a component of sbtpc in an equimolar ratio to abpc.

TI  == many pulmonary pathogenic bacteria bind specifically to the carbohydrate sequence galnac beta 1-4gal found in some glycolipids.
AB  == pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death from infectious disease in the united states. to examine the possible role of carbohydrates as adhesion receptors for infection, several pulmonary pathogenic bacteria were studied for binding to glycosphingolipids. radiolabeled bacteria were layered on thin-layer chromatograms of separated glycosphingolipids, and bound bacteria were detected by autoradiography. the classic triad of infectious bacteria found in cystic fibrosis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus, along with other bacteria commonly implicated in typical pneumonia, such  as streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and certain escherichia coli, bind specifically to fucosylasialo-gm1 (fuc alpha 1-2gal beta 1-3galnac beta 1-4gal beta 1-4cer), asialo-gm1 (gal beta 1-3galnac beta 1-4gal beta-1-4galc beta 1-1cer), and asialo-gm2 (galnac beta 1-4gal beta 1-4glc beta 1-1cer). bacteria maintained in nutrient medium bind better than the same cells suspended in buffer. they do not bind to galactosylceramide, glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, trihexosylceramide, globoside, paragloboside, forssman glycosphingolipid, or several other glycosphingolipids tested, including the gangliosides gm1, gm2, gm3, gd1a, gd1b, gt1b, and cad. the finding that these pathogens do not bind to lactosylceramide suggests that beta 1-4-linked galnac, which is positioned internally in fucosylasialo-gm1 and asialo-gm1 and terminally in asialo-gm2, is required for binding. beta-n-acetylgalactosamine itself, however, is not sufficient for binding, as the bacteria did not bind to globoside, which contains the terminal sequence galnac beta 1-3gal. these data suggest that these bacteria require at least terminal or internal galnac beta 1-4gal sequences unsubstituted with sialyl residues for binding. other bacteria,  including mycoplasma pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, salmonella species, and  some e. coli, do not bind to the galnac beta 1-4gal sequence. the biological relevance of these data is suggested by our finding that substantial amounts of asialo-gm1 occur in human lung tissue.

AB  == in a crossover design study, we compared the plasma bactericidal activities of erythromycin estolate (500 mg) and erythromycin ethylsuccinate (600 mg) after administration of a single oral dose to 12 healthy volunteers. both erythromycin  esters displayed very good plasma bactericidal activities against streptococcus pneumoniae. the median bactericidal titers produced in plasma against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were significantly higher with erythromycin estolate than with the ethylsuccinate ester at both 2 and 8 h after dosing (p less than 0.05 by student's t test). both erythromycin esters showed rather weak bactericidal activity against branhamella catarrhalis; a further look at these results indicated that erythromycin estolate presented 50%  of the plasma samples at 2 h with bactericidal titers superior or equal to 1:8, versus 11% for the ethylsuccinate ester. of the 60 plasma bactericidal activity tests performed against staphylococcus aureus, only 6 (10%) and 3 (5%) exhibited  titers of 1:8 or greater for erythromycin estolate and erythromycin ethylsuccinate, respectively. clinical trials are warranted in which these products are compared in infections other than streptococcus pyogenes pharyngitis, for which the clinical superiority of erythromycin estolate has been demonstrated.

TI  == use of antibiotics in the management of postirradiation wound infection and sepsis.
AB  == ionizing gamma irradiation depresses the host defenses and enhances the susceptibility of the immunocompromised host to local and systemic infection due  to endogenous or exogenous microorganisms. trauma and wounding act synergistically and decrease the survival after exposure to irradiation. the current antimicrobial agents suitable for controlling serious infections and their use in post irradiation local and systemic infection with and without trauma are discussed. the experience gained in managing immunocompromised patients following chemotherapy is reviewed. empiric single agent or combination  agent therapy should be directed at the eradication of potential gram-negative as well as gram-positive pathogens. the most important organisms known to cause these infections are pseudomonas sp. and enterobacteriaceae. management of intra-abdominal infections following trauma should include early surgical correlation and antimicrobials directed against the bacteroides fragilis group and enterobacteriaceae. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes cause most skin and soft tissue infections following trauma. chemoprophylaxis of enteric sources of systemic infection can be achieved by antimicrobials that selectively inhibit the enterobacteriaceae sp. and preserve the anaerobic flora.  the management of infection in the injured and irradiated host includes supportive and restorative therapy. supportive therapy includes debridement and cleansing of wounds, fluids, immunoglobulin, and antimicrobials. restorative therapy includes definite surgery repair and replenishment of the immune system by use of immunomodulators, growth factors, and bone marrow transplantation. further studies are needed to examine the usefulness of presently available drugs and experimental agents in the irradiated and traumatized host.

AB  == three strains of staphylococcus aureus, serotype 18, cowan i and serotype 66438,  and different species of streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes, str, mutans, str.  sanguis and str. faecalis) were tested for their adherence to buccal cells (as measured by interference contrast microscopy) and phagocytosis by rat polymorphonuclear leucocytes (pmns) (as measured by fluorescence microscopy with  a vital fluorochrome, acridine orange). pretreatment of cocci with serial two-fold dilutions of spiramycin (from 1/2 to 1/1024 the mic), increased the diameter of bacterial cells and decreased the adherence of staphylococci and streptococci to buccal cells. exposure of streptococci to 1/4 the mic of spiramycin led to an increase of the phagocytic capacity of pmns. pretreatment of pmns with a therapeutic concentration (2 mg/l) also stimulated the phagocytosis of streptococci. action of spiramycin on the phagocytosis of staphylococci varied according to the strain tested. although in-vitro results cannot be directly compared with in-vivo data, it is of interest that spiramycin decreases adherence of different gram-positive cocci and enhances phagocytic capacity of pmns.

TI  == the antibacterial activity of a new 3-azinomethyl-rifamycin.
AB  == the new 3-azinomethyl-rifamycin, spa-s-565, was shown to exert an effective antibacterial activity in vitro comparable to that of rifampicin. in fact, the antibacterial activity of spa-s-565 against numerous gram-positive cocci belonging to staphylococcus and streptococcus species as well as against 20 strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis, was similar to that of rifampicin. in swiss albino mice intraperitoneally infected with staphylococcus aureus oxford strain or streptococcus pyogenes, the protective activity of spa-s-565 and rifampicin was quite remarkable, and no significant difference was noted between  the two antibiotics. in m. tuberculosis-infected mice treated with the antibacterial agents every seven days, the protection exerted by spa-s-565 was significantly greater than that exerted by rifampicin.

TI  == synergy between spiramycin and metronidazole in the treatment of polymicrobial infections.
AB  == the in-vitro and in-vivo activity of metronidazole and spiramycin, singly or in combination, was tested in the eradication of infection caused by bacteroides spp. alone and in combination with neisseria gonorrhoea, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes or str. faecalis. the in-vitro tests consisted of determinations of the mics with or without the addition of a constant amount of the other antimicrobials. the mics of metronidazole for b. melaninogenicus, b. fragilis and b. bivius were significantly reduced by the addition of 0.125 mg/l spiramycin. the in-vivo tests were carried out in mice and consisted of measurements of the effects of the antimicrobial agents on the bacterial contents of abscesses induced by subcutaneous injection of bacterial suspension. combined  therapy of mixed infections showed further significant reduction of the numbers of bacteroides spp. in seven of 12 combinations and of the aerobic and facultative bacteria in four of 12 combinations. furthermore, a reduction in the  number of facultative anaerobes was noted in mixed infections with bacteroides spp. which were treated with metronidazole alone. the synergy in vitro and in vivo between metronidazole and spiramycin may have important clinical implications in the treatment of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infections.

TI  == [laboratory and clinical studies of rokitamycin in pediatric fields].
AB  == we have carried out laboratory and clinical studies on rokitamycin (rkm, tms-19-q). the results are summarized as follows. serum and urinary concentrations of rkm were determined in 6 children with ages between 6 and 12 years given single oral doses of 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg. mean serum concentrations peaked at 30 minutes after administration of 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg, and respective peak values were 0.30 microgram/ml, 0.79 microgram/ml and 1.32 micrograms/ml. biological half-lives for 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg were 2.0 hours, 1.65 hours and 1.36  hours. the 6-hour urinary recovery ranged from 1.11% to 2.58% after administration of 5 mg/kg, and the mean 6-hour urinary recoveries were 1.35% after administration of 10 mg/kg and 2.28% after administration of 15 mg/kg. therapeutic responses were recorded as excellent or good in 22 (73.3%) of the children, comprising 6 with tonsillitis, 2 with pharyngitis, 4 with bronchitis, 1 with bronchopneumonia, 1 with mycoplasma pneumonia, 2 with whooping cough, 5 with streptococcal infections, 5 with campylobacter enteritis, 3 with impetigo and 1 with ssss. the microbiological effectiveness of rkm on identified pathogens comprising 4 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 1 strain of streptococcus pneumoniae, 6 strains of streptococcus pyogenes, 4 strains of haemophilus influenzae and 5 strains of campylobacter spp. was not so satisfactory as evidenced by a eradication rate of 50.0%. no significant side effect due to the drug was observed in any cases. in conclusion, rkm was found to be efficacious and safe for the treatment of bacterial infections in children.

TI  == [studies on susceptibility of isolated organisms from pediatric infections against various antimicrobial agents].
AB  == twelve oral antimicrobial agents were tested for their antimicrobial activities against causative organisms isolated from pediatric infections. activities of these antimicrobial agents against streptococcus pyogenes were also examined in relation to t-antigen typing of the species. the results of the investigation are summarized as follows. 1. against staphylococcus aureus, rokitamycin (rkm), josamycin, ofloxacin, minocycline exhibited strong antimicrobial activities, and  few strains of s. aureus showed resistance to these antimicrobial agents. more strains exhibited resistance to erythromycin (em) than to other macrolide antibiotics (mls) examined. amoxicillin (ampc)-resistance was often observed also. 2. against s. pyogenes, beta-lactam antibiotics (beta-lactams) and rkm had  mic80 of 0.20 microgram/ml or below, and no resistant strains of this organism were observed against these antibiotics. only 2 resistant strains (2.0%) of s. pyogenes to mls were detected, but resistance to tetracyclines (tcs) was observed at a high frequency, with 71.4% or more strains among t-4, t-6, t-12 and t-28 antigen types exhibited resistance to tcs. among the 21 strains of t-12 antigen type examined, only one strain (4.8%) was found resistant to mls. these observations suggested that the reduction in the frequency of ml-resistant strains was not due to the reduction in the number of t-12 antigen type strains but due to losses of resistance factors against mls of plasmids. 3. antibacterial activities of beta-lactams and mls against streptococcus pneumoniae strains were  good, similarly to activities against s. pyogenes. but many strains of s. pneumoniae were resistant to tcs. 4. new quinolone antimicrobial agents (quinolones) showed excellent activities against branhamella catarrhalis strains  with em and rkm showing the next best activities. the number of resistant strains against quinolones, however, seemed to be on an increase. 5. quinolones had strong antimicrobial activities against haemophilus influenzae, few strains of which showed resistance to quinolones. ampc had the next best activity, but approximately 10% of h. influenzae exhibited resistance to this antibiotic. 6. against campylobacter spp., quinolones and mls showed the best activities with mic80 values at or below 0.25 microgram/ml, and no resistant strains of the species against these antimicrobial agents were observed. fosfomycin and tcs showed somewhat inferior activities to quinolones and mls, with beta-lactams showing still lower activities. 7. only few strains of mycoplasma pneumoniae and  chlamydia trachomatis were examined, but mls and tcs appeared to be effective against these organisms.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [a clinical study of rokitamycin in pediatrics].
AB  == a total of 29 patients with pediatric infections was treated orally with 21.4-44.4 mg/kg/day of rokitamycin (rkm) dry syrup. the obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. clinical responses to rkm in 24 evaluable patients were excellent in 2 and good in 3 of 5 patients with tonsillitis and laryngitis; excellent in 3 and good in 5 of 8 patients with bronchitis; excellent in 3, good  in 2 and fair in one of 6 patients with bronchopneumonia; excellent in 2 and good in the other of 3 patients with psittacosis; and excellent in 2 of 2 patients with campylobacter colitis. the overall efficacy rate was 95.8%. 2. bacteriological responses to the drug were: reduction in 1 and no change in the other of 2 strains of streptococcus pyogenes; eradication of a strain of streptococcus pneumoniae and 2 strains of staphylococcus aureus; eradication of 2 and no change in 3 of 5 strains of haemophilus influenzae; and eradication of 2 out of 2 strains of campylobacter spp. 3. diarrhea was complained of as an adverse reaction to the rkm medication by 1 patient, abdominal pain was reported  by another, and anorexia by another of the 27 patients treated. laboratory examination was performed on some patients, but not abnormal test values were found except in 1 case showing an increase in platelet count from 27.6 to 78.2 x  10(4)/mm8. the results suggested that rkm dry syrup might be a very useful and safe drug for the treatment of pediatric infections.

TI  == [appraisal of rokitamycin in the pediatric field].
AB  == in a study of rokitamycin (rkm) dry syrup for its usefulness in pediatric infections, the following results were obtained: 1. frequencies of rkm-resistant  strains among fresh isolates from sick children were very low, and 4.4% of 68 isolates of staphylococcus aureus, 4.2% of 48 isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, and none of 96 isolates of streptococcus pyogenes were found to be rkm-resistant. 2. hypo- to achlorhydria was found in 2 (3.77%) of 53 children. 3. when children were administered once orally with 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg of rkm dry syrup at fasting, mean peak values of plasma concentration were 0.25, 0.55 and 0.74 micrograms/ml with a t1/2 (beta) of 2.18, 1.97 and 2.00 hours, respectively. urinary recovery rates during the first 0-6 hours were quite low, and values were 1.21, 1.38 and 2.23%, respectively. 4. the clinical efficacy of rkm dry syrup was studied on children chiefly with acute pneumonia, mycoplasmal pneumonia and tonsillitis. among 379 children from whom pathogens had been determined, responses to the treatment were excellent in 186, good in 144, fair in 24, poor in 20 and unknown in 5 patients, the overall efficacy rate being 88.2%. among all 598 treated patients, including those with undetermined pathogens, responses were excellent in 247, good in 269, fair in 42, poor in 35 and unknown in 5 patients,  the efficacy rate being 87.0%. 5. the clinical efficacy of the drug in treating chlamydia infection in 12 patients including a chlamydia carrier and the clinical efficacy in treating campylobacter enteritis in 36 patients were studied. all the cases showed "good" responses. among 66 patients with mycoplasmal pneumonia, responses were excellent in 33 and good in 27 patients, with an efficacy rate of  90.9%. 6. the optimal dose of rkm dry syrup seemed to be in the range between 20  and 40 mg/kg. it appeared, however, that a dose of about 40 mg/kg would be required to eradicate the pathogen from the pharynx in s. pyogenes infection. 7.  adverse reactions to rkm dry syrup were found in 9 (1.45%) of 622 patients. the reactions were gastrointestinal symptoms except eruption occurred in 1 patient, but they were all mild. laboratory examinations revealed eosinophilia in 19 and abnormal hepatic enzyme activities in 8 of 455 patients studied, but such abnormalities were all transient and mild.

TI  == comparative study of cephalexin hydrochloride and cephalexin monohydrate in the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections.
AB  == in two prospective, randomized multicenter double-blind studies with a dosage of  either 250 mg given four times a day (study a) or 500 mg given two times a day (study b), the comparative efficacy and safety of cephalexin hydrochloride (ly061188; keftab) and cephalexin monohydrate (keflex) for treatment of skin and  soft tissue infections were determined. in study a, 97 patients received cephalexin hydrochloride and 101 patients received cephalexin monohydrate. in study b, 75 patients received cephalexin hydrochloride and 70 patients received cephalexin monohydrate. diagnoses included abscesses, cellulitis, wound infections, and infected dermatitis, and were comparable in the different treatment groups. pathogens were isolated from 82% of patients enrolled; the majority of isolates were of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, other staphylococcal species, and a few gram-negative bacteria. in study a, 68 of 71 (95.7%) evaluable patients who received cephalexin hydrochloride responded satisfactorily; 73 of 81 (90%) patients who received cephalexin monohydrate also  responded satisfactorily. in study b, 56 of 58 (96.5%) evaluable patients who received cephalexin hydrochloride responded satisfactorily; 47 of 50 (94%) patients who received cephalexin monohydrate also responded satisfactorily. an adverse clinical event leading to discontinuation of the treatment drug developed in 17 of 343 (4.95%) patients in both studies. no differences were noted between  the two drugs. skin eruptions, pruritus, and mild gastrointestinal symptoms were  the common adverse effects. these data suggest that cephalexin hydrochloride, a new formulation of cephalexin, is a safe and effective antimicrobial agent for treatment of a variety of skin and subcutaneous infections in a dosage of either  250 mg four times a day or 500 mg twice a day.

TI  == comparison of the microbiology of group a and non-group a streptococcal tonsillitis.
AB  == we studied the microbial flora of tonsils removed from 20 children who suffered from recurrent group a beta-hemolytic streptococcal (gabhs) tonsillitis and 20 who had tonsillar hypertrophy following recurrent non-gabhs tonsillitis. similar  polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic flora were recovered from the cores of the tonsils in each group. beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (blpb) were recovered more often in the group with gabhs. this difference was due mostly to the lower incidence of beta-lactamase-producing strains of branhamella catarrhalis and bacteroides sp in hypertrophic tonsils following non-gabhs tonsillitis. beta-lactamase-producing staphylococcus aureus was found with equal frequency in  both groups. these findings demonstrate that although blpb are recovered more often in recurrently inflamed tonsils following gabhs infection, blpb also can be found in hypertrophic tonsils following non-gabhs tonsillitis.

AB  == one hundred patients with impetigo were prospectively enrolled in a study to determine the current etiology and comparative therapeutic efficacy of two oral antimicrobial agents active against both group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (gabs) and staphylococcus aureus. after obtaining a bacterial culture from a representative impetiginous lesion, the children were randomized to receive 10 days of either erythromycin (40 mg/kg/day) or dicloxacillin (25 mg/kg/day). s. aureus alone was isolated from 46 children, and in association with gabs from 25  children. gabs alone was isolated from nine patients. of the 59 evaluable children with s. aureus isolates, 28 of 29 treated with erythromycin and 29 of 30 treated with dicloxacillin were cured or improved on follow-up examination. thus, we conclude that erythromycin is the drug of choice for impetigo in our midwestern locale because of its high efficacy and relatively low cost.

AB  == the postantibiotic effect (pae) is the suppression of bacterial growth that persists after limited exposure of organisms to antimicrobial agents. we demonstrated and standardized the in vivo pae in a thigh infection model in neutropenic mice. inhibitors of protein and nucleic acid synthesis induced paes of 1.4-7.5 h against aerobic gram-negative bacilli, whereas beta-lactam antibiotics did not induce significant paes. against aerobic gram-positive cocci, cell wall-active agents and inhibitors of protein and nucleic acid synthesis induced paes of 1.2-7.1 h, except for penicillins, which did not induce paes against streptococci. with few exceptions the in vivo pae correlated well with the pae reported in prior in vitro studies. residual drug in thigh tissue did not cause the pae. theoretically, the presence of a pae may allow antimicrobial agents to be given more intermittently without organism regrowth after drug levels fall below the minimal inhibitory concentration.

AB  == tonsil core specimens of 54 children, (3 to 12 years) with clinical evidence of chronic tonsillitis and/or "idiopathic" tonsillar hypertrophy, were studied for the effect of the magnitude of aerobic bacterial load on tonsil size and the absolute numbers of b- and t-cell subsets. tonsillar core specimens obtained from ten children with no history of ear, nose, or throat infections and normal appearing tonsils served as controls. the findings of this study indicate that tonsil size was directly proportional to the mean bacterial load in colony forming units/g tonsil (cfu/g) even in the absence of a clinical history of infection (p less than 0.01). a mean bacterial load of 2.4 +/- 2.1 x 10(5) cfu/g  tonsil was seen in diseased tonsils as compared to 1.6 +/- 2.4 x 10(4) cfu/g tonsil in normal controls (p less than 0.01). hemophilus influenzae (type b and non-b), staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes were the most common pathogens recovered in the largest numbers from diseased tonsils; control tonsils harbored few bacteria in their cores. the absolute number of immunocompetent cells/g tonsil including t-helper, t-suppressor and b-cells (s-ig+), were significantly greater in diseased tonsils  than in controls (p less than 0.001). increasing microbial load (cfu/g tonsil) correlated with increased numbers of t-helper (p less than 0.01) and b-cells (p less than 0.01). these data strongly support a bacterial etiology for chronic tonsillitis as well as "idiopathic" tonsillar hypertrophy. bacterial induced proliferation of immunocompetent cells may be one underlying mechanism for chronic tonsillar disease in children.

AB  == the new fluoroquinolones have activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. in order to differentiate between the compounds, the authors have compared their in vitro activities and correlated these results with their in vivo efficacies. norfloxacin (n), pefloxacin (p), enoxacin (e), ofloxacin (o), difloxacin (d), ciprofloxacin (c), fleroxacin (f), a-61827 (a), temafloxacin (t)  and lomefloxacin (l) were used in these studies. in vitro, c was the most active  compound against gram-negative aerobic bacteria and a was the most active compound against gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria. in mouse protection  tests, c, d, a, o, t and f had similar activities against escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. d, t and a were the most active quinolones against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes and strep. pneumoniae in mouse protection tests. d was the most active agent against intracellular infection with salmonella typhimurium, followed by o, t, a and f. the other compounds were  ineffective in this test. all the quinolones were effective in treating e. coli pyelonephritis in mice. the doses required to treat p. aeruginosa pyelonephritis  in mice were four times greater than those required to treat e. coli. resistant p. aeruginosa mutants could be isolated from the kidneys after quinolone treatment. systemic infections with e. coli, staph. aureus and p. aeruginosa in neutropenic mice required high doses of the fluoroquinolones and f, t and a were  ineffective at doses of 100 mg/kg against p. aeruginosa in this model. differences in in vitro potencies were not reflected in in vivo efficacies.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == sterility testing of home and inpatient parenteral nutrition solutions.
AB  == the microbial contamination rate was compared for parenteral nutrition solutions  prepared by patients for home use and by pharmacy personnel for inpatient use. phase i validated the ivex 0.22-micron inline filter as a tool for microbiological testing by inoculating small numbers of organisms in 5% dextrose  injection and testing for recovery. phase ii validated the same method for determining microbial contamination of total parenteral nutrition (tpn) solutions. phase iii compared inpatient and home tpn microbial contamination rates using the methodology validated in phase ii. test organism inocula used in  phase i and ii were candida albicans, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes. all contaminated  solutions in phase i showed visual turbidity within 48 hr, and all test organisms were recovered and identified. all phase ii-contaminated tpn solutions showed visual turbidity after 96 hr, and all test organisms were recovered and identified. one hundred postinfusion tpn samples were collected randomly during phase iii from inpatient parenteral nutrition patients. six patients and two hospitals participated in the study. none of the 44 home parenteral nutrition samples and none of the 56 inpatient tpn samples developed visible turbidity. subcultures of each sample on blood agar were negative for microbial growth. this described methodology offers an effective means to establish contamination rates  of parenteral nutrition solutions after administration.

TI  == bactericidal activity of teicoplanin in an in-vitro two-compartment kinetic model.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of teicoplanin was studied in a model system in which antibiotic concentration is continuously varied. a two-compartment open model was used to reproduce, in vitro serum pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin in humans during 24 h after iv administration. staphylococcal and streptococcal strains of  various species were tested. teicoplanin showed rapid killing of staphylococcus epidermidis and staph. hominis. all strains of staph. epidermidis were rapidly killed in spite of the high mic values (4-16 mg/l). the killing effect against staph. haemolyticus was less rapid and marked than against staph. epidermidis, with strain to strain variation. a 99.9% kill was achieved for most strains within 22 h, but with other isolates regrowth occurred which was due to the presence of highly resistant cells in the original population. other staphylococci (staph. aureus, staph. saprophyticus) and streptococcus pyogenes, str. bovis and str. salivarius were reduced by 99.9% within 22 h. bactericidal activity against other streptococci (str. mutans, str. agalactiae, str. faecalis, str. faecium) was less marked; against str. sanguis teicoplanin was bacteriostatic.

AB  == in 1985, the second reported outbreak of group a beta-hemolytic streptococcal (gabhs) skin infections among us meat packers was recognized at an oregon meat-packing plant. all 69 plant workers were interviewed and examined for the presence of pustular, draining, or inflamed lesions. during a three-month period, 44 episodes of skin infection occurred in 32 workers, all but four of whom worked in boning or killing areas. acquiring infection was associated with job category  (relative risk [rr], 5.7; 95% confidence intervals [ci], 2.9 to 11.3) and having  at least two hand lacerations (rr adjusted for occupation, 6.2; 95% ci, 3.0 to 12.5). group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus (18), staphylococcus aureus (12), or  both (20) were isolated from 70 lesions cultured. meat is suspected as a vehicle  of transmission because cultures of two meat specimens contained the same gabhs strain as did 24 isolates from patients. increasing reports of gabhs skin infections in meat packers suggest that this occupational risk may be more common than is realized.

TI  == changes in expression of bacterial surface antigens induced by antibiotics and their influence on host defenses.
AB  == concomitant with the discovery that a number of antibiotics were able to induce profound morphological changes (increased septation, thickened walls, filamentation) at low concentrations their ability to inhibit bacterial protein/polysaccharide synthesis was determined. in particular toxin and extracellular enzyme biosynthesis could be repressed by the lincosamines, fusidic acid, erythromycin and streptomycin in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. several of these exoproducts act as antigens associated with microbial virulence  and are therefore of importance in pathogenicity. likewise structural components  such as fimbriae in escherichia coli, m protein in streptococcus pyogenes, protein a in staphylococcus aureus and capsule in bacteroides fragilis and haemophilus influenzae were not synthesised when the producer bacteria were grown in low concentrations of antibiotic. these products, through their importance as  impedins of opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis by white blood cells, are important determinants in the host-parasite relationship. by their loss during drug exposure, potentiation of opsonophagocytosis occurred leading to more rapid  killing of the pathogen. the immunogenicity of the antibiotic-damaged bacteria was also changed under these circumstances.

TI  == effect of prophylactic antibiotics upon mixed infections with bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == antimicrobial agents were used alone or in combinations to explore the effect of  prophylactic antimicrobial therapy. subcutaneous abscesses in mice were induced by single and mixed infections of bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus, group a streptococci and escherichia coli. the infected mice were treated with three doses of gentamicin, cefoxitin, metronidazole or clindamycin alone or else  metronidazole or clindamycin in combination with gentamicin. mice were sacrificed five days after inoculation and the bacterial contents of the abscesses were determined. infection induced by a single bacteria always responded to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. however, in infections caused by two organisms, therapy directed at either the bacteroides fragilis (with metronidazole or clindamycin) or escherichia coli (with gentamicin) was effective in not only significantly reducing the colony forming units (cfu) of the target organism but also reducing the number of untreated bacteria. clindamycin alone was effective in reducing the cfu of both components of mixed infections of bacteroides fragilis with either staphylococcus aureus or group a streptococci. cefoxitin alone and the combination of either clindamycin or metronidazole with gentamicin were effective against all mixed infections. these data support the need to provide coverage for all components of mixed infections with single or combination therapy.

TI  == pharmacokinetic and in vivo studies with azithromycin (cp-62,993), a new macrolide with an extended half-life and excellent tissue distribution.
AB  == azithromycin (cp-62,993), a new acid-stable 15-membered-ring macrolide, was well  absorbed following oral administration in mice, rats, dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys. this compound exhibited a uniformly long elimination half-life and was distributed exceptionally well into all tissues. this extravascular penetration of azithromycin was demonstrated by tissue/plasma area-under-the-curve ratios ranging from 13.6 to 137 compared with ratios for erythromycin of 3.1 to 11.6. the significance of these pharmacokinetic advantages of azithromycin over erythromycin was shown through efficacy in a series of animal infection models. azithromycin was orally effective in treating middle ear infections induced in gerbils by transbulla challenges with amoxicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae or susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; erythromycin failed and cefaclor was only marginally active against the h. influenzae challenge. azithromycin was equivalent to cefaclor and erythromycin against streptococcus pneumoniae. in mouse models, the new macrolide was 10-fold more potent than erythromycin and four other antibiotics against an anaerobic infection produced by fusobacterium necrophorum. similarly, azithromycin was effective against established tissue infections induced by salmonella enteritidis (liver and spleen) and staphylococcus aureus (thigh muscle); erythromycin failed against both infections. the oral and subcutaneous activities of azithromycin, erythromycin, and cefaclor were similar against acute systemic infections produced by streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus viridans, or s. aureus, whereas azithromycin was more potent than erythromycin and cefaclor against the intracellular pathogen listeria monocytogenes. the pharmacokinetic advantage of azithromycin over erythromycin in half-life was clearly demonstrated in prophylactic treatment of an acute mouse model of s. aureus infection. these properties of azithromycin strongly support the further evaluation of this new macrolide for use in community-acquired infections of skin or soft tissue and respiratory diseases.

TI  == bacterial adherence: the attachment of group a streptococci to mucosal surfaces.
AB  == it is now recognized that bacteria bind to and colonize mucosal surfaces in a highly selective manner. after the organisms penetrate the nonspecific mechanical and cleansing forces, ligands (or adhesins) on the surface of the bacteria interact in a lock-and-key (or induced-fit) fashion with complementary receptors  on mucosal surfaces of the host. the adhesins are usually composed of proteins in the form of fimbriae or fibrillae and the receptors of glycolipids or glycoproteins. in group a streptococci the adhesin, lipoteichoic acid (lta), is anchored to one or more proteins on the surface of the bacterial cells and interacts through its lipid moiety with fibronectin molecules deposited on and bound to the epithelial cells. in an attempt to locate the region of fibronectin  recognized by lta and group a streptococci, fibronectin was cleaved with thermolysin and the fragment mixture adsorbed with staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes. staphylococci adsorbed several high-molecular-weight fragments as well as a 28-kilodalton and a 23-kilodalton fragment, whereas s. pyogenes cells adsorbed only the 28-kilodalton fragment completely. the adsorption of the fragments by s. pyogenes was blocked by lta. antibodies raised  against a synthetic peptide copying the nh2 terminus of fibronectin reacted in a  western blot with the 28-kilodalton fragment; this result indicated that s. pyogenes and its lta react with the nh2-terminal region of fibronectin at a site  distinct from that at which s. aureus reacts. our findings are consistent with the idea that lta mediates the attachment of group a streptococci to fatty acid binding sites of fibronectin deposited on mucosal epithelial cells.

TI  == response of streptococcus pyogenes to therapy with amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid in a mouse model of mixed infection caused by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the response of streptococcus pyogenes to amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (augmentin; beecham group) therapy of a mixed streptococcal-staphylococcal infection was studied in a surgical wound in mice. a superficial wound was produced on the backs of anesthetized mice, and a suture infected with s. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, or a mixed inoculum of both organisms was inserted. oral therapy was started 4 h after infection and continued for 3 days.  both amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were effective in eliminating the streptococci from the pure wound infection. in contrast, amoxicillin failed to eliminate the streptococci from a mixed infection in which a beta-lactamase-producing strain of s. aureus was also present, wound counts reaching 10(7) streptococci per wound by 80 h, whereas amoxicillin-clavulanic acid reduced the count to less than 33 streptococci per wound by 24 h. numbers of s. aureus were also reduced by amoxicillin-clavulanic acid therapy, controlling the infection, whereas amoxicillin was ineffective. also of significance was the  fact that successful therapy was achieved with blood and tissue concentrations of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid of the same order as those measured in humans. these results show that amoxicillin therapy failed to eliminate s. pyogenes from  a wound infection in the presence of a beta-lactamase-producing strain of s. aureus and suggest the potential of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid in the treatment  of mixed bacterial skin infections involving beta-lactamase-producing organisms.

TI  == interactions of fibronectin with streptococci: the role of fibronectin as a receptor for streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == current evidence suggests that lipoteichoic acid (lta) on the surface of streptococcus pyogenes is centrally involved in the adherence of these bacteria to the oral mucosa. the major receptor on the surface of buccal mucosal cells for s. pyogenes is fibronectin. fibronectin is a complex glycoprotein found in blood, extracellular matrices, and saliva. many species of streptococci bind to fibronectin, although the characteristics of these interactions are different. furthermore, whereas lta is an efficient inhibitor of the binding of fibronectin  to group a streptococci, it has little ability to inhibit the binding of fibronectin to streptococcus pneumoniae or staphylococcus aureus. studies conducted with fibronectin show that different bacteria bind to different sites.  the ability of various bacteria to interact with different domains on the fibronectin molecule may play an important role in bacterial adherence and tissue tropism.

AB  == platelet-bacterial interactions were examined in vitro by incubating organisms isolated from patients with septicemia with normal platelet-rich plasma. the potency of various species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to induce  irreversible platelet aggregation was then determined in an aggregometer. the aggregation curves produced by the bacteria resembled the normal platelet response to collagen and were impeded by the presence of aspirin. strains of staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from 25 different patients produced maximum increases in light transmission and irreversible platelet aggregation with relatively rapid mean aggregation times; six of these patients had clinical and laboratory evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. in contrast, isolates of alpha streptococcus and staphylococcus epidermidis induced irreversible platelet aggregation much less commonly and were associated with considerably longer mean aggregation times. none of the latter group of patients had evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. isolates of bacteria from a small number of patients with subacute bacterial endocarditis uniformly induced irreversible platelet aggregation. addition of paired bacterial isolates to normal platelet-rich plasma demonstrated a synergistic aggregation response. these data suggest that a relative hierarchy exists in bacterial strain potency to induce irreversible platelet aggregation. the rapidity and degree of aggregation in vitro correlated well with the clinical and laboratory evidence for subacute bacterial endocarditis and disseminated intravascular coagulation in vivo. these observations may provide useful adjunctive laboratory information to help establish the diagnosis of subacute bacterial endocarditis, especially in the clinical setting where the classical findings of endocarditis are not obvious during initial presentation.

TI  == in vitro activity of a-56268 (te-031), a new macrolide antibiotic, compared with  that of erythromycin and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == a-56268 is a new macrolide antibiotic that resembles erythromycin in its spectrum of activity. a-56268 and erythromycin had identical activities against streptococcus pyogenes, group b, c, and g streptococci, and viridans group streptococci. erythromycin and a-56268 had similar activities against staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and group d enterococci. like erythromycin, a-56268 was ineffective in inhibiting oxacillin-resistant s. aureus, oxacillin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and penicillin-resistant viridans group streptococci. haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and legionella spp. were inhibited by a-56268 at concentrations similar to those of erythromycin.

AB  == 805 clinical isolates were investigated for their in vitro sensitivity against ro 15-8074 and ro 19-5247 in comparison to cefaclor and cefalexin in a serial dilution test on solid medium. ro 19-5247 had the strongest activity of all drugs tested against streptococci (except streptococcus faecalis) and was as active as  cefaclor and cefalexin against most strains of staphylococcus aureus. ro 19-5247  was the only oral cephalosporin active against bordetella pertussis. it was on average 160 times more active than cefaclor against haemophilus influenzae. in its activity against enterobacteria ro 19-5247 was always superior to cefaclor and cefalexin. only a few strains of enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris and serratia marcescens were resistant to ro 19-5247 as were all strains of enterobacter agglomerans and klebsiella ozaenae. ro 15-8074 was inactive against staphylococci but ten times more active than cefaclor and cefalexin against streptococcus pyogenes. there was no difference in the activity against streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus  agalactiae. against haemophilus influenzae ro 15-8074 acted 12 times stronger than cefaclor and 100 times stronger than cefalexin. the activity against enterobacteria corresponded to that of ro 19-5247. ro 15-8074 was also active against most strains of enterobacter cloacae and proteus vulgaris which were resistant to cefaclor and cefalexin.

TI  == specificity study of kits for detection of group a streptococci directly from throat swabs.
AB  == a total of 78 streptococcus strains, 15 staphylococcus strains, and 2 stomatococcus strains were used to test the specificity of 18 different antigen detection systems for group a streptococci and five products that detect a specific enzyme associated with group a streptococci. all streptococcal strains possessing the group a antigen were correctly identified with 31 different lots of reagents in the 18 antigen detection systems. the specificities of the 31 different lots of reagents ranged between 88.5 and 100%. a limited number of nonspecific reactions were observed with enterococcus gallinarium, group c streptococcus strain c23, and staphylococcus aureus f49 and cowan 1. the antigen  detection kits that used enzymes as the extraction reagent gave slightly more specific results than did the kits that used chemical extraction reagents. the reagents in the five kits designed to detect the enzyme pyroglutamic acid arylamidase in streptococcus pyogenes reacted positively with s. pyogenes (group  a streptococcus); however, the reagents also reacted positively with all group d  enterococcal streptococci and with about half of the staphylococcal strains treated. the nonspecificity of tests based on pyroglutamic acid arylamidase detection would seem to limit the usefulness of these kits with mixed cultures.

TI  == a two-center review of bacteremia in the community hospital.
AB  == there are fewer studies on bacteremia coming from the community hospital, where the practicing family physician is likely to see this problem, than from the university hospital. the hypothesis of this study was that patterns of bacteremia would be different between the two types of hospitals. two hundred four patient episodes of culture-proven bacteremia from two analogous community hospitals were reviewed. bacteremia was discovered in 2.6 of 1,000 patients, which is lower than reports from university hospitals. of the 213 organisms isolated, slightly more were gram-negative than gram-positive, whereas many tertiary care centers report  a preponderance of gram-negative organisms. about 20 percent of the episodes of bacteremia ended in death, a rate lower than in many tertiary care centers, and slightly more patients died of gram-negative than gram-positive bacteremia. the most common organisms in descending order were the streptococci and escherichia coli followed by staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus species, and streptococcus pneumoniae. the most common sources of bacteremia were, in decreasing order, urinary tract, source unknown, heart valve, and lung. the most  common underlying disorders were, in decreasing order, malignancy, diabetes mellitus, complicated urinary tract infection, valvular heart disease, and postoperative infection. correctness of treatment of bacteremia appeared to increase survival.

AB  == immunologic cross-reactivity between streptococcus pyogenes type a exotoxin (erythrogenic toxin) and staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins b and c1 was demonstrated by ouchterlony double diffusion, western immunoblot, and immunodot analyses. specific antiserum to type a streptococcal exotoxin reacted more strongly with staphylococcal enterotoxin b than with enterotoxin c1. the reactivity of type a streptococcal exotoxin with antiserum to staphylococcal enterotoxin b was greater than that of antiserum to enterotoxin c1. these results suggest that a conserved domain is present in the three exotoxins, which most likely originated from a common evolutionary ancestor.

AB  == three different bioassay methods for rokitamycin (tms-19-q) were compared to each other in vitro and in vivo. method i was a paper disc method using micrococcus luteus atcc 9341 as the test organism in nutrient agar (ph 8.0), method ii was a  paper disc method using streptococcus pyogenes cook in brain heart infusion agar  (ph 7.4) and method iii was an agar well method using m. luteus atcc 9341 in the  agar medium provided in the minimum requirements for antibiotic products of japan (ph 6.5). ratios of relative potency of tms-19-q and its metabolites calculated from standard curves in human plasma using these bioassay methods, were 1.00:1.13:3.34:0.96 (tms-19-q:10"-oh-tms-19-q:lm a7:lm v) in method i, 1.00:1.58:0.40 (tms-19-q:lm a7:lm v) in method ii and 1.00:0.51:0.86:0.114 (tms-19-q:10"-oh-tms-19-q:lm a7:lm v) in method iii. the relative potency obtained from method i, generally used for macrolide antibiotics, greatly contradicted mic values of tms-19-q and its metabolites against clinically isolated 190 strains of staphylococcus aureus. on the other hand, the relative potency obtained from method iii reflected closely mic values of tms-19-q and its metabolites. therefore, method iii should be the most suitable bioassay method to measure the plasma concentration of tms-19-q. plasma concentrations measured by these 3 different methods were compared to each other in vivo, after oral administration of tms-19-q at a dose of 1,200 mg to each of fasted healthy volunteers. values obtained from method i were about 4.3 times higher than those  method iii.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == activation of the human complement cascade by bacterial cell walls, peptidoglycans, water-soluble peptidoglycan components, and synthetic muramylpeptides--studies on active components and structural requirements.
AB  == cell walls isolated from 29 strains of 24 gram-positive bacterial species, whose  peptidoglycans belong to the group a type of schleifer and kandler's classification, with one exception (arthrobacter sp.), were shown to activate the complement cascade in pooled fresh human serum mainly through the alternative pathway and partly through the classical one. the complement-activating effect of cell walls (5 species) possessing group b type peptidoglycan, except those of corynebacterium insidiosum, was weaker than that of the walls with group a type peptidoglycan. preparations of peptidoglycan isolated from cell walls of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and lactobacillus plantarum also activated the alternative pathway of the complement cascade, but less effectively than the respective parent cell walls. a water-soluble "polymer" of peptidoglycan subunits (seps), which was prepared from staphylococcus epidermidis peptidoglycans by treatment with a cross-bridge degrading endopeptidase, retained most of the complement-activating ability of the parent cell walls. a peptidoglycan "monomer," seps-m, which was obtained by hydrolysis of the glycan chain of seps with endo-n-acetylmuramidase to disaccharide units did not activate complement. in conformity with this finding, neither synthetic n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-isoglutamine (mdp) nor mdp-l-lys-d-ala activated the complement cascade. among several lipophilic derivatives of mdp, 6-o-(3-hydroxy-3-docosylhexacosanoyl)-mdp-l-lys-d-ala (bh48-mdp-l-lys-d-ala) and  6-o-(2-tetradecylhexadecanoyl)-mdp (b30-mdp) were shown to activate complement through the alternative as well as the classical pathway and exclusively through  the classical pathway, respectively. the finding that a d-isoasparagine analog of b30-mdp caused the same effect as the parent molecule strongly suggests that the  activation of complement by b30-mdp is different from that caused by cell wall peptidoglycans and a water-soluble "polymer" of peptidoglycan subunits.

TI  == synthesis and antimicrobial activity of a series of caespitin derivatives.
AB  == chemical modification of the naturally occurring phlorophenone antimicrobial agent caespitin is described. these modifications include variations in the phenone side chain, substitution with prenyl, allyl, and benzyl in the 4-position of the phlorophenone nucleus, and ring cyclizations via etherification to give furan and chroman compounds. several of these derivatives show enhanced in vitro  potency over caespitin. studies on the development of microbial resistance against these compounds show that no or very little resistance developed after several passes of these compounds in representative microbial strains.

TI  == scrum kidney: epidemic pyoderma caused by a nephritogenic streptococcus pyogenes  in a rugby team.
AB  == in december, 1984, an outbreak of pyoderma affected five scrum players in the st  thomas' hospital rugby team. the causative organism, streptococcus pyogenes, was  acquired during a match against a team experiencing an outbreak of impetigo, and  was transmitted to two front row players of another team a week later, and to two girlfriends of affected st thomas' players a month later. the strain was m-type 49, tetracycline-resistant, and virulent. it caused salpingitis in a girlfriend and acute glomerulonephritis in one rugby player. no case of subclinical glomerulonephritis was detected in eight patients with pyoderma. screening of the st thomas' hospital team revealed four further cases of non-streptococcal skin infection, with evidence for contemporaneous spread of staphylococcus aureus. teams should not field players with sepsis, and it may be advisable to apply a skin antiseptic to traumatised skin after the match.

AB  == the in vitro activity of erythromycin against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae was examined by agar dilution and agar diffusion methods. the plates were incubated in air alone or in 8% co2 and air. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) measured in air alone were lower for most of the isolates, compared to those found in 8% co2. the greatest differences in mic values were found for h. influenzae; the mic 50% was 0.5 mg/l in air and 4 mg/l in 8% co2. sensitivity testing by the agar diffusion method (ics) showed considerable differences between results obtained in air and in 8% co2; the inhibition zones were generally smaller in co2. the most marked reduction in zone sizes after incubation in 8% co2 was seen with the h. influenzae isolates; 15 out of 43 isolates moved from the "sensitive" to "moderately sensitive" group. sensitivity determination of aerobic bacteria for erythromycin should be performed in air alone in the routine laboratory.

AB  == the in vitro activity of coumermycin has been compared with those of ampicillin,  clindamycin, cloxacillin, doxycycline, erythromycin, netilmicin, penicillin g and vancomycin. a total of 251 clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci were examined. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined by an agar dilution method. clindamycin, coumermycin and erythromycin were the most active drugs against staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis on a weight-for-weight basis. all the staphylococcal isolates were inhibited by coumermycin at a concentration of 0.12 mg/l or less. netilmicin seemed to be somewhat more active  against s. epidermidis than against s. aureus. the mics of vancomycin for the staphylococcal isolates were clustered around 1 mg/l. streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae were highly susceptible to penicillin g and erythromycin; most isolates were inhibited by 0.03 mg/l or less of either drug. coumermycin showed poor activity against s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae and enterococci. most of the s. pneumoniae isolates had also high mics, although a wide range of sensitivities was found.

TI  == isolation and partial characterization of a type ii fc receptor from a group a streptococcus.
AB  == a group a streptococcal strain rich in fc receptors was selected by an immunoblotting technique and used as the source for isolation of a functionally active fc receptor. a variety of extraction techniques were compared including (1) heat extraction at neutral, acid or alkaline ph, (2) treatment with the enzymes mutanolysin, hyaluronidase, trypsin, papain or phage lysin, or (3) autoclaving or heating in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. the most homogeneous receptor was recovered following heat extraction and contained two molecular weight forms. the major form had a molecular weight of 56 000 daltons and the minor form had a molecular weight of 38 000 daltons. these two proteins could be isolated without loss of activity by binding to and elution from a column of immobilized human igg. an antibody prepared against a single form of the affinity purified receptor demonstrated reactivity with both molecular weight forms of the heat extracted receptor. the group a receptor was found to be both antigenically and physicochemically distinct from either the type i receptor found on the majority of staphylococcus aureus strains or the type iii fc receptors found on the majority of group c streptococcal strains.

AB  == a-56619 and a-56620 are two new aryl-fluoroquinolones which are as potent as or more potent than norfloxacin when administered orally and subcutaneously in mouse protection tests against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae. a-56619 and a-56620 were more potent than norfloxacin when administered orally against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. a-56620 was as potent or two- to threefold more potent than norfloxacin when administered subcutaneously against members of the family enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. infection with salmonella typhimurium was more effectively treated with a-56619 (50% effective dose [ed50], 1.4 mg/kg per day) than with norfloxacin (ed50, 62.8 mg/kg per day). e. coli or pseudomonas pyelonephritis in mice was more effectively treated with a-56619 or a-56620 than with norfloxacin. after oral treatment, the  ed50s of a-56619 and a-56620 were less than 12.5 mg/kg per day against e. coli and 62.9 and 38 mg/kg per day against p. aeruginosa pyelonephritis, respectively. norfloxacin was ineffective at 200 mg/kg per day against e. coli or p. aeruginosa pyelonephritis. a-56619 and a-56620 were also more potent than norfloxacin in treatment of mixed bacterial pyelonephritis caused by e. coli and streptococcus faecalis. a-56619 was at least 30 times more potent than norfloxacin and a-56620  was 4 to 11 times more potent than norfloxacin when administered against klebsiella pneumonia in mice. a-56619 and a-56620 were at least 2 to 10 times more potent than norfloxacin against staphylococcus aureus infections in immunosuppressed mice. a-56619 was equally potent in all in vivo tests when administered orally or subcutaneously, whereas a-56620 was similar to norfloxacin in being more potent when administered subcutaneously. the peak serum levels after subcutaneous and oral administration of a-56619 and a-56620 were higher than that of norfloxacin. the serum hal-lives of a-56619 and a-56620 after subcutaneous and oral administration were longer than the serum half-life of norfloxacin.

AB  == groups a, c and g streptococci were tested for their ability to bind 125i-labelled fragments of human and rabbit igg in order to localize their sites  of interaction with igg domains. among the group a streptococci, strains with igg fc receptors bound 85% of the added igg fc fragments in the test systems, whereas these strains showed practically no reactivity with f(ab')2, facb (f(ab')2 + c gamma 2 domains) or pfc' (c gamma 3 domains). the group c and group g strains bound 48-100% of igg fc, but could also bind up to 36% of the added f(ab')2 in accordance with a previously described 'alternative' fab reactivity. however, unlabelled igg f(ab')2 or facb showed no, or only slight, inhibitory capacity for the binding of 125i-labelled igg fc to the c and g strains. collectively, these results indicate that groups a, c and g streptococci require both the c gamma 2 and c gamma 3 domains for interaction with igg, and most probably also bind in the interface region between the c gamma 2 and c gamma 3 domains as has been shown for staphylococcal protein a.

TI  == release of fibronectin-lipoteichoic acid complexes from group a streptococci with penicillin.
AB  == fibronectin binds to streptococcus pyogenes, and this binding is inhibited by lipoteichoic acid (lta). previous studies have shown that lta can be released from s. pyogenes by treatment with penicillin. penicillin released lta from both  s. pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus; however, the binding of fibronectin correlated with the amount of lta released only in the case of s. pyogenes. contrarily, clindamycin decreased the ability of s. aureus to bind fibronectin without affecting the binding of fibronectin to s. pyogenes. further studies indicated that lta does not inhibit the binding of fibronectin to s. aureus. fibronectin bound to s. pyogenes could be released from the cell surface by penicillin. immunological analysis of the released fibronectin indicated that lta was the only surface component which could be detected as a soluble complex with  the released fibronectin. these studies suggest that lta plays a central role in  the binding of fibronectin to s. pyogenes and is not involved in the binding of fibronectin to s. aureus.

TI  == current state and tendencies of antibiotic resistance in hungary.
AB  == this survey is based on data for 245 903 isolates reported by public health network laboratories in 1983. facultatively pathogenic gram-negative bacteria comprised two-third of the isolates, and--except escherichia coli--were resistant in a high percent to the most frequently used antibiotics. oxacillin and vancomycin were the most effective against staphylococcus aureus being in 94.7% resistant to penicillin. in contrast to other streptococci, all streptococcus pyogenes strains were sensitive to penicillin. the majority of the gram-positive  strains were resistant to tetracycline. a comparison to results reported earlier  (1974 to 1983) showed an increasing resistance rate mainly to ampicillin, carbenicillin, co-trimoxazole and gentamicin, which were introduced in therapy during this period. resistance rate of almost all species has increased to gentamicin, e.g. that of proteus mirabilis has risen tenfold. emergence of haemophilus influenzae resistant to ampicillin, and increasing resistance rates of p. mirabilis and streptococcus pneumoniae to almost all drugs are remarkable findings. the increasing or variable usage of drugs that have been used for a long time did not influence resistance markedly. in some instances the resistance rates even diminished, e.g. the tetracycline resistance of agents associated with enteric diseases. a restricted use of chloramphenicol reflected in a decreased resistance of some species. multiresistant gram-negative strains--which are resistant to all drugs frequently used in hungary--were isolated in 12.7% from a  representative clinical material. the frequent occurrence of multiresistant p. mirabilis and acinetobacter isolates is a new phenomenon. surprisingly, the percentage of multiresistant e. coli strains was very low. amikacin and netilmicin were found to be the most effective against multiresistant isolates.

AB  == using haemolysis in gel, two bacterial igg-binding substances, an fc-receptor isolated from group a streptococci type m15, and protein a from staphylococcus aureus, were shown to inhibit complement-mediated lysis of sheep erythrocytes sensitized with rabbit igg. when the crude alkaline extracts of ten types of group a streptococci were tested to see whether streptococcal components other than fc-binding material might affect lysis, the degree of inhibition was found to be correlated with fc-binding activity. in no case was the lysis of igm-coated cells inhibited. opsonophagocytosis experiments showed that both purified streptococcal fc-receptor and protein a impaired antibody complement-dependent killing by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes of each of two strains of group b streptococci (lacking igg fc-receptors). furthermore, the impairment was ascribable to interference with the fixation of complement to the antibodies, as  demonstrated in pre-opsonization experiments with one of the strains. our results suggest that blocking of the binding of complement to igg is an important virulence mechanism in fc-receptor-bearing streptococci and staphylococci.

AB  == a controlled, randomized study to compare the efficacy and safety of ticarcillin  plus clavulanic acid with moxalactam was carried out in 25 evaluable patients with bone, joint, and skin or skin structure infections. of the 13 patients in the ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid-treated group, nine had osteomyelitis, two had septic arthritis, one had cellulitis, and one had a wound infection. four of  the 12 moxalactam-treated patients had osteomyelitis, one had septic arthritis, and the other seven had cellulitis and/or infected ulcers. a total of 21 causative organisms were isolated in the group treated with ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid: enterobacteriaceae (10), pseudomonas aeruginosa (five), obligate anaerobes (three), staphylococcus aureus (two), and acinetobacter species (one).  cultures in the moxalactam-treated group yielded 23 pathogens: enterobacteriaceae (seven), s. aureus (six), group b streptococci (four), p. aeruginosa (two), obligate anaerobes (two), streptococcus pyogenes (one), and aeromonas species (one). a cure or satisfactory response was achieved in 12 of the 13 (92 percent)  patients who received ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid and in 10 of the 12 (83 percent) patients who received moxalactam. one patient with septic arthritis who  received ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid had a relapse during therapy, as did one moxalactam-treated patient with a post-surgical wound infection. the other patient in whom moxalactam treatment failed had a wound infection that became reinfected. some abnormalities in laboratory parameters occurred in each group, but none was severe enough to warrant discontinuation of treatment.

TI  == further studies on thymidine kinase: distribution pattern of the enzyme in bacteria.
AB  == various micro-organisms (131 strains of 73 species) were studied for their ability to produce thymidine kinase (tk; ec 2.7.1.21). taking the specific tk activity of escherichia coli k12 [specific activity of sonicated cell extracts 95-194 pmol min-1 (mg protein)-1] as 100%, the test organisms had the following relative specific tk activities. in the gram-positive cocci, staphylococcus aureus (21-84%) showed higher activity than staph. epidermidis (1-20%) and streptococcus (1-7%) except for one strain of strep. pyogenes (29%). neisseria sicca, a gram-negative coccus, lacked tk. gram-positive endospore-forming rods showed significant activity (bacillus, 13-51%; clostridium perfringens, 9-18%) except for one strain of b. megaterium (2%) and c. difficile (1-3%). among the gram-positive asporogenous rods, listeria monocytogenes and six species of lactobacillus (especially l. brevis, l. buchneri and l. casei) had moderate to high activity (23-348%) but l. acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. lactis and l. cellobiosus had low activity (0-8%). of the species of pseudomonas studied, most  lacked tk but ps. fluorescens and ps. maltophilia had significant tk activity (15-53%). of the gram-negative facultative anaerobes, vibrio lacked tk, while enterobacteriaceae, including salmonella (148-1120%), escherichia (59-141%), klebsiella (78-299%) and serratia (61-110%), had a high activity. proteus had a somewhat lower activity (0-34%) except for 'pr. rettgerella' (307%). propionibacterium and bifidobacterium and related organisms other than streptomyces, nocardia, rhodococcus, corynebacterium and mycobacterium lacked tk. the seven species of candida tested, and cryptococcus neoformans, essentially lacked tk.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == antimicrobial activity of aridicins, novel glycopeptide antibiotics with high and prolonged levels in blood.
AB  == three new glycopeptide antibiotics, aridicins a, b, and c, produced by kibdelosporangium aridum have a spectrum of antimicrobial activity in vitro which is similar to that of vancomycin. the antimicrobial activities of these glycopeptides against clinical bacterial isolates were compared with those of vancomycin and other related glycopeptide antibiotics in vitro by agar dilution and microtiter broth dilution tests and in vivo in mouse protection studies. in vitro they were somewhat less effective than vancomycin against strains of staphylococcus aureus and less active against coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. however, they were more active than vancomycin against strains of streptococcus faecalis and markedly superior to vancomycin and other glycopeptide antibiotics against strains of clostridium difficile. in experimental infections, aridicin a was effective against strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pyogenes, although its 50% effective doses were higher than those of vancomycin when administered after infection. after subcutaneous administration, aridicin a had a higher peak level in serum and a longer half-life than vancomycin or teicoplanin. the aridicins were markedly superior to vancomycin when administered prior to infection in mouse protection tests, indicating long-acting potential.

TI  == imipenem/cilastatin for the treatment of infections in hospitalized children.
AB  == imipenem is the first of a new class of beta-lactam antimicrobial agents with potent in vitro activity against most bacterial pathogens that cause infections in children. we studied, prospectively, the clinical efficacy and toxicity of imipenem/cilastatin in 40 children with proved or suspected bacterial infection.  a dose of 100 mg/kg/day of imipenem was given to children younger than 3 years of age, while children older than 3 years of age received 60 mg/kg/day. twenty-nine  organisms were isolated from 26 patients. infections treated included cellulitis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, lymphadenitis, renal infections, wound infections, and pneumonia. bacteria isolated included staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. all patients responded favorably to treatment, with defervescence and improvement of  symptoms. all of the infecting bacteria were susceptible to imipenem. imipenem/cilastatin was well tolerated, with no serious side effects, and appeared to be an effective and safe antimicrobial agent in the treatment of the  population studied.

TI  == are the tonsils and adenoids a reservoir of infection in otitis media with effusion (glue ear)?
AB  == in a prospective investigation of the treatment of glue ear in children, the possible role of persistent infection in the tonsils and adenoids was assessed by comparing bacterial cultures of swabs and resected tissue from the tonsils and adenoids of patients with cultures of swabs from similar sites in control subjects without ent abnormality. for almost all potential pathogens, including streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, no statistically significant differences were demonstrated between patients and controls. the same was true of streptococcus pyogenes in tonsil specimens, while in adenoid specimens rather more isolates were obtained in patients than controls. this difference was just statistically significant at the 5% level, but only when all isolations, including very scanty growths, were compared. on present evidence, persistent infection should not be invoked to explain the success of adenoidectomy in otitis media with effusion or to justify adenotonsillectomy.

TI  == attachment of staphylococci and streptococci on fibronectin, fibronectin fragments, and fibrinogen bound to a solid phase.
AB  == the attachment of staphylococcus aureus (cowan i) and two strains of group a and  g streptococci on glass cover slips coated with fibronectin, fibronectin fragments, or fibrinogen was studied. the attachment was quantitated by counting  the attached bacteria on glass surfaces coated with a similar molarity of the proteins. fibronectin was a more effective attachment factor than fibrinogen for  staphylococci, while group g streptococci attached better on fibrinogen- than on  fibronectin-coated cover slips. in this system, group a streptococci bound almost exclusively to substrate-bound fibrinogen. attachment experiments involving the use of staphylococci pretreated with soluble fibronectin or fibrinogen revealed that bacterium-bound fibronectin and fibrinogen were able to enhance the adherence on cover slips coated with fibronectin. the 30-kilodalton nh2-terminal  and the 120- to 140-kilodalton cooh-terminal fragments of fibronectin, both of which contain bacterial binding sites, mediated the staphylococcal attachment, suggesting that both parts of the molecule are involved in the attachment mediated by fibronectin.

TI  == antibacterial properties of lidocaine on bacteria isolated from dermal lesions.
AB  == we studied the antibacterial properties of lidocaine and lidocaine with methylparaben, employing bacteria that were isolated from dermal lesions. our study was significant because local anesthetics utilized before obtaining material for biopsy and/or culture may result in false-negative results. killing  curves were calculated to ascertain exposure times of bacteria to various concentrations of lidocaine with and without methylparaben that could affect recovery of viable bacteria from clinical specimens. the bacteria studied varied  greatly in their susceptibility to lidocaine, with neisseria species being the most sensitive. greater inhibitory activity was noted against bacteria when methylparaben was present. our study suggests that lower concentrations of lidocaine without methylparaben should be employed.

TI  == survival of herpes simplex virus and other selected microorganisms on patient charts: potential source of infection.
AB  == this study indicated that when inoculated onto dental charts, both viruses and bacteria were capable of survival allowing the potential for transmission of infection within the dental office. the conscientious dental practitioner can take steps to reduce this possible mode of infection by removing contaminated surgical gloves or washing hands before handling the chart. an additional method  of reducing this potential would be to wipe the chart with an antiseptic solution. although this study has shown that there is a potential for the spread  of infection with the organisms tested, the actual extent of dental chart contamination and resultant illnesses contracted are the basis for further study. additional studies are needed to follow the pattern of chart distribution from person to person within the dental office, determine the types and quantities of  pathogens present in the mouth that would contaminate the charts, and sample the  charts under actual clinical conditions to determine the types and viability of the organisms present.

TI  == streptococcal phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system: purification  and characterization of a phosphoprotein phosphatase which hydrolyzes the phosphoryl bond in seryl-phosphorylated histidine-containing protein.
AB  == histidine-containing protein (hpr) of gram-positive bacteria was found to be phosphorylated at a seryl residue (p-ser-hpr) in an atp-dependent reaction catalyzed by a protein kinase (j. deutscher and m. h. saier, jr., proc. natl. acad. sci. u.s.a. 80:6790-6794, 1983). here we describe the purification and characterization of a soluble enzyme of streptococcus faecalis which splits the phosphoryl bond in p-ser-hpr. the enzyme has a molecular weight of ca. 7.5 x 10(4), as determined by its migration behavior on a sephacryl s-200 column. on native polyacrylamide gels the purified enzyme produced only one protein band. on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels we found one major protein band of molecular weight 2.9 x 10(4) and two minor protein bands of molecular weights 2.3 x 10(4) and 7 x 10(4). fructose 1,6-diphosphate, which stimulated the atp-dependent, protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of hpr, had no effect on  the phosphatase activity. other glycolytic intermediates also had no effect. however, inorganic phosphate, which inhibited the atp-dependent hpr kinase, stimulated the p-ser-hpr phosphatase. edta at a concentration of 0.1 mm completely inhibited the phosphatase. divalent cations like mg2+, mn2+, and co2+  overcame the inhibition by edta. fe2+, zn2+, and cu2+ had no effect, whereas ca2+ slightly inhibited the phosphatase. atp was also found to inhibit the phosphatase. under conditions in which atp severely inhibited the phosphatase, adp was found to have no effect on the enzyme activity. besides p-ser-hpr of s. faecalis, the phosphatase was also able to hydrolyze the phosphoryl bond in p-ser-hpr of streptococcus lactis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes, and lactobacillus casei. phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside phosphorylation, catalyzed by the s. aureus phosphoenolpyruvate:lactose phosphotransferase system, was about 150-fold  decreased in the presence of p-ser-hpr of s. aureus, as compared with hpr. however, when p-ser-hpr was first incubated with p-ser-hpr phosphatase to allow complete hydrolysis of the phosphoryl bond, it had the same activity as hpr. besides this cytoplasmic phosphoprotein phosphatase, we detected a membrane-bound phosphatase which also hydrolyzed the phosphoryl bond in p-ser-hpr.

TI  == presence of laminin receptors in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == a characteristic feature of infection by staphylococcus aureus is bloodstream invasion and widespread metastatic abscess formation. the ability to extravasate, which entails crossing the vascular basement membrane, appears to be critical for the organism's pathogenicity. extravasation by normal and neoplastic mammalian cells has been correlated with the presence of specific cell surface receptors for the basement membrane glycoprotein laminin. similar laminin receptors were found in staphylococcus aureus but not in staphylococcus epidermidis, a noninvasive pathogen. there were about 100 binding sites per cell, with an apparent binding affinity of 2.9 nanomolar. the molecular weight of the receptor  was 50,000 and pi was 4.2. eukaryotic laminin receptors were visualized by means  of the binding of s. aureus in the presence of laminin. prokaryotic and eukaryotic invasive cells might utilize similar, if not identical, mechanisms for invasion.

TI  == extracellular matrix proteins (fibronectin, laminin, and type iv collagen) bind and aggregate bacteria.
AB  == the normal microbial colonization of sites in the body's tissues by certain bacteria requires that the bacteria first bind to extracellular secreted constituents, cell-surface membranes, or cell matrixes. this study examines two interactions of a variety of bacteria with the cell matrix noncollagenous proteins fibronectin and laminin and with basement membrane (type iv) collagen. adherence of bacteria to matrix proteins coated on tissue culture wells was examined with the use of radiolabeled bacteria. staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus sanguis bound well to fibronectin, laminin, and type iv collagen, whereas a variety of gram-negative organisms did not bind. the interaction of soluble laminin, fibronectin, and type iv collagen with bacteria was monitored by nephelometry with the use of a platelet aggregometer. s. aureus aggregated in response to fibronectin, laminin, or type iv collagen. in contrast, gram-negative organisms did not aggregate with these proteins. it appears that fibronectin, laminin, and type iv collagen can bind and aggregate certain gram-positive bacteria, and this binding is dependent on the surface characteristics of the organism. these adhesion molecules may play a role in the normal colonization of sites by microorganisms and in invasion during infections.

TI  == suppression of lymphocyte proliferation by pseudomonas aeruginosa: mediation by pseudomonas-activated suppressor monocytes.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa has been shown to suppress cell-mediated immunity in experimental animals, but recent reports have also demonstrated that there is a strong t-cell response to this bacteria. our studies of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed a great variation in the in vitro proliferative response to killed p. aeruginosa, so we examined the interaction of the different mononuclear cells in cultures with this bacteria. p. aeruginosa stimulated the proliferation of t lymphocytes, specifically the surface-immunoglobulin-negative, t8- subset, which are felt to be t helper cells. p. aeruginosa added in coculture experiments to peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with staphylococcus  aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, or tetanus toxoid suppressed the proliferation to these latter antigens. this proliferation was not affected by the depletion of adherent monocytes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and the suppression was restored when monocytes were added back to these cultures. moreover, monocytes pulsed with p. aeruginosa but not with s. aureus suppressed the antigen-induced proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. this monocyte suppression was not inhibited by indomethacin and was unlikely to be the result of prostaglandin synthesis by these cells. thus, p. aeruginosa can induce  monocytes to suppress antigen-stimulated t-lymphocyte proliferation in vitro, and these suppressor cells may facilitate the growth of this organism in disorders such as cystic fibrosis.

AB  == monoclonal antibodies were used to determine the number and molecular form of c3  bound to particulate activators of the complement (c) system by human serum. sheep erythrocytes (e) coated with igm (eigm) and igg (eigg) were used to study activation of the classical pathway (cp). yeast (y), rabbit erythrocytes (er), and five species of bacteria (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae type 3, streptococcus pyogenes, and hemophilus influenzae type b) were used to study activation of the alternative pathway (ap). the deposition of c3b onto eigm and eigg incubated in c7-deficient human serum was dependent on the serum concentration. at all serum concentrations tested, there was complete conversion of c3b to ic3b. kinetic analysis of c3b deposition  and conversion to ic3b indicated that these events occurred almost simultaneously; the reaction was completed by 15 min. the deposition of c3 onto the ap activators er and y was also dependent on serum concentration, and er, but not y, required the presence of mg-egta and thus the activation of only the ap. c3b deposition and conversion to ic3b on y was complete in 15 min, with 82% of bound c3 converted to ic3b. for er, maximum c3 deposition required 30 min in both the presence and absence of mg-egta. however, after 1 h of incubation, 74% of bound c2 was ic3b in the absence of mg-egta, compared with only 52% in the presence of mg-egta. thus, even on ap activators, a large portion of c3b may be converted to ic3b, and this conversion is probably controlled by elements on the  particle's surface. studies with the five species of bacteria yielded similar results. approximately 3-5 x 10(4) molecules of c3 were bound per microorganism,  with opsonization being completed in 30 min. remarkably, only 16-28% of bound c3  was in the form of ic3b, even after 2 h of incubation. the presence or absence of mg-egta, or the addition of purified cr1 to the reaction mixture, did not significantly effect the ratio of c3b to ic3b. finally, sds-page and autoradiography of particle-bound 125i-c3 fragments confirmed that there was no conversion of ic3b to c3d,g or c3d. the data obtained about the opsonization of bacteria suggest that the predominant form of c3 that is encountered by inflammatory phagocytes may be c3b.

TI  == the value of bacteriology and serology in the diagnosis of cellulitis and erysipelas.
AB  == patients diagnosed as suffering from erysipelas or cellulitis were subjected to bacteriological and serological investigations. the serological tests used included the anti-streptolysin o reaction (aso), the anti-deoxyribonuclease b test (adb) and the anti-hyaluronidase tests (aht) that are specific both for the  group a streptococcus (streptococcus pyogenes) and for the human pyogenic streptococci of group c or group g. antibody tests to the alpha-lysin and the nuclease of staphylococcus aureus were also employed. conventional bacteriological culture methods were used plus needle aspiration of injected saline in most patients with erysipelas, but recognized pathogens were isolated in only 42% of cases. our results indicate the limitations of these tests for making initial diagnoses and deciding treatment. serial serological testing was very successful in differentiating cellulitis due to group a, c or g haemolytic streptococci, or occasionally staphylococcus aureus, but was positive in only 40% of cases of erysipelas.

TI  == clinical value of paired sputum and transtracheal aspirates in the initial management of pneumonia.
AB  == one hundred young adults with acute pneumonia were prospectively studied to determine the impact of the transtracheal aspiration (tta) gram stain on immediate management. sputum and tta interpretations by staff and housestaff were compared. after a management plan was elected based on sputum gram stain interpretation, the tta was evaluated and the final plan chosen. a change in treatment after the tta was available occurred in eight cases, and this was an appropriate change in only five. the putative pathogen as identified by tta culture was correctly predicted after sputum gram stain interpretation in 36 to 62 percent of cases and after tta interpretation in 37 to 62 percent. this indicates significant observer variation but not superiority of one type of specimen over the other. in most cases, paired sputum and tta gram stain were both read correctly or incorrectly. when differences occurred, sputum interpretations were as likely to be correct as were tta interpretations. the tta gram stain offered no advantage over sputum gram stain in the initial management  of acute pneumonia in this young adult military population.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of ym-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. the compound was highly active against the common members of the enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. ym-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against citrobacter freundii, proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, providencia rettgeri, and providencia stuartii. the activity of ym-13115 against pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. against haemophilus influenzae ym-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. ym-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. the concentrations of ym-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78  and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit streptococcus faecalis. ym-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. ym-13115 is extremely active  against p. aeruginosa and members of the enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == effect of antibiotics eliminated by first order kinetics.
AB  == we wanted to simulate the conditions within the body where bacteria are exposed to antibiotics at concentrations which diminish exponentially and thus do not remain constant as in the usual test systems for determination of the minimum inhibitory or bactericidal concentrations (mic, mbc). for this purpose we employed a model with a glass chamber containing a constant volume of culture which was supplied continuously with medium at a constant rate. we studied the pattern of bacterial response using a series of bactericidal and bacteriostatic agents added to the system at various multiples of the mic of several bacterial strains, and using different rates of elimination of the antibacterial agent. strains of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pyogenes were exposed to amoxicillin, ampicillin, benzylpenicillin, carbenicillin, cefazolin, chloramphenicol, flucloxacillin, gentamicin, or oxytetracyclin. the bacteria were killed or maintained at their initial density depending on the antibiotic and its concentration. the main findings were: for most drugs drop in bacterial number persisted while the concentration of the chamber remained above mic, a period of time elapsed before recovery and bacterial multiplication resumed at the same rate as in control cultures, the period of antibacterial postantibiotic effect lasted longer with gram-positive than with gram-negative species, the point in time when the bacteria resumed multiplication corresponded to the ic50. we observed only minor differences in the pattern of bacteria during exposure to potentially bactericidal agents compared to antibiotics with mainly bacteriostatic effects.

TI  == bordetella adenylate cyclase: host toxicity and diagnostic utility.
AB  == two toxins from bordetella pertussis, pertussis toxin and bordetella adenylate cyclase, cause profound disruptions of camp metabolism in mammalian cells. while  the role of each toxin in the whooping cough syndrome is unknown, it is highly likely that together they confer on the organism an important proliferative advantage. intact b. pertussis cells express large amounts of adenylate cyclase activity on their exterior surface. in a presently unknown fashion, this enzyme can enter human phagocytes, elevate cellular camp and impair host defense. we reasoned that this unusual enzyme might serve to signal the presence of b. pertussis in nasopharyngeal swabs from infected persons. here we report a series  of in vitro experiments which confirm the feasibility of such an approach. we find that calcium alginate swabs containing as few as 100 b. pertussis organisms  produce readily detectable amounts of camp in our assay. nasopharyngeal secretions swabbed from healthy volunteers, however produced no detectable camp alone and did not affect the production of camp by b. pertussis. we have also tested pure cultures of four common bacterial pathogens (haemophilus influenzae,  streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli) which may be co-isolated in clinical whooping cough and find that none interferes with the detection of b. pertussis. we conclude that the unique adenylate cyclase of b. pertussis might be a valuable diagnostic device.

TI  == mode of action and in-vitro activity of vancomycin.
AB  == vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. it also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. there is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits  ribonucleic acid synthesis. induction of bacterial l-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. stable l-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to  vancomycin. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant  strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), str. pyogenes, str. agalactiae, str. bovis, str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species and lactobacillus species. there has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against staph. aureus, str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. the combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of staph. epidermidis. it shows indifference against enterococci. vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against staph. aureus.

TI  == a new approach for presumptive identification of clinically important streptococci.
AB  == several tests, bacitracin, camp, pyroglutamic acid-b-naphthylamide test (pyr test), bile aesculin hydrolysis, salt tolerance and pigment production tests were evaluated for their reliability and speed in presumptive identification of streptococci. bacitracin correctly identified all of the group a streptococci but 5% of other beta haemolytic streptococci were misidentified as group a. the pyr reaction was just as sensitive but more specific for group a streptococci and the results were available within 2-3 h. the pyr reaction also effectively differentiated between enterococcal and non-enterococcal group d streptococci. both the salt tolerance test and the pyr reaction misidentified bile aesculin positive non-group d streptococci as non-enterococcal group d streptococci. pigment production by group b streptococci was more reliable than the camp test for identifying group b streptococci. the combination of pyr, bile aesculin and pigment production allowed rapid differentiation of several medically important groups of streptococci.

TI  == properties of atp-dependent protein kinase from streptococcus pyogenes that phosphorylates a seryl residue in hpr, a phosphocarrier protein of the phosphotransferase system.
AB  == transport of sugars across the cytoplasmic membranes of gram-positive bacteria appears to be regulated by the action of a metabolite-activated, atp-dependent protein kinase that phosphorylates a seryl residue in the phosphocarrier protein  of the phosphotransferase system, hpr. we have developed a quantitative assay for measuring the activity of this enzyme from streptococcus pyogenes. the product of the in vitro protein kinase-catalyzed reaction was shown to be phosphoseryl-hpr by several independent criteria (rates of hydrolysis in the presence of various agents, detection of serine-phosphate in acid hydrolysates, immunological assay,  and electrophoretic migration rates). hprs isolated from four different gram-positive bacteria (s. pyogenes, streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus subtilis) were shown to be phosphorylated by the kinase from s. pyogenes. in contrast, escherichia coli hpr was not a substrate of this enzyme. the soluble kinase released from the particulate fraction of the cells with high salt in the presence of a protease inhibitor was shown to have an approximate molecular weight of 60,000 as estimated by gel filtration. its activity was dependent on divalent cations, with mg2+ and mn2+ being most active. edta, pi, and high concentrations of salt were strongly inhibitory. the enzyme was optimally active at ph 7.0, exhibited high affinity for its substrates, and was dependent on the presence of one of several metabolites. of these compounds,  fructose 1-6-diphosphate was most active, with gluconate 6-phosphate, 2-phosphoglycerate, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, phosphoenolpyruvate, and pyruvate exhibiting moderate to low stimulatory activities. other compounds tested, including a variety of sugar phosphates, pyridine nucleotides, and other metabolites were without effect. the atp-dependent phosphorylation of hpr on the  seryl residue was strongly inhibited by phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of the active histidyl residue of this protein. treatment of the  kinase with diethyl pyrocarbonate strongly inhibited the atp-dependent phosphorylation activity, although the sulfhydryl reagents n-ethylmaleimide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, and iodoacetate were without effect. these results serve to characterize the hpr (serine) kinase, which apparently regulates the rates of  carbohydrate transport in streptococcal cells via the phosphotransferase system.  a primary role of this kinase in the control of cellular inducer levels and carbohydrate metabolic rates is proposed.

TI  == wide-spectrum antibiotic activity of bovine granulocyte polypeptides.
AB  == the antibiotic activity of a polypeptide fraction purified from bovine granulocyte granules was tested against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, bacillus subtilis, bacillus stearothermophilus, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, and clinical isolates of staphylococcus and enterobacter  spp. all of these bacterial species were susceptible to the antibiotic polypeptide(s), with mics ranging from 3 to 100 micrograms of protein per ml. the antimicrobial activity was resistant to boiling and abolished by proteinase treatment. saccharomyces cerevisiae and human fibroblasts grew normally in the presence of 100 and 50 micrograms of antibiotic polypeptide(s) per ml, respectively. [3h]thymidine incorporation into bacterial, but not fibroblast, dna was efficiently and promptly inhibited by the antimicrobial polypeptide preparation. this suggests that its main target is a component of the system, which catalyzes and regulates the biosynthesis of bacterial dna.

TI  == the role of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in the persistence of streptococcal tonsillar infection.
AB  == the failure of penicillin to eradicate group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (gabhs) is a growing problem. this review summarizes current data concerning the  role of aerobic and anaerobic beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in the persistence of tonsillar infection caused by gabhs. clinical studies have demonstrated the recovery of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria and detectable levels of the enzyme beta-lactamase in cultures of core tonsillar specimens in greater than 80% of the patients. the predominant bacteria have been bacteroides  melaninogenicus, bacteroides oralis, bacteroides ruminicola, and staphylococcus aureus. these organisms have emerged in about one-third of patients after one course of penicillin therapy and can be transferred to patient's household contacts. these organisms were present in tonsillar cultures in higher numbers in children with acute tonsillitis who did not respond to penicillin therapy than in those who were cured. protection of gabhs by beta-lactamase-producing organisms has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. several studies, including a recent double-blinded study, have demonstrated the ability of clindamycin to eradicate the streptococcal carrier state and to prevent recurrent infection in selected patients.

TI  == evaluation of rapid identification of gram-positive cocci in positive blood cultures by use of the automicrobic system gram-positive identification card.
AB  == because rapid identification of gram-positive organisms from blood cultures may provide valuable information for patient care and because the automicrobic system gram-positive identification (ams-gpi) card (vitek systems, inc., hazelwood, mo.) is designed for the identification of these organisms in 4 to 13 h, we designed this study to evaluate the performance of the ams-gpi card in the direct identification of gram-positive organisms upon detection of growth in blood culture bottles. we compared direct identification by the ams-gpi card with the final ams-gpi card identification and with our standard identification methods. we evaluated 51 gram-positive organisms from clinical blood cultures as well as 49 simulated blood cultures. the isolates included streptococcus pneumoniae (17), streptococcus pyogenes (13), group d enterococci (12), streptococcus agalactiae (11), viridans streptococci (10), coagulase-negative staphylococci (21), staphylococcus aureus (15), and listeria monocytogenes (1). the ams-gpi card identified all of the group d enterococci, viridans streptococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci and all but one each of the streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae isolates. l. monocytogenes was also correctly identified. however, the ams-gpi card identified only 12 of 17 streptococcus pneumoniae and 9 of 15 staphylococcus aureus isolates by direct inoculation. we therefore conclude that the results of direct identification of gram-positive organisms by the ams-gpi card may be used cautiously for rapid direct identification of gram-positive organisms from positive blood cultures.

TI  == group a streptococcal peptidoglycan-polysaccharide inhibits phagocytic activity of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  == injection of sterile aqueous preparations of the peptidoglycan-polysaccharide of  group a streptococci (pg-aps) produces chronic inflammation in several animal models. chronic bacterial infection may be involved in some aspects of the pathogenesis of inflammation associated with the accumulation of pg-aps. accordingly, the effect of pg-aps on human neutrophil (polymorphonuclear leukocyte [pmn]) bactericidal activity was studied with the supposition that this interaction may contribute to the inflammation observed. concentrations of pg-aps greater than 10 micrograms/ml inhibited the ability of pmns to kill staphylococcus aureus. this inhibition was not due to a cytotoxic effect of pg-aps on pmns, nor did pg-aps inhibit pmn metabolism required for the formation  of microbicidal oxygen reduction products. pg-aps concentrations of 10 micrograms/ml or greater in the presence of 10% normal serum inhibited the attachment of bacteria to pmns by 49% as compared with control cell populations.  the concentrations of pg-aps required to inhibit uptake of staphylococcus aureus  were identical to those required for inhibition of pmn bactericidal activity. this inhibition did not occur in the presence of serum-free medium or medium with sera that had been heated to inactivate complement. these results show that pg-aps interacts with serum to inhibit pmn-mediated killing of s. aureus, most probably by interfering with bacterial uptake.

AB  == the synergistic hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes in the camp reaction by the sequential action of staphylococcal beta-lysin and the camp factor of group b streptococci is the only known function of this extracellular product of group b  streptococci. the reaction forms the basis of the camp test used to identify group b streptococci because the camp factor is believed to be restricted to this group of organisms. however, on occasion other streptococci, notably group a streptococci, may produce a similar synergistic lysis of sheep erythrocytes. the  nature of the synergistic lytic factor of group a streptococci responsible for this sequential hemolysis was investigated in a tube camp reaction system. the properties of this synergistic lytic factor were found to correspond to those of  streptolysin o of group a streptococci. the synergistic lytic factor, like streptolysin o, was produced during the logarithmic phase of growth; the activity was increased by reducing agents and greatly decreased or abolished by heat, trypsin, cholesterol, and anti-streptolysin o, and it was immunogenic in rabbits. this would suggest that the synergistic hemolysis seen in the camp reaction system with group a streptococci is due to the action of those small amounts of streptolysin o which remain unoxidized and thus have a capacity to lyse the fragile beta-lysin-treated sheep erythrocytes.

AB  == the preparation of a series of analogues of clindamycin is described in which the naturally occurring five-membered cyclic amino acid amide portion of the molecule is replaced by a four-, six-, or seven-membered cyclic amino acid amide. the most interesting compound is pirlimycin (7e, u-57,930e), in which the (2s-trans)-4-n-propylhygramide portion of clindamycin is replaced by (2s-cis)-4-ethylpipecolamide. this structural modification results in significantly favorable changes in toxicity, metabolism, and antibacterial potency. although the in vitro antibacterial activity of clindamycin and pirlimycin are nearly identical, the latter compound is 2-20 times more active than clindamycin when administered to mice experimentally infected with strains of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and plasmodium berghei. pirlimycin is absorbed in rats and  mice following both subcutaneous and oral administration. it readily penetrates b. fragilis induced abscesses in mice and is sequestered within these abscesses.  a drug concentration of at least 60 times the required inhibitory concentration is maintained for 6 h following a single subcutaneous dose of 200 mg/kg. urinary  excretion of total bioactivity consists only of intact pirlimycin with no other antibacterially active metabolites being detected. pirlimycin is tolerated well in rats and mice at the administered levels.

TI  == fibronectin binding to a streptococcus pyogenes strain.
AB  == in previous studies, staphylococcus aureus has been shown to bind fibronectin (p. kuusela, nature (london) 276:718-720, 1978), an interaction that may be important in bacterial attachment and opsonization. recently some strains of streptococci of serological groups a, c, and g were also found to bind fibronectin. the binding to one selected strain of streptococcus pyogenes has been characterized here. the binding of [125i]fibronectin to streptococcal cells resembles that to staphylococcal cells and was found to be time dependent, functionally irreversible, and specific in the sense that unlabeled proteins other than fibronectin did not block binding. bacteria incubated with proteases largely lost their ability to bind fibronectin, and material released from the streptococci by a brief trypsin digestion contained active fibronectin receptors. this material inhibited the binding of [125i]fibronectin to the streptococci. the inhibitory activity was adsorbed on a column of fibronectin-sepharose but not on a column of unsubstituted sepharose 4b or egg albumin sepharose. the receptor appeared to be  a protein nature since the inhibitory activity of the trypsinate was destroyed by papain and was not absorbed on a column containing monoclonal antibodies directed against lipoteichoic acid bound to protein a-sepharose. binding sites in fibronectin for streptococci and staphylococci, respectively, were localized by analyzing the ability of isolated fragments to inhibit [125i]fibronectin binding  to bacteria and by adsorbing 125i-labeled tryptic fragments with staphylococcal and streptococcal cells. both species of bacteria appeared to preferentially bind a fragment (mr = approximately 25,000) originating from the n-terminal region of  the protein. in addition, streptococci also bound a slightly smaller fragment (mr = approximately 23,000). fibronectin receptors solubilized from either streptococci or staphylococci inhibited the binding of fibronectin to both species of bacteria.

TI  == cefuroxime in acute septic arthritis.
AB  == cefuroxime was used in 17 patients with clinical, bacteriological and/or laboratory signs of acute septic arthritis in comparison with 10 patients given cloxacillin and ampicillin alone, or in combination. 14 patients in the study group had positive cultures (staphylococcus aureus, 10, s. epidermidis, 1, streptococcus pyogenes group g, 2 and acinetobacter, 1). three more patients with non-bacterial arthritis were included in an antibiotic penetration study. in 6 patients serum and joint fluid concentrations of cefuroxime were repeatedly determined by an assay using high pressure liquid chromatography. after 1.5 g intravenous cefuroxime the joint fluid concentrations were 16-80 and 5-40 mg/l at 2 and 8 h, respectively, exceeding the serum concentrations during that period of time. from the clinical and pharmacokinetic data a dosage of 1.5 g cefuroxime intravenously t.i.d. is recommended to the adult patient. this high dosage resulted in primary healing in 11 patients with one relapse one year later in a patient with a knee arthroplasty. half the dosage intramuscularly in 6 patients failed in 2. no side effects were seen during cefuroxime therapy.

TI  == bacterial sinusitis.
AB  == sinusitis may occur secondary to infectious agents, allergens, or pollutants. bacteriologic studies carried out from sinus punctures revealed that streptococcus pneumoniae and hemophilus influenzae are the most common bacterial  pathogens isolated. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes are not uncommon pathogens. complications of sinusitis, including orbital cellulitis, usually are due to infection with staphylococcus aureus and h influenzae. the recent increase in certain areas of the country of beta-lactamase-producing strains of h influenzae is noted. when the etiology remains to be determined in the patient with acute bacterial sinusitis, initial therapy with an oral cephalosporin seems warranted.

TI  == five cephalosporins: pharmacokinetics and their relation to antibacterial potency.
AB  == in a group of adult volunteers, pharmacokinetic profiles of five cephalosporins were correlated with their minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics90) against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter aerogenes. subjects received the following intravenous regimens in a randomized,  crossover fashion: (1) 0.5 gm, 1 gm, or 2 gm of cefazolin; (2) 2 gm of cephalothin; (3) 1 gm of cephapirin; (4) 1 gm of cefoxitin; or (5) 0.5 gm of cefamandole. the 500-mg dose of cefazolin produced serum concentrations that exceeded those of any of the other cephalosporins at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after administration. the area under the curve for this dose of cefazolin was at  least twice that of any of the other antibiotics. two hours after a 500-mg dose of cefazolin, serum levels exceeded the mic90 for all seven groups of pathogens;  at six hours, the 500-mg dose of cefazolin continued to achieve serum levels above the mic90 against the majority of bacterial groups. in contrast, at two hours after administration none of the other cephalosporins maintained serum levels above the mic90 for all pathogens; at six hours, the levels of cephapirin  were adequate to inhibit the two streptococci, but serum levels of all other cephalosporins were inadequate to inhibit any of the pathogens. these data indicate that a 500-mg dose of cefazolin maintains serum levels above the mics90  longer than any of the other cephalosporins tested and support the use of a 500-mg dose of cefazolin every eight hours for surgical prophylaxis and treatment of most community-acquired infections. such a comparatively low dosage offers substantial savings to both patient and hospital.

TI  == ability of various oral bacteria to bind human plasma fibronectin.

TI  == characteristics of non-clinical mammary infections of goats.
AB  == this study, carried out on 1217 milk goats (2428 milk samples), sampled at two different periods of lactation, showed that non-clinical mammary infections of the goat were due to major pathogens (7.5%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci  (24.1%). among major pathogens, staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated species (75.2%). however, great variations were observed between herds,  in levels of infection by major pathogens. the intensity of the inflammatory response, measured by the cell count, depended on the pathogen present in the mammary gland. evidence was found that 75% of infections persisted throughout the lactation and 61% during the dry-period. the arithmetic mean cell counts for milk samples from halves infected with major pathogens was 6.77 x 10(6) cells/ml, determined by coulter counter. it was 1.78 and 1.54 x 10(6) cells/ml respectively for halves infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci and non-infected halves. the arithmetic mean cell counts were higher at drying-off than in lactation. the threshold of 1 x 10(6) cells/ml was reliable for diagnosis in mid-lactation and permitted to diagnose 72% of major pathogen infections.

TI  == ceftriaxone: a summary of in vitro antibacterial qualities including recommendations for susceptibility tests with 30-micrograms disks.
AB  == the new aminothiazoyl-cephalosporin, ceftriaxone (ro 13-9904), was found to have  excellent inhibitory activity against the enterobacteriaceae (minimum inhibitory  concentration needed to inhibit 50% of isolates (mic50) less than or equal to 0.004-0.5 microgram/ml, haemophilus influenzae (mic50 less than or equal to 0.004 micrograms/ml), neisseria species (mic50 less than or equal to 0.001 microgram/ml), pneumococci (mic50 0.25 micrograms/ml), staphylococcus aureus (mic50 2.0 micrograms/ml), and streptococcus pyogenes (mic50 0.015 micrograms/ml). ceftriaxone was less effective against acinetobacter species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other pseudomonas species (mic50 8.0-16 micrograms/ml). methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococci were not significantly inhibited by ceftriaxone. ceftriaxone was very resistant to beta-lactamase hydrolysis, although the type iv cephalosporinase minimally destroyed the compound at 16.4-19.9% of the rates for cephaloridine. type i cephalosporinases were inhibited by ceftriaxone and related enzyme-stable cephalosporins. based on analysis of disk-mic regression statistics, tentative recommendations for the disk test of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards are 21 mm or more = susceptible, 14-20 mm = moderately susceptible, and 13 mm or less = resistant. these criteria produce interpretive accuracy of more than 92%, with very rare major errors. ceftriaxone was comparable to cefotaxime in spectrum and activity, thus allowing the use of the "spectrum-class" concept (for example, cefotaxime tests in vitro to predict ceftriaxone susceptibility, and vice versa).

AB  == samples were taken from blood accumulated in dental alveoli after surgical removal of mandibular third molars, from subgingival plaque of teeth with advanced periodontal destructions, from teeth with infected necrotic pulps, and from subjects suffering from angular cheilitis. of the microorganisms subcultured from these samples, 116 strains were assayed for enzymes degrading fibrinogen and fibrin. enzymes degrading fibrinogen were assayed with the thin-layer enzyme assay cultivation technique. this assay involves the cultivation of microorganisms on culture agars applied over fibrinogen-coated polystyrene surfaces. enzymes degrading fibrin were assayed with both a plate assay and a tube assay, in which fibrin was mixed with a microbial culture medium. microorganisms degrading fibrinogen or fibrin or both were isolated from all sampling sites. activity was mainly detected in strains of actinomyces, bacteroides, fusobacterium, peptococcus, propionibacterium, and staphylococcus aureus. most fusobacterium strains degraded fibrinogen only. enzymes degrading fibrinogen as well as enzymes degrading fibrin via activation of plasminogen were revealed in strains of clostridium, s. aureus, and streptococcus pyogenes. it was generally found that fibrinogen was degraded by more strains than was fibrin, which indicates that different proteases may be involved.

TI  == teichomycin: in-vitro and in-vivo evaluation in comparison with other antibiotics.
AB  == teichomycin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic with a spectrum of activity similar to that of vancomycin, was highly active against staphylococci, streptococci and gram-positive anaerobes (propionibacterium acnes, clostridium perfringens and cl. difficile). ninety per cent of the staphylococcus aureus and streptococcal strains, including enterococci, were inhibited by 0.4 mg/l; 90% of staph. epidermidis strains were susceptible to 1.6 mg/l. vancomycin was less active than teichomycin against all clinical isolates tested. multiply resistant strains, including methicillin-resistant staph. aureus, were all susceptible to teichomycin and vancomycin. teichomycin was highly bactericidal for growing cells of staphylococci and streptococcus pyogenes and moderately bactericidal for str.  faecalis. in mice, teichomycin was well absorbed upon subcutaneous administration and had a half-life of 2.5 h. it was very effective in curing experimental mouse  septicemias caused by gram-positive bacteria (ed50 values less than 1 mg/kg).

AB  == t-1982 (cefbuperazone), a new cephamycin antibiotic, was basically and clinically studied in the field of pediatrics, and the following results were obtained. 1. the antibacterial activity of t-1982 was compared with that of cez, cmz and abpc. t-1982 was more active than the other drugs against gram-negative bacteria, the sensitivity of e. coli (22 strains), k. pneumoniae (18 strains), p. mirabilis (19 strains), p. vulgaris (4 strains), p. morganii (5 strains) and k. oxytoca (4 strains) distributing less than 0.39, 0.1, 1.56, 0.39, 6.25 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively. two of 3 strains of c. freundii were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml. against gram-positive bacteria, the activity of t-1982 was inferior to that of the other drugs. s. pyogenes (28 strains) were inhibited by 0.78 microgram/ml or less, but the sensitivity of s. aureus (34 strains distributed 12.5-100 micrograms/ml). 2. t-1982 was administered to each 3 children at a dose of 20 mg/kg by one shot intravenous injection or 1 hour drip infusion, or at dose of 40 mg/kg by 1 hour drip infusion. the mean serum levels at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after one shot intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg were respectively 74.3, 56.3, 42.3, 17.6, 5.7 and 1.2 micrograms/ml with the mean half-life of 1.01 hours. the values were 32.9, 50.0, 73.7, 27.5, 12.4 and 4.5 micrograms/ml and 1.31 hours by intravenous drip infusion of 20 mg/kg and 50.4, 104.7, 136.3, 62.3, 18.6 and 6.9 micrograms/ml and 1.16 hours by intravenous drip infusion of 40 mg/kg. the mean urinary recovery rates within 6 hours were 47.7, 67.6 and 60.9%, respectively. 3. treatment with t-1982 was made  in 28 cases of pediatric infections; 1 case of acute bronchitis, 19 cases of acute bronchopneumonia or lobar pneumonia, 2 cases of acute purulent cervical lymphadenitis, 4 cases of acute pyelonephritis and each 1 case of subcutaneous abscess and suspected bacterial endocarditis. the clinical responses assessed in  27 cases were excellent in 21 cases, good in 5 cases and poor in 1 case, the efficacy rate being 96.3%. bacteriologically, 2 strains of s. aureus, 3 strains of s. pneumoniae, 4 strains of h. influenzae, 2 strains of e. coli and 1 strain of p. mirabilis were eradicated. one strain of s. faecalis was reduced. no side effects were observed in any cases. slight elevation of got and gpt and that of got were noted in each 1 case.

TI  == binding of human fibronectin to group a, c, and g streptococci.
AB  == a total of 387 bacterial strains belonging to 35 species were tested in direct binding experiments for the uptake of purified radiolabeled human fibronectin. positive binding was found in group a, c, and g streptococci and in staphylococcus aureus. the group c streptococcal species streptococcus equisimilis, streptococcus zooepidemicus, streptococcus equi, and streptococcus dysgalactiae were uniformly reactive with fibronectin. beta-hemolytic bovine group g streptococci showed the same degree of reactivity as human group g strains. in contrast, only 4 out of 15 alpha-hemolytic bovine group g strains were able to bind fibronectin. the uptake of fibronectin measured at room temperature with a human group g streptococcus was a slow, time-dependent process with maximum binding after approximately 1 h. human polyclonal immunoglobulin g and serum albumin tested in inhibition experiments did not affect the fibronectin binding. fibronectin seems, therefore, to interact with a surface component that  is different from the specific binding sites previously described for human immunoglobulin g and serum albumin.

AB  == the specificity and sensitivity of agglutination, complement fixation, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) procedures in the detection of antibodies to haemophilus somnus was investigated. h. somnus rabbit immune sera were found to agglutinate pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus aureus, and haemophilus agni and, in some instances, also pasteurella haemolytica, salmonella dublin, streptococcus agalactiae, and corynebacterium pyogenes. in complement fixation tests with saline extracts as antigens, only h. agni reacted with h. somnus antisera to any significant degree. in elisa tests with sonicated or heat-extracted antigens, cross-reactions were seen with the two pasteurella spp.  and with h. agni. when whole cells and saline extracts were used as antigens in elisas, only h. agni showed any cross-reactivity. the greatest specificity in distinguishing homologous from heterologous reactions was achieved by elisa with  saline extracts as antigens. escherichia coli and brucella abortus antigens failed to react with h. somnus antibody in any of the tests. a rabbit serum containing antibody to bovine type isolates of p. multocida, p. haemolytica, s. aureus, s. agalactiae, s. dublin, c. pyogenes, and e. coli gave no positive reaction in elisa tests with saline extract of h. somnus as antigen. it is concluded that such saline extract, which appears to consist largely of h. somnus common antigen, has the potential of being a useful diagnostic reagent in the study by elisa of antibody response to h. somnus.

AB  == the prevalence of strictly anaerobic bacteria in the secretions from untreated cases of mastitis in lactating dairy cows was investigated. the study involved 147 friesland cows in 12 highveld herds. all herds yielded cows with anaerobic udder infections. no anaerobic bacteria were recovered from cows with normal quarters or those with latent aerobic infections. only anaerobes were present in  10% of so-called 'aseptic' mastitis cases. a variety of anaerobic organisms was isolated concurrently with facultative bacteria from 5,3% and 58,8% of cases classified as subclinical and clinical respectively. peptococcus spp. was associated with corynebacterium pyogenes and bacteroides spp. with staphylococcus aureus and/or streptococcus agalactiae in 80% anaerobic udder infections. gram positive anaerobic species were mostly sensitive to penicillin-g but all the gram negative rods were resistant. in addition, all b. fragilis strains produced beta-lactamase. the ability to produce heparinase was demonstrated in one strain  of peptococcus indolicus and a peptostreptococcus sp.

TI  == comparison of a miniaturized culture test and sheep blood agar for the recovery of group a streptococci from throat cultures.
AB  == a miniaturized culture test (strep test) was compared with conventional sheep blood agar (sba) for the detection of group a streptococci (gas) from throat swabs. a total of 355 throat cultures were obtained in duplicate from symptomatic children and assessed by the two methods after overnight incubation. gas were detected in 109 specimens by the strep test, in 100 specimens by sba and in 118 specimens by both methods. there was no significant difference between the recovery rate of gas by the strep test (92.4%) and sba (84.7%) (0.1 greater than  p greater than 0.05). the strep test was 85.2% specific for detection of gas. the rates of false positive and false negative reactions with the strep test were 24.3 and 4.3%, respectively. beta-hemolytic streptococci other than group a, staphylococcus aureus and alpha-hemolytic streptococci produced false positive reactions. the viability of gas on the strep test was also tested. gas were recovered from 27 of 28 (96.4%) strep tests at 24 hours and 25 of 27 (92.6%) tests at 72 hours after inoculation. these results indicate that strep test is as sensitive as the conventional sba method in recovering gas. the strep test is simple to use, is easy to interpret and has a long shelf life. because of the high rate of false positive results (24.3%), this test may not be the best alternative method to sba for use in office practice.

AB  == receptors for igg fc in many group a, c and g streptococci have been reported previously. we now describe a reaction between group a, c and g streptococci and  igg fab-parts, not involving the antigen combining sites. the bacteria proved to  bind aggregated, but not monomeric, igg fab-fragments, indicating that multivalent interaction was a prerequisite for the binding to occur. most of the  strains exhibiting affinity for aggregated igg fab could also interact with aggregated k and/or lambda light chains. the capacity of the single strains to bind aggregated igg fab did not correlate with presence of igg fc-receptor activity. furthermore, in contrast to streptococcal fc-receptors, the streptococcal structure reacting with fab was highly sensitive to trypsin as well as phosphatase treatment. the binding of aggregated lambda-chains to each of two  strains tested was inhibited by liquoid and aggregated human albumin, suggesting  that lipoteichoic acid and/or m protein are responsible for the binding of igg fab-fragments. a pronounced binding of aggregated igg fab, but not light chains,  to staphylococcus aureus, strain cowan i, was also found. various other bacterial species were tested for binding of the aggregates, with negative results.

AB  == heat-killed group a streptococcus pyogenes induced platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma. aggregation was dependent upon the ratio of platelets to bacteria, with maximal aggregation occurring at 0.8 platelets per bacterium (final concentration, 300,000 per microliter). inhibition of the reaction by 3 mm edta indicated it was a true aggregation and not merely adhesion and agglutination. lactic acid dehydrogenase assays indicated lysis of platelets did  not occur during a 6-min incubation period. aggregation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by acetylsalicylic acid (100 microm to 10 mm) and quinacrine (15.6 to 250 microm), with no decrease in aggregation at the lowest concentration of inhibitor tested. s. pyogenes induced the release of [14c]serotonin, which was maximal (50%) at 2.4 min, when aggregation was nearly complete. gel-filtered platelets were not aggregated unless fibrinogen (final concentration, 1.8 mg/ml) was included in the reaction mixture. staphylococcus aureus, a group b streptococcus, and escherichia coli were unable to induce aggregation in platelet-rich plasma under the conditions used for s. pyogenes.

AB  == peptidoglycans and cells walls from actinomyces viscosus, staphylococcus aureus,  and group a streptococcus were compared for their relative abilities to activate  the alternate complement pathway (acp). on the dry-weight basis, the peptidoglycan from a. viscosus was 3.5 times more active than group a streptococcal peptidoglycan and 15.6 times more active than staph. aureus peptidoglycan in activating the acp. consequently a. viscosus peptidoglycan is one of the most potent acp-activators reported to date. for both a. viscosus and  group a streptococcus, the peptidoglycan was a better acp activator than cell walls from the same organism (125- and 52-fold, respectively) indicating that the peptidoglycan is probably the most important subcellular acp-activator in these microorganisms. in contrast, cell walls from staph, aureus were 9 times more active than peptidoglycan from staph. aureus in activating the acp, presumably because teichoic acids are the most important subcellular acp activator in this microorganism.

(2), and streptococcus pyogenes (1). nonpathogenic bacteria isolated in 14 cases included streptococcus epidermidis, diphtheroids and streptococcus viridans. two aspirates were sterile. a satisfactory clinical response was achieved in 15 of 21 cases (71%) treated with amoxicillin and 14 of  19 cases (74%) treated with cefaclor. we conclude that amoxicillin and cefaclor are comparable in efficacy for the therapy of acute otitis media with effusion in early infancy.

TI  == survival of cultured cells after functional and structural disorganization of plasma membrane by bacterial haemolysins and phospholipases.
AB  == lesions were induced in the plasma membranes of cultured human fibroblasts by membrane damaging toxins of bacterial origin (haemolysins). structural disorganization of the membrane was measured as leakage of a radiolabelled small  cytoplasmic marker and functional membrane damage was measured as decreased uptake of aminoisobutyrate. cell survival was scored 24 and 48 hr later by measuring uptake of trypan blue and by light microscopical evaluation of cell morphology and proliferation. the membrane damage induced by most bacterial toxins was reversible upon removal of the toxin, since toxin-treated cells recovered and excluded trypan blue although they had been permeable to the dye immediately after the toxin treatment. among ten bacterial toxins tested, the only exception of this general behavior was the aeromonas hydrophila beta-haemolysin, which irreversibly damaged human fibroblasts. thus, the action of bacterial haemolysins on cultured cells generally seems restricted to a plasma membrane permeabilization, which is reversible regardless of the mechanism of membrane damaging action of the toxin or of the relative size of the structural lesions induced. furthermore, the use of trypan blue uptake as a measure of cell  death caused by membrane damaging agents appears to be of limited value.

TI  == detection and partial characterization of antibacterial factor(s) in alveolar lining material of rats.
AB  == intracellular killing of staphylococcus aureus by alveolar macrophages is known to be enhanced by exposure to alveolar lining material. because this material may have a role in pulmonary host defenses, we have studied its effect on pneumococci and other nonstaphylococcal organisms. alveolar lining material from rats caused  rapid killing and lysis of pneumococci. the antipneumococcal activity was localized to the surfactant-containing fraction of the fluid and was not affected by trypsin. phospholipid extracts of the surfactant fraction or purified lamellar bodies killed pneumococci. lysis of pneumococci by the surfactant fraction appeared to be mediated by a detergent-like activation of pneumococcal autolysin, in that bacteriolysis was prevented by substitution of ethanolamine for choline in pneumococcal cell walls, and a pneumococcal transformant that lacked autolysin was not lysed. the surfactant fraction readily killed pneumococci containing ethanolamine or the autolysin-defective transformant, and studies with tritiated  methyl-d-glucose loading and release showed that killing was associated with increased bacterial cell membrane permeability. bactericidal activity (without lysis) was observed with several nonpneumococcal gram-positive bacteria, including streptococcus viridans, unspeciated respiratory streptococci, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus bovis, and bacillus species. purified diacylphospholipids had no antibacterial activity, however, a lysophospholipid, palmitoyl lysophosphatidylcholine, had many properties resembling the surfactant-containing fraction of lavage, including autolysin-mediated pneumococcal lysis, altered cell membrane permeability, and antibacterial activity against several gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == [isolation and evaluation of properties of muramidase causing the lysis of group  a streptococci].
AB  == muramidase which actively lyses the cell walls of group a hemolytic streptococci  has been isolated from the culture fluid of actinomyces levoris by precipitation  on ammonium sulfate, gel filtration on sephadex g-25, ion exchange chromatography on deae cellulose and double electrofocusing. the enzyme thus obtained has shown  its maximum activity at 40-50 degrees c. at 60 degrees c muramidase was completely inactivated. the enzyme has a wide range of optimum ph values: 5.0-9.5. the highest percentage of lysis of streptococcal cell walls has been observed in plycine-naoh and potassium phosphate buffers at ph 8.0. muramidase completely lysed streptococcus pyogenes cells of different serological groups except enterococci (group d) and staphylococci. this sign allows to differentiate group d streptococcus from streptococci of other groups.

TI  == conjugative transfer of r-plasmids from streptococcus faecalis to staphylococcus  aureus.
AB  == r-plasmids originally isolated from streptococcus pyogenes(pac1,pam15346), streptococcus agalactiae(pip501), and streptococcus faecalis(pam beta 1) were shown to be self-transferable on filter membranes from s. faecalis jh2-2 to staphylococcus aureus recipients. the nonconjugative plasmid pam alpha 1 was mobilized into s. aureus by pam beta 1. once in s. aureus, conjugative r-plasmids could be transferred to a second s. aureus recipient or back into s. faecalis. determinants for chloramphenicol, clindamycin, erythromycin, and tetracycline resistances present on these streptococcal plasmids were expressed in s. aureus.  agarose gel electrophoresis, dye-buoyant centrifugation, and restriction endonuclease digestion showed that the plasmids were maintained intact as self-replicating elements in s. aureus recipients.

TI  == gram-positive bacteria-induced granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis in rabbits.
AB  == pneumococci have been shown to induce granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis  which might contribute to morbidity and mortality in pneumococcal sepsis. we studied whether other gram-positive species (groups a and b streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and clostridium perfringens) could also induce these phenomena. rabbits were challenged with nonviable preparations of each species, and all five species induced profound granulocytopenia (mean decrease of 90%) and pulmonary leukostasis. in vitro studies of serum incubated with these species of bacteria showed a mean consumption of total hemolytic complement of 90%, a mean increase of chemotactic activity for granulocytes of 204%, and a mean augmentation of granulocyte adherence of 45% (compared with 18%  for the control). infusion of sonicate-exposed sera induced granulocytopenia in recipient rabbits. thus, several nonviable gram-positive species can interact with serum to activate the complement system, generate c5a bioactivity, augment granulocyte adherence, and generate a neutropenia-inducing factor. these alterations may contribute to granulocytopenia or pulmonary leukostasis, which may play a role in the morbidity and mortality associated with gram-positive bacterial infections.

TI  == in vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  == norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. we examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including  anaerobic species. it inhibited 90% (mic90) of strains of escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, salmonella and shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. the mics of proteus mirabilis, morganella sp., proteus vulgaris, proteus rettgeri, and providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 of serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. for pseudomonas aeruginosa the mic50, the mic75, and the mic90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic50 of pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the mic90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. yersinia, arizona, and aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was campylobacter. the activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the mic90s of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. all listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. the activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, ph, or inoculum size. there was no major difference between mic and minimum bactericidal concentration values. norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.

TI  == studies on bacterial hypersensitivity in man. interrelationship between skin reactions to bacterial peptidoglycan and serum peptidoglycan antibody titers.
AB  == the nature and extent of bacterially induced allergies are difficult to define. since peptidoglycan, the main component of the cell wall of almost all bacteria,  has been available in a highly purified, chemically and immunologically well-defined form, investigation of the allergological significance of this cell  component is feasible. intracutaneous tests were carried out on 181 test subjects with five different peptidoglycan (pg) preparations from staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pyogenes. the results of the investigation were compared with the result of determination of serum pg antibodies and serum ige concentrations. it was shown that test subjects with dual and later reactions to three different staphylococcal pgs displayed significantly higher pg antibody titers than test subjects with negative reactions. such a relationship could not be found with the cutaneous reactions to streptococcal pg. the total serum ige values were very much higher in test subjects with immediate reactions to staphylococcal pg than in test subjects with a negative reaction. typical arthus reaction or late granulomatous reactions were not observed. humoral antibodies are involved at least in part in the elicitation of dual and late reactions. thus, there are interesting parallels to allergy to fungal spores and organic dusts.

TI  == cationic polyelectrolytes, liquoid and leukocyte extract modulate the binding of  igg to group a streptococcal fc-receptors.
AB  == various polyelectrolytes were investigated regarding their capacity to inhibit the binding of human igg to fc-receptors on group a streptococci, type m1. of cationic substances, protamine and arginine-rich histone inhibited significantly, while lysine-rich histone, concanavalin a, lysozyme, polymyxin b, ribonuclease and tuftsin did not. of anionic materials, liquoid was inhibitory, in contrast to chondroitin sulphate, dextran sulphate, dna and heparin. washing experiments showed that the inhibition was caused by binding of the polyelectrolytes to the streptococci. the finding that heated igg inhibited the binding of histone to the streptococci also indicated a close relation between the binding sites for these  compounds. diffusion-in-gel experiments with alkaline extract of m1 demonstrated  that the substances blocking the igg fc-receptor were bound to polyglycerophosphate, suggesting that the inhibition of the igg uptake was due to interaction with lipoteichoic acid. leukocyte and platelet extracts could modify  the binding of igg, probably by an enzymatic digestion of the receptors. the arginine-rich histone was also capable of inhibiting the binding of igg to type m15 group a streptococci and to one group g strain. however, the polyelectrolytes had no effect on the binding of igg to staphylococcus aureus or of iga to type 4  group a streptococci.

AB  == thirty-nine streptococcal strains belonging to groups a, c, and g and 12 staphylococcal strains were investigated with respect to surface charge and hydrophobicity. isoelectric points of the bacteria were determined by cross-partition experiments in dextran-polyethylene glycol two-phase systems containing charged polymers. the results obtained indicate that group a, c, and g streptococci have isoelectric points of ph 3.75 +/- 0.15 standard deviation. staphylococci show an isoelectric point of around ph 2 and thereby differ markedly from the streptococci. pretreatment of bacteria with human serum resulted in a significant change in the isoelectric points of streptococci. in a  second series of experiments, an aqueous dextran-polyethylene glycol two-phase system containing polyethylene glycol palmitate or stearate was used to study the hydrophobic surface properties of the bacterial cells. the partition of the staphylococci was not influenced by the addition of up to 1% (wt/wt) polyethylene glycol palmitate or stearate, whereas the streptococci showed a large variation in affinity for polyethylene glycol-bound hydrophobic groups. the bacterial strains included in the study were also tested for uptake of human serum proteins. a positive correlation was found between the hydrophobic affinity of group a streptococci and the density of receptors for aggregated beta-2-microglobulin.

AB  == outbreaks of wound infection with streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus occurred in a abattoir and a pork-processing factory in autumn 1980. investigations showed that staff handling the meat before de-boning were particularly affected and that bone was the cause of 48% of the wounds which became clinicially infected. of the total isolates of strep. pyogenes and staph.  aureus from wounds of known cause 75% were from lesions caused by bone. in one outbreak streptococcal infection was seen principally in newly-employed staff. group l streptococci were found in several sites in the pork factory and were isolated from infected lesions in two workers. strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus  were cultured from tap handles in the lavatories. sixty-six workers were examined in a non-epidemic period and 59% were found to have current wounds on the hand or wrists; 13% of wounds were infected but strep. pyogenes was not isolated. bone was the commonest of the many causes of injury, accounting for 31% of all wounds. butchers had the highest rates of wounding and most bone-inflicted injury was seen in this group. packers were the only group to wear protective gloves regularly. damaged fingernails were found in 50% of workers, including a high proportion of nail-biters (33% of all workers). the epidemic strain of staph. aureus was cultured from bitten fingernails. three of four infected workers carrying epidemic organisms in the throat were examined and all were nail-biters. sharp-edged bone was produced by rotary saws early in the production line and bone dust contaminated the carcasses and adjacent surfaces. it is suggested that  bone fragments could contaminate wounds and that this might have implications for the initiation of infection and the development of outbreaks.

TI  == studies of the staphylococcal causation of toxic shock syndrome.
AB  == the data presented in this study indicate that the staphylococcus aureus is related casually to the toxic shock syndrome and that the dominant phage type was 29. this type has occurred singly as well as in combination with phage type 52 and some other group i phage types. the 29, 52 complex was present in approximately two-thirds of a series of 159 isolates of staphylococcus aureus obtained from patients with toxic shock syndrome, while another fourth was nontypable. in further support of this concept was the evidence that 94.1 per cent of the isolates of the 29, 52 phage complex tested were capable of producing pyrogenic exotoxin c. these results gave confirmatory evidence of the etiologic importance of this phage type complex of staphylococcus aureus. the high percentage of 25.8 per cent nontypable isolated has remained unexplained, and this is suggestive of the possibility that another important phage type may be present but obscure, since 83 per cent were shown to be capable of producing pyrogenic c toxin. the data reported also indicated that the current activity of  this phage type is another manifestation of the versatility of staphylococcus aureus and its ability to produce different pathogenic strains capable of causing different or new infections in clinical practice.

AB  == bacteriological study of 61 patients with diabetic gangrene or non-gangrenous foot ulcers was undertaken to determine the pattern of infection and antimicrobial susceptibility with a view to suggest optimal antibiotic therapy for these patients. gangrenous ulcers showed a higher frequency of mixed infection; the predominant organisms being enterococci, proteus sp., pseudomonas  sp. and klebsiella sp. infected non-gangrenous ulcers showed staph. pyogenes, and beta haemolytic streptococcus as single organism in 12 patients. anaerobes were more frequently isolated in gangrenous lesions than in non-gangrenous ulcers. antimicrobial susceptibility showed that gram positive organisms were sensitive to co-trimoxazole, cephaloridine, ampicillin and penicillin. gram negative aerobic bacilli were sensitive to gentamycin, chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazole and  streptomycin. anaerobes were sensitive to chloramphenicol, clindamycin and metronidazole. antibiotics of choice for gangrenous lesions with spreading infection and septicaemia are a combination of gentamycin, ampicillin and metronidazole as an adjuvant to surgical treatment.

TI  == participation of immunoglobulins and complement components in the intracellular killing of staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli by human granulocytes.
AB  == immunoglobulins and complement components are required for optimal ingestion and  optimal killing of microorganisms by granulocytes. the degree of opsonization of  microorganisms necessary for their ingestion was lower than that required for the killing of these bacteria during the ingestion phase. killing during this phase was found to depend mainly on the presence of heat-labile opsonins, probably c3b, present on the microorganisms. extracellular immunoglobulin g (igg) and c3b were  indispensable for optimal intracellular killing after ingestion was complete. this was established with an assay permitting assessment of the course of the number of viable intracellular bacteria independent of the ingestion of new live  bacteria. maximal intracellular killing by human granulocytes of ingested catalase-positive (staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli) or catalase-negative (streptococcus pyogenes and s. pneumoniae) microorganisms was found only when fresh serum was present extracellularly. killing was suboptimal in the absence of serum. with heat-inactivated serum, the killing index lay between the indices obtained in the presence and absence of fresh serum. the stimulatory activity of heat-inactivated serum was most probably due to the interaction of igg with the fc receptor on the granulocyte membrane, since igg subclasses igg1 and igg3 as well as pfc fragments of igg stimulated the intracellular killing to the same degree as heat-inactivated serum did. in addition, (fab1)2 fragments of igg did not stimulate killing, and reduced killing was observed in the presence of heat-inactivated serum after reduction of the number of fc receptors. the extra stimulation of the killing process in the presence of fresh serum compared with heat-inactivated serum was due to the interaction between membrane receptors and complement--most probably c3b generated by both the classical and the alternative pathways of complement activation. this conclusion is based on results obtained with sera in which one or both complement pathways were blocked, on the restoration of the killing-stimulatory activity of c3-deficient serum after addition of fresh c3, and on the reduced killing observed in the presence of fresh serum after reduction of the number of c3 receptors by the use of pronase or antigranulocyte  serum.

TI  == peritonitis in cirrhotic patients with leveen shunts.
AB  == six cirrhotic patients are described in whom peritonitis developed from 10 days to 15 months after the insertion of a leveen shunt. the presenting clinical features of fever, increasing ascites and deterioration in mental status resembled these previously reported for cirrhotic patients but with spontaneous peritonitis without shunts. important differences were observed, however, in microbiology, incidence of bacteremia and therapy. staphylococcus aureus, a rare  cause of spontaneous peritonitis, was found in one half of our cases, suggesting  that perioperative contamination during shunt placement was an important etiologic factor. all six had concomitant bacteremia which may be attributable to the direct peritoneal-venous connection. appropriate systemic antimicrobial therapy without shunt removal failed to eradicate the infection irrespective of the patency of the shunt or absence of inflammation at the sites of insertion. recommended treatment for suspected peritonitis in patients with shunts is systemic antimicrobial therapy with an agent active against staphylococci plus an aminoglycoside, followed by removal of the shunt if the diagnosis is confirmed.

TI  == a genetic locus responsible for salmonella susceptibility in bsvs mice is not responsible for the limited t-dependent immune responsiveness of bsvs mice.
AB  == bsvs mice are known to be highly susceptible to salmonella infection. we have shown that the bulk of the difference in susceptibility between bsvs and salmonella-resistant a/j mice is the result of a genetic difference at a single locus not closely linked to h-2, igh-c, or hbb, and not x-linked. we have backcrossed the a/j allele at this locus into bsvs mice for 8 successive generations and have demonstrated that the salmonella resistance afforded by this allele is not the result of a restoration of the generalized poor t-dependent responsiveness of bsvs mice. the salmonella resistance locus we have examined with these 2 strains is probably the same as the ity locus described by others.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of first, second and third generation cephalosporins.
AB  == minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined against 662 recent clinical isolates for eight cephalosporins representing first, second and third generation compounds. all four third-generation cephalosporins tested (cefoperaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and moxalactam) were significantly more active against aerobic gram-negative bacteria than the older compounds (cephalothin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cefuroxime). cefotaxime and moxalactam  were most active against enterobacteriaceae with extremely low mic-values. ceftazidime was definitely most active against pseudomonas aeruginosa with more than 90% of strains inhibited at 4 micro g/ml. mic-values for cefotaxime against  staphylococcus aureus were for all strains 1-2 micro g/ml, slightly higher for cefoperazone, while the effect of ceftazidime and moxalactam was more limited. all third generation cephalosporins demonstrated efficiency against streptococcus pyogenes, cefotaxime being most active and moxalactam least active, but were essentially ineffective against streptococcus faecalis. moxalactam demonstrated higher activity against bacteroides fragilis than other second and third generation cephalosporins including cefoxitin. previous studies have demonstrated a very high activity of all third generation cephalosporins against haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae, including beta-lactamase producing strains.

TI  == bacteriologic studies on electronic hospital thermometers.
AB  == electronic thermometers used in many hospitals require insertion into the mouth of a temperature-sensing probe covered by a pre-packaged probe cover. handling procedures used by hospital personnel can lead to inadvertent manual contact with the probe cover. we attempted to determine the rate of non-sterility of these probe covers under normal hospital conditions and the extent to which pathogens could be detected on these and other components of the thermometer. probe covers  were removed before entry into the patient's mouth and aseptically inoculated into fluid thioglycollate medium. subcultures were made to appropriate differential media. over a 13-week period, 180 covers were cultured on two private hospital services. forty-three percent were found to be non-sterile; control covers from central supply were only 6% non-sterile. four percent of the  probe covers harbored potential pathogens: coagulase positive staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterobacter, and bacteroides. no attempt was made to correlate these findings with infection. these results indicated a potential infection hazard for high-risk patient groups and a need by hospital personnel to consider this as a possible source of contamination.

TI  == mannitol agar for microbiologic diagnosis of bovine mastitis.
AB  == a medium containing mannitol (mannitol agar) was developed and evaluated as a tool for the microbiologic diagnosis of bovine mastitis. mannitol agar supported  growth of all important bacterial mastitis pathogens (staphylococci, streptococci, coliforms, and pseudomonads) except corynebacterium pyogenes. color change around colonies in the agar permitted the differentiation of pathogenic from nonpathogenic staphylococci. most staphylococcus aureus strains and some staphylococcus epidermidis strains produced yellow zones. these yellow zone-producing strains (mannitol fermenters) of staphylococci were obtained from  quarters with significantly elevated (p less than 0.05) somatic cell counts (scc) in the milk, as compared with uninfected quarters and, therefore, would be considered pathogens. mannitol-negative strains of s epidermidis (those with red  zones) were obtained from quarters with scc similar to those of uninfected quarters. the streptococci could be divided into 2 groups on the basis of color change around the colonies: streptococcus agalactiae, str dysgalactiae, and group g streptococci produced red zones; str uberis, str bovis, and enterococci produced yellow zones. pathogenic streptococci (str agalactiae, str dysgalactiae, str uberis, and group g streptococci) were obtained from quarters with scc significantly higher (p less than 0.01) than those of uninfected quarters. streptococcus bovis and enterococci were obtained from quarters with scc similar  to those of uninfected quarters and were considered nonpathogenic. pathogenic streptococci were found in much higher concentration than nonpathogenic streptococci and could be differentiated on that basis.

TI  == effect of extracellular serum in the stimulation of intracellular killing of streptococci by human monocytes.
AB  == this study shows that the intracellular killing of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae by human monocytes is stimulated by the extracellular presence of both heat-stable and heat-labile serum factors. a similar kind of stimulation of monocytes has been described in respect of catalase-positive microorganisms. however, killing of these bacteria is negligible in the absence of extracellular serum factors, whereas a large proportion of the ingested catalase-negative bacteria are killed in the absence of such extracellular stimuli. monocytes from patients with chronic granulomatous disease, which are unable to kill staphylococcus aureus even in the presence of extracellular serum, killed s. pyogenes equally effectively whether serum was present or absent. this index proved to be the same as that for killing by monocytes of healthy subjects in the absence of serum. taken together, these results indicate that catalase-negative microorganisms possess some kind of suicide mechanism that leads to the death of these bacteria after their ingestion by monocytes in the absence of an extracellular stimulus. furthermore, the mechanism by which extracellular serum stimulates intracellular killing probably  involves enzymes of the o2-dependent bactericidal mechanisms of the monocytes.

AB  == infection is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in burns. burn wound infection is defined as burn wound bacterial proliferation in a density equal to  or greater than 10(5) bacteria per gram of tissue. gram-negative bacteria, notably pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as staphylococci and fungal opportunists, have been identified as prominent invaders. topical and systemic antimicrobial agents are essential adjuncts in the prevention and treatment of burn wound infection. topical antimicrobial therapy is indicated in all hospitalized burn patients. short-term use of systemic antimicrobials for prophylaxis and treatment is required in all moderate and major burns, specifically for early prophylaxis,  perioperative prophylaxis, and clinical infection. antimicrobial choice is based  on specific patient or environmental bacteriological data.

TI  == studies on antimicrobial agents. 1. synthesis and relation between the antimicrobial activities and certain physicochemical properties of some n'-(pyridinoacetyl) fatty acid hydrazides.
AB  == a new series of n'-(pyridinioacetyl)alkanoic and -benzoic acid hydrazides, as chloride salts, and some cyclic analogues produced ring closure have been synthesize and tested in a search for more effective germicides. physicochemical  parameters, such as surface tension, critical micelle concentration, and thermodynamic activity. (ferguson values), were also determined. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes were the most susceptible of the organisms tested. n'-(pyridinoacetyl)hexadecanoic acid hydrazide exhibited the highest toxicity to staph. aureus and fungi. the mean surface tension of the equitoxic solutions is 59.8 +/- 0.3 dyn/cm for bacteria and 51.65 +/- 0.1 dyn/cm for fungi. n'-(pyridinoacetyl)octadecanoic acid hydrazide and n'-(pyridinoacetyl)-9-ocadecenoic acid hydrazide exhibit the highest toxicity to  s. pyogenes (1.1 x 10(-6) m). the surface tension of their equitoxic solutions and their ferguson values indicate that these compounds may act through a different mechanism.

TI  == qualitative and quantitative methods of studying the effect of lipids on bacteria grown on the surface of solid culture media.
AB  == new qualitative and quantitative methods are described for the investigation of the antibacterial activity of lipids on solid media by the application of lipid-impregnated filter paper over a lawn of the organisms. the methods have been used to investigate the antibacterial activity of unsaturated fatty acids that are important in skin defence. oleic and linoleic acids inhibited streptococcus pyogenes markedly, staphylococcus aureus and staph epidermidis to a lesser extent and had no effect on escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the inhibition of growth of a strain of str. pyogenes from a sore throat was greater than that of a strain from an outbreak of impetigo. linoleic acid was a more potent inhibitor of bacterial growth than oleic acid, and with both acids inhibition was more pronounced under aerobic than under anaerobic conditions of incubation. the methods described could be applied in other fields such as pharmacology, horticulture and industry.

TI  == acute mastoiditis in infants and children.
AB  == during a 25-year period, 57 cases of acute mastoiditis occurred in infants and young children who ranged in age from 2 months to 12 years of age. all patients had abnormalities of the tympanic membrane and most had fever and localized edema and redness of the overlying skin. fifty per cent of the infants who were less than one year of age had swelling primarily above the involved ear pushing the pinna out and down. by contrast, older children had swelling of the skin overlying the mastoid process which produced the classical finding of an elevated earlobe. mastoid roentgenograms were a useful adjunct to diagnosis, revealing concurrent osteomyelitis in 9 patients. a diagnosis of specific bacterial etiology was made in 80 per cent of the patients in whom cultures were performed. streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes were the bacteria most frequently isolated. unusual manifestations or serious complications occurred in 53 per cent of the patients, including one death (due to meningitis). these data indicate that the frequency of serious complications from acute mastoiditis has not declined over the past 3 decades.

TI  == [skin reactions to isolated bacterial cell wall components, bacterial peptidoglycan in particular].
AB  == to elucidate the pathogenetic mechanism of bacterial-allergical diseases and of reactions provoked by bacterial test substances (e.g. the intracutaneous test), it is necessary to analyse carefully various factors involved in these reactions. to try to separate toxic from immunological reactions minute amounts of peptidoglycan in four different preparations were applied to humans by intracutaneous injections. peptidoglycan, an immunologically well defined wall components of almost all bacteria and which is therefore ubiquitous, was isolated from staphylococci and streptococci. the skin reactions were evaluated by macroscopical, microscopical and immunohistological observations, as well as by electromicroscopy and statistical means. several findings indicate the involvement of immunological factors in the observed skin reactions. in some cases no measurable reaction was seen, whereas in others typical skin reactions occurred. similar reactions were produced by the antigenically related peptidoglycans isolated from staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermis.  these reactions differed, however, from those elicited by peptidoglycan preparations from streptococcus pyogenes type a. patients with chronic bacterial  infections and who were injected by four bacterial preparations demonstrated a significant increase in delayed hypersensitivity reaction compared with two other groups of patients (atopic patients without chronic infection). because of the very low test dose, necrotic skin reactions, which occur in animal experiments, were not observed.

AB  == the effect of group a streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin (pe) type c and staphylococcal pe on the in vitro antibody response to sheep erythrocytes was studied in cultures of mouse spleen cells. both exotoxins suppressed the day 4 direct plaque-forming cell response when added to the cultures. the maximum suppression was obtained with 1.0 or 0.1 ng of toxin per culture, and the suppressive effect was reversed by addition of gangliosides to the cultures at the same time as the exotoxins. preincubation of t lymphocytes for 4 days with either exotoxin resulted in the generation of a suppressor cell population, which produced dose-dependent suppression of the direct plaque-forming cell response when added to fresh sheep eyrthrocyte-activated splenocytes. the suppression obtained was not reversed by gangliosides indicating toxin carry-over was not responsible for the effect. b cells, preincubated with exotoxin, failed to suppress the direct plaque-forming cell response of fresh erythrocyte-activated spleen cells.

AB  == a single intraperitoneal injection of the phenol-treated cells of propionibacterium acnes into mice showed nonspecific resistance against subsequent lethal doses of an intraperitoneal challenge of klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pyogenes. the protection showed a biphasic pattern. the maximum protection, designated as the early phase protection, was seen in mice injected with p. acnes vaccine 1 to 2 days before the challenge, whereas the late phase protection was seen in mice vaccinated 16 to 22 days before the challenge. the activity of the reticuloendothelial system in mice after vaccination also showed a biphasic pattern with the peak on days 4  and 12. the delayed activation of the reticuloendothelial system lasted up to 3 weeks and coincided with the period of the late phase protection. the early phase resistance was markedly impaired by the treatment with hydrocortisone and carrageenan, but not by the treatment with anti-thymocyte serum, actinomycin d, or cyclophosphamide. the number of peritoneal polymorphonuclear leukocytes in vaccinated mice increased on days 1 to 2. the number of macrophages also increased at 2 to 21 days after vaccination and reached its maximum on day 14. total activities of acid phosphatase, nitro blue tetrazolium reduction, and the phagocytic activities of peritoneal exudate cells were also enhanced on and after day 1 after the injection of p. acnes vaccine.

TI  == antibacterial properties of dilute formocresol and eugenol and propylene glycol.
AB  == formocresol and eugenol are the two nonspecific intracanal medicaments commonly used in endodontic practice. both have high tissue irritation potential when used in conventional strength. propylene glycol is an alcohol that is injectable and itself possesses significant antibacterial action. it is a popular vehicle and hence was used to modify the two drugs. standard bacteriologic methods were employed to test the antibacterial action of these lower concentrations of the two drugs against four test organisms. the investigations indicate that formocresol at as low as 10 to 20% and eugenol at 75% are bactericidal in action  and hence may be useful at these concentrations for clinical use. evaluation of these lower concentrations is warranted for possible clinical use. propylene glycol, which possesses antibacterial action and is remarkably innocuous to tissues, appears to be a suitable vehicle for dilution of formocresol and eugenol.

TI  == bactericidal effect of oleic acid on group a streptococci: mechanism of action.
AB  == in contrast to staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, group  a streptococci are infrequently present on normal human skin, except in certain populations with endemic impetigo. this has been attributed to differences in susceptibility to the bactericidal effect of skin surface lipids, particularly unsaturated fatty acids. when an m type 6 strain group a streptococcus was exposed to 500 mug of oleic acid per ml, viable counts decreased by 4 logs in 5 min. the rank order of killing was 35 > 20 > 4 degrees c. oleic acid did not kill a strain of s. aureus, a strain of coagulase-negative staphylococcus, or a strain of escherichia coli, but bound rapidly to these bacteria as well as to the group  a streptococcus. the loss of [(3)h]uridine from labeled oleic acid-treated group  a streptococcal cells was greater than 100 times that of controls. there was no loss of [(3)h]-thymidine from group a streptococci or of [(3)h]uridine or [(3)h]thymidine from identically exposed coagulase-negative staphylococci. when [(3)h]uridine was added to group a streptococci during mid-log-phase growth, cessation of uptake occurred within 5 min of addition of 50 mug of oleic acid per ml. electron microscopic changes seen within 5 min included condensation of the nucleoid and distortion of the streptococcal surface by numerous clumps and blebs. coagulase-negative staphylococci, s. aureus, and e. coli similarly exposed showed no comparable electron microscopic changes. we propose that oleic acid kills group a streptococci by altering the integrity of the cell membrane with resulting loss of ribonucleic acid but not deoxyribonucleic acid.

TI  == in vitro activity of ly127935.
AB  == ly127935 is a unique new beta-lactam antibiotic. its activity against 536 clinical isolates was studied by using microdilution methods of susceptibility testing and compared with the activities of cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cephalothin. the lowest concentrations required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (mic(90)s) of ly127935 for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae ranged from 2 to 8 mug/ml. the mic(90)s for other staphylococci and streptococci were higher. the  mic(90)s for enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas species ranged from 0.12 to 8 mug/ml and 8 to >32 mug/ml, respectively. the mic(90)s for anaerobes ranged from  2 to >32 mug/ml. as determined by mic(90)s, ly127935 was consistently the least active antibiotic against facultatively anaerobic gram-positive cocci and the most active against aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. its position with respect to activity against anaerobes varied from being the most active against bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens to the least active against anaerobic cocci. in a population of multidrug-resistant isolates,  concentrations of 8 mug or less of ly127935 per ml inhibited 82% of enterobacteriaceae; concentrations of 32 mug or less per ml inhibited 100% of enterobacteriaceae and 40% of p. aeruginosa. increasing the inoculum size by 100-fold did not increase the minimal inhibitory concentrations of ly127935 or cefoxitin but did increase minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefamandole and cephalothin for some enterobacteriaceae. all four drugs were bactericidal; minimal bactericidal concentrations were the same or one concentration higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations for 91 to 96% of strains tested. the broad spectrum and marked in vitro activity of ly127935 make it a promising new antibiotic.

AB  == the bactericidal and bacteriolytic effects of lysolecithin (ll) and egg-white lysozyme (lyz) on staph. aureus and group a streptococci and the solubilization of phospholipids from the bacterial membranes by these agents was studied. low concentrations of lysolecithin (1--10 microgrames/ml) are highly bactericidal for steph. aureus and group a streptococci, but induce neither bacteriolysis nor solubilization of a substantial amount of membrane phospholipids. on the other hand, while ll at greater than 50 micrograms/ml causes substantial lipid release, a combination of ll and lyz is absolutely needed to solubilize lipids from streptococci. this combination is, however, not bacteriolytic for this microrganism. the solubilization of lipids from staphylococci by ll is much faster than that induced in streptococci by ll + lyz. the solubilization of the bulk of membrane lipids from staphylococci can also be achieved by triton x-100 and by sodium lauryl sulfate and from group a streptococci by triton x-100 plus lyz. a variety of other detergents (e.g., cetavlon, sodium taurocholate, cetyl pyrdinium chloride) have no lipid-releasing properties even in the presence of lyz. the release of lipids by lyz (in the presence of ll) from group a streptococci is related to its enzymatic activity, on a still unknown substrate,  but not to its cationic nature as this muramidase cannot be replaced by a variety of cation substances (histone, polylysin, leukocyte cationic proteins, polymyxin  b, and spermidine). the release of lipids from staphylococci by ll is not inhibited by a variety of anionic and cationic polyelectrocytes (heparin, liquoid, chondroitin sulfate, dna histone, and polylysine) which markedly inhibit the release of lipids from group a streptococci by ll and lyz. streptococci that  had been cultivated in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of penicillin g lose their membrane phospholipids to a larger extent and by much smaller concentrations of ll and lyz, as compared to controls, suggesting that the interference with the synthesis of the peptidoglycan increases the accessibility  of the cell membrane to the lipid-releasing agents. the mechanism by which ll collaborates with lyz in lipid release is still not known. the possible role of bacterial lipids and lyso compounds in the control of bacterial survival in inflammatory sites is briefly discussed.

TI  == bacterial tracheitis.
AB  == during a 14-month period, eight infants and children were observed with an acute, infectious, upper airway obstructive disease with features common to both croup and epiglottitis. we have termed this distinct entity "bacterial tracheitis." all patients failed to respond to treatment for croup, including racemic epinephrine  delivered by intermittent positive-pressure breathing. direct laryngoscopy consistently revealed a normal epiglottis and aryepiglottic folds but marked subglottic mucosal edema. tracheal suctioning yielded copius mucopus below the subglottic swelling. gram stain of this material corroborated subsequent cultures: staphylococcus aureus, six; group a streptococcus, one; and haemophilus influenzae (not typed), one. all patients required periodic tracheal suctioning for relief of upper airway obstruction. six patients required endotracheal intubation; one required a tracheostomy. bacterial tracheitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a young child with a croup-like illness that is refractory to conventional therapy.

TI  == bactericidal activity of cefadroxil, cephalexin, and cephradine in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model.
AB  == cefadroxil (duricef, mead johnson and company), resembles cephalexin and cephradine in spectrum of antibacterial activity but differs in human pharmacokinetic properties. whether the latter are likely to affect activity in vivo was assessed by determining bactericidal activity against clinical isolates  under conditions simulating the variation of drug concentration in the blood stream after an oral dose of 500 mg to adults. in this kinetic model, cefadroxil  was more active than cephalexin or cephradine against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and one of two strains of escherichia coli. the other strain of e. coli was virtually unaffected by the cephalosporins. s. pyogenes was equally susceptible to all three cephalosporins. analysis of the results suggest that the pharmocokinetic properties of an antibiotic affect its activity in the blood stream, provided the susceptibility of the infecting organism is concentration-dependent within the range of drug concentration occurring in serum.

TI  == specific absorption of human serum albumin, immunoglobulin a, and immunoglobulin  g with selected strains of group a and g streptococci.
AB  == five gram-positive bacterial strains were selected for absorption studies of human serum samples. strain ar1 (group a, m-type 1) and g148 (group g), with strong immunoglobulin g (igg) binding capacities, and strain aw43 (group a, m-type 60), binding both iga1 and iga2, were compared with staphylococcus aureus  cowan i and with staphylococcus epidermidis l603. both ar1 and g148 were capable  of completely absorbing out serum igg. in contrast, s. aureus cowan i left a fraction unabsorbed, as expected from its known lack of igg3 binding. strain aw43 absorbed out all serum iga, using a 10-microliter bacterial pellet for 20 microliter of serum. serum igm levels were slightly reduced by s. aureus cowan i  absorption. on the basis of the experiments, a bacterial mixture was designed consisting of s. aureus cowan i and group a streptococcus strains ar1 and aw43, with absorption characteristics suitable for use in discriminating between early  igm and late igg and iga immune responses in routine serological work. a new type of bacteria-mammalian protein binding was discovered. human serum albumin was completely absorbed out by strain g148 and to a lesser extent by strain ar1 and aw43. s. aureus cowan i and s. epidermidis were negative. the binding capacity of g148 for albumin equalled that of cowan i for igg. the binding pattern of albumin to the strains was different from those of igg, iga, igm, fibrinogen, haptoglobin, or aggregated beta 2-microglobulin and therefore seems to represent  another type of bacterial-mammalian interaction with a specific albumin receptor  on the surface of streptococci.

AB  == previous investigations have shown that cross-contamination in a burn unit is mainly clothes-borne. new barrier garments have been designed and tried experimentally. the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of different clothing routines on cross-contamination. in a long-term study, the rates and routes of colonizations with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus groups a, b, c, f, and g and pseudomonas aeruginosa were examined. the exogenous  colonization rates were, with s. aureus 77%, with streptococcus species 52% and with ps. aeruginosa 32%. the colonization rate with ps. aeruginosa was higher in  patients with larger burns. patients dispersed streptococcus and ps. aeruginosa as well as s. aureus into the air of their rooms in considerable amounts, but dispersers were not more important as sources of cross-colonization than non-dispersers. in comparison of clothing routines, there was no difference in overall colonization rates. the newly designed barrier garment that was made from apparently particle-tight material did not reduce the transfer of bacteria from patient to patient. a less rigid routine than that previously used did not increase the risk of cross-contamination. a thorough change of barrier dress after close contact nursing delayed the first exogenous s. aureus colonization from day 6 to day 14 after admission. this routine might be recommended for clinical use. otherwise, methods must be developed for adequate selection of materials intended for barrier garments.

AB  == acute pyogenic infections of the skin, caused by hemolytic streptococci and s. aureus, account for the vast majority of bacterial infections of the skin seen in ambulatory practice. in preschool children the principal manifestation is pyoderma, which is usually caused by group a streptococcus. in this age group pyoderma regularly responds to systemic penicillin therapy plus adjunctive local  care to the lesions. however, in older age groups, the ability to distinguish streptococcal from staphylococcal skin infections on the basis of clinical features alone is poor, and penicillin treatment failures are more common. safe,  effective antibiotics that are effective against both staphylococci and streptococci are readily available. for this reason penicillinase-resistant semisynthtic penicillins and or erythromycin can be used to treat acute pyogenic  skin infections in older age groups.

AB  == topical antibiotics are under attack by critics who claim that no proof of efficacy exists and that systemic administration is far more effective. in this paper, we review the existing evidence and conclude that topical antibiotics have a place in the prevention and treatment of superficial skin infections. our own experimental studies showed that topical antibiotics promptly reduce the density  of staphylococcus aureus in secondarily infected chronic dermatoses, associated with clinical improvement. in addition, topical antibiotics were shown to be highly effective in preventing and suppressing experimental s. aureus infections  in human volunteers.

TI  == [restriction of washing and its effect to the normal human skin flora. quantitative and qualitative investigations of the aerobic skin flora (author's transl)].
AB  == the behaviour of the aerobic skin flora of the flexor sides of the forearms, under a three-week restriction of washing, was investigated in twenty-four patients for its quantitative and qualitative aspects. the combined scrabbing-washing method was used as described by burtenshaw with ringer's solution. after a three-week restriction of washing, using the wilcoxon test, statistically no significant changes in the total number of microorganisms were found in areas investigated in the intermittent sampling of the skin flora. a three-week restriction of washing in the region of the flexor sides of the forearms does not induce significant changes in the composition of the normal aerobic skin flora. the percentage of differences in the total number of bacteria fluctuates up to the mark in wide limits; statements about standard deviations are not permitted because of the technical and experimental conditions. there was no shifting of the resident flora to other groups of bacteria in the patients under study. pathogenic microorganisms could not be found in higher numbers after the second sampling.

TI  == synthesis and biological activity of new 2-nitroimidazole derivatives.
AB  == in an earlier paper we described the synthesis and the antitrichomonas activity of 2-nitro-alpha,alpha,1-trimethyl-1h-imidazole-5-methanol (2). starting from this compound, several derivatives have been synthesized. among these, the phenyl carbonate 8 has been shown to possess activity equal to that of 2 and to be less  toxic. this compound therefore is interesting in comparison with some antitrichomonas agents currently in use clinically. before undertaking an in-depth investigation, compound 8 was subjected to some studies to see whether it has any effects on the central nervous system (cns). preliminary results show  that, at therapeutic doses, it might induce unwanted cns effects to a lesser degree than metronidazole.

TI  == bacteria induce lymphokine synthesis polyclonally in human b lymphocytes.
AB  == we have studied the ability of various bacteria to stimulate human lymphocytes to produce leukocyte migration inhibitory factor (lif). mononuclear cells from adult and cord blood as well as purified t and b lymphocytes were stimulated with killed bacteria. the culture supernatants were tested for the presence of lif by  the agarose migration method. all nine bacterial strains tested activated unseparated mononuclear cells and b lymphocytes but not t cells to produce lif. lif was also present in cord blood cell cultures suggesting that the stimulation  of lymphocytes was polyclonal rather than antigenic. therefore, we propose that one of the physiologic functions of b lymphocyte lymphokines might be to form part of the nonspecific defense mechanisms against microbial invasion.

AB  == immunological mechanisms are involved in the thrombocytolytic activity of peptidoglycan of group a streptococcus, streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus. inactivation of particular components of complement (heating of blood serum to 56 degrees c,incubation with zymosan or nh4oh) inhibited the thrombocytolytic activity of group a streptococcus peptidoglycan. so did preincubation of group a streptococcus peptidoglycan with homologous antipeptidoglycan antibody. on the other hand, antibody to group a streptococcus  peptidoglycan did not inhibit the thrombocytolytic effect of streptococcus pneumoniae or staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan. human platelets are resistant  to peptidoglycans. they remain resistant in the presence of rabbit serum although rabbit platelets are highly sensitive to peptidoglycans. this suggests that, for  the expression of the thrombocytolytic activity of bacterial peptidoglycan, specific receptors on the surface of platelets must be present in addition to serum factors.

TI  == peripheral dissemination of bacteria in contaminated wounds; role of devitalized  tissue: evaluation of therapeutic measures.
AB  == the role of available therapeutic agents in the management of infection has long  been a continuing source of debate. this study assessed the rapidity of lateral dissemination of three common pyogenic organisms from wounds. the streptococcus spreads peripherally with greater speed than the staphylococcus or e. coli. appraisal of the role and effectiveness of jet wound irrigation, debridement, and penicillin provides firm evidence that, of these three therapeutic agents, the only one that can control bacterial proliferation in a contaminated wound is the  antibiotic. the primary role of energized jet irrigation is to remove clots and wound debris. the specific function of debridement is removal of devitalized tissue, in which role it has no effective competitor. these studies demonstrate that devitalized tissue in a contaminated wound quickens the rapidity of peripheral spread of all three micro-organisms. systemic penicillin plus saline irrigation is the most effective therapeutic measure at both the second and fourth postinoculation hours in nondevitalized contaminated wounds. debridement proved to be the most effective therapeutic device at the second, fourth, and sixth postinoculation hours in devitalized wounds.

TI  == selective adsorption of heterophile polyglycerophosphate antigen from antigen extracts of streptococcus mutans and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == hot saline extracts of streptococcus mutans have been shown to contain antigenic  substances which occasionally react nonspecifically with some antisera against whole cells of various serological groups and types of streptococci. chromatography of the extract of s. mutans strain mt703 (serotype e) on a diethylaminoethyl-sephadex a-25 column gave two principal antigens. one antigen was eluted without adsorption to the resin and was identified as the serotype-specific polysaccharide. the other antigen, which contained a large quantity of phosphorus, was absorbed to and released from the resin by gradient elution. it was reactive against the antisera specific for polyglycerophosphate (pgp) from group a streptococcus pyogenes and/or s. mutans strain ingbritt (type  c). the pgp antigen was further purified by gel filtration with sephadex g-75. two peaks, pgp-1, and pgp-2, were obtained. each possessed the same antigenic specificity to anti-pgp serum as shown by immunodiffusion. chemical analyses revealed that the molar ratio of phosphorus to glycerol in both was about 1:1, although the protein content between the two was significantly different. pgp antigen was found to be widely distributed in hot saline extracts from various gram-positive bacteria, with a few exceptions. however, all gram-negative bacteria examined were free of pgp. the pgp in the hot saline extracts of various gram-positive bacteria possessed an essentially identical antigenic specificity.  the addition of diethylaminoethyl-sephadex a-25 resin to hot saline extracts successfully removed the cross-reacting pgp antigen. after adsorption of the extract from s. mutans, the supernatant contained only type-specific polysaccharide antigen, except type b, in which both type b-specific polysaccharide and pgp antigens were absorbed with the resin. this simple procedure should be useful for the removal of the pgp-type teichoic acid from antigen extracts of bacteria that contain uncharged polysaccharides.

TI  == decadron in the treatment of cerebral abscess. an experimental study.
AB  == forty rabbits were inoculated with streptococcus pyogenes or staphylococcus aureus to produce cerebral abscesses. one-third of the rabbits received no treatment and served as controls. one-third received dexamethasone (decadron) plus an appropriate antibiotic. one-third received only the appropriate antibiotic in the same dosage. the animals were sacrificed 10 days after inoculation and the brains examined. in the control group, an abscess at the stage of granulation tissue encapsulation containing the inoculated organisms was found. the surrounding brain showed a marked inflammatory response. in the decadron plus antibiotic group, necrotic lesions were found containing the inoculated organisms and surrounded by relatively normal brain. in the group treated with antibiotic alone, healed glial scars were found in relatively normal brain. our findings are discussed with reference to the medical literature regarding the influence of glucocorticoids on the inflammatory response and the efficacy of antibiotics when this response is suppressed.

AB  == growth inhibitory effect of combined treatment of tetracycline (tc) and oleandomycin (om), at a ratio of 2:1, on certain species of pathogenic bacteria including drug-resistant ones was examined. by the crossed paper strip method, synergistic effects were demonstrated against 9 of the 16 strains of staphylococcus aureus, and all of the 5 strains of escherichia coli studied. antagonism was observed with none of the strains and with 2 strains of streptococcus pyogenes and 2 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae tested in the present experiments. the mics determined by the agar dilution method, also gave similar results, although synergism was not conclusively demonstrated by this method. with representative strains of s. aureus, synergism was evidenced by quantitative measurement of growth inhibition. in some strains, 1.0 mug of one drug per ml of medium inhibited the induction of resistance to the second drug. such a small dose of one drug also inhibited the development of a mutant resistant to the second drug. these inhibitory actions were thought to be one of  the important factors causing the synergistic effect of tc and om on drug resistant bacteria.

TI  == tobramycin: a review of its antibacterial and pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic use.
AB  == synopsis: tobramycin is a new aminoglycoside antibiotic with a broad antibacterial spectrum in vitro, and pharmacokinetic properties similar to those  for gentamicin. tobramycin is more active than gentamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa and active against many gentamicin resistant strains, but is not active against enterobacteriaceae resistant to gentamicin. theoretically, tobramycin has an advantage over gentamicin against infections caused by p. aeruginosa, but any advantage in clinical practice has yet to be adequately demonstrated. clinical experience with tobramycin is considerably less than with  gentamicin. whilst tobramycin appears to offer no clear advantages over gentamicin against sensitive organisms it is indicated in infection caused by strains of p. aeruginosa which are resistant to gentamicin, but sensitive to tobramycin. like gentamicin, tobramycin acts synergistically with corbenicillin and the cephalosporins. the efficacy of the tobramycin-carbenicillin combination  has been shown in endocarditis caused by p. aeruginosa which was unresponsive to  gentamicin plus carbenicillin. ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity similar to that seen with other animoglycosides have been encountered in therapeutic trials with  tobramycin and wider clinical experience is necessary to determine the relative incidence of these side-effects with gentamicin and tobramycin used under similar conditions. antimicrobial activity: in comparative studies, in vitro, tobramycin  is more active than gentamicin against clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa. similarly, the inhibitory index, which is the ratio between the serum concentration attained at usual therapuetic doses and the minimum inhibitory concentration, for pseudomonas aeruginosa is higher for tobramycin than for gentamicin. against gram-negative bacteria other than pseudomonas spp. the spectrum of activity of tobramycin is similar to that of gentamicin. for most species the activity of tobramycin is slightly less than that of gentamicin. gentamicin is consistently more active than tobramycin against serratia marcescens. like other aminoglycoside antibiotics, tobramycin is active in vitro  in low concentrations against staphylococcus aureus. tobramycin is essentially inactive against streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus faecalis and streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci). maner aminoglycosides and of other antibiotics against  various bacteria in vitro, but comparisons between studies cannot always be interpreted literally because the activity of many antibiotics in vitro, including tobramycin, is influenced by the nature of the culture media and the presence of certain salts. the sensitivity of p. aeruginosa to tobramycin is influenced by the magnesium, and calcium content of the culture media whilst that of all species is reduced by sodium ions. wide variations in the concentration of these ions may result in divergent mic values and an inappropriate choice of antibacterial agent to treat pseudomonas infection...

AB  == an extracellular bacteriocidal substance is produced by a serotype c strain of streptococcus mutans in liquid meduim during the stationary phase of growth. the  lethal effect of the substance was demonstrated by the decrease in viable counts  of a standardized suspension of group a streptococci in broth. no lysis of affected cells was observed and no changes in appearance of these cells was seen  in electron micrographs. the material was effective against certain strains of immmunological groups a, c, d, g, h, l, and o streptococci. it was inactive against strains of s. mutans belonging to the a, b, c, and d serotypes, bacillus  subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli. the factor was purified 273-fold from the culture fluid by column chromatography. it was sensitive to trysin and pronase and resistant to catalase. it possessed a  molecular weight of more than 20,000 and was not dialyzable. the properties of this substance indicate that it is a bacteriocin. group a streptococci, which had been treated with antiserum specific for the cell wall group and type antigens, were susceptible to the bacteriocin. streptococcal strains resistant to the lethal action of the bacteriocin adsorbed the bacteriocin from the solutions, as  did the sensitive cells. the bacteriocin was not adsorbed at 0 c.

TI  == adherence of bacteria to heart valves in vitro.
AB  == the abilities of 14 strains of aerobic gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli to adhere in vitro to human or canine aortic valve leaflets were compared. 2-mm sections of excised valve leaflets were obtained by punch biopsy and were incubated under standardized conditions in suspensions of bacteria. valve sections were subsequently washed and homogenized, and quantitative techniques were used to determine the proportions of bacteria from the initial suspensions that had adhered to the valve sections. comparable results were obtained when these adherence ratios were determined by two independent methods based either on measurements of bacterial viability or of radioactivity in 51cr-labeled bacteria. for each bacterial strain, the adherence ratio was constant over a wide range of concentrations of bacteria in the incubation medium. strains of enterococci, viridans streptococci, coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa (adherence ratios 0.003-0.017) were found to adhere more readily to valve sections than strains of  escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae (adherence ratios 0.00002-0.00004). the organisms that most frequently cause bacterial endocarditis were found to adhere best to heart valves in vitro, suggesting that the ability to adhere to valvular endothelium may be an important or essential charcteristic of bacteria that cause endocarditis in man.

AB  == bacterial and fungal growth in 10% soybean oil emulsion (intralipid) and 5% fibrin hydrolysate in 5% dextrose was studied at 4, 25 and 37 degrees c. staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, str. fecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli and candida albicans were grown in broth at 37 degrees c, diluted in saline and inoculated into each of the two preparations as well as a mixture of the two. growth was measured at 24, 48 and 72 hours. in 10% soybean emulsion, all bacteria except s. pyogenes multiplied, but in fibrin hydrolysate-dextrose solution the only organism of those studied to grow was s. aureus. in the hydrolysate-dextrose-lipid mixture, all organisms multiplied except s. pyogenes and p. aeruginosa. c. albicans grew in all solutions tested. while at 4 degrees c, organisms did not multiply. the fibrin hydrolysate-dextrose solutions given by infusion into a central vein for hyperalimentation have been shown to support predominantly fungal growth, and contamination of the solution and ultimately of the indwelling catheter is a constant hazard. because both bacteria and c. albicans grew equally well in 10% soybean oil emulsion, its use as a caloric source when infused into a central vein may increase the occurrence of sepsis. when this emulsion is used to provide essential fatty acids or calories, it should be given via a peripheral vein, so that a central catheter will not be contaminated.

TI  == systematic difference in the methylation of ribosomal ribonucleic acid from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == a survey of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was performed to compare the distributionof n6-methylated adenine. it was found that (i) all the gram-positive strains tested, staphylococcus aureus, sarcina lutea, bacillus stearothermophilus, bacillus subtilis, and bacillus megaterium, contain neither n6-monomethyl adenine (m6a) nor n6-dimethyladenine (m26a) in 23s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rrna). in the case of s. aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, strains which are clinically resistant to erythromycin contain m26a. (ii) the gram-negative strains salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae all contain m6a but  not m23a in 23s rrna. these observations suggest the existence of at least one systematic structural difference between the ribosomes of the two classes of bacteria. because of the demonstrated relationship between n6-dimethylation of adenine in 23s rrna and clinical resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b-type antibiotics in staphylococci and streptococci, the observed  systematic differences found in rrna methylation combined with greater cellular permeability may be related to the relatively greater efficacy of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b-type antibiotics in treating infections caused by gram-positive organisms.

TI  == migration inhibition of peritoneal macrophages by peptidoglycan.
AB  == previous studies have shown that peptidoglycans from group a and b streptococci inhibit the migration of peritoneal exudate cells from non-sensitized rats and guinea pigs. in the present studies peptidoglycans from s. aureus and s. epidermidis were found to inhibit the migration of cells to the same extent as group a streptococcal peptidoglycan. in contrast, hsa-pentapeptide, an immunologically active synthetic analog of the peptide moiety of peptidoglycan which is free of the intrinsic toxicity of naturally occurring peptidoglycans, did not induce migration inhibition of peritoneal exudate cells from non-sensitized guinea pigs. sensitization of animals with 200 mug hsa-pentapeptide emulsified in incomplete freund's adjuvant significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of streptococcal and staphylococcal peptidoglycan; hsa-pentapeptide again showed no activity. however, when hsa-pentapeptide was tested against cells from animals sensitized with 200 mug hsa-pentapeptide incorporated in complete freund's adjuvant, a strong inhibition of migration was  evident. skin tests performed in these animals, in contrast to the dermonecrotic  reaction elicited by streptococcal or staphylococcal peptidoglycan, revealed a characteristic delay hypersensitivity to hsa-pentapeptide.

TI  == the thrombocytolytic activity of bacterial peptidoglycans.
AB  == the peptidoglycan of group a streptococcus prepared by hot formamide or tca extraction has an expressive ability to lyse rabbit blood platelets in vitro. initial changes in the ultrastructure of platelets can be observed after 10 minutes incubation of rabbit platelets with 0.1 mug of streptococcus peptidoglycan per ml. the submicroscopic alterations are characterized by changes of the shape and damage of the limiting membrane of the platelets. larger amounts of peptidoglycan (10 mug/ml and more) cause total destruction of platelets; only  remainders of the limiting membrane and free granulomers can be seen. peptidoglycans of streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus exhibit a comparable effect on rabbit platelets. there are substantial differences in the sensitivity of blood platelets of different animal species to the streptococcal peptidoglycan. rat platelets exhibit a similar thrombocytolytic effect after the  streptococcus peptidoglycan treatment as rabbit ones; however, the development of comparable changes in their submicroscopic structure needs a dose of peptidoglycan 10(2)-10(3) times higher. platelets of guinea-pig, dog, cat, calf and human appear to be quite resistant under analogous conditions to as such a high dose of streptococcus peptidoglycan as 500 mug/ml.

TI  == endotoxin-like properties of the peptidoglycan.
AB  == peptidoglycan is responsible for the endotoxin-like properties of the streptococcus cell wall. the pyrogenic response of rabbit to group a streptococcus peptidoglycan prepared by hot formamide or tca is dose-dependent and is increased if the material is ultrasonically solubilized. the pyrogenicity  can be eliminated by the antiserum to the peptidoglycan or by the degradation of  the material by lysozyme. peptidoglycans prepared from cell walls of group b and  l streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pneumoniae produce fever effects comparable to the response after group a streptococcus peptidoglycan. spirillum serpens and escherichia coli contain in addition to endotoxin the peptidoglycan which is also pyrogenic. repeated injections of bacterial peptidoglycan to rabbit result in tolerance to the fever effect. cross-tolerance was recorded only exceptionally. rabbits tolerant to endotoxin respond with a lower fever to s. aureus and group a streptococcus peptidoglycans. intravenous administration of peptidoglycan to rabbit causes extensive alterations in the heart characterized by various stages  of the degenerative and necrotic process. local shwartzman reaction can be elicited in rabbit by peptidoglycan used either as a preparative or as a provocative dose in combination with endotoxin, or it can be used for both doses. the results obtained with peptidoglycans prepared from various bacteria are fully comparable. non-specific resistance of mice to infection induced by streptococcus cell walls was found to be dependent on the peptidoglycan activity; cell wall proteins and polysaccharide are inactive. these properties of peptidoglycan resemble those known from endotoxin studies. the data presented suggest the role  of peptidoglycan in pathological reactions resulting from host-parasite interaction.

AB  == the purification and characterization of the streptolytic exo-enzyme from the maxted-mccarty strain of streptomyces albus is described. this enzyme was shown to be an endo-n-acetylmuramidase with a molecular weight of 10 to 12,000 and optimal activity at ph 8 and 45 degrees c. the enzyme is lytic for streptococci of various groups, micrococcus lysodeikticus, staphylococcus aureus, as well as escherichia coli. it closely resembles the f1 endo-n-acetylmuramidase described by ghuysen et al. (1966) except for small differences in the products of lysis of streptococcal cell walls and the resistance of escherichia coli to lysis by the f1 enzyme. lysates of group a and a variant streptococcal cell walls prepared with purified streptomyces albus muramidase contained serologically active m protein and c carbohydrate-peptidoglycan complexes. the chemical and immunological characteristics of these enzymmatic products of streptococcal cell  walls are reported and their utility as immunologic reagents is described.

TI  == the bacteriological ecosystem of the skin of children in an african tropical envirovment (tanzania).
AB  == using a standardized method for sampling, the aerobic microbial flora of the skin of ninety-five children in dar es salaam, tanzania, was studied qualitatively and quantitatively. the subjects comprised three groups; group a, thirty-seven normal infants (below the age of 1 year); group b, twenty-nine infants with various bacterial skin lesions; and group c, twenty-nine nursery school children between  4-5 and 7 years. the following observations were made: (i) the quantitative results indicated; (a) great variation between individuals, which was more marked among the females; (b) lower bacterial counts in infants than in older children;  (c) counts were not affected by the presence of infection or state of cleanliness; (d) there were some differences between females and males and between different ethnic groups. (2) qualitatively, the types of organisms isolated were similar to those reported elsewhere. there were differences in carrier rates of many organisms but these were most striking with staphylococcus  aureus and staph. albus. it is concluded that there are great differences in carrier rates between persons in a tropical african environment and those studied elsewhere. these difference may be due to environmental, geographical or ethnic factors. such observations call for more studies in this area to establish the normal flora.

TI  == interaction of clindamycin and gentamicin in vitro.
AB  == the minimal inhibitory concentrations of clindamycin and gentamicin alone and in  combinations were determined by a microdilution method for 163 aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic clinical isolates. all 77 strains of staphylococcus aureus, diplococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and anaerobic bacteria (except for three strains of clostridium) were inhibited by 1.6 mug or less of clindamycin per ml. gentamicin did not interfere with the activity of clindamycin within the range of concentrations tested (0.1 to 100 mug/ml); for some strains combinations were synergistic. sixty-two (94%) of 66 strains of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by 6.2 mug or less of gentamicin per ml. combinations of clindamycin and gentamicin were indifferent for 29 strains and synergistic for 33 strains. all 20 strains of enterococcus, three strains of clostridium, three strains of escherichia coli, and one strain of proteus rettgeri were resistant to both clindamycin (minimal inhibitory concentration greater than 3.1 mug/ml) and gentamicin (minimal inhibitory concentration greater than 6.2 mug/ml). combinations of clindamycin and gentamicin were indifferent for 16 and synergistic for 11 of the resistant strains. except for clindamycin-sensitive isolates, synergy was usually observed  only at concentrations of one or both drugs which are not readily obtainable in vivo. antagonism was never observed.

AB  == comparative plate counts were made of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes growing on blood agar supplemented with individual chemicals to abolish  the swarming of proteus. b-phenylethanol, sodium azide, and p-nitrophenyl glycerin (pnpg) were used as anti-swarm agents. each anti-swarm agent effectively abolished swarming for 24 h, but azide failed to control swarming for longer periods of incubation. in addition, azide displayed growth inhibition towards the staphylococci and streptococci resulting in no hemolysis and reduced viable cell  numbers with the streptococci. phenylethanol showed reduced viable cell numbers with the streptococci and unreliable hemolytic reactions. at 0.1 to 0.3 mm, pnpg  proved to be a superior anti-swarm agent in that it showed no growth inhibition and allowed normal hemolysis, but abolished swarming for extended periods of time. when laboratory strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa. listeria monocytogenes, and vibrio cholerae were screened on a blood agar medium containing 0.1 mm pnpg, they displayed similar growth and  hemolytic characteristics to the identical medium without pnpg.

TI  == effect of elevated atmospheric pressure on penicillin binding by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == a gas pressure of 68 atm, elicited by helium-oxygen gas mixtures, reduced the susceptibility to penicillin of staphylococcus aureus but not of streptococcus pyogenes. the elevated pressure also caused a reduction in the binding of (14)c-penicillin to s. aureus, but not to s. pyogenes. when these studies were extended to glycine incorporation, it was shown that, even without penicillin, pressurization reduced glycine incorporation into the cell wall of s. aureus. incorporation into other cellular components was not altered by pressurization. cells grown in a pressurized environment were slightly more susceptible than those grown at 1 atm to rapid change in osmotic pressure. in the presence of penicillin, glycine incorporation into the cell wall was reduced to the same low  level at 68 atm and at 1 atm. these results suggest that pressurization renders s. aureus less susceptible to penicillin because it reduces the enzymatic activity of the binding component on the cell, a penicillin-sensitive transpeptidase.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of four aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin, sch 13706, tobramycin, and sisomicin) was tested against eight gram-negative and three gram-positive species. a total of 323 strains were studied by the broth dilution technique. tobramycin and sisomicin had greater bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity against pseudomonas strains than did gentamicin and sch 13706. of the four antibiotics, sisomicin was most active against klebsiella, enterobacter, escherichia coli, indole-negative and -positive proteus, and streptococcus pyogenes. gentamicin was most effective against serratia. a fourfold or greater difference existed frequently between the minimal inhibitory  and bactericidal concentrations of all antibiotics against enterobacter and serratia. this difference was greatest with tobramycin. staphylococcus aureus was highly susceptible, providencia relatively resistant, and enterococcus uniformly  resistant to the antibiotics studied. agar diffusion susceptibility testing with  gentamicin and tobramycin showed that organisms susceptible to less than 6.2 mug/ml usually yielded zones 17 to 26 mm in diameters. zones of 15 to 16 mm represented intermediate susceptibility which varied with the organism and antibiotic. several serratia strains required 6.2 to 12.5 mug of gentamicin/ml or 25 to 50 mug of tobramycin/ml for bactericidal activity despite minimal inhibitory concentrations of 0.09 to 3.1 mug/ml and zone sizes greater than 13 and 17 mm, respectively. studies with enterobacter and tobramycin yielded similar results.

TI  == carbenicillin indanyl sodium, an orally active derivative of carbenicillin.
AB  == carbenicillin indanyl sodium, an orally active derivative of carbenicillin, is active against a broad spectrum of bacterial species. although the ester has in vitro antimicrobial activity per se when evaluated in brain heart infusion broth, the in vivo antibacterial activity seen in mice and rats reflects primarily the efficient hydrolysis of the ester to carbenicillin. with an acute systemic infection in mice as a test system, orally administered carbenicillin indanyl sodium protected mice against lethal infections produced by escherichia coli, salmonella choleraesuis, pasteurella multocida, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus  aureus, and streptococcus pyogenes. the dose that protected 50% of the animals against each of these infections was comparable to that of parenteral carbenicillin. against experimental urinary-tract disease in rats produced by e.  coli, p. vulgaris, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, it was again observed that carbenicillin indanyl sodium provided activity comparable to that of parenterally administered carbenicillin.

AB  == 7-[alpha-(1-methyl-4-pyridiniothio)-acetamido] cephalosporanic acid, referred to  herein as bl-s 217, is a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic cephalosporin that offers several advantages over cephalothin. a comparison of the activity in vitro of these antibiotics indicates that bl-s 217 is about eightfold more effective against streptococcus pyogenes and diplococcus pneumoniae. against gram-negative  bacteria, bl-s 217 possesses a broader antibacterial spectrum than cephalothin, particularly against members of the enterobacteriaceae family; e.g., bl-s 217 inhibited over 20% more strains of both escherichia coli and klebsiella than cephalothin and also showed some advantage in tests against salmonella and enterobacter. overall, of 208 strains of enterobacteriaceae tested, 172 were susceptible to bl-s 217 compared to 149 for cephalothin. bl-s 217 was less bound  to human serum proteins than cephalothin and gave higher peak blood levels in mice after intramuscular administration. the ld(50) of bl-s 217 in mice after subcutaneous administration was in excess of 4,000 mg/kg. when administered by the same route to mice experimentally infected with cephalothin-sensitive bacterial strains, this new cephalosporin was 20 times more effective than cephalothin in s. pyogenes and d. pneumoniae infections and 3 to 4 times more efficacious in an e. coli infection. its therapeutic efficacy was comparable to that of cephalothin in infections produced by strains of staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis.

TI  == experimental infection of the skin in the hamster simulating human impetigo. iii. interaction between staphylococci and group a streptococci.
AB  == the interaction between staphylococci and group a beta hemolytic streptococci in  mixed lesions was investigated in an experimental impetigo model. a strain of staphylococcus of phage type 71, which has been shown in vitro to produce a bacteriocin for streptococci and other gram-positive organisms, eliminates or reduces group a streptococci in mixed lesions. in contrast, staphylococcal strains of phage types 75 and 81, which do not produce a demonstrable bacteriocin in vitro, exhibit no such effect. some variation was noted in the in vivo response of two different streptococcal m types to the bactericidal effect of phage type 71 staphylococci. bacterial antagonism is more pronounced when staphylococci and streptococci are injected simultaneously into animals than when staphylococci are superimposed on preexisting streptococcal lesions. marked variations were found in the numbers of viable streptococci (colony-forming units) recovered from individual lesions containing identical mixtures of streptococci and phage type 71 staphylococci. the frequency of a demonstrable bactericidal effect was related to the number of streptococci injected. with small inocula of streptococci, the tendency towards an all-or-none effect was particularly striking. no evidence of selection of streptococcal or staphylococcal mutants which might explain this phenomenon was obtained. these observations suggest that the bactericidal effect of phage type 71 staphylococci  on other gram-positive organisms, previously demonstrated in vitro, appears to operate also in vivo.

AB  == normal human serum has been shown to kill l-phase variants in a fluid system by the action of antibody plus complement. previous studies, however, failed to demonstrate such killing in solid media. this failure probably resulted from inhibition of complement by medium components such as agar and nacl. a method was developed which circumvents the problems of the anticomplementary properties of agar media and the requirement of some l-phase variants for concentrations of salt that inhibit complement. using this method, we have demonstrated in solid media the killing by normal human serum of the l-phase variants of staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, s. faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhi. this method provides a relatively simple and graphic means for studying host humoral factors lethal for l-phase variants.

TI  == effects of intrarenal inoculation of staphylococcus aureus on mice.

AB  == human tissue cell lines from each of the three primary germinal sources, ectoderm (conjunctiva and carcinoma of the buccal mucosa), entoderm (intestine and liver), and mesoderm (heart and monocytes) were inoculated with group a streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and group d streptococci and were then observed. in addition, the effect of these bacteria on mouse fibroblasts was studied. all of the cell lines appeared to be equally susceptible to damage, but damage to the cells by s. pyogenes occurred only when living, actively multiplying bacteria were in contact with the tissue cells. streptococcal products in the form of "used" growth medium had no observable effect on the cells. cytopathogenic effects were first noticed about the time one would expect the bacteria to have reached the end of the log phase of growth. no damage to the tissue cells was noted when group a streptococci were separated from the cells by membrane filter  diffusion chambers or dialyzing membranes, but a membrane did not protect cells from deleterious effects of staphylococci or group d streptococci. group a streptococci survived in the tissue culture medium, but multiplication did not occur unless living tissue cells were present.

TI  == heterogenetic antigens of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == chorpenning, frank w. (the ohio state university, columbus), and matthew c. dodd. heterogenetic antigens of gram-positive bacteria. j. bacteriol. 91:1440-1445. 1966.-soluble antigens obtained by various methods from gram-positive bacteria were used to modify erythrocytes whose hemagglutinating reactions with immune rabbit sera and normal human sera were then studied. antigens from all gram-positive organisms studied except corynbacteria altered red cells, causing them to react with specific bacterial antisera and with normal human sera; however, cross-absorption and inhibition tests indicated that at least three different specificites were involved. one of these antigens seemed to be similar  to rantz's streptococcal nss, which is shared with staphylococcus aureus and bacillus spp., and is therefore heterogenetic. another was found in streptococci  but was apparently not present in s. aureus and bacillus spp. a third antigen, also heterogenetic, appeared to be shared by several species of bacillus and by s. aureus, but not by streptococci or any gram-negative bacteria. the third antigen was heat-stable at ph 8.0, and appeared to be essentially polysaccharide  in nature. normal human sera varied in their content of antibodies which reacted  with erythrocytes modified by extracts from gram-positive bacteria. whereas some  sera reacted very broadly with red cells modified by extracts of practically any  gram-positive organism, other sera agglutinated only cells which had been modified by streptococcal antigen.

AB  == bayliss, berenice g. (washington state university, pullman), and elizabeth r. hall. plasma coagulation by organisms other than staphylococcus aureus. j. bacteriol. 89:101-105. 1965.-approximately 200 organisms were investigated for their ability to clot human and rabbit plasma. various anticoagulants were used in preparing the plasma: acid-citrate-dextrose, ethylenediaminetetraacetate, balanced oxalate, potassium and sodium oxalates, and heparin. twelve organisms were found which coagulated citrated plasma in less than 8 hr: four strains of streptococcus faecalis; two strains of s. faecalis var. zymogenes; three strains  of s. faecalis var. liquefaciens; and one strain each of s. pyogenes, escherichia coli, and serratia marcescens. six strains of coagulase-positive staphylococcus were selected for use as controls. experiments were performed to determine the mechanism by which these microorganisms coagulated citrated plasma. as this was the only plasma clotted, it was presumed that the citrate was utilized by the microorganisms, thereby releasing the calcium which was then made available so that normal physiological clotting could occur. to test this hypothesis, a chromatographic method was employed to determine the presence or absence of citrate. coagulation tests, by use of increasing amounts of citrate, showed a linear relationship between the amount of citrate in the plasma and the coagulation time. it was demonstrated that the organisms must be actively metabolizing to clot citrated plasma. proof for this was obtained by using a cell-free filtrate, to which thimerosal had been added to inhibit growth, instead of whole cultures for the coagulation test. only the coagulase-positive staphylococci coagulated the citrated plasma under these conditions. from the results obtained, it was concluded that plasma coagulation by these organisms was by citrate utilization.

TI  == a new selective blood agar medium for streptococcus pyogenes and other haemolytic streptococci.
AB  == horse blood agar containing polymyxin b sulphate, neomycin sulphate, and fusidic  acid inhibited the growth of staph. aureus, ps. pyocyanea, proteus mirabilis, e.  coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae but allowed good growth of, and haemolysis by, str. pyogenes. in a comparison with blood agar, blood 4% agar, and gentian violet blood agar, the selective medium (p.n.f.) yielded a significantly higher proportion of streptococci than the other media, both by aerobic and by anaerobic culture, from burn swab extracts deliberately contaminated with str. pyogenes; p.n.f. culture was more effective with dilute than with heavy inocula of str. pyogenes, allowing from three to seven times as many recoveries of str. pyogenes  from swabs contaminated with 10(-3) dilution of streptococcal cultures than cultures of the same material on the other media. haemolytic streptococci of groups a, c, d, g, and others were isolated by aerobic culture from burns in a consecutive series of 1,277 swabs more often on p.n.f. medium than on blood 4% agar. viable counts of 12 strains (including 11 different serological types) of str. pyogenes showed some reduction in the numbers of colonies compared with counts on blood agar, and some strains grew more slowly on p.n.f. medium. these limitations, however, were offset and outweighed by the higher final yield of streptococci on the selective medium.

AB  == chang, te-wen (tufts university school of medicine, boston, mass.) and louis weinstein. in vitro biological activity of cephalothin. j. bacteriol. 85:1022-1027. 1963.-cephalothin is a "broad-spectrum" antibiotic active, in low concentrations, against diplococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus. shigella, salmonella, and proteus mirabilis were the most  sensitive of the gram-negative organisms. escherichia coli and aerobacter aerogenes were suppressed to a lesser degree, whereas pseudomonas aeruginosa and  herellea were highly resistant. penicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains of s. aureus were equally susceptible to cephalothin. exposure to increasing concentrations of the drug very frequently led to the development of resistance in gram-negative organisms; this was observed less often with s. aureus. cephalothin stimulated the production of penicillinase by staphylococci, which remained sensitive to the cephalosporanic acid derivatives despite repeated subculture in increasing concentrations of the agent. cephalothin was not inhibited by penicillinase. this antibiotic was more toxic to cultures of human amnion and mouse embryo cells than benzyl penicillin g but was less injurious than oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, and demethylchlortetracycline; tetracylcine produced about the same degree of cellular damage as cephalothin.

AB  == streightoff, frank (the lilly research laboratories, indianapolis, ind.). inhibition of bacteria by 5-fluoronicotinic acid and other analogues of nicotinic acid. j. bacteriol. 85:42-48. 1963.-several compounds related to 5-fluoronicotinic acid (5-fna) have been demonstrated to inhibit streptococcus sp. (viridans group), staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and lactobacillus  plantarum in vitro. the most active compounds were 5-fna and 5-fluoronicotinamide (5-fnam). the growth of streptococcus sp. was inhibited more than 50% by 0.05 mug/ml of 5-fna or 0.5 mug/ml of 5-fnam. the inhibition of streptococcus sp. from 1 part of 5-fna or 5-fnam was reversed by 4 and 2 parts of nicotinic acid, respectively. the inhibition of e. coli from 100 parts of 5-fna or 5-fnam was reversed by 1 part of nicotinic acid. inhibitions by most other active compounds  could be reversed by nicotinic acid. in experiments with mice, eight compounds related to 5-fna had activity against streptococcus pyogenes; 5-fna, 5-fnam, and  5-fluoro-n-dimethylaminomethylnicotinamide protected all mice at 83 mg/kg x two treatments subcutaneously. the action of 200 mg/kg x two treatments of 5-fna was  reversed by 20 mg/kg x two treatments of nicotinic acid. the activity of 5-fna was not increased by modifications at the number 3 or 5 positions on the pyridine ring or by any other structural changes.

TI  == the antimicrobial properties of some alpha-amino-oxy-acids, alpha-amino-oxy-hydrazides, alkoxyamines, alkoxydiguanides and their derivatives.
AB  == a series of compounds containing an amino-oxy-group has been examined for antibacterial and antifungal activity. the amino-oxy-acids and the alkoxyamines showed little activity, but the hydrazides, notably the amino-oxydodecyl and the  amino-oxytetradecyl compounds, had appreciable activity against staphylococcus aureus. the alkoxydiguanides showed considerable bactericidal activity in vitro against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms and some activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis. the most active compounds were those with a chain containing 10 to 14 carbon atoms, but the activity was considerably reduced in the presence of serum. they were also active against the few fungi tested. the most active compound, decyloxydiguanide, was moderately toxic when administered intraperitoneally to mice and no therapeutic activity could be demonstrated against an intraperitoneal injection of streptococcus pyogenes administered 15 min. previously.

TI  == studies on streptococcus pyogenes. iv. effect of whole cells, m and c antigens, and other components of the cell on adrenalectomized rats.
AB  == heat-killed cells of group a streptococci caused death of the adrenalectomized rat. while the adrenalectomized rat readily succumbed to intraperitoneal infection with living cells, death was due primarily to toxicity. the normal rat  was highly resistant under either condition. for studies on the toxic materials,  the cells of numerous serological types of group a streptococci, and of a group b and a group d streptococcus, were extracted with 0.1 n hcl at 100 degrees c. or by sonic oscillation. the extracts, containing macromolecular components, were subjected to chemical fractionation and purification. c substance and m protein of group a streptococci released from the cell by sonic oscillation were toxic to the adrenalectomized rat in quantities of 1 mg./100 gm. rat. death usually occurred within 2 hours. on the other hand, c substance and m protein released from the cell with hcl at 100 degrees c. were relatively non-toxic to the adrenalectomized rat. the sonic-extracted c substance of streptococcal groups b,  c, and d was also toxic. the toxic property of the c and m preparations was neutralized in vitro in each case by group and type-specific rabbit antiserum. heterologous antiserum was without effect. adrenalectomized rats which received homologous antiserum 18 hours before challenge were also resistant to the toxicity of the c and m preparations. trypsin destroyed the toxic effect of the m protein preparations and was without effect on the toxicity of the c substance. the r antigen and a nucleoprotein component of group a streptococci, preparations of protein from groups b and d streptococci, and coagulase from staphylococcus aureus were all found to be essentially non-toxicic for the adrenalectomized rat. large quantities of peptone, crystalline albumin, and rabbit serum were also without effect.

TI  == the international standard for bacitracin.
AB  == in 1952, the department of biological standards, national institute for medical research, london, was authorized by the who expert committee on biological standardization to proceed with the establishment of an international standard for bacitracin. thirty grams of bacitracin were obtained and it was decided to compare the proposed international standard with the existing working standard for bacitracin of the united states food and drug administration.six laboratories in five countries participated in the collaborative assay. a total of 52 assays was carried out, but the overall weighted mean potency was calculated from only the 48 biological assays, the 4 assays by the hiscox method being excluded. the biological assays were done by the plate, the cylinder, or the disc method, using streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, corynebacterium xerosis, or micrococcus flavus.after analysing the results by standard statistical methods, the authors established the batch of bacitracin examined as the international standard. the standard contains 55 international units of activity per mg, and the international unit has therefore been defined as the activity contained in 0.0182 mg of the international standard for bacitracin.

TI  == cyanide-sensitive bacterial respiratory systems different from the usual cytochrome-cytochrome oxidase system.
AB  == aerobic respiration of streptococcus pyogenes and pneumococcus type 1 are strongly inhibited by kcn, nan(3), and na(2)s. the anaerobic glycolysis of glucose by pneumococcus is also inhibited by kcn and nan(3). streptococcus pyogenes, e. coli, pneumococcus type 1, b. subtilis, b. proteus, and staphylococcus aureus did not catalyze the oxygen uptake by p-phenylenediamine in the presence of added cytochrome c or in its absence. yeast cells, b. subtilis, and b. pyocyaneus oxidized p-phenylenediamine to a dark purple meriquinoid substance in contrast to the other bacteria mentioned above. streptococcus pyogenes in contrast to pneumococcus type 1 catalyzed the oxygen uptake by cysteine. neither of these bacteria catalyzed the oxygen uptake by tyrosine, adrenaline, pyrocatechin, xanthine, and hypoxanthine. streptococcus pyogenes, pneumococcus type 1, and e. coli, boiled and not boiled, gave positive peroxidative tests with benzidine showing the presence of hematin compounds. the  results discussed in the light of the interpretations offered by keilin and harpley show that streptococcus pyogenes and pneumococcus type 1 contain cyanide-sensitive respiratory systems which are different from the cytochrome c-cytochrome oxidase system.

TI  == the influence of acute alcoholism on the normal vital resistance of rabbits to infection.
AB  == the deductions that may be drawn from the results of these experiments are as follows: that the normal vital resistance of rabbits to infection by streptococcus pyogenes (erysipelatos) is markedly diminished through the influence of alcohol when given daily to the stage of acute intoxication. that a  similar, though by no means so conspicuous, diminution of resistance to infection and intoxication by the bacillus coli communis also occurs in rabbits subjected to the same influences. and that, while in alcoholized rabbits inoculated in various ways with staphylococcus pyogenes aureus, individual instances of lowered resistance are observed, still it is impossible to say from these experiments that in general a marked difference is noticed between alcoholized and non-alcoholized animals as regards infection by this particular organism. it is interesting to note that the results of inoculation of alcoholized rabbits with the erysipelas coccus correspond in a way with clinical observations on human beings addicted to the excessive use of alcohol when infected by this organism. in the course of the work an effort was made to determine if, through the oxidation of alcohol in the tissues to acids of the corresponding chemical group, the increase of susceptibility could be referred to a diminution in the alkalinity of the blood as a result of the presence of such acids. the number of  experiments thus far made on this point is too small to justify dogmatic statements, but from what we have gathered there is but little evidence in support of this view. throughout these experiments, with few exceptions, it will  be seen that the alcoholized animals not only showed the effects of the inoculations earlier than did the non-alcoholized rabbits, but in the case of the streptococcus inoculations the lesions produced (formation of miliary abscesses)  were much more pronounced than are those that usually follow inoculation with this organism. with regard to the predisposing influence of the alcohol, one is constrained to believe that it is in most cases the result of structural alterations consequent upon its direct action on the tissues, though in a number  of the animals no such alteration could be made out by macroscopic examination. i am inclined, however, to the belief, in the light of the work of berkley and of friedenwald, done under the direction of prof. welch, in the pathological laboratory of the johns hopkina university, that a closer study of the tissues of these animals would have revealed in all of them structural changes of such a nature as to indicate disturbances of important vital functions of sufficient gravity to fully account for the loss of normal resistance. the conspicuous influence of the alcohol on the gastric mucous membrane in many of these animals, with the consequent disturbance of nutrition, is undoubtedly the explanation of the marked loss in body weight that was observed in many of the animals employed  in these experiments. in this light the susceptibility induced by alcohol to excess is somewhat analogous to that induced by starvation, where we see the resistance of animals to particular forms of infection very markedly diminished.
