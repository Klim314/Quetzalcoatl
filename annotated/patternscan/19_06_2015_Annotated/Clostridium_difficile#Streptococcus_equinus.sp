TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == how a bowel tumour led to meningitis.
AB  == this report summarises a case history in which a 75-year-old man was admitted with bacterial meningitis caused by streptococcus bovis. a subsequent abdominal investigation in the light of the known association between invasive s bovis infection and colonic cancer confirmed the suspicion of a cancer located to the rectum. the patient died from clostridium difficile enterocolitis with sepsis and multi-organ failure. this is a highly relevant and interesting case presentation, which besides providing a learning point that patients with s bovis infection should undergo investigation for abdominal cancer, describes a 'best practice' pattern in which clinicians followed up on a known association between a rare clinical presentation and underlying disease.

TI  == fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of hindgut bacteria associated with the development of equine laminitis.
AB  == carbohydrate-induced laminitis in horses is characterized by marked changes in the composition of the hindgut microbiota, from a predominantly gram-negative population to one dominated by gram-positive bacteria. the objective of this study was to monitor changes in the relative abundance of selected hindgut bacteria that have previously been implicated in the pathophysiology of equine laminitis using fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish). caecal cannulae were surgically implanted in five standardbred horses and laminitis induced by oral administration of a bolus dose of oligofructose. caecal fluid and faecal specimens were collected over a 48 h period at 2 to 4 h intervals post-oligofructose administration and subjected to fish using probes specific for nine bacterial groups to determine changes in their relative abundance compared with total bacteria hybridizing to the generic eubmix probe. additionally, hoof biopsies were taken over the course of the experiment at 6 h intervals and evaluated for histopathological changes consistent with laminitis, allowing changes in hindgut microbiota to be correlated with the onset of lesions in the foot. of the microorganisms specifically targeted, streptococci of the streptococcus bovis/equinus complex were the only bacteria that consistently proliferated in both caecal fluid and faeces immediately before the onset of histological signs of laminitis. furthermore, lactobacilli, enterobacteriaceae, allisonella histaminiformans, enterococci, bacteroides fragilis, mitsuokella jalaludinii and clostridium difficile did not establish significant populations in the hindgut before the onset of equine laminitis.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 gram-positive microorganisms. the mic(90) (mg/l) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus anginosus and actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for streptococcus sanguis and listeria monocytogenes, 2 for corynebacterium jekeium and bifidobacterium bivius. over 50% of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium,  quinolone-resistant staphylococci, nocardia steroides and clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/l moxifloxacin. moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against gram-positive bacilli.

TI  == [genotyping of isolates of bacteria and candida].
AB  == strain differentiation of staphylococcus species, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, and candida species was performed by restriction endonuclease analysis (rea) of genomic dna with hinfi or haeiii followed by conventional agarose gel electrophoresis. rea of 19 methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates and 19 methicillin-susceptible s. aureus isolates revealed 8, and 14 patterns, respectively. fifty-three isolates of s. epidermidis were divided into 39 groups on the basis of rea pattern. rea patterns obtained from different strains of the same species were more similar than those  from different staphylococcus species. a total of 67 patterns were noted among 215 s. pneumoniae isolates. there was some correlation between the rea patterns and serotypes. in addition, all 61 isolates showing the pattern 6 (serotype 19) were penicillin-resistant. sixteen isolates of e. coli o157 and 18 isolates of e. coli o25 were analyzed by rea with haeiii. among 14 epidemiologically unrelated e. coli o157:h7 isolates, rea patterns were either identical or differed only by  a few fragment bands. rea patterns of 7 isolates of heat stable enterotoxin producing e. coli o25 from an outbreak were identical. eight distinct rea patterns were noted among 7 toxigenic c. difficile strains, and one to two strains were included in each group. candida strains belonging to different six candida species were analysed by rea. all c. albicans isolates (148 strains) showed one to four bright bands ranging from 4 to 8kb in size, and these strains  were divided into 37 groups according to the rea patterns. each candida strain showed species-specific rea patterns. twenty-one isolates of mycobacterium tuberculosis complex were analyzed by pcr with primer complementary to the inverted repeat of is6110(is6110-pcr). the results of pcr of 19 m. tuberculosis isolates and 2 m. bovis bcg isolates revealed 15 patterns, and 1 pattern, respectively. our results demonstrated that rea of genomic dna with hinfi or haeiii was a useful tool for strain differentiation. by comparing the species-specific rea patterns of reference strains, clinical isolates of candida  and staphylococci could be identified to the species level if they could not be identified by routine biochemical methods. because is6110-pcr is simple and rapid to perform, it seems to be a good screening method to differentiate m. tuberculosis strains.

TI  == the intestinal microflora of infants: composition of fecal flora in breast-fed and bottle-fed infants.
AB  == the fecal flora of 35 breast-fed and 35 bottle-fed babies was determined. bifidobacteria were the predominant fecal bacteria in both groups. conversely, the counts of most of the other bacteria, such as bacteroides, eubacteria, peptococci, veillonella, clostridia, enterobacteria, streptococci, and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. the frequencies of occurrence of lecithinase positive clostridia, clostridia-others, pseudomonas and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. twenty-one genera and 103 species or biovars of microorganisms were isolated from the feces of the breast-fed group and 20 genera and 97 species or biovars from the bottle-fed group. the organism that showed the highest number and the highest frequency of occurrence in both groups was bifidobacterium breve. bifidobacterium infantis, which was formerly the most prevalent bifidobacterium species in baby feces, was  never isolated in this study. further, the counts and incidences of clostridium paraputrificum, c. perfringens, and bacillus subtilis, the counts of c. clostridiiforme, bacteroides vulgatus, veillonella parvula, lactobacillus acidophilus, escherichia coli, streptococcus bovis, s. faecalis, and s. faecium and the incidences of c. difficile, c. tertium, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the bottle-fed infants were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed infants.
