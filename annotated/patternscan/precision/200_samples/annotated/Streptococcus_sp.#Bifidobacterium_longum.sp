TI == comparison of the gut microbiota profile in breast-fed and formula-fed korean infants using pyrosequencing.
AB == background/objectives: feeding in infancy is the most significant determinant of  the intestinal microbiota in early life. the aim of this study was to determine the gut microbiota of korean infants and compare the microbiota obtained between breast-fed and formula-fed korean infants. subjects/methods: we analyzed the microbial communities in fecal samples collected from twenty 4-week old korean (ten samples in each breast-fed or formula-fed) infants using pyrosequencing. results: the fecal microbiota of the 4-week-old korean infants consisted of the three phyla actinobacteria, firmicutes, and proteobacteria. in addition, five species, including bifidocbacterium longum, streptococcus salivarius, strepotococcus lactarius, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and lactobacillus gasseri were common commensal intestinal microbiota in all infants. the predominant intestinal microbiota in the breast-fed infants (bfi) included the phylum actinobacteria (average 70.55%), family bifidobacteriacea (70.12%), genus bifidobacterium (70.03%) and species bifidobacterium longum (69.96%). in the microbiota from the formula-fed infants (ffi), the proportion of the phylum actinobacteria (40.68%) was less, whereas the proportions of firmicutes (45.38%) and proteobacteria (13.85%) as well as the diversity of each taxonomic level were greater, compared to those of the bfi. the probiotic species found in the 4-week-old korean infants were bifidobacterium longum, streptococcus salivarius, and lactobacillus gasseri. these probiotic species accounted for 93.81% of the microbiota from the bfi, while only 63.80% of the microbiota from the ffi. in particular, b. longum was more abundant in bfi (69.96%) than in ffi (34.17%). conclusions: breast milk supports the growth of b. longum and inhibits others. to the best of our knowledge, this study was the first attempt to analyze the gut microbiota of healthy korean infants according to the feeding type using pyrosequencing. our data can be used as a basis for further studies to investigate the development of intestinal microbiota with aging and disease status.

TI == establishment of a sensitive system for analysis of human vaginal microbiota on the basis of rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr.
AB == ten specific primer sets, for lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus crispatus, atopobium vaginae, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii, chlamydia trachomatis/muridarum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, and bifidobacterium angulatum, were developed for quantitative analysis of vaginal microbiota. rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) analysis of the vaginal samples from 12 healthy japanese volunteers using the new primer sets together with 25 existing primer sets revealed the diversity of their vaginal microbiota: lactobacilli such as l. crispatus, l. gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus iners, and lactobacillus vaginalis, as the major populations at 10(7) cells/ml vaginal fluid, were followed by facultative anaerobes such as streptococcus and strict anaerobes at lower population levels of 10(4) cells/ml or less. certain bacterial vaginosis (bv)-related bacteria, such as g. vaginalis, a. vaginae, m. curtisii, and prevotella, were also detected in some subjects. especially in one subject, both g. vaginalis and a. vaginae were detected at high population levels of 10(8.8) and 10(8.9) cells/ml vaginal fluid, suggesting that she is an asymptomatic bv patient. these results suggest that the rt-qpcr system is effective for accurate analysis of major vaginal commensals and diagnosis of several vaginal infections.

TI == pulp and plaque microbiotas of children with severe early childhood caries.
AB == background and objective: bacterial invasion into pulps of primary teeth can lead to infection and premature tooth loss in children. this pilot study aimed to explore whether the microbiota of carious exposures of dental pulps resembles that of carious dentin or that of infected root canals. design: children with severe early childhood caries were studied. children were consented and extent of caries, plaque, and gingivitis measured. bacteria were sampled from carious lesion biofilms and vital carious exposures of pulps, and processed by anaerobic culture. isolates were characterized from partial sequences of the 16s rrna gene and identified by comparison with taxa in the human oral microbiome database (http://www.homd.org). the microbiotas of carious lesions and dental pulps were compared using univariate and multivariate approaches. results: the microbiota of cariously exposed pulps was similar in composition to that of carious lesion biofilms except that fewer species/taxa were identified from pulps. the major taxa identified belonged to the phyla firmicutes (mainly streptococci) and actinobacteria (mainly actinomyces species). actinomyces and selenomonas species were associated with carious lesions whereas veillonella species, particularly veillonella dispar was associated with pulps. other bacteria detected in pulps included streptococcus mutans, parascardovia denticolens, bifidobacterium longum, and several lactobacillus and actinomyces species. by principal, component analysis pulp microbiotas grouped together, whereas those in caries biofilms were widely dispersed. conclusions: we conclude that the microbiota of cariously exposed vital primary pulps is composed of a subset of species associated with carious lesions. vital primary pulps had a dominant firmicutes and actinobacteria microbiota which contrasts with reports of endodontic infections which can harbor a gram-negative microbiota. the microbiota of exposed primary pulps may provide insight into bacterial species at the forefront of caries invasion in dentinal lesions that can invade into the pulp and the nature of species that need suppressing for successful pulp therapy.

TI == bacterial community structure associated with elective cesarean section versus vaginal delivery in chinese newborns.
AB == objectives: increasing attention is being paid to the potential for cesarean birth to influence the taxa of the bacteria that compose the infant intestinal microbiota. the present study characterized the diversity of the intestinal microbiota in newborn infants delivered vaginally (vd) or by cesarean section (cd). methods: a cross-sectional study was performed using fecal specimens collected on days 2 and 4 of postnatal life from 25 vd infants and 16 cd infants. profiles of the fecal microbiota were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis in combination with 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene sequencing of the clones corresponding to the degenerating gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) bands. results: on days 2 and 4 of postnatal life, vd and cd infants did not differ in the richness and evenness of the fecal bacterial community; however, the taxa of the fecal microbiota were significantly different between the 2 groups. in vd infants, escherichia coli, bacteroides sp, and bifidobacterium longum were the dominant microbes. in cd infants, staphylococcus sp, clostridium sp, enterobacter sp, and streptococcus sp were more common. conclusions: these results demonstrate that delivery method has a profound influence on the structure of the intestinal microbiota in chinese newborn infants. this is in accordance with data reported in other regions.

TI == feed supplementation with red seaweeds, chondrus crispus and sarcodiotheca gaudichaudii, affects performance, egg quality, and gut microbiota of layer hens.
AB == the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the inclusion of red seaweed  supplementation to standard poultry diets on production performance, egg quality, intestinal histology, and cecal short-chain fatty acids in lohmann brown classic laying hens. a total of 160 birds were randomly assigned to 8 treatment groups. control hens were fed a basal layer diet; positive control hens were fed a diet containing 2% inulin; and 6 treatment groups were fed a diet containing one of the following; 0.5, 1, or 2% chondrus crispus (cc0.5, cc1, and cc2, respectively) and one of the same 3 levels of sarcodiotheca gaudichaudii (sg0.5, sg1, and sg2, respectively). dietary supplementation had no significant effect on the feed intake, bw, egg production, fecal moisture content, and blood serum profile of the birds. the feed conversion ratio per gram of egg was significantly more efficient (p = 0.001) for cc2 and sg2 treatments. moreover, sg1 supplementation increased egg yolk weight (p = 0.0035) and birds with cc1 supplementation had higher egg weight (p = 0.0006). the sg2 and cc2 groups had greater (p < 0.05) villus height and villus surface area compared with the control birds. seaweed supplementation increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria [e.g., bifidobacterium longum (4- to 14-fold), streptococcus salivarius (4- to 15-fold)] and importantly reduced the prevalence of clostridium perfringens in the gut of the chicken. additionally, the concentrations of short-chain fatty acids, including acetic acid, propionic acid, n-butyric acid, and i-butyric acid, were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in cc and sg treatments than in the control. in conclusion, dietary supplementation using red seaweed inclusions can act as a potential prebiotic to improve performance, egg quality, and overall gut health in layer hens.

TI == probiotics for preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB == background: ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) is common in intensive care units (icus). some evidence indicates that probiotics may reduce the incidence of vap. several additional published studies have demonstrated that probiotics are safe and efficacious in preventing vap in icus. we aimed to systematically summarise the results of all available data to generate the best evidence for the prevention of vap. objectives: to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for preventing vap. search methods: we searched central (2014, issue 8), medline (1948 to september week 1, 2014) and embase (2010 to september 2014). selection criteria: randomised controlled trials (rcts) comparing probiotics with placebo or another control (excluding rcts that use probiotics in both study groups) to prevent vap. data collection and analysis: two review authors independently assessed eligibility and the quality of trials, and extracted data. main results: we included eight rcts, with 1083 participants. all studies compared a form of probiotic (lactobacillus casei rhamnosus; lactobacillus plantarum; synbiotic 2000forte; ergyphilus; combination bifidobacterium longum + lactobacillus bulgaricus + streptococcus thermophilus) versus a control group (placebo; glutamine; fermentable fibre; peptide; chlorhexidine). the analysis of all rcts showed that the use of probiotics decreased the incidence of vap (odds ratio (or) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.52 to 0.95, low quality evidence). however, the aggregated results were uncertain for icu mortality (or 0.84, 95% ci 0.58 to 1.22 very low quality evidence), in-hospital mortality (or 0.78, 95% ci 0.54 to 1.14, very low quality evidence), incidence of diarrhoea (or 0.72, 95% ci 0.47 to 1.09, very low quality evidence), length of icu stay (mean difference (md) -1.60, 95% ci -6.53 to 3.33, very low quality evidence), duration of mechanical ventilation (md -6.15, 95% ci -18.77 to 6.47, very low quality evidence) and antibiotic use (or 1.23, 95% ci 0.51 to 2.96, low quality evidence). antibiotics for vap were used for a shorter duration (in days) when participants received probiotics in one small study (md -3.00, 95% ci -6.04 to 0.04). however, the ci of the estimated effect was too wide to exclude no difference with probiotics. there were no reported events of nosocomial probiotic infections in any included study.the overall methodological quality of the included studies, based on our 'risk of bias' assessments, was moderate with half of the included studies rated as a 'low' risk of bias; however, we rated four included studies as a 'high' risk of bias across one or more of the domains. the study limitations, differences in probiotics administered and participants, and small sample sizes across the included studies mean that the power to detect a trend of overall effect may be limited and chance findings cannot be excluded.to explore the influence of some potential confounding factors in the studies, we conducted an intention-to-treat (itt) analysis, which did not change the inference of per-protocol analysis. however, our sensitivity analysis did not indicate a significant difference between groups for instances of vap. authors' conclusions: evidence suggests that use of probiotics is associated with a reduction in the incidence of vap. however, the quality of the evidence is low and the exclusion of the one study that did not provide a robust definition of vap increased the uncertainty in this finding. the available evidence is not clear regarding a decrease in icu or hospital mortality with probiotic use. three trials reported on the incidence of diarrhoea and the pooled results indicate no clear evidence of a difference. the results of this meta-analysis do not provide sufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the efficacy and safety of probiotics for the prevention of vap in icu patients.

TI == short-term probiotic therapy alleviates small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, but does not improve intestinal permeability in chronic liver disease.
AB == aim: : although numerous animal studies suggest that probiotic therapy has beneficial effects in various liver diseases, the evidence for beneficial effects in human liver disease is controversial. this study was carried out to investigate the efficacy of probiotic therapy in alleviating small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (sibo) and permeability in chronic liver disease. methods: fifty-three patients with chronic liver disease were randomized to either probiotic therapy or placebo. six bacterial species were used: bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and streptococcus thermophilus. after 4 weeks, changes in the composition of fecal bacteria, sibo, intestinal permeability, and clinical symptoms were examined. results: three of the six probiotic species, b. lactis, l. rhamnosus, and l. acidophilus, increased in the feces of the probiotic therapy group (p<0.001), whereas there was no change in fecal microbiota in the placebo group. sibo disappeared in many individuals of the probiotic therapy group, but none in the placebo (24 vs. 0%, p<0.05). general gastrointestinal symptoms also improved more in the probiotic group and improvement in intestinal permeability was slightly but not significantly more frequent in the probiotic arm than the placebo arm (50 vs. 31.3%, p=0.248). numbers of lactobacilli in stool were correlated negatively with intestinal permeability (p for trend<0.05). liver chemistry did not improve significantly in either group. conclusions: we conclude that short-term probiotic administration in chronic liver disease is effective in alleviating sibo and clinical symptoms, but ineffective in improving intestinal permeability and liver function.

TI == survival of bifidobacterium longum and its effect on physicochemical properties and sensorial attributes of white brined cheese.
AB == survival of the probiotic adjunct culture bifidobacterium longum and cheese starters during ripening of white brined cheese, effect of the probiotic culture on physicochemical properties and sensorial attributes of cheeses were investigated throughout 90 d of ripening. bifidobacterium longum were able to survive at higher levels (>10(7 )cfu/g cheese) than the therapeutic minimum (10(6)-10(7 )cfu/g cheese) after 90 d and did not have any negative effect on the survival of streptococcus spp. (including common cheese starters). incorporation of the probiotic adjunct into white brined cheese and high levels of their survival rates during ripening had an insignificant effect on the composition of cheeses. results indicated that white brined cheese is a suitable food matrix for the delivery of b. longum used in this study, and white brined cheeses with b. longum may be considered as a probiotic dairy product.

TI == combination of heterogeneous catalase and superoxide dismutase protects bifidobacterium longum strain ncc2705 from oxidative stress.
AB == bifidobacteria are generally sensitive to oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species (ros). to improve oxidative-stress tolerance, the superoxide dismutase (sod) gene from streptococcus thermophilus (stsoda) and the heme-dependent catalase (kat) gene from lactobacillus plantarum (lpkatl) were heterologously expressed in bifidobacterium longum strain ncc2705. three types of strain ncc2705 transformants were obtained: with transgenic sod expression, with transgenic kat expression, and with coexpression of the two genes. intracellular expression of the genes and their functional role in oxidative-stress resistance were evaluated. in response to oxidative stress, b. longum ncc2705/pdp401-lpkatl (expressing lpkatl) and ncc2705/pdp-kat-sod (coexpressing lpkatl and stsoda) rapidly degraded exogenous h2o2 and the peroxides generated as a byproduct of aerobic cultivation, preventing oxidative damage to dna and rna. individual expression of stsoda or lpkatl both improved b. longum ncc2705 cell viability. survival rate of strain ncc2705 was further improved by combining sod and kat expression. the two enzymes played complementary roles in ros-scavenging pathways, and coexpression led to a synergistic beneficial effect under conditions of intensified oxidative stress. our results illustrate that heterogeneous expression of heme-dependent kat and mn(2+)-dependent sod is functional in the b. longum oxidative-stress response, and synergistic protection is achieved when their expressions are combined.

TI == antiradical and tea polyphenol-stabilizing ability of functional fermented soymilk-tea beverage.
AB == this study examined the potential of two-step fermentation to preserve tps in functional soy-tea beverage. fermented soymilk-tea (fst) was produced by culturing streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and bifidobacterium longum in soymilk supplemented with tea extract (te). total phenolic content (tpc) and anti-radical activities were determined for fsts and fermented soymilk (fs). a hplc method was employed to quantify nine major tea phenolics in fst products. tpc was significantly higher (p<0.05) in fst than fs, in the order of green tea>oolong tea>black tea>soymilk. the fsts were effective at scavenging dpph-radical rather than hydroxyl radical. optimal ph to stabilize tps in smt was ca. 5.7, which reduced total tp loss by ca. 40% compared with that obtained from products with te supplemented at the beginning of fermentation. a gradual decrease in tps was observed during storage (4 degrees c), with more than half of total tps remained in fst after 8 weeks.

TI == utilization of major fucosylated and sialylated human milk oligosaccharides by isolated human gut microbes.
AB == human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) are not digested in the proximal intestine. in distal intestine, hmos collectively modify the microbiota, but the response of individual bacteria to individual components of the hmos is not well defined. here, each of 25 major isolates of the human intestinal microbiota was fed individual major fucosylated and sialylated hmos in anaerobic culture. this allowed for an assessment of the influence of specific hmos on the growth and metabolic products of individual microbiota bacteria. most bifidobacteria spp. and bacteroides spp. grew, induced alpha-l-fucosidase activity, and produced abundant lactate or short-chain fatty acids (scfas) when fed 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-fl), 3-fl, and lactodifucotetraose (ldft). lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc7830, enterococcus faecalis atcc19433, and streptococcus thermophilus atcc19258 exhibited slight growth, ph reduction, and lactate production when supplemented with 2'-fl or 3-fl, but not ldft. supplementation with 3'-sialyllactose (3'-sl) and 6'-sl promoted moderate growth of bifidobacterium longum jcm7007, 7009, 7010, 7011, 1272, 11347, atcc15708, bacteroides vulgatus atcc8482, and b. thetaiotaomicron atcc29148; accordingly, these bacteria exhibited greater neuraminidase activity and produced copious lactate, scfa, or both. lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc7830 also consumed 6'-sl. in contrast, clostridium spp., l. rhamnosus atcc53103, e. faecalis atcc29200, staphylococcus spp., enterobacter spp., and escherichia coli k12 did not consume milk oligosaccharides nor produce appreciable acidic fermentation products. specific bifidobacteria and bacteroides differentially digest specific individual hmos, with the major fucosylated milk oligosaccharides most strongly stimulating key species of mutualist symbionts. this suggests strategies for treating dysbiosis of the microbiota and associated inflammatory disorders.

TI == probiotic use and prevalence of candidemia and candiduria in a picu.
AB == objectives: to compare the prevalence of candidemia and candiduria before and after the introduction of routine use of probiotics in children who received broad-spectrum antibiotics in a picu. design: retrospective "before and after" study. setting: a 12-bed picu of a teaching hospital in india. patients: children 3 months to 12 years old, admitted to the picu over two 9 months' time periods, who received broad-spectrum antibiotics for more than 48 hours. interventions: three hundred forty-four patients enrolled between november 2008 and july 2009 after the introduction of routine use of probiotics served as the "probiotic group"; they had received one sachet twice a day of a probiotic mix (eugi [wallace pharma, goa, india] containing lactobacillus acidophillus, lactobacillus rhamnosum, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium bifidum, saccharomyces boulardii, and streptococcus thermophilus) for 7 days. three hundred seventy-six children enrolled between february 2007 and october 2007 served as "controls." blood was sent for bacterial and fungal cultures if clinically indicated and urine catheter/bag specimen was submitted for bacterial and fungal culture twice a week as per unit's protocol. measurements and main results: primary outcome was growth of candida in blood (candidemia), and secondary outcomes were growth of candida in urine (candiduria), nosocomial bloodstream infections, and urinary tract infections. data were retrieved from the case records. candidemia was seen in four of 344 patients (1.2%) in the probiotic group and in 14 of 376 (3.7%) in the control group (relative risk, 0.31; 95% ci, 0.10-0.94; p = 0.03). candiduria was noted in 37 of 344 patients (10.7%) in the probiotic group and 83 of 376 (22%) in the control group (relative risk, 0.48; 95% ci, 0.34-0.7; p = 0.0001). the prevalence of nosocomial bloodstream infection and urinary tract infection in the probiotic and control groups was 20.3% and 26% (p = 0.07) and 14.2% and 19.1% (p = 0.08), respectively. conclusions: routine use of a mix of probiotics in patients who receive broad-spectrum antibiotics could be a useful strategy to reduce the prevalence of candidemia and candiduria in the picu.

TI == efficacy and safety of probiotics in the treatment of candida-associated stomatitis.
AB == this study aimed at evaluating the short-term efficacy and safety of probiotics as an aid in the treatment of candida-associated stomatitis in a randomised controlled trial. a total of 65 patients were randomly assigned to receive oral local antifungal agents alone (gargle 2% sodium bicarbonate solution for 30 s, wait 10 min and then apply 2% nystatin paste) or these agents plus local probiotics (the mixture of bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus) three times per day for 4 weeks. parameters related to hyperaemia, visual analogue scale scores, culture of resting saliva and a lingual dorsum swab and adverse reactions were assessed or recorded in the beginning, middle and end of treatment. although the baseline characteristics of the participants were similar, both groups showed a significant reduction in pain level and hyperaemia on the tongue mucosa (p = 0.000) after 4-week application. however, despite the reduction in hyperaemia in the probiotic group, these improvements did not display statistically significant differences. the detection rate of candida spp. was 100% before treatment and 8.21% in the experimental group and 34.6% in the control group after treatment. the detection rate of candida spp. decreased (p = 0.000) in both groups and was significantly lower in the probiotic group than the control group (p = 0.038). other analysed micro-organisms, including the decreased detection rate for lactobacillus spp. (p = 0.049) and the increased detection rate for staphylococcus epidermidis (p = 0.019), did not display consistent change trends in the probiotics group. compared with conventional antifungal therapies for oral candidiasis, the inclusion of locally administered probiotics helped improve certain clinical conditions and reduced the prevalence of candida spp., although the impact of probiotics on oral bacterial species remains to be further studied.

TI == probiotics improve survival of septic rats by suppressing conditioned pathogens in ascites.
AB == aim: to investigate the benefits of probiotics treatment in septic rats. methods: the septic rats were induced by cecal ligation and puncture. the animals of control, septic model and probiotics treated groups were treated with vehicle and mixed probiotics, respectively. the mixture of probiotics included bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus. we observed the survival of septic rats using different amounts of mixed probiotics. we also detected the bacterial population in ascites and blood of experimental sepsis using cultivation and real-time polymerase chain reaction. the severity of mucosal inflammation in colonic tissues was determined. results: probiotics treatment improved survival of the rats significantly and this effect was dose dependent. the survival rate was 30% for vehicle-treated septic model group. however, 1 and 1/4 doses of probiotics treatment increased survival rate significantly compared with septic model group (80% and 55% vs 30%, p < 0.05). the total viable counts of bacteria in ascites decreased significantly in probiotics treated group compared with septic model group (5.20 +/- 0.57 vs 9.81 +/- 0.67, p < 0.05). the total positive rate of hemoculture decreased significantly in probiotics treated group compared with septic model group (33.3% vs 100.0%, p < 0.05). the population of escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus in ascites of probiotics treated group were decreased significantly compared with that of septic model group (3.93 +/- 0.73 vs 8.80 +/- 0.83, p < 0.05; 2.80 +/- 1.04 vs 5.39 +/- 1.21, p < 0.05). with probiotics treatment, there was a decrease in the scores of inflammatory cell infiltration into the intestinal mucosa in septic animals (1.50 +/- 0.25 vs 2.88 +/- 0.14, p < 0.01). conclusion: escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus may be primary pathogens in septic rats. probiotics improve survival of septic rats by suppressing these conditioned pathogens.

TI == rapid assay to assess colonization patterns following in-vivo probiotic ingestion.
AB == background: colonization of the intestine with some microorganisms has been shown to have beneficial health effects. the association of bacteria with its human host starts soon after birth; however in infants born prematurely establishment of normal intestinal flora is interrupted with colonization with potential pathogenic organisms probiotic supplementation may therefore be beneficial to the health of preterm infants. as most probiotic organisms are difficult to culture, confirmation of their colonization after supplementation is difficult. in this study, rapid qpcr assays for detection of presence of probiotic species in the intestine by faecal sampling is described in both preterm infant and adult participants. findings: probiotic colonization was determined using qpcr directed at amplification of organisms present in the ingested probiotic streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis and b. longum subsp. infantis. overall, differential detection of probiotic strains in faeces were found between adult and preterm infants, with 50% of infants continuing to shed at least two probiotic strains three weeks after probiotic ingestion had ceased. conclusions: this study demonstrated rapid assessment of the preterm infant gut for colonization with probiotic strains using real-time pcr. this method would be of great importance in studies of probiotics in prevention of diseases and adverse clinical outcomes.

TI == effect of probiotic species on irritable bowel syndrome symptoms: a bring up to date meta-analysis.
AB == background and objectives: immune system alteration in irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) patients may be modulated by probiotics. we assessed the efficacy of some probiotic species in alleviating characteristic ibs symptoms. material and methods: a meta-analysis of all identified randomized controlled trials comparing probiotics with placebo in treating ibs symptoms was performed with continuous data summarized using standardized mean differences (smds) with 95% confidence intervals (95% cis), where appropriate. the random-effects model was employed in cases of heterogeneity; otherwise, fixed-effects models were used. results: meta-analysis was performed with 10 of 24 studies identified as suitable for inclusion. probiotics improved pain scores if they contained bifidobacterium breve (smd, - 0.34; 95% ci, - 0.66; -0.02), bifidobacterium longum (smd, -0.48; 95% ci, - 0.91; -0.06), or lactobacillus acidophilus (smd, -0.31; 95% ci, -0.61; -0.01) species. distension scores were improved by probiotics containing b. breve (smd, -0.45; 95% ci, -0.77; -0.13), bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus casei, or lactobacillus plantarum (smd, -0.53; 95% ci, -1.00; -0.06) species. all probiotic species tested improved flatulence: b. breve (smd, -0.42; 95% ci, -0.75;- 0.10), b. infantis, l. casei, l. plantarum (smd, -0.60; 95% ci, -1.07; -0.13), b. longum, l. acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (smd, -0.61; 95% ci, -1.01; -0.21). there was not a clear positive effect of probiotics concerning the quality of life. conclusions: some probiotics are an effective therapeutic option for ibs patients, and the effects on each ibs symptom are likely species-specific. future studies must focus on the role of probiotics in modulating intestinal microbiota and the immune system while considering individual patient symptom profiles.

TI == effects of probiotics and antibiotics on the intestinal homeostasis in a computer controlled model of the large intestine.
AB == background: antibiotic associated diarrhea and clostridium difficile infection are frequent complications of broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. probiotic bacteria are used as therapeutic and preventive agents in these disorders, but the exact functional mechanisms and the mode of action are poorly understood. the effects of clindamycin and the probiotic mixture vsl#3 (containing the 8 bacterial strains streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) consecutively or in combination were investigated and compared to controls without therapy using a standardized human fecal microbiota in a computer-controlled in vitro model of large intestine. microbial metabolites (short chain fatty acids, lactate, branched chain fatty acids, and ammonia) and the intestinal microbiota were analyzed. results: compared to controls and combination therapy, short chain fatty acids and lactate, but also ammonia and branched chain fatty acids, were increased under probiotic therapy. the metabolic pattern under combined therapy with antibiotics and probiotics had the most beneficial and consistent effect on intestinal metabolic profiles. the intestinal microbiota showed a decrease in several indigenous bacterial groups under antibiotic therapy, there was no significant recovery of these groups when the antibiotic therapy was followed by administration of probiotics. simultaneous application of anti- and probiotics had a stabilizing effect on the intestinal microbiota with increased bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. conclusions: administration of vsl#3 parallel with the clindamycin therapy had a beneficial and stabilizing effect on the intestinal metabolic homeostasis by decreasing toxic metabolites and protecting the endogenic microbiota from destruction. probiotics could be a reasonable strategy in prevention of antibiotic associated disturbances of the intestinal homeostasis and disorders.

TI == the effect of a multispecies probiotic mixture on the symptoms and fecal microbiota in diarrhea-dominant irritable bowel syndrome: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB == background: the clinical effect of probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is still controversial. aims: we aimed to evaluate the effects of a probiotic mixture on ibs symptoms and the composition of fecal microbiota in patients with diarrhea-dominant ibs (d-ibs). methods: fifty patients with d-ibs were randomized into placebo or probiotic mixture (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, and streptococcus thermophilus 1.0x10 cfu) groups. treatment was taken daily for 8 weeks. the primary outcome was adequate relief (ar) of overall ibs symptoms, which was assessed weekly for 10 weeks. a responder was defined as a patient who experienced ar for at least half of the 10-week study period. secondary outcomes included the effects on individual symptoms, stool parameters, and ibs quality of life. the fecal flora compositions were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). results: the proportion of ar was consistently higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group throughout the 10-week period (p<0.05). the proportion of responders was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group (48% vs. 12%, p=0.01). stool consistency improved significantly in the probiotics group compared with the placebo group. percent changes in individual symptom scores were similar in the 2 groups, but ibs quality of life improvement tended to be higher in the probiotics group. comparison of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles of fecal flora showed that the concordance rate between bacterial compositions before and after treatment was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group (69.5% vs. 56.5%, p=0.005). conclusions: the probiotic mixture was effective in providing ar of overall ibs symptoms and improvement of stool consistency in d-ibs patients, although it had no significant effect on individual symptoms. the therapeutic effect of probiotics is associated with the stabilization of intestinal microbiota.

AB == oral bifidobacteriaceae, bifidobacterium dentium and bifidobacterium longum, are  known to be isolated together with mutans streptococci and lactobacilli from caries lesions, suggesting that these bifidobacteriaceae are caries associated and acid resistant. this study aimed to investigate effects of acidification on b. dentium and b. longum, and to compare them with those on streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus paracasei. effects of acidification, growth ability in a complex medium at a ph of 4.0-8.0, cell viability in 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid monohydrate (mes)-koh buffer at ph 4.0, as well as stability of intracellular ph (ph(in)) at an extracellular ph of 3.5-8.0 estimated using a fluorescent dye, 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate n-succinimidyl ester in mes-koh, 3-(n-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid-koh or n,n-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine-koh buffer, were investigated. b. longum grew as well as streptococcus strains over a wide ph range, whereas b. dentium grew best in the narrow ph range around neutral. the cell viability of b. dentium decreased significantly after 2 h of acidification at a ph of 4.0, but this was significantly less than that of the streptococcus and lactobacillus species, whereas b. longum maintained almost 100% viability. the ph(in) was close to the extracellular ph at ph of 5.5-7.5 in the bifidobacterium and streptococcus strains, while at a ph of <5.0, the ph(in) was higher than the extracellular ph in all the strains, but the ph(in) maintenance ability of bifidobacterium strains was higher than that of the streptococcus strains. the high survival rate and ph(in) maintenance ability of bifidobacteria comparable to that of s. mutans in the acidic environment may account for why bifidobacteria exist as stable species in acidic caries lesions together with mutans streptococci.

TI == consumption of human milk oligosaccharides by gut-related microbes.
AB == human milk contains large amounts of complex oligosaccharides that putatively modulate the intestinal microbiota of breast-fed infants by acting as decoy binding sites for pathogens and as prebiotics for enrichment of beneficial bacteria. several bifidobacterial species have been shown to grow well on human milk oligosaccharides. however, few data exist on other bacterial species. this work examined 16 bacterial strains belonging to 10 different genera for growth on human milk oligosaccharides. for this propose, a chemically defined medium, zmb1, was used, which allows vigorous growth of a number of gut-related microorganisms in a fashion similar to complex media. interestingly, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, bacteroides fragilis , and bacteroides vulgatus strains were able to metabolize milk oligosaccharides with high efficiency, whereas enterococcus , streptococcus , veillonella , eubacterium , clostridium , and escherichia coli strains grew less well or not at all. mass spectrometry-based glycoprofiling of the oligosaccharide consumption behavior revealed a specific preference for fucosylated oligosaccharides by bi. longum subsp. infantis and ba. vulgatus. this work expands the current knowledge of human milk oligosaccharide consumption by gut microbes, revealing bacteroides as avid consumers of this substrate. these results provide insight on how human milk oligosaccharides shape the infant intestinal microbiota.

AB == this work reports on the physicochemical characterization of 21 exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, as well as the growth and metabolic activity of the eps-producing strains in milk. the strains belong to the species lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus vaginalis, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. the molar mass distribution of eps fractions showed 2 peaks of different sizes, which is a feature shared with some eps from bacteria of food origin. in general, we detected an association between the eps size distribution and the eps-producing species, although because of the low numbers of human bacterial eps tested, we could not conclusively establish a correlation. the main monosaccharide components of the eps under study were glucose, galactose, and rhamnose, which are the same as those found in food polymers; however, the rhamnose and glucose ratios was generally higher than the galactose ratio in our human bacterial eps. all eps-producing strains were able to grow and acidify milk; most lactobacilli produced lactic acid as the main metabolite. the lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio in bifidobacteria was 0.7, close to the theoretical ratio, indicating that the eps-producing strains did not produce an excessive amount of acetic acid, which could adversely affect the sensory properties of fermented milks. with respect to their viscosity-intensifying ability, l. plantarum h2 and l. rhamnosus e41 and e43r were able to increase the viscosity of stirred, fermented milks to a similar extent as the eps-producing streptococcus thermophilus strain used as a positive control. therefore, these human eps-producing bacteria could be used as adjuncts in mixed cultures for the formulation of functional foods if probiotic characteristics could be demonstrated. this is the first article reporting the physicochemical characteristics of eps isolated from human intestinal microbiota.

AB == background: probiotics may protect against inflammatory bowel disease through regulation of lamina propria lymphocytes (lpls) function. data are lacking on possible involvement of intraepithelial lymphocytes (iels). the aim of this study was to investigate whether different probiotic mixtures prevented gut inflammatory disease and the role of both iels and lpls. methods: balb/c mice received 2 probiotic mixtures orally for 3 weeks, as mix1 (lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium longum), or mix2 (lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus thermophilus, and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis). colitis was induced by intrarectal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (tnbs). probiotics in stools were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). colon subpopulations of iels and lpls were assayed by flow cytometry. serum cytokines were measured by cytometric bead array (cba). results: all probiotics colonized the intestine. the 2 mixtures prevented the tnbs-induced intestinal damage, and mix1 was the most effective. the mix1 protection was associated with a reduction in cd4(+) cells of iels and lpls, an increase in gammadeltat cells of iels, and a decrease in gammadeltat cells of lpls. an expansion of t regulatory (treg) cells of iels was induced by mix1 and mix2. both probiotic mixtures inhibited tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha and monocyte chemotactic protein (mcp)-1 production and upregulated interleukin (il)-10. in addition, mix1 prevented the tnbs-induced increase of il-12 and interferon (ifn)-gamma. conclusions: the 2 probiotic mixtures were able to prevent the tnbs-induced colitis; the l. acidophilus and b. longum mixture was the most effective. other than an involvement of lpls, our results report a novel importance of the iels population in probiotic protection.

TI == identification of a pneumococcal glycosidase that modifies o-linked glycans.
AB == colonization of the airway by streptococcus pneumoniae is typically asymptomatic; however, progression of bacteria beyond the oronasopharynx can cause diseases including otitis media and pneumonia. the mechanisms by which s. pneumoniae establishes and maintains colonization remain poorly understood. both n-linked and o-linked glycans are abundant in the airway. our previous research demonstrated that s. pneumoniae can sequentially deglycosylate n-linked glycans and suggested that this modification of sugar structures may aid in colonization. there is published evidence that s. pneumoniae expresses a secreted o-glycosidase that cleaves galactose beta1-3 n-acetylgalactosamine (galbeta1-3galnac) from core-1 o-linked glycans; however, the biological function of this enzyme has not previously been determined. we established that the activity is not secreted but is instead surface associated in a sortase-dependent manner. genome analysis revealed an open reading frame predicted to encode a sortase-dependent surface protein with sequence similarity to the o-glycosidase of bifidobacterium longum. deletion of this pneumococcal open reading frame confirmed that this gene encodes an o-glycosidase. experiments using a model glycoconjugate demonstrated that this o-glycosidase, together with the neuraminidase nana, is required for s. pneumoniae to cleave sialylated core-1 o-linked glycans. the ability of the o-glycosidase mutant to cleave this glycan structure was restored by both genetic complementation and the addition of o-glycosidase. the mutant showed a reduction in adherence to human airway epithelial cells and a significantly decreased ability to colonize the upper respiratory tract, suggesting that cleavage of core-1 o-linked glycans enhances the ability of s. pneumoniae to colonize the human airway.

AB == probiotics are "live microbes which when administered in adequate amounts confer  a health benefit to the host" (fao/who joint group). their potential role in bio-ecological modification of pathological internal milieu of the critically ill is under evaluation. probiotics are available as single microbial strain (e.g., bacillus clausii, lactobacillus) or as a mix of multiple strains of lactobacillus (acidophilus, sporogenes, lactis, reuteri rc-14, gg, and l. plantarum 299v), bifidobacterium (bifidum, longum, infantis), streptococcus (thermophillus, lactis, fecalis), saccharomyces boulardii etc. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are gram-positive, anaerobic, lactic acid bacteria. these are normal inhabitant of human gut and colonize the colon better than others. critical illness and its treatment create hostile environment in the gut and alters the micro flora favoring growth of pathogens. therapy with probiotics is an effort to reduce or eliminate potential pathogens and toxins, to release nutrients, antioxidants, growth factors and coagulation factors, to stimulate gut motility and to modulate innate and adaptive immune defense mechanisms via the normalization of altered gut flora. scientific evidence shows that use of probiotics is effective in prevention and therapy of antibiotic associated diarrhea. however, available probiotics strains in currently used doses do not provide much needed early benefits, and need long-term administration to have clinically beneficial effects (viz, a reduction in rate of infection, severe sepsis, icu stay, ventilation days and mortality) in critically ill surgical and trauma patients. possibly, available strains do not adhere to intestinal mucosa early, or may require higher dose than what is used. gap exists in our knowledge regarding mechanisms of action of different probiotics, most effective strains--single or multiple, cost effectiveness, risk-benefit potential, optimum dose, frequency and duration of treatment etc. more information is needed on safety profile of probiotics in immunocompromised state of the critically ill in view of rare reports of fungemia and sepsis and a trend toward possible increase in nosocomial infection. at present, despite theoretical potential benefits, available evidence is not conclusive to recommend probiotics for routine use in the critically ill.

TI == clinical trial: effect of active lactic acid bacteria on mucosal barrier function in patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.
AB == background: the intestinal permeability is increased in patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (d-ibs). aim: to determine the possible efficacy of lactic acid bacteria on the increased intestinal permeability in d-ibs. methods: treatment was employed for 4 weeks in a randomized single blind placebo controlled study with 30 d-ibs patients. patients were given either probiotic fermented milk (streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium longum) or milk beverage containing no bacteria. the clinical symptoms were scored and intestinal permeability was measured by a triple sugar test before and after treatment. results: small bowel permeability was measured as the ratio of lactulose and mannitol recovery and colonic permeability was measured as the total mass of sucralose excretion (mg). after probiotics treatment, small bowel permeability decreased significantly from 0.038 (0.024) at baseline to 0.023 (0.020) (p = 0.004), the proportion of patients with increased small bowel permeability was lower than baseline (28.6% vs. 64.3%, p = 0.023). however, colonic permeability improved neither in the probiotics group nor in the placebo group at week 4. treatment with probiotics significantly decreased the mean global ibs scores compared with the baseline scores (9.62 +/- 1.05 vs. 7.64 +/- 1.24, p < 0.001). conclusion: short-term active lactic acid bacteria treatment for d-ibs improved mucosal barrier function.

TI == the effects of probiotics on ppi-triple therapy for helicobacter pylori eradication.
AB == background: this study was performed to evaluate whether the addition of probiotics to proton pump inhibitor (ppi)-based triple therapy increases the likelihood of successful helicobacter pylori eradication. materials and methods: three hundred and forty-seven h. pylori-infected patients were randomized into a triple-plus-yogurt group (yogurt group, n = 168) or a triple-only group (control group, n = 179). triple therapy consisted of ppi b.i.d., clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d., and amoxicillin 1 g b.i.d. for 7 days. yogurt group received triple therapy for 1 week and one bottle of will yogurt per day for at 3 weeks, starting on the first day of triple therapy. will yogurt (a korean brand) contains lactobacillus acidophilus hy2177, lactobacillus casei hy2743, bifidobacterium longum hy8001, and streptococcus thermophilus b-1. (13)c-urea breath test was performed at least 4 weeks after completion of triple therapy. eradication rates, compliances, and adverse events were compared. results: by intention-to treat analysis the h. pylori eradication rates in the yogurt group 79.2% (133 of 168) was similar to that in the control group 72.1% (129 of 179) (p = .124). however, by per-protocol (pp) analysis, the eradication rate in the yogurt group, 87.5% (133 of 152) was higher than that in the control group, 78.7% (129 of 164) (p = .037). common adverse events were metallic taste (11.8%) and diarrhea (8.6%). the frequency of adverse effects in the yogurt group 41.1% (69/168) were higher than in the control group, 26.3% (47 of 179) (p = .003). however, most adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity, and the severities of adverse effects were similar in both groups (p = .401). conclusions: the addition of will yogurt to triple therapy did not reduce the side-effects of triple therapy. but it increased the h. pylori eradication rate by pp analysis, encouraging more research in this field.

TI == bifidobacterium longum-fermented broccoli supernatant inhibited the growth of candida albicans and some pathogenic bacteria in vitro.
AB == the aim of this study is to develop a growth inhibitory material against some pathogenic microorganisms, using beneficial bacteria such as bifidobacterium species and certain types of vegetables which can be good substrates for the growth of the beneficial bacteria. at first, various vegetable juices were screened for the growth promotion of bifidobacterium longum etc. among the vegetables tested, broccoli (brassica oleracea l. var. botrytis l.) and cabbage (brassica oleracea l. var. capitata l.) showed excellent growth promoting activities for b. longum. secondly, the b. longum-fermented broccoli (bfb) and lactobacillus pentosus-fermented broccoli (lfb) supernatants were prepared and the growth inhibitory activities against candida albicans were determined. both of them showed dose-dependent, growth inhibitory effects, and the effect of bfb was superior to lfb. it was thought that the superior effect of bfb could be mainly attributed to the acids, especially acetic acid, produced by b. longum. bfb also inhibited some pathogenic bacteria such as streptococcus mutans and porphylomonas gingivalis. in conclusion, broccoli was found to be a good growth-promoting substance for b. longum. the fermented product, bfb, appears to be a usable material that inhibits the growth of c. albicans and some pathogenic bacteria.

TI == therapeutic potential of two probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease as observed in the trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid model of colitis.
AB == purpose: the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease is thought to be a multifactorial process. one of the leading hypotheses is that an imbalance in normal gut flora induces an excessive immune response and contributes to inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. administration of probiotic bacteria reduces symptoms in patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases, probably via both manipulation of the microflora and stimulation of the intestinal immune system. in the current study the therapeutic potential of two different probiotics-lactobacillus gg and a mixture of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium longum (yo-mix y 109 fro 1000)--in a rat model of colitis were evaluated. methods: male wistar rats were administered probiotics for three days simultaneously with colitis induction. colonic damage was evaluated histologically and biochemically and colonic tissues, as well as fecal samples, were used for bacterial studies using 16s rrna gene primers. results: probiotics administration reduced the relative amounts of the pathogenic bacteria aeromonas and escherichia coli in the colonic tissue. however, whereas both probiotics affected colon morphology, only lactobacillus gg administration reduced myeloperoxidase activity. conclusions: we report the therapeutic rather than preventive potential of two different probiotics in an animal model of colitis.

AB == this study was conducted to examine the growth, proteolytic profiles as well as angiotensin-i converting enzyme (ace) and alpha-glucosidase (alpha-glu) inhibitory potentials of selected strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab). two strains each of yogurt bacteria (streptococcus thermophilus-1275 and 285, and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus-1092 and 1368), and probiotics (l. acidophilus-4461 and 33200, and l. casei-2607 and 15286, and 1 strain of bifidobacterium longum 5022), were cultivated in reconstituted skim milk (rsm) at 37 degrees c and their proteolytic profiles and ace as well as alpha-glu inhibitory activities were determined. among all the strains of lactic acid bacteria studied, yogurt bacteria grew very well, with the exception of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 1368 which showed a slower growth during the initial 3 h of incubation. the growth pattern corresponded well with the decrease in ph for the organisms. all the organisms showed an increase in proteolysis with time. the variations in proteolytic capabilities translated into corresponding variations in ace inhibitory potential of these organisms. bifidobacterium longum 5022 showed the highest ace inhibitory potential followed by l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 1368, l. casei 15286, s. thermophilus 1275, and l. acidophilus 4461. organisms with high intracellular enzymatic activities grew well. also, aminopeptidases of strains of l. acidophilus 4461 and s. thermophilus 1275 that could better utilize proline containing substrates showed enhanced ace inhibitory potential. lactic acid bacteria possessed the ability to inhibit alpha-glu activity, which endowed them an antidiabetic property as well.

TI == effects of yogurt and bifidobacteria supplementation on the colonic microbiota in lactose-intolerant subjects.
AB == aims: colonic metabolism of lactose may play a role in lactose intolerance. we investigated whether a 2-week supplementation of bifidobacterium longum (in capsules) and a yogurt enriched with bifidobacterium animalis could modify the composition and metabolic activities of the colonic microbiota in 11 chinese lactose-intolerant subjects. methods and results: the numbers of total cells, total bacteria and the eubacterium rectale/clostridium coccoides group in faeces as measured with fluorescent in situ hybridization and the faecal beta-galactosidase activity increased significantly during supplementation. the number of bifidobacterium showed a tendency to increase during and after supplementation. with pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, in subjects in which b. animalis and b. longum were not detected before supplementation, both strains were present in faeces during supplementation, but disappeared after supplementation. the degree of lactose digestion in the small intestine and the oro-caecal transit time were not different before and after supplementation, whereas symptom scores after lactose challenge decreased after supplementation. conclusions: the results suggest that supplementation modifies the amount and metabolic activities of the colonic microbiota and alleviates symptoms in lactose-intolerant subjects. the changes in the colonic microbiota might be among the factors modified by the supplementation which lead to the alleviation of lactose intolerance. significance and impact of the study: this study provides evidence for the possibility of managing lactose intolerance with dietary lactose (yogurt) and probiotics via modulating the colonic microbiota.

AB == a comparison between 17 strains of lactic acid bacteria and 15 strains of bifidobacteria indicated that bifidobacteria induced significantly lower levels of interleukin-12 (il-12) in murine splenic cells. the present study aims to evaluate the effect and mechanism of bifidobacterium longum bb536, a probiotic strain, in suppressing antigen-induced th2 immune response in vitro. bb536 suppressed immunoglobulin (ig) e and il-4 production by ovalbumin-sensitized splenic cells, but induction of th1-inducing cytokine production, such as il-12 and gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) tended to be lower compared with lactic acid bacteria. neutralization with antibodies to il-12, ifn-gamma, il-10 and transforming growth factor beta indicated negative involvement of th1-inducing cytokines and regulatory cytokines in the suppression of th2 immune response by bb536, especially when treated at higher doses of bb536 (>10 microg cells/ml). furthermore, bb536 induced the maturation of immature bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (bm-dcs), and suppressed antigen-induced il-4 production mediated by bm-dcs. these results suggested that bb536 suppressed th2 immune responses, partially independent of th1-inducing cytokines and independent of regulatory cytokines, mediated by antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells.

AB == the objective of this study was to assess the antiallergic effect of fermented milk prepared, respectively, with streptococcus thermophilus mc, lactobacillus acidophilus b, lactobacillus bulgaricus lb, l. bulgaricus 448, and bifidobacterium longum b6. female balb/c mice fed fermented milk were immunized intraperitoneally with ovalbumin (ova)/complete freund's adjuvant (cfa) to evaluate the immune response by observing the secretion of cytokines il-2, il-4, and ifn-gamma and serum antibody ige. the results showed that supplementation with lactic acid bacteria fermented milk did not significantly change the il-2 spontaneous and ova-stimulated secretions of splenocytes. however, both spontaneous and ova-stimulated secretions of splenocytes from mice fed lactic acid bacteria fermented milk showed significantly (p < 0.05) lower levels of il-4 (th2 cytokine) than those from ova/cfa-immunized mice fed non-fermented milk (ova/cfa-milk group). the spontaneous secretion of ifn-gamma (th1 cytokine) by splenocytes from mice fed l. bulgaricus 448 or l. bulgaricus lb fermented milk significantly increased as compared to that from the ova/cfa-milk group. the results showed that the ratios of ifn-gamma to il-4 of both spontaneous and ova-stimulated secretions in splenocytes from mice fed lactic acid bacteria fermented milk increased significantly as compared to that of pbs- or ova/cfa-milk groups. the serum levels of ova-specific ige in fermented milk fed groups, especially the group fed s. thermophilus mc fermented milk, were significantly lower than those in the ova/cfa-milk group through a 6 week feeding experiment. the results showed that milk fermented with lactic acid bacteria demonstrated in vivo antiallergic effects on ova/cfa-immunized mice via increasing the secretion ratio of ifn-gamma/il-4 (th1/th2) by splenocytes and decreasing the serum level of ova-specific ige.

AB == to develop a probiotic dietary adjunct, soymilk fermented with various combinations of lactic acid bacteria (streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus acidophilus) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium infantis) was subjected to freeze-drying and spray-drying. survival of the starter organisms during the drying process, subsequent rehydration at different temperatures and during a 4-month period of storage under different storage conditions was examined. after freeze-drying, lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria exhibited a survival percent of 46.2-75.1% and 43.2-51.9%, respectively, higher than that noted after spray-drying. regardless of the drying condition, s. thermophilus showed a higher percentage of survival than l. acidophilus, while b. longum survived better than b. infantis. further study with soymilk fermented with s. thermophilus and b. longum revealed that the freeze-dried and spray-dried fermented soymilk rehydrated at 35-50 degrees c and 20 degrees c, respectively, was optimum for the recovery of the starter organisms. both s. thermophilus and b. longum survived better in the freeze-dried than the spray-dried fermented soymilk during storage. a higher percent of survival was also noted for both the starter organisms when the dried fermented soymilk was stored at 4 degrees c than 25 degrees c. holding the dried fermented soymilk in the laminated pouch enabled s. thermophilus and b. longum to exhibit a higher percentage of survival than in the deoxidant- and desiccant-containing glass or polyester (pet) bottle. among all the packaging materials and storage temperatures tested, starter organisms were most stable in the dried fermented soymilk held in laminated pouch and stored at 4 degrees c. under this storage condition, s. thermophilus and b. longum showed a survival percentage of 51.1% and 68.8%, respectively, in the freeze-dried fermented soymilk after 4 months of storage. meanwhile, s. thermophilus and b. infantis in the spray-dried fermented soymilk showed a survival percent of 29.5% and 57.7%, respectively.

TI == prevention of heterocyclic amine-induced dna damage in colon and liver of rats by different lactobacillus strains.
AB == the aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of four different lactobacillus (lb) strains, namely lactobacillus bulgaricus 291, streptococcus thermophilus f4, s.thermophilus v3 and bifidobacterium longum bb536, which are used for the production of yogurt, on the dna-damaging effects of heterocyclic aromatic amines (hcas). male f344 rats were treated orally with hca mixtures containing 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine, 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline, 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethyl-3h-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline, 2-amino-9h-pyrido[2,3-b]indole and 2-amino-3-methyl-3h- imidazo[4,5-f]quinoline, which were representative of the hca contents found in fried beef ('beef mix') and chicken ('chicken mix'). suspensions of lb were given by gavage to the animals simultaneously with and at different time periods before administration of the hcas. subsequently, the extent of dna migration was measured in colon and liver cells in single cell gel electrophoresis (scge) assays. all four strains caused complete inhibition of dna damage induced with beef mix after administration of 1 x 1010 lb cells/animal, whereas with chicken mix only marginal (non-significant) effects were seen. the inhibition of beef-induced dna damage was dose dependent and was still significant when 1 x 107 cells/animal were administered. kinetics studies showed that the protective effects were still significant when lb was given 12 h before the beef mix. a comparison of the present results with chemical analytical data from in vitro experiments suggests that the strong reduction in dna migration seen in the animals can be only partly explained by direct binding effects. the results of the present study show that lb are highly protective against the genotoxic effects of hcas under conditions which are relevant for humans and provide a possible explanation for the reduced colon cancer rates observed in some studies in individuals with either high lb counts in their feces or with a high consumption of lb-containing foods.

TI == effects of milk products fermented by bifidobacterium longum on blood lipids in rats and healthy adult male volunteers.
AB == the effects of milk products fermented by bifidobacterium longum strain bl1, a probiotic strain, on blood lipids in rats and humans were studied. rats were fed a cholesterol-enriched experimental diet, supplemented with lyophilized powders of 1) acid milk (control), 2) milk fermented with a mixed culture of ordinary yogurt starters composed of streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (sl), and 3) bifidobacterium milk fermented with the probiotic b. longum strain bl1, respectively. the bifidobacterium milk feeding brought about significant lowering of the serum concentrations of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides, in comparison with the control, while no change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration was observed. on the other hand, supplementation with sl milk resulted in only slight, nonsignificant decreases in serum lipid concentrations in comparison with the control. in the human study, 32 subjects with serum total cholesterol ranging from 220 to 280 mg/dl were randomly assigned to two treatments: 1) intake of a low-fat drinking yogurt prepared with ordinary yogurt starters composed of s. thermophilus and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (p-group) and 2) intake of a low-fat drinking yogurt prepared with the two ordinary yogurt starters plus b. longum strain bl1 (b-group). after intake for 4 wk at 3 x 100 ml/day, reduction of serum total cholesterol was observed in approximately half of the b-group subjects; a particularly significant decrease in serum total cholesterol was found among subjects with moderate hypercholesterolemia (serum total cholesterol > 240 mg/dl). however, the serum lipid concentrations in the p-group subjects were almost stable during the experimental periods. the present results indicate the potential of the probiotic b. longum strain bl1 in serum lipid improvement.

AB == the effect of probiotic cultures over listeria monocytogenes during the production and storage of yogurt was evaluated. a yogurt mixture (10.6% non-fat solid liquids, 3% fat and 0.3% gelatin) was prepared, homogenized and pasteurized. yogurt was inoculated with 0, 10(2), 10(4) and 10(6) cfu/ml of l. monocytogenes and 0.02% of traditional lactic culture yc 180 (streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus) and probiotic culture aby-1 (bifidobacterium longum, b. bifidum, b, infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus y lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus). it was incubated for 3 h at 43 degrees c until ph reached an approximate value of 4.8, followed by refrigeration at 5 degrees c for 21 days. during fermentation, samples were taken every hour, and during storage every 3 days, analyzing ph and lactic, bifidobacteria and pathogen count for each time. it was demonstrated that there was no significant simple effect for the type of culture used (aby-1 and yc 180) (p = 0.684) over the amount of l. monocytogenes present in yogurt during the fermentation and storage periods. the presence of bifidobacteria in the aby-1 culture did not present a significant effect over l. monocytogenes. neither the effect of time presented a significant effect over l. monocytogenes (p = 0.448). in this case, the aby-1 and yc 180 cultures present a bacteriostatic effect over the pathogen. the probiotic cultures had a bacteriostatic but not bactericidal effect over l. monocytogenes. this is not related to the protective effect of these cultures in bowel, since in-vivo conditions favor the production of antimicrobial substances, such as bacteriocins that act over pathogens.

TI == [combination use of kampo-medicines and drugs affecting intestinal bacterial flora].
AB == the intestinal bacteria, eubacterium sp. and bifidobacterium sp., participate in  the metabolism of active kampo-ingredients, glycyrrhizin (gl), sennoside (sen) and baicalin (bl). since antibiotics and bacterial preparations, bifidobacterium longum (lac-b), clostridium butyricum (miya-bm), and streptococcus faecalis (biofermin), affect the bacterial population in intestinal bacterial flora, metabolism of the active kampo-ingredients in the bacterial flora may be altered by their combined administration. we investigated 1199 prescriptions including kampo-medicines for 308 patients. combination use of kampo-medicines with antibiotics and bacterial preparations occurred with 7% and 10% of the kampo-prescription, respectively. most antibiotics have activity against intestinal bacteria, except that cephems and macrolides are not active against to e. coli. this means that antibiotics may lower the metabolism of gl, sen and bl when administered in combination. on the other hand, it is also highly possible that bacterial preparations increase the number of eubacterium sp. and bifidobacterium sp., resulting in enhanced metabolism of gl and sen when they are used concomitantly with kampo-medicines. the present results suggested that the drug interactions of kampo-medicines with antibiotics and bacterial preparations should be confirmed in clinical studies.

TI == production of oligosaccharides in yogurt containing bifidobacteria and yogurt cultures.
AB == yogurts were prepared by using yogurt cultures combined to mixed cultures of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, and bifidobacterium longum) and by adding a preincubation step (1.5 h at 50 degrees c) with bifidobacteria to the conventional method of manufacture in order to produce oligosaccharides. the survival of bifidobacteria was drastically affected during storage of yogurts, except for products containing b. animalis, in which viable counts remained at >10(6) cfu/g after 28 d of storage at 4 degrees c. oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization of 3 were produced during the preincubation step (0.31 to 0.68%), and the amount in the final products varied according to the species of bifidobacteria inoculated during the preincubation step or the concentration of bifidobacteria used as second inoculum during the fermentation process. in fact, the higher concentration of oligosaccharides measured at the end of the fermentation process (0.72%) and the 28 d-storage period (0.67%) was obtained for yogurts containing b. infantis. however, yogurts containing b. breve showed higher beta-galactosidase activities and had lower lactose concentrations after the fermentation process and the storage period than the other yogurts. the use of a mixed cultures of bifidobacteria (b. animalis, b. infantis, or b. breve) thus allows the production of yogurts in which bifidobacteria can survive in relatively high cell numbers and contain appreciable amount of oligosaccharides.

TI == thin layer chromatographic determination of organic acids for rapid identification of bifidobacteria at genus level.
AB == this study presents a simple and fast method for the identification of bifidobacteria using a thin layer chromatographic (tlc) analysis of the short chain fatty acids in a culture broth. when the chromatogram was sprayed with the indicator solution (methyl red-bromophenol blue in 70% ethanol), lactic acid exhibited two red spots, and acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid all produced blue spots. succinic acid and citric acid produced yellow and dark yellow spot, respectively. in addition, these organic acids showed different r(f) values. the total time taken to analyze the organic acids in the 10 bacterial culture broths using the proposed method was approximately 50 min. the proposed tlc method was used to analyze the organic acids in culture broths of the following strains, five bifidobacterium species. (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. bifidum, and b. adolescentis) and five other lactic acid bacteria strains (lactobacillus casei, l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus, and s. lactis). both spots of lactic acid and acetic acid were detected on all the tlc plates from the five bifidobacterial culture broths. the five other lactic acid bacterial culture broths, however, only exhibited lactic acid spots. accordingly, the proposed tlc method would appear to be a useful tool for rapid identification of bifidobacterium spp. at the genus level.

AB == canestrato pugliese cheeses from ewe milk were produced according to a traditional protocol and by adding 7.0 log10 cfu of fresh cells per gram of bifidobacterium bifidum bb02, bifidobacterium longum bb46, or both species. the traditional technology was modified slightly to favor the survival of probiotic microorganisms. after 56 d of ripening, the survival of b. bifidum bb02 and b. longum bb46 was 6.0 and 5.0 log10 cfu/g, respectively. after 19 d cheeses contained ca. 7.0 log10 cfu/g of bifidobacteria. compared to traditional cheese, the addition of bifidobacteria seemed to support the growth and survival of mesophilic lactobacilli and streptococcus thermophilus, used as starter, during ripening. no significant differences were observed in the main chemical composition, and only a slightly higher concentration of acetic acid was found in cheeses with bifidobacteria added. on the contrary, alpha- and beta-galactosidase activities were markedly more pronounced in the presence of bifidobacteria, especially with b. bifidum bb02. in contrast with traditional cheese, the lactose was completely hydrolyzed in cheeses made with bifidobacteria. urea-page electrophoresis of the ph 4.6-soluble and ph 4.6-insoluble n fractions did not show appreciable variations. only the reversed-phase-hplc analysis of the ph 4.6-soluble n showed a slightly more complex profile in the presence of bifidobacteria. this finding was in agreement with the higher value of the ph 4.6-soluble n/total n ratio and with the more pronounced amino-, imino-, and dipeptidase activities found in all the cheeses with the bifidobacteria added, especially b. bifidum bb02. no differences were found in the free amino acid and free fatty acid contents. the amino acids glutamic acid, valine, proline, leucine, and lysine and the fatty acids butyric, caproic, capric, and oleic acids were found at the highest concentrations. the sensory evaluation did not show significant differences, and canestrato pugliese cheeses were characterized by small and uniformly distributed eyes, were pale yellow, had an elastic consistency and a pecorino-like smell, were very salty, and tended to be moderately piquant.

TI == formulations and processing of yogurt affect the microbial quality of carbonated  yogurt.
AB == carbonation, flavor, culture type, ph, and storage time were varied to investigate the effects of these variables and their interactions on the growth of both typical and nontypical yogurt cultures and some contaminating bacteria. two types of yogurt cultures (yc-470 and yc-180) were used as the source of typical yogurt bacteria, streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. in addition, lactobacillus acidophilus (la-k) and bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707 were added as nontypical yogurt cultures to make sweetened low fat (1%) swiss-style plain, strawberry, and lemon yogurts. samples were incubated at 43 degrees c until ph values of 5.0 or 4.2 were reached. strawberry yogurts at low (4.2) and high (5.0) phs were divided into three portions, which were separately inoculated with contaminating bacteria, bacillus licheniformis atcc 14580, escherichia coli atcc 11775, and listeria monocytogenes scott a. after incorporation of carbon dioxide (1.10 to 1.27 volume of co2 gas dissolved in water), the yogurt was stored at 4 degrees c for a 90-d period. carbon dioxide did not affect the growth of typical or nontypical yogurt bacteria. also, co2 did not inhibit the growth of undesirable microorganisms. in general, low levels of co2 did not affect the bacterial population in yogurt. the microflora of yogurt were influenced by culture type, ph, flavor type, and storage time or their interactions.

AB == objective: to evaluate the potential of biotherapeutic agents (microorganisms with therapeutic properties) for the prevention and/or treatment of selected intestinal and vaginal infections. data sources: the medline database was searched for all relevant articles published between 1966 and september 1995. search terms used were biotherapeutic agent, probiotic, lactobacillus, saccharomyces, bifidobacterium, candida, gastrointestinal- system, vaginitis, vaginosis-bacterial, and related terms. the bibliographies of obtained articles were also reviewed. study selection and data extraction: all placebo-controlled human studies on biotherapeutic agents were reviewed. english-language open trials, case series and reports, and animal studies were reviewed only if they were especially relevant to providing information on the potential efficacy, adverse effects, or mechanisms of action of these agents. data synthesis: placebo-controlled studies have shown that biotherapeutic agents have been used successfully to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea (lactobacillus caseigg, bifidobacterium longum, b longum with l acidophilus, and saccharomyces boulardii), to prevent acute infantile diarrhea (bifidobacterium bifidum with streptococcus thermophilus), to treat recurrent clostridium difficile disease (s boulardii), and to treat various other diarrheal illnesses (enterococcus faecium sf68, l caseigg, and s boulardii). there is also evidence for lactobacillus acidophilus in the prevention of candidal vaginitis. few adverse effects have been reported. however, many of the studies tested only small numbers of patients or volunteers. conclusions: there is now evidence that administration of selected microorganisms is beneficial in the prevention and treatment of certain intestinal and, possibly, treatment of vaginal infections. in an effort to decrease the reliance on antimicrobials, the time has come to carefully explore the therapeutic applications of biotherapeutic agents.

AB == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are proposed to have several beneficial effects, including the inactivation of carcinogens. we have studied the potential of lactobacillus acidophilus (from a commercially available yogurt), lactobacillus gasseri (p79), lactobacillus confusus (dsm20196), streptococcus thermophilus (ncim 50083), bifidobacterium breve and bifidobacterium longum (from human infant stool) to prevent the induction of dna damage by n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng, 7.5 mg/kg body wt) in colon cells of the rat. using the new technique of single cell microgel electrophoresis, all investigated strains were antigenotoxic toward mnng after a single dose of 10(10) viable cells/kg body wt p.o. eight hours before the carcinogen. one-half and one-tenth of this initial dose resulted in a loss of protective activity. high doses of heat-treated l. acidophilus strains were also not antigenotoxic. one mechanism of the preventive effect could be that bacterial metabolites or components are responsible. accordingly, selected examples were investigated in vitro in colon cells of the rat. metabolically active l. acidophilus cells, as well as an acetone extract of the culture, prevented mnng-induced dna damage. different cell fractions from l. acidophilus (cytoplasm, cell wall skeleton, cell wall) were devoid of antigenotoxic activity, whereas the peptidoglycan fraction and whole freeze-dried cells were antigenotoxic. as a second carcinogen, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh) was used. a dose- and time-response study was first performed to assess the effects of dmh in several segments of the gastrointestinal (gi) tract. exposure for 16 hours to 15 or 25 mg dmh/kg body wt p.o. induced dna damage in cells of the distal colon of rats, whereas no cytotoxicity was seen. pretreatment orally with lab on four consecutive mornings before dmh gavage (8 hours after the last lab application) revealed that l. acidophilus, l. confusus, l. gasseri, b. longum, and b. breve inhibited the genotoxic effect of dmh. one of four s. thermophilus and one of three lactobacillus delbrueckeii ssp. bulgaricus strains were also protective. heat-treated l. acidophilus did not inhibit dmh-induced genotoxicity. a few aliquots of the colon cells were processed immunohistochemically for the presence of the "proliferation cell nuclear antigen" (pcna). dmh treatment did not increase pcna, nor was there any modulation by lab. the effect of l. acidophilus on foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes (phase i and phase ii) in liver and colon cells of rats revealed only one parameter to be modulated, namely, a two- to three-fold increase in the levels of nadph-cytochrome p-450 reductase. the meaning of this finding, in terms of possible chemoprevention by lab, remains unclear. in conclusion, our studies show that most, but not all, lab tested could strongly inhibit genotoxicity in the gi tract of the rat and that viable lab organisms are required for the protective effect in vivo. the comet assay technique is a powerful tool to elucidate such in vivo antigenotoxic activities in tumor target tissues.

TI == absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium.
AB == to investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum, lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. the production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by hplc analysis in growing cultures. resting whole cells from a positive control strain, eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of .2 mm cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at ph 7.3. however, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. in growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by e. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. none of the test strains showed production of either deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.

TI == microbiological evaluation of jejunal aspirates and faecal samples after oral administration of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria.
AB == a double-blind placebo controlled investigation was carried out to study the effect of peroral colonization. human volunteers were given mixtures of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria. measurements were made over a 1 week treatment period and for another week after the end of the treatment. two different bacteriological preparations were used, one consisted of enterococcus faecium and bifidobacterium longum (a total of 6.4 x 10(8) cfu d-1); the other consisted of lactobacillus acidophilus, bif. bifidum, lact. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus (a total of 9 x 10(9) cfu d-1). together with a placebo preparation, they were given to 24 healthy controls (eight in each group). microbiological examinations of jejunal aspirates showed that viable counts of most species were below the detection limit. however, the test preparation containing ent. faecium and bif. longum significantly reduced the anaerobe: aerobe ratio in faeces by a factor of three during treatment (p = 0.03), and increased it by a factor of 30 during the following week (p < 0.02). this study shows that peroral administration of certain bacterial cultures may affect the distal intestinal microflora.

TI == analysis of intestinal flora of a patient with congenital absence of the portal vein.
AB == a 14-year-old female patient, admitted for a closer examination of liver tumour (hepatocellular adenoma), was diagnosed as having a congenital absence of the portal vein. the blood ammonia level (approximately 120 micrograms dl-1) in the superior mesenteric vein was markedly low compared to the normal value of 300-350 micrograms dl-1 in the portal vein. the decreased ammonia concentration and urease activity of the patient's faeces were demonstrated. the dominant intestinal flora in the faeces of the patient, before operation, was bifidobacterium sp., bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium lonqum, lactobacillus plantarum, and after the operation bacteroides vulgatus, veillonella parvula, peptococcus magnus bifidobacterium longum. in contrast, bifidobacterium bifidum, bacteroides ureolyticus, bacteroides ovatus and bacteroides distasonis, b. ovatus, bifidobacterium adolescentis were dominant flora in the faeces of two healthy volunteers, respectively. among microorganisms isolated from the patient, morganella morganii, candida sp., eubacterium aerofacience and eubacterium rectale were strongly positive in urease activity in vitro; streptococcus mitior, staphylococcus intermedius, micrococcus kristinae, selenomonas ruminantum, bacteroides ureolyticus and lactobacillus casei ss. pseudoplantarum from the healthy volunteers. these results imply the homeostatic regulation system of faecal ammonia concentration by urease-producing microorganisms in the patient.

TI == [the range of antigenic specificity of bifidobacterium peptidoglycan].
AB == the antigenic relationships of bifidobacterium bifidum 1 peptidoglycans with different strains of this species (lva-3, 791, go-4), bifidobacteria of other species (b. adolescentis go-13, b. breve 79-38, b. lactentis 79-41, b. longum go-3) and bacteria of remote taxonomic groups (streptococcus faecalis 6-3. staphylococcus aureus com 885, s. epidermidis com 2124. lactobacillus plantarum 1, escherichia coli m-17) were studied on the basis of a highly sensitive test system permitting the registration of normal human antibodies to peptidoglycans. the level of cross reactions with staphylococci and streptococci correspond to intraspecific and antigenic affinity to l. plantarum and e. coli was considerably less pronounced. copying a number of epitopes of bifidobacteria, s. aureus peptidoglycan seems to possess additional antigenic determinants which participate in the formation of immunological responsiveness in man.

TI == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603 was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.

TI == inhibitory effect of some intestinal bacteria on liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic c3h/he male mice.
AB == liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic c3h/he male mice was markedly promoted by association with a bacterial combination of escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, and clostridium paraputrificum. this study demonstrated that this promoting effect was suppressed by addition of certain intestinal bacteria, such as bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, and eubacterium rectale.

TI == streptococcus faecium-derived antibacterial substance antagonistic to bifidobacteria.
AB == an antagonistic strain of streptococcus faecium was isolated from human feces, and it displayed a marked inhibition of bifidobacteria on agar plates. in liquid culture this isolate produced an antibacterial substance that can be partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography. its activity was assayed by the inhibition of growth of bifidobacterium longum. the substance was sensitive to digestion by proteolytic enzymes and alpha-amylase, but was resistant to treatment with 6 m urea, dithiothreitol, 2-mercaptoethanol, ethyl ether, chloroform, and lysozyme. it was also stable to heating at 100 degrees c for 60 min. its molecular weight was estimated to be about 50,000 by gel filtration.
