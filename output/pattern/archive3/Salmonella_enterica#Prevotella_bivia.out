in vitro antibacterial activity of lactobacillus helveticus strain ks300 against  diarrhoeagenic, uropathogenic and vaginosis-associated bacteria.
aims: the purpose of this study was to investigate in vitro the antibacterial activity of the lactobacillus helveticus strain ks300 against vaginosis-associated bacteria including gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella bivia, uropathogenic escherichia coli, and diarrhoeagenic salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. methods and results: the ks300 strain inhibited the growth of g. vaginalis, p. bivia, s. typhimurium, and pathogenic e. coli. after direct co-culture, data show that the lactobacillus strain decreased the viability of g. vaginalis, p. bivia, s. typhimurium, and pathogenic e. coli. the adhering ks300 strain inhibited the adhesion of g. vaginalis dsm 4944 and uropathogenic dr-positive e. coli ih11128 onto hela cells. moreover, the ks300 strain inhibited the internalization of uropathogenic dr-positive e. coli ih11128 within hela cells and s. typhimurium sl1344 within caco-2/tc7 cells. conclusions: the findings demonstrate that l. helveticus strain ks300 is adhesive onto cultured human cells and has antagonistic activities against vaginosis-associated, uropathogenic and diarrhoeagenic pathogens. significance and impact of the study: adhering l. helveticus strain ks300 is a potential probiotic strain displaying a strain-specific array of in vitro antibacterial activities.
