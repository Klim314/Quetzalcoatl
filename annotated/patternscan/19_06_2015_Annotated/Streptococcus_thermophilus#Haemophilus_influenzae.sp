TI  == ingested probiotics reduce nasal colonization with pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-hemolytic streptococci).
AB  == background: as a bacterial reservoir, the nose may harbor potentially pathogenic  bacteria (ppb: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and haemophilus influenzae). in patients carrying ppb, antiseptic regimens could be crucial for infection control after major operations on or injuries of the head, nasal sinuses, or lungs. such regimens may also be important for diabetic patients and persons receiving hemodialysis, in intensive  care units, or with impaired immunity due to various other causes. objective: we  tested a possible effect of the ingestion of probiotics on the bacterial flora of the nose. design: in an open, prospective trial, 209 volunteers were randomly assigned to consume either a probiotic, fermented milk drink [65 ml with lactobacillus gg (atcc 53103), bifidobacterium sp b420, lactobacillus acidophilus 145, and streptococcus thermophilus; n = 108] or standard yogurt (180 g; n = 101) daily for 3 wk. nasal microbial flora were analyzed on days 1, 21, and 28. the microbial examination was blinded to the source of the samples. results: we found a significant reduction (19%; p < 0.001) in the occurrence of nasal ppb in the group who consumed the probiotic drink but not in the group who consumed yogurt.  the effect was mainly on gram-positive bacteria, which decreased significantly (p < 0.05). conclusions: the results indicate that regular intake of probiotics can  reduce ppb in the upper respiratory tract. the results also indicate a linkage of the lymphoid tissue between the gut and the upper respiratory tract.

TI  == identification, cloning, and expression of a functional phenylalanyl-trna synthetase (phers) from staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == phenylalanyl-trna synthetase (phers) is unique among aminoacyl trna synthetases in that it is a heterotetrameric enzyme composed of two alpha-subunits and two larger beta-subunits. in prokaryotes, the alpha- and beta-subunits of phers are encoded by the genes phes and phet, respectively. in this report we describe the  isolation of a dna fragment (3.52 kb) containing the phes and phet genes from a staphylococcus aureus (wcuh29) genomic dna library. both genes, found as a part of transcriptional operon, were predicted to encode polypeptides which showed strong primary and structural similarity to prokaryotic phenylalanyl-trna synthetase alpha- and beta- subunits. we describe the high-level overexpression and purification of recombinant s. aureus phers using phes and phet genes as part of an artificial operon in escherichia coli. for comparative analysis we also report a procedure for the purification of native phers from s. aureus (oxford strain) and demonstrate that michaelis-menten parameters for both recombinant and native enzyme, at least for phenylalanine trna aminoacylation are comparable.

TI  == analysis of the icsba locus required for biosynthesis of the inner core region from neisseria meningitidis lipopolysaccharide.
AB  == by deletion mutagenesis in the entire meningococcal chromosome, we have previously identified the icsa gene, which encodes the glycosyltransferase required for adding glcnac to hep-ii in the inner core of meningococcal lps. this gene has homology to several lps glycosyltransferases, notably to rfak from salmonella typhimurium and bplh from bordetella pertussis, both of which encode glcnac transferases. directly upstream of icsa is an orf showing significant homology to the hypothetical protein hi0653 from the haemophilus influenzae genome sequence, and to a lesser degree to putative glycosyltransferases from streptococcus thermophilus and yersinia enterocolitica. insertional inactivation  of this orf resulted in a meningococcal strain with truncated lps. we have named  this new lps-involved gene icsb. differences in binding of monoclonal antibodies  and in mobility on tricine-sds-page showed that lps from icsa and icsb mutants is similar but not identical. on the basis of these results, we postulated that the  new gene encodes the glycosyltransferase required for adding glc to hep-i. structural analysis of purified mutant lps by electrospray mass spectrometry was  used to verify this hypothesis. the composition determined for icsa and icsb is lipida-(kdo)2-(hep)2.pea and lipida-(kdo)2-(hep)2.pea-glcnac, respectively. the icsa and icsb genes thus form an operon encoding the glycosyltransferases required for chain elongation from the lipida-(kdo)2-(hep)2 basal structure, with icsa first adding glcnac to hep-ii and icsb subsequently adding glc to hep-i. only then is completion of the lacto-n-neotetraose structure possible through the action of the igta-e genes.
