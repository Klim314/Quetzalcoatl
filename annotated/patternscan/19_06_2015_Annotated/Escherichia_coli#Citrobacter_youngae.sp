TI  == detection of escherichia coli colonies on confluent plates of chromogenic media used in membrane filtration.
AB  == mi agar (mi), chromocult(r) coliform agar es (chromocult), and dc with bcig agar  (dc) are chromogenic membrane filtration culture-based methods used to assess microbiological water quality. in this study, their ability to detect escherichia coli colonies on confluent growth plates was determined by testing water samples  containing increasing concentrations of a non-e. coli growing bacterium, citrobacter youngae. then, their ability to inhibit the growth of non-coliform bacteria was determined by simultaneously testing 603 well water samples. results were compared with those obtained with mfc and colilert(r) methods. results showed that the e. coli count was difficult to determine on mfc, chromocult and dc when non-e. coli colonies reached levels of 10(4)colony forming units (cfu)/100 ml. however, the e. coli count did not interfere with colilert until non-e. coli colonies reached concentrations of 10(7)cfu/100 ml. no inhibition was observed with mi as e. coli colonies could be easily detected in the presence of  at least 10(7)cfu/100 ml of c. youngae. using well water samples, confluent growth plates were observed for 144, 177, and 185 of the 603 well water samples tested with the mi, chromocult and dc methods, respectively. among these confluent growth plates, e. coli colonies were not detected for 10, 20, and 31 water samples. however, they were detected by the mfc and/or colilert methods. thus, among the three methods tested, the mi method presented the lowest grow rate of atypic colonies and was the only one that presents no interference in the e. coli count.

TI  == no evidence so far for the dissemination of carbapenemase-producing enterobactericeae in the community in switzerland.
AB  == background: carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae represent an increasing threat to public health and to the treatment of serious nosocomial infections. the aim of this study was to screen for the presence of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae in human carriers in community settings in switzerland, a country representative of central europe. findings: three hundred and fourteen stool samples of healthy staff members of a meat-processing company and 291 fecal swabs from primary care patients were recovered in switzerland between april 2012 and july 2012 and were tested for carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates by selecting for growth on a carbapenem-containing selective medium. six resulting isolates (5 escherichia coli and 1 citrobacter youngae) were subjected  to antimicrobial susceptibility tests and pcr analysis by screening for the carbapenemase genes bla oxa-48, bla vim, bla ndm-1, and bla kpc as well as for the extended-spectrum ss-lactamase genes bla tem, bla shv, bla ctx-m and bla cmy-2. no carbapenemase genes were detected. resistance to ss-lactam antibiotics  was due to carriage of the extended-spectrum ss-lactamase ctx-m-15 in 4 isolates, to ctx-m-14 in one further isolate and to the plasmidic ampc-ss-lactamase cmy-2 in one isolate. conclusions: these results show that carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae are as yet not present in the community. continuous surveillance is necessary to anticipate future trends in the prevalence and dissemination of carbapenem resistant isolates in the population.

TI  == the bactericidal activity of normal human serum against enterobacteriaceae rods with lipopolysaccharides possessing o-antigens composed of mannan.
AB  == background: the susceptibility of bacteria to the bactericidal activity of serum  depends on the structure and organization of the bacterial outer membrane. it is  known that the structure of the o-specific polysaccharide chain of lipopolysaccharide (lps) plays an important role in the resistance of bacteria to host immune defenses. objectives: the susceptibility of rods belonging to enterobacteriaceae family to the bactericidal activity of the normal human serum  (nhs) was examined. the mechanisms of complement activation were also investigated. material and methods: the study was carried out on 15 strains containing lpss with o-specific polysaccharides composed of mannan, belonging to  the following species: citrobacter freundii, c. werkmanii, c. braakii, c. youngae, hafnia alvei, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. the levels of  c3 and c4 complement components, igg and igm immunoglobulin in nhs were examined  using specific antibodies. the bactericidal activity of nhs and its preparations  (hs50/20, hsmgegta) was determined. lpss from e. coli 08 strains were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page) in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate (sds). results: eleven strains were sensitive to nhs bactericidal activity, and four were resistant. only one group of strains was fully susceptible to nhs action. in three other groups, both sensitive and resistant strains were found. the majority of the strains remained susceptible to nhs activity irrespective of which pathway of serum activity was blocked. all e. coli 08 strains contained smooth-type lpss. conclusions: strains belonging to the same serotype showed variable susceptibility to the bactericidal action of normal human serum. two mechanisms of the bactericidal activity of nhs have been identified.

TI  == postprocessing microflora of commercial attieke (a fermented cassava product) produced in the south of cote d'ivoire.
AB  == the distribution and presence of hygiene indicator and pathogenic micro-organisms in 375 samples of attieke marketed in cote d'ivoire, and their roles in the food  poisoning were evaluated. microbiological analyses were carried out, which included the total viable bacteria, coliforms, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella, bacillus spores, fungi and clostridium perfringens. the results revealed that the viable bacteria counts ranged from 2.2 +/- 1.2 x 10(5)  to 3.4 +/- 1.4 x 10(6) cfu g(-1), while the yeasts and the moulds counts ranged,  respectively, from 2.4 +/- 0.12 x 10(4) to 9.8 +/- 0.4 x 10(5) cfu g(-1) and 1.3  +/- 0.7 x 10(1) to 1.7 +/- 0.7 x 10(2) cfu g(-1). bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter freundi, enterobacter amnigenus, citrobacter youngae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter agglomerans and klebsiella oxytoca were the bacteria isolated, and rhizopus spp., mucor spp., thamnidium spp., fusarium spp., moniliella spp. the fungi. escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens and salmonella spp. were not found. the occurrence of some bacteria and fungi illustrate that attieke collected in cote d'ivoire markets may act as a reservoir of pathogenic micro-organisms for human. significance and impact of study: this study demonstrates the great need to carry out microbiological tests frequently on attieke and even more the need to apply correct haccp system during the production. attieke is especially a well-known product in west africa; hence, it  is extremely important to ensure an adequate microbiological quality to guarantee consumers health. overall, the study highlighted the need for effective communication on microbiological food risks, proper instruction and supervision in food-handling procedures, greater education on food safety risks.

TI  == fecal carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in swine and cattle at slaughter in switzerland.
AB  == during the past decade, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae have become a matter of great concern in human medicine. esbl-producing strains are found in the community, not just in hospital-associated patients, which raises a question about possible reservoirs.  recent studies describe the occurrence of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae in meat, fish, and raw milk; therefore, the impact of food animals as reservoirs for and disseminators of such strains into the food production chain must be assessed. in this pilot study, fecal samples of 59 pigs and 64 cattle were investigated to determine the occurrence of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae in  farm animals at slaughter in switzerland. presumptive-positive colonies on brilliance esbl agar were subjected to identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing including the disc diffusion method and e-test esbl strips. as many as 15.2% of the porcine and 17.1% of the bovine samples, predominantly from calves, yielded esbl producers. of the 21 isolated strains, 20 were escherichia coli, and one was citrobacter youngae. pcr analysis revealed that 18 strains including c. youngae produced ctx-m group 1 esbls, and three strains carried genes encoding for ctx-m group 9 enzymes. in addition, eight isolates were pcr positive for tem beta-lactamase, but no bla(shv) genes were detected. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed a high genetic diversity within the strains. the relatively high rates of occurrence of esblproducing strains in  food animals and the high genetic diversity among these strains indicate that there is an established reservoir of these organisms in farm animals. further studies are necessary to assess future trends.

TI  == production of biogenic amines "in vitro" in relation to the growth phase by enterobacteriaceae species isolated from traditional sausages.
AB  == histidine, lysine, ornithine and tyrosine decarboxylase activities were tested in 79 strains of enterobacteriaceae (41 of hafnia alvei, 17 of serratia liquefaciens, 5 of enterobacter cloacae, 4 of citrobacter braakii, 2 of proteus vulgaris, 2 of proteus mirabilis, 2 of providencia stuartii, 2 of klebsiella terrigena, 1 of rahnella aquatilis, 1 of salmonella arizonae, 1 of citrobacter youngae and 1 of escherichia coli) isolated from botillo, a spanish traditional sausage. in general, the strains were positive for all four activities, with the  exception of two strains of h. alvei and the e. coli strain, which did not display histidine decarboxylase activity. the strains of p. mirabilis and p. stuartii did not exhibit any of the four activities tested. accumulation of putrescine and cadaverine was studied throughout growth of the 75 strains that displayed ornithine and lysine decarboxylase activities. biogenic amines were produced particularly in the exponential phase, with maximum accumulation occurring after between 12 to 72 h, depending on the biogenic amine and microbial species considered. maximum accumulation of putrescine varied greatly between species and within the same species, and ranged from 18 mg/l in the r. aquatilis  strain to 7325 mg/l in a h. alvei strain. maximum accumulation of cadaverine varied less than that of putrescine, and ranged from 30 mg/l in the r. aquatilis  strain to 1935 mg/l in a s. liquefaciens strain.

TI  == analysis of ampc beta-lactamase expression and sequence in biochemically atypical ceftazidime-resistant enterobacteriaceae from paediatric patients.
AB  == objectives: to analyse the variation of ampc beta-lactamase gene sequence and expression in biochemically atypical enterobacteriaceae isolates, and to identify them definitively. methods: beta-lactamase gene-containing recombinant plasmids transformed into escherichia coli were selected using ampicillin. pcr analysis was used to locate specific ampc and 16s rrna genes, and the amplicons were sequenced. random amplified polymorphic dna pcr was used to group isolates and api 20e biochemical profiling was used to identify them putatively. results: of 50 ceftazidime-resistant clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates, 36 were identified (>95% confidence)-using api 20e test strips-as being organisms known to express inducible class c beta-lactamases (citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, morganella morganii or hafnia alvei). the rest were biochemically atypical. of these, isolate i113, putatively identified as e. coli, possesses a chromosomally  encoded ampc which differs by 15% from c. freundii os60 ampc and by >30% from e.  coli ampc. a related ampc gene was found in another seven of the atypical isolates. the use of various identification methods, including ampc sequence analysis, revealed that these i113-like ampc-positive isolates represent citrobacter murliniae and citrobacter youngae. conclusions: we report sequences for two new citrobacter spp. ampc genes, and provide evidence that ampc sequencing is a discriminatory method for identifying atypical citrobacter spp. isolates.

TI  == occurrence of a new metallo-beta-lactamase imp-4 carried on a conjugative plasmid in citrobacter youngae from the people's republic of china.
AB  == during the course of an antimicrobial resistance surveillance programme in guangzhou, the people's republic of china, single strains of citrobacter youngae  and pseudomonas aeruginosa were identified which were resistant to imipenem and found to carry the carbapenemase gene bla(imp). pcr screening of the citrobacter  strain with specific primers for the bla(imp) type genes gave a 587-bp product which when sequenced gave 100% homology with the bla(imp-4) sequence reported recently from acinetobacter spp. the determinant in the c. youngae strain was found to be located on a 156-kb plasmid capable of transfer to escherichia coli ub1637 by conjugation. sequencing of the bla(imp-4) open reading frame in the c.  youngae strain and adjacent sequences not only confirmed the presence of bla(imp-4) but also identified that a conserved core site found within the 59-bp  element of integrons was present and the same as the one described in the only other occurrence of bla(imp-4) in acinetobacter spp. isolated from an intensive care unit in hong kong. this is the second report of transferable carbapenemase genes in enterobacteriaciae outside of japan and the first in the people's republic of china. under the selective pressure of carbapenems and extended spectrum cephalosporins use we might expect this gene to spread and widespread surveillance should be instituted.

TI  == re-speciation of the original reference strains of serovars in the citrobacter freundii (bethesda-ballerup group) antigenic scheme of west and edwards.
AB  == the antigenic scheme for the bethesda-ballerup group of bacteria established by west and edwards in 1954 has continued to be applied as a serotyping scheme for citrobacter freundii. in 1993, however, the classification of the citrobacter was drastically revised and the species c. freundii redefined by brenner et al. accordingly, to judge the propriety to continuously use a single antigenic scheme for the c. freundii complex, the 90 reference strains listed in the antigenic scheme for c. freundii by west and edwards were characterized phenotypically and  specified based on the revised classification. of these 90 strains, two strains of hafnia alvei and one of escherichia coli were found. among the remaining 87 reference strains, citrobacter youngae was the predominant species (40 strains),  followed by citrobacter braakii (25 strains), citrobacter werkmanii (13 strains), and the unnamed citrobacter genospecies 10 of brenner et al (six strains). citrobacter freundii, as redefined, accounted for only three strains and ranked behind the other four species. no overlapping with most of the 42 o-groups and 82 h-antigens was recognized between species with few exceptions. o-groups 1-9 inclusive, which were estimated to represent more than 90% of the former c.freundii strains, occurred in strains of c. youngae and c. braakii; and all nine strains of o-group 29, formerly known as the ballerup group, were identified as c. braakii. these findings suggest that further study of the serotyping system is needed for all h2s-producing citrobacter species.
