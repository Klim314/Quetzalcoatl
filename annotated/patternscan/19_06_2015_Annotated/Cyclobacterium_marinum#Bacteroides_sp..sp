TI  == aquiflexum balticum gen. nov., sp. nov., a novel marine bacterium of the cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides group isolated from surface water of the central baltic sea.
AB  == a bacterial isolate from the baltic sea, ba160(t), was characterized for its physiological and biochemical features, fatty acid profile, g+c content and phylogenetic position based on 16s rrna gene sequences. the strain was isolated from the surface water of the central baltic sea during the decay of a plankton bloom. phylogenetic analyses of the 16s rrna gene sequence revealed a clear affiliation with the family 'flexibacteraceae', and showed the closest phylogenetic relationship with the species belliella baltica and cyclobacterium marinum. the g+c content of the dna was 38.4 mol%. the strain was red-coloured due to carotenoids, gram-negative, rod-shaped, and catalase- and oxidase-positive. growth was observed at salinities from 0 to 6 %, with an optimum around 1.5 %. temperature for growth ranged from 4 to 40 degrees c, with  an optimum around 30 degrees c. the fatty acids were dominated by branched-chain  fatty acids (>87 %), with a high abundance of iso-c(15 : 0) (23 %) and anteiso-c(15 : 0) (19 %). according to its morphology, physiology, fatty acid composition, g+c content and 16s rrna gene sequence, strain ba160(t) is considered to represent a new genus of the family 'flexibacteraceae'. due to its  aquatic origin, the name aquiflexum balticum gen. nov, sp. nov. is suggested for  the type species (type strain, ba160(t)=dsm 16537(t)=lmg 22565(t)=cip 108445(t))  of the new genus.

TI  == belliella baltica gen. nov., sp. nov., a novel marine bacterium of the cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides group isolated from surface water of the central baltic sea.
AB  == two bacterial isolates from the baltic sea, ba1 and ba134t, were characterized for their physiological and biochemical features, fatty acid profiles and phylogenetic position based on 16s rrna gene sequences. the strains were isolated from surface water of the central baltic sea during the decay of a plankton bloom. phylogenetic analysis of their 16s rrna gene sequences revealed a clear affiliation to the family 'flexibacteriaceae' and showed highest sequence similarity (91%) to cyclobacterium marinum. the g+c content of the dna was 35.4 mol%. the strains were pink-coloured due to carotinoids, gram-negative, rod-shaped and catalase- and oxidase-positive. growth was observed at 0-6% salinity, with good growth at 0-3%. temperature for growth was 4-37 degrees c, with an optimum around 25 degrees c. the fatty acid profiles were dominated by branched-chain fatty acids (70%), with a high abundance of iso-c(15:0) (29-33%),  iso-c(17:1)omega9c (7-10%) and c(17:1)omega6c (5-10%). according to their morphology, physiology, fatty acid composition, 16s rrna gene sequences and dna-dna similarity, on one hand, the described bacteria are considered to be members of the same novel species; on the other hand, they are suggested as a novel genus of the family 'flexibacteriaceae'. to honour the late aquatic microbiologist russell t. bell, the name belliella baltica gen. nov, sp. nov. is  suggested for the baltic sea isolates, for which the type strain is ba134t (=dsm  15883t=lmg 21964t=cip 108006t).
