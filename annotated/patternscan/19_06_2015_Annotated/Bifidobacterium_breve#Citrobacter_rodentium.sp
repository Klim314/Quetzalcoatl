TI  == pre-treatment with bifidobacterium breve ucc2003 modulates citrobacter rodentium-induced colonic inflammation and organ specificity.
AB  == citrobacter rodentium, which colonizes the gut mucosa via formation of attaching  and effacing (a/e) lesions, causes transmissible colonic hyperplasia. the aim of  this study was to evaluate whether prophylactic treatment with bifidobacterium breve ucc2003 can improve the outcome of c. rodentium infection. six-week-old albino c57bl/6 mice were pre-treated for 3 days with b. breve, challenged with bioluminescent c. rodentium and administered b. breve or pbs-c for 8 days post-infection; control mice were either administered b. breve and mock-infected  with pbs, or mock-treated with pbs-c and mock-infected with pbs. c. rodentium colonization was monitored by bacterial enumeration from faeces and by a combination of both 2d bioluminescence imaging (bli) and composite 3d diffuse light imaging tomography with microct imaging (dlit-microct). at day 8 post-infection, colons were removed and assessed for crypt hyperplasia, histology by light microscopy, bacterial colonization by immunofluorescence, and a/e lesion formation by electron microscopy. prophylactic administration of b. breve did not prevent c. rodentium colonization or a/e lesion formation. however, this treatment did alter c. rodentium distribution within the large intestine and significantly reduced colonic crypt hyperplasia at the peak of bacterial infection. these results show that b. breve could not competitively exclude c. rodentium, but reduced pathogen-induced colonic inflammation.

TI  == bifidobacterium breve ucc2003 surface exopolysaccharide production is a beneficial trait mediating commensal-host interaction through immune modulation and pathogen protection.
AB  == bifidobacteria constitute a substantial proportion of the human gut microbiota. there are currently many bifidobacterial strains with claimed probiotic attributes. the mechanism through which these strains reside within their host and exert benefits to the host is far from fully understood. we have shown in the case of bifidobacterium breve ucc2003 that a cell surface exopolysaccharide (eps) plays a role in in vivo persistence. biosynthesis of two possible epss is controlled by a bidirectional gene cluster which guides alternate eps synthesis by means of a reorienting promoter. the presence of eps impacts on host immune response: the wild type, eps-positive b. breve ucc2003 efficiently evades the adaptive b-cell host response, while its isogenic, eps-deficient equivalent elicits a strong adaptive immune response. functionally, eps positive strains were more resilient to presence of acid and bile and were responsible for reduced colonization levels of citrobacter rodentium, a gut pathogen. in conclusion, we have found that eps is important in host interactions and pathogen protection, the latter indicative of a probiotic ability for the eps of b. breve ucc2003.

TI  == bifidobacterial surface-exopolysaccharide facilitates commensal-host interaction  through immune modulation and pathogen protection.
AB  == bifidobacteria comprise a significant proportion of the human gut microbiota. several bifidobacterial strains are currently used as therapeutic interventions,  claiming various health benefits by acting as probiotics. however, the precise mechanisms by which they maintain habitation within their host and consequently provide these benefits are not fully understood. here we show that bifidobacterium breve ucc2003 produces a cell surface-associated exopolysaccharide (eps), the biosynthesis of which is directed by either half of  a bidirectional gene cluster, thus leading to production of one of two possible epss. alternate transcription of the two opposing halves of this cluster appears  to be the result of promoter reorientation. surface eps provided stress tolerance and promoted in vivo persistence, but not initial colonization. marked differences were observed in host immune response: strains producing surface eps  (eps(+)) failed to elicit a strong immune response compared with eps-deficient variants. specifically, eps production was shown to be linked to the evasion of adaptive b-cell responses. furthermore, presence of eps(+) b. breve reduced colonization levels of the gut pathogen citrobacter rodentium. our data thus assigns a pivotal and beneficial role for eps in modulating various aspects of bifidobacterial-host interaction, including the ability of commensal bacteria to  remain immunologically silent and in turn provide pathogen protection. this finding enforces the probiotic concept and provides mechanistic insights into health-promoting benefits for both animal and human hosts.
