TI  == reduced burden of salmonella enterica in bovine subiliac lymph nodes associated with administration of a direct-fed microbial.
AB  == despite effective food safety interventions within abattoirs, salmonella enterica remains a common contaminant of raw ground beef. research has recently implicated peripheral lymph nodes (plns) as a potential route by which salmonella contaminates ground beef. this study examined the efficacy of using lactobacillus animalis (formerly designated lactobacillus acidophilus; np51) and propionibacterium freudenreichii (np24), at 109 cfu/head/day, as a direct-fed microbial (dfm) in feedlot cattle diets to control salmonella within plns. two studies were conducted in which cattle were randomly allocated into either control or dfm treatment groups. diets of treated cattle were supplemented with 109 cfu/head/day of the dfm, while control groups received no dfm supplementation. during slaughter at abattoirs, one subiliac lymph node (sln) per carcass was collected from 627 carcasses from one study and 99 carcasses from the second study. lymph nodes were cultured to estimate the presence and concentration of salmonella. in the first study, effects of dfm supplementation varied across slaughter days. on the first and second slaughter days, prevalence  was reduced by 50% (p = 0.0072) and 31% (p = 0.0093), respectively. no significant difference was observed on slaughter day three (p = 0.1766). in the second study, salmonella was 82% less likely (p = 0.008) to be recovered from slns of treatment cattle. while a greater relative risk reduction was observed in the latter study, absolute risk reductions were similar across studies. a significant reduction in the concentration of salmonella in slns (p < 0.0001) on  a cfu/g and cfu/node basis was also observed in cattle administered np51 and np24 in the first study; in the second study, too few quantifiable slns were observed  to facilitate meaningful comparisons. the results indicate that np51 and np24 supplementation may aid in reducing the prevalence and concentration of salmonella in slns and, therefore, serve as an effective control measure to reduce salmonella in ground beef products.

TI  == probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus downregulates fcer1 and hrh4 expression in human mast cells.
AB  == aim: to investigate the effects of four probiotic bacteria and their combination  on human mast cell gene expression using microarray analysis. methods: human peripheral-blood-derived mast cells were stimulated with lactobacillus rhamnosus  (l. rhamnosus) gg (lgg((r))), l. rhamnosus lc705 (lc705), propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js (pjs) and bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb12 (bb12) and their combination for 3 or 24 h, and were subjected to global microarray analysis using an affymetrix genechip((r)) human genome u133 plus 2.0  array. the gene expression differences between unstimulated and bacteria-stimulated samples were further analyzed with gorilla gene enrichment analysis and visualization tool and mev multiexperiment viewer-tool. results: lgg and lc705 were observed to suppress genes that encoded allergy-related high-affinity ige receptor subunits alpha and gamma (fcer1a and fcer1g, respectively) and histamine h4 receptor. lgg, lc705 and the combination of four probiotics had the strongest effect on the expression of genes involved in mast cell immune system regulation, and on several genes that encoded proteins with a  pro-inflammatory impact, such as interleukin (il)-8 and tumour necrosis factor alpha. also genes that encoded proteins with anti-inflammatory functions, such as il-10, were upregulated. conclusion: certain probiotic bacteria might diminish mast cell allergy-related activation by downregulation of the expression of high-affinity ige and histamine receptor genes, and by inducing a pro-inflammatory response.

TI  == persistence of probiotic strains in the gastrointestinal tract when administered  as capsules, yoghurt, or cheese.
AB  == most clinical studies of probiotics use freeze-dried, powdered bacteria or bacteria packed in capsules. however, probiotics are commercially available in various food matrices, which may affect their persistence in the gastrointestinal tract. the objective of the study was to compare oral and faecal recovery during  and after administration of a combination of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lc705, propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii js, and bifidobacterium  animalis subsp. lactis bb12 as capsules, yoghurt, or cheese. this randomized, parallel-group, open-label trial (n=36) included a 4-week run-in, 2-week intervention, and 3-week follow-up period. participants consumed 10(10)cfu/day of probiotic combination and provided saliva and faecal samples before, during, and  after the intervention. strain-specific real-time pcr was used to quantify the strains. l. rhamnosus gg was the only probiotic strain regularly recovered in saliva samples. during the intervention period it was recovered in the saliva of  88% of the volunteers at least once. no difference was found between the yoghurt  and cheese groups. at the end of the intervention, l. rhamnosus gg and lc705 counts were high in faecal samples of all product groups (8.08 and 8.67log(10) genome copies/g, respectively). there was no matrix effect on strain quantity in  faeces or the recovery time after ceasing the intervention. for p. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii js and b. animalis subsp. lactis bb12, a matrix effect was found at the end of the intervention (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively) and in the recovery time during follow-up (p<0.05 for both). yoghurt yielded the highest faecal quantity of js and bb12 strains (8.01 and 9.89log(10) genome copies/g, respectively). the results showed that the administration matrix did not influence the faecal quantity of lactobacilli, but affected faecal counts of propionibacteria and bifidobacteria that were lower when consumed in cheese. thus, the consumption of probiotics in yoghurt matrix is highly suitable for studying potential health benefits and capsules provide a comparable means of administration when the viability of the strain in the capsule product is confirmed.

TI  == probiotic intervention has strain-specific anti-inflammatory effects in healthy adults.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the effects of three potentially anti-inflammatory probiotic bacteria from three different genera on immune variables in healthy adults in a clinical setting based on previous in vitro characterization of cytokine responses. methods: a total of 62 volunteers participated in this randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled parallel group intervention study. the volunteers were randomized to receive a milk-based drink containing either lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg), bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb12 (bb12), or propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js (pjs) or a placebo  drink for 3 wk. venous blood and saliva samples were taken at baseline and on d 1, 7 and 21. fecal samples were collected at baseline and at the end of intervention. results: the serum hscrp expressed as the median auc(0-21) (minus baseline) was 0.018 mg/l in the placebo group, -0.240 mg/l in the lgg group, 0.090 mg/l in the bb12 group and -0.085 mg/l in the pjs group (p = 0.014). in vitro production of tnf-alpha from in vitro cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) was significantly lower in subjects receiving lgg vs placebo. il-2 production from pbmc in the bb12 group was significantly lower compared with the  other groups. conclusion: in conclusion, probiotic bacteria have strain-specific  anti-inflammatory effects in healthy adults.

TI  == clinical trial: multispecies probiotic supplementation alleviates the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and stabilizes intestinal microbiota.
AB  == background: irritable bowel syndrome is the most common diagnosis in gastroenterology. trials suggest certain probiotics to be beneficial. aim: to investigate the effects of multispecies probiotic supplementation (lactobacillus  rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js and bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb12) on abdominal symptoms, quality  of life, intestinal microbiota and inflammatory markers in irritable bowel syndrome. methods: eighty-six irritable bowel syndrome patients (rome ii criteria) participated in this randomized, placebo-controlled 5-month intervention. patients were randomized to receive daily either multispecies probiotic supplementation or placebo. irritable bowel syndrome symptoms, quality  of life, microarray-based intestinal microbiota stability (n = 20), serum cytokines and sensitive c-reactive protein were monitored. results: the composite irritable bowel syndrome score had at 5 months decreased 14 points (95% ci: -19 to -9) from baseline with the multispecies probiotic vs. three points (95% ci: -8 to 1) with placebo (p = 0.0083). especially, distension and abdominal pain were affected. a stabilization of the microbiota was observed, as the microbiota similarity index increased with the probiotic supplementation (1.9 +/- 3.1), while it decreased with placebo (-2.9 +/- 1.7). no differences were seen in c-reactive protein. conclusions: this multispecies probiotic seems to be an effective and safe option to alleviate symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, and  to stabilize the intestinal microbiota.
