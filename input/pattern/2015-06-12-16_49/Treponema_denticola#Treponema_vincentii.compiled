TI  - Association of treponeme species with atypical foot lesions in goats.
AB  - Five UK goat farms with high levels of lameness (prevalence 14-67 per cent) were  investigated. On two farms (farms 1 and 2), the animals presented with typical footrot lesions. The remaining three farms (farms 3, 4 and 5) presented with infected lesions on the foot that did not resemble footrot. These lesions were observed to start from the white line or sole but the interdigital space was rarely affected. Swabs were processed by PCR to assess the presence of Dichelobacter nodosus and three specific treponeme groups (group 1: Treponema medium/Treponema vincentii-like, group 2: Treponema phagedenis-like and group 3: Treponema denticola/Treponema putidum-like) that are reported to be associated with bovine digital dermatitis and contagious ovine digital dermatitis. On farms 1 and 2, 85.7 per cent of samples were found to be positive for D nodosus while only 9.5 per cent were positive for treponeme groups 1, 2 and 3. In contrast, 5.3 per cent of samples from farms 3, 4 and 5 were positive for D nodosus, while 34.2, 68.4 and 36.8 per cent of samples from these farms tested positive for treponeme groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. T medium/T vincentii-like, T phagedenis-like and T denticola/T putidum-like treponemes were detected on foot lesions of lame goats suggesting that they have a role in the aetiology of this lameness, which has not previously been described in dairy goats.
TI  - Presence of digital dermatitis treponemes on cattle and sheep hoof trimming equipment.
AB  - Digital dermatitis (DD) is an infectious foot disease causing severe lameness in  dairy cattle (worldwide) and sheep (UK). This study investigated whether DD Treponema phylogroups can be present on equipment used to trim ruminant hooves and, therefore, consider this trimming equipment as a possible vector for the transmission of DD. Equipment was tested after being used to trim DD symptomatic and asymptomatic cattle and sheep hooves, and subsequently after disinfection of equipment. After trimming, 'Treponema medium/Treponema vincentii-like', 'Treponema phagedenis-like' and 'Treponema denticola/T putidum-like' DD spirochaetes, were shown to be present on 23/37 (62%), 21/37 (57%) and 20/37 (54%) of knives, respectively. After disinfection, detection rates for the DD treponemes were 9/37 (24%), 6/37 (16%) and 3/37 (8%), respectively. Following culture of a swab, an isolate belonging to the T phagedenis-like spirochaetes was identified from a knife sample after trimming a DD positive cow. No isolates were obtained from knife samples after disinfection. This new data has, for the first time, identified treponemes in the farm environment, and highlighted disinfection of hoof trimming equipment between animals and between farms, as a logical precaution to limit the spread of DD.
TI  - Analysis of the complement sensitivity of oral treponemes and the potential influence of FH binding, FH cleavage and dentilisin activity on the pathogenesis of periodontal disease.
AB  - Treponema denticola, a periopathogen, evades complement-mediated killing by binding the negative complement regulatory protein factor H (FH) to its surface via the FhbB protein. Paradoxically, bound FH is cleaved by T. denticola's dentilisin protease, a process hypothesized to trigger localized dysregulation of complement activation in periodontal pockets. The ability of other oral treponemes to evade complement-mediated killing and bind and cleave FH has not been assessed. In this report, we demonstrate that representative isolates of Treponema socranskii, Treponema medium, Treponema pectinovorum and Treponema maltophilum are also serum resistant, whereas Treponema vincentii and Treponema amylovorum are serum sensitive. Although T. denticola's ability to evade complement-mediated killing is strictly dependent on FH binding, other serum-resistant treponemal species lack FhbB and do not bind FH, indicating an FH-independent mechanism of complement evasion. To assess the influence of FhbB sequence variation on FH binding and cleavage by T. denticola, fhbB sequences were determined for 30 isolates. Three distinct phyletic types were identified. All T. denticola strains bound FH and were serum resistant, but differences in binding kinetics, dentilisin activity and FH cleavage ability were observed. Based on these analyses, we hypothesize that the composition of the T. denticola population is a determining factor that influences the progression and severity of periodontal disease.
TI  - Targeting the treponemal microbiome of digital dermatitis infections by high-resolution phylogenetic analyses and comparison with fluorescent in situ hybridization.
AB  - Modern pyrosequencing technology allows for a more comprehensive approach than traditional Sanger sequencing for elucidating the etiology of bovine digital dermatitis. We sought to describe the composition and diversity of treponemes in digital dermatitis lesions by using deep sequencing of the V3 and V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene coupled with species-level taxonomic identification. Treponema-specific 16S rRNA gene PCRs and pyrosequencing were performed on biopsy specimens originating from 10 different Catalan dairy herds (n = 36) with digital dermatitis, and this analysis yielded 75,297 sequences. We identified 20 different taxa, including a potentially novel phylotype that displayed 95% sequence identity to members of the Treponema denticola/Treponema pedis-like cluster. Species frequencies and abundances that were determined by pyrosequencing analysis were highly correlated with the results of fluorescent in situ hybridization using phylotype-specific oligonucleotide probes. In a limited number of animals from a single geographic region, we detected most of the Treponema phylotypes that were described in previous investigations of digital dermatitis. Additionally, we identified a number of phylotypes that mapped to oral treponemes of humans and dogs that had not been reported for digital dermatitis lesions. The results presented here support previous observations of a polytreponemal etiology of infections, with Treponema phagedenis-like, Treponema medium/Treponema vincentii-like, and T. denticola/T. pedis-like phylotypes being highly associated with disease. Using this new approach, it has become feasible to study large herds and their surrounding environments, which might provide a basis for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease.
TI  - Multilocus sequence analysis of Treponema denticola strains of diverse origin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The oral spirochete bacterium Treponema denticola is associated with  both the incidence and severity of periodontal disease. Although the biological or phenotypic properties of a significant number of T. denticola isolates have been reported in the literature, their genetic diversity or phylogeny has never been systematically investigated. Here, we describe a multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) of 20 of the most highly studied reference strains and clinical isolates of T. denticola; which were originally isolated from subgingival plaque samples taken from subjects from China, Japan, the Netherlands, Canada and the USA. RESULTS: The sequences of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene, and 7 conserved protein-encoding genes (flaA, recA, pyrH, ppnK, dnaN, era and radC) were successfully determined for each strain. Sequence data was analyzed using a variety of bioinformatic and phylogenetic software tools. We found no evidence of positive selection or DNA recombination within the protein-encoding genes, where levels of intraspecific sequence polymorphism varied from 18.8% (flaA) to 8.9% (dnaN). Phylogenetic analysis of the concatenated protein-encoding gene sequence data (ca. 6,513 nucleotides for each strain) using Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches indicated that the T. denticola strains were monophyletic, and formed 6 well-defined clades. All analyzed T. denticola strains appeared to have a genetic origin distinct from that of 'Treponema vincentii' or Treponema pallidum. No specific geographical relationships could be established; but several strains isolated from different continents appear to be closely related at the genetic level. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses indicate that previous biological and biophysical investigations have predominantly focused on a subset of T. denticola strains with a relatively narrow range of genetic diversity. Our methodology and results establish a genetic framework for the discrimination and phylogenetic analysis of T. denticola isolates, which will greatly assist future biological and epidemiological investigations involving this putative 'periodontopathogen'.
TI  - Identification of four Treponema species in subgingival samples by nested-PCR and their correlation with clinical diagnosis.
AB  - The relationship between different species of oral Treponemas and inflammation in periodontal disease progression is complex. The purpose of this study was to analyze and compare the subgingival plaque samples collected from periodontally healthy subjects and from chronic gingivitis and periodontitis patients in order to detect the presence of T. denticola, T. pectinovorum, T. socranskii and T. vincentii using nested-PCR technology. After DNA extraction from the samples using QIAmp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, the four Treponema species were determined with nested-polymerase chain reaction which requires two sets of primers to amplify a specific DNA fragment in two separate runs of PCR. Pearson chi-square was implemented to compare the three groups as to the presence of four Treponema species. Results of this investigation showed significant differences between groups regarding subject proportion of T. denticola, T. socranskii, T. pectinovorum, T. vincentii, with a higher percentage of patients from associated-disease groups of patients harboring these four species than healthy subjects. These differences were more pronounced in presence of Treponema denticola and Treponema socranskii. Our findings suggest that Treponema denticola and Treponema socranskii concurrent presence indicate more accurately the association with chronic gingivitis and periodontitis.
TI  - Microbial shifts during dental biofilm re-development in the absence of oral hygiene in periodontal health and disease.
AB  - AIM: To monitor microbial shifts during dental biofilm re-development. MATERIALS  AND METHODS: Supra- and subgingival plaque samples were taken separately from 28 teeth in 38 healthy and 17 periodontitis subjects at baseline and immediately after tooth cleaning. Samples were taken again from seven teeth in randomly selected quadrants during 1, 2, 4 and 7 days of no oral hygiene. Samples were analysed using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Species counts were averaged within subjects at each time point. Significant differences in the counts between healthy and periodontitis subjects were determined using the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: The total supra- and subgingival counts were significantly higher in periodontitis on entry and reached or exceeded the baseline values after day 2. Supragingival counts of Veillonella parvula, Fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii and Neisseria mucosa increased from 2 to 7 days. Subgingival counts were greater for Actinomyces, green and orange complex species. Significant differences between groups in supragingival counts occurred for 17 of 41 species at entry, 0 at day 7; for subgingival plaque, these values were 39/41 taxa at entry, 17/41 at day 7. CONCLUSIONS: Supragingival plaque re-development was similar in periodontitis and health, but subgingival species recolonization was more marked in periodontitis.
TI  - Treponema species detected in infected root canals and acute apical abscess exudates.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Different microbial communities have been associated with acute endodontic infections. The majority of the microorganisms are as yet uncultivable or difficult to grow under current laboratory conditions. Treponema species are strict anaerobic bacteria that are involved in several oral diseases. The aim of this study was to detect the presence of Treponema species in infected root canals (RCs) and exudates related to acute apical abscesses (AAAs) as well as to determine positive association between targeted species and clinical signs/symptoms. METHODS: Paired samples of infected RCs and AAAs were collected from 20 subjects. Nested polymerase chain reaction assay with species-specific primers for 16S rDNA and downstream intergenic spacer region was used for microbial detection. The frequency of species and statistical associations between species and signs/symptoms of endodontic origin as well as their simultaneous detection in both milieus were investigated. RESULTS: The most frequently detected species were T. socranskii (RC, 17/20; AAA, 15/20), T. denticola (RC, 8/20; AAA, 11/20); T. medium (RC, 6/20; AAA, 9/20); and T. amylovorum (RC, 5/20; AAA, 9/20). Positive correlation was found for simultaneous presence of T. denticola in both RCs and AAAs (p = 0.01). Positive association was observed between T. medium and T. vincentii (p = .037). No positive statistical association was observed between the targeted species and signs/symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The high incidence of Treponema species in RC and AAA samples from the same tooth indicated that they are important pathogens in acute endodontic infections.
TI  - Identification of spirochetes associated with contagious ovine digital dermatitis.
AB  - Spirochetes of the genus Treponema were cultured from 7 of 10 cases of digital dermatitis in sheep. Two cultures comprised Treponema phagedenis-like and Treponema medium/Treponema vincentii-like spirochetes, respectively, while the remaining cultures comprised mixed populations of Treponema medium/Treponema vincentii-like, Treponema phagedenis-like, and Treponema denticola/Treponema putidum-like organisms.
TI  - Association of unique, isolated treponemes with bovine digital dermatitis lesions.
AB  - This study used a PCR-based approach targeting 16S rRNA gene fragments to determine the occurrence and association of the three bovine digital dermatitis (BDD) treponeme phylogroups within lesions found in cattle from the United Kingdom. Examination of 51 BDD lesions collected from infected cattle across the United Kingdom revealed that BDD treponeme group 1 (Treponema medium/Treponema vincentii-like), group 2 (Treponema phagedenis-like), and group 3 (Treponema putidum/Treponema denticola-like) were present in 96.1%, 98%, and 76.5% of BDD lesions, respectively. The three phylogroups were present together in 74.5% of lesions. The PCR assays enabled the isolation of further treponeme strains from previously mixed primary BDD lesion cultures. Here a representative from each of the three distinct treponeme phylogroups was isolated from a single BDD lesion for the first time. These data highlight the extent to which this disease is polytreponemal. Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy were used to investigate lesional hoof tissues, resulting in treponemes being identified copiously in hair follicles and sebaceous glands, suggesting a potential route of exit and/or entry for these pathogens. This study gives further evidence for the importance of the three treponeme groups in BDD pathogenesis and reiterates the value of molecular genetic approaches for isolating and identifying fastidious anaerobes.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of bovine digital dermatitis associated spirochaetes to antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Bovine digital dermatitis (BDD) is an infectious lameness in cattle, which has a  large global impact in terms of animal welfare and cost. The majority of evidence suggests that spirochaetes are the aetiological agent of this disease. The aim of this study was to identify the susceptibility of BDD associated spirochaetes to a range of antimicrobial agents with a view to potential usage in vivo to treat this widespread cattle disease. A microdilution method was adapted to determine the in vitro susceptibilities of 19 UK digital dermatitis spirochaetes (6 Treponema medium/Treponema vincentii-like, 8 Treponema phagedenis-like and 5 Treponema denticola/Treponema putidum-like) to eight relevant antimicrobials. The BDD spirochaetes exhibited the highest susceptibility to penicillin and erythromycin and this information may now be used to aid development of efficacious treatments. This study has also identified that BDD spirochaete T167 is spectinomycin resistant and that the likely biological basis is a point mutation in the 16S rRNA gene. Interestingly, nearly all Brachyspira isolate 16S rRNA gene sequences in Genbank have this substitution, suggesting it may be responsible for the characteristic spectinomycin resistance reported for the Brachyspira genus.
TI  - Evidence of multiple Treponema phylotypes involved in bovine digital dermatitis as shown by 16S rRNA gene analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization.
AB  - The etiopathogenesis of the skin disease digital dermatitis (DD), an important cause of lameness in cattle, remains uncertain. Microscopically, the disease appears to be polymicrobial, with spirochetes as the predominant bacteria. The objective of this study was to identify the main part of the bacteria involved in DD lesions of cattle by using culture-independent molecular methods. Ten different phylotypes of Treponema were identified either by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of bacteria from DD lesions or by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis using phylotype-specific 16S rRNA-directed oligonucleotide probes. Two phylotypes, phylotype 1 (PT1) and PT2, were not closely related to any characterized treponemal species. PT7 was 99.3% identical to Treponema denticola, while PT9 resembled T. vincentii by 96%. The remaining phylotypes, PT3, PT4, PT5, PT6, and PT8, and Treponema brennaborense had previously been isolated from DD lesions. Forty DD biopsy specimens were examined for Treponema by FISH. With one exception, all of the biopsy specimens revealed epidermotropic, intermingled infection with three or more different phylotypes (mean, 4.7). The most prevalent species were PT1 (95%), PT6 (93%), and PT3 (85%). While colonization by PT3 was confined to the surface of the epidermis, both PT1 and PT6 invaded deep into the stratum spinosum and were seen in ulcerated dermal papillae. In two cases, all 10 phylotypes were demonstrated. Furthermore, FISH with a Treponema group-specific probe showed that Treponema accounted for more than 90% of the total bacterial population in the biopsy specimens. These data strongly suggest that a group of apparently symbiotic Treponema species are involved as primary bacterial pathogens in DD.
TI  - Three unique groups of spirochetes isolated from digital dermatitis lesions in UK cattle.
AB  - Bovine digital dermatitis (BDD) is a severe infectious cause of lameness which has spread through dairy cattle populations worldwide, causing serious welfare and agricultural problems. Spirochetes are the main organisms implicated and have previously proven difficult to isolate. This study aimed to isolate and characterise the range of spirochetes associated with BDD in the UK. Twenty-three spirochete isolates were obtained from 30 BDD lesions, which by 16S rRNA gene and flaB2 gene analysis clustered within the genus Treponema as three phylogroups; groups 1 (Treponema medium/Treponema vincentii-like), 2 (Treponema phagedenis-like) and 3 (Treponema denticola/Treponema putidum-like). The treponemes displayed large genotypic and phenotypic diversity between phylogroups and differed from named treponeme species. A previously isolated contagious ovine digital dermatitis spirochete was located within one of the three phylogroups, group 3, and could also be identified within this group on the basis of phenotype testing, suggesting BDD and contagious ovine digital dermatitis may share the same aetiological agent. A strain isolated from a bovine interdigital dermatitis lesion, could be identified as part of BDD isolate group 2, suggesting bovine interdigital dermatitis and BDD may have the same causative agent. Two common enzyme activities, C4 esterase and C8 esterase lipase, were identified in all BDD associated treponemes suggesting common metabolic pathways for sharing this novel niche or even common virulence traits. Further studies are required to determine whether the three groups of novel treponemes are representative of new treponeme taxa and to delineate how they interact with bovine tissues to cause disease.
TI  - Association of Eubacterium nodatum and Treponema denticola with human periodontitis lesions.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present investigation was to compare the levels, proportions and percentage of sites colonized by 40 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples from periodontally healthy subjects and patients with chronic periodontitis to seek possible pathogens other than the consensus pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia. METHOD: Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 635 subjects with chronic periodontitis and 189 periodontally healthy subjects. The samples were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (total samples = 21,832). Mean counts, % DNA probe counts and percentage of sites colonized at >10(5) were determined for each species in each subject and then averaged in each clinical group. Significance of difference between groups was determined using the Mann-Whitney test. Association between combinations of species and periodontal status was examined by stepwise logistic regression analysis. Analyses were repeated using a subset of subjects from both clinical groups who had proportions of P. gingivalis plus T. forsythia less than the median (4.42%) found in periodontally healthy subjects. All analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: For the 824 subjects the consensus pathogens P. gingivalis and T. forsythia as well as Eubacterium nodatum and Treponema denticola had significantly higher mean counts, proportions and percentage of sites colonized in samples from subjects with periodontitis than from periodontally healthy subjects. There were significantly more Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Streptococcus gordonii and Veillonella parvula in periodontally healthy subjects. E. nodatum, T. denticola, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii all had higher counts and proportions in diseased than healthy subjects who had low proportions of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia. Logistic regression analysis indicated that the same species groups were associated with disease status after adjusting for the proportions of the other species. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation confirmed the strong association of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia with chronic periodontitis and emphasized a strong association of E. nodatum and T. denticola with periodontitis whether in the presence or absence of high levels of the consensus pathogens. Other species, including S. oralis, Eikenella corrodens, S. intermedius and F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, were associated with disease when P. gingivalis and T. forsythia were present in low proportions.
TI  - Resistance to human beta-defensins is common among oral treponemes.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Oral treponemes are implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. We have previously shown that Treponema denticola ATCC type strains and strain GM-1 are resistant to killing by human beta-defensins (hbetaD)-1 and -2. We hypothesize that resistance to beta-defensins is a common feature of oral treponemes, which allows colonization and persistence in the oral cavity. In this study, we tested additional isolates of T. denticola, as well as six other species of treponemes, for resistance to hbetaD-1, -2 and -3. We also examined the four ATCC strains of T. denticola and strain GM-1 for resistance to hbetaD-3. METHODS: Resistance was determined by motility and Alamar Blue assays for metabolic activity. RESULTS: All T. denticola strains tested were resistant to hbetaD-1, -2 and -3, with the exception of strain Ambigua, which was sensitive to hbetaD-2 and -3. All other treponemes except Treponema vincentii were resistant to hbetaD-1. Treponema pectinovorum was sensitive to hbetaD-2, while T. vincentii, T. pectinovorum and Treponema maltophilum were sensitive to hbetaD-3. Escherichia coli was used as a control organism and was killed by all three defensins. CONCLUSION: Resistance to the constitutively expressed hbetaD-1 may assist treponemes in initial colonization of epithelial surfaces, while resistance to the inducible hbetaD-2 and -3 would allow some treponemes to survive in active periodontal lesions.
TI  - Treponema species associated with abscesses of endodontic origin.
AB  - Spirochetes have been frequently observed in abscesses of endodontic origin, but  they have rarely been identified. This study sought to investigate the prevalence of eight oral treponemes in acute periradicular abscesses using a species-specific nested polymerase chain reaction assay. Purulent exudate was collected by aspiration from 19 cases diagnosed as acute periradicular abscesses and DNA extracted from the samples was initially amplified using universal 16S rDNA primers. A second round of amplification used the first polymerase chain reaction products to detect a specific fragment of the 16S rDNA of each Treponema species. The species-specific nPCR assay used in this study allowed the detection of Treponema denticola in 79%(15 of 19), Treponema socranskii in 26%(5 of 19), Treponema pectinovorum in 21% (4 of 19), Treponema amylovorum in 16% (3 of 19), and Treponema medium in 5% (1 of 19) of the cases. Spirochetal DNA was found in 89% of the cases (17 of 19). The number of Treponema species per case ranged from 1 to 3 (mean, 1.5). Treponema vincentii, Treponema lecithinolyticum and Treponema maltophilum were not detected in any pus sample. The present data lend support to the assertion that Treponema species, particularly T. denticola and T. socranskii, may be involved in the pathogenesis of acute periradicular abscesses.
TI  - Intraoral dissemination of treponemes after periodontal therapy.
AB  - Oral treponemes are related to chronic periodontitis, but the effect of periodontal therapy on the majority of treponemal species is unknown. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the dynamics in prevalence profiles of treponemes in different habitats of the oral cavity. Thirty-five patients with chronic periodontitis were randomly assigned to mechanical debridement alone (control group) or systemic amoxicillin/metronidazole plus chlorhexidine (test group). Subgingival and mucous membrane plaque samples were taken at baseline, after 10 days, and during supportive periodontal therapy at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months. T. denticola, T. lecithinolyticum, T. maltophilum, T. socranskii, T. vincentii, and treponemal phylotypes I-VII were detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and dot blot analysis. For the majority of the assessed treponemes, a significant intragroup increase in prevalence in the different habitats ( P<0.05) occurred over the study course but, compared to debridement alone, adjunctive antimicrobial therapy resulted in a nonsignificant trend toward lower prevalence in the subgingival habitat. In no case were treponemes eradicated from the oral cavity. After both therapies, possibly new infection with and/or dissemination of Treponema ssp. occurred, which led to treponemes recovering in different habitats and to increased intraoral prevalence. The prescribed adjunctive antimicrobial therapy may limit this increase in the subgingival region.
TI  - Relationship between periodontal pocket sulfide levels and subgingival species.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many species implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSC). This investigation examined the relationship between levels of sulfide and subgingival bacterial species in the same periodontal pockets. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty chronic periodontitis subjects were measured clinically at six sites per tooth for plaque, gingivitis, bleeding on probing, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment level. Subgingival plaque samples, taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth, were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Sulfide levels were measured at the same sites using a Diamond Probe/Perio 2000 system. Clinical and microbiological data were averaged for sulfide-positive and -negative sites separately in each subject and then averaged across subjects. Significance differences in clinical and microbial parameters between sulfide-positive and -negative sites were sought using the Wilcoxon signed ranks test. RESULTS: Mean total DNA probe counts (x10(5), +/-SEM) at sulfide-negative and -positive sites were 44.0 +/- 9.9 and 65.0 +/- 13.3, respectively (p < 0.01). Seventeen species were found at significantly higher levels in sulfide-positive than -negative sites. These included abundant producers of VSC such as members of the genera Fusobacterium, Campylobacter, Prevotella, Treponema and Eubacterium, and Bacteriodes forsythus, Selenomonas noxia and Propionibacterium acnes. Prevotella intermedia, Bacteriodes forsythus, Prevotella nigrescens, Fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii and Treponema denticola exhibited the greatest difference in mean counts between sulfide-negative and -positive sites. Orange and red complex species were at higher counts at shallow (< 4 mm) sulfide-positive than shallow sulfide-negative sites. Although not statistically significant, mean clinical parameters were somewhat higher at sulfide-positive than sulfide-negative sites. CONCLUSIONS: Intra-pocket sulfide levels reflect the levels of sulfide-producing species and may provide useful diagnostic information.
TI  - Identification of spirochetes (treponemes) in endodontic infections.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of spirochetes in asymptomatic infected root canals and in endodontic abscesses/cellulitis. Aseptic clinical samples were collected using paper points from 54 infected root canals and from aspirates of 84 abscesses/cellulitis. Oligonucleotide primers were produced for PCR identification of Treponema vincentii, T. pectinovorum, T. medium, T. amylovorum, T. denticola, T. maltophilum, and T. socranskii. PCR detected spirochetes in 51 of 84 (60.7%) samples from abscesses/cellulitis and in 20 of 54 (37.0%) samples from asymptomatic infected root canals. T. socranskii was the most frequently detected (44.9%), followed by T. maltophilum (29.7%), T. denticola (28.9%), T. pectinovorum (13.7%), and T. vincentii (5.1%). The number of treponema species detected ranged from 1 to 5 species per sample. The mean numbers of species detected were 2.3 in abscesses/cellulitis and 2.6 in infected root canals. Significant association among species was found between T. maltophilum and T. socranskii, as well as between T. maltophilum and T. denticola by determining the odds ratio (> 2.0).
TI  - Two paralogous families of a two-gene subtilisin operon are widely distributed in oral treponemes.
AB  - Certain oral treponemes express a highly proteolytic phenotype and have been associated with periodontal diseases. The periodontal pathogen Treponema denticola produces dentilisin, a serine protease of the subtilisin family. The two-gene operon prcA-prtP is required for expression of active dentilisin (PrtP), a putative lipoprotein attached to the treponeme's outer membrane or sheath. The purpose of this study was to examine the diversity and structure of treponemal subtilisin-like proteases in order to better understand their distribution and function. The complete sequences of five prcA-prtP operons were determined for Treponema lecithinolyticum, "Treponema vincentii," and two canine species. Partial operon sequences were obtained for T. socranskii subsp. 04 as well as 450- to 1,000-base fragments of prtP genes from four additional treponeme strains. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the sequences fall into two paralogous families. The first family includes the sequence from T. denticola. Treponemes possessing this operon family express chymotrypsin-like protease activity and can cleave the substrate N-succinyl-alanyl-alanyl-prolyl-phenylalanine-p-nitroanilide (SAAPFNA). Treponemes possessing the second paralog family do not possess chymotrypsin-like activity or cleave SAAPFNA. Despite examination of a range of protein and peptide substrates, the specificity of the second protease family remains unknown. Each of the fully sequenced prcA and prtP genes contains a 5' hydrophobic leader sequence with a treponeme lipobox. The two paralogous families of treponeme subtilisins represent a new subgroup within the subtilisin family of proteases and are the only subtilisin lipoprotein family. The present study demonstrated that the subtilisin paralogs comprising a two-gene operon are widely distributed among treponemes.
TI  - Positive and negative bacterial associations involving Dialister pneumosintes in  primary endodontic infections.
AB  - Dialister pneumosintes is an anaerobic Gram-negative rod that has been recently implicated as a candidate endodontic pathogen. In this study, samples taken from abscessed teeth and infected root canals associated with asymptomatic or symptomatic periradicular lesions were examined for the occurrence of bacterial associations involving D. pneumosintes. DNA was extracted from the samples, and the presence of D. pneumosintes and 16 other bacterial species was determined by means of species-specific nested polymerase chain reaction. Positive and negative associations involving D. pneumosintes were investigated by computing the odds ratio of D. pneumosintes being found in a sample from endodontic infection in co-infection with one of the other target species. The association between the pairs containing D. pneumosintes and the occurrence of pain also was evaluated. D. pneumosintes was always detected in mixed infections with at least two of the other target species. D. pneumosintes was positively associated with Treponema denticola, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia, T. pectinovorum, and T. vincentii. Negative associations were observed with Bacteroides forsythus, P. gingivalis, and Actinomyces israelii. No pair containing D. pneumosintes was found to be significantly associated with symptomatic cases (p > 0.01). The findings of this study lend considerable support to the notion of D. pneumosintes being an important endodontic pathogen, usually in a mixed infection. Positive associations of this species with other highly prevalent species, such as T. denticola and P. endodontalis, suggest that bacterial synergism can occur and thereby play an important role in the pathogenesis of different forms of periradicular lesions.
TI  - Genetic relatedness and phenotypic characteristics of Treponema associated with human periodontal tissues and ruminant foot disease.
AB  - Treponema have been implicated recently in the pathogenesis of digital dermatitis (DD) and contagious ovine digital dermatitis (CODD) that are infectious diseases of bovine and ovine foot tissues, respectively. Previous analyses of treponemal 16S rDNA sequences, PCR-amplified directly from DD or CODD lesions, have suggested relatedness of animal Treponema to some human oral Treponema species isolated from periodontal tissues. In this study a range of adhesion and virulence-related properties of three animal Treponema isolates have been compared with representative human oral strains of Treponema denticola and Treponema vincentii. In adhesion assays using biotinylated treponemal cells, T. denticola cells bound in consistently higher numbers to fibronectin, laminin, collagen type I, gelatin, keratin and lactoferrin than did T. vincentii or animal Treponema isolates. However, animal DD strains adhered to fibrinogen at equivalent or greater levels than T. denticola. All Treponema strains bound to the amino-terminal heparin I/fibrin I domain of fibronectin. 16S rDNA sequence analyses placed ovine strain UB1090 and bovine strain UB1467 within a cluster that was phylogenetically related to T. vincentii, while ovine strain UB1466 appeared more closely related to T. denticola. These observations correlated with phenotypic properties. Thus, T. denticola ATCC 35405, GM-1, and Treponema UB1466 had similar outer-membrane protein profiles, produced chymotrypsin-like protease (CTLP), trypsin-like protease and high levels of proline iminopeptidase, and co-aggregated with human oral bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis and Streptococcus crista. Conversely, T. vincentii ATCC 35580, D2A-2, and animal strains UB1090 and UB1467 did not express CTLP or trypsin-like protease and did not co-aggregate with P. gingivalis or S. crista. Taken collectively, these results suggest that human oral-related Treponema have broad host specificity and that similar control or preventive strategies might be developed for human and animal Treponema-associated infections.
TI  - Oral treponemes in primary root canal infections as detected by nested PCR.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the prevalences of four Treponema species in primary root canal infections using a nested PCR assay. METHODOLOGY: Samples were obtained from 32 infected root canals. Twenty-two cases showed chronic asymptomatic periradicular lesions and 10 symptomatic cases were diagnosed as acute apical periodontitis. DNA extracted from the samples was initially amplified using universal 16S rDNA primers. A second round of amplification used the first PCR products to detect a specific fragment of the 16S rDNA of each Treponema denticola, T. socranskii, T. vincentii and T. pectinovorum. RESULTS: Bacteria were present in all cases sampled. T. denticola was detected in 77.3% of the asymptomatic cases, T. socranskii in 40.9%, T. vincentii in 18.2% and T. pectinovorum in 13.6%. In the cases diagnosed as acute apical periodontitis, T. denticola was detected in 80%, whilst T. socranskii and T. vincentii were detected in 40% and 10% of cases, respectively. No symptomatic case yielded T. pectinovorum. In general, nested PCR detected T. denticola in 78.1% of the cases, T. socranskii in 40.6%, T. vincentii in 15.6% and T. pectinovorum in 9.4%. At least one of the four Treponema species was found in 84.4% of the cases examined. CONCLUSIONS: The species T. denticola was detected in a large number of the cases examined: the prevalence of T. socranskii was also relatively high. The species T. vincentii and T. pectinovorum were also found, but in a smaller number of cases. Based on these data, the recognized pathogenicity of these microorganisms and their involvement with other oral diseases, they should be included in the restricted set of putative endodontic pathogens.
TI  - Amended biochemical characteristics and phylogenetic position of Treponema medium.
AB  - Umemoto et al. (1997, Int J Syst Bacteriol 47, pp. 67-72) proposed spirochete strain G7201, isolated from the periodontal pocket of an adult patient, as a new species, Treponema medium. They deposited this strain in the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) as type strain ATCC 700293T. Recently, ATCC suggested that there is a discrepancy between the previous report and the results obtained by ATCC in biochemical tests on T. medium ATCC 700293T. In this study, we re-examined and verified the biochemical characteristics of T. medium. The fermentation pattern of carbohydrates of T. medium resembled that of Treponema vincentii and Treponema denticola, but T. medium was clearly differentiated from T. vincentii in the production of indole, and from T. denticola in the hydrolysis of esculin. Also, sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) protein profile analysis and phylogenetic comparison of 16S rDNA sequences revealed that T. medium is clearly differentiated from any established treponemal species, which supports the validity of the proposal of Treponema medium as a new species.
TI  - Oral treponemes and their outer membrane extracts activate human gingival epithelial cells through toll-like receptor 2.
AB  - Oral treponemes are considered to be important in the development and progression of periodontal diseases. We investigated the mechanisms of recognition and activation of human gingival epithelial cells (HGEC) with the oral treponemes Treponema denticola, Treponema vincentii, and Treponema medium and their outer membrane extracts (OMEs). T. vincentii and T. medium but not T. denticola produced interleukin 8 (IL-8) in an HGEC culture. Further, all three treponemes induced IL-8 mRNA expression and NF-kappaB activation in HGEC. Among them, T. denticola especially exhibited trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like protease activities, and the addition of chymostatin, a chymotrypsin protease inhibitor, resulted in detectable IL-8 production by HGEC cultured with T. denticola. Additionally, IL-8 mRNA expression in HGEC cultured with the three treponemes and their OMEs was definitely inhibited by the mouse anti-human Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) monoclonal antibody TL2.1. These findings suggest that oral treponemes and their OMEs activate HGEC through TLR2.
TI  - Molecular typing of papillomatous digital dermatitis-associated Treponema isolates based on analysis of 16S-23S ribosomal DNA intergenic spacer regions.
AB  - Papillomatous digital dermatitis (PDD), an emerging infectious disease of cattle, is characterized by painful, ulcerative foot lesions. The detection of high numbers of invasive spirochetes in PDD lesions suggests an important role for these organisms in the pathogenesis of PDD. PDD-associated spirochetes have phenotypic characteristics consistent with members of the genus TREPONEMA: Partial 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequence analysis of clonal isolates from California cattle showed that they comprise three phylotypes which cluster closely with human-associated Treponema spp. of the oral cavity (T. denticola and T. medium/T. vincentii) or genital area (T. phagedenis). The goal of our study was to apply 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region (ISR) sequence analysis to the molecular typing of U.S. PDD-associated Treponema isolates. This methodology has potentially greater discriminatory power for differentiation of closely related bacteria than 16S rDNA analysis. We PCR amplified, cloned, and sequenced the ISRs from six California PDD-associated Treponema isolates and, for comparative purposes, one strain each of T. denticola, T. medium, T. vincentii, and T. phagedenis. Two ISRs that varied in length and composition were present in all the PDD-associated Treponema isolates and in T. denticola, T. medium, and T. phagedenis. ISR1 contained a tRNA(Ala) gene, while ISR2 contained a tRNA(Ile) gene. Only a single ISR (ISR1) was identified in T. vincentii. Comparative analyses of the ISR1 and ISR2 sequences indicated that the California PDD-associated Treponema isolates comprised three phylotypes, in agreement with the results of 16S rDNA analysis. PCR amplification of the 16S-tRNA(Ile) region of ISR2 permitted rapid phylotyping of California and Iowa PDD-associated Treponema isolates based on product length polymorphisms.
TI  - Detection and quantification of oral treponemes in subgingival plaque by real-time PCR.
AB  - Oral treponemes have been associated with periodontal diseases. We developed a highly sensitive and specific method to detect and quantify cultivable oral treponemes (Treponema denticola, Treponema vincentii, and Treponema medium) in 50 subgingival plaque samples from 13 healthy subjects as well as 37 patients with periodontal diseases using real-time PCR assays with specific primers and a TaqMan probe for each 16S rRNA sequence. The specificity for each assay was examined by using DNA specimens from various treponemal and other bacterial species. The TaqMan real-time PCR was able to detect from 10(3) to 10(8) cells of the oral treponemes, with correlation coefficients as follows: T. denticola, 0.984; T. vincentii, 0.991; and T. medium, 0.984. The frequencies of occurrence of these three oral treponemes in subgingival plaque samples were as follows: T. denticola, 68.0%; T. vincentii, 36.0%; and T. medium, 48.0%. In addition, the number of T. denticola, T. vincentii, and T. medium cells in plaque samples detected by real-time PCR ranged from 3 to 15,184, 1 to 447, and 1 to 7,301 cells/pg of plaque DNA, respectively. Increased numbers of T. denticola cells were detected in plaque samples from deep periodontal pockets, and T. medium was also detected in deep pockets. On the other hand, T. vincentii was mainly found in shallow pockets. These results suggest that various oral treponemes are associated with the formation of each stage of periodontal disease.
TI  - Microbial profile on metallic and ceramic bracket materials.
AB  - The placement of orthodontic appliances creates a favorable environment for the accumulation of a microbiota and food residues, which, in time, may cause caries or exacerbate any pre-existing periodontal disease. The purpose of the present study was to compare the total bacterial counts present on metallic and ceramic orthodontic brackets in order to clarify which bracket type has a higher plaque retaining capacity and to determine the levels of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus spp on both types of brackets. Thirty-two metallic brackets and 24 ceramic brackets were collected from orthodontic patients at the day of debonding. Two brackets were collected from each patient; one from a maxillary central incisor and another from a maxillary second premolar. Sixteen patients who used metallic brackets and 12 patients who used ceramic brackets were sampled. Bacterial populations were studied using "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridization, which uses DNA probes to identify species in complex microbial samples. The significance of differences between groups was determined using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Results showed no significant differences between metallic and ceramic brackets with respect to the caries-inducing S mutans and L acidophilus spp counts. Mean counts of 8 of 35 additional species differed significantly between metallic and ceramic brackets with no obvious pattern favoring one bracket type over the other. This study showed higher mean counts of Treponema denticola, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii, Streptococcus anginosus, and Eubacterium nodatum on metallic brackets while higher counts of Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter showae, and Selenomonas noxia were found on ceramic brackets.
TI  - Isolation of oral spirochetes from dogs and cats and provisional identification using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis specific for human plaque Treponema spp.
AB  - Identification of plaque spirochetes from dogs is rare and no studies to date report cultivation of canine or feline plaque spirochetes. Plaque samples obtained from canine and feline patients were cultured in broth media. Spirochetes cultured were subjected to microscopic evaluation and were cloned on a solid medium. The clones were provisionally identified using species-specific PCR for treponema isolated from human plaque. Canine spirochete clones included Treponema denticola, T. socranskii ssp., T. vincentii, T. maltophilum, T. medium, and T. pectinovorum. Feline clones included T. maltophilum and T. socranskii. Non-amplified clones may represent novel treponemes. Future studies will be aimed at comparison of the spirochetes present in dogs and cats with or without periodontal disease.
TI  - Chemotaxis of oral treponemes toward sera and albumin of rabbit.
AB  - The motility and chemotaxis of human oral spirochetes Treponema denticola ATCC 35404, T. medium ATCC 700293, and T. vincentii ATCC 35580 were examined by a capillary assay method. Of five sera three human oral treponemes were dominantly chemoattractant to the rabbit serum. The checkerboard analysis of chemotaxis toward rabbit serum clearly showed that the motile T. denticola cells swam toward the culture media containing higher concentrations of the rabbit serum. T. denticola chemotaxis to the rabbit serum was clearly reduced by heating serum, and rabbit albumin contributed by 60 to 70% to its chemotaxis to the rabbit serum. Western blotting analysis demonstrated that these treponemes possessed rabbit albumin-binding polypeptides with approximate molecular sizes of 65 kDa and 70 kDa. Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that a 65 kDa rabbit albumin-binding polypeptide was located on the outer envelopes, suggesting that the rabbit albumin-binding polypeptide is responsible for chemotaxis toward rabbit serum.
TI  - Relationship of cigarette smoking to the subgingival microbiota.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship of cigarette smoking to the composition of the subgingival microbiota is not clear. Some studies indicated higher levels of certain species in smokers, while other studies failed to detect differences in the microbiota between subjects with different smoking histories. Thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to examine the prevalence, proportions and levels of the subgingival species in adult subjects who were current, past or never smokers. METHOD: 272 adult subjects ranging in age from 20-86 years with at least 20 teeth were recruited for study. Smoking history was obtained using a questionnaire. Clinical measures were taken at 6 sites per tooth at all teeth excluding third molars at a baseline visit. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth excluding third molars in each subject at baseline and assayed individually for counts of 29 subgingival species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Subjects were subset according to smoking history into never (n=124), past (n=98) and current smokers (n=50). Uni-variate and multi-variate analyses were used to seek associations between smoking category and the counts, proportions and prevalence of subgingival species. RESULTS: Greater differences were observed for the prevalence (% of sites colonized) of the test species in the 3 smoking groups than were observed for counts or proportions of total counts. Members of the orange and red complexes including E. nodatum, F. nucleatum ss vincentii, P. intermedia, P. micros, P. nigrescens, B. forsythus, P. gingivalis and T. denticola were significantly more prevalent in current smokers than in the other 2 groups. The difference in prevalence between smokers and non-smokers was due to greater colonization at sites with pocket depth <4 mm. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis indicated that combinations of the prevalence of 5 microbial species and pack years accounted for 44% of the variance for mean pocket depth (p<0.000001), while the prevalence of 3 microbial taxa along with age, pack years, current smoking and gender accounted for 31% of the variance in mean attachment level (p<0.000001). The difference in prevalence between current and never smokers of all members of the red complex and 8 of 12 members of the orange complex was significantly greater in the maxilla than in the mandible. CONCLUSIONS: The major difference between the subgingival microbiota in subjects with different smoking history was in the prevalence of species rather than counts or proportions. The greater extent of colonization in smokers appeared to be due to greater colonization at pocket depths <4 mm. Differences in colonization patterns between current and never smokers were greater in the maxilla than in the mandible.
TI  - Taxonomy and virulence of oral spirochetes.
AB  - All oral spirochetes are classified in the genus Treponema. This genus is in the  family Spirochaetaceae as in Bergey's manual of systematic bacteriology. Other generic members of the family include Spirochaeta, Cristispira and Borrelia. This conventional classification is in accord with phylogenetic analysis of the spirochetes based on 16S rRNA cataloguing. The oral spirochetes fall naturally within the grouping of Treponema. Only four species of Treponema have been cultivated and maintained reliably: Treponema denticola, Treponema pectinovorum, Treponema socranskii and Treponema vincentii. These species have valid names according to the rules of nomenclature except for Treponema vincentii, which only has had effective publication. The virulence factors of the oral spirochetes updated in this mini-review have been discussed within the following broad confines: adherence, cytotoxic effects, iron sequestration and locomotion. T. denticola has been shown to attach to human gingival fibroblasts, basement membrane proteins, as well as other substrates by specific attachment mechanisms. The binding of the spirochete to human gingival fibroblasts resulted in cytotoxicity and cell death due to enzymes and other proteins. Binding of the spirochete to erythrocytes was accompanied by agglutination and lysis. Hemolysis releases hemin, which is sequestered by an outer membrane sheath receptor protein of the spirochete. The ability to locomote through viscous environments enables spirochetes to migrate within gingival crevicular fluid and to penetrate sulcular epithelial linings and gingival connective tissue. The virulence factors of the oral spirochetes proven in vitro underscore the important role they play in the periodontal disease process. This role has been evaluated in vivo by use of a murine model.
TI  - Identification of a Treponema denticola OppA homologue that binds host proteins present in the subgingival environment.
AB  - Proteins secreted or exported by Treponema denticola have been implicated as mediators of specific interactions between the spirochete and subgingival tissues in periodontal diseases. However, limited information is available on the ability of this peptidolytic organism to bind or transport soluble peptides present in the subgingival environment. A prominent 70-kDa protein was isolated from surface extracts of T. denticola ATCC 35405. A clone expressing a portion of the protein was identified in an Escherichia coli expression library of T. denticola DNA. DNA sequence analysis showed that the cloned gene encoded a peptide homologous to OppA, the solute binding protein of an ATP-binding cassette-type peptide transporter involved in peptide uptake and environmental signaling in a wide range of bacteria. Genes encoding OppB, -C, -D, and -F were identified directly downstream of oppA in T. denticola. OppA was present in representative strains of T. denticola and in Treponema vincentii but was not detected in Treponema pectinovorum or Treponema socranskii. Immunogold electron microscopy suggested that OppA was accessible to proteins at the surface of the spirochete. Native OppA bound soluble plasminogen and fibronectin but did not bind to immobilized substrates or epithelial cells. A T. denticola oppA mutant bound reduced amounts of soluble plasminogen, and plasminogen binding to the parent strain was inhibited by the lysine analog epsilon-aminocaproic acid. Binding of soluble host proteins by OppA may be important both for spirochete-host interactions in the subgingival environment and for uptake of peptide nutrients.
TI  - Pre- and post-implantation microbiota of the tongue, teeth, and newly placed implants.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This investigation sought intra-oral sources of species colonizing dental implants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plaque samples were taken pre- and post-successful osseointegration from implants, teeth, and from tongues of 10 edentulous and 11 partially dentate subjects. Samples were assayed using whole genomic DNA probes in a checkerboard assay to 42 subgingival species. RESULTS: Similar prevalences and mean levels (10(3) to 10(4)) of microorganisms colonized implants and teeth. Species levels from tongue samples were higher than those of teeth and implants, although species prevalence was similar, suggesting that larger samples were obtained from the tongue. No significant differences were observed between the microbiota from the tongue of edentulous and partially dentate subjects. Most implant species were detected on tongue pre-implantation. In individual edentulous subjects, there were positive associations between Capnocytophaga ochracea and Campylobacter rectus from tongue and implant samples. In individual partially dentate subjects, there were positive associations between Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. vincentii from tongue and implant samples, and Treponema denticola from implant and tooth samples taken at the same visit. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that the tongue, in addition to teeth, can be a source for species colonizing new implants.
TI  - Genetic and structural analyses of cytoplasmic filaments of wild-type Treponema phagedenis and a flagellar filament-deficient mutant.
AB  - Unique cytoplasmic filaments are found in the treponeme genus of spirochete bacteria. Their function is unknown, but their location underneath the periplasmic flagellar filaments (PFF) suggests a role in motility and/or cell structure. To better understand these unique structures, the gene coding for the cytoplasmic filaments, cfpA, was identified in various treponemal species. Treponema phagedenis cfpA was 2,037 nucleotides long, and the encoded polypeptide showed 78 to 100% amino acid sequence identity with the partial sequence of CfpA from T. denticola, T. vincentii, and T. pallidum subsp. pertenue. Wild-type T. phagedenis and a PFF-deficient isolate were analyzed by electron microscopy to assess the structural relationship of the cytoplasmic filaments and the PFF. The number of cytoplasmic filaments per cell of T. phagedenis (mean, 5.7) was compared with the number of PFF at each end of the cell (mean, 4.7); the results suggest that there is no direct one-to-one correlation at the cell end. Moreover, a structural link between these structures could not be demonstrated. The cytoplasmic filaments were also analyzed by electron microscopy at different stages of cell growth; this analysis revealed that they are cleaved before or during septum formation and before the nascent formation of PFF. A PFF-deficient mutant of T. phagedenis possessed cytoplasmic filaments similar to those of the wild type, suggesting that intact PFF are not required for their assembly and regulation. The extensive conservation of CfpA among pathogenic spirochetes suggests an important function, and structural analysis suggests that it is unlikely that the cytoplasmic filaments and the flagellar apparatus are physically linked.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of saccharolytic oral treponemes isolated from human subgingival plaque.
AB  - A total of 74 strains of oral treponemes, which were isolated from subgingival plaque samples from patients with periodontitis, were taxonomically studied on the basis of biochemical characteristics, DNA-DNA hybridization, and 16S rRNA gene sequences. These organisms fermented carbohydrates and required rumen fluid or short-chain volatile fatty acids for growth. The isolates were divided into seven subgroups based on their biochemical characteristics. The levels of DNA relatedness among the representative strains of each subgroup and Treponema socranskii (including three subspecies) were greater than 78%, while the levels of DNA relatedness among these strains and other Treponema species, including T. denticola and "T. vincentii", were less than 15%. DNA-DNA hybridization indicated that all subgroups belonged to T. socranskii. This result correlated well with the cluster on the phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA sequences.
TI  - Restriction fragment-length polymorphism analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA genes amplified by polymerase chain reaction for rapid identification of cultivable oral treponemes.
AB  - Although oral treponemes are among the most frequently found bacteria in periodontal pockets, identification of these organisms can be difficult. In this study, restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified 16S ribosomal RNA genes (16S rRNA gene PCR-RFLP) was used to generate restriction profiles of reference strains of oral treponemes including Treponema denticola, Treponema socranskii, Treponema vincentii. Treponema pectinovorum and Treponema medium as well as for Treponema phagedenis and Treponema pailidum and five treponeme strains isolated from human peridontal pockets. Before RFLP analysis, the 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained from the GenBank database, and the analysis of the theoretical banding patterns for HpaII suggested good species discrimination. 16S rRNA gene sequences were amplified from isolated genomic DNA samples by PCR with spirochete-specific primers. The PCR products were then purified and characterized by single digestion with restriction endonuclease HpaII, and this allowed discrimination between the respective reference strains. Five clinical isolates, four T. denticola and one T. socranskii, were assigned on the basic of their restriction profiles by digestion with HpaII. 16S rRNA gene PCR-RFLP using HpaII is a rapid and reliable method for differentiation of cultivable oral treponemes.
TI  - Detection of spirochetes by polymerase chain reaction and its relation to the course of digital dermatitis after local antibiotic treatment in dairy cattle.
AB  - The aim of the study was to monitor the course of digital dermatitis after local  antibiotic treatment in an experimental group (treated on diagnosis) and a control group (treated 5 days later). The present study was carried out on 2 farms involving 18 animals. Monitoring was performed by means of clinical findings and detection of spirochetes on the surface of the lesions, using a polymerase chain reaction. Superficial wound smears were taken before and after treatment. Twelve animals on both farms followed the classical healing process, but six animals responded poorly to treatment. We observed that without treatment, there was no self-cure in the control group within 5 days. There was a significant improvement in the clinical condition of all animals after treatment on both farms, during the follow-up period. The time until reappearance of new digital dermatitis lesions was not significantly different between the experimental and control group, but it was different between the two farms which could be due to the influence of farm factors. Using primers specific for Treponema denticola and Treponema vincentii, all the disease stages had at least one positive polymerase chain reaction result indicating the presence of spirochetes in samples of all the disease stages during the healing process. This implies that the spirochetes are not completely eradicated from the surface of the lesions after treatment. It was also observed that the classical ulcerative disease stage (M2) had relatively more positive polymerase chain reaction results compared to any other disease stage, showing a possible link between the presence of spirochetes and clinical disease.
TI  - Serological evidence of spirochaetal infections associated with digital dermatitis in dairy cattle.
AB  - A potentially infectious aetiology for digital dermatitis in dairy cattle was investigated and centred on the possible involvement of spirochaetes. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to detect bovine anti-Borrelia burgdorferi (B31) and anti-Treponeme (USA bovine isolates) antibodies in the sera of cows; sera were further tested for antigen specificity by Western blotting. Compared to normal cows, those with digital dermatitis had a much higher seropositivity rate to B. burgdorferi and the treponemes. Significant correlations were shown between antibodies to B. burgdorferi and to Treponemes (P < 0.001), suggesting strong cross-reacting epitopes shared by these spirochaetes. In Western blotting of B. burgdorferi antigens, the main band detected by ELISA positive sera was the 41 kDa flagellar protein; lesser frequency of staining was seen with 34 (OspB), 39 and 55 kDa bands. For the USA treponeme antigens, ELISA positive sera gave reactions to the 34-kDa band and also bands at 41 and 55 kDa. Polyclonal antibodies to Treponema denticola and T. vincentii showed reactions with the bovine treponemes which were predominantly to the 34-kDa antigen. Monoclonal antibodies to B. burgdorferi flagella (41 kDa) antigen and OspA (31 kDa) did not detect any treponeme bands in Western blotting. The study has provided serological evidence that spirochaetes (which are related to human treponemes) may be involved in the pathogenesis of digital dermatitis.
TI  - Identification of seven Treponema species in health- and disease-associated dental plaque by nested PCR.
AB  - Species-specific nested PCR was used to detect Treponema amylovorum, Treponema denticola, Treponema maltophilum, Treponema medium, Treponema pectinovorum, Treponema socranskii, and Treponema vincentii in dental plaque. Subjects with periodontitis harbored all species, but T. pectinovorum and T. vincentii were not found in plaque from disease-free subjects.
TI  - Flagellins, but not endoflagellar sheath proteins, of Treponema pallidum and of pathogen-related oral spirochetes are glycosylated.
AB  - Glycosylation of the flagellar core proteins (FlaBs) was detected in Treponema pallidum Nichols and in the type or reference strains of seven oral Treponema species. In several nonmotile strains of oral treponemes, the FlaBs were undetectable by both antibody and glycan staining. In contrast, a spontaneous low-motility variant of T. vincenti poundi-related strain RitzA, OMZ 305A, lacked the flagellar sheath protein (FlaA) and the two glycan-staining FlaB bands of the wild type, but antibody labeling revealed a novel FlaB band with a lower relative molecular weight. A ca. 38-kDa component of isolated endoflagella of T. vincentii OMZ 800 was identified on Western blots as FlaA by monoclonal antibody (MAb) H9-2, which specifically labels the 37-kDa FlaA protein of T. pallidum. Glycan and H9-2 labeling patterns similar to those of T. pallidum were observed in whole-cell extracts of T. medium G7201 and of 10 strains classified as T. vincentii and as two T. vincentii-related taxons. These four groups were thus identified as cultivable pathogen (T. pallidum)-related oral spirochetes as defined by labeling with MAb H9-2. No H9-2 MAb-reactive component could be detected in T. amylovorum, T. denticola, T. maltophilum, T. pectinovorum, and the three subspecies of T. socranskii.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of cultivable oral treponemes from the Smibert collection.
AB  - Dr. Robert Smibert from the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, USA, isolated and collected over 200 strains of oral treponemes over a 20-year period. Dr. Smibert, Dr. W.E.C. Moore and Dr. L.V. Moore separated these isolates and reference strains into different groups on the basis of cellular fatty acid analysis. In this study, the 16S rRNA genes were sequenced for 47 strains that were representative of these groups. Five distinct species were identified on the basis of 16S rRNA sequence comparisons; two of these species are newly named and three have not yet been characterized. The first species, designated Treponema Smibert-1, was represented by the single strain D4B-1 and was later identified as the newly described Treponema maltophilum. However, strain D4B-1 possessed a different flagellar arrangement to that of T. maltophilum. The second species, Treponema Smibert-2, was represented by nine isolates that possessed identical 16S rRNA gene sequences. The closest relatives of this species were Treponema Smibert-3 and Treponema Smibert-4 at approximately 90% sequence similarity. Within Treponema Smibert-2, there was no correlation between phylogenetic analysis and cellular fatty acid analysis since six different cellular fatty acid groups represented the nine strains. Treponema Smibert-3 (strain D36ER-1) and Treponema Smibert-4 (D62CR-12) were each represented by only a single strain and were closely related to each other at 98% sequence similarity. Strain D36ER-1 of Treponema Smibert-3 was identified as belonging to the not-yet-cultivated phylotype 20 [Choi, B.K., Paster, B.J., Dewhirst, F.E. & Gobel, U.B. (1994). Infect Immun 62, 1889-1895]. Strain D62CR-12 of Treponema Smibert-4 was nearly identical in sequence to the newly described Treponema amylovorum. The fifth species, Treponema Smibert-5, was represented by a single strain, D120CR-1, and was closely related at about 98% sequence similarity to the three subspecies of Treponema socranskii. The polygenetic analyses of strains of Treponema vincentii and of subspecies of T. socranskii are also reported. The closest oral relatives of T. vincentii were Treponema medium at 98.7% sequence similarity and Treponema denticola at 91.5% sequence similarity. T. socranskii subspp. socranskii, buccale and paredis formed three separate phylogenetic branches with sequence similarities of about 98% to each other. The closest relative of the subspecies of T. socranskii and of Smibert-5 was Smibert-2 at about 86% sequence similarity. Historic reference strains Fuji, 'Treponema ambigua', Fm, Ichelson-2, N-39, TD2, TRRD, MRB, IPP, Jethro and T32A, as well as an unkown strain designated only as Treponema oralis, were identified as strains of T. denticola. Reference strains Fuji, Jethro, T32A, and IPP plus three isolates of the Smibert collection were also contaminated with a mycoplasma as determined by 16S rRNA comparative analysis. Consequently, spirochaetal cultures should be screened for mycoplasmas. There are presently at least ten species of cultivable oral species of treponema with the cut-off for separate species designation at about 98% sequence similarity. However, DNA-DNA reassociation experiments are necessary to differentiate species when 16S rDNA sequence similarities are at about this level.
TI  - The frequent detection of a treponeme in bovine digital dermatitis by immunocytochemistry and polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - A study was carried out to determine whether spirochaetes are frequently associated with digital dermatitis in United Kingdom (UK) dairy cattle. Histopathological examination of lesions using a silver stain showed a large number of unidentified spirochaete-like organisms present in digital dermatitis hoof skin tissue in all examined biopsies. Immunocytochemical staining demonstrated that spirochaetes in skin lesions were identified by polyclonal antisera to Borrelia burgdorferi, Treponema denticola and Treponema vincentii (again all biopsies were positively stained), whereas monoclonal antibodies to B. burgdorferi and any Treponema pallidum did not stain any organisms in all biopsies. A PCR of 16S rRNA, previously shown to be specific for a new treponeme, was employed and produced positive results from 82.4% of digital dermatitis tissues. It is concluded that this spirochaete (or related spirochaetes), which is similar to human oral treponemes, is frequently associated with, and may be responsible for, pathological changes in digital dermatitis.
TI  - An inexpensive solid medium for obtaining colony-forming units of oral spirochetes.
AB  - A method for the enumeration of colony-forming units of oral anaerobic spirochetes in new oral spirochete agarose (NOS-A) medium was described recently. However, the high cost of agarose limits the extent to which large assays can be carried out. Accordingly, a search for an inexpensive gelling agent that remains molten at 37 degrees C and gels at 25 degrees C was undertaken. Varying amounts of Noble agar or Bacto agar (0.5 to 1.5%, w/v) were mixed with varying amounts of gelatin (0.5 to 1.0%, w/v) in NOS medium. NOS medium containing 0.5% gelatin-0.5% Noble agar (NOS-GN) or 0.5% gelatin-0.5% Bacto agar (NOS-GB) met the above criteria. NOS-GN and NOS-GB media yielded higher colony-forming units with Treponema denticola than NOS-A medium in that order. However, all three media, NOS-GN, NOS-GB and NOS-A, performed equally well in the recovery of viable counts of T. vincentii. The NOS-GN medium was not liquefied by subgingival bacteria or two gelatinase-producing species of bacteria, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. Thus NOS-GN medium is the recommended medium both in cost and performance for obtaining colony counts of spirochetes.
TI  - Virulence characteristics of oral treponemes in a murine model.
AB  - This study was designed to investigate the virulence characteristics of Treponema denticola, T. socranskii, T. pectinovorum, and T. vincentii following challenge infection of mice. These microorganisms induced well-demarcated, dose-dependent, raised subcutaneous (s.c.) abscesses which were similar in time of onset, lesion progression, and duration of healing. Only viable cells were capable of inducing these characteristic s.c. abscesses. Histological examination of the skin lesion 3 and 5 days postinfection revealed abscess formation in the s.c. tissues, and abundant spiral organisms were demonstrated to be present in the abscess. Host resistance modulation by dexamethasone (neutrophil alteration) and cyclophosphamide (neutrophil depletion) pretreatment had a minimal effect on the virulence expression by any of these treponemes. The T. denticola isolates demonstrated significant trypsin-like protease (TLPase) activity, while both T. socranskii and T. vincentii were devoid of this activity. Interestingly, T. pectinovorum strains were heterogeneous with respect to TLPase as high producers, low producers, and nonproducers. However, no differences in lesion formation were noted regardless of whether the species expressed this proteolytic activity or whether treatment with N alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) and dithiothreitol was performed. These results showed that (i) a murine model may be used to evaluate virulence expression by oral treponemes; (ii) while TLPase activity varies among the oral treponemes, this protease does not appear to participate in abscess induction in the mouse model; and (iii) T. pectinovorum strains show variation in TLPase activity.
TI  - Differential attachment of oral treponemes to monolayers of epithelial cells.
AB  - This in vitro study describes the attachment properties of several oral treponemes to monolayers of epithelial cells and the effect of epithelial cell confluence on treponeme attachment. Four serotypes of Treponema denticola, Treponema scoliodontum, three subspecies of Treponema socranskii, and Treponema vincentii were tested with monolayers of epithelial cells of human and canine origin. Attachment of oral treponemes were compared to attachment by T. pallidum subsp. pallidum, and by the non-pathogen Treponema phagedenis. Results indicated that different serotypes of T. denticola had similar abilities to attach to epithelial cells. However, subspecies of T. socranskii differed in their ability to attach to epithelial cells. The proportion of epithelial cells susceptible to attachment by oral spirochetes was strongly related to the confluence level of the monolayer. In contrast, T. pallidum attached equally well to both epithelial cell lines at all confluence levels. T. phagedenis attached to < 1% of all epithelial cells. In general, attachment of oral treponemes to canine cells was lower than to human cells, suggesting species-specificity for adherence. Attachment of oral treponemes to epithelial cells may promote colonization of the periodontal pocket, as well as retention of treponeme colonies within plaque. The preference of oral treponemes to attach to cells of low confluence fields may translate in vivo to an increased ability to attach to cells which are actively dividing. Such cells are found in areas of repair, a common status within inflamed periodontal pockets. Furthermore, attachment of oral treponemes to epithelial cell barriers may promote or potentiate cytopathic processes.
TI  - Identification, isolation, and characterization of the 42-kilodalton major outer  membrane protein (MompA) from Treponema pectinovorum ATCC 33768.
AB  - The major protein present in the isolated outer membrane of Treponema pectinovorum ATCC 33768, MompA, was identified, purified, and characterized. Immuno-gold electron microscopy, using anti-MompA serum, and cell fractionation experiments confirmed the localization of MompA to the outer membrane. MompA was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to have a molecular mass of 42 kDa when heat denatured, whereas native MompA formed a number of detergent-stable forms with molecular masses of 71, 76, and 83 kDa. A temperature of 60 degrees C was required to convert the native protein to the 42-kDa form. A number of detergents and chemical agents that are capable of breaking ionic and hydrogen bonds of proteins did not convert native MompA to the 42-kDa species. The native forms of the protein were resistant to the combined action of proteinase K, trypsin, and chymotrypsin, whereas the 42-kDa form of MompA was not. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of MompA was determined to be DVTVNINSRVRPVLYTT, and database searches did not identify any homology with known protein sequences. Amino acid compositional analysis showed the protein to be rich in proline and glycine, with these amino acids accounting for 28 and 13%, respectively, of the total amino acids. Antiserum raised against the major outer membrane protein of T. denticola GM-1 and ATCC 35405 did not cross-react with MompA, and antiserum raised against MompA did not react with any cellular components of Treponema denticola, Treponema vincentii, or Treponema socranskii. A major outer membrane protein similar in molecular mass to MompA was identified in eight clinical isolates of T. pectinovorum. The major outer membrane protein produced by four of the clinical isolates reacted strongly, by Western blotting, with anti-MompA serum, whereas proteins of the other strains did not.
TI  - Genetic characterization of an oral treponeme isolated from human subgingival plaque.
AB  - We examined the genetic characteristics of a human oral treponeme isolated from subgingival plaque of a patient with periodontal disease that could not be assigned to any of the previously described oral Treponema species. The guanine-plus-cytosine content of its DNA was 51 mole%. The levels of DNA-DNA relatedness of the organism to other Treponema species, including Treponema denticola, Treponema vincentii, Treponema socranskii, Treponema pallidum and Treponema phagedenis, were less than 30%. This study clearly demonstrated that the isolated treponeme could be completely distinct from the established oral Treponema species genetically. Also, the study indicated remarkable genetic heterogeneity among human oral Treponema species.
TI  - Visualization of an extracellular mucoid layer of Treponema denticola ATCC 35405  and surface sugar lectin analysis of some Treponema species.
AB  - Slime layers and capsules are common amongst medically relevant bacteria. We herein report that Treponema denticola, which has been associated with periodontitis, synthesizes or acquires an extracellular polysaccharide layer that we have observed through electron microscopy using the polysaccharide-specific dye Alcian blue and phosphotungstate. We have also visualized this extracellular layer by dark-field microscopy of Alcian blue-stained spirochete cells. A representative strain of each of the oral spirochete species T. denticola, Treponema vincentii and Treponema socranskii were differentiated by concanavalin A, phaseolus, lotus A and arachis lectins in a microtiter plate immunoassay for the detection of surface sugars.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes exposed to the oral environment.
AB  - Microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (GTR) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. The purpose of this study was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). The study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. In each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (P1, P2, M1, M2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). These teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). A 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with an external sling suture. With oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. Slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (A. actinomycetemcomitans, A. viscosus, B. melaninogenicus, F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, S. mutans, S. sanguis, Selenomonas sputigena, T. denticola, and T. vincentii) were present. Semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and Pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (P < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. These results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.
TI  - Conservation of msp, the gene encoding the major outer membrane protein of oral Treponema spp.
AB  - The major surface protein (Msp) of Treponema denticola has been implicated as a mediator of the interaction between the spirochete and the gingival epithelium in periodontal diseases. Previous studies showed that the Msp of T. denticola ATCC 35405 had porin activity, depolarized epithelial cell membranes, bound to extracellular matrix components of epithelial cells, and formed a regular hexagonal surface array in the treponemal outer membrane. The gene encoding Msp in ATCC 35405 was recently cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli (J. C. Fenno, K.-H. Muller, and B. C. McBride, J. Bacteriol. 178:2489-2496, 1996). In the present study, we identified genes encoding Msp-like proteins in several oral spirochetes. A prominent heat-modifiable Msp-like protein having an apparent molecular mass of between 43 and 64 kDa was present in all oral spirochete strains tested. Antibodies raised against the ATCC 35405 Msp reacted strongly with the Msp proteins of T. denticola ATCC 35404 and T. vincentii, reacted very weakly with the Msp protein of T. denticola ATCC 33520, and did not react with T. denticola OTK, T. socranskii, and T. pectinovorum. The msp loci of the T. denticola strains and T. vincentii were identified in analyses using PCR with oligonucleotide primers derived from the DNA sequence flanking msp in ATCC 35405. Southern blot analysis showed at least three groups of related msp DNA sequences. Comparison of DNA sequences of the 5' and 3' ends of the msp genes showed high sequence homology in the flanking regions and signal peptide coding regions, while the homologies between regions encoding the mature peptide were as low as 50%. The entire msp DNA sequences of T. denticola ATCC 33520 and OTK were determined, and the deduced Msp amino acid sequences were compared to the sequence of the previously reported Msp of ATCC 35405. The results show that the msp locus is conserved in oral treponemes but that there are significant differences between the mature Msp peptides of different strains. Further studies of the antigenic domains, functional domains, and physical structures of Msp proteins, based on these results, will enhance understanding of the role of Msp in the cytopathology associated with oral spirochetes.
TI  - Treponema medium sp. nov., isolated from human subgingival dental plaque.
AB  - A new Treponema species, for which we propose the name Treponema medium, was isolated from subgingival plaque from an adult with periodontal disease. The morphological characteristics, differential biochemical characteristics, and protein profiles on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels of this organism are described. The guanine-plus-cytosine content of the DNA of T. medium is 51 mol%. The levels of DNA-DNA relatedness of the new species to other Treponema species, including Treponema denticola, Treponema vincentii, Treponema socranskii, Treponema pallidum, and Treponema phagedenis, are less than 30%. A phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA sequences distinguished the new Treponema strain from strains belonging to previously described Treponema species. The type strain of T. medium is strain G7201.
TI  - An extracellular enzyme with hyaluronidase and chondroitinase activities from some oral anaerobic spirochaetes.
AB  - Treponema denticola, Treponema vincentii and Treponema socranskii produce an enzyme that hydrolyses hyaluronic acid (HA) and chondroitin sulphate (CS). The secreted enzyme is specifically inhibited by gold sodium thiomalate and anti-bee-venom antibodies. The use of saturated substrate (HA or CS) transblots allowed the visualization of active enzyme directly from culture supernatants and is a useful tool in clarification of complex polysaccharide-degrading enzyme specificities. The affinity-purified extracellular enzyme of T. denticola contains a single molecular species with a molecular mass of 59 kDa. Since it hydrolyses both HA and CS, it can more appropriately be termed a hyaluronoglucosaminidase (HGase). The HGase has been localized at the cell surface by electron microscopy and may play an active role in the degradation of connective tissue ground substance in the initiation and progression of periodontal disease.
TI  - Treponema maltophilum sp. nov., a small oral spirochete isolated from human periodontal lesions.
AB  - A novel culture medium for cultivation of fastidious oral anaerobes is described. This medium, OMIZ-Pat, consists of a rich chemically defined basal medium supplemented with asialofetuin, as well as yeast extract and Neopeptone fractions. Addition of 1 mg of rifampin per liter and 100 mg of fosfomycin per liter allowed routine isolation of spirochetes by a limit dilution method in 96-well plates containing liquid OMIZ-Pat. In addition to members of the four previously recognized species of oral treponemes (Treponema denticola, Treponema pectinovorum, Treponema socranskii, and Treponema vincentii), 26 previously undescribed spirochete strains belonging to one group were isolated. We propose the name Treponema maltophilum sp. nov. for these small spirochetes, which have two endoflagella; one endoflagellum is attached at each cell pole, and the endoflagella overlap in the middle of the cell. Growth of these organisms was dependent on a carbohydrate like D-arabinose, L-fucose, D-maltose, L-rhamnose, D-ribose, D-sucrose, or D-trehalose and was inhibited by fetal bovine serum. T. Maltophilum is distinguished from other oral Treponema species by its 16S rRNA sequence, its protein and antigen patterns as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting, and its characteristic alpha-glucosidase activity. The strains included in the new species on the basis of their 16S rRNA sequences are heterogeneous with respect to their alpha-fucosidase, and beta-glucuronidase activities, their dependence on N-acetylglucosamine, and their antigens as detected with patient antibodies. Strain BR is designated the type strain, and strains HO2A and PNA1 are reference strains of the new species.
TI  - Characterization of new periodontal and endodontic isolates of spirochetes.
AB  - Gas chromatographic analysis of cellular fatty acids (CFA), biochemical reactions, electrophoresis of soluble cellular proteins, as well as immunodiffusion were used to discriminate between 16 fresh spirochete isolates from periodontal and endodontic infections. CFA patterns were compared by the Hewlett Packard MIDI library to all available reference strains, and results of the biochemical tests were compared to VPI's records for treponemal strains. The electrophoretograms of soluble proteins of the fresh isolates were compared to those of previously well described strains of Treponema denticola, T. pectinovorum, T. vincentii, T. socranskii subsp. socranskii, T. socranskii subsp. paredis, T. socranskii subsp. buccale, and T. socranskii 04. Immunodiffusion was carried out by using adsorbed polyclonal rabbit antibodies to representative strains of the species mentioned. These methods separated most clinical strains from approved species strains, suggesting that new species had been isolated.
TI  - Intergeneric coaggregation of oral Treponema spp. with Fusobacterium spp. and intrageneric coaggregation among Fusobacterium spp.
AB  - A total of 22 strains of Treponema spp. including members of all four named human oral species were tested for coaggregation with 7 strains of oral fusobacteria, 2 strains of nonoral fusobacteria, and 45 strains of other oral bacteria, which included actinobacilli, actinomyces, capnocytophagae, eubacteria, porphyromonads, prevotellae, selenomonads, streptococci, and veillonellae. None of the treponemes coaggregated with any of the latter 45 oral strains or with the two nonoral fusobacteria. All treponemes, eight Treponema denticola strains, eight T. socranskii strains, four oral pectinolytic treponemes, one T. pectinovorum strain, and one T. vincentii strain coaggregated with at least one strain of the fusobacteria tested as partners. The partners consisted of one strain of Fusobacterium periodonticum, five F. nucleatum strains including all four subspecies of F. nucleatum, and a strain of F. simiae obtained from the dental plaque of a monkey. In the more than 100 coaggregations observed, the fusobacterial partner was heat inactivated (85 degrees C for 30 min), while the treponemes were unaffected by the heat treatment. Furthermore, the fusobacteria were usually inactivated by proteinase K treatment, and the treponemes were not affected. Only the T. denticola coaggregations were inhibited by lactose and D-galactosamine. None were inhibited by any of 23 other different sugars or L-arginine. Intragenic coaggregations were seen among the subspecies of F. nucleatum and with F. periodonticum, and none were inhibited by any of the sugars tested or by L-arginine. No intrageneric coaggregations were observed among the treponemes. These data indicate that the human oral treponemes show a specificity for oral fusobacteria as coaggregation partners. Such cell-to cell contact may facilitate efficient metabolic communication and enhance the proliferation of each cell in the progressively more severe stages of periodontal disease.
TI  - Characterization of oral treponemes isolated from human periodontal pockets.
AB  - A total of 90 clinical strains of oral treponemes was isolated from subgingival plaque in patients with periodontal disease. They were characterized by biochemical means as well as cell enzyme, protein analysis using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and DNA dot blot hybridization. Sixty strains were isolated on Medium 10 (M10), which was fundamentally serum-free. The remainder were isolated on serum-containing media. Isolates were divided into 6 groups according to their biochemical characteristics. Three of the 6 groups were asaccharolytic, and 2 of these 3 groups were Treponema denticola and "Treponema vincentii". The other 3 groups were saccharolytic and further divided into 9 subgroups. The analysis of cell enzyme, cell protein and dot blot hybridization with the DNA probe of Treponema socranskii indicated that all the saccharolytic groups were T. socranskii or closely related species. This study indicated that the newly characterized saccharolytic oral treponemes could be identified using M10 from the human periodontal pocket.
TI  - Capillary zone electrophoresis as a new tool in the chemotaxonomy of oral treponemes.
AB  - The existing taxonomy of oral treponemes is not satisfactory. This is due to the  fact that these strict anaerobic bacteria are not easily cultivated or differentiated. Therefore, new techniques that can contribute to improved cultivation, classification, and identification of these fastidious organisms should be welcomed. In the present study capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) was used to distinguish oral treponemes by their metabolic product patterns generated in a liquid medium. To our knowledge this technique has not previously been used in bacterial chemotaxonomy. Reference strains of Treponema denticola, Treponema pectinovorum, Treponema vincentii, Treponema socranskii subspecies buccale and Treponema socranskii subspecies socranskii were cultured anaerobically in duplicate on different days in Pectin medium for 4 days at 37 degrees C under nitrogen atmosphere. Treponemal cells were harvested by centrifugation. Thereafter, their supernatants were filtered through 0.22-micron Millipore filters and subjected to CZE. The resulting electropherograms clearly distinguished T. denticola, T. pectinovorum and T. vincentii. Minor differences were detected between T. socranskii subspecies buccale and T. socranskii subspecies socranskii. Subspecies were clearly different from species. It seems that CZE of culture metabolites, which showed high resolution and good reproducibility, may be a valuable tool in the chemotaxonomy of oral treponemes, even at the subspecies level.
TI  - Coaggregation between Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola.
AB  - To elucidate an ecological profile of several periodontopathogens, the authors examined the coaggregation between cells of Porphyromonas gingivalis and oral bacterial strains including Treponema denticola in vitro. Coaggregation between cells of plaque bacteria was examined by visual assay and phase-contrast microscope. P. gingivalis cells coaggregated with strains of T. denticola and Treponema socranskii subspecies socranskii, but did not coaggregate with T. socranskii subspecies buccale, T. socranskii subspecies paredis, Treponema vincentii, or Treponema pectinovorum. The extracted hemagglutinin from P. gingivalis was active agglutinating T. denticola cells. Addition of serum and saliva somewhat affected the coaggregation, but no effects of tested sugars or amino acids were found. Heat treatment of T. denticola cells did not reduce the coagregation: heat treatment of P. gingivalis cells eliminated it. Growth inhibitory activity among these bacterial species was examined by the stab culture method. Strains of T. denticola ATCC 35404 and 35405 and T. vincentii inhibited the growth of some P. gingivalis strains, but not others. No strain of Treponema was inhibited by black-pigmented anaerobic rods. The coaggregation observed between P. gingivalis and T. denticola indicates the potential importance of their simultaneous existence in human periodontal pockets and development of the disease.
TI  - Diversity of cultivable and uncultivable oral spirochetes from a patient with severe destructive periodontitis.
AB  - To determine the genetic diversity of cultivable and uncultivable spirochetes in  the gingival crevice of a patient with severe periodontitis, partial 16S rRNA genes were cloned from PCR-amplified products of DNA and RNA extracted from a subgingival plaque sample. Approximately 500 bp were amplified in PCRs by using universally conserved primers with polylinker tails. Purified PCR products were cloned into Escherichia coli by using the plasmid vector pUC19. The resultant clone library was screened by colony hybridization with a radiolabeled, treponeme-specific oligonucleotide probe. The 16S rRNA inserts of 81 spirochetal clones were then sequenced by standard procedures. Sequences were compared with 16S rRNA sequences of 35 spirochetes, including the four known cultivable oral treponeme species. The analysis revealed an unexpected diversity of oral treponemes from a single patient. When 98% or greater sequence similarity was used as the definition of a species-level cluster, the clone sequences were found to represent 23 species. When 92% similarity was used as the definition, the clones fell into eight major groups, only two of which contained named species, Treponema vincentii and Treponema denticola, while Treponema pectinovorum and Treponema socranskii were not represented in any cluster. Seven of the 81 spirochetal clones were found to contain chimeric 16S rRNA sequences. In situ fluorescence hybridization with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled oligonucleotide probe specific for one of the new species representing cluster 19 was used to identify cells of the target species directly in clinical samples.
TI  - Outer membrane antigens of oral Treponema species.
AB  - Outer membrane (OM) antigens of several oral treponemes were studied. SDS-PAGE revealed a 56-58-kDa protein as a major component of isolated OM vesicles. Immunoblot analysis with eluted antibodies prepared from Treponema denticola ATCC 33520 recognised the 56-58-kDa protein, which was highly conserved in the 17 T. denticola strains tested. The protein was also a component of a T. denticola desoxycholate-extractable, ethanol-soluble antigen (DES-Ag) but was not present in T. pectinovorum or T. vincentii ATCC 35580 and strain N9 whole-cell lysates. Electronmicroscopy of OM vesicles showed typical treponemal ultrastructure. Immunogold labelling of T. denticola ATCC 33520 with T. denticola ATCC 33520-specific eluted antibodies recognised only the OM surface of the cell. These results suggest that the 56-58-kDa antigen comprises surface-orientated epitopes and that this antigen may be specific for T. denticola.
TI  - Binding of host-associated treponeme proteins to collagens and laminin: a possible mechanism of spirochetal adherence to host tissues.
AB  - The polypeptides of seven strains of human treponemes were investigated by immunoblot analysis for their binding to the human placental collagens and laminin. Of the treponemal polypeptides, eleven polypeptides, 45-kDa, 49-kDa, and 62-kDa polypeptides from T. pallidum ATCC 27087, a 48-kDa polypeptide from T. phagedenis biotype Reiter, 51-kDa and 53-kDa polypeptides from T. vincentii ATCC 35580, 30-kDa, 53-kDa and 63-kDa polypeptides from T. socranskii subsp. buccale ATCC 35534, a 52-kDa polypeptide from T. denticola ATCC 35405, and a 53-kDa polypeptide from T. denticola ATCC 33520 possessed an ability to bind to the laminin, type I, III, IV, or V collagen. An intermediate-sized human oral isolate strain G7201 did not possess any laminin- or collagen-binding polypeptides. Immunoelectron microscopy using intact treponemal cells with a single collagen-binding polypeptide and the corresponding antisera demonstrated that the 51-kDa and 53-kDa polypeptides from T. vincentii, the 53-kDa polypeptide from T. socranskii subsp. buccale ATCC 35534 and the 52-kDa polypeptide from T. denticola ATCC 35405, were outer envelope proteins.
TI  - Binding of hemin and congo red by oral hemolytic spirochetes.
AB  - Colony-forming units or cells in suspension of oral anaerobic spirochetes (Treponema denticola, Treponema vincentii and Treponema socranskii) bind hemin and Congo red. Hemin or Congo red binds to a hydrophobic polypeptide receptor that is located in the outer membrane of the bacterial cells and it has a relative molecular mass of 47 kDa. These oral spirochetes also lyse sheep erythrocytes to produce beta-hemolytic zones around colony-forming units. The oral spirochetes may acquire iron for growth when they lyse erythrocytes and bind heme from which they may sequester and transport iron into the cells.
TI  - Viscosity-dependent locomotion of oral spirochetes.
AB  - Spirochetes are thought to remain motile in environments (such as intercellular spaces) that immobilize extracellularly flagellated eubacteria. This attribute suggests that the viscosity of the milieu is of importance to locomotion. We sought to determine the interdependence of oral spirochete locomotion with media viscosity. Video time-lapse microscopy using darkfield optics was used. The motility of the spirochetes in media of different viscosities (various concentrations of Noble agar) was measured. Treponema denticola exhibited the fastest speed (18.7 +/- 4.4 microns/min) at a viscosity of 30 mPa.s. The highest speeds for Treponema vincentii and Treponema socranskii were 41.9 +/- 14.9 and 33.4 +/- 13.2 microns/min, respectively, at 88 mPa.s. These data show that optimal migration of spirochetes is viscosity-dependent. The results support the hypothesis that such viscosity-dependent locomotion could be a virulence factor that enables oral spirochetes to initiate and sustain periodontal disease.
TI  - Aspartame as a source of essential phenylalanine for the growth of oral anaerobes.
AB  - Phenylalanine and aspartic acid requirements were determined for 13 species of oral bacteria using the chemically defined medium OMIZ-W1. None of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus, Eikenella corrodens, Selenomonas sputigena, Treponema pectinovorum, T. socranskii, or Wolinella recta required either of these amino acid constituents of aspartame (L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methylester). Phenylalanine was essential for the growth of Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Eubacterium timidum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, T. denticola, and T. vincentii, while aspartic acid was not required. With the exception of E. timidum, all phenylalanine-dependent strains could grow when the free amino acid was replaced by aspartame at concentrations at least 10-fold lower than those used for aspartame as an artificial sweetener.
TI  - A successful method for quantifying viable oral anaerobic spirochetes.
AB  - Spirochetes are markedly prevalent in periodontal disease but are not included as predominant cultivable organisms because of the inability to quantify them by viable count. A successful method was developed for enumerating viable oral spirochetes as colony-forming units (CFU) in an agarose-based medium. Treponema denticola, Treponema vincentii and Treponema socranskii in log-phase growth in new oral spirochete (NOS) broth were used for evaluation of the method. Critical components of the method include enzyme-free low temperature-gelling (37 degrees C) agarose in NOS medium in small tissue-culture flasks into which the spirochetes were seeded and diluted. The flasks were anaerobically incubated in a glove-box. Reliable, consistent and reproducible viable counts of pure spirochete cultures were obtained. The injurious effects of spirochete temperature-sensitivity were averted by using molten agarose at 37 degrees C. Distinctive colony morphologies of spirochete species could be compared from pure cultures. Addition of rifampin into the medium showed no decrease in spirochete CFU count. The method as described allows for selection of mutants and detection of biochemical activity and is potentially useful for enumeration of spirochetes from periodontal pockets as members of the predominant cultivable flora.
TI  - [Isolation and characterization of oral treponemes].
AB  - The oral treponemes were isolated on nine media and classified according to Anaerobe Laboratory Manual (1977). The four media, which were used with the plate-in-bottle method, were Medium 10 (M10), M10 supplemented with 10% rumen fluid, M10 supplemented with 10% rabbit serum and cocarboxylate, and M10 added with rifampicin. The five media with the anaerobic glove box method were New Oral Spirochetes (NOS) medium, NOS medium added with rifampicin, alternated modified Oral Treponemes Isolation (aOTI) medium, and alternated M10 for anaerobic glove box. The isolation rate of the oral treponemes from 59 subgingival plaque samples of various forms of periodontal diseases was 85 percent. Ninety clinical isolates were subcultured and classified into six groups (I-VI) based on the carbohydrate fermentation and metabolic end products. Three saccaharolytic groups were further divided into nine subgroups by the fermentation patterns of sucrose, lactose, maltose and rhamnose. Two saccaharolytic subgroups were identified as Treponema socranskii, and two asaccharolytic groups were identified as "T. denticola" and "T. vincentii". However, the other subgroups and group could not be identified according to the characteristics of the presently recognized species.
TI  - Antimicrobial action of AXOL on periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial action of AXOL was tested against a panel of periodontopathic bacteria, which included Treponema denticola, Treponema vincentii, Treponema sp., Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The AXOL commercial solution (undiluted) was effective in inhibiting some of the bacteria but not all. The rational for the use of antimicrobials is discussed.
TI  - Growth of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, T. pectinovorum, T. socranskii, and T. vincentii in a chemically defined medium.
AB  - A chemically defined medium, OMIZ (Oral Microbiology and Immunology, Zurich)-W1 was developed. Medium OMIZ-W1 supports the long-term proliferation of a wide range of oral anaerobes, including representative strains of four Treponema species and Porphyromonas gingivalis. High concentrations of ascorbic acid and ammonium ions proved to be important for the growth of these organisms. T. denticola CD-1 grew in the absence of polyamines and long-chain fatty acids, T. pectinovorum and T. socranskii required polyamines, whereas T. vincentii depended on both polyamines and lecithin for growth. Specific requirements for purines and/or pyrimidines were detected, and these requirements could be used to distinguish Haemophilus-Actinobacillus group organisms. Some strains of P. gingivalis grew without vitamin K, while others were not satisfied by menadione but required its precursor 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid. Protoporphyrin IX or hemin equally satisfied the porphyrin requirements of P. gingivalis and Bacteroides forsythus, whereas ferrous sulfate was more efficiently used as a source of iron than was hemin. The cellular cohesiveness of P. gingivalis increased with high concentrations of hemin in the growth medium. Prevotella intermedia, B. forsythus, and several strains of P. gingivalis were more fastidious and required a protein or serum supplement to grow in medium OMIZ-W1.
TI  - Use of randomly cloned DNA fragments for the identification of oral spirochetes.
AB  - DNA probes were produced for the detection and identification of 4 cultivable species of oral spirochetes, Treponema denticola, Treponema socranskii, Treponema vincentii and Treponema pectinovorum. To obtain probe sequences, chromosomal DNA, isolated from representative strains within each species, was cloned in Escherichia coli K-12. Cloned DNA fragments were screened for the ability to hybridize to DNA only from homologous strains. Several such fragments were identified and shown to be specific when tested against a series of DNAs from gram-negative and gram-positive oral bacteria. The selected probe sequences were semi-conserved within strains of T. denticola and T. socranskii such that restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was observed. In the case of T. socranskii, RFLP was useful in distinguishing between the 3 known subspecies. Chromosomal DNA fragments from 2 strains of T. vincentii failed to cross-hybridize, under stringent conditions, to genomic DNA from each of these strains. The hybridization probes were suitable for the identification of clinical isolates of T. denticola and could be used to detect the presence of individual Treponema species in mixed cultures. On this basis, the probes were used successfully to detect T. denticola in uncultured plaque samples.
TI  - Comparison of peptidase, glycosidase and esterase activities of oral and non-oral Treponema species.
AB  - The enzyme profiles of 20 oral and non-oral Treponema strains were investigated using an API ZYM Complete Research kit. The test included 10 2-naphthyl derivatives of fatty acids, 20 p-nitrophenol derivatives of carbohydrates and 60 2-naphthylamide derivatives of amino acids and peptides. The oral Treponema species investigated were T. denticola, T. vincentii and T. Pectinovorum. The non-oral species examined were T. phagedenis, T. hyodysenteriae and intestinal spirochaetes of human and chicken origin. Esterase activities on C5 to C10 fatty acids were common among different Treponema species. Glycosidase activities were infrequently observed in T. vincentii, T. pectinovorum and T. phagedenis Reiter strain. Arabinosidase, lactosidase and xylosidase activity was observed in the T. hyodysenteriae strains but alpha-L-fucosidase activity was found only in T. denticola and T. phagedenis. More exo- and endo-peptidase activities were found in T. denticola than in other species. The enteropathogenic T. hyodysenteriae isolates had a very low proteolytic profile. Dipeptidyl prolyl amidase activity was observed in all species except in the T. phagedenis Reiter strain and the avian intestinal spirochaetes. The enzyme profiles did not discriminate between oral and non-oral Treponema species.
TI  - [Chemical composition and biological activities of lipopolysaccharides extracted  from Treponema denticola and Treponema vincentii].
AB  - Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) were isolated from Treponema denticola (T. denticola)  and Treponema vincentii (T. vincentii) by the phenol/water (PW) and the phenol/chloroform/petroleum-ether (PCP) procedures. 1) T. denticola PW-LPS (LPS isolated by the PW procedure), PCP-sup-LPS (LPS isolated by the PCP procedure in the supernates of ultracentrifugation), PCP-ppt-LPS (precipitated LPS isolated by the PCP procedure, obtained after ultracentrifugation), and T. vincentii PCP-ppt-LPS were composed of carbohydrate, hexosamine, protein, fatty acid, and phosphorus. T. vincentii PW-LPS was contained major amount of carbohydrates and small amount of fatty acids. 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonic acid (KDD) was not detected in these LPSs. 2) The major fatty acids of T. denticola PW-LPS and PCP-sup-LPS were palmitic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic acids. The major fatty acids of T. vincentii PCP-ppt-LPS were palmitic, stearic, myristic, oleic, and linoleic acids. Hydroxy fatty acids were not detected. 3) Glucose, galactose, and mannose were comprised in T. denticola PW-LPS. Glucose, galactose, and arabinose were comprised in T. denticola PCP-sup-LPS. Glucose and galactose were comprised in T. vincentii PCP-ppt-LPS. 4) The Limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) clotting activity of T. denticola PW-LPS was 1/10, as compared with that of Escherichia coli (E. coli) UKT-B LPS standard. The LAL clotting activities of T. denticola PCP-sup-LPS, T. vincentii PW-LPS, and T. vincentii PCP-ppt-LPS were 1/100, as compared with that of E. coli LPS standard. 5) Five hundred micrograms/kg of T. denticola PCP-sup-LPS was pyrogenic in rabbits. Two thousand micrograms/kg of T. vincentii PCP-ppt-LPS was pyrogenic in rabbits. 6) T. denticola PCP-sup-LPS and T. vincentii PCP-ppt-LPS were capable of increasing or decreasing the release of lysosomal enzymes from human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
TI  - Cross-reactivity of nonspecific treponemal antibody in serologic tests for Lyme disease.
AB  - Serum samples obtained from 59 persons who had acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, periodontitis, syphilis, or Lyme disease were tested against Treponema phagedenis biotype Reiter, Treponema denticola, Treponema vincentii, and Treponema scoliodontum by indirect fluorescent-antibody staining methods. Although there were positive reactions for sera representing each of these study groups and for 20 (13%) of 156 samples collected from the general population (premarital screening for syphilis), titration endpoints were relatively low (less than or equal to 1:256). Serum samples from 18 persons who had gingivitis or periodontitis but no history of Lyme borreliosis were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi. Of these, five (28%) had immunoglobulin M antibody and four (22%) contained immunoglobulin G antibodies to this spirochete. Adsorption with either sorbent commercially prepared from T. phagedenis biotype Reiter or with washed, whole cells of T. phagedenis biotype Reiter reduced cross-reactivity in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for Lyme borreliosis.
TI  - [Nutritional requirements for oral Treponema].
AB  - Oral Treponema is still difficult to cultivate in vitro because of lacking of our knowledge about what they require for growth. The aim of this study was to find what were the nutritional requirements for them. Treponema denticola, T. vincentii, and T. socranskii were cultivated in various broths to seek which fractions of tryptone and rabbit serum, or serum proteins were stimulatory. Treponemal growth was assessed by turbidity readings. It was obvious that a weakly negative-charged peptide isolated from tryptone with molecular weight of about 800 daltons was stimulatory. However, further characterization of this peptide was failed, since the yield of the final fractions was too low to be identified with the conventional methods. The results on rabbit serum fractionated by a liquid chromatograph showed that serum proteins with molecular weight of 150,000 daltons were also stimulatory for T. denticola. Among the commercially available serum proteins, human and bovine ceruloplasmin gave good results. They could substitute for rabbit serum in the growth of T. denticola and T. vincentii.
TI  - Enzyme profiles of oral spirochetes in RapID-ANA system.
AB  - Enzyme profiles of oral Treponema species were determined by using RapID-ANA (Innovative Diagnostic System, Atlanta, Ga.), a 4-h test system which detects 18 enzymatic reactions, including aminopeptidases and glycosidases. Seventy-two clinical isolates of Treponema denticola, four reference strains of T. denticola (ATCC 35404, ATCC 35405, ATCC 35520, and ATCC 33521), one strain of T. vincentii (ATCC 35580), and two strains of T. socranskii subspecies (T. socranskii subsp. buccale ATCC 35534 and T. socranskii subsp. socranskii ATCC 35536) were used in this study. All T. denticola strains produced indole and a variety of aminopeptidases and glycosidases. These organisms could be differentiated into two groups on the basis of tetrazolium reductase and serine, phenylalanine, and glycine aminopeptidase activities. T. vincentii produced N-acetylglucosaminidase and arginine aminopeptidase, which facilitated the differentiation of this organism from T. socranskii subspecies and the T. denticola group. T. socranskii subspecies gave positive reactions for alkaline phosphatase only. These findings suggest that the RapID-ANA system is useful for enzymatic characterization and differentiation of oral spirochetes.
TI  - Isolation of a chymotrypsinlike enzyme from Treponema denticola.
AB  - A chymotrypsinlike protease with an Mr of 95,000 was extracted from Treponema denticola ATCC 35405 and was partially purified by preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteolytic activity was detected in an electrophoretogram containing polyacrylamide that was conjugated to bovine serum albumin. A single band of activity was detected when the T. denticola extract was solubilized and electrophoresed in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. No activity was found in extracts of Treponema vincentii. The enzyme hydrolyzed transferrin, fibrinogen, alpha 1-antitrypsin, immunoglobulin A, immunoglobulin G, gelatin, bovine serum albumin, and a synthetic peptide containing phenylalanine. It did not degrade collagen or synthetic substrates containing arginine or proline. For the hydrolysis of azocoll, the pH optimum of the enzyme was 7.5. Heating at temperatures above 50 degrees C destroyed the activity. Reducing agents and the chelators EDTA and ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid increased the enzyme activity, while phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, L-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, sulfhydryl reagents, and human serum reduced activity. The ability of the enzyme to hydrolyze a number of humoral proteins suggests that it may be involved in spirochete invasiveness and tissue destruction.
TI  - Comparison of three dispersion procedures for quantitative recovery of cultivable species of subgingival spirochetes.
AB  - Spirochetes are usually the predominant organisms observed microscopically in subgingival plaques removed from tooth sites associated with periodontitis, but these organisms are rarely isolated by cultural means, presumably because the media do not support their growth and/or because these fragile organisms are disrupted by the various procedures used to disperse plaque samples. In the present investigation, three dispersal procedures, sonification, mechanical mixing, and homogenization, were compared for their ability to permit the isolation of Treponema denticola, Treponema vincentii, Treponema socranskii, and Treponema pectinovorum from plaque samples on media that support the growth of these species. Plaque samples in which the spirochetes averaged 50% of the microscopic count were chosen. The highest viable recoveries of spirochetes were observed when the plaques were dispersed with a Tekmar homogenizer, and the lowest occurred with sonification. The highest recoveries averaged only about 1% of the total cultivable counts, indicating either that the sought-after species were minor members of the flora or that the dispersal procedures were still too harsh. A total of 91% of the isolates were T. denticola, 5% were T. socranskii, and 4% were a heretofore-undescribed species.
TI  - Serum IgA and IgG antibodies to Treponema vincentii and Treponema denticola in adult periodontitis, juvenile periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects.
AB  - 13 patients with untreated adult periodontitis (AP) were compared to 8 subjects free of periodontal disease (H) with respect to plaque index (PlI), gingival index (GI), probing depth (PD) and differential counts of subgingival bacterial morphotypes from a pooled sample of 6 surfaces with the greatest probing depth. Serum antibody levels to T. vincentii and T. denticola strains were also determined in these subjects as well as in the sera from 5 subjects with localized juvenile periodontitis (LJP). Subjects with AP had significantly elevated proportions of spirochetes and motile rods and lower proportions of coccoid cells than H subjects. They also exhibited significantly higher PlI and GI scores and greater probing depths. Antibody levels were normalized against a standard serum and expressed as ELISA units (EU). IgA and IgG antibody levels to all tested spirochete strains were significantly elevated in AP subjects as compared to subjects in group H or subjects with LJP. No significant differences in antibody titers were detectable between the H and LJP groups with respect to any of the tested strains. No significant correlation could be demonstrated between serum antibody titers to any of the oral spirochete strains tested and the proportions of oral spirochetes determined microscopically.
TI  - Microscopic agglutination and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses of oral anaerobic spirochetes.
AB  - Microscopic agglutination (MA) analysis and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) were used to determine strain and species similarities and dissimilarities among three species of oral anaerobic spirochetes, Treponema denticola, Treponema pectinovorum, and Treponema vincentii. The MA analysis revealed a diversity of serologic reactivity or sharing of common antigens within each species. However, there was no cross-reactivity or sharing of common antigens among the three species. Distinct SDS-PAGE whole-cell electrophoretograms for each species were obtained. The banding patterns for 16 T. denticola strains revealed 30 distinct proteins, while the banding patterns for 5 strains of T. pectinovorum and 2 strains of T. vincentii revealed 26 and 35 distinct proteins, respectively. Analysis of the electrophoretograms showed that their respective banding patterns could be used to distinguish the three species from one another. In addition, strain differences within each species could be detected. There was a correlation between MA analysis and SDS-PAGE analysis. It is thus suggested that both MA and SDS-PAGE analysis be included in classification schemes for the identification of oral spirochetes.
TI  - Serospecificity of a cloned protease-resistant Treponema pallidum--specific antigen expressed in Escherichia coli.
AB  - We evaluated the serological reactivity of a protease-resistant antigen designated 4D which was encoded by Treponema pallidum DNA and was expressed in Escherichia coli from recombinant plasmid pAW329. This 19,000-molecular-weight antigen was purified in its native, non-protease-treated form from E. coli sonic extracts by molecular sieving and ion-exchange chromatography. Antibody binding to antigen 4D was detected by a radioimmunoassay. Antigen 4D-specific antibody was detected in 95% of the sera in a Centers for Disease Control syphilis serum panel. It was also detected in 55% of 121 primary syphilis patients, whereas syphilis antibody was detected in 83% of the sera by a fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test and in 88% of the sera by a T. pallidum microhemagglutination test. In tests of 118 normal sera, less than 3% demonstrated antibody to antigen 4D; these results are similar to microhemagglutination and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test results. Rabbit antisera against Treponema phagedenis, Treponema refringens, Treponema denticola, and Treponema vincentii did not react with antigen 4D.
TI  - Adherence of oral treponemes and their effect on morphological damage and detachment of epithelial cells in vitro.
AB  - The present study shows adherence of Treponema denticola L12D and Treponema vincentii RitzA to guinea pig ear epithelial cells in vitro. The number of adhering organisms was positively related with the treponemal concentration and contact time. Incubation of washed T. denticola L12D and T. vincentii RitzA organisms or their culture supernatants with the epithelial cells induced morphological damage and detachment of these cells. In addition, indications for inhibition of epithelial cell proliferation were found. The activity of the supernatants was dose dependent, heat sensitive, and sensitive to sulfhydryl-containing components, suggesting the presence of enzymatic activity that might be of importance in the pathogenicity of these oral treponemes.
TI  - Molecular specificities of monoclonal antibodies directed against virulent Treponema pallidum.
AB  - Radioimmunoprecipitation (RIP) and Western blot analyses with specific anti-Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum monoclonal antibodies were used to identify antigens with apparent masses of 102, 84, 54, 53, 52, 47, 32, 29, and 24 kilodaltons (kDa). Cross-reactivity of these antibodies with T. pallidum subsp. pertenue antigens and lack of cross-reactivity with T. phagedenis biotype Reiter, T. vincentii, T. refringens, T. scoliodontum, and T. denticola were also demonstrated by RIP and Western blot analyses. Reactivities in the T. pallidum immobilization test, along with the RIP of lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination products, suggested that the identified antigens were surface associated. The abundance and surface association of the 47- and 84-kDa antigens were supported by reactivity in the microhemagglutination test for T. pallidum and by strong reactivity of monoclonal antibodies upon indirect immunofluorescence assays with rabbit-cultivated T. pallidum subsp. pallidum, respectively, but not with T. phagedenis biotype Reiter. Anti-47-kDa and anti-84-kDa monoclonal antibodies were also reactive in indirect immunofluorescence assays using treponemes found in dark-field-positive smears of human genital ulcers.
TI  - Characterization of monoclonal antibodies to Treponema pallidum.
AB  - Thirteen hybrid cell lines which produce mouse monoclonal antibodies to Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, have been established. All of the monoclonal antibodies react with T. pallidum, Nichols strain, in ELISA and in immunofluorescence assays, but do not react with normal rabbit testicular tissue in the ELISA. Two of these antibodies were demonstrated to react with the nonpathogenic treponemes T. phagedenis, biotype Reiter, T. refringens (Noguchi strain), T. vincentii, and T. denticola (strains 11 and W), as well as with Borrelia recurrentis, Leptospira interrogans, serogroup Canicola, and the swine pathogen T. hyodysenteriae. The remaining 11 antibodies react with four recently isolated strains of T. pallidum, but with none of the related nonpathogens nor with Borrelia or Leptospira. Thus, our results to date indicate that these monoclonal antibodies may identify antigenic determinants that are specific either for T. pallidum alone or for those treponemes which are pathogenic for humans. The molecular specificities of six of the 13 antibodies were determined by Western blotting. We anticipate potential usefulness of these antibodies in the investigation of the antigenic structure of T. pallidum, the taxonomic study of the pathogenic and nonpathogenic treponemes, and in the diagnosis of syphilis.
TI  - Suppression of fibroblast proliferation by oral spirochetes.
AB  - Soluble sonic extracts of several strains of Treponema denticola and Treponema vincentii were examined for their abilities to alter proliferation of both murine and human fibroblasts. We found that sonic extracts of all tested strains of T. denticola caused a dose-dependent inhibition of murine and human fibroblast proliferation when assessed by both DNA synthesis ([3H]thymidine incorporation) and direct cell counts. T. vincentii had only a minimal inhibitory effect at comparable doses. No inhibition was observed when sonic extracts were added simultaneously with [3H]thymidine, indicating that suppression was not due to the presence of excessive amounts of cold thymidine in the extract, nonspecific effects on thymidine utilization by the cells (transport and incorporation), or degradation of label. RNA ([3H]uridine incorporation) and protein ([3H]leucine incorporation) synthesis were similarly altered after exposure to the T. denticola sonic extracts. There was no effect on cell viability as measured by trypan blue exclusion. Inhibition could be reversed by extensive washing of the cells within the first few hours of exposure to sonic extracts. Preliminary characterization and purification indicated that the inhibitory factor(s) is not endotoxin since it is heat labile, and elutes in a single, well-defined peak on a Sephadex G-150 chromatography column corresponding to a molecular weight of approximately 50,000. Since oral spirochetes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontal disorders, it is possible that they contribute to the disease process by inhibition of fibroblast growth and therefore may, at least in part, account for the loss of collagen seen in diseased tissue.
TI  - Suppression of human lymphocyte responses by oral spirochetes: a monocyte-dependent phenomenon.
AB  - Spirochetes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several human infections  including syphilis, yaws, Lyme disease, and periodontal diseases. We examined soluble sonic extracts of oral spirochetes (Treponema denticola and T. vincentii) for their ability to alter human lymphocyte function. These organisms were isolated from subgingival plaque of patients with periodontitis. We found that sonicates of several but not all strains of T. denticola caused a dose-dependent inhibition of human lymphocyte responsiveness to Con A, PHA, PWM, and the recall antigen SKSD. Suppression involved alterations in DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis; there was no effect on cell viability. In contrast, sonicates of T. vincentii (medium-sized spirochetes) had no demonstrable effects on lymphocyte activation. The suppressive factor derived from T. denticola is heat-labile with a m.w. of approximately 100,000. To achieve maximal suppression, sonicates had to be added during the first 24 hr of incubation; there was no inhibition observed when added at 48 or 72 hr (along with 3H-TdR). Suppression was dependent on the presence of adherent monocytes; removal of these cells prevented spirochete-induced suppression of lymphocyte proliferation. Furthermore, the combination of indomethacin and catalase were able to reverse (or prevent) the inhibitory effects of the spirochete extracts, demonstrating a requirement for both prostaglandins and hydrogen peroxide. The potential role of such suppressive factors in periodontal disease is discussed.
TI  - Further evidence for hyaluronidase activity of Treponema pallidum.
AB  - The presence of hyaluronidase in preparations of Treponema pallidum was previously shown using acidified bovine serum albumin reactions and Ouchterlony immunodiffusion. To expand on these preliminary findings more sensitive techniques of viscometry, additional immunologic reactions, and altered capillary permeability were used to characterize treponemal-associated hyaluronidase. The pathogens T. pallidum and T. pertenue degraded hyaluronic acid, whereas the nonpathogens T. denticola and T. vincentii did not. As syphilitic infection progressed, hyaluronidase activity decreased; organisms harvested from 14-day testicular infections degraded hyaluronic acid less rapidly than organisms from 4-day infections. Uninfected rabbit testicular extract also exhibited significant enzyme activity. The neutralizing activity of immune sera was decreased by prior adsorption with bovine hyaluronidase, suggesting that some of the neutralizing factors are associated with this enzyme. Radioimmunoassay was used to quantitate antibodies to hyaluronidase in immune sera. Antihyaluronidase sera were isolated from rabbits immunized with bovine hyaluronidase. Treponema pallidum, as well as uninfected rabbit testicular extract, cross-reacted with these antisera. Immunofluorescence indicated that the hyaluronidase was uniformly distributed along the treponemal surface. As a final indicator of hyaluronidase activity, alterations in capillary permeability were detected 1 h after intradermal injection of T. pallidum.
TI  - Albumin requirement of Treponema denticola and Treponema vincentii.
AB  - Treponema denticola and Treponema vincentii were found to require albumin, oleic  acid, and thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) for growth. Previous studies indicated that commercial human alpha globulin, which is 50% albumin, was the only serum fraction that supported growth of these two oral treponemes. The alpha-globulin proteins were separated from the contaminating albumin with Affi-Gel Blue affinity chromatography. Both the albumin fraction and one of the alpha-globulin fractions were required for growth of T. denticola. Oleic acid was supplied by the alpha-globulin fraction and the albumin functioned as a chelator to maintain a low level of free fatty acid in the medium. Purified serum albumin (bovine or human) could substitute for the alpha-globulin fraction that contained albumin. Optimal growth of T. denticola and T. vincentii was in a medium supplemented with 0.4% (w/v) delipified albumin, 0.08 mg/mL of sodium oleate, and 25 micrograms/mL of TPP. Serum albumin tightly bound TPP (0.5 microgram of TPP per milligram of albumin). Optimal growth of T. denticola was only in an albumin-oleate supplemented medium with sufficient TPP to saturate the albumin binding sites and provide excess free TPP. Albumin bound long-chain fatty acids and thus detoxified the medium. Neither starch- nor charcoal-treated Tween 80 (polysorbitan monooleate) replaced albumin for optimal growth. Short-chain fatty acids supported only limited growth of T. denticola when added to a medium with TPP or to a medium that contained 0.4% delipified albumin and TPP.
TI  - Fumarate reduction and product formation by the Reiter strain of Treponema phagedenis.
AB  - The catabolic pathways for butyrate, acetate, succinate, and ethanol formation by the Reiter strain of Treponema phagedenis were investigated. Enzyme activities were demonstrated for glucose catabolism to pyruvate by the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway. Butyrate formation from acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) does not generate ATP by substrate level phosphorylation and involves NAD+-dependent 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase and NAD(P)+-independent butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase activities. Butyrate is formed from butyryl-CoA in a CoA transphorase reaction. Phosphate acetyltransferase and acetate kinase activities convert acetyl-CoA to acetate. An NADP+-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase participates in ethanol formation; however, the manner in which acetyl-CoA is reduced to acetaldehyde is unclear. A membrane-associated fumarate reductase was found which utilized reduced ferredoxin or flavin nucleotides as physiological electron donors. Additional electron carriers may also be involved in electron transfer for fumarate reduction. Strains of Treponema denticola, T. vincentii, and T. minutum utilized fumarate without succinate formation, whereas strains of T. phagedenis and T. refringens formed succinate from exogenously supplied fumarate.
TI  - In vitro lymphocyte blastogenic responses and titers of humoral antibodies from periodontitis patients to oral spirochete isolates.
AB  - Humoral antibodies and in vitro blastogenic responses of patients with moderate to advanced periodontitis and of orally healthy (control) individuals to 11 spirochetes were assayed. Eight isolates of Treponema denticola, two isolates of T. vincentii, and one isolate of T. phagedenis were grown anaerobically, sonicated, and centrifuged to remove cellular debris. The blastogenic responses of peripheral blood lymphocytes were measured by [3H]-thymidine uptake. Antibody titers (immunoglobulins A, G, and M) to the spirochetes were measured with the micro-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Dark-field microscopic enumeration of spirochetes was made from subgingival plaque. Spirochetes comprised 20% of the total number of microorganisms seen in plaque from the patients, whereas no spirochetes were seen in plaque from the controls. The blastogenic responses to the spirochetes were not statistically different (P greater than 0.05) between patients and controls. The immunoglobulin G and M antibody titers of the patients were generally lower than the titers of the controls, but the differences were rarely statistically significant. In contrast, the patients possessed significantly higher immunoglobulin A titers to seven spirochetes (T. denticola). No correlation was found between the percentage of spirochetes in the plaque sample and the blastogenic responses or titers of antibodies from an individual to the 11 spirochetes.
TI  - Lipid catabolism of cultivated treponemes.
AB  - Treponema require long-chain fatty acids for growth in vitro. Serum, added to culture media, provides a source of long-chain fatty acids. These fatty acids, however, are esterified to triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesterol. In this study, the major pathways of complex lipid catabolism in T. phagedenis, T. denticola, T. refringens, T. minutum, and T. vincentii were investigated. Lipase activity was demonstrated in five Treponema species using four lipid substrates. Chromatographic data demonstrated that, during growth, treponemes completely utilized lysophosphatidylcholine, present in serum-supplemented culture media, while phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol were not utilized. Phospholipase B and glycerophosphorylcholine diesterase activities were demonstrated in the five species of Treponema studied. Treponema phagedenis and T. denticola had phosphatase activity, while T. refringens, T. minutum, and T. vincentii did not have an acid phosphatase activity. Phospholipase A, C, and D and alkaline phosphatase activities were not found in five species of Treponema. Based on the enzymes demonstrated in this study, two pathways of phospholipid catabolism are proposed.
TI  - Fatty acid requirement of Treponema denticola and Treponema vincentii.
AB  - Treponema denticola and Treponema vincentii were cultured in a medium supplemented with either 0.2 or 0.4% (w/v) alpha globulin in place of serum. The active factor(s) in alpha globulin was stable at pH 7.0 to autoclaving and was nondialyzable. Extraction of lipids from alpha globulin showed that both protein and lipid, supplied by the alpha globulin, were required for maximal growth of these two oral treponemes. The lipid component was investigated by adding sodium salts of long-chain fatty acids to the basal medium supplemented with 0.4% delipified alpha globulin. The lipid component of alpha globulin was replaced by either oleic acid (cis-18:1(9)) or by elaidic acid (trans- 18:1 (9)0. No other saturated or unsaturated fatty acid tested could support good growth. Tween 80 (polysorbitan monooleate) was the only Tween compound able to support maximal growth of T. denticola. The cellular lipids of T. denticola, grown with oleate in broth supplemented with 0.4% delipified alpha globulin, were extracted and analyzed by gas chromatography. The principle fatty acids were myristic, pentadecanoic, and palmitic acids. Lesser amounts of oleic acid, eicosadienoic acid, and an unidentified fatty acid (retention time, 88 min) were also detected. Treponema denticola appears to be capable of limited synthesis of cellular fatty acids such as myristic, pentadecanoic, and palmitic acids from oleic acid.
TI  - API ZYM system for identification of Bacteroides spp., Capnocytophaga spp., and spirochetes of oral origin.
AB  - A total of 80 oral strains of Bacteroides gingivalis, B. asaccharolyticus, B. melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius, B. melaninogenicus subsp. melaninogenicus, Capnocytophaga, Treponema denticola, and T. vincentii were characterized with the API ZYM system for 19 enzyme activities. Comparison of anaerobic and aerobic incubation with nine reference strains of these organisms showed no important differences. The key differential tests for black-pigmented Bacteroides strains and treponemes of oral origin were trypsin, alpha-glucosidase, and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase. All Capnocytophaga strains produced distinctive aminopeptidase activities but varied in their glycosidic capabilities. The presence of a trypsin-like activity in B. gingivalis, T. denticola, and a group of Capnocytophaga strains may contribute to tissue destruction in periodontal disease.
