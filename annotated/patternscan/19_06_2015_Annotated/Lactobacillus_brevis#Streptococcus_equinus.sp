TI  == on the microbiological profile of traditional portuguese sourdough.
AB  == traditional manufacture of bread from maize has been noted to play important roles from both economic and social standpoints; however, enforcement of increasingly strict hygiene standards requires thorough knowledge of the adventitious microbiota of the departing dough. to this goal, sourdough as well as maize and rye flours from several geographic locations and in two different periods within the agricultural year were assayed for their microbiota in sequential steps of quantification and identification. more than 400 strains were isolated and taxonomic differentiation between them was via biomerieux api galleries (375 of which were successfully identified) following preliminary biochemical and morphological screening. the dominant groups were yeasts and lactic acid bacteria (lab). the most frequently isolated yeasts were saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida pelliculosa. the most frequently isolated lab were (heterofermentative) leuconostoc spp. and (homofermentative) lactobacillus spp.; l. brevis, l. curvatus, and l. lactis ssp. lactis were the dominant species for the lactobacillus genera; lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis for lactococci; enterococcus casseliflavus, e. durans, and e. faecium for enterococci; and streptococcus constellantus and s. equinus for streptococci.

TI  == inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-p), has been documented for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus bovis, and lactococcus lactis, but not for other gram-positive bacteria. using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated atp-dependent hpr(ser) kinase that phosphorylates ser-46 in hpr of the phosphotransferase system. a small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-p phosphatase (pase  ii), previously identified only in lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, or bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. further, lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks pase ii. the results reveal that pase ii is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-p hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. they provide correlative evidence that pase ii initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.
