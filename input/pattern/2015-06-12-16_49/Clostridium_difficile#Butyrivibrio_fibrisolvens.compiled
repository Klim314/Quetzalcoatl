TI  - Characterization of tet(32) genes from the oral metagenome.
AB  - tet(32) Was identified in three bacterial isolates and in metagenomic DNA from the human oral cavity. The regions immediately flanking the gene were found to have similarities to the mobile elements TnB1230 from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, ATE-3 from Arcanobacterium pyogenes, and CTn5 from Clostridium difficile.
TI  - Horizontal transfer of erythromycin resistance from Clostridium difficile to Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens.
AB  - This study demonstrates for the first time the in vitro transfer of the erythromycin resistance gene erm(B) between two obligate anaerobes, the human spore-forming pathogen Clostridium difficile and the rumen commensal Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, suggesting that this event might occur also in the natural environment.
