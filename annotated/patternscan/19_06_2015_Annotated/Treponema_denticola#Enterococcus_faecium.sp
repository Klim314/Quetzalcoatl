TI  == proteomic analysis of endodontic infections by liquid chromatography-tandem mass  spectrometry.
AB  == introduction: endodontic infections are very prevalent and have a polymicrobial etiology characterized by complex interrelationships between endodontic microorganisms and the host defenses. proteomic analysis of endodontic infections can provide global insights into the invasion, pathogenicity mechanisms, and multifactorial interactions existing between root canal bacteria and the host in  the initiation and progression of apical periodontitis. the purpose of this study was to apply proteomic techniques such as liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (lc-ms/ms) for the identification of proteins of bacterial origin present in endodontic infections. methods: endodontic specimens were aseptically  obtained from seven patients with root canal infections. protein mixtures were subjected to tryptic in-solution digestion and analysed by reverse-phase nano-lc-ms/ms followed by a database search. results: proteins, mainly of cell wall or membrane origin, from endodontic bacteria especially enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and treponema denticola were identified from all the samples tested. identified proteins included adhesins, autolysins, proteases, virulence factors,  and antibiotic-resistance proteins. conclusions: lc-ms/ms offers a sensitive analytical platform to study the disease processes in the root canal environment. the array of proteins expressed in endodontic infections reflects the complex microbial presence and highlights the bacterial species involved in the inflammatory process.

TI  == pcr-based identification of selected pathogens associated with endodontic infections in deciduous and permanent teeth.
AB  == objective: the aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of the selected pathogens in samples from deciduous and permanent tooth root canals by using pcr method and to determine the association of these organisms with clinical symptoms. study design: a total of 145 children, 5 to 13 years old, were involved in this study. the presence of selected pathogens (actinomyces israelii, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, streptococcus intermedius, treponema denticola, parvimonas micra, tannerella forsythensis, enterococcus faecium, prevotella melaninogenica) in infected root canals was studied using pcr. results: t. denticola (p = .012, .02) and e. faecalis (p = .012, .04) were highly associated with periapical radiolucency and previous pain, while p. gingivalis was associated with tenderness to percussion in both deciduous and permanent teeth (p = .01, .015). conclusion: the results of the present study confirm that certain species of microorganisms are associated with  clinical signs and symptoms of endodontic disease in both deciduous and permanent teeth.
