TI  == new antimicrobial contact catalyst killing antibiotic resistant clinical and waterborne pathogens.
AB  == microbial growth on medical and technical devices is a big health issue, particularly when microorganisms aggregate to form biofilms. moreover, the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the clinical environment is dramatically growing, making treatment of bacterial infections very challenging.  in search of an alternative, we studied a novel antimicrobial surface coating based on micro galvanic elements formed by silver and ruthenium with surface catalytic properties. the antimicrobial coating efficiently inhibited the growth  of the nosocomial pathogens staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium as demonstrated by the growth inhibition on agar surface and in biofilms of antibiotic resistant clinical e. faecalis, e. faecium, and s. aureus isolates. it also strongly reduced the growth of legionella in a drinking water pipeline and of escherichia coli in urine. we postulate a mode of action of the antimicrobial material, which is independent of the release of silver ions. thus, the novel antimicrobial coating could represent an alternative to combat microbial growth avoiding the toxic side effects of high levels of silver ions on eukaryotic cells.

TI  == antibacterial efficiency of vermiculite/chlorhexidine nanocomposites and results  of the in vivo test of harmlessness of vermiculite.
AB  == clay minerals have been proposed as very useful materials for modulating drug delivery. these are the commonly used materials in pharmaceutical production both as inorganic carriers or active agents. we focused on the development of suitable long-acting material for local treatment of oral infection where clay minerals act as inorganic drug carriers. organovermiculites with antibacterial activity were prepared by ion exchange reactions using different concentrations of chlorhexidine diacetate. the samples were characterized by x-ray diffraction (xrd), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir) and thermal analysis (tga). the antibacterial activity was evaluated by finding the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic). all studied organoclays possessed good antibacterial activity after 24h exposure against escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis and particularly against staphylococcus aureus. pseudomonas aeruginosa however proved very resistant as only the sample with the highest concentration of ca that successfully inhibited bacterial growth. furthermore, clay mineral vermiculite was subjected to in vivo toxicological analysis and its influence on gastrointestinal tract during its oral application was investigated. tissue samples from buccal mucosa, tongue, esophagus, stomach, terminal duodenum, small  intestine, caecum, distal colon and liver were subjected to histological examination, both macroscopically and microscopically. neither systemic nor local reactions were observed. therefore the toxicity of vermiculite to a mammal model  organism can be excluded.

TI  == aureobasidium pullulans as a source of liamocins (heavy oils) with anticancer activity.
AB  == liamocins are structurally unique, heavier-than-water "oils" produced by certain  strains of aureobasidium pullulans. the aim of the current study is to identify new sources of liamocins and evaluate their potential as anticancer agents. nine  strains of a. pullulans from phylogenetic clades 8, 9, and 11 were examined for the first time for production of liamocins. strains in these clades have only been isolated from tropical environments, and all strains tested here were from various locations in thailand. strains rsu 9, rsu 21, and rsu 29, all from clade  11, produced from 7.0 to 8.6 g liamocins/l from medium containing 5 % sucrose. these are the highest yields of liamocins that we have found thus far. these strains also produced from 9.4 to 17 g pullulan/l. the structural identity of liamocins was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry; differential spectra were obtained in which the dominant ion was either at about m/z 805.5 or m/z 949.6, consistent with the structure of liamocins. liamocins from a. pullulans strains rsu 9 and rsu 21 inhibited two human breast cancer cell lines and a human cervical cancer cell line (ic50 values of 32.2 +/- 1.4 to 63.1 +/- 2.4 mug liamocins/ml) but were not toxic to a normal  cell line. liamocins weakly inhibited a strain of enterococcus faecalis, but did  not inhibit strains of lactobacillus fermentum, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. thus, a. pullulans phylogenetic clade 11 is a promising source of liamocins, and these compounds merit further examination as potential anticancer agents.

TI  == recombinant human lipocalin 2 acts as an antibacterial agent to prevent platelet  contamination.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet products is the major infectious  risk in blood transfusion medicine, which can result in life-threatening sepsis in recipient. lipocalin 2 (lcn2) is an iron-sequestering protein in the antibacterial innate immune response, which inhibit bacterial growth. this study  was aimed to evaluate the antibacterial property of lcn2 in preventing bacterial  contamination of platelets. methods: recombinant lcn2 was expressed in a eukaryotic expression system and following purification and characterization of the recombinant lcn2, its minimum inhibitory concentration was determined. then,  platelet concentrates were inoculated with various concentrations of staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecalis, and the antibacterial effects of lcn2 was evaluated at 20-24 degrees c. results: results revealed that lcn2 effectively inhibited the growth of 1.5 x 10(4) cfu/ml s. epidermidis, p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, e. coli, and e. faecalis at 40 ng/ml. at this concentration, lcn2 also inhibited the growth of 1.5 x 10(3) cfu/ml staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis. conclusion: recombinant lcn2 inhibited growth of a variety of platelet-contaminating bacteria. therefore, supplementation of platelet concentrates with lcn2 may reduce bacterial contamination.

TI  == spiromastixones a-o, antibacterial chlorodepsidones from a deep-sea-derived spiromastix sp. fungus.
AB  == fifteen new depsidone-based analogues named spiromastixones a-o (1-15) were isolated from the fermentation broth of a deep-sea spiromastix sp. fungus. their  structures were elucidated on the basis of extensive nmr and mass spectroscopic analysis in association with chemical conversion. spiromastixones a-o are classified into two subtypes based on the orientation of ring c relative to ring  a, while the n-propyl substituents on rings a and c are rarely seen in natural products. most analogues are substituted by various numbers of chlorine atoms. all compounds exhibited significant inhibition against gram-positive bacteria including staphylococcus aureus, bacillus thuringiensis, and bacillus subtilis with mic values ranging from 0.125 to 8.0 mug/ml. in addition, compounds 6-10 displayed potent inhibitory effects against methicillin-resistant bacterial strains of s. aureus (mrsa) and s. epidermidis (mrse), while 10 also inhibited the growth of the vancomycin-resistant bacteria enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium (vre). the structure-activity relationships are discussed.

TI  == vellozia flavicans mart. ex schult. hydroalcoholic extract inhibits the neuromuscular blockade induced by bothrops jararacussu venom.
AB  == background: snakebite is a significant public health issue in tropical countries. in brazil, some of the most common snake envenomations are from bothrops. bothrops bites trigger local and systemic effects including edema, pain, erythema, cyanosis, infections, and necrosis. vellozia flavicans is a plant from  the brazilian "cerrado" (savanna) that is popularly used as an anti-inflammatory  medicine. since inflammation develops quickly after bothrops bites, which can lead to infection, the aim of the present study was to observe possible anti-snake venom and antimicrobial activities of v. flavicans (vf). methods: the  chromatographic profile of the main constituents from the vf leaf hydroalcoholic  extract was obtained by thin-layer chromatography (tlc). the anti-snake venom activity was measured by vf's ability to neutralize the in vitro neuromuscular blockade caused by bothrops jararacussu venom (bjssu) in a mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm model (pnd). after a 20 min incubation, preparations of pnd were  added to tyrode's solution (control); vf (0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/ml); 40 mug/ml bjssu; pre-incubation for 30 min with bjssu and 1 mg/ml vf; and a bjssu pretreated preparation (for 10 min) followed by 1 mg/ml vf. myographic recording  was performed, and the contractile responses were recorded. the antimicrobial activity (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic] and minimum bactericidal concentration [mbc]) was obtained for staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecalis, using gentamicin and vancomycin as positive controls. results: tlc analysis yielded several compounds  from vf, such as flavonoids (quercetin) and phenolic acids (chlorogenic acid). bjssu completely blocked the contractile responses of pnd preparations, while vf  preserved 97% (+/-10%) of the contractile responses when incubated with bjssu. in the pnd pretreated with bjssu, vf was able to inhibit the neuromuscular blockade  progress. mic and mbc of vf ranged from 2.5 to 5.0 mg/ml for p. aeruginosa and s. aureus strains, while no antimicrobial activity was observed for e. coli and e. faecalis. conclusions: the hydroalcoholic extract from vf leaves was able to neutralize and decrease the in vitro neuromuscular blockade caused by bjssu. however, it did not show significant antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection  treatment with photolysis of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 and comparing this with existing antibacterial agents. we tested seven antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, cefepime hydrochloride, erythromycin, ofloxacin, clindamycin hydrochloride, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, and minocycline hydrochloride, as positive controls for validation of the assay protocol. for all of the agents tested, at least one of the four bacterial species (staphylococcus  aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and streptococcus salivarius) was resistant to these agents by repeated exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of the agents up to 10 times. in contrast, antibacterial activity  against any of the bacterial species tested (s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. coli, s.  salivarius, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus mutans, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) was not affected by repeated exposure to the disinfection  treatment up to 40 times. this finding suggested that the risk of inducing bacterial resistance by disinfection treatment was low. the active ingredient of  this disinfection treatment is hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis of h2o2. therefore, hydroxyl radicals interact with several cell structures and different  metabolic pathways in microbial cells, probably resulting in a lack of development of bacterial resistance. in conclusion, disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 appears to be a potential alternative for existing antimicrobial agents in terms of a low risk of inducing bacterial resistance.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of amazonian medicinal plants.
AB  == objectives: the aqueous extracts of currently utilized amazonian medicinal plants were assayed in vitro searching for antimicrobial activity against human and animal pathogenic microorganisms. methods: medium resuspended lyophilized aqueous extracts of different organs of amazonian medicinal plants were assayed by in vitro screening for antimicrobial activity. atcc and standardized microorganisms  obtained from oswaldo cruz foundation/brazil were individually and homogeneously  grown in agar plate, and holes previously perforated in the gel were filled with  diluted plant aqueous extracts. inhibition halos were evaluated and controlled by the use of the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin. results: the amazonian medicinal plants, hymenelobium petraeum showed inhibitory activity over staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella enterica serovar typhi, acinetobacter baumannii and candida albicans, while vatairea guianensis and symphonia globulifera presented inhibitory activity exclusively for staphylococcus aureus.  also, ptychopetalum olacoides and pentaclethra macroloba inhibited the growth of  klebsiella ozaenae and acinetobacter baumannii. conclusion: the aqueous botanic extracts that showed activity against microroganisms of attc and osvaldo cruz strains had at least 40% of antimicrobial activity when compared to halo inhibition produced by the commercial antibiotic ciprofloxacin utilized as a control. of all plants extracts assayed, the hymenelobium petraeum had the best performance, sometimes exhibiting higher activity than ciprofloxacin. it is not well-defined by the physicians the exact indication of the majority of medicinal  plants in the amazon area in brazil. natives utilize the plants according to their symptoms, based on the traditional knowledge transmitted orally from generation to generation, among amerindians, afrodescendents and ethnic mixed populations. a significant number of amazonian medicinal plants are totally unknown related to their medicinal properties including mechanism of action and therapeutic effects, as very few information is reported in the scientific literature. a tiny amount of data is presented, as the preliminary antimicrobial  properties of the medicinal plants here accessed, under the urgent necessity of new antibiotics in the market and in face of the increased resistance of infectious microorganisms to antimicrobials.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of pleurocidin is retained in plc-2, a c-terminal 12-amino acid fragment.
AB  == an analysis of a series of five peptides composed of various portions of the pleurocidin (plc) sequence identified a l2-amino acid fragment from the c-terminus of plc, designated plc-2, as the smallest fragment that retained a antimicrobial activity comparable to that of the parent compound. mic tests in vitro with low-ionic-strength medium showed that plc-2 has potent activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus but not against enterococcus faecalis. the antifungal activity of the synthetic peptides against phytopathogenic fungi, such as fusarium oxysporum, colletotrichum sp., aspergillus niger and alternaria sp., also identified plc-2 as a biologically active peptide. microscopy studies of fluorescently stained fungi treated with plc-2 demonstrated that cytoplasmic and nuclear membranes were compromised in all strains of phytopathogenic fungi tested. together, these results identify plc-2 as a potential antimicrobial agent with similar properties to its parent compound, pleurocidin. in addition, it demonstrated that the khvgkaalthyl residues are critical for the antimicrobial activity described for pleurocidin.

AB  == the antibacterial mechanisms of rhodomyrtone, a member of the acylphloroglucinols isolated from rhodomyrtus tomentosa leaves, against important hospital-acquired antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria were assessed. the results indicated that rhodomyrtone exhibited pronounced antibacterial activity against key antibiotic-resistant pathogens including epidemic meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (emrsa), vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcal strains. the strains emrsa-16, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212 and vre-3 demonstrated a significant decrease in survival ability after treatment with rhodomyrtone at 1x (0.5 microg ml(-1)), 2x, 4x and 8x mic for 24 h. moreover, the compound was observed in the cytoplasmic fraction  of rhodomyrtone-treated s. aureus, and only a very fine band of the compound was  seen following separation of the cell-wall and cell-membrane fractions of the treated cells. in addition, exposure of s. aureus to rhodomyrtone at 4x, 2x and 1x mic for 24 h produced no significant effect on the bacterial cell membrane and cell lysis, suggesting that neither of these is the main target of rhodomyrtone action in these organisms. stepwise isolation of the bacterial cells with increasing resistance to rhodomyrtone was not induced in either s. aureus or emrsa-16 after 45 passages on luria-bertani agar supplemented with rhodomyrtone.  in addition, in vitro toxicity of rhodomyrtone at 128x mic on human erythrocytes  was not observed. these results provide evidence to support therapeutic challenges of rhodomyrtone against gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == wfdc2 is differentially expressed in the mammary gland of the tammar wallaby and  provides immune protection to the mammary gland and the developing pouch young.
AB  == wap four disulfide core domain 2 (wfdc2) is a four disulfide core (4-dsc) protein secreted in the milk of the tammar wallaby. it is comprised of two 4-dsc domains  assigned domain iii at the nh2-terminal end and domain ii at the cooh-terminal end. the wfdc2 gene was expressed only during pregnancy, early lactation, towards the end of lactation and involution. the wfdc2 protein showed antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica and pseudomonas aeruginosa and this activity resided with domain ii. there was no antibacterial activity detected against enterococcus faecalis. the observed expression pattern  of tammar wfdc2 and its antibacterial activity suggests a role to either reduce mastitis in the mammary gland caused by s. aureus or to protect the gut of the young at a time when it is not immune-competent. the latter effect could be achieved without disturbing the balance of commensal gut flora such as e. faecalis.

AB  == human beta-defensin-3 (hbd3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. this study aimed to obtain recombinant hbd3 (rhbd3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of hbd3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. genetic engineering was used to obtain active rhbd3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals,  including fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus  anaerobius, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans. in an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rhbd3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. the ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. we conclude that hbd3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.

TI  == characteristics of an environmental strain, enterococcus faecalis cect7121, and its effects as additive on craft dry-fermented sausages.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria are the most adequate microorganisms for natural preservation of food. in the present work, the strain of enterococcus faecalis cect7121 was employed in the manufacture of craft dry-fermented sausages and its  performance as a biopreservative was analysed. this strain is devoid of the genes for haemolysin and gelatinase and does not produce biogenic amines. it is sensitive to almost all the antibiotics tested and opsonophagocytic assays showed that it is devoid of a capsule. this strain had a high ld50 (10(11)cfu ml(-1)) in mice. no statistical differences were found between control and sausages inoculated with e. faecalis cect7121 regarding the production of lactic acid, ph  variation over time, reaching a minimum ph value of 5.1, and sensory analysis in  both series. sausages inoculated with e. faecalis cect7121 had lower viable counts of enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus and other gram-positive cocci at the end of fermentation and 7 days and no viable enterobacteria and s. aureus  were recovered at the end of drying. e. faecalis cect7121 did not affect the growth of lactobacillus spp. but it displaced the autochthonous populations of enterococci. e. faecalis cect7121 was recovered in each time point as assessed by its inhibitory activity on listeria monocytogenes and s. aureus. these results would indicate that the addition of e. faecalis cect7121 during the manufacture of craft dry-fermented sausages offers an interesting alternative for biopreservation.

AB  == bacterial enoyl-acp reductase (fabi) is responsible for catalyzing the final step of bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis and is an attractive target for the development of novel antibacterial agents. previously we reported the development of fabi inhibitor 4 with narrow spectrum antimicrobial activity and in vivo efficacy against staphylococcus aureus via intraperitoneal (ip) administration. through iterative medicinal chemistry aided by x-ray crystal structure analysis,  a new series of inhibitors has been developed with greatly increased potency against fabi-containing organisms. several of these new inhibitors have potent antibacterial activity against multidrug resistant strains of s. aureus, and compound 30 demonstrates exceptional oral (po) in vivo efficacy in a s. aureus infection model in rats. while optimizing fabi inhibitory activity, compounds 29  and 30 were identified as having low micromolar fabk inhibitory activity, thereby increasing the antimicrobial spectrum of these compounds to include the fabk-containing pathogens streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis. the results described herein support the hypothesis that bacterial enoyl-acp reductases are valid targets for antibacterial agents.

TI  == the lactoperoxidase system increases efficacy of high-pressure inactivation of foodborne bacteria.
AB  == the inactivation of eight different bacteria comprising escherichia coli lmm1010  and mg1655, respectively a pressure-resistant strain and the corresponding wild-type, salmonella typhimurium, pseudomonas fluorescens, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua and lactobacillus plantarum, by high hydrostatic pressure in skim milk supplemented with the lactoperoxidase-hydrogen peroxide-thiocyanate (lp) system at naturally occurring  concentration was studied. in the absence of pressure treatment, the lp system had either no effect, i.e. on s. typhimurium and e. coli lmm1010, a growth inhibiting effect, i.e. on e. coli mg1655, l. innocua, s. aureus, l. plantarum and e. faecalis, or a bactericidal effect, i.e. on p. fluorescens. the presence of the lp system affected inactivation by high pressure in a cell density-dependent manner. at low cell concentration (10(6) cfu/ml), the lp system strongly increased high-pressure inactivation as measured immediately after pressure treatment of all bacteria except the pressure-resistant e. coli. at high cell density (10(9) cfu/ml), only inactivation of l. innocua, e. faecalis and l.  plantarum were enhanced. for both e. coli strains, the fate of the bacteria during 24 h following pressure treatment was also studied. it was found that in the presence of the lp system, considerable further inactivation occurred in the  first hours after pressure treatment. the potential of the lp system to improve the bactericidal efficiency of high-pressure treatment for food preservation is discussed.

AB  == five-hundred forty four bacterial strains isolated from 412 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 9 institutions in japan were supplied between the period of august 1999 to july 2000. then, the clinical background of  patients were investigated such as sex, age and type of infections, infections and kind of bacteria, frequency of isolation of bacteria by age and infections, bacteria and infections by timing of administration of antibiotics, and bacteria  and infections by surgical procedures. about the relationship between age and sex of patients and type of infections, the number of male patients aged less than 50 years was few, and complicated utis without indwelling catheter was the most frequent. in females, the number of patients aged less than 20 years was few. complicated utis without indwelling catheter was the most frequent among female patients aged between 40 to 59 years, in other age groups, uncomplicated utis was most frequent. as for type of infections and kind of bacteria, escherichia coli decreased when the infections became complicated, and pseudomonas aeruginosa and  enterococcus faecalis increased when the infection became complicated. considering this result by age of patients, isolation frequency of e. coli was gradually decreased with aging in patients aged more than 20 years with uncomplicated utis or complicated utis without indwelling catheter. the isolation frequencies of e. faecalis and staphylococcus aureus were gradually increased with aging in complicated utis without indwelling catheter. in patients with complicated utis with indwelling catheter, there was no difference between age group, and p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis were frequently isolated. as for type of causative organisms in utis before and after the administration of antibiotics, the isolation of bacteria was remarkably decreased after administration in patients with uncomplicated utis and complicated utis without indwelling catheter. e. coli decreased after administration of antibiotics, and p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis increased after administration in patients with all infections. as for type of causative organisms in utis and surgical procedures, e. coli were more frequently isolated in patients with uncomplicated utis when surgical procedures were experienced. also, klebsiella spp. and e. faecalis were  more frequently isolated in patients with surgical procedures. however, in complicated utis, type of causative organisms had no relationship with surgical procedures.

AB  == staphylococcus aureus ab201, a clinical isolate from wound pus, produced a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance termed as bac201, that was inhibitory to streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, neisseria meningitidis and a number of staphylococcal species. it was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration (biosil-sec-125), and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (vydac c4). the native  bac201 was sized at approximately 170-kda as determined by gf hplc. fraction-i (native bac201), having antibacterial activity was also examined by transmission  electron microscopy and appeared as globular structure showing resemblance with phage-like objects. the purification of bac201 resulted in 466-fold increase in specific activity and recovery of 0.94% of total antibacterial activity. the purified bac201 migrated as single band on sds-page with an estimated molecular mass of about 41-kda. bac201 was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes, resistant to heat and organic solvents, and active over a wide range of ph (2.5-10). the amino acid composition revealed a general resemblance with other reported high molecular mass bacteriocins and predominance of glycine (39%), proline (13%) and  alanine (8%) residues. further results showed that bac201 has a bactericidal effect on sensitive cells which is not produced by either cell lysis or apparent  loss of membrane permeability.

TI  == the preliminary isolation of several antibacterial compounds from combretum erythrophyllum (combretaceae).
AB  == freeze dried ground leaves of combretum erythrophyllum were extracted with different extractants to determine if they contain inhibitors of pathogenic bacteria. acetone yielded the most compounds inhibiting the growth of staphylococcus aureus using bioautography of thin layer chromatography plates. acetone also extracted many different compounds and group separation was attempted by solid phase extraction on reverse and normal phase silica gel. both  techniques separated the bioactive components to a degree. the best group separation results, however, were obtained using liquid/liquid extraction. the six fractions obtained inhibited the four test organisms to different degrees. s. aureus was the most sensitive (100%) followed by enterococcus faecalis (36%), escherichia coli (11%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (3%). with s. aureus as test organism, the chloroform soluble fraction contained by far the largest quantity of inhibiting components (100%), followed by the fractions soluble in water (23%), 35% methanol in water (18%), butanol (5%), carbon tetrachloride (2%) and hexane (traces). the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration for s. aureus was 0.05 mg/ml at this stage of purification compared to mic values of 0.08 and 0.16  mg/ml for ampicillin and chloramphenicol. there were at least 14 different inhibitors with a wide range of polarities present in the different fractions. the polar components apparently did not contain polysaccharides and were probably basic according to the chromatographic behaviour.

TI  == influence of lipoteichoic acid structure on recognition by the macrophage scavenger receptor.
AB  == lipoteichoic acids (ltas) belong to the immunostimulatory class of molecules of gram-positive bacteria (gpb). previous investigations showed that the macrophage  scavenger receptor (sr), a glycosylated trimeric transmembrane protein, binds directly to many gpb, possibly via lta. sr binding to other ligands is dependent  upon the spatial characteristics of the repeating negative charge of the ligand.  we therefore investigated sr recognition of lta species with various charge densities and distributions by determining the capacity of these ltas to compete  with the binding of metabolically labeled sr to beads coated with the known sr ligand polyguanylic acid. staphylococcus aureus lta, a classical lta type (unbranched 1,3-linked polyglycerophosphate chain covalently bound to a membrane  diacylglyceroglycolipid), had a 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) for inhibition of sr binding of 0.84 microg/ml. when the s. aureus lta was rendered more negatively charged by removal of ester-linked alanine from the polyglycerophosphate backbone, the ic50 dropped to 0.23 microg/ml. other polyglycerophosphate ltas from enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, listeria monocytogenes, listeria welshimeri, and streptococcus sanguis showed ic50s of 0.5 to 2.1 microg/ml, supporting the role of negative charge in binding to sr. accordingly, the zwitterionic lta of streptococcus pneumoniae and clostridium innocuum lta substituted with positively charged sugar residues had no binding capacity. monoglycerophosphate branches, but not succinyl ester, affected binding of lipoglycans. the data presented above parallel the previous findings for whole organisms and support the role of surface-associated lta as a major ligand of gpb for binding to sr. whether binding of lta and whole gpb to macrophages initiates uptake and degradation or results in signal transduction remains to be determined.

AB  == the bactericidal activities of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and dr-3355 have been investigated against enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis over 24 h. the three fluoroquinolones were found to be rapidly bactericidal against the staphylococci, killing over 99% of the bacteria  during the first 3 h of exposure with a further reduction in viability of approximately one logarithm occurring over the next 21 h. in contrast, the fluoroquinolones displayed a much slower rate of kill against e. faecalis, as little or no bactericidal activity was detected over the first 3 h for both e. faecalis atcc19433 and a clinical isolate. at 6 h all three of the drugs were bactericidal against the enterococci although the amount of kill was not as great as against the staphylococci. however, at 24 h the amount of kill obtained with all three drugs was similar to that obtained for staphylococci exposed to these drugs. ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and dr-3355 were not active against e. faecalis atcc19433 in phosphate buffered saline and therefore require cell division for their bactericidal activity against this species.

TI  == in vitro postantibiotic effect of daptomycin (ly146032) against enterococcus faecalis and methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains.
AB  == the suppression of bacterial growth that persists after brief exposure to antimicrobial agents has been termed the postantibiotic effect (pae). this pharmacodynamic interaction varies for each microorganism-antimicrobial agent combination. daptomycin (ly146032) is a new lipopeptide antibiotic with activity  against gram-positive organisms. we studied the in vitro bactericidal activities  and paes of the following drugs: daptomycin compared with penicillin g and vancomycin, without and with gentamicin against enterococcus faecalis strains; daptomycin compared with nafcillin and vancomycin against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains; and daptomycin compared with vancomycin against methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains. daptomycin, alone and when used in combination with gentamicin, exhibited greater bactericidal activity and in general produced a longer pae than standard effective regimens against the organism strains studied.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of ceftizoxime. observation from mic and ceftizoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  == in vitro activities of ceftizoxime (czx) against 328 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. czx was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and proteus vulgaris with mic values below 0.20 microgram/ml. it was also active against serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes with mic85 of  3.13 micrograms/ml. czx was less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, showing inhibitory activities against only 47 and 78% of these clinical isolates, respectively, at a dose level of 12.5 micrograms/ml.  czx was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis. the  reliability of czx disc diffusion susceptibility tests for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter  discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (eiken), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of czx. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the czx disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of czx, except against p. aeruginosa and e.  faecalis. for the interpretation of czx disc tests, a 3 category system has been  used in usa and europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in japan. the 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to mic values as follows: resistant (r) mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (ms) mic 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (s) mic less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at  250 words)

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of ly146032 (daptomycin) against gram-positive cocci.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ly146032 was compared with those of seven other antimicrobial agents against gram-positive cocci. mics of ly146032 were lowest for streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (0.25 mg/l). for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus the mics were 1 mg/l, for enterococcus faecalis 2 mg/l and  for enterococcus faecium 4 mg/l. the activity of ly146032 was in general higher than that of vancomycin. time-kill studies showed ly146032 had higher bactericidal activity than vancomycin against a methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strain, and bactericidal activity against enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium.
